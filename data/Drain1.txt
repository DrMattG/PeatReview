AB The draining of mires for silvicultural purposes has caused one of the most dramatic changes in the landscape during the last century in Finland. To study the effects of mire drainage, carabid beetle assemblages were sampled using pitfall trapping in three different mire habitat types. Carabids were sampled from mires in their natural state, drained mires and drained mires with an open power line to see whether the cleared power line can serve as an alternative habitat for mire dependent carabids. The draining of mires greatly increases the species richness of the carabid assemblages. Yet, the conservation value of the environment has dropped following the draining, since only common and abundant forest carabids have benefited from human impact. The role of the open power line as an alternative habitat for mire specialists remains questionable. A few carabid species have, however, benefited from the open habitat of the power line. The vegetation structure had a significant effect in determining the compositions of the carabid assemblages on the studied habitat types. It seems that mire dwelling carabids cannot survive on the drained mires, unless at least some characteristics, other than the mere openness of the cleared power lines, of natural mires remain.

AB Peatlands are significant global carbon stores and play an important role in mediating the flux of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. During the 20th century substantial areas of northern peatlands were drained to repurpose the land for industrial or agricultural use. Drained peatlands have dysfunctional microbial communities, which can lead to net carbon emissions. Rewetting of drained peatlands is therefore an environmental priority, yet our understanding of the effects of peatland drainage and rewetting on microbial communities is still incomplete. Here we summarize the last decade of research into the response of the wider microbial community, methane-cycling microorganisms, and micro-fauna to drainage and rewetting in fens and bogs in Europe and North America. Emphasis is placed on current research methodologies and their limitations. We propose targets for future work including: accounting for timescale of drainage and rewetting events; better vertical and lateral coverage of samples across a peatland; the integration of proteomic and metabolomic datasets into functional community analysis; the use of RNA sequencing to differentiate the active community from legacy DNA; and further study into the response of the viral and micro-faunal communities to peatland drainage and rewetting. This review should benefit researchers embarking on studies in wetland microbiology and non-microbiologists working on peatland drainage and rewetting in general.

AB Effects of peatland drainage on the incubation success of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) eggs placed inside gravel-filled boxes were studied in two boreal humic rivers in northern Finland. The survival was 53-84% at the eyed egg stage and as low as 0.2-9.1% at the pre-emergence stage, depending on the site. The lowest survivals were recorded at sites affected by peatland drainage. The survival was inversely related to particulate matter and Fe loading from drained peatlands. The results indicate that the increase in the Fe content of high molecular weight dissolved organic matter transported to rivers followed by its precipitation and sedimentation on the river bed may be a crucial factor in weakening the conditions for salmonid reproduction downstream of peatland drainage areas.

AB Knowledge of the hydrological mechanisms behind habitat fragmentation of fen plant communities in intensively managed regions like The Netherlands is essential to improve currently utilized fen restoration and conservation strategies. In this study, we analysed the local and regional impact of anthropogenic drainage on the groundwater supply of fens. For this purpose, we developed fine-scale groundwater flow models and collected empirical data to analyse (1) the differences in groundwater supply between an anthropogenically drained fen and a poorly drained fen in The Netherlands, and (2) the local and regional effects of the elimination of drainage ditches on the groundwater supply of fens. Our results consistently indicated the presence of recently infiltrated precipitation on top of upwelling groundwater across the anthropogenically drained fen, and a mixing gradient of recently infiltrated precipitation and upwelling groundwater across the poorly drained fen. Furthermore, our results showed that the elimination of drainage ditches from the anthropogenically drained fen increased the area and the flux of groundwater supply of both the anthropogenically drained fen and the poorly drained fen. We conclude that anthropogenic drainage not only causes a lowering of groundwater tables, but also (1) enhances the infiltration of local precipitation across fens while simultaneously preventing upwelling groundwater from entering the fen root zone, and (2) reduces the groundwater supply of adjacent fens by intercepting groundwater that is potentially directed to downstream regions. These insights support the need to reconsider the current priorities in hydrological fen restoration strategies.

AB A recent study on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) exports from drained peatland forests reported increasing concentrations over long time since their initial drainage. Concurrently, some other studies have suggested decreasing trends from drained peatland forests, particularly for P. To evaluate these contradictory findings, we re-analyzed past data and reviewed the literature related to temporal N and P concentration trends in runoff from drained peatland forests. Review of literature indicated that decreasing trends are found particularly in sites where initial P concentrations are high (> 50 mu g P l(-1)), plausibly because of relatively recent fertilization and drainage operations. Decreasing N trends have been found in sites where ditch cleaning temporarily decreased concentrations. Increasing N trends have occurred in sites, where initial concentrations have been low, close to the levels found in pristine peatlands. Complementing past published data with additional data from sites with no recent forestry operations indicated that N concentrations correlated positively with drainage age (years since initial drainage), percentage of drained peatlands in the catchment (drainage proportion), and southern location of the study site. P concentrations correlated most strongly with drainage age. Our study indicated that four factors, in particular, need to be considered when interpreting nutrient concentration trends in runoff from drained peatlands: 1) management history, 2) drainage age, 3) drainage proportion, and 4) site location. Our results supported earlier conclusions in that the estimates which ignore the legacy effect of drainage remarkably underestimate the true impact of forestry on water courses in intensively drained regions.

AB Water tables in high-latitude peatlands are expected to fall because of climate change, with significant consequences for carbon cycling in these ecosystems. At present, the understanding of how climate-induced changes will affect soil microbial communities and functions in peatlands still remains controversial. In this study, we compared the potential activities of soil oxidase and hydrolytic enzymes and microbial communities at different depths in a minerotrophic peatland, part of which had been drained for many years and part of which was natural. The results showed that the microbial communities and enzyme activities differed considerably between the drained peat and the natural peat, and that the degree of change varied by depth in the profile. The soil oxidase activities and hydrolase activities (beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase and acid phosphatase) in the oxic zone (0-10 cm) were higher in the drained peat than in the natural peat, but the beta-1,4-glucosidase activities decreased in the oxic zone after drainage. Soil enzyme activities in the anoxic zone were lower in the drained peat than in the natural peat. This suggests that drainage disturbance in this peatland does not support enhanced oxidative enzyme activity as hypothesized by the "enzyme-latch" mechanism. The soil total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and bacterial, fungal, and actinomycetic PLFAs in the oxic zone were lower in the drained peat than in the natural peat. The total PLFAs and bacterial PLFAs were higher in the transitional zone of the drained peat than the natural peat, but remained similar in the anoxic zone of the drained and natural peat. The fungi/bacteria and gram-positive/gram-negative ratios were lower in the drained peat than in the natural peat. The soil bacterial communities was strongly and positively linked with the beta-1,4-glucosidase activities involved in carbon transformation, whereas the fungi was positively associated with oxidase activities driving carbon oxidation. We found that these variations in the microbial communities and enzyme activities were associated with differences in the litter quality, soil organic carbon, soil moisture content, and the pH between the drained peat and natural peat. These observations indicate a modification in microbial communities and their activities reflective of changing peat C cycling. The observed reduction in microbial biomass with peatland drainage appears to have also resulted in reductions in enzyme activity suggesting potential limits to the 'enzyme-latch' mechanism for peatland C loss following longer-term drainage.

AB In addition to traditional sources, drained peat soils have been found to be a significant source of nitrogen in Estonia. As a result, supplementary measures are required to improve water quality in rivers. Modelling is a widespread method to select means for improving water quality. At present, modelling of nitrogen in rivers has been concentrated on the influence of agricultural activity. However, drained peat can increase nitrogen concentrations even without fertilization and farming activities. This investigation describes the attempt to model water quality in the watershed with a large share of drained peat soils. The results showed a good alignment between measured and modelled nitrate concentrations using the MACRO and the SOILN for MACRO models. Some measures to improve water quality were tested using these models.

AB Degradation of peatlands via drainage is increasing globally and destabilizing peat carbon (C) stores. The effects of drainage on the timing and magnitude of lateral C losses from degraded peatlands remains understudied. We measured spatial and temporal variability in lateral C exports from three drained peat islands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California across the 2017 and 2018 water years using measurements of dissolved inorganic C (DIC), dissolved organic C (DOC), and suspended particulate organic C (POC) concentration combined with discharge. These measurements were supplemented with stable isotope data (delta C-13-DIC, delta C-13-POC, delta N-15-PON, and delta H-2-H2O values) to provide insight into hydrological and biogeochemical controls on lateral C exports from drained peatlands. Drainage DOC and DIC concentrations were seasonally variable with the highest values in the winter rainy season, when discharge was also elevated. Seasonal differences in the mobilization of dissolved C appeared to result from changing water sources and water table levels. Peat island drainage C contributions to surrounding waterways were also greatest during the winter. Although temporal variability in C cycling processes and trends were generally similar across islands, baseline drainage DIC, DOC, and POC concentrations were spatially variable, likely a result of sub-island-scale differences in soil organic matter content and hydrology. This spatial variability complicates system-wide assessments of C budgets. Net lateral C exports were water year dependent and comparable to previously published vertical C emission rates for this system. This work highlights the importance of including lateral C exports from drained peatlands in local and regional C budgets.

AB Drained peatland catchments are reported to produce more colored, dissolved organic carbon (DOC)-rich water, presenting problems for potable water treatment. The blocking of peatland drainage ditches to restore the water table is increasingly being considered as a strategy to address this deterioration in water quality. However, the effect of ditch blocking on the potential of DOC to form trihalomethanes (THMs) has not been assessed. In this study, the effect of peat rewetting on pore water DOC concentration and characteristics (including THM formation potential [THMFP]) was assessed over 12 months using peat cores collected from two drained peatland sites. The data show little evidence of differences in DOC concentration or characteristics between the different treatments. The absence of any difference in the THMFP of pore water between treatments suggests that, in the short term at least, ditch blocking may not have an effect on the THMFP of waters draining peatland catchments.

AB Growing bioeconomy is increasing the pressure to clear-cut drained peatland forests. Yet, the cumulative effects of peatland drainage and clear-cutting on the biodiversity of recipient freshwater ecosystems are largely unknown.
   We studied the isolated and combined effects of peatland drainage and clear-cutting on stream macroinvertebrate communities. We further explored whether the impact of these forestry-driven catchment alterations to benthic invertebrates is related to stream size. We quantified the impact on invertebrate biodiversity by comparing communities in forestry-impacted streams to expected communities modelled with a multi-taxon niche model.
   The impact of clear-cutting of drained peatland forests exceeded the sum of the independent effects of drainage and clear-cutting, indicating a synergistic interaction between the two disturbances in small streams. Peatland drainage reduced benthic biodiversity in both small and large streams, whereas clear-cutting did the same only in small streams. Small headwater streams were more sensitive to forestry impacts than the larger downstream sites.
   We found 11 taxa (out of 25 modelled) to respond to forestry disturbances. These taxa were mainly different from those previously reported as sensitive to forestry-driven alterations, indicating the context dependence of taxonomic responses to forestry. In contrast, most of the functional traits previously identified as responsive to agricultural sedimentation also responded to forestry pressures. In particular, taxa that live temporarily in hyporheic habitats, move by crawling, disperse actively in water, live longer than 1 year, use eggs as resistance form and obtain their food by scraping became less abundant than expected, particularly in streams impacted by both drainage and clear-cutting.
   Synthesis and applications. Drained peatland forests in boreal areas are reaching maturity and will soon be harvested. Clear-cutting of these forests incurs multiple environmental hazards but previous studies have focused on terrestrial ecosystems. Our results show that the combined impacts of peatland drainage and clear-cutting may extend across ecosystem boundaries and cause significant biodiversity loss in recipient freshwater ecosystems. This information supports a paradigm shift in boreal forest management, whereby continuous-cover forestry based on partial harvest may provide the most sustainable approach to peatland forestry.

AB Methane (CH4) fluxes were measured at 17 peatland sites with different nutritional and hydrological characteristics in the southern and middle boreal zones in Finland by a static chamber technique. Many of the natural peatlands also had counterparts drained for forestry 30-50 years ago. The mean emissions from May to September were 8.0 g CH4 m(-2) for natural ombrogenous bogs and 19.0 g CH4 m(-2) for natural minerogenous fens thus being higher than the 2 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) estimated for the Canadian peatlands. Change in the mean water table level had greater effect on CH4 fluxes on natural fens than on natural bogs. The mean CH4 emissions on drained bogs and fens were 3.9 g CH4 m(-2) and 0.3 g CH4 m(-2), respectively. Some drained fens even had CH4 uptake from the atmosphere. The change in the mean water table had the lowest effect on CH4 fluxes on drained peatlands. The CH4 fluxes on peatlands (natural fens and bogs and drained peatlands) are associated with peat aeration, nutrient level, vegetation cover, peat compaction, peat temperature, and finally with microbial processes responsible for the net release of CH4. We could explain 67% of the variation in mean CH4 fluxes on Finnish peatlands by measuring the mean water table, peat bulk density, and peat pH. The present results can be used to predict the possible changes in CH4 emissions on peatlands if the climate is drying in north. For example, lowering of the present water table by 10 cm would induce a 70% reduction in the CH4 emissions from fens and a 45% reduction from bogs.

AB Peatlands are one of the major natural sources of methane (CH4), but the level of CH4 efflux is uncertain, especially in alpine peatlands. In this study, CH4 emission fluxes from natural and drained peatlands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, southwest China, were measured from June to October in 2013 using the opaque static chamber technique and the Fast Greenhouse Gas Analyzer (DLT-100, Los Gatos Research Corp.). CH4 emission fluxes ranged from 2.07 to 56.33 mg m(-2) h(-1) in natural peatlands and from 0.02 to 0.42 mg m(-2) h(-1) in drained peatlands. Mean CH4 emission flux was 19.13 mg m(-2) h(-1) in natural peatlands and 0.14 mg m(-2) h(-1) in drained peatlands. These results showed that drainage led to a significant decrease in CH4 emissions. CH4 emission fluxes for all sampling plots were significantly correlated with variation in water table depth for linear (R (2) = 0.453, P < 0.01) and exponential functions (R (2) = 0.429, P < 0.01).

AB Past land use change has converted vast areas of Northern peatland by drainage to agricultural or forested land. This change often reduces the greenhouse gas (GHG) sink strength of peatlands or turns them even from sinks to sources, which affects the global climate. Therefore, there is a need for suitable mitigation options for GHG emissions from drained peatlands. Addition of wood ash to peatland forests has been suggested as such a measure, but the overall effect on the global warming potential (GWP) of these ecosystems is still unclear. In order to fill this knowledge gap, we investigated three drained peatland forests in Sweden that had been fertilized with wood ash and monitored stand growth as well as the GHG emissions from soil, i.e. net effluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Our results show that over the first five to eight years after wood ash application, tree growth was enhanced at all sites. This was accompanied by generally little changes in the GHG emissions. Overall, we found that wood ash application reduced the GWP of drained peatland forests. Even though that our study was limited to eight years after wood ash application, we can conclude that in the short term wood ash application may be a suitable mitigation option for GHG emissions from Northern drained peatland forests.

The regularities of the morphological structure of the peat and peat horizons transforming in the process of the agrogenic evolution of peat soils were revealed. Four stages of the agrogenic evolution of the soils were distinguished: drained peat, peat-mineral, organomineral, and postpeat mineral soils. The main morphological features of these soils and their differences at different stages of the agrogenic evolution are described. A taxonomy of the soils formed at the different stages of the peat degradation is suggested.

AB Drainage-driven changes in peatland ecosystems in Finland were studied, using aerial photographs taken in 1995 and 1946. The species composition of the vegetation cover was examined in one drained and one undrained mire in 1995. The data were correlated with tone and texture values of digitized colour infrared aerial photographs taken the same year, using canonical correspondence analysis. The results obtained were used to reconstruct the vegetation cover of the aerial photograph from 1946. The analysis clearly differentiated drained and undrained mire site types from each other, forming the moisture gradient in the first axis. The undrained mire site types were distributed along the nutrient gradient, but the correlation between site types and different tone values was relatively weak. The main difference between 1946 and 1995 was that the open and sparsely forested peatland vegetation types diminished and two drained mire site types (drained, pine-dominated Vaccinium type and drained, pine-dominated dwarf shrub type) became dominant. Digitized aerial photographs were unable to identify the vegetation at the mire site-type level, especially in natural habitats.

AB Peat drainage, a common land-use practice in Europe, has been associated with habitat degradation and increased particulate and dissolved carbon release. In the UK, peatland drain blockage has been encouraged in recent years as a management practice to preserve peatland habitats and to reduce fluvial carbon loss and municipal water discoloration. Drain blockage has, however, been found to increase drain-water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and coloration in the short term. In order to investigate the contribution of changes in extracellular phenol oxidase activity to the increase in water coloration following peatland drain blockage, cores collected from a riparian peatland in North Wales were incubated under impeded drainage conditions. Impeded drainage resulted in the stimulation of peat extracellular phenol oxidase activity and heightened soluble phenolic concentrations, suggesting that changes in extracellular phenol oxidase activity may be a key driver of increases in DOC and water coloration following peatland drain blockage. An increase in peat pH with impeded drainage was also observed that may have contributed to the heightened soluble phenolic concentrations - directly (through effects on solubility) and/or indirectly as a driver of the elevated extracellular phenol oxidase activity.

AB Peat extraction for energy purposes causes major changes in the aquatic and terrestrial environment. According to national strategies for extracting peat in Finland, new peat extraction areas should be established on previously drained peatlands. On such areas it is difficult to find the natural, intact peatland required for treatment wetlands or so-called overland flow areas, which are considered the best available technology for runoff water purification. Therefore treatment wetlands must be constructed on drained peatland. It is known that drainage causes physical, biogeochemical and hydraulic changes in the peat layer, as well as changes in vegetation. It is probable that these changes affect the purification efficiency of wetland treatment systems in many ways. This study evaluated the function and characteristics of drained peatland areas for purification of peat extraction runoff water. Study sites were established on 11 drained wetlands and their purification efficiency was evaluated. Detailed measurements of peat physical properties and hydraulic conductivity, as well as studies on vegetation, were also made in the study areas. The results showed that wetlands constructed on drained peatland areas can purify peat extraction runoff. However, leaching of phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) was observed in some areas. Leaching is influenced e.g. by pH and the soil P pool. The chemical oxygen demand was also observed to increase in runoff water from the wetland. The results indicated that low (Fe + aluminium (Al) + manganese (Mn))/P ratio (<= 25) and quite high P content (>1200 mg/kg) in the surface peat characterised those areas where P leaching was observed. The presence of a dense tree stand in a drained peatland area also seemed to indicate release of nutrients from the area after its rewetting and use as a treatment wetland. Thus, potential nutrient release from a drained peatland area intended for use as a treatment wetland can be assessed by studying the characteristics of the peatland area, especially the peat mineral content, and the vegetation, especially tree stand density in the area. Using the findings obtained, a conceptual decision tree was drawn up in order to help to establish and design wetlands in previously drained peatland areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI ECOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE STATE OF ACTINOMYCETE COMPLEXES IN

SO MICROBIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Representatives of the genera Streptomyces, Micromanospora, Saccharomonospora, Streptosporangium, and actinomycetes, arbitrarily combined into a group of ''Micropolyspora,'' were found in tile actinomycete complexes of drained peat bogs using selective techniques of actinomycete isolation and counting. Actinomycete complexes of drained peat bogs were characterized by the constant presence of saccharomonosporas and micropolysporas, rarely occurring in zonal soils, the predominance of micromonosporas over streptomycetes, and a high density and diversity of actinomycetes throughout the soil profile. The peat bed exhaustion and subsequent recultivation disturbed the structure of the complex, namely the composition and density of dominants, generic diversity, and the ratio of typical and random species. Vertical stratification of actinomycetes in biocenoses of drained peat bogs was revealed. It was characterized by both continuity and discreteness of the distribution of actinomycete genera along the vertical, layer structure of the biogeocenoses. While continuous distribution was specific to streptomycetes, discreteness was observed in the distribution of other genera. It was shown that in the actinomycete complexes of drained peat bogs, competitive relations are most possible between mono- and oligosporous actinomycetes.

AB There is a long history of drainage of blanket peat but few studies of the long-term hydrological impact of drainage. This paper aims to test differences in runoff production processes between intact and drained blanket peat catchments and determine whether there have been any long-term changes in stream How since drainage occurred. Hillslope runoff processes and stream discharge were measured in four blanket peat catchments. Two catchments were drained with open-cut ditches in the 1950s. Ditching originally resulted in shorter lag times and flashier storm hydrographs but no change in the annual catchment runoff efficiency. In the period between 2002 and 2004, the hydrographs in the drained catchments, while still flashy, were less sensitive to rainfall than in the 1950s and the runoff efficiency had significantly increased. Drains resulted in a distinctive spatial pattern of runoff production across the slopes. Overland flow was significantly lower in the drained catchments where throughflow was more dominant. In the intact peatlands, matrix throughflow produced by peat layers below 10 cm was rare and produced < 1% of the runoff. However, in drained peatlands, matrix throughflow in deeper peat layers was common and provided around 23% of the runoff from gauged plots. Macropore flow, the density of soil piping, and pipeflow were significantly greater in drained peatlands than in intact basins. Gradual changes to peat structure could explain the long-term changes in river flow, which are in addition to those occurring in the immediate aftermath of peatland drainage.

AB Continuous determination of suspended solids (SS) by turbidity measurements in drained peatland is expanding, increasing the demand for reliable calibration data for load calculations. Turbidity was used to estimate SS (n = 333) and particulate nutrient loads (n = 157) after peatland drainage for forestry in Central Finland for three study catchments. SS data from the drainage outlet correlated well with turbidity, demonstrating that turbidity can be used as an accurate measure of SS in drained peatland conditions. Measurement error was found to be approximately 8% (p < 0.01). The proportion of organic and inorganic fractions in SS seemed to affect calibration. Total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and particulate phosphorus showed linear dependency on turbidity values because a fraction of these nutrients occurs in particulate form or adsorbed to organic matter. Regressions during snowmelt periods were markedly different from those in other periods that were related to changes in the dissolved/total nutrient ratio. A close correlation between nutrient content of SS and turbidity provided a novel method to calculate phosphorus load from drained peatland areas, which can be used to conduct nutrient load estimations during summer peak flows.

AB Rewetting of drained peatlands has been recommended to reduce CO2 emissions and to restore the carbon sink function of peatlands. Recently, the combination of rewetting and biomass production (paludiculture) has gained interest as a possible land use option in peatlands for obtaining such benefits of lower CO2 emissions without losing agricultural land. This study quantified the carbon balance (CO2, CH4 and harvested biomass C) of rewetted and drained peat soils under intensively managed reed canary grass (RCG) cultivation. Mesocosms were maintained at five different groundwater levels (GWLs), that is 0, 10, 20cm below the soil surface, representing rewetted peat soils, and 30 and 40cm below the soil surface, representing drained peat soils. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and CH4 emissions was measured during the growing period of RCG (May to September) using transparent and opaque closed chamber methods. The average dry biomass yield was significantly lower from rewetted peat soils (12Mgha(-1)) than drained peat soils (15Mgha(-1)). Also, CO2 fluxes of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) from rewetted peat soils were significantly lower than from drained peat soils, but net uptake of CO2 was higher from rewetted peat soils. Cumulative CH4 emissions were negligible (0.01g CH(4)m(-2)) from drained peat soils but were significantly higher (4.9g CH(4)m(-2)) from rewetted peat soils during measurement period (01 May-15 September 2013). The extrapolated annual C balance was 0.03 and 0.68kg C m(-2) from rewetted and drained peat soils, respectively, indicating that rewetting and paludiculture can reduce the loss of carbon from peatlands.

ID WATER-TABLE LEVELS; DEEP PEAT; GROWTH; SOILS
AB The spatial variability of soil aeration (aerobic limit depth and oxygen diffusion rate (ODR)) among different drainage ditch spacings and at various distances from drainage ditches was examined at two peatlands drained for forestry in north-central Alberta. Drainage lowered mean water table levels (p < 0.001) at both peatlands. Lower water table levels within drained areas were associated with greater aerobic limit depths (p < 0.001) and greater ODR (p < 0.001 at Saulteaux River; p < 0.027 at Wolf Creek) compared with undrained areas of both peatlands. Spatial patterns of aerobic limit depth and ODR indicated strong spatial variability of soil aeration in the immediate vicinity of drainage ditches. However, little sensitivity of soil aeration to different ditch spacings was evident. Potential effects of post-drainage subsidence on soil aeration was evident as increased distance of both the aerobic limit, and near-zero oxygen diffusion rates above the water table surface at both peatlands. One effect of post-drainage peatland subsidence may be to increase the thickness of the capillary zone above the water table. However, reduction of aeration within the rooting zone of peatland trees due to subsidence was not observed because of low water tables within the drained areas of both peatlands.

AB Soil samples from 15 eutrophic, 26 herb-rich, 15 tall-sedge, and 11 low-sedge drained peatland sites were analysed for easily soluble and aluminum, iron, and calcium bound phosphorus (P) using the Chang and Jackson sequential fractionation method. Compared to earlier investigations, where only total and easily soluble P contents (e.g. NH4OAc or dilute H2SO4 extractable P) in peat have been analysed, significantly higher differences between sites were observed. The cutrophic sites were characterized by four to six-fold greater Ca-bound organic P and two to three-fold greater Ca-bound inorganic P contents than on the other three site type groups, whereas the average Al-bound inorganic P content of the eutrophic sites was only one-third of that at the other site types. Substantial differences between sites were also observed for Fe-bound inorganic P, i.e. two to four-fold greater Fe-P contents were measured at the herb-rich sites compared with the other three site type groups. The stand volume growth in the 67 studied drained peatland sites correlated significantly with Al-bound organic P and Fe-bound inorganic and organic P. The study showed that a detailed fractionation and discrimination of different forms of soil P is important in increasing the understanding of the relationship between P availability and vegetation community types and stand growth on drained peatlands.

AB The aim of this study was to determine the effect of drainage on peat properties, porewater chemistry, and peat decomposition proxies in an ombrogenous peatland in the Hudson Bay Lowland (HBL). We anticipated that drainage would change peatland hydrology, vegetation, and biogeochemistry, leading to an increase in peat decomposition. As indicators of peat biogeochemical change and potential proxies for peat decomposition, we compared peat porewater chemistry and in situ nutrient availability of different microforms in a pristine ombrogenous bog, with a bog that has been subject to gradual lowering of the water table by 20 to 80 cm for approximately 7 years prior to, and during, our study. We also examined the chemical composition of peat and peat leachates (organic matter) fromSphagnumand lichen-covered hummocks at each site. Nutrient availability was greater in pools at the drained bog, indicating mineralisation of the dry and bare peat surface. However, our results did not show evidence of significant peat biogeochemical change or advanced decomposition in hummocks at the drained bog, with no difference in nutrient availabilities, peat porewater chemistry, or peat leachate chemistry at the drained and pristine bog. We also found no significant difference in enzyme activity (phenol oxidases) in hummocks at each site, proposed to be an important factor for C loss from peatland ecosystems in drier conditions. Overall, the effects of drainage on peat properties, porewater chemistry, and peat chemical composition at our sites were small and varied for different vegetation-microform types. Although decomposition in drained peatlands is likely constrained by cool temperatures in the HBL, our results suggest that ecohydrological feedbacks at the microform scale may also be important in slowing decomposition in these peatlands.

AB We restored small downstream sections of forestry-drained peatland catchments for use as wetland buffer areas and studied the effects of their restoration on the exports of nitrogen, phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, and dissolved aluminium and iron. Even though the buffer areas were small relative to their catchment areas (0.5-3.5%), buffer restoration clearly increased pollutant exports. Thus, even though restored buffer areas proved later to be efficient in retaining pollutants from their upstream catchment area, turning from an initial restoration-induced pollutant source to their net sink may take a long time. In one restored buffer, the whole concept of restoration to improve water quality was judged questionable due to significantly deteriorated water quality. We presented a hypothesis that high iron content in peat may be a common denominator for the sites with high carbon and organic nutrient exports after restoration of forestry-drained peatlands. We conclude that it may not always be reasonable to restore drained peatlands for use as wetland buffers due to high initial pollution exports.

AB Under the warmer climate, predicted for the future, northern peatlands are expected to become drier. This drying will lower the water table and likely result in reduced emissions of methane (CH4) from these ecosystems. However, the prediction of declining CH4 fluxes does not consider the potential effects of ecological succession, particularly the invasion of sedges into currently wet sites (open water pools, low lawns). The goal of this study was to characterize the relationship between the presence of sedges in peatlands and CH4 efflux under natural conditions and under a climate change simulation (drained peatland). Methane fluxes, gross ecosystem production, and dissolved pore water CH4 concentrations were measured and a vegetation survey was conducted in a natural and drained peatland near St. Charles-de-Bellechasse, Quebec, Canada, in the summer of 2003. Each peatland also had plots where the sedges had been removed by clipping. Sedges were larger, more dominant, and more productive at the drained peatland site. The natural peatland had higher CH4 fluxes than the drained peatland, indicating that drainage was a significant control on CH4 flux. Methane flux was higher from plots with sedges than from plots where sedges had been removed at the natural peatland site, whereas the opposite case was observed at the drained peatland site. These results suggest that CH4 flux was enhanced by sedges at the natural peatland site and attenuated by sedges at the drained peatland site. However, the attenuation of CH4 flux due to sedges at the drained site was reduced in wetter periods. This finding suggests that CH4 flux could be decreased in the event of climate warming due to the greater depth to the water table, and that sedges colonizing these areas could further attenuate CH4 fluxes during dry periods. However, during wet periods, the sedges may cause CH4 fluxes to be higher than is currently predicted for climate change scenarios.

AB Peatland drainage enhances tree growth, changes catchment hydrology and increases export of nutrients and suspended solids to water bodies. In this study, impacts of peatland drainage on the properties of water flow paths in terrestrial parts of catchments were assessed in terms of slope, elevation, length and soil type. Three study catchments (area 31.8-153.5 km(2)) were delineated using a 25m x 25m digital elevation model (DEM). Typical water flow paths were calculated for each catchment to characterize the mean elevation above the receiving water body as a function of distance along water flow paths. The resulting two-dimensional (2D) profile also allowed calculations of horizontally distributed properties of catchments as a function of distance to the water body. Peatland drainage decreased the length and elevation of the typical water flow path, and increased the area near water bodies. Increasing drainage from 10.7% to 55.4% of the total catchment area increased the area residing close to a water body (no farther than 25 m) from 17.1% to 60.7%. This area estimate is useful for assessing the costs of water protection, arising from restricting forestry operations in the vicinity of water bodies.

LA English
DT Article
ID METHYLMERCURY; WATERS
AB The concentration of Hg was studied in runoff from drained and undrained peatlands in the south and central parts of Sweden, from 1987 to 1989.  Mercury was speciated into total Hg, water-soluble Hg (Hg II) including reactive Hg (Hg IIa) and non-reactive Hg (Hg IIb), and methyl Hg.  The aim of the study was to investigate if normally low concentrations of different species of Hg in runoff from peatland were elevated at drained mires with peat-harvesting.  Five drained mires with different nutrient statuses were studied, and compared with undrained controls.  The highest concentration of total Hg (5.3 to 21.3 ng L-1) was found in runoff from an undrained, oligotrophic bog with low pH (3.79 to 4.08).  Mires in south Sweden showed in general higher concentrations of all species of Hg in runoff compared to central Sweden.  The concentrations of total Hg, Hg IIa and Hg IIb in runoff from peatland showed similar levels as runoff from forested areas.  No data showed that the drained peatland leached more total Hg than the undrained areas.
   The determination of Me Hg during one year indicated higher mean concentrations (0.40 to 0.43 ng L-1) in runoff from two drained mires in south Sweden compared to the control in the same area (0.23 ng L-1) and all the studied mires in the central part of Sweden (0.10 to 0.24 ng L-1).  No obvious seasonal patterns or correlations with other determined elements were found, but the highest concentrations of all species of Hg in runoff normally occurred after dry periods with a low ground water table and low or moderate water flow.

AB Fires on drained peatlands arise as a result of lowering of the groundwater table and the rupture of its capillary fringe from the peat soil horizons. Fires destroy the most fertile soils of the nonchernozemic region, adversely affect the diversity and species composition of the biota and the work of transport, and cause diseases and the death of people. A set of preventive measures against fires on the drained peatlands is proposed. It is important to use these soils only for meadow grass cultivation with rotations enriched in perennial grasses. No cases of "black" crop growing are possible on peatlands. The reclamation of peat soils should be implemented only with the bilateral regulation of the water regime. An optimal system of increasing the fertility of drained peat soils should be applied; their use should also be accompanied by sanding.

AB Drainage of peatlands for forestry starts a succession of ground vegetation in which mire species are gradually replaced by forest species. Some mire plant communities vanish quickly following the water-level drawdown; some may prevail longer in the moister patches of peatland. Drainage ditches, as a new kind of surface, introduce another component of spatial variation in drained peatlands. These variations were hypothesized to affect methane (CH(4)) fluxes from drained peatlands. Methane fluxes from different plant communities and unvegetated surfaces, including ditches, were measured at the drained part of Lakkasuo mire, Central Finland. The fluxes were found to be related to peatland site type, plant community, water-table position and soil temperature. At nutrient-rich fen sites fluxes between plant communities differed only a little: almost all plots acted as CH(4) sinks (-0.9 to -0.4 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1)), with the exception of Eriophorum angustifolium Honck. communities, which emitted 0.9 g CH(4) m(-2) stop d(-1). At nutrient-poor bog site the differences between plant communities were clearer. The highest emissions were measured from Eriophorum vaginatum L. communities (29.7 mg CH(4) m(-2) stop d(-1)), with a decreasing trend to Sphagna (10.0 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1)supercript stop) and forest moss communities (2.6 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1)). CH(4) emissions from different kinds of ditches were highly variable, and extremely high emissions (summertime averages 182-600 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1) stop) were measured from continuously water-covered ditches at the drained fen. Variability in the emissions was caused by differences in the origin and movement of water in the ditches, as well as differences in vegetation communities in the ditches. While drainage on average greatly decreases CH(4) emissions from peatlands, a great spatial variability in fluxes is emerged. Emissions from ditches constantly covered with water, may in some cases have a great impact on the overall CH(4) emissions from drained peatlands.

AB Many peatlands were affected by drainage in the past, and restoration of their water regime aims to bring back their original functions. The purpose of our study was to simulate re-wetting of soils of different types of drained peatlands (bogs and minerotrophic mires, located in the Sumava Mountains, Czech Republic) under laboratory conditions (incubation for 15 weeks) and to assess possible risks of peatland water regime restoration - especially nutrient leaching and the potentials for CO2 and CH4 production. After re-wetting of soils sampled from drained peatlands (simulated by anaerobic incubation) (i) phosphorus concentration (SRP) did not change in any soil, (ii) concentration of ammonium and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) increased, but only in a drained fen, (iii) DOC increased significantly in the drained fen and degraded drained bog, (iv) CO2 production decreased, (v) CH4 production and the number of methanogens increased in all soils, and (vi) archaeal methanogenic community composition was also affected by re-wetting: it differed significantly between drained and pristine fens, whereas it was more similar between drained and pristine bogs. Overall, the soils from fens reacted more dynamically to re-wetting than the bogs, and therefore, some nutrients (especially nitrogen) and DOC leaching may be expected from drained fens after their water regime restoration. However, if compared to their state before restoration, ammonium and phosphorus leaching should not increase and leaching of nitrates and DON should even decrease after restoration, especially during the vegetation season. Further, CO2 production in soils of fens and bogs should decrease after their water regime restoration, whereas CH4 production in soils should increase. However, we cannot derive any clear conclusions about CH4 emissions from the ecosystems based on this study, as they depend strongly on environmental factors and on the actual activity of methanotrophs in situ.

AB Eutrophication caused by excess nutrient loads is the main problem for Estonian surface waters. Even after the drastic decrease in the application of mineral fertilizers at the beginning of the 1990s, the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in many rivers remained at undesirable and unexpectedly high levels. The investigation showed that drained peat soils are an important source of nitrogen export to the surface waters. Runoff of nitrogen from drained peat soils is, on average, 1.5-fold higher than from agricultural lands in Estonia.

AB Electrocoagulation (EC) treatment of 100 mg/L synthetic wastewater (SWW) containing humic acids was optimized (achieving 90% CODMn, and 80% DOC removal efficiencies), after which real peat bog drainage waters (PBDWs) from three northern Finnish peat bogs were also treated. High pollutant removal efficiencies were achieved: P-tot, TS, and color could be removed completely, while N-tot, CODMn, and DOC/TOC removal efficiencies were in the range of 33-41%, 75-90%, and 62-75%, respectively. Al and Fe performed similarly as the anode material.
   Large scale experiments (1 m(3)) using cold (T = 10-11 degrees C) PBDWs were also conducted successfully, with optimal treatment times of 60-120 min (applying current densities of 60 -75 A/m(2)). Residual values of Al and Fe (complete removal) were lower than their initial values in the EC-treated PBDWs.
   Electricity consumption and operational costs in optimum conditions were found to be low and similar for all the waters studied: 0.94 kWh/m(3) and 0.15 (sic)/m(3) for SWW and 0.35 -0.70 kWh/m(3) and 0.06-0.12 (sic)/m(3) for the PBDWs (large-scale). Thus, e.g. solar cells could be considered as a power source for this EC application. In conclusion, EC treatment of PBDW containing humic substances was shown to be feasible. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Seasonal and between stream variation (catchment dependent variation) in losses of organic and inorganic carbon via downstream transport and outgassing of CO2 into the atmosphere were studied in 11 small boreal catchments situated in close proximity to each other. Of these catchments four were undrained peatland rich catchments, four drained peatland rich catchments and three managed mineral soil-dominated catchments. Downstream export of total inorganic carbon (TIC) varied between 870 and 1400 kg km(-2) a(-1) and was rather consistent between the catchments, except in the case of the mineral soil-dominated catchment Kangaslampi, where export was only 420 kg km(-2) a(-1). The export of total organic carbon (TOC) varied between 2300 and 14,800 kg km(-2) a(-1) and was highest in peatland rich catchments. Peatland drainage decreased TIC and TOC concentrations in the long term, but did not affect lateral carbon export due to increased runoff from the catchments. Partial pressure of CO2 in streams was the highest in undrained peatland rich catchments, but the outgassing of CO2 into the atmosphere was also high from drained peatlands due to the higher discharge rate and long ditch networks. In mineral soil-dominated catchments both downstream export of carbon and emission into the atmosphere were low. TOC exports were compared in two climatically different years (2003 and 2007). The results indicate that climate change might alter the timing of the TOC export from the catchments, the importance of the spring ice melt diminishing and both snow cover and snow free period export increasing.

AB Worldwide, drainage-based water management is applied to facilitate agricultural use of coastal peatland areas, leading to large-scale peat oxidation and land subsidence. Meanwhile, there is a strong call for a more sustainable use and management of drained peatlands. Drainage severely enhances greenhouse gas emission and land subsidence, which can be counteracted by rewetting. However, this advocated alternative may also induce unwanted processes affecting ecosystem functioning. In this overview we discuss the complex biogeochemical responses related to drainage and rewetting in peatlands and compare the biogeochemical effects of deep drainage to those of rewetting in order to identify the most sustainable management strategy for drained coastal peatlands. Due to drainage, oxidation of the iron sulphide pool leads to a highly underestimated source of sulphate for adjacent surface waters, indirectly enhancing eutrophication. Although rewetting also enhances eutrophication by mobilisation and discharge of phosphorus to surface waters, we propose this effect may be mitigated by co-discharged iron, binding phosphorus. As rewetting is expected to reduce societal costs and maximises ecosystem services of peatlands, we suggest to rewet drained agricultural peatlands wherever feasible. We discuss several promising, more sustainable, land use alternatives for rewetted coastal peatlands.

AB Methodological aspects of studying the organic carbon budget of drained peat bogs used in agriculture are discussed. Difficulties in the assessment of carbon budget on the basis of measured carbon inflows and outflows are shown. The "soil pool" model of the carbon budget is suggested. It is based on the results of long-term experimental studies of a drained peatland in Ukrainian Polesie. An algorithm for calculating the carbon budget in the aerated part of the peatland-the peat soil proper-is developed with due account for a gradual involvement of the deep peat layers into the zone of soil processes. Data on the loss of dry peat mass and organic carbon per in the course of peat mineralization and surface subsidence are given with due account for the nature of the peatland and the duration of its agricultural use.

AB Peatlands have been subject to artificial drainage for centuries. This drainage has been in response to agricultural demand, forestry, horticultural and energy properties of peat and alleviation of flood risk. However, there are several environmental problems associated with drainage of peatlands. This paper describes the nature of these problems and examines the evidence for changes in hydrological and hydrochemical processes associated with these changes. Traditional black-box water balance approaches demonstrate little about wetland dynamics and therefore the science of catchment response to peat drainage is poorly understood. It is crucial that a more process-based approach be adopted within peatland ecosystems. The environmental problems associated with peat drainage have led, in part, to a recent reversal in attitudes to peatlands and we have seen a move towards wetland restoration. However, a detailed understanding of hydrological, hydrochemical and ecological process-interactions will be fundamental if we are to adequately restore degraded peatlands, preserve those that are still intact and understand the impacts of such management actions at the catchment scale.

AB The current understanding, based on previous studies, is that increased discharge nutrient concentrations from boreal peatlands drained for forestry return to similar levels as those of pristine peatlands within about 20 years after their drainage. As an implicit consequence of this finding, it has been assumed that there are no long-term increasing trends in nutrient exports from these peatlands after the establishment of forestry. We analysed discharge total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) concentration data from 54 catchments with undrained pristine peatlands and 34 catchments with drained peatlands using data with considerably longer drainage history than in previous studies. Our results agree with previous studies in that discharge TN and TP concentrations in areas drained 20-30 years ago did not differ much from those in pristine sites. However, we also observed that the TN and TP concentrations were increasing with years since drainage of these catchments. Discharge TN and TP concentrations were over two times higher in areas drained 60 years ago when compared with more recently drained areas. Our results challenge the current perceptions by showing that forestry-drained peatlands may contribute to water eutrophication considerably more than previously estimated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Peatlands play an important role in emissions of the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O, which are produced during mineralization of the peat organic matter. To examine the influence of soil type (fen, bog soil) and environmental factors (temperature, groundwater level), emission of CO2, CH4 and N2O and soil temperature and groundwater level were measured weekly or biweekly in loco over a one-year period at four sites located in Ljubljana Marsh, Slovenia using the static chamber technique. The study involved two fen and two bog soils differing in organic carbon and nitrogen content, pH, bulk density, water holding capacity and groundwater level. The lowest CO2 fluxes occurred during the winter, fluxes of N2O were highest during summer and early spring (February, March) and fluxes of CH4 were highest during autumn. The temporal variation in CO2 fluxes could be explained by seasonal temperature variations, whereas CH4 and N2O fluxes could be correlated to groundwater level and soil carbon content. The experimental sites were net sources of measured greenhouse gases except for the drained bog site, which was a net sink of CH4. The mean fluxes of CO2 ranged between 139 mg m(-2) h(-1) in the undrained bog and 206 mg m(-2) h-(1) in the drained fen; mean fluxes of CH4 were between -0.04 mg m(-2) h(-1) in the drained bog and 0.05 mg m(-2) h(-1) in the drained fen; and mean fluxes of N2O were between 0.43 mg m(-2) h(-1) in the drained fen and 1.03 mg m(-2) h(-1) in the drained bog. These results indicate that the examined peatlands emit similar amounts of CO2 and CH4 to peatlands in Central and Northern Europe and significantly higher amounts of N2O. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Peatland drainage has been an important component of forestry management in the boreal zone and the resulting ditch networks are maintained regularly to sustain forest productivity. In Finland, this is recognized as the most detrimental forestry practice increasing diffuse loads of suspended solids. Alongside forestry management on peatlands, interest in peatland restoration has grown lately. Distributed hydrological modeling has the potential to address these matters by recognizing relevant physical mechanisms and identifying most suitable strategies for mitigating undesired outcomes. This study investigates the utility of such a modeling approach in a drained peatland forest environment. To provide a suitable tool for this purpose, we coupled channel network flow to the three-dimensional distributed hydrological model FLUSH. The resulting model was applied to a 5.2 ha drained peatland forest catchment in Eastern Finland. The model was calibrated and validated using field measurements obtained over frost-free periods of five months. The application showed that distributed modeling can disentangle the importance of spatial factors on local soil moisture conditions, which is significant as peatland drainage aims to control these conditions. In our application, we limited the spatial aspect to the topography and the drainage network, and found that the drainage configuration had a clear effect on the spatial soil moisture patterns but that the effect was less pronounced during the wetter summer. Future applications of distributed modeling in this field comprises investigating the impacts of other spatial factors, modeling channel erosion and solid transport to address strategies for their mitigation, and evaluating restoration schemes.

AB In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in artificial drain-blocking in world peatlands. The UK blanket peatlands have been severely drained over the past few decades but now drains are being blocked in an attempt to improve peatland environments. The drain-blocking has been a disparate process with limited knowledge transfer between organisations and within organisations operating in different geographic areas. Consequently, there has been no compilation of techniques used and their effectiveness. During this study thirty-two drain-blocked sites were surveyed and all the key stake-holders interviewed. Drain-blocking using peat turf was preferred by practitioners and was also the most cost-effective method. Peat turves were successful except on steep slopes, in areas of severe erosion, in very wet or very dry locations, or if the mineral substrate was exposed. A drain-blocking best practice guide is offered by this paper, providing information on the most suitable methods for blocking peatland drains under different circumstances. Additional considerations are provided for practitioners to ensure peatland drain-blocking is as successful as possible. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Forestry drainage is a method used extensively to grow timber in peat soils in Finland. Following drainage, the developing tree stand influences methane (CH,) emissions by altering plant and microbial communities through water-level drawdown, competition for nutrients and shading. Therefore there should be a close correlation between tree stand volume and CH4 fluxes in drained peatlands. We used previously published material along with data collected in this research programme to assess the potential of tree stand volume as a tool for estimating CH4 fluxes for drained peatland forests, and to quantify this relationship under conditions prevailing in Finland. There was a clear negative exponential relationship between tree stand volumes and CH 4 emissions. Sites with small stand volume emitted CH4 after drainage (up to 4 9 CH4 m(-2) a(-1)), while larger stands consumed it (up to 1 g CH4 m (-2) a(-1)); the turning point from source to sink was about 140 m(3) ha(-1). Similar relationships were also found for undrained mires, although not as clearly as for the drained sites. Since drained peatland forests in Finland are generally rather young in drainage age and small in stand volumes, they are still estimated to emit CH 4 to the atmosphere, although the rate has substantially decreased after drainage.

AB An imbalanced nutrient status in Scots pine stands on drained mires is primarily a consequence of excess nitrogen (N) in relation to mineral nutrients such as phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). In this study, the variation of foliar N, P, and K concentrations relative to some site and environmental characteristics was examined. Foliar nutrient concentrations were determined on needle samples collected from mires representing different drainage ages, site types, geographical locations and annual weather conditions. In the overall data (n = 971 samples in 333 stands) the foliar N concentration varied between 6.7 and 24.2 mg g(-1), the P concentration between 0.83 and 2.32 mg g(-1), and the K concentration between 2.22 and 6.23 mg g(-1). The original (pre-drainage) mire site type proved to be an important factor in explaining the nutrient status of the trees: on originally forested sites, the nutrient balance (N versus K; N versus P) was mostly adequate, whereas on sparsely forested and treeless sites, K deficiency was common. N deficiency was the most common in forested 'nitrogen-poor' sites, while P and K deficiencies were more common in originally treeless or sparsely forested 'nitrogen rich' sites, where the nutrient imbalance was also the greatest. Over the whole data, 29% of the cases were diagnosed to be N-deficient, 51% P-deficient, and 25% K-deficient. The foliar N concentration increased with increasing temperature sum. The foliar K concentration decreased with increasing depth of the peat layer. On former treeless or sparsely forested sites, foliar K decreased slightly with increasing drainage age. In contrast, on thin-peated sites the foliar P concentration increased with increasing drainage age. The climate conditions (location), the original site type of the mire and peat thickness should be taken into account when planning silvicultural measures on mires drained for forestry.

AB Esker aquifers are common groundwater bodies in Europe. Management of these aquifers should take account of the sustainability of groundwater-dependent ecosystems and land use in an integrated way. An unconfined esker aquifer in northern Finland was modelled with MODFLOW to determine how groundwater resources are impacted by the surrounding peatland drainage scheme and to simulate scenarios for possible drainage restoration. The impacts of groundwater abstraction and climate change were also simulated. A calibration-constrained Monte Carlo method was used to provide information on the uncertainties associated with model predictions. The results suggest that peatland drainage in the vicinity of eskers can have a significant role in lowering the water table, even though climate variability may mask these impacts. Drainage restoration by filling the ditches might have positive impacts on the aquifer water levels. Comparison of water-table changes caused by peatland drainage with the changes brought by water abstraction and climate variability helped to quantify impacts of different land-use scenarios and facilitated discussion with the local stakeholders. Based on this study, more attention should be devoted to peatland drainage schemes in integrated groundwater management of esker aquifers.

AB Drier conditions caused by drainage for infrastructure development, or associated with global climate warming, may test the resilience of carbon-rich northern peatlands. Feedbacks among biological and hydrological processes maintain the long-term stability of peatlands, but if hydrological thresholds are passed, these feedbacks may be weakened, causing a shift in ecosystem state and potentially large losses of carbon (C). To determine peatland response to hydrological change, we examined the structure (vegetation composition and hydrology) and biogeochemical function (carbon dioxide exchange) of a pristine bog and a bog subject to similar to 7 years localised drainage (caused by regional groundwater drawdown due to mine dewatering) in the Hudson Bay Lowland, Canada. Water tables at the drained bog were similar to 1mbelow the hummock surface at the time of study compared to similar to 0.3mat the pristine bog. For hummocks and intermediate microforms at the drained bog, plant production was significantly less than at the pristine bog, most likely due to small changes in vegetation structure (reduced Sphagnum cover and smaller shrub leaf:stem ratios) caused by deeper water tables and significantly reduced moisture content of surface peat. Despite these changes in vegetation and hydrology, net ecosystem production (NEP) remained positive (C sink) for these microforms at the drained bog. Dry pools with mostly bare peat at the drained bog had negative NEP (C source to atmosphere), in stark contrast to Sphagnum- and sedge-dominated pools at the pristine bog with small but positive NEP. Our study shows that dry pools now occupy an unstable state, but the hydrological thresholds for a shift in ecosystem state have not yet been reached for hummocks and intermediate microforms at the drained bog. However, weak or no relationships between water table depth, peat surface moisture content, and plant production for these microforms at the drained bog, suggest that drainage has weakened the hydrological feedbacks regulating peat production, causing peat accumulation to slow. If drier conditions prevail, this reduced resilience increases the potential for a shift in ecosystem state and raises the risk of large C loss due to continued decomposition of deeper peat in oxic conditions, and wildfire.

AB To study the impact of forestry drainage on peat carbon storage, we cored paired quantitative peat samples from undrained and drained sides of an eccentric bog. Five pairs of 0 to <= 100-cm-deep surface-peat cores, and a pair of profiles representing the full peat deposit provided stratigraphic evidence of marked loss of surface peat due to drainage. For the drained side cores, we found a relative subsidence of 25-37 cm of the surface, and a loss of about 10 kg(DW) m(-2), corresponding to 131 +/- 28 g C m(-2) a(-1) (mean +/- SE) for the post-drainage period Similar peat loss was also found in the full deposit profiles, thus lending credibility to the whole-column inventory approach, even though the decrease (9 kg(DW) m(-2)) was relatively small in comparison with the total carbon storage (233 and 224 kg(DW) m(-2) for the undrained and drained sides, respectively).

AB Peatlands represent an important reservoir of carbon, but their functioning can be threatened by water level drawdown caused by climate or land use change. Knowledge of how microbial communities respond to long-term drainage in different peatland types could help improve predictions of the effect of climate change on these ecosystems. We investigated the effect of long-term drainage on microbial community composition in bog, fen and spruce swamp forests (SSF) in the Sumava Mountains (Czech Republic), using high-throughput barcoded sequencing, in relation to peat biochemical properties. Longterm drainage had substantial effects, which depended strongly on peatland type, on peat biochemical properties and microbial community composition. The effect of drainage was most apparent on fen, followed by SSF, and lowest on bog. Long-term drainage led to lower pH, reduced peat decomposability and increased bulk density, which was reflected by reduced microbial activity. Bacterial diversity decreased and Acidobacteria became the dominant phylum on drained sites, reflecting a convergence in bacterial community composition across peatlands after long-term drainage. The archaeal communities changed very strongly and became similar across drained peatlands. Overall, the characteristic differences between distinct peatland types under natural conditions were diminished by long-term drainage. Bog represented a relatively resilient system while fen seemed to be very sensitive to environmental changes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Multivariate analysis unambiguously demonstrated the differentiation of oxidoreductase activity (catalase, peroxidase, and dehydrogenase) in peat soils after a 20-25-year period of bog drainage and afforestation. The enzyme activity depended on the drainage depth. A statistical model has been developed to predict the degree of humification of peat organic matter from peroxidase activity and moisture of drained soils. Soil peroxidase activity can be an important indicator of the degree of biochemical transformation of drained and forested bogs.

AB Peatlands occupy about 4% of Poland's area and perform important environmental and economic functions, including agricultural ones. In the last century, the majority of fen peatlands were drained for agricultural use. Drainage reduced the water retention of peat and initiated changes in their physical and water properties. In order to determine the rate and extent of changes in these properties, in the following years 1987, 2007 and 2018, studies were carried out within the Suprasl Dolna fen peatland, NE Poland, in two prognostic soil-moisture complexes: moist (PSMC-B) and dry (PSMC-C). Studies have shown that in the PSMC-B complex, the water table depth decreased to a maximum of 100 cm below ground level, while on the PSMC-C complex, the ground water decreased even to 150 cm below ground level. In the PSMC-B complex, peat mineralisation and physical-water properties changed to a small extent during the research period (statistically insignificant). In the PSMC-C habitat, the subsidence of peatland surface was observed (11 cm), bulk density increased, whereas the total porosity and full water capacity decreased. Deterioration in physical and water properties caused gradual degradation of drained fen peatland soils and their evolution towards organo-mineral soils. In order to slow down or even stop degradation processes in shallow and medium deep peat-mursh soils, there is a need to stop and regulate the outflow of water using efficient drainage facilities, as well as to carry out technical restoration works.

AB In a species-rich poor fen (Caricetum nigrae) and a species-poor drained fen, the difference in nutrient limitation of the vegetation was assessed in a full-factorial fertilization experiment with N, P and K. The results were compared to the nutrient ratios of plant material and to chemical analysis of the topsoil. A rewetting experiment with intact sods was carried out in the glasshouse and the results are discussed in view of restoration prospects of drained and degraded peatlands. In the undrained poor fen the above-ground biomass yield was N-limited while the vegetation of the drained fen was K-limited. Experimental rewetting of intact turf samples, taken in the drained site, did not change the biomass yield or the type of nutrient limitation. It was concluded that mire systems which have been subjected to prolonged drainage are inclined to pronounced K-deficiency, probably due to washing out of potassium and harvesting the standing crop. This may hamper restoration projects in degraded peat areas where nature conservation tries to restore species-rich vegetation types with a high nature value.

AB The effect of the water table on nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from pear profiles representing boreal peatlands of differing nutrient status was studied in the laboratory. Lowering of the water table in peat monoliths taken from two natural waterlogged peatlands for 14 weeks in a greenhouse at 20 degrees C increased the fluxes of N2O, an effect that was enhanced further by incubation in the dark. Raising of the water table in monoliths from two drained and forested peatlands caused cessation of the N2O fluxes from the drained peats, which had previously been sources of N2O. It is known that N2O fluxes have increased in peatlands drained several decades ago. The results suggest that it is not necessary for the water table to be lowered for several years to change a boreal peatland from a N2O sink to a source of the gas. In addition to the draining of peatlands, climate change can be expected to lower ground water levels during the summertime in the boreal zone, and this could cause marked changes in N2O fluxes from boreal peatlands by enhancing the microbial processes involved in nitrogen transformations.

AB We examined the effects of long-term (51 years) drainage on peat microbial communities using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. We analysed the peat profiles of natural and adjacent drained fen and bog sites. Viable microbes (i.e. microbial PLFA) were present in relatively large amounts even in the deepest peat layers of both peatland sites, a finding that warrants further investigation. Microbial biomass was generally higher in the fen than in the bog. Microbial community structure (indexed from PLFA) differed between the fen and bog sites and among depths. Although we did not exclude other factors, the effect of drainage on the total microbial biomass and community structure was not limited to the surface layers, but extended to the deepest layers of the fen and bog. Long-term drainage increased the total microbial PLFA biomass in the surface, subsurface and bottom layers of the fen, but decreased it in the surface and bottom layers of the bog site. Drainage also increased the characteristic FAs of Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria in the surface and subsurface layers of the fen, and decreased them in the bottom layers of the bog site. The characteristic fungal FA was only reduced in the surface layers of the bog site by drainage. Thus, by affecting the microbial community beyond the surface layers, longterm peatland water -level draw -down can alter the microbial contribution to deeper peat organic matter stabilization. This suggests that long-term drainage may have a more significant climate change effect than revealed by the surface layer analyses alone. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The draining of the English Fens was one of the largest and most expensive agricultural improvement projects undertaken in early-modem England. Though the principal motivation was to make money from the improved land, many advocates of fen drainage emphasized the moral, utopian dimension of such projects, part of a much broader program for improvement and reform of all kinds to benefit the English Commonwealth. To those interested in pursuing good husbandry and agricultural improvement for their own sake, the Fens represented an unparalleled opportunity, a region of great potential yet unrealized. This article examines several texts advocating fen drainage written between 1580 and 1660, especially those published by Samuel Hartlib and his extensive network of correspondents, with particular attention to the non-financial reasons they gave for undertaking such projects.

AB The agricultural use of peatlands, the stabilization of the substrate for building or road construction or for increasing the capacity of soil to support heavy machinery for industrial activities (peat and petroleum extraction), harvesting to provide peat for energy, and the growing media and initiation of chemical processes must be preceded by drainage. As a consequence of drainage, peat underwent an irreversible conversion into moorsh (secondary transformation of the peat). The object of the study was to investigate comparatively the organic matter composition and molecular structure of humic acids (HAs) in the raised bog, fen, and peat-moorsh soils developed in various compositions of botanical cover, peat-forming species, and oxic and anoxic conditions as a result of the oscillation of ground water during drainage as well as to evaluate the vulnerability of soil organic matter (SOM) to decomposition. Drainage was shown to be the principal factor causing the various chemical compositions and physicochemical properties of HAs. Large and significant differences in chemical composition of peat and the properties of HAs were found to be related to the degree of decomposition. The HAs from drained peatlands were less chemically mature. In contrast, the HAs from fen and raised bog were found to be more mature than that of the corresponding drained peatlands. The above findings showed the distinguishable structure of HAs within the soil profile created by the plant residue biodegradation and formed in both oxic and anoxic conditions. The analytical methods of thermal analysis together with the optical densities and paramagnetic behaviour are suitable and effective tools for studying structure-property relationships characterizing the origin and formation process of HAs in various environmental conditions.

AB A 2-yr field trial was conducted on a drained pine bog to measure the dissolution of five phosphorus (P) fertilizers of differing solubility. The rate of fertilizer dissolution was measured using a sequential fractionation which involved pre-extraction with 0.5 M NaCl/TEA followed by I M NaOH and a mixed acid (HNO3 + HCl + H2SO4) digestion. About 56% of Siilinjarvi apatite, a hard magmatic rock phosphate, dissolved over the 2 yrs. For a commercial P+K fertilizer manufactured from Siilinjarvi apatite and KCI (water-soluble P < 0.1%), the corresponding value was 44%. For Moroccan phosphate rock, and a commercial fertilizer manufactured from Moroccan phosphate rock and KCl (water-soluble P = 15.8%), the dissolution was about 44% and 58%, respectively. For superphosphate (water-soluble P = 79%), the corresponding value was 93%.

AB Water table level control by drainage improves forested peatland sites for tree growth, but can also result in subsidence of the peatland surface. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of changes to peat bulk density associated with postdrainage subsidence on peat hydrologic properties at a peatland drained for forestry in north-central Alberta, Canada. Feat hydrologic functions were deter mined by inverse techniques developed for multistep outflow experiments (MULSTP). Se, cn years after drainage, mean peat bulk density (0-40-cm depth) was 63% greater and mean soil water retention (-5 to -15000 cm pressure head) was 66% greater than pear from the nearby undrained control area. Subsidence after drainage was associated with loss of pores >600-mu m diam. with concurrent increases in 3- to 30-mm-diam. pore-size classes, Mean saturated hydraulic conductivity was 1.69 and 14.46 cm h(-1), while mean unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (-5 to -15 000 rm pressure head) was 0.014 and 0.001 cm h(-1) in peat from drained and undrained areas, respectively. Changes in water transport characteristics and in the pool of "plant-available" soil water will probably be beneficial to tree growth in the drained area.

AB Northern peatlands accumulate atmospheric CO2 thus counteracting climate warming. However, CH4 which is more efficient as a greenhouse gas than CO2, is produced in the anaerobic decomposition processes in pear. When peatlands are taken for forestry their water table is lowered by ditching. We studied long-term effects of lowered water table on the development of vegetation and the annual emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O in an ombrotrophic bog and in a minerotrophic fen in Finland. Reclamation of the pear sites for forestry had changed the composition and coverage of the field and ground layer species, and increased highly the growth of tree stand at the drained fen. In general, drainage increased the annual CO2 emissions but the emissions were also affected by the natural fluctuations of water table. In contrast to CO2, drainage had decreased the emissions of CH4, the drained fen even consumed atmospheric CH4. CO2 and CH4 emissions were higher in the virgin fen than in the virgin bog. There were no N2O emissions from neither type of virgin sites. Drainage had, however, highly increased the N2O emissions from the fen. The results suggest that post-drainage changes in gas fluxes depend on the trophy of the original mires.

AB Climate change is considered to alter the functioning of boreal peatland ecosystems, but the vulnerability of pristine, rewetted and drained peatlands to climate change in temperate regions is unknown. We measured carbon (C) gas exchange during wet (2009) and dry (2010) growing periods in pristine, drained and rewetted sites in mountain bogs in the Bohemian Forest (Czech Republic). Wetter lawns with sedges and drier habitats dominated by ericaceous shrubs were distinguished and studied at each site.
   Methane (CH4) emissions, which decreased in the order pristine > rewetted > drained, were generally lower during the 2010 growing period than in 2009 as a consequence of a drought. During the drought in 2010, photosynthesis (P-G) in the drier habitats with shrub vegetation increased on pristine and rewetted sites, while total respiration (R-ECO) remained the same. Communities dominated by sedges maintained similar rates of P-G and R-ECO during both growing periods. Generally, this led to higher C accumulation during the drought on pristine and rewetted bogs. At the drained bog site, the decreased water table (WT) during the drought led to increased P-G and R-ECO, such that the net C accumulation was similar in the two years.
   Drained peatlands may be more threatened by future climate change than pristine or rewetted peatlands because of their limited buffering capacity for decreased WT. In the case of further decreases in WT, they could lose the peatland vegetation and functions that have partly persisted through decades of drainage.

AB This study summarizes the present knowledge of Finnish peatland areas and carbon (C) storage in peat from 1950 to 2000. In 1950, approximately 8.8 million ha of the Finnish peatland area was still undisturbed and 1.4 million ha drained. In 2000, almost 55% (5.7 million ha) of the peatland area in Finland was drained for forestry, 38.4% (4.0 million ha) was undrained, 0.8% (85 000 ha) was in agriculture, 0.6% (60 000 ha) was under water reservoirs, 0.3% (35 000 ha) was under roads and 0.6% was in peat harvesting or had been removed from the harvesting business (63 000 ha). The change in mire area is considered relatively reliable, whereas the net changes in the actual C sequestration and the actual C storage change from 1950 to 2000 involves much more uncertainty. In 2000, the total C storage of Finnish peatland ecosystems was estimated at 5960 Tg, which includes 5304 Tg as peat. Since 1950, the C sequestration of undrained and drained peatlands (peat, plant biomass) basically compensated for the anthropogenic losses. The most important forms of anthropogenic C losses have occurred from agricultural peat soils, water reservoirs, harvested peat and DOC output from forestry drained peatlands. From 1950 to 2000, the total C storage of Finnish peatlands, which includes peat and living plant biomass, was estimated to increased by 52 Tg because the intensive peatland drainage significantly increased the total C storage of vegetation. However, the actual C storage in peat decreased by about 73 Tg. The well-defined changes include the decrease of mire diversity because of forestry drainage.

AB Background: Although forest floor forms a large biomass pool in forested peatlands, little is known about its role in ecosystem carbon (C) dynamics.
   Aim: We aimed to quantify forest floor photosynthesis (P-FF) and respiration (R-FF) as a part of overall C dynamics in a drained peatland forest in southern Finland.
   Methods: We measured net forest floor CO2 exchange with closed chambers and reconstructed seasonal CO2 exchange in the prevailing plant communities.
   Results: The vegetation was a mosaic of plant communities that differed in CO2 exchange dynamics. The reconstructed growing season P-FF was highest in the Sphagnum community and lowest in the feather moss communities. On the contrary, R-FF was highest in the feather moss communities and lowest in the Sphagnum community. CO2 assimilated by the forest floor was 20-30% of the total CO2 assimilated by the forest. The forest floor was a net CO2 source to the atmosphere, because respiration from ground vegetation, tree roots and decomposition of soil organic matter exceeded the photosynthesis of ground vegetation.
   Conclusions: Tree stand dominates C fluxes in drained peatland forests. However, forest floor vegetation can have a noticeable role in the C cycle of peatlands drained for forestry. Similarly to natural mires, Sphagnum moss-dominated communities were the most efficient assimilators of C.

AB The effects of peat total N on the dissolved N and C concentrations and microbial biomass and activity and their range of seasonal fluctuation were studied in a drained peatland forest in Finland. Seasonal fluctuations in the concentrations of extractable dissolved organic (DON) and inorganic nitrogen (DIN) compounds and extractable dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial C and N, ergosterol, net and gross N mineralisation rates were investigated during two growing seasons along a natural peat N gradient in a drained peatland. Significant seasonal fluctuations in NH4+ and DOC concentrations, microbial C and N, but not in ergosterol or microbial C-to-N ratios in the peat, were observed during the 1999 and 2000 growing seasons. The peat total N concentration affected extractable DON and DOC, but not DIN concentrations in the peat. A negative correlation was found between total N concentration in peat and microbial N and C, and a positive correlation between total N and ergosterol, in peat with N concentrations of up to 2%. Gross mineralisation rates did not show any correlation, whereas net mineralisation rates showed a significant positive correlation with the total N concentration of the peat in both 1999 and 2000.

AB Background: Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle. They provide important ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and storage. Drainage disturbs peatland ecosystem services. Mapping drains is difficult and expensive and their spatial extent is, in many cases, unknown. An object based image analysis (OBIA) was performed on a very high resolution satellite image (Geoeye-1) to extract information about drain location and extent on a blanket peatland in Ireland. Two accuracy assessment methods: Error matrix and the completeness, correctness and quality (CCQ) were used to assess the extracted data across the peatland and at several sub sites. The cost of the OBIA method was compared with manual digitisation and field survey. The drain maps were also used to assess the costs relating to blocking drains vs. a business-as-usual scenario and estimating the impact of each on carbon fluxes at the study site.
   Results: The OBIA method performed well at almost all sites. Almost 500 km of drains were detected within the peatland. In the error matrix method, overall accuracy (OA) of detecting the drains was 94% and the kappa statistic was 0.66. The OA for all sub-areas, except one, was 95-97%. The CCQ was 85%, 85% and 71% respectively. The OBIA method was the most cost effective way to map peatland drains and was at least 55% cheaper than either field survey or manual digitisation, respectively. The extracted drain maps were used constrain the study area CO(2 )flux which was 19% smaller than the prescribed Peatland Code value for drained peatlands.
   Conclusions: The OBIA method used in this study showed that it is possible to accurately extract maps of fine scale peatland drains over large areas in a cost effective manner. The development of methods to map the spatial extent of drains is important as they play a critical role in peatland carbon dynamics. The objective of this study was to extract data on the spatial extent of drains on a blanket bog in the west of Ireland. The results show that information on drain extent and location can be extracted from high resolution imagery and mapped with a high degree of accuracy. Under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol Annex 1 parties can account for greenhouse gas emission by sources and removals by sinks resulting from "wetlands drainage and rewetting". The ability to map the spatial extent, density and location of peatlands drains means that Annex 1 parties can develop strategies for drain blocking to aid reduction of CO2 emissions, DOC runoff and water discoloration. This paper highlights some uncertainty around using one-size-fits-all emission factors for GHG in drained peatlands and re-wetting scenarios. However, the OBIA method is robust and accurate and could be used to assess the extent of drains in peatlands across the globe aiding the refinement of peatland carbon dynamics.

AB Overall area of fens occupies 143.6 thousand hectares in Lithuania, including 79.3 thousand ha or 55.2% of drained fens. The influence of drainage on undergrowth formation regularities was studied in meso-eutrophic and eutrophic fens of the Panevezys and Birzai forests using transects, from 100 to 300 m long, perpendicular to the ditch axes or to the longest edge of the fen. Sixty-one water wells were dug along each transect for ground water level measurements. The same number of sampling plots (10 x 10 m) was delineated for investigating the forest vegetation. Furthermore, data from all forest enterprises of Lithuania (34,855 plots) on the species composition of the undergrowth in drained and undrained forest fens were analysed. Results from this analysis indicated that intensive drainage of fens (i.e. lowering of the level of ground water table (H(V.1)) up to 40 cm and more) increased the number of european ash seedlings and decreased the number of black alder, downy birch and partially Norway spruce seedlings. The highest number of spruce seedlings was found in extensively drained fens (H(V.1) = 11-30 cm) characterized by forest stands with average (0.7) and lower stocking level.
   Results from our sampling design indicated that drainage in mature birch stands on meso-eutrophic fens and in black alder stands on meso-eutrophic and eutrophic fens increased undergrowth densities as well as the areas of stands with second tree layers. Moreover, stands with dense undergrowth (3,000 trees ha(-1) and more) expanded from 3.2 to 4.0%. However, the undergrowth density under mature spruce stands on drained meso-eutrophic fens decreased by 255 +/- 39 trees ha(-1) (p < 0.05). It was attributed to the fact that the stocking level of drained spruce stands was higher and that the undergrowth was shaded more considerably in comparison to undrained spruce stands. Draining of birch and black alder stands had essentially changed species composition of their undergrowth. For instance, the proportion of spruce in undergrowth decreased from 10.6 to 35.6% (p < 0.05) while that of ash increased from 10.6 to 41.5% (p < 0.05). Moreover, a tendency of a decrease in the proportion of black alder was observed in the undergrowth of drained fens. Lowering the ground water level due to drainage had led to an increased number of ash seedlings (up to 3000-4400 trees ha(-1)) and weakened natural regeneration of black alder.

AB The need to regenerate peatland forests is expected to increase in the near future in Finland due to harvest of large amounts of peatlands drained during the 1950s and 1960s. In anticipation of this, a new type of excavator-mounted rototiller for soil scarification in peatlands has been developed in Finland to improve the moisture conditions of the seedbed by mixing the ground vegetation, raw humus layer, and peat. The regeneration result of the new rototiller was compared with traditional patch scarification (i.e. scalping) in direct seeding of Scots pine in three forestry-drained peatland sites in eastern Finland. After two growing seasons, rototilling offered no advantage over scalping in terms of the number of established seedlings, probability of empty patches, or seedling height. Seedling establishment was on average higher on scalping (10%) than on rototilling (8%). The main problem in rototilling may have been the loose and porous structure of the seedbed resulting in drought and frost damages.

TI Prompt rewetting of drained peatlands reduces climate warming despite
   methane emissions
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID SINK
AB Peatlands are strategic areas for climate change mitigation because of their matchless carbon stocks. Drained peatlands release this carbon to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2). Peatland rewetting effectively stops these CO2 emissions, but also re-establishes the emission of methane (CH4). Essentially, management must choose between CO2 emissions from drained, or CH4 emissions from rewetted, peatland. This choice must consider radiative effects and atmospheric lifetimes of both gases, with CO2 being a weak but persistent, and CH4 a strong but short-lived, greenhouse gas. The resulting climatic effects are, thus, strongly time-dependent. We used a radiative forcing model to compare forcing dynamics of global scenarios for future peatland management using areal data from the Global Peatland Database. Our results show that CH4 radiative forcing does not undermine the climate change mitigation potential of peatland rewetting. Instead, postponing rewetting increases the long-term warming effect through continued CO2 emissions. Drained peatlands are sources of CO2, and though rewetting could curb emissions, this strategy results in elevated methane release. Here, the authors model peatland emissions scenarios and show that rewetting is a critical way to mitigate climate change despite potential methane increases.

TI The impact of peatland drain-blocking on dissolved organic carbon loss
   and discolouration of water; results from a national survey

AB Peatlands are important terrestrial carbon stores but their environmental degradation has led to concerns of increased carbon loss. Many peatlands have been drained using open ditches and this practice has been associated with enhanced dissolved organic carbon loss and water discolouration. Recent peatland restoration schemes have therefore included the blocking of peatland drains as a strategy for environmental improvement. However, it is not clear whether drain-blocking consistently reduces dissolved organic carbon loads and water discolouration because many peats undergo significant physical and chemical change when they are disturbed. Previous studies investigating the impact of drain-blocking on water colour and dissolved organic carbon have been restricted to a limited spatial and temporal research framework. This study combines an extensive UK-wide survey of blocked and unblocked drains across 32 study sites and intensive monitoring of a peat drain system that has been blocked for 7 years. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations and water discolouration were significantly lower in blocked drains: the mean dissolved organic carbon concentration of water sampled from blocked drains was 28% less than that sampled from unblocked drains. However, this pattern was not consistent at all sites. At the intensive monitoring site no significant differences could be observed in total dissolved organic carbon flux from the fully instrumented blocked and unblocked drains: the blocked drain exported 31,592 kg km(-2) yr(-1) and the unblocked drain 30,123 kg km(-2) yr(-1). Results from bi-weekly grab samples from other drains at the intensively monitored site, however, did conform to the general national pattern of lower dissolved organic carbon and discolouration in blocked drains. The results demonstrate that drain-blocking can be an effective management strategy for reducing DOC loss and water discolouration in disturbed peat catchments. The caveat remains, however, that there will be a number of sites where no significant change will occur. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB CO2 and CH4 fluxes during the winter were measured at natural and drained bog and fen sites in eastern Finland using both the dosed chamber method and calculations of gets diffusion along a concentration gradient through the snowpack. The snow diffusion results were compared with those obtained by chamber, but the winter flux estimates were derived from chamber data only. CH4 emissions from a poor bog were lower than those from an oligotrophic fen, while both CO2 and CH4 fluxes were higher in the Carer rostrata-occupied marginal (lagg) area of the fen than in the slightly less fertile centre. Average estimated winter CO2-C losses from virgin and drained forested peatlands were 41 and 68 g CO2-C m(-2) respectively, accounting for 23 and 21% of the annual total CO2 release from the peat. The mean release of CH4-C was 1.0 g in natural bogs and 3.4 g m-2 in fens, giving rise to winter emissions averaging to 22% of the annual emission from the bogs and 10% of that from the fens. These wintertime carbon gas losses in Finnish natural peatlands were even greater than reported average long-term annual C accumulation values (less than 25 g C m(-2)) The narrow range of 10-30% of the proportion of winter CO2 and CH4 emissions from annual emissions found in Finnish peatlands suggest that a wider generalization in the boreal zone is possible. Drained forested bogs emitted 0.3 g CH2-C m(-2) on the average, while the effectively drained fens consumed an average of 0.01 g CH4-C m(-2). Reason for the low CH4 efflux or net oxidation in drained peatlands probably lies in low substrate supply and thus low CH4 production in the anoxic deep peat layers. N2O release from a fertilized grassland site in November-May was 0.7 g N2O m(-2), accounting for 38% of the total annual emission, while a forested bog released none and two efficiently drained forested fens 0.09 (28% of annual release) and 0.04 g N2O m(-2) (27%) during the winter, respectively.

AB Drainage of peatlands is expected to turn these ecosystems into carbon sources to the atmosphere. We measured carbon dynamics of a drained forested peatland in southern Finland over 4 years, including one with severe drought during growing season. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) was measured with the eddy covariance method from a mast above the forest. Soil and forest floor CO2 and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured from the strips and from ditches with closed chambers. Biomass and litter production were sampled, and soil subsidence was measured by repeated levellings of the soil surface. The drained peatland ecosystem was a strong sink of carbon dioxide in all studied years. Soil CO2 balance was estimated by subtracting the carbon sink of the growing tree stand from NEE, and it showed that the soil itself was a carbon sink as well. A drought period in one summer significantly decreased the sink through decreased gross primary production. Drought also decreased ecosystem respiration. The site was a small sink for CH4, even when emissions from ditches were taken into account. Despite the continuous carbon sink, peat surface subsided slightly during the 10-year measurement period, which was probably mainly due to compaction of peat. It is concluded that even 50 years after drainage this peatland site acted as a soil C sink due to relatively small changes in the water table and in plant community structure compared to similar undrained sites, and the significantly increased tree stand growth and litter production. Although the site is currently a soil C sink, simulation studies with process models are needed to test whether such sites could remain C sinks when managed for forestry over several tree-stand rotations.

AB 1. Multivariate analysis of vegetation and water beetles recorded in the abandoned drains and flooded workings of a cut-over lowland Irish raised bog, Montiaghs Moss, shows that water depth and trophic status are key predictors of plant species composition and that vegetation community structure significantly explains water beetle composition.
   2. The spatial distribution of secondary and tertiary drains and peat pits influences species composition indirectly, through trophic status, by connecting habitats with primary agricultural drains passing through the bog.
   3. Habitat isolation and the cessation of drain management promote change in the submerged aquatic vegetation, emergent-swamp and poor-fen habitats recorded by facilitating vegetation development and surface acidification.
   4. The ecological consequences are likely to be a reduction in the area of open-water habitats, the development of poor-fen vegetation and the subsequent loss of high conservation value species of plants and beetles.
   5. Management for biodiversity conservation should initially address water quality, for example, through the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive, followed by restoration to promote structural and spatial heterogeneity of drain and peat-pit habitats.
   6. At a landscape scale, implementing ditch and peat-pit management across abandoned cut-over lowland raised bog habitats in the farmed Northern Ireland countryside, through EU Common Agricultural Policy agri-environment schemes, would give regional gains.

AB The amount of water in peat soil is one factor affecting its bearing capacity, which is a crucial aspect in planning peatland timber harvesting operations. We studied the influence of weather variables on the variation of drained peatland growing season water conditions, here the ground water table depth (WTD). WTD was manually monitored four times in 2014 and three times in 2015 in 10-30 sample plots located in four drained peatland forests in south-western Finland. For each peatland, precipitation and evapotranspiration were calculated from the records of the nearest Finnish Meteorological Institute field stations covering periods from one day to four weeks preceding the WTD monitoring date. A mixed linear model was constructed to investigate the impact of the weather parameters on WTD. Precipitation of the previous four-week period was the most important explanatory variable. The four-week evapotranspiration amount was interacting with the Julian day showing a greater effect in late summer. Other variables influencing WTD were stand volume within the three-metre radius sample plot and distance from nearest ditch. Our results show the potential of weather parameters, specifically that of the previous four-week precipitation and evapotranspiration, for predicting drained peatland water table depth variation and subsequently, the possibility to develop a more general empirical model to assist planning of harvesting operations on drained peatlands.

ID NUTRIENT REMOVAL; WATER; WETLAND
AB In 1995-2001, the efficiency of riparian buffer zone areas to reduce the concentrations of suspended solids in discharge from peatlands drained for forestry purposes was studied at.,est buffer zones reduced the concentra-7 locations in south-central Finland. The two largest buffer zones reduced the concentration of suspended solids by > 70%. The efficiency of the three medium-sized buffer zones to reduce through-flow sediment concentrations was 50-60%, but no reduction occurred at the smallest two buffer areas. Thus, the capacity of buffer zones to reduce sediment concentrations was strongly related to their size. However, significant correlations were also found between reduction capacity and inflow water sediment concentrations, although the correlations at the two smallest buffer zones were low. The use of buffer zones in reducing sediment load from peatlands drained for forestry purposes is recommended, but relatively large areas for efficient removal capacity are needed.

AB Water table depth (WTD) is one of the key variables controlling many processes in peatlands. Reliable WTD estimates based on remote sensing data would advance peatland research from global-scale climate monitoring to field-scale ecosystem management. Here, we evaluate the relationship between ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) C-band backscatter (sigma degrees) and in situ observed WTD dynamics over 17 peatlands in Germany covering deeply-drained to natural conditions, excluding peatlands dominated by forest or inundation periods. The results show increasing sigma degrees with shallower WTD (= wetter conditions), with average temporal Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.38 and 0.54 (-) for natural (also including disturbed and rewetted/restored states) and agriculturally-used drained peatlands, respectively. The anomaly correlation further highlights the potential of ASAR backscatter to capture interannual variations with values of 0.33 and 0.43 (-), for natural and drained peatlands. The skill metrics, which are similar to those for evaluations of top soil moisture from C-band over mineral soils, indicate a strong capillary connection between WTD and the ' C-band-sensitive' top 1-2 cm of peat soils, even during dry periods with WTD at around -1 m. Various backscatter processing algorithms were tested without significant differences. The cross-over angle concept for correcting dynamical vegetation effects was tested, but not superior, to constant incidence angle correction.

AB Upland peatlands in the UK are important sources of palaeoenvironmental information, providing context to human land use in upland areas. Land management practices, particularly over the last 150 years have resulted in damage to the integrity of this palaeoenvironmental record. This study focuses on the effects of drainage on the condition of pollen remains within upland peat deposits using a case study from Exmoor, southwest England. Water-table monitoring and coring across three mires enabled the effects of water-table draw-down on the condition of pollen remains within the peat matrix to be assessed. Our results show that peatland drainage, which has taken place over the last 60-150 years, caused significant localised water-table draw-down. A detailed pollen condition survey across seven coring sites demonstrates that pollen within the peat is damaged as a consequence. However, pollen is rarely so damaged that counted pollen assemblages are unreliable. Correspondence between pollen condition and past climate shifts and periods of enhanced human activity, suggests that recent damage to pollen caused by peatland drainage is superimposed on damage caused by other factors throughout the period of peat accumulation.

AB A large proportion of drained spruce mire stands is currently approaching regeneration maturity in Finland. Traditional regeneration methods with effective site preparation and planting generally result in satisfactory seedling stands also in spruce mires. However, natural regeneration methods may be more appropriate in protecting watercourses and minimizing regeneration costs. We studied the survival of advance growth and establishment of new seedlings in small canopy openings that were cut at three different diameters in two experimental drained spruce mire stands in Northern Finland (Tervola and Oulu) in 2004. The number of seedlings was repeatedly surveyed from five small circular plots (one 10 m(2) and four 5m(2) plots in size) located within the opening. Advance growth which survived the cutting and new seedlings were separated in the surveys. The density of advance growth was on average 9000 ha(-1) after cutting, and it decreased by 30% during the five-year monitoring period (2006-2010) due to natural mortality. The number of new seedlings increased rapidly within the three years after cutting the openings. In 2010, 11000-26000 new seedlings ha(-1) in Tervola and 12000-16000 ha(-1) in Oulu on average were observed. The size of the opening had no clear effect on the regeneration result. The proportion of birch of the new seedlings increased with time and opening size in Tervola. The results show that Norway spruce regenerates naturally in small canopy openings cut in mature drained spruce mire stands.

AB Background and aims In forestry-drained peatlands, drying leads to changes in C cycling which could affect peat delta C-13. Furthermore, the delta C-13 profile of the entire peat column may reveal effects of earlier climatic periods. Methods We measured peat delta C-13 and C inventories in adjacent peat profiles, two collected from undrained and two from the drained side of a bog that was partially ditch-drained 37 years earlier. The cores were sliced into 10-cm subsamples for analyses; matching of the profiles based on surface levelling, peat stratigraphic correlation and a horizontal ash layer found in both profiles. Results Surface subsidence of 30 cm was observed in the dried site and the uppermost 160 cm in the undrained site contained an excess of 5.9 kg m(-2) of C compared with the corresponding strata of the ditch-drained site. The delta C-13 values increased but markedly only in the thin surface layer of the drained site, indicating low delta C-13 of the missing C (ca. -30 parts per thousand). In the deeper strata, dating to Mid-Holocene, high dry bulk density, C%, N%, humification index and low C/N ratio were connected to low delta C-13 of peat. Conclusions Drainage of 37 years increased delta C-13 values in the upper peat profile of the drained bog and led to the selective loss of C-13 depleted C. Results indicate that C balance studies can be aided by C isotope analyses. Low delta C-13 values in the peat profile indicate the existence of a wet fen stage during the moist and warm period during Mid-Holocene.

AB Two fen peat soils, supporting a species-rich fen vegetation with a high nature value, and two accompanying drained fen peat soils, supporting vegetation types with a low nature value, were subjected to a study on nutrient deficiency. This study tested what effect rewetting of drained fen peat soils had on the nutrient deficiency. In each of the study areas, soil was collected from the wet site and from a neighbouring drained site. Holcus lanatus was used as a phytometer screening the wet soil under wet conditions and the drained soil when drained or rewetted. The soil taken from the wet site revealed a higher yield than the soil from the drained site in both study areas. Additional supply of K, in combination with N or P supply, further increased the biomass yield. K-deficiency was even stronger in the drained site of both study areas. Experimental rewetting did not entirely remove this deficiency and additionally enhanced N-deficiency. The results from this phytometer approach are discussed as related to results from field and laboratory experiments with vegetation as object of research.

AB Drainage of waterlogged sites has been part of the normal forestry practice in Fennoscandia, the Baltic countries, the British Isles and in some parts of Russia since the early 20(th) century, and currently, about 15 million hectares of peatlands and other wetlands have been drained for forestry purposes. The rate of forest clear-felling on drained peatlands will undergo a rapid increase in the near future, when a large number of these forests approach their regeneration age. A small-scale pilot survey was performed at two nutrient-rich and old peatland drainage areas in southern Finland to study if forest clear-felling has significant impacts on the exchange of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) between soil and atmosphere. The average N2O emissions from the two drainage areas during three growing seasons following clear-felling were 945 and 246 mug m(-2) d(-1). The corresponding CH4 fluxes were -0.07 and -0.52 mg m(-2) d(-1). Clear-felling had impacts on the environmental factors known to affect the N2O and CH4 fluxes of peatlands, i.e. clear-felling raised the water table level and increased the peat temperature. However, no substantial changes in the fluxes of CH4 following clear-felling were observed. The results concerning N2O indicated a potential for increased emissions following clear-felling of drained peatland forests, but further studies are needed for a critical evaluation of the impacts of clear-felling on the fluxes of CH4 and N2O.

AB The concentrations of Ca, Mg, K, Fe, Mn, Al, Cu, Zn, Mo, Pb, Cr and Cd were determined for surface peat samples for 80 sites on both undrained and drained pine mires in Finland. The oldest areas had been drained 55 years earlier. Although the gravimetric concentrations of many elements tend to decrease with increasing drainage age, the stores in the 0-50 cm peat layer do not change much along the drainage age gradient. This is possible because compaction of peat takes place after drainage, and, consequently, the 0-50 cm layer in the drained plots includes peat that was below the 50 cm limit before the sites were drained. The fact that elements are removed from soil by uptake by tree stands and by leaching is thus indicated by the decreasing, or unchanging, gravimetric concentrations only.

AB Nutrient export from drained peatland has significant impacts on aquatic environments in Nordic catchments. Spatial information on variations in nutrient concentrations across different landscapes and land uses is needed to design measures for achieving the good ecological status of the EU Water Framework Directive. In this study we determined background concentrations in natural peatland-dominated streams and examined effects of peatland use practices on water quality in headwater catchments. We quantified sources for different elements by joint analysis of water chemistry, isotopes, and hydrology for 62 small catchments in North Ostrobothnia, Finland. Concentrations of nutrients and suspended solids were relatively high in catchments containing drained peatland. In particular, dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were elevated during baseflow conditions when flow likely originated from deeper soil layers. Total concentrations of nutrients, suspended solids, and loss on ignition also showed elevated values, and changes in the ratio of dissolved and particulate forms, especially the C/N ratio, were observed. Past drainage had a stronger effect on organic matter and nutrients concentrations than local hydroclimate conditions. These results strongly indicate that current water protection methods are not sufficient to capture all seasonal variations in nutrient and suspended solid loads from drained peatland. Thus, more effort and actions are needed for water protection in such areas. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB After the drainage of fens and their permanent use as meadows, peat-forming process is being replaced by moorshing (mucking) process (mineralization and humification of peat), and then by turf-forming process. Secondary succession of soil nematodes was examined by using the chronosequence of meadow sites (period I: 1978-1983) and also by analysing the same. sites 15-17 years later (period II: 1994-1997). The analysis was focused on the taxa (genera) of nematodes and on 19 to 29 parameters describing the community as total density, density of trophic groups, diversity indices and maturity indices, The pattern of successional changes was obtained for periods from. 2 to 117 years after drainage. Natural not-drained fens were used for comparison. Soil structure and soil processes occurring over the time considered can be characterized as follows: soil moisture (by weight) 80-52%, total soil porosity 90-77%, bulk density 0.16-0.44 (to 0.92) g cm(-3), total C content in soil 47-7%, total N content in soil 4.4-0.5%, ranges in the sequence from Mt I (poorly moorshified soils) to Mt III (strongly moorshified soils). In natural fens, soil moisture was 80%, soil porosity 90%, bulk density 0.15-0.35 g cm(-3), and peat-forming processes (Pt) were continued. As compared with natural fens, drainage and management of fens was associated with increasing density of total nematodes and their components such as bacterivores, fungivores, facultative plant feeders, obligate plant feeders, omnivores, and predators. In drained fens the density of nematodes declined with succession with the exception of omnivores. The increase in the density of omnivores was positively correlated with the number of years after drainage (r = 0.48, P<0.01). The indices of taxa diversity and maturity indices were positively correlated with years after drainage (P<0.001-0.05). In natural fens, ranges of density of all trophic groups were lower, and maturity indices higher than in drained peat meadows. The mechanisms driving the first stage of succession in nematode communities (until about 30 years after the drainage of fens) seem to be tolerance to the droughts and to the excess of nitrogen what was accompanied with higher density of herbivores (mainly Paratylenchus). In later stages, interspecific competition is likely to play a more important,role. Also a statistically significant relation was found of some taxa and parameters to peat type.

TI Changes in the physical properties of drained peat soils after the
   application of sand
SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB To increase the fertility of drained peat soils and protect them from pyrogenic degradation, sand is often applied to their surface. The sand is either mixed with the material of the plow layer (mixed sanding) or is left on the soil surface to form a continuous sand cover. In both cases, the application of sand affects the physical properties of peat soils, including their bulk density, solid phase density, porosity, shrinkage capacity, and fissuring. The most pronounced changes in these properties take place upon the application of sand in the form of continuous surface cover. The additional pressure exerted by the sand and agricultural vehicles leads to the compaction of the subplow horizon. The hydraulic conductivity of the plow layer decreases by 20-25 times in comparison with the control, and its absolute values does not exceed 0.06 m/day. Under these conditions, an aquitard is formed at a shallow depth inducing the stagnation of gravitational water. This phenomenon suppresses the development of plants. Measures to protect drained peat soils from compaction are suggested.

AB It has been hypothesized that the trend in increasing DOC concentration in rivers Peat; draining from peat catchments is enhanced by drainage of the peat. It foltows that blocking DOC; of drainage ditches could stabilise or decrease concentrations of DOC in stream water flow-Drainage; ing from peat catchments. This study develops a model for the flux of DOC from a peat catchWater table ment in the North Pennines, UK. This model is used to predict the future DOC flux for an undrained and a drained catchment and for one where the drains were blocked. The model predicted that:
   i. For a pristine catchment the DOC concentration will continue to rise at an average rate of 3% per year;
   ii. Drained catchments export more DOC and increases are of the order of 15-33% over a 10-year period depending upon the drain-spacing;
   iii. When drainage is blocked improvements in DOC export are predicted but the magnitude of the decrease is critically dependent upon the drain-spacing and for the larger drain-spacings no decrease may be observed.
   Over time, the improvements in DOC export are shown to lessen as formerly drained catchments revert to behaviour like that of a pristine catchment. Since pristine catchments are predicted to continue to lose DOC at an increasing rate the blocking of peat drains can only be considered as a medium term strategy for mediating the problem.

AB A tendency for an increase in the number of fires on drained peaty soils in the humid zone of Russia is related to the unregulated water regime of these soils. These fires often lead to complete burning of the organic part of peat soil down to its mineral bottom. Depending on the initial thickness of the peat, its botanical composition, topography of the mineral surface, and other factors, fires result: in the development of various secondary pyrogenic formations. Their chemical properties are characterized; a system of combined measures to restore the fertility of humic, woody, and peaty pyrogenic formations is proposed. It is shown that sandy pyrogenic formations are often the most difficult objects for reclamation.

AB Information on the variation in soil element concentrations at different spatial scales is needed for, e.g., designing efficient sampling strategies, upscaling the processes related to carbon cycling, and planning land use and management. In spite of intensive land use, such information concerning peat soils is still scarce. We analyzed the variation in peat mineral element concentrations in boreal peatland forests drained 50-60 years earlier. We wanted to quantify the proportions of variation deriving from differences between regions and peatland basins and from within-peatland heterogeneity, and to model the variation using relatively easily measurable site and soil characteristics. We utilized 878 peat samples representing the 0-20 cm layer and collected from 289 sites in 79 peatland basins. The sites represented three different drained peatland forest site types. The two strongest gradients in the element composition captured by principal component analysis were correlated with both the North-South gradient and the site type variation, and the East-West gradient. In general, most of the variation in the element concentrations was contributed by differences among peatland basins, and variation within the floristically determined sites. Most of the element concentrations were best modeled when either the bulk density or the ash content of the peat, or both, were used in addition to site type and geographical location. The explanatory power remained modest for most element concentrations. As for the P concentrations in soil, however, our models provide means for estimating a large part of the variation among drained pine mire sites.

AB The aim of this study was to build regression models between mean water table depth (WTD, cm) and net soil CO2 emissions (g m(-2) year(-1)) using data from boreal peatlands drained for forestry. We found that net soil CO2 emissions increased linearly with increasing WTD to depths of approximately 60 cm. The regression equations differed between nutrient rich (n = 33) and nutrient poor (n = 39) study sites: net soil CO2 emissions = -115 + 12 x WTD (nutrient rich); net soil CO2 emissions = -259 + 6 x WTD (nutrient poor). These regressions can be used to estimate changes in CO2 emissions associated with changes in forest management practices.

AB Fertilization of drained peatland forests with wood ash and different commercial phosphorus fertilizers (calcium phosphates) generally give similar stand growth responses. However, it has been shown that use of calcium phosphate fertilizers generally lead to highly increased P release to recipient water courses. On the other hand, no corresponding release has been reported after ash fertilization. Soil samples from the surface peats from a nutrient poor and a fertile drained peatland site were collected before and 1-4 years after application of five different types of ash products. The changes over time in the different chemical forms of P in the substrate were studied. The results indicated that the reason for the low liability to leaching of ash fertilizers was that significant amounts of P are adsorbed by At and Fe during weathering of the ash fertilizers. However, further studies are needed to clarify whether the adsorption of P occurs with the At and Fe of the ash or the native At and Fe compounds present in soil before ash fertilization.

AB Drainage-induced shifts in physicochemical peat properties are irreversible on a decadal time span. We investigated whether carbon emissions from fen peat can be estimated using two proxies: current water levels and peat properties (as affected by drainage history, i.e. degradation legacy). We collected bare peat monoliths from a long-term drained and an undrained fen. In a crossed design, half of the monoliths was kept wet and the other half was drained. Highest carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions came from the originally undrained peat under low water levels (607 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Overall, CO2 emissions were primarily determined by drainage history, with 141 % higher emissions from the originally undrained peat. In addition, low current water levels correlated with 42 % higher emissions. Highest methane (CH4) emissions were measured in the originally undrained peat under high water levels (123 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Overall, CH4 emissions were primarily determined by current water levels, with 430 % higher emissions under high water levels. In addition, the originally undrained peat had 180 % higher emissions. The lower C efflux from originally drained peat correlated with lower concentrations of methanogens and of easily-degradable carbon substrate (cellulose). We conclude that substrate limitation in long-term drained fens ensures low baseline carbon emissions, which provides opportunities for renewed carbon sequestration by rewetting.

AB We studied the establishment of natural seedlings after seed tree cutting and scalping in two drained Scots pine peatland stands in northern Finland (Simo and Sievi). Approximately, 50ha(-1) of Scots pine stems were retained on both sites. During the six subsequent years, five seedling surveys were conducted. The effect of site preparation was analysed using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). The mean density of pine seedlings increased more quickly in the scalped plots and was ca. 1.1m(-2) after six years compared to 0.87m(-2) in the non-scalped plots, on average. Scalping increased the number of pine seedlings 2-fold compared to that in non-treated plots in Simo, however, in Sievi non-treated plots had 30% higher pine seedling density after six years. Downy birch seedling density was 9-10-fold compared to that of non-treated plots in both sites. In terms of seedling density, seed tree cutting led to satisfactory pine regeneration after just two growing seasons in drained pine peatlands, even without scalping. Scalping significantly increased the number of pine seedlings, but it also enhanced the germination of birch seedlings strongly.

AB Environmental and economic performance of forestry on drained peatlands was reviewed to consider whether continuous cover forestry (CCF) could be a feasible alternative to even-aged management (EM). CCF was regarded feasible particularly because continuously maintaining a tree stand with significant transpiration and interception capacity would decrease the need for ditch network maintenance. Managing CCF forests in such a way that the ground water levels are lower than in clear-cut EM forests but higher than in mature EM forests could decrease greenhouse gas emissions and negative water quality impacts caused both by anoxic redox reactions and oxidation and mineralization of deep peat layers. Regeneration studies indicated potential for satisfactory natural regeneration under CCF on drained peatlands. An economic advantage in CCF over EM is that fewer investments are needed to establish the forest stand and sustain its growth. Thus, even if the growth of trees in CCF forests were lower than in EM forests, CCF could at least in some peatland sites turn out to be a more profitable forest management regime. An advantage of CCF from the viewpoint of socially optimal forest management is that it plausibly reduces the negative externalities of management compared to EM. We propose that future research in drained peatland forests should focus on assessing the economic and environmental feasibility of CCF.

AB Restoration of drained peatlands has been promoted to reduce gaseous and aquatic carbon losses; however, there are conflicting reports as to its effectiveness. Here we report "hotspots" of organic matter decomposition as a result of rewetting a drained peatland in Wales, at the field-scale, in the medium/long-term with implications for water quality and greenhouse gas emissions. Low soil moisture levels, that characterise these hotspots before rewetting, regenerate electron acceptors and provide carbon and nutrients which stimulate phenol oxidase-mediated release of phenolic compounds from the peat matrix upon waterlogging. Electron acceptors are then consumed sequentially, eventually favouring CH(4) production and rising pH, despite accumulating SO(4) levels. The latter two processes promote positive feedback to increased phenol oxidase activities and the release of even more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and CH(4) from the peat matrix. Hotspot formation therefore represents an inextricably linked physico-chemical and biological positive feedback mechanism. Such hotspots account for a large proportion of the mean increase in carbon loss due to rewetting of this naturally drained peatland (e.g. at maximum mean DOC concentrations: with hotspot 997%; without hotspot 102%) and are not "outliers" but important drivers of biogeochemical fluxes that should be included in budgets for carbon and other elements (e.g. sulphur). As such, understanding hotspot formation should allow improved management strategies for restoration, carbon stocks, drinking water quality and even future geo-engineering options in the face of changes in climate and atmospheric chemistry.

AB The application of electrical resistivity tomography to peatlands supports conventional coring by providing data on the current condition of peatlands, including data on stratigraphy, peat properties and thickness of organic deposits. Data on the current condition of drained peatlands are particularly required to improve estimates of carbon storage as well as losses and emissions from agriculturally used peatlands. However, most of the studies focusing on electrical resistivity tomography surveys have been conducted on natural peatlands with higher groundwater levels. Peatlands drained for agriculture have not often been studied using geophysical techniques. Drained sites are characterized by low groundwater levels and high groundwater fluctuations during the year, which lead to varying levels of water saturation. To validate better electrical resistivity tomography surveys of drained peatlands, the aim of this laboratory study is to investigate the influence of varying water saturation levels on electrical conductivity (reciprocal of resistivity) for a variety of peat and gyttja types, as well as for different degrees of peat decomposition. Results show that different levels of water saturation strongly influence bulk electrical conductivity. Distinct differences in this relationship exist between peat and gyttja substrates and between different degrees of peat decomposition. Peat shows an exponential relationship for all degrees of decomposition, whereas gyttja, in particular organic-rich gyttja, is characterized by a rather unimodal relationship. The slopes for the relationship between electrical conductivity and water content are steeper at high degrees of decomposition than for peat of low degrees of decomposition. These results have direct implications for field electrical resistivity tomography surveys. In drained peatlands that are strongly susceptible to drying, electrical resistivity tomography surveys have a high potential to monitor the actual field water content. In addition, at comparable water saturations, high or low degrees of decomposition can be inferred from electrical conductivity.

AB We reviewed the studies on the impacts of forest harvesting on nutrient, sediment, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports from drained peatlands with the aim to identify the best practices for mitigation of detrimental water quality impacts. We concluded that so far there are no such practices that would effectively mitigate all harmful consequences of forest harvestings concurrently. Controlling water levels by executing drainage operations immediately after harvesting may decrease the exports of easily soluble and redox-sensitive elements, but the very intensive drainage necessary to lower water levels in highly decomposed peats, as those that typify peats at the clear-felling phase, would result in large exports of sediments and mineral nitrogen. Establishing a wetland buffer area between a forest harvested peatland and the receiving water course may decrease sediment and inorganic nutrient exports, but restored wetland buffers, in particular, may act as a source of DOC and dissolved organic nutrients to receiving water courses. Whole-tree harvesting might decrease nutrient exports in blanket peat areas, but its practical application is hindered by nutritional and forest harvest technology related aspects. We propose that future studies should focus on assessing the impacts of partial harvestings, which so far have received very limited attention. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Forestry practises such has drainage have been shown to decrease emissions of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) from peatlands. The aim of the study was to examine the methanogen populations in a drained bog in northern Finland, and to assess the possible effect of ash fertilization on potential methane production and methanogen communities. Peat samples were collected from control and ash fertilized (15,000 kg/ha) plots 5 years after ash application, and potential CH4 production was measured. The methanogen community structure was studied by DNA isolation, PCR amplification of the methyl coenzyme-M reductase (mcr) gene, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The drained peatland showed low potential methane production and methanogen diversity in both control and ash-fertilized plots. Samples from both upper and deeper layers of peat were dominated by three groups of sequences related to Rice cluster-I hydrogenotroph methanogens. Even though pH was marginally greater in the ash-treated site, the occurrence of those sequences was not affected by ash fertilization. Interestingly, a less common group of sequences, related to the Fen cluster, were found only in the fertilized plots. The study confirmed the depth related change of methanogen populations in peatland.

AB We studied the biomass production of moss species typical of pine-dominated drained peatland forests to evaluate their potential role in the carbon cycle of such sites. The study was carried out at two sites in Lakkasuo, central Finland. Prior to drainage, the sites had been mesotrophic and ombrotrophic. Shoots of Pleurozium schreberi, Sphagnum angustifolium, S. fuscum, S. magellanicum and S. russowii were marked in the autumn of 2004 and 2005, incorporated back in the original patches, recovered one year later, and measured for height growth, biomass, and biomass production. Biomass production varied from 16 to 388 g dry mass m(-2) yr(-1). Both height growth and biomass production were higher at the mesotrophic site, while biomass estimates did not show distinct difference between sites. Variation in production within each dominant species was considerable. A simulation with our production values and published estimates of decomposition rates showed that these species have the potential to contribute significantly to soil carbon storage in drained peatlands.

AB Growing public interest in conserving peatlands has created a need for restoration and rapid indicators of progress in peat formation. Vegetation and hydrological indicators are commonly assessed, but changes in mineralization and decomposition rates might better indicate when peat formation is underway in restored peatlands. In Finland, we investigated differences in mineralization and decomposition in the upper peat layer of five undrained and eight drained Pinus-dominated fens from 2006 to 2009. Forestry-drained fens were restored in 2007 by harvesting either whole trees or only stems, and by damming and filling ditches. Before restoration, net N mineralization rate was slightly higher in the drained than in undrained fens, whereas soil pH and Betula leaf litter decomposition rate were lower. After restoration, net N mineralization rate was similar for the undrained and restored fens, except near ditches after stem harvest. Also, soil pH and decomposition rate of Betula leaf litter became similar for undrained and restored fens. We conclude that whole tree harvest is a more suitable method for peatland restoration than stem harvest and that mineralization and decomposition rates are suitable indicators for peat formation after restoration.

AB There is increasing interest in improving understanding of evaporation within a catchment for an enhanced representation of dominant processes in hydrological models. We used a dual-isotope approach within a nested experimental design in a boreal catchment in the Scottish Highlands (Bruntland Burn) to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of evaporation fractionation in a peatland drainage network and its effect on stream water isotopes. We conducted spatially distributed water sampling within the saturated peatland under different wetness conditions. We used the lc-excesswhich describes the offset of a water sample from the local meteoric water line in the dual-isotope spaceto understand the development of kinetic fractionation during runoff in a peatland network. The evaporation fractionation signal correlated positively with the potential evapotranspiration and negatively with the discharge. The variability of the isotopic enrichment within the peatland drainage network was higher with higher potential evapotranspiration and lower with higher discharge. We found an increased evaporation fractionation toward the center of the peatland, while groundwater seepage from minerogenic soils influenced the isotopic signal at the edge of the peatland. The evaporation signal was imprinted on the stream water, as the discharge from a peatland dominated subcatchment showed a more intense deviation from the local meteoric water line than the discharge from the Bruntland Burn. The findings underline that evaporation fractionation within peatland drainage networks affects the isotopic signal of headwater catchments, which questions the common assumption in hydrological modeling that the isotopic composition of stream waters did not undergo fractionation processes.

AB Data on past peatland growth patterns, vegetation development, and carbon (C) dynamics during the various Holocene climate phases may help us to understand possible future climate-peatland feedback mechanisms. In this study, we analyzed and radiocarbon dated several peat cores from Kalevansuo, a drained bog in southern Finland. We investigated peatland succession and C dynamics throughout the Holocene. These data were used to reconstruct the long-term atmospheric radiative forcing, i.e., climate impact of the peatland since initiation. Kalevansuo peat records revealed a general development from fen to bog, typical for the southern boreal zone, but the timing of ombrotrophication varied in different parts of the peatland. Peat accumulation patterns and lateral expansion through paludification were influenced by fires and climate conditions. Long-term C accumulation rates were overall lower than the average values found from literature. We suggest the low accumulation rates are due to repeated burning of the peat surface. Drainage for forestry resulted in a nearly complete replacement of typical bog mosses by forest species within 40 years after drainage. The radiative forcing reconstruction suggested positive values ( warming) for the first similar to 7000 years following initiation. The change from positive to negative forcing was triggered by an expansion of bog vegetation cover and later by drainage. The strong relationship between peatland area and peat type with radiative forcing suggests a possible feedback for future changing climate, as high-latitude peatlands may experience prominent regime shifts, such as fen to bog transitions.

AB Ditch network maintenance promotes forest growth in drained peatland forests but increases nutrient and sediment loads, which are detrimental to water quality. Society needs to balance the harvest revenue from improved forest growth against deteriorating water quality. We examine socially optimal even-aged forest management in drained peatlands when harvesting and ditch network maintenance cause nutrient and sediment loading. The means to reduce loading include establishing overland flow fields and abstaining from ditch network maintenance. We characterize this choice analytically in a rotation framework and examine, in a numerical model, the key factors affecting the choice of forest management and water protection measures. We choose a drained peatland forest site located in northeastern Finland in the vicinity of ecologically vulnerable forest headwater streams. On the given drained forest site, we find a set of parameters under which implementing ditch network maintenance is privately but not socially optimal.

DT Article
AB The Irish canal system traverses extensive peatland in the midlands. While originally intended for commercial traffic the canal and waterways system is now considered for its amenity value, and considerable investment is being incurred in maintaining and upgrading the system. Significant experience has been gained in understanding the properties and behaviour of peat and in the reconstruction of canals. The Paper sets out some characteristics of peat in Irish midland bogs including its density and moisture content, permeability, shear strength, shrinkage, effective stress and consolidation behaviour. The experience of the Irish Office of Public Works in canal reconstruction is outlined. Particular emphasis is placed on the work involved in reconstructing the Grand Canal, which links Dublin westward to the River Shannon, following a major breach in the midlands in 1989. The analysis of the failure in the section of embanked canal peat bog and the design solution are resented. The repair techniques, involving the reconstruction of about 200 000 m3 embankment and its consolidation and waterproofing, are detailed.

AB Peatland restoration is undertaken to bring back key peatland ecosystem services, including carbon storage. In the case of drained, afforested blanket peatlands, restoration through drain blocking and tree removal may impact upon aquatic carbon concentrations and export, which needs to be accounted for when considering the carbon benefits of restoration.
   This study investigated concentrations and export of aquatic carbon from a drained, afforested blanket bog catchment, where 12% of the catchment underwent drain blocking and conifer removal (termed 'forest-to-bog' restoration), and from two control catchments: one in open bog and one that remained afforested. Using a beforeafter-control-impact (BACI) design, we found no significant increases in concentrations or export of aquatic carbon (DOC, POC or DIC) in the first year following forest-to-bog restoration (i.e. across the whole post-restoration period). However, increased DOC concentrations were observed in the first summer (2015) post-restoration, and seasonally increased DOC export was noted during storm events in the autumn of the same year. The lack of significant effects of forest-to-bog restoration on aquatic carbon export may be a consequence of the small proportion of the catchment (12%) undergoing management. In terms of management, the removal of more of the forestry residues (i.e., brash) may help to mitigate effects on aquatic carbon, by removing a potential DOC and POC source. Restoring small areas at a time (<= 12%) should result in minimal aquatic carbon export issues, in contexts similar to the current study. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands are an important terrestrial carbon store. However, heightened levels of degradation in response to environmental change have resulted in an increased loss of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and an associated rise in the level of discolouration in catchment waters. A significant threat to peatland sustainability has been the installation of artificial drainage ditches. However, recent restoration schemes have pursued drain blocking as a possible strategy for reducing degradation, fluvial carbon loss and water discolouration. This paper investigates the effect of open cut drainage and the impact of drain blocking on DOC and colour dynamics in blanket peat soil-water solutions. Three treatments (intact peat, drained peat and drain-blocked peat) were monitored in an upland blanket peat catchment in the UK. DOC and colour values were significantly higher on the drained slopes compared with those of the intact peat, which in turn had greater DOC and colour values than the drain-blocked slopes. Consequently, drain blocking is shown to be a highly successful technique in reducing both the DOC concentration and level of discolouration in soil waters, even to values lower than those observed for the intact site, which suggests a process of store exhaustion and flushing may operate. The colour per carbon unit (C/C) ratio was significantly higher at the drain-blocked site than either the intact or the drained treatments, while the E4/E6 ratio (fulvic acid/humic acid) was significantly lower at the blocked site compared to the two other treatments. The high C/C and low E4/E6 ratios indicate that drain blocking also modifies the composition of DOC, such that darker-coloured humic substances become more dominant compared to the intact site. This implies disturbance to DOC production and/or transportation processes operating within the peat. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

ID OREGON
AB Ditch outflow from four treatment areas on a drained Scots pine mire was sampled for one year before and four years after clear-cutting and different site preparation operations. Ditch-mounding, or excavation of 40-60 cm deep ditches at spacings of 12-15 m in connection with mounding, is currently considered the most reliable site preparation method for drained peatlands in Finland. High leaching rates of suspended solids were detected from the ditch-mounding area, where the ditches reached down into the mineral soil below peat layer. In contrast to clear-cutting + mounding (without ditches) and clear-cutting alone, cutting and ditch-mounding also increased the leaching of ammonium and nitrate. Phosphorus concentrations in ditch outflow following clear-cutting and site preparation increased from areas where peat contents of phosphorus sorbing minerals (aluminium and iron) were low. The study demonstrated that clear-cutting and site preparation can significantly impair water quality from drained low productive pine mires.

AB The statistical model MESAW (Matrix Equations for Source Apportionment on Watershed) was used to estimate the diffuse unit-area source emission coefficients of nitrogen in Estonian rivers. The input data included monitored riverine loads, point sources and land use categories from a total of 50 rivers/catchment areas. Two independent studies were conducted: the estimation of emission coefficients for the whole of Estonia and for a smaller study area near Tallinn. The results from both cases showed that drained peat soils were the highest diffuse source contributor in unit-area loads. The results show that the unit-area loads from drained peat soils were up to 2.3 times higher than from arable land. Moreover, a comparison of emission coefficients for the whole of Estonia and for the Tallinn catchment area indicated that coefficients can vary significantly between sources and single years. Additional detailed studies and monitoring are needed to support these conclusions.

AB The aim of this study is to comprehensively assess the change in oxidoreductive enzyme activities, due to the potential in catalyzing oxidation and reduction reactions, as the basic processes on undrained and drained peat soils. On undrained peatlands, a significant decrease of enzyme activities was observed such as xanthine oxidase, urate oxidase, phenol oxidase, and peroxidase with an increase in depth. It was connected with significantly higher porosity values, hot water extractable organic carbon, and total organic nitrogen contents, ammonium and nitrate ions concentrations, and significantly lower ash and bulk density values in the upper layers. On drained peatlands, a significant increase of enzyme activities in depth was measured. Enzyme activities such as xanthine, urate, phenol oxidase, and peroxidase were documented to be effective as new indicators and tools for changes of the moorsh-forming process in association with the oscillation of the water table caused by the drainage of the peatlands.

AB Treatment wetlands are considered best management practice as they can remove nitrogen, phosphorus and suspended solids from peat extraction or forestry runoff. Treatment wetlands are established on intact or formerly drained peatlands after restoration of the site hydrology by ditch blocking or other methods. However, drainage changes the physical properties of peat, so the hydraulic and hydrological conditions in peatlands may change. Consequently, treatment wetlands constructed on drained areas may have short residence times, resulting in poor purification results. This study determined the hydrological and hydraulic characteristics of treatment wetlands constructed on drained peatlands by studying peat hydraulic conductivity and water distribution in 20 different wetlands in Finland. Four wetlands were studied in more detail using tracer tests, water balance and continuous groundwater measurements. More than 50% of the drained treatment wetlands studied had a lower active flow depth layer (only 10 or 20 cm) with higher hydraulic conductivity (K) than normally found in pristine peatlands. At 25% of the sites, K was high at all depths investigated (down to 60-70 cm). At several sites, the water was unequally distributed across the wetland surface, indicating that only part of the wetland was being used for purification. The residence time, as determined by tracer tests, varied significantly between sites. These results indicate that past drainage still influences the hydraulics of treatment wetlands.

AB The agricultural use of drained peatlands leads to huge emissions of greenhouse gases and nutrients. A land-use alternative that allows rewetting of drained peatland while maintaining agricultural production is the cultivation of Sphagnum biomass as a renewable substitute for fossil peat in horticultural growing media (Sphagnum farming).
   We studied Sphagnum productivity and nutrient dynamics during two years in two Sphagnum farming sites in NW Germany, which were established on drained bog grassland by sod removal, rewetting, and the introduction of Sphagnum fragments in 2011 and 2016, respectively.
   We found a considerable and homogeneous production of Sphagnum biomass (>3.6 ton DW ha(-1) yr(-1)), attributable to the high nutrient levels, low alkalinity, and even distribution of the irrigation water. The ammonium legacy from former drainage-based agriculture rapidly declined after rewetting, while nutrient mobilization was negligible. CH4 concentrations in the rewetted soil quickly decreased to very low levels. The Sphagnum biomass sequestered high loads of nutrients (46.0 and 47.4 kg N, 3.9 and 4.9 kg P, and 9.8 and 16.1 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1) in the 7.5 y and 2.5 y old sites, respectively), preventing off-site eutrophication.
   We conclude that Sphagnum farming as an alternative for drainage-based peatland agriculture may contribute effectively to tackling environmental challenges such as local and regional downstream pollution and global climate change. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Drainage for forestry purposes increases the depth of the oxic peat layer and leads to increased growth of shrubs and trees. Concurrently, the production and uptake of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) change: due to the accelerated decomposition of peat in the presence of oxygen, drained peatlands are generally considered to lose peat carbon (C). We measured CO2 exchange with the eddy co-variance (EC) method above a drained nutrient-poor peatland forest in southern Finland for 16 months in 2004-2005. The site, classified as a dwarf-shrub pine bog, had been ditched about 35 years earlier. CH4 and N2O fluxes were measured at 2-5-week intervals with the chamber technique. Drainage had resulted in a relatively little change in the water table level, being on average 40 cm below the ground in 2005. The annual net ecosystem exchange was -870 +/- 100 gCO(2) m-(2) yr(-1) in the calendar year 2005, indicating net CO2 uptake from the atmosphere. The site was a small sink of CH4 (-0.12 gCH(4) m(-2) yr(-1)) and a small source of N2O (0.10 gN(2)Om(-2) yr(-1)). Photosynthesis was detected throughout the year when the air temperature exceeded -3 degrees C. As the annual accumulation of C in the above and below ground tree biomass (175 +/- 35 gCm(-2)) was significantly lower than the accumulation observed by the flux measurement (240 +/- 30 gCm(-2)), about 65 g Cm-2 yr(-1) was likely to have accumulated as organic matter into the peat soil. This is a higher average accumulation rate than previously reported for natural northern peatlands, and the first time C accumulation has been shown by EC measurements to occur in a forestry-drained peatland. Our results suggest that forestry-drainage may significantly increase the CO2 uptake rate of nutrient-poor peatland ecosystems.

AB Bog peat soils have been accumulating at Wellington Plain peatland, Victoria, Australia for the last 3300 years. Now, dried peat soils are common adjacent to bog peats. The 14C basal age of dried peat is not different from the 14C basal age of bog peat, which supports the theory that dried peat formed from bog peat. A novel application of 210Pb dating links the timing of this change with the introduction of livestock to Wellington Plain in the mid-1800s. Physical loss of material appears to have been the dominant process removing material as bog peats drained to form dried peats, as indicated by the mass balances of carbon and lead. This research has implications for the post-fire and post-grazing restoration of bogs in Victoria's Alpine National Park, and the contribution of peat soils to Australia's carbon emissions.

AB The rate of biochemical decomposition of organic matter in drained peaty soils has been studied for the common, mixed, and cover farming systems with a concurrent analysis of hydrothermic conditions. The maximum depletion of peat was observed in the plow horizon for the black system and in the plow and subplow horizons for the mixed system. For the cover system, two maximums were found for the biochemical decomposition of organic matter (in the plow horizon and in the zone of the open capillary fringe). Sanding and cover culture enhance the biochemical depletion of peat. Protection against the degradation is associated with control of the ground water table.

AB The application of multiparametric statistical methods has confirmed that peat soils are different in the degree of their drainage and properties because of their modification during a 20 - 25 year period of artificial drainage operation. The following sequence represents the relative significance of the contribution to the soil changes of the parameters studied: groundwater table > air capacity > pH > T-0 > Eh > water-soluble: C > Fe3+ > and the activity of soil oxidoreductases in the following sequence: peroxidase > catalase > dehydrogenase. The necessity to supplement the substantive - genetic principle of the classification of drained peat soils with characterization of their water regime is substantiated.

AB The long-term effects of fertilization on the needle nutrient concentrations, growth and financial performance of a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand was examined in a thick-peated drained peatland forest located in Central Finland. At the trial establishment in 1985, the trees were suffering from P and K deficiencies, but their N status was good. The fertilizer treatments were Control, PK (rock phosphate + potassium chloride), ApaBio (apatite phosphorus + biotite) and wood ash, applied both with and without N and replicated six times. All treatments containing phosphorus and potassium increased foliar P and K concentrations above the deficiency limits up to the end of the study period of 26 years. The effect of the fertilization on stand volume growth of Scots pine was strong and continued still at the end of the study period. The trees on ApaBio and PK plots grew nearly two-fold and those on Ash plots over two-fold compared with the control plots. In a thinning made at the end of the study period the total logging removal on fertilized plots was 1.5-2.2 times greater and included more saw logs than on the control plots. Ash fertilizer treatment outperformed other fertilizer treatments as well as the control. With a 5% discounted equivalent annual income (EAI) of Ash fertilizer treatment was statistically significantly (p = 0.009) almost three times higher than that of control. As a conclusion, fertilization (either using PK fertilizers or Ash) in N-rich drained peatlands is a financially feasible method of management.

TI Greenhouse impact due to different peat fuel utilisation chains in
   Finland - a life-cycle approach
SO BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID EMISSIONS; CO2
AB Greenhouse impacts of different peat fuel utilisation chains were studied. A life cycle approach was used in order to cover all important emissions and sinks due to activities linked to the peat fuel production and utilisation. Radiative forcing was used to describe the greenhouse impact, and the results are given per one petajoule of energy produced. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and sinks were considered. Investigated peat production reserves were pristine peatland (fen), forestry-drained peatland, and cultivated (cropland) peatland. The considered phases of the peat utilisation chain included peat fuel production, storage, transport, combustion and the after-treatment of the cut-away peatland. After-treatment alternatives were afforestation and restoration. The greenhouse impact of a considered peat fuel chain was calculated by subtracting the emissions/sinks of a production reserve in a state of non-utilisation from the emissions/sinks of peat utilisation chain. According to the results, the most climate-friendly peat production chain is cultivated peatland-afforestation. Cultivated peatland has large greenhouse gas emissions and these emissions from the land area are ceased by the removal of the peat layer, when the area is utilised for peat fuel production. If forestry-drained peatland or pristine fen is used for peat fuel production, the greenhouse impacts of these chains are of the order of the greenhouse impact of the utilisation chain for coal. Improvement of peat production and combustion methods can be applied to decrease to some extent the greenhouse effect of peat energy.

AB The changes in chemical, physicochemical, and physical properties of pyrogenic formations resulting from the burning of previously drained peat soils and the distribution of natural plant species on their surface are considered. Under the influence of precipitation and floodwater alkaline-earth metals are leached; pH values becomes lower; carbon, iron and manganese accumulate in the upper burnt layers. The surface horizons of pyrogenic bodies are sticky, and the burnt peat horizons have a low swelling capacity. In five or six years after the fire, stable plant associations with dominant species are formed on the surface of all pyrogenic formations. The possibility of growing crops on them is doubtful because of their low fertility and secondary swamping.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of different water management options to mitigate sediment and nutrient exports from ditch network maintenance (DNM) areas in boreal peatland forests. Available literature was reviewed, past data reanalyzed, effects of drainage intensity modeled, and major research gaps identified. The results indicate that excess downstream loads may be difficult to prevent. Water protection structures constructed to capture eroded matter are either inefficient (sedimentation ponds) or difficult to apply (wetland buffers). It may be more efficient to decrease erosion, either by limiting peak water velocity (dam structures) or by adjusting ditch depth and spacing to enable satisfactory drainage without exposing the mineral soil below peat. Future research should be directed towards the effects of ditch breaks and adjusted ditch depth and spacing in managing water quality in DNM areas.

AB In the humic River Nuorittajoki, northern Finland, the recapture rates of stocked yearling salmon, Salmo salar L., were lower in riffles affected by loading from peat mining and forest drainage areas than in the reference riffles receiving a considerably smaller loading. The salmon caught from the affected riffles were also smaller and thinner by the end of the summer than those from the reference riffles. The size was inversely related to the estimated particulate matter load imposed on the area. The salmon at the affected riffles appeared to feed less but there was no difference in the niche width between the two types of riffle. Hydropsyche and Rhyacophila larvae occupied significantly larger proportions of the stomach volume in the reference than in the affected riffles whereas Ephemerella larvae had an opposite trend. These observations suggest changes in the foraging of yearling salmon in riffles affected by increased particulate matter loading from drained peatlands.

AB Most of the spruce-dominated pristine mires in South Finland have been drained for forestry, and a large proportion of these forest stands are currently approaching regeneration maturity. We investigated the potential impact of the drainage of pristine mire on the species composition of root endophytes compared to undisturbed mire and mineral soil. Additionally, we further evaluated the inhibitory effect of a subset of the isolated endophytes on the root rot pathogen Heterobasidion parviporum. A total of 113 isolates of fungal root endophytes were obtained from non-mycorrhizal Picea abies roots, which were assigned to 15 different OTUs. Most of the isolates consisted of dark septate endophytes (77 %); the Phialocephala fortinii s.1. Acephala applanata species complex was the most dominant group, comprising 52 % of all the isolates. No significant differences in the frequency of isolates were observed between the sites. All the diversity indices suggest relatively low or mid-level versatility of the endophyte community, with mineral soil sites having the lowest index and drained peatland the highest. Nineteen of the isolates (17 %) inhibited the growth of the conifer root rot pathogen in vitro. The potential of these endophytes to serve as alternative antagonistic agents to control and manage Heterobasidion root rot disease is discussed.

AB Precipitation is a key factor affecting shallow water table fluctuations. Although the literature on shallow aquifers is vast, groundwater response to precipitation in peatlands has received little attention so far. Characterizing groundwater response to precipitation events in differently managed peatlands can give insight into ecohydrological processes. In this study we determined the groundwater table response rate following precipitation events at a drained and a rewetted fen to characterize the effect of rewetting on hydrological buffer capacity. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the groundwater table at the rewetted fen has more than two times lower rate of response to precipitation events than that of the drained fen, even after adjusting for antecedent groundwater levels. Thus, the rewetted fen delivers a better hydrological buffer function against heavy precipitation events than the drained fen. We found that for the depths at which the groundwater interacts with incoming precipitation, the peat of the rewetted fen has a higher specific yield causing groundwater to rise slower compared to the response at the drained fen. A period of 20 years of rewetting was sufficient to form a new layer of organic material with a significant fraction of macropores providing storage capacity. Long-term rewetting has the potential to create favorable conditions for new peat accumulation, thereby altering water table response. Our study has implications for evaluating the success of restoration measures with respect to hydrological functions of percolation fens. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Open-water mire pools play an important role in sustaining biodiversity. However, many mire pools have disappeared by artificial drainage all over the world. This study aimed at exploring how mire pools are changed by artificial drainage in terms of open water area and vegetation in Shizukari Mire, Hokkaido. We analyzed the changes of drainage ditches and open water of mire pools using multi-temporal aerial photographs. In order to elucidate how pool plant communities change by drainage, we analyzed the vegetation on the persisting pools and drained area of former pools. Our results indicated that most pools were lost soon after digging of ditches, and the remaining pools have shrunk by more diffuse, continued drainage effect. Due to open water loss, pool plant communities were considered to change towards the plant communities of drier conditions, comprising woody plants and non-wetland plant species. If the drainage continues, the remaining mire pools will ultimately disappear and the species composition of the mire could become more homogenous, being dominated by few species with high coverage.

   chamber measurements; mitigation action; data assimilation
AB Northern peatlands are important carbon (C) reservoirs, storing about one-third of the global terrestrial soil C pool. Anthropogenic influences, such as drainage for agriculture and forestry, lower the originally high groundwater level, leading to peat aeration and decomposition. This is particularly reflected in significant losses of CO2, while fluxes of N2O and CH4 are generally considered of minor importance for the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of cultivated peatlands in Scandinavia. Setting land aside from agricultural production has been proposed as a strategy to reduce GHG emissions from drained peatland, restore natural habitats, and increase C sequestration. However, the evidence for this is rather scarce unless drainage is terminated. In this study, we measured respiration using dark automatic chambers, and CO2, N2O, and CH4 fluxes using manual static chambers, on: 1) cultivated peatland and 2) adjacent set-aside peatland in Central Sweden. The set-aside site was found to be a greater source of respiration than the cultivated site, while higher N2O fluxes and lower CH4 uptake rates were observed for the cultivated site. However, to compare the full GHG balance and assess the abandonment of drained cultivated peatland, additional measures, such as gross primary production (GPP) but also dissolved organic C losses would have to be taken into account.

Only a few studies have estimated the LUE for boreal peatlands and none has calculated the LUE for a drained boreal peatland due to the limited availability of direct measurement of GPP and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), which are required to calculate the LUE. In this study, we used eddy covariance (EC) measurement of GPP and APAR at a drained peatland pasture and an adjacent boreal bog to calculate the LUE. The pasture had a significantly higher LUE (0.034 +/- 0.0109 mol mol(-1)) than the bog (0.028 +/- 0.098 mol mol(-1)). The LUE showed significant year-to-year variation at the pasture, but not at the bog. The LUE variation strongly correlated with air temperature and water table depth at both sites, but did not correlate well with vapor pressure deficit. This study indicates that agricultural drainage significantly alters the LUE of boreal peatlands and that the drained peatlands need to be considered separately in LUE-based models for northern peatlands. Moreover, a longer period of study is needed to fully understand the temporal dynamics of LUE in natural peatlands.

AB Northern forested peatlands contain a large pool of terrestrial carbon (C). When drained for forestry, these peatlands may become sources of Cot remain C sinks, depending on site nutrient level, climate, and average water level depth. However, previous studies do not consider the impact of other silvicultural practices on the C dynamics in drained peatlands. Clearfellings cause disturbance in ecosystem C dynamics and might lead to losses of C to the atmosphere. The initial development of C dynamics following clearfelling in a drained peatland forest in Finland was investigated in a 4-year study which included monitoring of ground vegetation development and chamber based measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) and heterotrophic peat soil respiration (R-PEAT). NEE measurements showed that the site was mainly a net CO2 source (May-October mean efflux of 1990 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)) to the atmosphere during the three measurement seasons after clearfelling. This was caused by decrease in photosynthesizing biomass and by high R-ECO (May-October mean efflux of 2540 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)). The recovery of ground vegetation biomass was rather fast. However, during the 3 years after clearfelling its capability to fix carbon could not compensate the high R-ECO, which was mainly caused by excessive amounts of easily decomposable fresh organic matter (dying tree roots, logging residue and dying ground vegetation). Clearfelling slightly decreased the decomposition rates of peat (R-PEAT) (May-October mean efflux of 1130 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)) i.e., the oldest and largest C storage of the site, through two mechanisms: R-PEAT in deeper layers was restricted by higher water table level and in surface layers by excessive dryness, which lowered the temperature response of R-PEAT. We conclude that clearfelling strongly affects ecosystem C dynamics but does not affect the peat C storage. The appearance of new tree stand is needed before the ecosystem could act as a C sink again. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Land drainage is common in peatlands. Artificially drained blanket peat catchments have been shown to have a significantly greater soil pipe density than intact catchments. This paper investigates the role of surface land drains in the enhancement of soil piping in blanket peats. The density of piping was found to significantly increase in a linear fashion with the age of the drainage. Thirty-five years after drains were cut, slopes would be expected to have twice the density of soil piping than would an undrained blanket peat catchment. The rate of pipe erosion increases exponentially over time, so that particulate carbon loss from subsurface pipes is greatest where drains are oldest.

AB We used habitat suitability modeling to investigate whether the 15% ecosystem restoration target set in the previous Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) and EU Biodiversity strategy targets, is sufficient to safeguard red-listed mire plant species. We assessed six theoretical restoration scenarios for drained peatland landscapes by altering the proportion of drained and undrained peatland area in 25-ha grid cells. The proportions represented steps when 15%, 30%, 45%, 60%, 75% and 100% of the drained peatland is restored. We modelled the habitat suitability for 48 red-listed plant species in the aapa mire region in boreal Finland. Model outcomes were assessed at the level of five species groups: calcareous species, rich fen species, decaying wood species, mesotrophic fen species, and spruce swamp species. The predicted distribution increased for 34 (71%) of the 48 red listed plant species when 15% of drained peatland area was predicted to be restored. At the same time the potentially occupied area of species increased by 9%. In the scenario where all peatlands were restored, the predicted distribution of 43 (90%) of species increased, and on average the distribution of species quadrupled. According to our predictions, meeting the 15% ecosystem restoration target, set in the previous CBD and EU Biodiversity strategy targets would be beneficial for most of the boreal red-listed mire plant species, but a larger restoration area would expand their distribution considerably more. Our study shows that a landscape level approach is important to assess thresholds for the potential biodiversity benefits arising from peatland restoration. The models can also be used to select suitable areas for restoration. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Northern peatlands contain substantial reservoirs of carbon (C). Forestry activities endanger the C storages in some of these areas. While the initial impacts of forestry drainage on peatland greenhouse gas (GHG) balance have been studied, the impacts of other silvicultural practices, e.g. logging residue (LR) retention or removal, are not known. We measured the CH4, N2O and CO2 fluxes between peat soil and atmosphere with and without decomposing LR over three (2002-2004) seasons (May-Oct) following clearfelling in a drained peatland forest, along with the mass loss of LR. Seasonal average CO2 efflux from plots with LR (3070 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)) was twice as high as that from plots without LR (1447 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)). Less than 40% of this difference was accounted for by the decay of logging residues (530 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)), so the majority of the increased CO2 efflux was caused by increased soil organic matter decomposition under the LR. Furthermore LR increased soil N2O fluxes over 3-fold (0.70 g N2O m(-2) season(-1)), compared to plots without LR (019 g N2O m(-2) season(-1)), while no change in CH4 emissions was observed. Our results indicate that LR retention in clearfelled peatland sites may significantly increase GHG emissions and C release from the soil organic matter C storage. This would make the harvesting of LR for biofuel more beneficial, in the form of avoided emissions. Further investigations of the sources of CO2 under logging residues are, however, needed to confirm this finding. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We studied bacterial production and respiration in acidic, carbon-rich waters originating from natural, drained, and restored mires during dry and rainy summers. In addition, we tested how mixing of these waters with oligotrophic lake water affected short-term microbial activity and decomposition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). After mire restoration, concentrations of DOC, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), ammonium (NH4-N), and phosphate (PO4-P) increased in mire waters. Concentrations of DOC and organic N also increased after a rainy period in waters running from drained and natural mires. Bacterial production and respiration were strongly correlated with the concentrations of DOC, N, and P. Microbial activity in lake water was stimulated by these compounds in the mire waters. Bacterial growth efficiency was strongly related to the availability of NH4-N. Mixing of lake water with mire waters caused no additional stimulation of DOC decomposition; thus, our results do not support the "priming effect" hypothesis that lake-originated DOC would promote decomposition of recalcitrant mire-originated DOC in oligotrophic headwater lakes.

AB Northern peatlands can emit large amounts of carbon and harmful smoke pollution during a wildfire. Of particular concern are drained and mined peatlands, where management practices destabilize an array of ecohydrological feedbacks, moss traits and peat properties that moderate water and carbon losses in natural peatlands. Our results demonstrate that drained and mined peatlands in Canada and northern Europe can experience catastrophic deep burns (>200 t C ha(-1) emitted) under current weather conditions. Furthermore, climate change will cause greater water losses in these peatlands and subject even deeper peat layers to wildfire combustion. However, the rewetting of drained peatlands and the restoration of mined peatlands can effectively lower the risk of these deep burns, especially if a new peat moss layer successfully establishes and raises peat moisture content. We argue that restoration efforts are a necessary measure to mitigate the risk of carbon loss in managed peatlands under climate change.

AB Drainage of peatlands increases the depth of the oxic peat layer and can turn them into a carbon (C) source to the atmosphere. Afforestation of drained peatlands could help to reverse this process since the trees may enhance C sequestration. We followed the C and water dynamics of an afforested drained peatland in S-Iceland during a 2 year period, during which the Black Cottonwood (Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa) plantation was 23-25 year old. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) was measured with the eddy covariance method and C pools of trees and ground vegetation were measured using the stock change method. Lateral losses of dissolved and particulated organic C (DOC, POC) were estimated from weekly water-runoff samples. Unexpectedly, the afforested drained peatland was a strong sink of carbon during the two years, with an average NEE value of 714 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Only 0.5% of the total NEE was lost through lateral DOC and POC transport, leaving 710 g C m(-2) yr(-1) as the total net ecosystem production (NEP). Ca. 91% of the observed NEP could be explained by the annual biomass increment of the Black Cottonwood trees and 1.3% by the ground vegetation. This means that the remaining 7.5% of the total NEP most likely accumulated in peat soil and litter, contributing to the soil C stocks. The dormant-season CO2 emissions were unexpectedly low, which was explained by a high groundwater level at this drained site outside the ca. 5 months of the active growing season. On average, 66% of the annual measured precipitation was estimated to have evaporated back to the atmosphere. This left 416 mm for potential runoff, which was somewhat lower value than the measured runoff (662 mm). These results indicate that during the age span of ca. 20-25 years, afforestation was a valid method to reverse the expected negative C-balance of this drained grassland pasture in Iceland. Although the site is currently a soil C sink, simulation studies with process models are needed to test whether such sites could remain C sinks when managed for forestry over several tree-stand rotations.

AB Recent findings have indicated that the carbon density and store in peat soil may increase after drainage for forestry, even if soil respiration has clearly increased. This is caused by the increased organic C flow from tree stands into soil and consequent retention in the pear matrix. Relocation of C-14-activity released from the labelled needle and fine root litter during 4- and 8-month incubation experiments showed that, on average, only 60-80% of the activity lost from litter was emitted to the atmosphere. The proportion retained in the moss layer was from 7 to 14%, in the pear soil from 7 to 18% and in the water percolated through the peat from < 1 to 8%. The results thus support the hypothesis that organic C flow may contribute to C storage in drained peat soils. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Large-scale peat extraction, in Finland and elsewhere, typically takes place on rather small extraction sites but has major impacts on surrounding aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The environmental conditions prior to drainage (baseline conditions) must be quantified in a statutory environmental impact assessment (EIA), but this is generally difficult due to lack of historical data. In this study, we developed and tested a method for EIA based on a reference area approach and remote sensing. The method calculates the normalized difference vegetation index in preextraction and postextraction periods using Landsat images of affected areas and reference surrounding areas. In a case study, we applied the method to assess changes after peat extraction at a site in northern Finland. The peat extraction area showed significant transformation from peatland vegetation to bare soil. Adjacent areas downstream and upstream were also affected by extraction. These results indicate that our method is a useful tool for EIA of peatland drainage.

AB In Finland nearly 6 million hectares of peatlands are drained for forestry purposes. Ditch network maintenance in the drained peatlands, i.e. cleaning old ditches or digging complementary ditches, deteriorates surface water quality by increasing the export of dissolved elements and suspended solids (SS). Effect of ditch network maintenance on the export of SS, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), iron (Fe), aluminum (Al) and manganese (Mn) was studied in nine pairs of treated and control (no maintenance) catchments located in southern and central Finland. In this study we extended the paired catchment approach by combining data from several catchments and identifying the treatment effect on SS and element loads from the entire dataset. Following the method of Lauren et al. (2009) we identified how uncertainty in correlation between treatment and control catchments during pre-treatment period is reflected in the estimated treatment effect on SS and element loads. In the experiment, the export of SS increased significantly for the four year study period following the ditch network maintenance and Al export increased for one year. The export of N, P and Fe was not significantly changed and DOC and Mn export decreased after the ditch maintenance operation.

DT Article
AB It is shown that the potential fertility of virgin Peat soils is determined by the amount of organic matter and total nitrogen. The effective fertility of drained Peat soils depends on the transformation of the organic matter and nitrogen resources. Regularities are established for the transformation of organic matter and nitrogen resources of drained Lowland Peat soils by soil-climatic zones of the country, from the Extreme North to the southern boundary of their distribution. It is established that similar processes of transformation of organic matter and nitrogen occur in developed soils located in different soil-climatic zones: a decrease in the content of easily hydrolyzable and an increase in the amount of difficultly hydrolyzable organic nitrogen-bearing compounds, as well as the accumulation of mineral forms of nitrogen. With a similar botanical composition of peat, identical drainage norm, and method of utilizing the peat bog, the intensity of these processes depends on the geographic latitude of its location and increases from north to south on the European continent.

ID BALANCE; SOILS
AB Peat-forming organic soils lose large amounts of carbon and soil volume when drained. Although surface subsidence is often taken as a proxy for the associated carbon loss, other mechanisms also cause a change in volume. To infer the reliability of subsidence for estimating carbon loss, we compared long-term subsidence rates of an 80 ha area of temperate fen that was drained 140 yr ago against estimates of subsidence based on soil bulk densities measured at four sites. Both methods correlate significantly, yield similar subsidence rates of 0.8-1.6 cm/yr and underpin the value of using profile information for inferring volumetric loss. Peat oxidation accounts for 28-64% of the loss in volume, which is equivalent to annual carbon loss rates of 2.5-5.5 t C/ha. Whereas the profile-based method is also suitable for estimating carbon loss, the wide range of oxidative contribution to the overall subsidence indicates that subsidence alone cannot provide an unbiased estimate of carbon emission factors from drained fens.

ID ACID SULFATE SOILS; CLASSIFICATION
AB The Pyrenean range (NE Iberian Peninsula) has some favourable lithological and climatic conditions (iron-rich parent materials and udic moisture regimes) for the formation of acid sulfate soils (ASS) that have not been reported on from the region until now. The analyses of a drained peat bog near Valencia d'Aneu revealed a pH (1:2.5) of 3.7. We hypothesize that it contained sulfidic materials that were oxidized during drainage, which could have caused its acidification. The main goal of this study is to understand the characteristics and the potential acidity of these organic soils and the consequences that this could generate in the current environment. In order to do so, several profiles were described and sampled in the field for chemical and micromorphological analyses. The results show that the oxidation of the newly formed pyrite in the soil or pyrite contained in the Cambro-Ordovician parent material was responsible for the low pH and high electrical conductivity (EC). The soils still contain sulfidic materials at present, which could be oxidized in the future, with the consequent risk for water quality. The results will be useful to evaluate the risk of other peats in the Pyrenees becoming acid sulfate soils if drained.

AB Half of the Finnish peatland area is drained for forestry. The remaining undrained peatlands are not all pristine, because surrounding drainage may disturb their hydrology. This concerns especially aapa mires, which are dependent on hydrological connections to their upper catchments. We investigated the amount and sizes of Finnish undrained peatlands, the drainage state of their margins, and the naturalness of aapa mires in large (> 50 ha) undrained peatland areas, using a GIS analysis based on digital map data, aerial images and an elevation model. The results show that a majority (66.7 % of count, 84.7 % of area) of undrained peatland areas have at least partly drained margins. Drainage activities commonly disturb minerotrophic water discharge to aapa mires. In the middle boreal zone, on average 41.6 % (median 42.8 %) of the catchment area of aapa mires is such that hydrological connection with the mire is disturbed by intervening drainage. In the southern boreal zone, the figure is 25.1 % (median 16.1 %), and in the southern part of the northern boreal zone 24.2 % (median 9.9 %). Possible implications of the disturbances include tree encroachment, hummock formation and fen-bog transition, which is likely to cause a loss of biodiversity but could potentially increase peat growth and carbon sequestration.

AB Drainage of peatlands for forestry often leads to carbon dioxide (CO2) net emission from soil due to loss of peat. This emission can be compensated for by the increased tree growth. Hovewer, many drained peatlands have low tree growth due to nutrient limitations. Tree growth at these peatlands can be effectively increased by fertilization, but fertilization has been also found to increase decomposition rates.
   We studied the long-term effect of fertilization of low-productive forestry-drained peatlands on the complete ecosystem greenhouse gas exchange, including both soil and tree component, and accounting for CO2, methane and nitrous oxide. Five N-rich study sites (flark fens and a rich fen) and one N-poor ombrotrophic site were established. Fertilization had started at the study sites 16-67 years before our measurements.
   Fertilization considerably increased tree stand CO2 sink ( + 248-1013 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1)). Decomposition increased on average by 45% ( + 431 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1)) and litter production by 38% ( + 360 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1)). Thus, on average 84% of the increased decomposition could be attributed to increased litter production and 16% to increased soil CO 2 net emission due to increased loss of peat. Soil CO2 net emission correlated positively with water table depth and top soil N concentration.
   Fertilization increased soil CO2 net emission at the drained flark fens on average by 187 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1). At the rich fen, net emission decreased. The N-poor bog exhibited soil CO2 sink both with and without fertilization. Effects on methane and nitrous oxide emissions were small at most sites.
   The increase in tree stand CO2 sink was higher than the increase in soil CO2 net emission, indicating that fertilization has a climate cooling effect in the decadal time scale. Yet, as the fertilized plots at N-rich sites exhibited soil CO2 source or zero balance, continuation of fertilization-based forestry over several rotations would lead to progressive loss of ecosystem C. At the N-poor bog, fertilization-based forestry may have a climate-cooling effect also in the centennial time scale.

   RATES; CO2 FLUXES; DECOMPOSITION; BALANCE; VEGETATION; CLIMATE; METHANE
AB The drawdown of the water level has been hypothesized to change peatlands from carbon (C) sinks to C sources to the atmosphere as a result of increased oxidation of organic matter. We measured the change in peat thickness (subsidence of peat surface) ca. 60 years after drainage in 273 peatland sites (875 points) representing three nutrient levels of pine fens and five macroclimatic regions from southern to northern Finland, and we calculated the changes in peat C densities and peat C stores using direct measurements and estimates drawn from regression models for C density derived in this study. On average, the peat surface had subsided ca. 22 +/- 17 cm (mean +/- SD), the C density had increased by 26 +/- 15 kg.m(-)3, and the C stores had increased by 5.9 +/- 14.4 kg.m(-2) after drainage. Therefore, the hypothesis that drainage of peatland always makes them sources of C to the atmosphere is incorrect. We concluded that the post-drainage subsidence of peat surface was mainly caused by changes in the physical structure of peat after the removal of water while the oxidation of peat was of less importance. The changes in C density and C stores seemed to be dependent on the input of new C into the system through net primary production, especially through the fine roots of trees. Our results suggest that tree stand development plays an important role in the post-drainage C balance of peat soils.

AB Open ditch drainage has historically been a common land management practice in upland blanket peats, particularly in the UK. However, peatland drainage is now generally considered to have adverse effects on the upland environment, including increased peak flows. As a result, drain blocking has become a common management strategy in the UK over recent years, although there is only anecdotal evidence to suggest that this might decrease peak flows. The change in the hydrological regime associated with the drainage of blanket peat and the subsequent blocking of drains is poorly understood, therefore a new physics-based model has been developed that allows the exploration of the associated hydrological processes. A series of simulations is used to explore the response of intact, drained and blocked drain sites at field scales. While drainage is generally found to increase peak flows, the effect of drain blocking appears to be dependent on local conditions, sometimes decreasing and sometimes increasing peak flows. Based on insights from these simulations we identify steep smooth drains as those that would experience the greatest reduction in field-scale peak flows if blocked and recommend that future targeted field studies should be focused on examining surface runoff characteristics.

AB Drainage is known to affect peatland natural hydrology and water quality, but peatland restoration is considered to ameliorate peatland degradation. Using a replicated BACIPS (Before-After-Control Impact Paired Series) design, we investigated 24 peatlands, all drained for forestry and subsequently restored, and 19 pristine control boreal peatlands with high temporal and spatial resolution data on hydro climate and pore water quality. In drained conditions, total nitrogen (N-tot), total phosphorus(P-tot), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in pore water were several-fold higher than observed at pristine control sites, highlighting the impacts of long-term drainage on pore water quality. In general, pore water DOC and Ntot decreased after restoration measures but still remained significantly higher than at pristine control sites, indicating long time lags in restoration effects. Different peatland classes and trophic levels (vegetation gradient) responded differently to restoration, primarily due to altered hydrology and varying acidity levels. Sites that were hydrologically overrestored (inundated) showed higher P-tot, N-tot, and DOC than well restored or insufficiently restored sites, indicating the need to optimize natural-like hydrological regimes when restoring peatlands drained for forestry. Rich fens (median pH 6.2-6.6) showed lower pore water P-tot, Ntot, and DOC than intermediate and poor peats (pH 4.0-4.6) both before and after restoration. Nutrients and DOC in pore water increased in the first year postrestoration but decreased thereafter. The most important variables related to pore water quality were trophic level, peatland class, water table level, and soil and air temperature.

AB Forestry-drained peatlands occupy approximately 15 million ha in boreal and temperate zones. In Finland, they represent almost one-fourth of the total forest area. They are subjected to the same harvesting operations as upland forests. Although the soil deformation caused by timber harvesting is well documented in upland forests, the knowledge on the soil disturbance induced by the harvesting machinery on peat soils is still lacking. To address this, we collected soil samples from six peatland sites that were thinned using a harvester-forwarder combination. Peat samples were taken from the trails formed by the machinery and outside the trails to a depth of 10 cm. To assess the recovery of soil properties after the disturbance, we sampled sites along a chronosequence with respect to time since harvesting. Soil deformation under the machinery appeared to increase the bulk density and field capacity of peat and decrease its total porosity; however, disturbed plots and control plots started to resemble each other in their soil properties within 15 years. The results imply that peat soil is sensitive to disturbance but has a high recovery potential.

ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; PEAT; PEATLANDS; FLOW; WATER; HYDROLOGY;
   CLIMATE; TRANSPORT; SIZE
AB Field data of topography, water levels, and peat hydraulic conductivity collected over a 28-year period have revealed the impacts of marginal drainage on uncut raised bog ecohydrology and its peat properties. Drainage of the regional groundwater body has induced changes in the hydraulic properties of deep peat, with peat compression decreasing hydraulic conductivity and storativity while simultaneously introducing localized secondary porosity and effective storage. Where peat has increased in hydraulic conductivity, there is a corresponding decline in vertical hydraulic gradients and significant localized increases in recharge to the underlying substrate. Repeated topographic surveys show intense localized areas of peat consolidation (>5%) where it is underlain by highly permeable (>10 m/day) glacial till deposits. More widely, continued subsidence (4-6 mm/year) of the bog surface has been measured over 900 m from the bog margin, resulting in the progressive loss of approximately 40% of actively growing raised bog since 1991. This loss has thus been shown to be attributable to changes in the underlying groundwater head due to deep-cut drainage, rather than near-surface peatland drainage. However, although reinstating regional hydrostatic pressures in order to restore this ombrotrophic peatland may control the rapid drainage through preferential flow pathways, this may not eliminate the ecological impacts resulting from changed surface morphology arising from subsidence. Hence, this longitudinal study provides new insights into the role that aquifer systems and groundwater bodies play in maintaining hydrogeological processes in ombrotrophic peatland systems, while highlighting the difficulty in ecological restoration where regional groundwater dependencies are significant.

In response to this research gap, E-N2O was measured fortnightly for 1 year in the Waikato region in a plot that was not grazed or nitrogen (N) fertilised. The time series was variable, the frequency distribution skewed and the fortnightly means correlated. To account for these factors, the data were log(e) transformed and an order 2 autoregressive model used to estimate a mean E-N2O of 4.3gNha(-1)d(-1) and 95% confidence limits of 0.6-29.1gNha(-1)d(-1). There was a statistically significant, inverse relationship between E-N2O and the depth to groundwater. In winter, when rainfall totalled 393mm, E-N2O and soil N content were significantly greater under a rain shelter designed to minimise N loss by leaching, than in an uncovered plot.

AB Aims Fine root production is a major carbon flux in many peatland ecosystems and least understood because of methodological difficulties. We aimed to develop a robust method for inventorying fine root production in peatlands.
   Methods The ingrowth core method was modified to reduce disturbance and facilitate faster colonization by developing a novel type of corer-installer that reduces cutting of roots during installation, and using smaller volume of initially root-free substrate. The number of cores needed for a reliable site-level mean was estimated based on the variation observed in the test sites. Infrared calibration models were constructed for estimating the mass proportion of roots in the ingrowth cores without manual separation.
   Results We observed first-year production of 118, 216, 170 and 125 g m(-2) yr(-1) in the 0-50 cm soil layer for boreal drained bog forest, drained fen forest, wet sedge fen and dry sedge fen, respectively. Between 10 to 30 cores per site was estimated to be enough for obtaining reliable mean estimates of production. The infrared calibration models yielded high coefficient of determination (0.72-0.83) and low standard error of prediction (5-8 %).
   Conclusions We suggest that the methodology presented here saves time and manual labour and may be applied with a high number of replicates for inventorying fine root production in peatlands. Practical guidelines are presented.

AB The effects of the underground pipe drainage and land use on the carabid and staphylinid communities were studied using pitfall trapping and soil sampling. Various soil characteristics were studied and compared with community data. The number of species discovered by both pitfall trapping and soil sampling was lower in drained plots. The difference in the number of species was more distinct by soil sampling. The activity of beetles was apparently higher by soil sampling. The activity of beetles was apparently higher in drained plots. Drainage resulted in the extinction of hygrophilous species. The main factors affecting the carabid and staphylinid communities were organic matter content and actual moisture. The water table depth had smaller influence on beetles.

AB Erosion and suspended sediment transport dynamics were studied in the open water season (April-November) of three consecutive years in a drained peatland forest. Discharge and suspended solids were monitored continuously and sediment properties surveyed with individual samples. Sediment transport dynamics were studied using statistical methods and plotted as hysteresis, duration and effective discharge plots. Sediment rating curves for averaged daily data for months and total season were established to seek empirical sediment yield predictive model(s). The discharge patterns in the study catchment were dominated by peak runoff events resulting from snowmelt and intensive rainfall. Fluctuations in suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) were associated with discharge fluctuations. Sediment transport varied markedly during the study months and years, with organic sediment playing an important role. The present study demonstrates sediment transport processes and reveals the underlying mechanics operating in forested peatland areas. These include inter-storm sediment storage, bank collapse and the role of peak runoff rate on erosion in peak flow events. Sediment availability in drainage network channels also played a major role in erosion and SSC. The results indicate that summer runoff peaks can be a dominant element controlling annual sediment yield, partly contradicting previous studies in drained peatland areas identifying spring snowmelt as the dominant element. Sediment yield prediction with the empirical sediment-transport rating curve gave good regressions for some data, but simple regression models were not adequate to provide accurate annual predictions.

AB There are only a few studies focusing on the financial aspects of management regimes on peatland forests and even fewer studies investigating intensive management. Such studies, however, are urgently needed, particularly in Finland, where a considerable proportion of drained peatlands is reaching a phase requiring active management. An empirical data set derived from the 10th National Forest Inventory (NFI10) is applied for stand-level simulations (MOTTI stand simulator) until final cut. The data are a representative sample of the most common drained peatland site types and their current stand structures in Finland. Based on several different initial stand conditions, tree growth was projected according to four management regimes: (1) passive management (only one clearcut executed), (2) management according to prevailing silvicultural recommendations, (3) stand-level optimum without ditch network maintenance (DNM) and fertilization (FERT), and (4) stand-level optimum with DNM and FERT (intensive management). The intensive management regime financially outperformed the other management options distinctively, regardless of the climatic region, peatland site type, and initial stand structure. However, towards more harsh climatic conditions and a more barren site type, the financial difference between management options flattened out, and silvicultural recommendations even resulted in a higher mean annual increment (MAI) compared with intensive management.

AB Forest drainage has been used rather widely to improve tree growth in peatlands in northern and northeastern Europe and some parts of North America. The consequent fundamental change in the vegetation presumably gives rise to a concomitant change in the distribution of nutrients within the ecosystem. We investigated the post-drainage dynamics of soil properties ( top 30-cm) and tree stand biomass on a series of peatlands drained for forestry in Finland to evaluate the sufficiency of soil nutrient pools for production forestry, and the ability of a floristic-ecological peatland site type classification for estimating soil nutrient status. The nutrient dynamics were assessed by comparing the nutrient pools in a large number of peatland sites differing in drainage age. Drainage unambiguously influenced stand biomass and structure and, consequently, the nutrient pool bound in trees. Nevertheless, with the exception of Mg, ditching did not decrease soil nutrient pools over the 75-year observation period. Thus, the soil pools seem sufficient for forest production on these sites. The decreasing trend in the soil Mg pool points on a potential risk in the long run, however. Peat depth and temperature sum were identified as significant sources of variation for the soil nutrient pools. Using soil Ca, K, Fe and N pools, on average 49% of our sites were grouped correctly according to the floristic-ecological site type classification. This classification most successfully described soil nutrient status among the most nutrient-poor sites. We concluded that the floristic-ecological classification of drained peatlands successfully describes their production potential, but not their total nutrient pools in varying thermoclimatic conditions.

AB The relationship between peat hydrophysical properties and solute transfer to drainage ditches was examined for a pump-drained soligenous valley fen in SW England.  Drainage increased the bulk density and lowered the hydraulic conductivity of the peat, to the extent that, water table drawdown could not be detected beyond 5 m from the drainage ditch or field drains.  The water table drawdown zone acted as the source of solutes transfered to the drainage ditch on pumping.  A distinct solute release sequence was recorded in the drainage ditch, with SO4-S peaking before NH4-N, which was followed by Ca, Mg and NO3-N.  Ca and Mg release was delayed by up two days following a pump event.  Solute concentrations in pump-drained ditches were significantly higher than those of drainage channels unaffected by pumping.  Solute transfer from the peat as a result of pump drainage, has resulted in water quality deterioration within the peatland.

Yet they are hitherto disregarded evidence for resource management, settlement development and social organisation. This paper is a study of several log dugouts from a bog near the Medieval hamlet of Skatamark, putting them into context and testing methods of analysing such finds. They have a large scientific potential. The results from Skatamark hint at a new interpretation of the establishment of permanent settlement in the lower Lule River Valley.

AB Background: Northern peatlands are known for having significant stocks of terrestrial soil carbon (C). However, little is known about how peatlands function under various land uses and what impacts land-use change has on their functioning in central Europe.
   Aim: The objective of our study was to quantify the variability and controls of typical plant communities in terms of C gas dynamics on bogs and fens affected by a changed hydrological regime in the Bohemian Forest, Czech Republic.
   Methods: Carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange and methane emissions (CH4) were measured in bogs (pristine, drained, restored) and in fens (pristine, drained) during the 2009 growing season. We applied cluster analysis to define plant communities and non-linear response models to quantify the variation in CO2 dynamics among the communities.
   Results: Drainage had a strong impact on vegetation; forest and meadows species were dominant on drained peatland sites and the vascular green area was higher than on pristine sites. The net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) varied from -27 to 241 g CO2-C m(-2) per growing season on the bogs and from 27 to 153 g m(-2) on the fens. The most-drained parts of the bog and fen with the most changed vegetation structure acted as both net C sources and very weak C sinks; however, areas dominated by Molinia caerulea acted as a strong C sink. Plant communities on the wetter parts of drained sites had a positive seasonal NEE, comparable with NEE on pristine sites. Seasonal CH4 emissions were relatively low (0-9 g CH4-C m(-2)) at all sites and did not influence net C balance, with the exception of pristine fen where CH4 emissions with average 90 g C m(-2) led to a negative total growing season C balance. Water regime restoration caused neither a significant change in plant composition nor any major changes, such as plant die-back or increased CH4 emissions during the first season after restoration.
   Conclusions: Our results showed that C gas fluxes, and in turn the C balance of the whole ecosystem, were largely determined by plant community type. Drainage did not necessarily lead to a negative ecosystem C balance; however, a significant change of species composition occurred on most drained areas. The less-drained parts on drained sites, where original peatland species and original functions are preserved, could facilitate future ecosystem restoration.

AB We studied natural and forestry-drained peatlands to examine the effect of over 34 years lowered water table on the delta C-13 values of vegetation, bulk peat and subsoil. In the seven studied sites, delta C-13 in the basal peat layer was 1.1 and 1.2 parts per thousand lower than that of the middle-layer and surface layer, respectively. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the delta C-13 values of the basal and surface peat layers, possibly due to carbon (C) recycling within the peat column. In the same mire complex, natural fen peat delta C-13 values were lower than those of the nearby bog, possibly due to the dominance of vascular plants on fen and the generally larger share of recycled C in the fens than in the bogs. Furthermore, natural and 51 years previously drained fen and bog, on the opposite sides of a ditch on the same mire complex, showed no significant differences in delta C-13 values. Plant delta C-13 values were lower, while delta C-13 values of subsoil were higher in the drained than in the natural site of the fen.

AB Increasing use of wood fuels for energy production in Finland since the 1990s implies that large quantities of the generated ashes will be available for forest fertilization. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of wood ash application on Cs-137 activity concentrations in Scots pine (Anus sylvestris L) needles and certain berries and mushrooms on drained peatlands. The study was based on field experiments carried out on two mires in Finland in 1997-1998. Two different types of wood ash were applied at dosages of 3500, 3700, 10 500 and 11 100 kg ha(-1). Wood ash did not increase Cs-137 activity concentration in plants in the second growing season following application. On the contrary, a decrease in Cs-137 activity concentration was seen in the plants of the ecosystem on drained peatlands. This result is of importance, for instance, when recycling of ash is being planned. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The relevance of the research is determined by the need to assess the impact of drainage reclamation as a factor in the formation of a potential fire hazard.
   The main aim of the study is assessment of the potential fire hazard of typical drained mires of Tomsk region.
   The methods used in the study. Determination of the potential fire hazard is conducted using the point system evaluation of factors of fires within the mires on the basis of the field landscape studies carried out in 2014-2015. The scales of the potential fire hazard assessments are based on the pyrogenic characteristics of the mire geosystems components (plant layer dominant, mire water level, upper layer peat type), and the degree of anthropogenic load on them. Potential fire hazard of a territory is defined as a sum of points for each evaluation criterion.
   Results. Mires under investigation are characterized by medium and high potential fire hazard due to the low level of mires waters as a result of drainage reclamation, mire availability for local people as a place of hunting and gathering wild plants. Oligotrophic drained mires are characterized by greatest potential fire hazard due to the ease of ignition and flammability of pine, heather bushes, sphagnum moss and peat. Thus, the studies have revealed the most fire hazardous areas and may form the basis for predicting the risks of peat fires, for developing recommendations of the rational use and for reduction of fire hazard of anthropogenically disturbed mires of Tomsk region.

AB Restoration of drained peatland forests is an important tool in maintaining and improving biodiversity in the boreal region. It has been shown to cause leaching of nutrients from the restoration area to lower waterbodies. Two drained peatland systems of different ecohydrological types in the Nuuksio (60 degrees 18'N, 24 degrees 27'E) and Seitseminen (61 degrees 56'N, 23 degrees 26'E) national parks were restored and total organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus leaching was monitored for 6 years after restoration. The richer site proved to leach more nitrogen and less total organic carbon and phosphorus than the poor site although the per-treatment-area excess leaching of organic carbon caused by restoration was higher in the richer site. The pattern of excess leaching was more stable in the poor site. The differences in leaching reflect the ecohydrological differences between these two peatland basins. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Global peatlands store more carbon than is naturally present in the atmosphere(1,2). However, many peatlands are under pressure from drainage-based agriculture, plantation development and fire, with the equivalent of around 3 per cent of all anthropogenic greenhouse gases emitted from drained peatland(3-5). Efforts to curb such emissions are intensifying through the conservation of undrained peatlands and re-wetting of drained systems(6). Here we report eddy covariance data for carbon dioxide from 16 locations and static chamber measurements for methane from 41 locations in the UK and Ireland. We combine these with published data from sites across all major peatland biomes. We find that the mean annual effective water table depth (WTDe; that is, the average depth of the aerated peat layer) overrides all other ecosystem- and management-related controls on greenhouse gas fluxes. We estimate that every 10 centimetres of reduction in WTDe could reduce the net warming impact of CO2 and CH4 emissions (100-year global warming potentials) by the equivalent of at least 3 tonnes of CO2 per hectare per year, until WTDe is less than 30 centimetres. Raising water levels further would continue to have a net cooling effect until WTDe is within 10 centimetres of the surface. Our results suggest that greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands drained for agriculture could be greatly reduced without necessarily halting their productive use. Halving WTDe in all drained agricultural peatlands, for example, could reduce emissions by the equivalent of over 1 per cent of global anthropogenic emissions.

AB Open cut drains are the most frequently used drainage technique in peatlands and are common throughout the world. Land drains increase the drainage density and promote enhanced coupling of hillslope sediment sources with streams. They may be major sources of fine sediment to peatland stream systems but data on drain sediment production in peatlands are rare. Many drains are now being dammed by humans, yet some revegetate naturally. This paper presents a survey of the erosion and natural revegetation of peat drains related to variables such as slope, drainage area and shading. The paper also provides measured comparison of sediment flux from open drains, drains that have been blocked by peat dams, undisturbed subcatchments, and the catchment outlet. Natural infilling of drains was often found to occur on gentle slopes < 4 degrees. Drains on slopes < 2 degrees were rarely eroded, while drains on slopes > 4 degrees were rarely infilled. Nick-point retreat at the confluence of drains was often observed. Revegetation of drains was uncommon where drains have been cut or incised into the underlying mineral substrate. Where the drain floor was peat-based, revegetation was much more common. Revegetation of drain floors was affected by overhanging vegetation, which provided shading. Drain floors with less than 60% shading tended to have a greater vegetation cover than drains with 60-90% shading. However, drains that were almost totally shaded (> 90%) had the greatest floor vegetation. The intact drains were found to be major sources of suspended sediment within the survey catchments, with 18 center dot 3% of the sediment originating from the unblocked drains which drained 7 center dot 3% of the area. The winter quarter of the year was more important than other seasons for producing suspended sediment, even though precipitation totals were not greatest during this period. Drains which had been dammed at intervals along their length using peat blocks had very low sediment yields. Even poorly dammed drains, where water could still flow along the full course of the drain, had 54 times less suspended sediment production than unblocked drains.

AB Wood ash contains all the essential plant nutrients except nitrogen, and thus supports tree growth especially on peatlands where mineral nutrients often are in short supply. Here we report the effects of wood ash fertilization on the soil microbial community in a boreal drained peatland, characterized by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition, and more specifically the fungal community, characterized with PCR-DGGE fingerprinting and sequencing methods. We investigated the microbial communities in unfertilized and ash-fertilized sample plots (loose wood ash 5000 or 15 000 kg ha(-1)) 6 years after fertilization. Microbial function measured as heterotrophic basal respiration increased over 30% in the surface peat layer after wood ash fertilization, yet the result was statistically insignificant. The higher amount of wood ash induced a shift in the microbial community in the surface peat layer (0-10 cm) along with an increase in pH. A higher relative proportion of fungal-specific PLFA 18:2 omega 6 and an increased fungal:bacterial ratio indicated that fungi benefited from the higher amount of wood ash in the topmost layer. Also, the lower amount of wood ash seemed to have stimulated actinobacteria. Our results indicated that higher pH and extra nutrients due to wood ash fertilization promoted the appearance of mycorrhizal and wood-decomposing fungi directly or via increased tree growth. We suggest that wood ash as a fertilizer would be a natural and economical choice to improve the nutrient status of drained peatlands used for forestry since it maintains the positive feedback between fungi and trees.

AB We quantified the response of peatland water table level (WTL) and energy fluxes to harvesting of a drained peatland forest. Two alternative harvests (clear-cut and partial harvest) were carried out in a mixed-species ditch-drained peatland forest in southern Finland, where water and energy balance components were monitored for six pre-treatment and three post-treatment growing seasons. To explore the responses caused by harvestings, we applied a mechanistic multi-layer soil-plant-atmosphere transfer model. At the clear-cut site, the mean growing season WTL rose by 0.18 +/- 0.02 m (error estimate based on measurement uncertainty), while net radiation, and sensible and latent heat fluxes decreased after harvest. On the contrary, we observed only minor changes in energy fluxes and mean WTL (0.05 +/- 0.03 m increase) at the partial harvest site, although as much as 70% of the stand basal area was removed and leaf-area index was reduced to half. The small changes were mainly explained by increased water use of spruce undergrowth and field layer vegetation, as well as increased forest floor evaporation. The rapid establishment of field layer vegetation had a significant role in energy balance recovery at the clear-cut site. At partial harvest, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements and model-data comparison suggested the shade-adapted spruce undergrowth was suffering from light stress during the first post-harvest growing season. We conclude that in addition to stand basal area, species composition and stand structure need to be considered when controlling WTL in peatland forests with partial harvesting. Our results have important implications on the operational use of continuous cover forestry on drained peatlands. A continuously maintained tree cover with significant evapotranspiration capacity could enable optimizing WTL from both tree growth and environmental perspectives.

AB We estimated the global warming potential of Estonian peatlands (transitional fens and ombrotrophic bogs) based on greenhouse gases (GHG) CO2, CH4, and N2O and carbon (C) accrual in biomass, and the effects of drainage on these processes. Data were derived from a review of the literature of boreal peatlands. Areal estimates of peatland types were Multiplied with the values of the interquartile range of literature-derived GHG fluxes. The effect of drainage and radiative forcing of Estonian peatlands were also evaluated. Annual emission Of CO2, CH4, and N2O is estimated to be 278 to 1,056 x 10(3) Of CO2 equivalent (eq), of which CO2 makes up 22 to 44%, CH4 53 to 73%, and N2O 3 to 5%. The annual efflux is 419 to 676 x 10(3) CO2 eq year(-1) from drained peatlands, and - 141 to 380 x 10(3) CO2 eq year(-1) from the undrained peatlands. The annual loss of C from peatlands is estimated to be 38 to 86 tons C x 10(3) year(-1). Thus due to drainage, Estonia's transitional fens and ombrotrophic bogs have gone from being sinks to sources of C.

AB Monocultures of Norway spruce widely used for afforestation of drained peat soils often have low productivity and decline in vitality. The research aim was to elucidate: (1) imbalances in the nutrient status of soil and plants in relation to Norway spruce crown status and annual increment on drained peat soil in the sub-boreal zone; (2) the suitability of using proline accumulation as a biomarker for Norway spruce vitality and stress in nutrient imbalance conditions. The study was conducted at five forest (Oxalidosa turf. mel.) sites in Latvia, each containing trees with different crown condition status. Chemical analyses of soil and spruce needles, assessment of tree crown vitality and annual increment measurements were done. Our results revealed serious disturbances in the supply of nutrients, which is an important factor in the decline of Norway spruce in monoculture stands on drained peat soils. Deficiency of K, Fe, Cu, B, N and P was found in the current year needles for all trees, but in damaged trees (>= 61% defoliation, >= 61% discoloration) Zn deficiency was also found. For 2-year-old needles, deficiency of K, P, S, Zn, and Cu was found in all trees, additionally, deficiency of Fe was found in healthy and medium damaged trees (26-60% defoliation, 21-60% discoloration), and N deficiency was found for medium damaged and damaged trees. Thus, K, Cu, B, Fe concentrations had significant negative correlations with crown status parameters - defoliation, discoloration, and density. K and B deficiency could play the most significant causal role in decreased stem increment. The results revealed that the stress amino-acid proline is a reliable biomarker, having a significant relationship with spruce crown condition parameters, annual increment and nutrient status in needles - low levels of K, Fe, S, Cu, B, N. The increase in proline content in spruce needles was pronounced in moderately damaged trees, indicating the potential for the use of proline accumulation as early stress indicator for spruce. Therefore, further studies on the identification of early stress and factors affecting nutrient uptake and accumulation in needles are particularly valuable for evaluation of stand management options before significant decline of spruce stands.

ID PEATLANDS
AB Natural mires generally act as sinks for CO2 and are sources of CH4 for the atmosphere. However, drainage may transform these ecosystems into net sources of CO2, but the increase in growth of the tree stand and consequent fixation of carbon after drainage may be expected to have a compensating effect. The post-drainage change in the peat carbon stores was determined using a method based on the bulk density and carbon content profiles measured along a transect running from the undrained part to the drained part of the mire. The difference between the undrained and drained peat carbon stores, averaged over the 30 yr period after drainage, indicated that the accumulation of carbon had been 35 g C m(-2) yr(-1) greater in the undrained site. As the long-term accumulation rate of the undrained site had been 21 g C m(-2) yr(-1), the drained part had lost 14 g C m(-2) yr(-1) from the pre-drainage carbon store. Total accumulated biomass in the tree stand was estimated from stem wood development using the growth and yield tables for this site type. The stem wood volumes were transformed into total biomass values using published stem-volume/total-biomass ratios. If no harvesting operations were to occur during the first 300 yrs, the tree stand would produce an average carbon store of approximately 11 kg C m(-2). The application of a standard thinning regime would reduce this storage by ca 50%. Expressed as an average over 300 yrs, drainage increased the total carbon store of the mire if no tree harvesting was done and the store remained unchanged if standard harvesting procedures were used.

AB Currently, due to prolonged soil drought, dehydrated peat soils are particularly exposed to subsidence and, as a consequence, even to disappearance from the natural environment, in which they perform many important functions, e.g. storage of organic carbon and water retention. Therefore, predicting of settlement and disappearance processes of these soils is very important issue. This study was conducted to: (1) determine the degree and rate of subsidence of a drained peatland over 40 years, (2) establish the effect of subsidence on the depth of ditches and a watercourse, (3) verify empirical equations describing the subsidence based on field measurements. The work was carried out on fen in Central Poland which was managed as a grassland until around 2000, and then its use was discontinued. Subsidence rate was estimated from measurements of the peat deposit thickness taken in 11 locations in 1978 and 2018. Fourteen empirical equations used for estimating subsidence rate of drained peatlands were selected to verify the calculations against field data. The average subsidence rate of the studied peatland was relativity low (0.62 cm year(-1)), which may be associated with abandoning of agricultural use for the last 20 years. Loss of peat thickness varied from 5 to 41% and depended rather on drainage intensity than on its initial depth. In general, six from the verified empirical equations were useful in estimating average subsidence rate. Four equations seemed to be the most useful for deeply drained sites. Estimation of the subsidence solely on the basis of time since drainage may be biased.

AB About a quarter of the global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to agriculture, forestry and other land use. Few studies of afforested drained peatlands have measured exchanges of all three major greenhouse gases (GHG) at a given site, leading to uncertainty in estimated GHG budgets. Thus, we measured forest floor exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) at a well-drained afforested peatland in southern Sweden. The CO2 emissions (76000 kg ha(-1) a(-1); SE 6000) were large compared with previous measurements at similar sites, which may have been partly due to a measurement technique that did not underestimate the flux. A net CH4 uptake of 4.4 kg ha(-1) a(-1) (SE 0.41) and a net N2O emission of 2.7 kg ha(-1) a(-1) (SE 0.23) were found, which agreed well with published models relating fluxes to stand biomass (CH4 models) or soil C:N ratio (N2O models).

AB Habitat loss and degradation are the main threats to biodiversity worldwide. For example, nearly 80% of peatlands in southern Finland have been drained. There is thus a need to safeguard the remaining pristine mires and to restore degraded ones. Ants play a pivotal role in many ecosystems and like many keystone plant species, shape ecosystem conditions for other biota. The effects of mire restoration and subsequent vegetation succession on ants, however, are poorly understood. We inventoried tree stands, vegetation, water-table level, and ants (with pitfall traps) in nine mires in southern Finland to explore differences in habitats, vegetation and ant assemblages among pristine, drained (30-40 years ago) and recently restored (1-3 years ago) pine mires. We expected that restoring the water-table level by ditch filling and reconstructing sparse tree stands by cuttings will recover mire vegetation and ants. We found predictable responses in habitat structure, floristic composition and ant assemblage structure both to drainage and restoration. However, for mire-specialist ants the results were variable and longer-term monitoring is needed to confirm the success of restoration since these social insects establish perennial colonies with long colony cycles. We conclude that restoring the water-table level and tree stand structure seem to recover the characteristic vegetation and ant assemblages in the short term. This recovery was likely enhanced because drained mires still had both acrotelm and catotelm, and connectedness was still reasonable for mire organisms to recolonize the restored mires either from local refugia or from populations of nearby mires.

AB The rewetting of drained peatlands is currently a common practice for re-establishing near-natural hydrological conditions and for reducing peatland greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), which are enhanced under peatland drainage and extraction. In the originally bare and drained peatland Himmelmoor (Quickborn, Germany), the rewetting process started stepwise in 2004 by blocking drainage ditches with peat as well as by creating polders surrounded by peat dams. In this research we examined differences in CO2, methane (CH4) and N2O emissions between a flooded (FL) area, a bare peat dam (PD) area and an abandoned (but still drained) extraction (E) area during a period in 2012 and during a period of two years in 2014-2016. The results showed that all study areas were GHG sources, although large differences were identified between the different sites. Winter CO2 emissions from all sites (FL, PD, E) were within the range previously reported for rewetted peatlands, but summer CO2 emissions from PD (1-20 mu mol m(-1) s(-1)) strongly exceeded the reported average range for similar surfaces. Very low and irregular CH4 fluxes were detected at both PD and FL, ranging from -6 to 24 nmol m(-2) s(-1) at PD and from -13 to 49 nmol m(-2) s(-1) at FL. In comparison to other peatlands, the observed N2O emissions were high, especially at the PD sites with maximum daily means of 23 nmol m(-2)s(-1) in the summer of 2012. In general, the flooded excavation sites (FL) showed lower GHG emissions than the not-rewetted excavation area (E). Also, despite the relatively small coverage of the peat dams (PD), these areas showed a larger total GHG emission than the E and FL sites. This negative effect of peat dams during the first years after flooding could be mitigated by stimulating their colonisation by moss or heath vegetation, which reduces the soil N pool and thus can be expected to reduce N2O fluxes from the peat dams.

DE bromide; bromine; pear; rewetting; wetlands
AB Currently there is growing interest in the restoration of drained peatlands in Britain. In order to investigate some of the effects of changes in land management practices on the biogeochemistry of peatlands, a field experiment was designed to manipulate the hydrological conditions in a naturally drained acid gully mire in Mid-Wales. We report preliminary results of the effects of experimentally rewetting the mire on the hydrochemistry of bromide in the peat-water. Results show that rewetting had a dramatic effect on the concentrations of bromide, which increased substantially. Peak values approached 1 mg/dm(3) in some samples following rewetting, compared with typical values <0.05 mg/dm(3) under the drained conditions. Bromide nias positively and significantly correlated with Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOG) in the peat-water, which suggests that Br- is derived from breakdown of organic matter in the reducing conditions following rewetting. The bromide mobilized by rewetting may be leached out of the system and/or re-assimilated by the wetland vegetation. Further monitoring is needed to determine whether the observed hydrochemical response of bromide to rewetting of the mire has any longer-term effects.

AB Peatland drainage can have major ecological and biogeochemical impacts on aquatic environments in boreal regions. In the Sanginjoki river catchment in North Ostrobothnia, Finland, peatland drainage is suspected to increase the acidity of recipient waters. Possible reasons are acid sulphate soils (ASS) or black schist deposits, which occur especially in lower parts of the river basin, or increased transport of humic substances. It is not known how long acidification has affected water quality and biota in the river. To study historical pH levels, we examined sediment cores from two ponds in the main channel of the Sanginjoki river and one small lake in the Sanginjoki catchment. Diatom and geochemical analysis and Cs-137-derived chronology were combined to estimate historical pH levels and changes in land use practices. The results suggest that changes in land use in the 1970s have affected runoff acidity. During that period, there was a change in diatom communities and sediment geochemistry, indicating that land use in the catchment area, most likely peatland drainage, had probably changed suspended sediment fluxes and pH conditions. The results also showed that changes in pH levels probably did not originate from ASS or black schist horizons, but rather mainly from humic substances leached from the catchment area. However, ASS and black schist deposits may have had an influence on pH levels in lower parts of the Sanginjoki river during dry/wet periods. Thus, the findings suggest that future changes in land use and land management are likely to cause increased acidity in the Sanginjoki catchment. Therefore actual or potential acidification of river water should be included in risk assessments and future land use practices, and should be avoided by not changing natural humic-rich ecosystems.

AB Sedge dominated peatlands do not rehabilitate well after being drained for rangelands and specific approaches are required in order to restore these sites. Restoration by blocking drainage canals aims to recover peatland functions, principally by raising the water table. Field surveys in Ruoergai, China identified the status of peatland degradation and satellite image analysis concluded that most of Ruoergai's peatlands are degraded mainly due to drainage and overgrazing. The restoration approach used in Ruoergai resulted in increased water levels up to 26 cm higher than previously recorded in canals. Levels in shallow water canals also increased up to 50 cm, which led to an overflow of water and rewetting of the adjacent peatlands. This resulted in one peat-mining site being filled with water and aquatic vegetation. Pioneering vegetation including Heleocharis Horsetail (Equisetum heleocharis) and Halerpestes (Halerpestes tricuspis) colonized in the restored sites. It was concluded that blocking canals could be an effective method to restore hydrological function of drained peatlands and contribute to vegetation recovery. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Forestry drainage is the main management practice of peatlands in Finland. The influence of drainage and management on carbon (C) fluxes may vary, e.g., depending on the original peatland type. We have studied C fluxes in two forestry-drained peatlands with different nutrient status.
   Our hypothesis that the differences in the C balance between these two sites can be attributed to differences in soil respiration rates, and in particular to the priming effect, was tested with laboratory microcosm flux measurements and C-14 isotopic partitioning method. A two-pool mixing-model based on the natural difference in the respired (CO2)-C-14 between the peat and plants was employed.
   We found no statistically significant priming effect in either nutrient-poor or nutrient-rich soil, respectively.
   As no differences in priming effect were found, we can conclude that the nutrient status of the sites does not affect the priming effect in the peat soils studied here, thus our results suggest that organic soils do not support priming to the same extent as mineral soils.

AB The percentage distribution of virgin and drained mire types was studied over the period 1984-1986.  Fifty-five large sample areas (10 x 10 km2) were taken at random, and five small plots (1 km2) were studied in each.  The line transect method was used, the total mire transect length being 1 543 km.  The survey covers 60 site types.  The material is treated both as a whole and divided into bog and aapa mire areas.  Twenty-six per cent of the peatlands are nowadays in natural condition.  Twenty-six mire types are more or less rare or endangered.  Draining has accentuated the contrasts in virgin vegetation between the bog and aapa mire areas.  The virgin peatlands of the bog area are nowadays more forested, drier and more ombro-oligotrophic than 30 years ago, while those of the aapa mire area are wetter, more open and mesotrophic.  Draining has been chiefly concentrated in the forested mire types (spruce mires, pine mires/bogs, birch fens, pine fens).  Many mire types are unprofitable for forestry purposes.  Their proportion of the drained peatlands is 17%.  The drainage percentage for these unsuitable types averages over 50%.

It was established that the diploid set of all of the studied populations contains 24 chromosomes. When their karyotypes were compared, differences were noted in the total length of the chromosome set, and also in the number, localization, and frequency of occurrence of secondary constrictions and nucleoli. In the pine population on a raised bog, two pairs of chromosomes with four secondary constrictions were found for the first time. Chromosome mutations were discovered in the seed progeny of the investigated populations. The peculiarities that were revealed may be connected with different environmental conditions.

AB The lowering of water tables by ditching in boreal, minerotrophic peatlands modifies soil environmental factors that regulate nitrogen mineralization-immobilization. Long-term responses of nitrogen mineralization to drainage may vary depending on substrate pH and chemical composition. Research has shown that peat drainage and N fertilization of boreal Histosols increase growth rates of coniferous trees. This study was conducted to determine the response of N mineralization to lowering of water tables and to relate N mineralization to selected soil properties. Net N mineralization rates were determined by in situ incubation of peat samples in paired natural and drained areas of midcontinental boreal fens representing a gradient in soil pH from 4.0 to 7.2. Analysis of variance of N mineralization revealed a significant interaction between soil pH and drainage category. At pH 4.0, net N mineralization did not differ between the natural and drained areas. At the intermediate pH levels, net N mineralization in the natural areas was up to two times that of the drained areas. At pH 7.2, the N mineralization relationship between the two areas was reversed. Post-ditching increases in peat bulk density in the sites of intermediate pH correlated with higher volumetric water content and lower concentration of inorganic N compared with the natural areas. The concentration of inorganic N decreased by about 50% with soil depth to 30 cm in both the natural and drained areas. Although small for all soils, net NO3- production was not influenced by the pH level or drainage category from 7 to 30 yr after ditching.

TI CONIFER PLANTATIONS ON DRAINED PEATLANDS IN BRITAIN - A NET GAIN OR LOSS
   OF CARBON
SO FORESTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID PRODUCTS; TREES; SOILS
AB It is estimated that British peatlands, excluding lowland fens, contain about 3000 million tonnes of carbon, 76 per cent of which is in deep peats (> 45 cm deep) and 9 per cent of which has been drained and planted with trees.
   Undisturbed peatlands emit CH4 but accumulate CO2-derived carbon. The net greenhouse effect may be near zero. Peatland drainage virtually stops methane emission and increases CO2-carbon loss through aerobic decomposition, but can also increase CO2-carbon fixation by the peatland vegetation partly through microbial mineralization of nitrogen, resulting in either a net loss or gain in CO2-carbon.
   Planting conifer forests leads to an accumulation of CO2-derived carbon in the trees, wood products, litter and forest soil up to equilibrium values, totalling about 16.7 kg C m-2 for Picea sitchensis, Yield Class 12. Deep and shallow peats in the British uplands contain about 0.47 and 0.80 kg cm-2 per centimetre depth, respectively. Thus, the 16.7 kg C m-2 that is stored by P. sitchensis (Yield Class 12) is equivalent to the carbon stored in about 35.5 cm of deep peat or 20.9 cm of shallow peat. If forests are planted on peats substantially deeper than this, there could be a net loss of CO2-carbon in the long term.
   Scenarios are presented for the time course of CO2-carbon gain and loss when peatlands are drained and planted with conifers. If CO2 loss rates from drained peats are 50-100 g C m-2 a-1 there is likely to be increased carbon storage in the whole system for at least three rotations; but if CO2 loss rates are 200-300 g C m-2 a-1, increased storage may be restricted to the first rotation, after which there is a net loss of carbon.

LA English
DT Article
AB Ninety hectares in a treed fen in north central Alberta were drained to improve growth of stagnant black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) and tamarack (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch) stands. Installation of 30-, 40-, 50-, and 60-m ditch spacings resulted in a lowering of the average water table by 79, 66, 56, and 73 cm, respectively. The results and the groundwater level criteria used (drainage norm, 40 cm; flood duration limit, 14 days) indicated that the 50-m ditch spacing was hydrologically the most appropriate one for this area. Given the relatively high hydraulic conductivity of the area, it is believed the 30-m spacing was too narrow and resulted in an excessively low average water table. The 60-m spacing was also overeffective, but in this case, overeffectiveness was attributed more to "edge effects" i.e., to site factors such as the proximity to uplands and the small size of upstream source area, than to the distance between ditches. The results illustrate the importance, for ditch network design purposes, of taking into account hydrologic conditions both within and well beyond the boundaries of an area proposed to be drained. Peat subsidence after drainage appeared to be related to the average drop in water table level and amounted to about 5 cm . a-1.

AB Thermokarst lakes and peat-accumulating drained lake basins cover a substantial portion of Arctic lowland landscapes, yet the role of thermokarst lake drainage and ensuing peat formation in landscape-scale carbon (C) budgets remains understudied. Here we use measurements of terrestrial peat thickness, bulk density, organic matter content, and basal radiocarbon age from permafrost cores, soil pits, and exposures in vegetated, drained lake basins to characterize regional lake drainage chronology, C accumulation rates, and the role of thermokarst-lake cycling in carbon dynamics throughout the Holocene on the northern Seward Peninsula, Alaska. Most detectable lake drainage events occurred within the last 4,000 years with the highest drainage frequency during the medieval climate anomaly. Peat accumulation rates were highest in young (50-500 years) drained lake basins (35.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and decreased exponentially with time since drainage to 9 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the oldest basins. Spatial analyses of terrestrial peat depth, basal peat radiocarbon ages, basin geomorphology, and satellite-derived land surface properties (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF)) from Landsat satellite data revealed significant relationships between peat thickness and mean basin NDVI or MNF. By upscaling observed relationships, we infer that drained thermokarst lake basins, covering 391 km(2) (76%) of the 515 km(2) study region, store 6.4-6.6 Tg organic C in drained lake basin terrestrial peat. Peat accumulation in drained lake basins likely serves to offset greenhouse gas release from thermokarst-impacted landscapes and should be incorporated in landscape-scale C budgets.

AB We studied organic matter accumulation dynamics in peatland surface soil, using the root collar depth of tree-ring aged Scots pine seedlings for dating the base level of quantitative soil samples. The data consisted of 222 samples collected from 47 forestry-drained and four undrained locations. At the drained sites, the data indicated an average dry biomass accumulation of about 4 kg m(-2) in samples representing the past 30 years. Despite great variance in the data, the results clearly indicate decreasing per annum accumulation values with increasing sample age, thus implying rapid decomposition of the fresh litter. Derived from the age-mass relationship we can estimate that about 95% of 1 year's litter input will be decomposed during 30 years. High decomposition rate of the litter suggests that drained peatland forest soils do not act as a carbon sink. The average detritus accumulation values were somewhat higher on the undrained control sites than on the drained sites. Among the forestry-drained sites, the average accumulation was significantly lower in sites with timber volumes exceeding 200 m(3) ha(-1), as compared with sites with timber volumes <100 m(3) ha(-1), suggesting a connection between tree stock and litter decomposition rate.

AB Open ditch drainage is a commonly implemented land management practice in upland blanket peatlands, particularly in the UK, where policy decisions between the 1940s and 1970s led to widespread drainage of the uplands. The change in the hydrological regime associated with the drainage of blanket peat is poorly understood, yet has perceived importance for flooding, low flows and water quality. We propose a new simplified physics-based model that allows the associated hydrological processes and flow responses to be explored. The model couples four one-dimensional models to represent a three-dimensional hillslope, allowing for the exploration of flow and water table response throughout the model domain for a range of drainage configurations and peat properties. The model is tested against a data set collected from Oughtershaw Beck, UK, with results showing good model performance for wet periods although less conformity with borehole observations during rewetting periods. A wider exploration of model behaviour indicates that the model is consistent with the hydrological response reported in the literature for a number of drained blanket peat sites, and therefore has potential to provide guidance to decision makers concerning the effects of management practices. Through a global sensitivity analysis, we conclude that further field investigations to assist in the surface and drain roughness parameterisation would help reduce the uncertainty in the model predictions.

AB The aim of this study was to develop individual-tree diameter and height growth models for Scots pine, Norway spruce, and pubescent birch growing in drained peatlands in Finland. Trees growing in peatland sites have growth patterns that deviate from that of trees growing in mineral soil sites. Five-year growth was explained by tree diameter, different tree and stand level competition measures, management operations and site characteristics. The drainage status of the site was influencing growth directly or in interaction with other variables. Site quality had a direct impact but was also commonly related to current site drainage status (need for ditch maintenance). Recent thinning increased growth of all species and former PK fertilization increased growth of pine and birch. Temperature sum was a significant predictor in all models and altitude for spruce and birch. The data were a subsample of the 7th National Forest Inventory (NFI) sample plots representing northern and southern Finland and followed by repeated measurements for 15-20 yrs. Growth levels predicted by the models were calibrated using NFI11 data to remove bias originating from the sample of the modelling data. The mixed linear models technique was used in model estimation The models will be incorporated into the MOTT1 stand simulator to replace the current peatlands growth models.

AB Peatlands have been widely developed for pasture usage through drainage and with the introduction of forage grasses; however, the effects of drainage and plant community change on methane (CH4) emission have not yet been well addressed. In this study, CH4 emissions, environmental factors, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soil pore water were investigated across a disturbance gradient (i.e., the natural peatlands, the drained peatlands, and an abandoned peatland pasture). Our results show that in addition to temperature and water table, the substrate availability (DOC as a proxy) is also an important regulator of CH4 emission. For example, DOC, peat temperature at 5 cm depth (T-5), and water table depth (WTD) jointly explained 53% of the temporal variance in the log-transformed CH4 flux for the hollows. Also, DOC was observed to be significantly correlated with the log-transformed CH4 flux for each land form. After the data were split into wet and dry seasons based on the water table, we observed that the T-5 was the main driver of the CH4 flux during the wet season (R-2 = 0.13), while VVTD replaced it during the dry season (R-2 = 0.23) for the general peatland system (i.e., all plots taken together). For the hummocks, both and WTD together explained 31% of the variance in the log-transformed CH4 flux during the wet season, and peat temperature at 20 cm depth explained 16% of the variance in the log-transformed CH4 flux during the dry season, while neither T-5 nor WTD was correlated with the log-transformed CH4 flux across the whole season. These results imply that the relationships between environmental factors and CH4 flux depend on the water table and land forms. Our results indicate that water table drawdown is the main driver of the CH4 emission decrease at the non-inundated sites, and it explained 72% of the variance in seasonal mean CH4 emission among sites. The drainage ditches of the drained peatlands and the abandoned pasture, in spite of covering only 5% of the land area, contributed 15% and 32% of the CH4 emission of the land use type, respectively, and therefore represent a "hot spot" of CH4 emissions. High CH4 emission rates from the ditches, especially of the abandoned pasture, can be attributed to the higher production and export of DOC as a result of the rigorous vegetation growth. Spatially weighted CH4 emissions from May to October were 1.87 +/- 0.68 g CH4 m(-2) for the natural peatlands, 1.08 +/- 0.35 g CH4 m-2 for the drained peatlands, and 1.40 +/- 0.28 g CH4 m(-2) for the abandoned pasture. Our results suggest that it is critical to measure the CH4 emission from the drainage ditches, where fresher substrate with a higher quality is transferred from the vegetated portion of the drained peatlands, in order to accurately evaluate the effects of agricultural development on the CH4 emissions in boreal peatlands.

AB Root (diameter less than or equal to 10 mm) biomass and production was studied in three Scots pine stands growing on drained peatland sites of different fertility in southern Finland with the sequential coring method during three growing seasons. Both the living and dead root biomasses increased with a decrease in the fertility of the sites. Mean three-year annual Scots pine root production on the sites varied between 65-112 g m(-2) calculated by balancing transfers in the statistically significant changes in monthly living and dead root biomasses, and between 221-309 g m(-2), in the case where all changes were accounted. The field layer root production for the sites was 36-156 g m(-2) and 180-279 g m(-2), respectively. Scots pine root production was somewhat greater on the nutrient poor site than on the other sites, whereas the field layer root production was greater on the richer sites. However, the differences in root production between the sites were not statistically significant due to the high variation. Scots pine root turnover did not vary between sites, whereas, that of the field layer was greater on the richer sites and also greater than that of Scots pine roots. The results also indicate that root production is positively affected by soil temperature and soil aeration on drained peatlands.

AB Background: Restoration aims at reversing the trend of habitat degradation, the major threat to biodiversity. In Finland, more than half of the original peatland area has been drained, and during recent years, restoration of some of the drained peatlands has been accomplished. Short-term effects of the restoration on peatland hydrology, chemistry and vegetation are promising but little is known about how other species groups apart from vascular plants and bryophytes respond to restoration efforts.
   Results: Here, we studied how abundance and species richness of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) respond to restoration. We sampled larvae in three sites (restored, drained, pristine) on each of 12 different study areas. We sampled Odonata larvae before restoration (n = 12), during the first (n = 10) and the third (n = 7) year after restoration and used generalized linear mixed models to analyze the effect of restoration. Drained sites had lower abundance and species richness than pristine sites. During the third year after restoration both abundance and species richness had risen in restored sites.
   Conclusions: Our results show that Odonata suffer from drainage, but seem to benefit from peatland restoration and are able to colonize newly formed water pools already within three years after restoration.

AB The total area of boreal peatlands is about 3.5 million km(2) and they are estimated to contain 15-30% of the global soil carbon (C) storage. In Finland, about 60 000 km(2), or 60% of the original peatland area, has been drained, mainly for forestry improvement. We have studied C inventory changes on forestry-drained peatlands by re-sampling the peat stratum in 2009 at the precise locations of quantitative peat mass analyses conducted as part of peatland transect surveys during the 1980s. The old and new profiles were correlated mainly by their ignition residue stratigraphies; at each site we determined a reference level, identifiable in both profiles, and calculated the cumulative dry mass and C inventories above it. Comparison of a total of 37 locations revealed broad variation, from slight increase to marked decrease; on average the 2009 results indicate a loss of 7.4 (SE +/- 2.5) kg m(-2) dry peat mass when compared with the 1980s values. Expressed on an annual basis, the results indicate an average net loss of 150 g C m(-2) year(-1) from the soil of drained forestry peatlands in the central parts of Finland. The C balance appeared not to correlate with site fertility (fertility classes according to original vegetation type), nor with post-drainage timber growth.

AB Altering the hydrothermic regime of drained low-moor peat soils by applying different doses of sand (covering and mixed systems) intensifies their biological activity within the upper l-m-thick layer, compared to traditional management. This is accompanied by a sharp rise in cellulose decomposition, proteolytic activity, the production of carbon dioxide, and the accumulation of free amino acids. Sand application increases the loss of peat organic matter by 18-28% via the CO2 emission from the soil surface to the atmosphere, The measures on the conservation of organic matter in peat soils and control of degradation are discussed.

AB An increase in extreme weather events is predicted with increasing climate changes. Changes indicate major problems in the future, as Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) is one of the most important forestry species in Northern Europe and one of the most susceptible to damage from extreme weather events, like windstorms. Root architecture is essential for tree anchorage. However, information of structural root-plate volume and characteristics in relation to tree wind resistance in drained deep peat soils is lacking. Individual tree susceptibility to wind damage is dependent on tree species, soil properties, tree health and root-plate volume. We assessed the structural root-plate dimensions of wind-thrown Norway spruce on freely drained mineral and drained deep peat soils at four trial sites in Latvia, and root-plate measurements were made on 65 recently tipped-up trees and 36 trees from tree-pulling tests on similar soils. Tree height, diameter at breast height, root-plate width and depth were measured. Measurements of structural root-plate width were done in five directions covering 180 degrees of the root-plate; rooting depth was measured on the horizontal and vertical axes of root-plate. Root-plate volume was higher in drained peat soils in comparison to mineral soils, and root-plate width was the main driver of root-plate volume. A decreasing trend was observed in structural root depth distribution with increasing distance from the stem (i.e., from the center to the edge of the root plate) with a greater decrease in mineral soils.

AB yThe hydrology of subarctic, discontinuous permafrost regions is sensitive to the effects of climatic warming, because pronounced changes in water storage and runoff pathways could occur with small additional ground heating. The objective of this study is to understand the hydrologic functions of unique land-cover types in this region (channel fens, flat bogs, and peat plateaus) using isotopic and chemical signatures of surface and subsurface water, as well as hydrometric measurements. The study was conducted in a 152-km(2) basin of Scotty Creek, located in the central part of the Mckenzie River basin in northern Canada. The headwater of Scotty Creek, Goose Lake had a strongly enriched isotopic composition due to evaporation. The stream water composition changed downstream, as the lateral drainage from the active layer of peat plateaus contributed isotopically light and chemically dilute water to channel fens that are part of the drainage network. flat bogs received drainage from peat plateau in addition to direct precipitation, and were internally drained or drained water to adjacent channel fens. Average evapotranspiration estimated from the chloride-balance method was 280-300 mm/yr, which was consistent with the hydrometric estimate (precipitation minus runoff) of 275 mm/yr indicating a potential applicability of this method to ungauged basins. Tracer-based hydrograph separation showed that the direct snowmelt contribution to spring runoff was less than half of total discharge, suggesting an importance of the water stored over winter in lakes and wetlands. The total amount of water stored over winter in the basin was estimated to be 140-240 mm, which was comparable to the average annual basin discharge (149 mm). (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Multilevel logistic regression models were constructed to predict the 5-year mortality of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and pubescent birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) growing in drained peatland stands in northern and central Finland. Data concerning tree mortality were obtained from two successive measurements of the National Forest Inventory-based permanent sample plot data base covering pure and mixed stands of Scots pine and pubescent birch. In the modeling data, Scots pine showed an average observed mortality of 2.73% compared to 2.98% for pubescent birch. In the,model construction, stepwise logistic regression and multilevel models methods were applied, the latter making it possible to address the hierarchical data, thus obtaining unbiased estimates for model parameters. For both species, mortality was explained by tree size, competitive position, stand density, species admixture, and site quality. The expected need for ditch network maintenance or re-paludification did not influence mortality. The multilevel models showed the lowest bias in the modeling data. The models were further validated against independent test data and by embedding them in a stand simulator. In 100-year simulations with different initial stand conditions, the models resulted in a 72% and 66% higher total mortality rate for the stem numbers of pine and birch, respectively, compared to previously used mortality models. The developed models are expected to improve the accuracy of stand forecasts in drained peatland sites.

AB Methane fluxes were studied at two high-elevation oligotrophic peat bogs in the Ore Mts., Czech Republic. The Bukova dolina Bog was drained 15 years ago and 2 years ago was partly restored, whereas the Brumiste Bog is an intact peatland. Draining led to a change of vegetation structure, dominated by Molinia caerulea, Carex sp., and forestation by Norway spruce. Methane fluxes were measured monthly from April to November 2011 using a closed chamber. Temperature and presence of Carex were significant controls on methane fluxes. Peat depth, water table and the presence of other plant species had no significant effect on CH4 emissions. Methane emissions ranged from 9 to 2700 mg/m(2)/day at the degraded and from 3 to 260 mg/m(2)/day at the intact bog. In general, the degraded peat bog emitted three times more methane compared to the intact peat bog, likely due to vegetation changes after long-term artificial draining.

AB Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is one of the most important auxin/phytohormones for plant growth. The effect of peat botanical composition of various vegetation cover and peat-forming species at 13 sampling points located in fens, bogs and drained peatlands on the content of IAA, hot water extractable organic carbon (C-HWE), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and C/N quotient was assessed. The objective of this study was to analyse comparatively the quantities of IAA, TOC, C-HWE, TN and C/N in peats of varying genesis with respect to the peculiarities of their origin due to the botanical composition of vegetation cover and peat-forming species. A high content of IAA, C-HWE and TN was found in the top layers of the peatlands, indicating the formation of IAA mainly by the roots of peat-forming species and rhizosphere bacteria, because of the rich supplies of chemical and biochemical compounds exuded from the roots. Drainage of the peatlands did not have a significant effect on the amounts of IAA and TOC, but contributed to the release of large amounts of C-HWE (mainly representative of labile carbon). High TOC contents and C/N quotients in deeper layers of the peat deposits indicated a decline in the rate of soil organic matter (SOM) mineralisation and accumulation of the recalcitrant fraction. Varying C/N quotients of peat-forming species may reflect the initial botanical composition of the vegetation cover or peat-forming species, or differences in the degree of decomposition and/or TN content of the peats.

AB Drained peatlands are hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which could be mitigated by rewetting and land use change. We performed an ecological/economic analysis of rewetting drained fertile peatlands in a hemiboreal climate using different land use strategies over 80 years. Vegetation, soil processes, and total GHG emissions were modeled using the CoupModel for four scenarios: (1) business as usualNorway spruce with average soil water table of -40 cm; (2) willow with groundwater at -20 cm; (3) reed canary grass with groundwater at -10 cm; and (4) a fully rewetted peatland. The predictions were based on previous model calibrations with several high-resolution datasets consisting of water, heat, carbon, and nitrogen cycling. Spruce growth was calibrated by tree-ring data that extended the time period covered. The GHG balance of four scenarios, including vegetation and soil, were 4.7, 7.1, 9.1, and 6.2 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. The total soil emissions (including litter and peat respiration CO2 + N2O + CH4) were 33.1, 19.3, 15.3, and 11.0 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1), respectively, of which the peat loss contributed 35%, 24%, and 7% of the soil emissions for the three drained scenarios, respectively. No peat was lost for the wet peatland. It was also found that draining increases vegetation growth, but not as drastically as peat respiration does. The cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is sensitive to time frame, discount rate, and carbon price. Our results indicate that the net benefit was greater with a somewhat higher soil water table and when the peatland was vegetated with willow and reed canary grass (Scenarios 2 and 3). We conclude that saving peat and avoiding methane release using fairly wet conditions can significantly reduce GHG emissions, and that this strategy should be considered for land use planning and policy-making.

   The objective of this study was to evaluate natural forest regeneration in cutovers on drained fens (eutrophic and mesotrophic low moor peat soils) depending on intensity of drainage characterised by depth of the ground water table, coverage of ground by vegetation and soil chemical properties (soil acidity and saturation with bases). The data were collected in 172 sample plots established in transects located perpendicular to drainage ditches at different distance to it. The assessments were carried out in 2003-2007 in the Panevezys and Birzai state forest enterprises.
   It was found that downy birch (Betula pubescens) seedlings dominated in cutovers on eutrophic and mesotrophic fens. The density of seedlings was greatest (3,700-5,300 trees per ha) on undrained and extensively drained cutovers where ground water table depth (h(5)) at the beginning of growth period was 1-20 cm. Black alder (Alnus glutinosa) seedlings were most abundant (1,000-1,300 trees per ha) in undrained and extensively drained cutovers on eutrophic peatlands where ground water level at the beginning of growth period is above the soil surface (10 cm) or near it (in the depth of 1-10 cm). Spruce (Picea abies) seedlings were not abundant (averaged 300 101 trees per ha) in these sites. The higher density of spruce seedlings was found (more than 300 trees per ha) in drained cutovers (h(5) = 10-80 cm) on mesotrophic peatlands.
   It was found that the average density of seedlings of trees in cutovers on fens (eutrophic peatlands) depended significantly on the depth of the ground water table, coverage of ground vegetation and acidity of soils.It was concluded that overly intensive drainage of fens (lowering ground water table at the beginning of the growth period of trees by more than 30-40 cm) created unfavourable conditions for regeneration of trees, decreased the base saturation of soil, increased soil acidity and reduced soil fertility.

SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The study presents a way of adjusting the prediction of a spatial single tree growth model on the basis of the adverse effect of ground water.  The spatial distribution of growth resources is described by the depth of the groundwater table and the competition from neighbouring trees.  The competition is described by a spatial growth model made for mineral soils.  The depth of the groundwater table is calculated from the local stand volume and the distance from the nearest ditch.
   The effect of the spatial pattern of trees on the growth of a 25-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand growing on a drained peatland was studied using the simulation model.  Heavy clustering of trees decreased the volume growth by 5-13% compared with a regular spatial distribution.  Between-tree variation in diameter growth was smallest and the volume growth best when the stand density was about three times higher on the ditch border than in the middle of two adjacent ditches.

AB Quantification of fine root biomass is needed for estimating the role of roots as carbon (C) stores and sources of C input into the soil, as well as for modelling of forest nutrient cycling. Due to the laborious nature of root biomass determinations, there is a need to develop indirect methods that would allow fine root biomass to be estimated using data on easily measurable stand and site variables. We developed models for estimating tree fine root (diameter <= 2 mm) biomass of boreal forests by compiling data from 95 Finnish forest stands (55 on upland soils and 40 on drained peatlands). Stand basal area predicted fine root biomass (R-2-adj. = 0.35, p < 0.001) better than any other stand variable alone. A model that included stand basal area, dominant tree species group [birch/other], soil type [upland soil/drained peatland], temperature sum and the interaction of soil type and temperature sum accounted for 46% of the variation in fine root biomass. Stand basal area, the C:N ratio of the organic layer or upper 0-20 cm peat layer and the dominant tree species group together explained 45% of the variation in fine root biomass. Temperature sum correlated with fine root biomass in opposite ways in upland soils and in drained peatlands: fine root biomass increased with decreasing temperature sum in upland soil sites, whereas in peatlands fine root biomass decreased as the temperature sum decreased. Although the models were based on a large dataset representing well the variation in stand age, basal area, site fertility and climatic conditions in northern European boreal forests, half of the variation in fine root biomass remained unexplained. More comprehensive fine root biomass sampling in relation to spatial and temporal variation in the forthcoming studies, for example in connection with monitoring campaigns, and additional predictors such as soil texture, successional stage and the fine root biomass of ground vegetation might improve the predictive power of fine root biomass models.

AB Drainage for forestry has been amongst the most extensive of land management practices applied to northern latitude peatlands, particularly in northern Europe. Extracellular phenol oxidases play an important role in the carbon cycle of soils. This study investigated the effects of long-term (45 years) drainage for forestry upon surface peat extracellular phenol oxidase activity, soluble phenolic concentrations and pH at ombrotrophic bog, oligotrophic fen and mesotrophic fen sites at a Finnish mire complex. Phenol oxidase activity was reduced by drainage at all three sites. Phenol oxidase activity was positively correlated with peat pH across all sites irrespective of drainage treatment, suggesting that pH is a major factor influencing peat phenol oxidase activity at the mire complex. Peat pH became more acidic with drainage at the fen sites, and it is likely that this contributed to the suppression of peat phenol oxidase activity. The reduction of peat phenol oxidase activity with drainage was accompanied by increased concentrations of water-soluble phenolics at all three sites, and the potential contribution of this to changes in peat carbon stocks following drainage is discussed.

ID NORTHERN PEATLANDS; WATER-TABLE; WETLANDS; FLUXES
AB Methane (CH4) fluxes from drainage ditches and adjoining strips between the ditches were measured in fall 1995 at a drained mire in Finland. The fluxes were measured at different mire sites using static chambers (diffusion and plant-mediated transport) and inverted funnels (ebullition). The emissions (chamber measurements) of CH4 from drainage ditch bottoms, ditch sides, and strips between ditches ranged from 0 to 595 mg.m(-2).d(-1), from 0 to 78 mg.m(-2).d(-1), and from -3 to 33 mg.m(-2).d(-1), respectively. The ebullition of CH4 from ditches was rather small, ranging from 3 to 37 mg CH4.m(-2).d(-1), which was less than 10% of the CH4 flux measured by the chambers. As the proportion of ditches of the total peatland area is rather small, the inclusion of methane fluxes from ditches would not considerably change the previous estimates of the effect of drainage on the greenhouse gas balance of Finnish peatlands.

AB In the boreal and temperate zones about 15 million hectares of peatlands and wetlands have been drained for forestry purposes and a large number of these forests are now approaching their commercial thinning or regeneration age. One of the major concerns raised in connection with an increased harvesting of drained peatland forests is the deterioration of the downstream water quality due to an enhanced nutrient transport. Harvest residues left on the site are a potential high source of nutrients to recipient water bodies and both increased N and P exports have been reported after conventional stem-only clear-cutting. We studied the decomposition of Picea abies and Pin us sylvestris harvest residue needles at two clear-cut areas and two uncut forested areas on drained peatlands at two locations in southern Finland. Our results indicated that P is easily released from harvest residue needles. After the first three growing seasons, spruce and pine needles had lost approximately 31% and 47% of their initial P contents, respectively. There was no clear gain or loss of nitrogen. Most of the heavy metals accumulated in the needles as the decomposition process proceeded, especially at the more southern study location near the heavily industrialized Helsinki capital area with high atmospheric deposition. The conclusion is that harvest residue needles are not a likely source of the increased N export that has been observed to occur from peat soils soon after clear-cutting, but that P release from harvest residues may be a cause for the reported high P losses.

Generally, the N and P stores in a 0 - 50 cm peat layer increased with increasing drainage age in oligo-ombrotrophic sites, and remained unchanged in meso-oligotrophic sites, even if large quantities were bound up in the increasing tree stand biomasses. This was mainly caused by post-drainage subsidence of the mire surface and the consequent compaction, which increased the peat bulk densities and brought new stores from deeper peat layers into the layer under observation. Measured stand volumes and published values for N and P concentrations of tree stand compartments were used to estimate the amounts of N and P bound up in the tree stands. The estimates of N and P in the tree stands of the oldest drainage areas were considerable (ca. 400 kg N and 40 kg P ha-1 in the meso-oligotrophic and ca. 300 kg N and 30 kg P ha-1 in the oligo-ombrotrophic sites), but were small when compared to the stores in the peat (ca. 10 000 kg N and 400 kg P ha-1 in the meso-oligotrophic and ca. 7000 kg N and 300 kg P ha-1 in the oligo-ombrotrophic sites in the 0-50 cm layer).

AB Restoration of peatlands has been found to mitigate eutrophication due to the high and long-term capacity of peatlands to reduce nitrate (NO3-) fluxes. However, altered peat composition and/or contamination of the water used for rewetting can promote the release of dissolved substances, resulting in serious biogeochemical constraints on achievement of restoration goals. Elevated dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release can alter the turnover of organic matter in rewetted fens and adjacent aquatic ecosystems. Increasing availability of soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) can significantly elevate primary productivity, stimulating eutrophication and associated problems. We conducted a laboratory study to evaluate the effect of rewetting long-term drained fens with NO3- polluted water on DOC and SRP release. The effects of peat decomposition, NO3- loading rate and temperature were considered. Different peat substrates from one degraded, drained fen in northeast Germany were incubated under stagnant, inundated conditions. Two levels of peat decomposition (high and moderate), two NO3- loads (40 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) and 140 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) and two incubation temperatures (20 degrees C and 5 degrees C) were studied. Peat types were characterized by means of a sequential chemical extraction procedure to estimate the size of the DOC and SRP mobile pools. It was shown that peat decomposition controlled SRP and DOC release due to significant differences in mobile C and P pools. Low temperature slowed the rates of microbiologically mediated processes involved in SRP and DOC turnover. To some extent, the effect of temperature modified the effect of peat decomposition. Due to complete NO3- removal at the peat surface layer (<1 cm), NO3- load did not influence SRP and DOC production in the peat, but did impact their release at the peat-water interface. Our study found that when highly decomposed peat is incubated at 20 degrees C under low nitrate conditions, a substantial amount of DOC is released. Similarly, SRP release only occurred under those same conditions. Results from our experiments provide insight into the potential release of DOC and SRP that could occur in rewetted fens.

AB Succession of woody species on bogs is a process limited by high groundwater table. In the case of drainage, this limiting factor becomes suppressed and succession may accelerate. The aim of the study was to assess the development of tree stands on a raised bog influenced by drainage and wild fire and to assess the dynamics of woody species encroachment. The study was conducted in the 'Brzozowe Bagno kolo Czaplinka' nature reserve in NW Poland, where the originally unforested peat bog was influenced by peat harvesting, drainage and fire over 100 years. The diameter at breast height of tree species and natural regeneration were assessed. Six types of tree stands were distinguished: open bog, bog forest with Pinus sylvestris, early-, mid- and late-successional bog forest with Betula pubescens and pioneer forest with Populus tremula, which occurred in the post-fire sites. After ca 100 years of human activity on an unforested peat bog, dense forest emerged on almost all of the study area. Drainage and wildfire influenced tree stand structure. The course of succession most probably goes from open bog to pine bog forest and early-, mid- and late-successional birch forests. Regeneration of B. pubescens is a crucial phase of woody species succession, because this species creates suitable conditions for growth of late-successional species.

AB The restoration of peatlands is an important strategy to counteract subsidence and loss of biodiversity. However, responses of important microbial soil processes are poorly understood. We assessed functioning, diversity and spatial organization of methanotrophic communities in drained and rewetted peat meadows with different water table management and agricultural practice. Results show that the methanotrophic diversity was similar between drained and rewetted sites with a remarkable dominance of the genus Methylocystis. Enzyme kinetics depicted no major differences, indicating flexibility in the methane (CH4) concentrations that can be used by the methanotrophic community. Short-term flooding led to temporary elevated CH4 emission but to neither major changes in abundances of methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) nor major changes in CH4 consumption kinetics in drained agriculturally used peat meadows. Radiolabeling and autoradiographic imaging of intact soil cores revealed a markedly different spatial arrangement of the CH4 consuming zone in cores exposed to near-atmospheric and elevated CH4. The observed spatial patterns of CH4 consumption in drained peat meadows with and without short-term flooding highlighted the spatial complexity and responsiveness of the CH4 consuming zone upon environmental change. The methanotrophic microbial community is not generally altered and harbors MOB that can cover a large range of CH4 concentrations offered due to water-table fluctuations, effectively mitigating CH4 emissions.

AB Maintaining and improving surface water quality requires knowledge of nutrient and sediment loads due to past and future land-use practices, but historical data on land cover and its changes are often lacking. In this study, we tested whether land-use-specific export coefficients can be used together with satellite images (Landsat) and/or regional land-use statistics to estimate riverine nutrient loads and concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and suspended solids (SS). The study area, Simojoki (3160 km(2)) in northern Finland, has been intensively drained for peatland forestry since the 1960s. We used different approaches at multiple sub catchment scales to simulate TN, TP, and SS export in the Simojoki catchment. The uncertainty in estimates based on specific export coefficients was quantified based on historical land-use changes (derived from Landsat data), and an uncertainty boundary was established for each land-use. The uncertainty boundary captured at least 60% of measured values of TN, TP, and SS loads or concentrations. However, the uncertainty in estimates compared with measured values ranged from 7% to 20% for TN, 0% to 18% for TP, and 13% to 43% for SS for different catchments. Some discrepancy between predicted and measured loads and concentrations was expected, as the method did not account for inter-annual variability in hydrological conditions or river processes. However, combining historical land-use change estimates with simple export coefficients can be a practical approach for evaluating the influence on water quality of historical land-use changes such as peatland drainage for forest establishment.

Silva Fennica 46(5): 695-705. A large proportion of drained spruce mire stands is currently approaching regeneration maturity in Finland. We studied the effect of cutting - small canopy openings (78, 177, and 314 m(2)) and small clear-cuts (0.25-0.37 ha) - with or without site preparation (scalping) on the establishment of natural Norway spruce seedlings in one experimental drained spruce mire stand in northern Finland. The cuttings were made in winter 2004-2005 and site preparation with scalping in early June 2005. The experimental design was composed of four blocks with altogether four clear-cuts and 33 canopy openings. The seedling establishment was surveyed annually (2006, 2008-2010) from five circular sample plots (one 10 m(2) and four 5 m(2) plots in size) located within the canopy openings and from 18 circular 5 m(2) sample plots systematically located in the scalped and untreated halves of the clear-cuts. Site preparation was found unnecessary, because it resulted in a clearly lower number of seedlings in the openings. A slight negative effect was also found in the clear-cuts. In the two years following the cuttings, the number of seedlings increased quickly in the canopy openings, but more gradually in the clear-cut areas. In 2010, on average 15 500 new seedlings were observed in the canopy openings and 6700 in the clear-cut areas, of which 5050 and 1200, respectively, were > 0.1 m tall spruces. The proportion of birch increased in the last two years, being ca. 22% in the openings and 45% in the clear-cuts in 2010. The spatial distribution of seedlings was more uneven in the clear-cuts than in the openings, with 41% and 20% of survey plots empty, respectively.

AB The ability of peatlands to remove and store atmospheric carbon (C) depends on the drainage characteristics, which can be challenging to accommodate in biogeochemical models. Many studies indicate that restoration (by rewetting) of damaged peatlands can re-establish their capacity as a natural C sink. The purpose of this research was to improve the biogeochemical modelling of peatlands using the ECOSSE process-based model, which will account for the effects of drainage and rewetting during simulation, and potentially contribute towards improved estimation of carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from peatlands, using the IPCC Tier 3 approach. In this study, we present a new drainage factor with seasonal variability Dfa (i) developed specifically for ECOSSE, using empirical data from two drained and rewetted Irish peatlands. Dfa(i) was developed from the Blackwater drained bare-peat site (BWdr), and its application was tested at the vegetated Moyarwood peatland site under drained (MOdr) and rewetted conditions (MOrw). Dfa(i) was applied to the rainfall model inputs for the periods of active drainage in conjunction with the measured water table (WT) inputs. The results indicate that Dfa(i) application can improve the model performance to predict model-estimated water level (WL) and CO2 fluxes under drained conditions [WL: r(2) = 0.89 (BWdr) and 0.94 (Modr); CO2: r(2) = 0.66 (BWdr) and 0.78 (MOdr)] along with model-ability to capture their seasonal trends. The prediction of WL for the rewetted period was less successful at the MOrw site, where the simulation was run for drained to rewetted, which would suggest that additional work on the water model component is still needed. Despite this, the application of Dfa(i) showed successful model simulation of CO2 fluxes at MOrw (r(2) = 0.75) and model ability to capture seasonal trends. This work hopes to positively contribute towards potential future development of Tier 3 methodology for estimating emissions/sinks in peatlands. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Drained peat soils are important sources of greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide (NA)), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases are produced in soil and they can be emitted year-round. We measured N2O and CH4 flux rates and total respiration (R-TOT) over a year from a drained peatland with one subsite as a grass field and another forested. The field acted annually as a small source (0.36 +/- 0.73 kg C.ha(-1)) and the forest as a sink (-1.93 +/- 0.50 kg C.ha(-1)) for CH4. Mean annual R-TOT rates were 660 and 297 mg.m(-2).h(-1) in the field and in the forest, respectively. Annual N2O emission rates were 34.8 +/- 2.4 kg N.ha(-1) from the field and 25.5 +/- 5.5 kg N-ha(-1) from the forest. More than 80% of the annual N2O emissions took place during winter. In the field, high emissions were detected during thawing in April when N2O accumulated in soil during the winter was released. In the forest, N2O emissions peaked when the top soil was freezing in January and accumulation of N2O in soil was less than in the field. The timing of the episodic high N2O emissions thus differed depending on the land use.

ID PEAT
AB Sphagnum farming provides an alternative to detrimental peatland drainage in two ways. Firstly, Sphagnum mosses are cultivated on rewetted peatlands. Secondly, Sphagnum biomass is a high-quality growing media constituent suitable for replacing peat in horticulture. This study investigated the shift from drained bog grassland to a wet Sphagnum farming site from the micro-economic perspective. Based on five years of field experience, we calculated costs and revenues of Sphagnum farming for a total cultivation time of 20 years. Sensitivity analysis encompassed costs, yields, prices and the effect of public non-market payments. We found that cultivated Sphagnum biomass could not compete with peat at current market prices, whereas its use for orchid cultivation was economically viable in the case of medium to high Sphagnum productivity. Selling Sphagnum shoots as founder or "seeding" material was profitable even in pessimistic scenarios with high costs and low yields. Cost-covering prices for Sphagnum biomass substituting peat seem achievable, if end consumers pay a surcharge of 10 % for plants cultivated without using peat (peat free). A commercial-scale implementation, an increasing market demand for renewables, and setting climate targets for the agricultural and horticultural sectors will accelerate the development of Sphagnum farming as a profitable alternative to drainage-based peatland agriculture and peat extraction.

AB This study investigated the changes caused by management, including drainage and thinnings, in peatland forest stand structure. Drained peatland sites in Finnish North Karelia were compared within the same type groups and nutrient status levels of virgin peatlands in the Republic of Karelia, the Russian Federation. The Variables studied, which depict stand structure variation, included: (1) the diameter of the median tree; (2) the range of sampled diameters; (3) the basal area of the stand; (4) the estimated number of tree storeys; and (5) the number of the tree species. The number of tree storeys was determined through non-parametric Kernel estimation.
   Over a long duration, management smooths the natural multi-modal structure of virgin peatland stocking by decreasing the variation in size-distribution. Management also changes the natural tree species dynamics on peatland sites by providing a competitive advantage to the tree species, which adjust best to the changed growing conditions. These species begin to dominate the habitat and reduce the species diversity. The effect of recent thinnings and cleaning cuttings on the forest structure is dependent upon fertility of the site and the stage of the forest stock at the moment of silvicultural operation. Cleaning cuttings may have also an increasing effect on the structural diversity of peatland forest stand. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Drained peatlands are significant sources of the greenhouse gas (GHG) carbon dioxide. Rewetting is a proven strategy used to protect carbon stocks; however, it can lead to increased emissions of the potent GHG methane. The response to rewetting of soil microbiomes as drivers of these processes is poorly understood, as are the biotic and abiotic factors that control community composition. We analyzed the pro- and eukaryotic microbiomes of three contrasting pairs of minerotrophic fens subject to decade-long drainage and subsequent long-term rewetting. Abiotic soil properties including moisture, dissolved organic matter, methane fluxes, and ecosystem respiration rates were also determined. The composition of the microbiomes was fen-type-specific, but all rewetted sites showed higher abundances of anaerobic taxa compared to drained sites. Based on multi-variate statistics and network analyses, we identified soil moisture as a major driver of community composition. Furthermore, salinity drove the separation between coastal and freshwater fen communities. Methanogens were more than 10-fold more abundant in rewetted than in drained sites, while their abundance was lowest in the coastal fen, likely due to competition with sulfate reducers. The microbiome compositions were reflected in methane fluxes from the sites. Our results shed light on the factors that structure fen microbiomes via environmental filtering.

AB Runoff generation and fluxes of dissolved elements were studied in two drained peatlands under different land uses during spring snowmelt 2012. One site experienced soil frost, whereas the other site was frost-free due to groundwater seepage. Runoff water was sampled at 12-hour intervals during the snowmelt peak and soil and snow samples were taken. All samples were analysed for oxygen-18 isotope and various water quality parameters. The results demonstrated the effect of soil frost on water flow paths, which further affected runoff water quality. At the frost-free site, seepage through the peat soil profile was the main flow route during snowmelt runoff generation, which could be seen e.g., as high DOC concentration in the stream. At the site with soil frost, meltwater could not infiltrate into the soil, leading to overland flow and lower concentrations of elements in water during the peak snowmelt period.

AB The short-term effects of N addition on CH4 oxidation in a drained peat soil were investigated by incubation of peat material from fertilized and unfertilized plots in the laboratory. CH4 oxidation was observed only in the surface depth interval (0-5 cm) of the peat profile. Rate constants as high as -0.084 h(-1) g(-1)d.w. were measured. Fertilization affected the magnitude of the reaction rate constants with the greatest inhibition observed in those samples that were amended with NH4Cl. KNO3 and urea addition resulted in less inhibition. A weak temperature effect on CH4 consumption was observed. Apparent activation energies (E(a)' were measured at - 54 to - 16 kJ mol(-1). Only the addition of KNO3 significantly affected the temperature response of the surface peats. The nitrogen fertilizers had also decreased the CH4 uptake in situ. However, our study showed that the effect is not simply dependent upon NH4+ concentrations, e.g. the added salts, K+ and Cl-, might possibly contribute to the inhibitory effect.

AB The paper presents data on the growth of artificial pine young forests created on the drained transitional mire in the middle taiga subzone. The authors provide the study materials of 20-year research on the basis of experimental sites of the Forestry Research Institute of Karelian Research Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Cultures were established in 1972 on the territory of the Kindazovsky district forestry of the Pryazhinsky central forestry (the Republic of Karelia) in a mire drained 3 years before planting. Two-year-old standard seedlings of Scots pine grown in the open ground were used. The plant spacing was 0.6 m with a total initial density of crops of 4.0 ... 4.5 ths pcs/ha. A pine and birch stand was formed by the age of 20 years. At the age of 20 to 40 years, cultures were studied according to the standard methods adopted in the taxation. Cultivation of pine cultures on drained poor transitional mires had proved to be a highly effective measure in the context of forestry. High-density young growths with productivity at least equal to the third yield class were formed on the forest cultures sites. The conservation of cultures was high. At the age of 20-25 years, this indicator was from 65 to 75 %. In the future, as the height of crops increased, the attrition of seedlings intensified, and by the age of 40, the conservation declined to 35 ... 45 %. At the initial density of planting 4.0 ... 4.5 ths pcs/ha there was a sufficient number of stems on the area to form a full-fledged stand in the future. According to the size categories at the age of 40, the trees were classified as small (56 ... 78 %) and medium (22 ... 45 %). Thus, the tree stand formed on the forest plantation site can be characterized not only by high productivity, but also by good quality.

AB To understand the global carbon cycle and the impact of human activity on climate, it is necessary to quantify the net CO2 exchange of ecosystems in different land uses on a large scale. Methods to estimate soil net CO2 exchange (NECO2soil) for drained peatland forests have been largely based on chamber measurements and statistical models. The uncertainty in these methods has not been assessed. Yet, disturbed organic soils are a globally important, potential CO2 source due to their vast carbon storage and its sensitivity to changes in soil moisture.
   In this study, we estimated the countrywide NECO2soil for the 4.76 million ha of forestry-drained peat soils in Finland. We gathered available litter production and CO2 efflux data and constructed models to be used for the upscaling of NECO2soil from forest inventory data. The contribution of each model and the inventory sampling to the precision of the countrywide estimate was calculated. Also, the sensitivity to possible bias in selected model components was estimated.
   Compared to the estimated mean NECO2soil, ranging from a source of +20 g m(-2) year(-1) of C to a sink of -40 g m(-2) year(-1) of C, the uncertainty was high. The precision of the estimate (+/- 1 standard deviation) was +/- 20 g m(-2) year(-1) of C. Due to possible bias in the estimated belowground litter input, the overall uncertainty was much higher, around 60 g m(-2) year(-1) of C.
   The main reason for the high relative uncertainty was NECO2soil being on average close to zero in these boreal forestry-drained peatlands. Forest inventory sample size was large enough and the data for the models were mainly sufficient. To reduce the uncertainty, better understanding of belowground carbon fluxes in order to accurately determine the C input to soil, is crucial. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study assessed the risk of decomposition-driven soil subsidence in drained peat soils in the Netherlands, contrasting in peat origin and current land use. In a full factorial design, fen peat and bog peat were sampled from sites in use for nature conservation and for dairy farming, which contrast in history of drainage and fertilisation. In these four peat types, which frequently occur in the Netherlands, the microbial activity and respiration dynamics were studied in samples from superficial oxic peat layers by measuring Substrate Induced Respiration (SIR) and Substrate Induced Growth Response (SIGR). Total and active microbial biomass, microbial growth potential and potential exo-enzyme activities were determined in unamended samples and after nitrogen and/or glucose amendments.
   Remarkably, peat origin and land use did not affect basal respiration rates. In contrast, land use affected microbial biomass and potential growth rates as they were quadrupled in dairy meadows compared to nature reserves. This may be attributable to the pulses of organic and inorganic fertiliser that are being supplied in agricultural peatlands. Potential activities of oxidative exo-enzymes (phenol oxidase, PDX, and phenol peroxidase, POD), in contrast, depended more on peat type, indicating a difference in peat substrate quality. Basal respiration rates and enzyme activities were not related. Phosphorus enrichment was identified as a potential driver of increased peat decomposition. The activity of the oxidative enzyme phenol oxidase and the concentration of phenolic compounds, which are considered to be the main regulators of peat decomposition according to the enzymic latch theory, were not related to respiration rates. It was concluded that decomposition theories like the enzymic latch theory (attributing a main role in the regulation of decomposition to phenolic compounds and phenol oxidase) were not supported by our research in the drained peat soils in the Netherlands.

AB We investigated the within-site distribution of Enchytraeidae, Collembola, Oribatida, Mesostigmata and Prostigmata relative to varying water level and substrate quality on pine mire sites forming a drainage succession continuum. Collembolans were most intolerant of wetness, favoring drier locations at all stages of the drainage succession. In general, the effect of water level variation on the within-site distribution of the soil fauna was strongest when the site was at an early stage of either progressive or regressive water level change. When the average water level was below 20 cm, it no longer had a significant effect on the distribution of mites, but still affected that of Enchytraeidae and Collembola. Boron was positively correlated with faunal density in several cases, and thus may be the growth limiting nutrient affecting substrate quality for decomposers in these sites. The overall changes in the soil mesofauna in drained peatlands depicted here show that these peatland forests are converging ecologically on upland forests where decomposition in general is much faster than in pristine peatlands. The change caused by restoration shows how labile these ecosystems are also with respect to the mesofaunal community. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Artificial drainage for agriculture causes the alteration of peatlands through excessive oxidation and fires. Peats lose their functions and also contribute to the release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. In this study, morphological, micro morphological and chemical soil characteristics of an artificially drained peat land located in the southern Turkey were investigated to assess the effects of excessive oxidation and fire. Soil samples described as sapric, hemic, or burnt were collected along four transects on the peatland. The results clearly indicated that burning process resulted in significant decrease in total carbon and nitrogen content of soils since 1950 whereas pH, ash content, available P and K contents were increased. Interpretations recognized as a degradation sequence after drainage. The results demonstrated that artificial drainage of peatlands for agricultural purposes leads to a change in organic soil properties. The carbon and nitrogen sink were depleted, C by about 2 x 10(6) and N by about 0.1 x 10(6) tons, and pH was raised above the level that is ideal for cropping, in a system that is not only completed changed but unsustainable without increasing soil inputs in the long term.

DE cut-away peatlands; Estonia; Finland; forest drainage; mires;

AB Environmental management of peatlands, landscape ecology and protection of key biotopes have created needs and pressure to restore drained peatlands to natural mire ecosystems. Here, we summarize different approaches and restoration techniques developed for peatland management in Estonia, Sweden, and Finland where peatlands are abundant. Without rewetting, plant colonisation on abandoned cut-away areas is slow due to harsh hydrological and microclimatic conditions. However, after restoration, cut-away peatlands may return to a functional state close to that of pristine mires, and therefore restore a net carbon sink function within a few years. In addition, restoration techniques can help to create buffer zones between terrestrial and limnic ecosystems that reduces the nutrient loading imposed on watercourses by forestry operations. Restoration may also be important for peatland conservation programs as drained peatlands are part of present and future conservation areas. Finally, restoration actions in themselves can have negative environmental impacts. For instance, inundation of peat surfaces resulting from the rewetting process often increases phosphorus leaching. Efforts on peatland restoration should focus on environmental monitoring, research on restoration and its environmental impact as well as public relations activities. In that respect, knowledge transfer between academics and managers should generate synergy benefits.

AB This study presents a new data synthesis of Finnish peatland area and carbon (C) store in peat from 1950 to 2015. We present updated results from the most comprehensive compilation of Finnish peat soil properties with associated C accumulation rates from undrained mires and C sources from different forms of anthropogenic land use. Since 1950, different forms of land use of Finnish peatlands have reduced the total peat C store by 3-10%, approximately 172-510 Tg. The most significant C losses have occurred from forestry-drained peatlands, but significant losses have also occurred from agricultural peat soils, peat extraction, and other forms of peatland exploitation such as building water reservoirs. However, the C accumulation of undrained mires and especially the increased biomass production of drained peatlands have partly compensated for the anthropogenic C losses. The total C store of peatland vegetation biomass (trees, seedlings, ground vegetation, detritus and below-ground roots) was estimated to have increased by 92 Tg due to intensive peatland drainage. The present total C store of Finnish peatland ecosystems was estimated at 5618 Tg, which includes 5079 Tg as peat. The total C store estimate is approximately 1-7 % lower compared to the 1950s. Today, the undrained mires still represent a significant national C sink, with the rate of C sequestration estimated at 0.82 Tg yr(-1). However, across all land uses the present peat soil is a C source by 3.7-10.0 Tg yr(-1). Significant anthropogenic C losses from peat soil underline the urgent need for sustainable C management of all peatlands, including the preservation of the C store in existing natural mires, stopping land clearing on undisturbed organic soils, and improving the peatland hydrology by restoration to create long-term C sinks especially within the large unproductive drainage area and northern aapa mire area.

AB Fertilizers are applied in drained peatland forests to correct nutrient imbalances, but few models have been developed for predicting the stand growth response. We used 10- to 34-year-long stem growth increment data from 51 fertilization experiments involving ash, PK, and NPK treatments (doses of P, K, and N varying between 35 and 45, 60 and 80, and 80 and 90 kg.ha(-1), respectively) and controls to model the volume growth response of young Scots pine (Pinus sylvetris L.) stands to fertilization in drained peatland sites of middle and northern Finland. We used the linear mixed models method to express the stand-level growth response as a function of time (5-year periods), site type group, location, and the fertilization treatment (ash-PK combined and NPK). Different growth responses were obtained for nitrogen-rich sites with PK treatment and nitrogen-poor sites with NPK treatment. The PK fertilization in nitrogen-rich sites resulted in the largest volume growth response and longest temporal effect (1.0-2.0 m(3).ha(-1).a(-1) higher mean growth for at least 35 years), with quicker and stronger effects in more southern conditions where average temperature sums were greater than 1000 degree-days (degrees C). NPK fertilization in nitrogen-poor sites gave a modest response (0.4-0.8 m(3).ha(-1).a(-1) in 35 years).

AB The dependence of nitrification in peat on pH was studied using aerobic incubation of samples from a drained minerotrophic fen in central Finland. In aerobic suspensions of the surface layer (0-5 cm) the nitrification rate was higher at pH 6 than at pH 4. Deeper in the profile (5-25 cm), nitrification was greater at pH 4 than at pH 6. However, storage of the homogenized peat material at 4 degrees C changed the relation of nitrification potential to pH. Inhibition of nitrification by acetylene was stronger at the pH that gave the higher nitrification rate. Thus, acetylene inhibited nitrification almost totally at pH 6 in the surface layer (97%) and at pH 4 in the deeper layers (95-100%). Only weak inhibition by acetylene (2.5 kPa) was observed at pH 4 in the surface layer (0-17%). At pH 6 in the deeper layers, acetylene did not inhibit nitrification at all.

AB Rewetted, previously drained fens often remain sources rather than sinks for carbon and nutrients. To date, it is poorly understood which soil characteristics stimulate carbon and nutrient mobilization upon rewetting. Here, we assess the hypothesis that a large pool of iron in the soil negatively affects fen restoration success, as flooding-induced iron reduction (Fe3+ to Fe2+) causes a disproportionate breakdown of organic matter that is coupled with a release of inorganic compounds. We collected intact soil cores in two iron-poor and two iron-rich drained fens, half of which were subjected to a rewetting treatment while the other half was kept drained. Prolonged drainage led to the mobilization of nitrate (NO3-, > 1 mmol L-1) in all cores, regardless of soil iron content. In the rewetted iron-rich cores, a sharp increase in pore water iron (Fe) concentrations correlated with concentrations of inorganic carbon (TIC, > 13 mmol L-1) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC, > 16 mmol L-1). Additionally, ammonium (NH4+) accumulated up to phytotoxic concentrations of 1 mmol L-1 in the pore water of the rewetted iron-rich cores. Disproportionate mobilization of Fe, TIC, DOC and NH4+ was absent in the rewetted iron-poor cores, indicating a strong interaction between waterlogging and iron-mediated breakdown of organic matter. Concentrations of dissolved phosphorus (P) rose slightly in all cores upon rewetting, but remained low throughout the experiment. Our results suggest that large pools of iron in the top soil of drained fens can hamper the restoration of the fen's sink-service for ammonium and carbon upon rewetting. We argue that negative effects of iron should be most apparent in fens with fluctuating water levels, as temporary oxygenation allows frequent regeneration of Fe3+. We conclude that rewetting of iron-poor fens may be more feasible for restoration.

AB New field techniques were developed and tested to evaluate peat storativity and hydraulic conductivity in a Boreal fen. Enclosed drainage tests and pumping tests were successfully completed in the thawed peat above an impermeable frozen layer and then repeated when the peat was fully thawed. A loading test experiment constrained values of vertical hydraulic conductivity within an order of magnitude for the peat below a depth of 2 m. An inherent advantage of these tests is that volumes of undisturbed peat on the scale of cubic metres may be characterized. Storativity of the fen peat as determined by enclosed drainage tests ranged from about 1.0 at the peat surface to 0.35 at a water table depth of 0.15 m. Laboratory drainage tests of peat cores gave similar, but widely scattered results. Hydraulic conductivity near the surface was as high as 9.0 x 10(-3) ms(-1) determined with pumping tests and in the range of 10(-6) to 10(-5) ms(-1) below a depth of 2 m, estimated with the loading test. Slug tests gave similar results. Pumping tests, enclosed storativity tests and loading tests are practical large-scale field tests for determining peat properties.

AB Question: Can the biodiversity of fens in Europe and North America be maintained through the use of grazing (especially cattle grazing), fire, and/or cutting?
   Location: European and North American fens.
   Methods: This paper is a review of the literature on the effects of grazing, fire and cutting on fens, to explore the relationship between management and biodiversity in fens.
   Results: A reduction of cattle grazing, mowing and burning in fens has led to a reduction in biodiversity in fens. The vegetation of abandoned fens shifts to trees and shrubs after 10-15 years, which shade the smaller and rarer species of these wetlands. While careful use of fire is used to manage fens in North America, it is not widely used in European fens, perhaps because the peat of drained fens may catch fire. Cattle grazing cannot be considered a natural disturbance in North America, since cattle did not evolve on that continent. In Europe, cattle do not generally graze in unaltered fens, but they do use slightly drained fen meadows.
   Conclusions: Three approaches have been used to control the dominance of tall woody and herbaceous species in abandoned fens, including the re-introduction of cattle, mowing, and burning. Overgrazing results in a permanent reduction in biodiversity, therefore cattle re-introduction must be approached cautiously. In Europe, but not in North America, mowing has been an important management tool, and mowing has been successful in maintaining species richness, particularly in fens that have been mowed annually for centuries. Fire has been the most common and successful management tool in North America although it is not effective in removing shrubs that have become large. Because the problems and solutions are similar, the literature of both European and North American fen management can be analyzed to better assess the management of fens on both continents. Many management questions require further study and these are listed in the paper.

AB Situated in the Campine region of Belgium, which is known for its thick sandy deposits and acid soils, the Buitengoor is a small headwater valley fen, containing many rich fen indicator species that are typical of neutral to alkaline soils. A hydrochemical survey of the surroundings of the fen pointed to an irrigation canal as a possible source of alkalinity for the fen. Just upstream of the fen, the alkaline canal water recharges the ground water. A piezometer transect from the canal to the fen illustrated the recharge pathway and the fate of alkalinity, cations and nutrients in the aquifer. Alkalinity and base cations are supplied to the fen while nutrients disappear out of solution. Although the normal hydroseral development of this fen would have been directed towards bog, the canal water caused an opposite development towards rich fen. This result illustrates the potential for groundwater flow systems to reverse peatland development in a short period of time (the canals were built in the last century). The potential for restoration of the rich fen habitat is discussed.

AB There is a limited understanding of the hydrological and microclimatic processes from drained, harvested, or restored peatlands, and by extension the nature of the carbon balance is uncertain. However, understanding the symbiotic processes governing water and gas exchange is essential to the development of appropriate management plans for peatland restoration. In this paper, we highlight and contrast the suite of processes governing the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon on natural, harvested, and restored peatlands. Evapotranspiration from harvested sites is important throughout the spring and summer, and is not greatly different from the adjacent natural bog. On cutover peatlands, strong capillary water movement compensates for the lack of vascular plants, which on the natural bog become increasingly important as the capillary water movement within drying Sphagnum decreases. Methane emissions from cutover bogs are an order of magnitude lower than in natural sites, however, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are approximately three times greater. Peatland restoration enhances CO2 sequestration, although restoration (at least in the short term) does not restore the net carbon sink function to that in natural bogs. A conceptual model highlighting these changes in the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon from a natural bog through drainage, harvesting, abandonment, and restoration is presented.

AB Empirical greenhouse gas (GHG) flux estimates from diverse peatlands are required in order to derive emission factors for managed peatlands. This study on a drained fen peatland quantified the annual GHG balance (Carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and C exported in crop yield) from spring barley (SB) and reed canary grass (RCG) using static opaque chambers for GHG flux measurements and biomass yield for indirectly estimating gross primary production (GPP). Estimates of ecosystem respiration (ER) and GPP were compared with more advanced but costly and labor-intensive dynamic chamber studies. Annual GHG balance for the two cropping systems was 4.0 +/- 0.7 and 8.1 +/- 0.2 Mg CO2-C-eq ha(-1) from SB and RCG, respectively (mean +/- standard error, n= 3). Annual CH4 emissions were negligible (<0.006 Mg CO2-C-eq ha(-1)), and N2O emissions contributed only 4-13 % of the full GHG balance (0.5 and 0.3 Mg CO2-C-eq ha(-1) for SB and RCG, respectively). The statistical significance of low CH4 and N2O fluxes was evaluated by a simulation procedure which showed that most of CH4 fluxes were within the range that could arise from random variation associated with actual zero-flux situations. ER measured by static chamber and dynamic chamber methods was similar, particularly when using nonlinear regression techniques for flux calculations. A comparison of GPP derived from aboveground biomass and from measuring net ecosystem exchange (NEE) showed that GPP estimation from biomass might be useful, or serve as validation, for more advanced flux measurement methods. In conclusion, combining static opaque chambers for measuring ER of CO2 and CH4 and N2O fluxes with biomass yield for GPP estimation worked well in the drained fen peatland cropped to SB and RCG and presented a valid alternative to estimating the full GHG balance by dynamic chambers.

AB Peat bogs have the ability to produce strong chelate ligands (humic and fulvic acids) which enhance the weathering rates of iron-silicate minerals and greatly increase the solubility of the essential trace metal iron in river water. Fluvial networks link peat bogs with the ocean, and thus terrestrial-derived fulvic-iron complexes fuel the ocean's biological productivity and biological carbon pump, but understanding this role is constrained by inconsistent observations regarding the behaviour of riverine iron in the estuarine mixing zone, where precipitation reactions remove iron from the water column. We applied a characterization of the colloidal iron carriers in peatland-draining rivers in North Scotland, using field-flow fractionation (FFF), in combination with end-member mixing experiments of river water sampled near the river mouth and coastal seawater using a Fe-59 radiotracer method. According to our results, the investigated river contributed "truly dissolved" Fe concentrations of about 3300 nmol L-1 to the ocean which is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the dissolved iron contribution of the "average world" river (similar to 40 nmol L-1). Thus we conclude that peatland-draining rivers are important sources of dissolved iron to the ocean margins. We propose highly electrostatic and sterical stabilized iron-organic matter complexes in the size range of <2 kDa to be responsible for iron transport across the estuarine mixing zone.

AB This study analysed the drainage influence on vegetation and peat deposit and assessed the self-restoration of ecological functions of Western Siberia bogs. As a case study, we selected four raised bogs - two are the east-northern spurs of the Great Vasyugan Mire and two are small, raised bogs on the terrace of the Bakchar River and the Ob River. The consequences of drainage and the ability to self-restore are influenced by the moisture conditions before drainage, bog size, distance between ditches and microtopography characteristics. The dominant species under wet conditions, such as Sphagnum magellanicum and Sphagnum balticum, changed with drainage to Sphagnum fuscum, and the peat accumulation rate increased. The sites with more dry conditions and dominated by Sphagnum fuscum were characterised by the intense degradation of Sphagnum, Bryidae and lichen growth and a low peat accumulation rate. Large raised bogs are relatively stable and capable of self-restoration. The drainage effect was more significant within some parts of the small bogs. Drainage consequences were less dramatic for large bogs, even in the marginal parts and near the ditches. A distance between ditches of 40 m and less is critical for self-restoration. Our study demonstrates that modern peat accumulation occurred in most parts of the plots; the mean peat accumulation rate over the last 35 years was 0.43 cm per year. Drainage influence in the south-eastern part of Western Siberia is less significant than in European bogs, not only because of the high stability of raised bogs but also because of the lower drainage intensity as well as the absence of forest planting, fertilisation and peat mining.

AB The different kind of soil nematode structures, based on the proportions of different orders, trophic groups and individuals belonging to groups with different life history strategies were studied in grasslands transformed by drainage of natural fens, situated at Biebrza Wetland in Poland. Natural fens were studied for comparison with drained meadows, which had a time span from 2 to 117 years after drainage. After conversion of fens into permanent managed meadows, the peat-forming process is replaced by a mucking process (mineralization and humification of peat), accompanied by physicochemical changes in the peat soil. When the nematofauna was classified into nine orders, the most abundant groups on drained meadows were tylenchids (36-84%) and rhabditids (12-39%), followed by araeolaimids, aphelenchids, dorylaimids, enoplids, mononchids, monhysterids and chromadorids. In terms of trophic categories, obligate plant feeders (19-64%) and bacterivores (13-55%) dominated, followed by facultative plant feeders, fungivores, omnivores and predators. Analysis of life history strategy expressed as percentage contribution of c-p classes to total nematodes indicated the dominance of the c-p 2 class, but its contribution decreased with time since drainage, as did the c-p I nematodes. The taxa in c-p 3 did not change, and the contribution of c-p 4 and c-p 5 increased with time. In natural fens, c-p 2 taxa also dominated, followed by c-p 1, c-P 3, c-P 4 and c-p 5 classes. As pulse-stabilized nutrient resources activated mainly by the peat mucking process still exist over succession, although the process rate declines over time, the achievement of a sub-climax state sensu Odum (1969) could be accepted for drained fen meadows. It is proposed that the point at which such a sub-climax state may start is not less than about 65 yearn after drainage, because it coincides with a point, when taxa c-p 4 and c-p 5 approach similar levels of dominance as in natural, undrained fens. The similarities between natural fens and drained sites after 117 years, measured by the Renkonen number, were 85.5, 72 and 77.1% corresponding to three kinds of structures. The maturity index Sigma MI significantly increased in the course of succession (P < 0.001). For considering the construction of Sigma MI over time, individuals of the separate c-p classes were expressed in trophic terms. The temporal changes in abundance of some genera are presented.

AB Trafficability in forest terrain is controlled by ground-bearing capacity, which is crucial from the timber harvesting point of view. In winter, soil frost affects the most the bearing capacity, especially on peatland soils which have in general low bearing capacity. Ground frost similarly affects the bearing capacity of forest truck roads. A 20 cm thick layer of frozen soil or 40 cm thick layer of snow on the ground may already be sufficient for heavy forest harvesters. In this work, we studied the impacts of climate change on soil frost conditions and, consequently, on ground-bearing capacity from the timber harvesting point of view. The number of days with good wintertime bearing capacity was modelled by using a soil temperature model with a snow accumulation model and wide set of downscaled climate model data until the end of the 21st century. The model was calibrated for different forest and soil types. The results show that by the mid-21st century, the conditions with good bearing capacity will decrease in wintertime in Finland, most likely by about 1 month. The decrease in soil frost and wintertime bearing capacity will be more pronounced during the latter half of the century, when drained peatlands may virtually lack soil frost in most of winters in southern and western Finland. The projected decrease in the bearing capacity, accompanied with increasing demand for wood harvesting from drained peatlands, induces a clear need for the development of sustainable and resource-efficient logging practices for drained peatlands. This is also needed to avoid unnecessary harvesting damages, like rut formation on soils and damage to tree roots and stems.

   land drainage
SO IRISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE drainage; hydraulic conductivity; peat
AB The selection of the hydraulic conductivity (K) of compressible peat for use in the design of drain spacing depends on: (i) whether the peat is drained or undrained; and (ii) the method of measurement of K. Drainage gives rise to dewatering and consolidation, while K measurement can cause swelling and consolidation. Swelling and consolidation affect the porosity of the peat, and can lead to significant differences in the values of K obtained. Selection of a suitable design value of K is problematical in view of the changes that can take place in K and in the peat depths as a result of drainage. In this study, three techniques were used to measure K in a blanket peat, viz. the auger hole, the piezometer and the drain-outflow methods. In some piezometric tests both recovery and falling-head procedures were used in the same hole. Values of K for undrained peat varied from 0.04 m / day to 1.34 m / day with a mean of 0.5 m / day and a coefficient of variation of 70%. However, the mean K value by the falling-head method in undrained peat was only 0.065 m / day. The falling-head (0.041 m / day), recovery (0.039 m / day) and auger-hole (0.12 m / day) methods in drained peat and the drain-outflow method (0.075 m / day) were only 9 to 27% of the mean by the auger hole and piezometer recovery methods in undrained peat. Because of consolidation and dewatering subsequent to drainage, a design value of K measured in undrained peat by the auger-hole or piezometer methods could result in an incorrect drain spacing. The variation of K in peat following on drainage can be assessed from a plot of drain outflows against water-table depth.

AB We present analyses of macroscopic and microscopic remains as a tool to characterise sedge fen peats. We use it to describe peat composition and stages of peat decomposition, to assess the success of rewetting of a formerly drained fen, and to understand the workings of these novel ecosystems. We studied two percolation fen sites, one drained and one drained and rewetted 20 years ago. Years of deep drainage have resulted in a layer of strongly decomposed peat which lacks recognizable macro-remains. We could associate micro-remains with macro-remains, and thus still characterise the peat and the plants that once formed it. We show that the strongly decomposed peat is of the same origin as the slightly decomposed peat below, and that is was ploughed. We present descriptions of eight types of the main constituent of sedge peat: plant roots, including Carex rostrata type, C. lasiocarpa/rostrata type, C. limosa type, C. acutiformis type, C. echinata type, Phragmites australis type, Cladium type, Equisetum type. We describe three new non-pollen palynomorph types (microscopic remains) and five new subtypes. The rewetted fen provides insights into plant succession after rewetting and the formation of peat that predominantly consists of roots. Results indicate that leaf sheaths may be a consistent component of the peat.

AB Methane (CH4) oxidation in soils is the only known biological sink of CH4. The sink strength of agricultural soils is known to be affected by soil properties and agricultural practices. We studied fluxes of CH4 in southern and northern Finland in arable soils with different texture and crops. The annual fluxes ranged from uptake of -1.2 kg CH4 ha(-1) to emission of 40 kg CH4 ha(-1). The CH4 oxidation decreased in the order loamy sand > well drained peat > clay > poorly drained peat. The more there were macropores or the less there were micropores in the soil, the higher was the mean annual CH4 oxidation rate. Calculated on the basis of the soil type specific CH4 flux rates from our study and the soil type distribution of Finnish agricultural soils, the total agricultural area in Finland would form an annual CH4 sink of -19 Gg CO2 equiv., which is 0.3% of the total reported greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture in 2004.

DE young broadleaved stands of natural origin; forest stand structure
AB The structure of 2 to 9-year-old natural origin broadleaved stands is analyzed, using the method of component analysis. The stands under study represent natural regrowth of trees in fertile cutovers of dry mineral, wet mineral, wet peatland, drained mineral, and drained peatland forest growing conditions. For analyzing the internal structure of young stands the following traits are used: a) the forest stand before felling and the forest adjoining the cutover - 22 traits; b) the structure of ground cover vegetation in cutover - 31 traits; c) the structure of young stand and soil characteristics - 45 traits. The results of component analysis show that the 160 young stands of the age from 2 to 9 years ought to be treated as a single population that could be denoted by a common term - young stands in fertile forest types.
   The initial density of natural origin broadleaved stands is notably high: in 89 % of the stands surveyed the number of stems exceeded 10,000 trees/ha while in individual cases it exceeded 120,000 trees/ha. The number tree stems shooting up naturally does not depend on the cutover width. As it follows from the analysis of stand structure (species composition and height), in a cutover the young stand may form a variety of biogroups. Because of significant differences in biogroup structure a unified thinning regime is not suitable for the whole site. In such cases the tending of young broadleaved stands ought to follow the biogroups of particular tree species.

AB Drainage and rewetting of peatlands changes their carbon (C) dynamics. We measured C stocks in the soil and biomass of drained and rewetted peatland forests in the region of the National Park Hunsruck-Hochwald, Germany. A detailed soil map was produced, showing the important soil properties for soil C stocks. Based on the horizon-substrate combination as well as LiDAR data, the spatial distribution of soil and forest C stocks was analysed. Our results show that our peatland sites have shallow soils with a heterogeneous spatial distribution. Mean (+/- SE) soil C stocks in the monitoring sites are 121(+/- 8) t ha(-1) whereas the forest stores on average 71(+/- 0.2) t ha(-1) of C in the biomass. Tree removal in the drained peatlands reduced the total C stocks by 4,430 t. The quality and longevity of the wood products that arise from tree removal will determine whether or not the harvested portion of the C captured by the trees is sequestered over long timescales. Additionally, the success of rewetting activities and the potential soil carbon sequestration or (non-) soil carbon loss will determine whether these ecosystems are carbon sinks or sources. An extrapolation of our data resulted in estimated C stocks of 171,530 t and 544,282 t for peatland soils and for the spruce forest, respectively, for the whole area of the National Park (about 10,000 ha).

AB Drained peatlands, especially nitrogen (N) -rich ones, are sources of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere. As this emission is largely caused by N mineralization in oxic peat soil, rewetting the peat soil is likely to decrease the N2O emissions to similar levels with natural, undrained peatlands. Emissions from these water-saturated peat soils have often been assumed negligible, for example in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories. However, the number of published data of annual N2O emissions from undrained peatlands is small and even smaller for rewetted peatlands. Thus, we still have limited understanding of the effects of land-use change such as drainage and rewetting. We analyzed N2O flux data, mostly previously unpublished, from 28 undrained, 65 forestry-drained, and 24 rewetted boreal peatland study sites in Finland and calculated annual N2O emissions for each site, including emissions from ditches at 51 sites. We classified the sites into nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor ones, similar to the IPCC guidelines. Annual N2O emissions from the undrained peatlands were consistently small, but not negligible, averaging 0.11 and 0.10 g m-2a 1 in the nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor sites, respectively. Emissions from the drained peatlands were significantly higher than from the undrained peatlands in the nutrient-rich (mean 0.23 g m(-2) a(-1)) but not in the nutrient-poor (mean 0.08 g m(-2) a(-1)) sites. Emissions from the rewetted peatlands (means 0.05 and 0.08 g m(-2) a(-1) for nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor sites, respectively) were similar or lower than from the undrained ones. Emissions from ditches were similar to those from strips and correlated positively with strip emissions at the drained sites. Nutrient-rich soil (low CN ratio) and a low water table increased emissions significantly at the drained sites, whereas the continuously higher water tables kept emissions low at all undrained and rewetted sites. In conclusion, rewetting is an effective means to decrease the N2O emissions of nutrient-rich drained peatlands back to natural levels, although this natural level is not zero, as has been suggested earlier.

AB 1. Habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation are the main threats to biodiversity. Human activities also create new habitat types that might fulfil ecological requirements for a variety of species.
   2. This study investigates whether the vegetation clearing (=shrub and tree cutting) on drained mire patches on power line rights-of-ways (ROWs) keep plant communities in an early successional stage and thus provide habitats for mire specialist and non-mire butterflies. It was further studied what would be the optimal clearing interval in terms of butterfly species richness and abundance.
   3. The results show that tree height, especially the height of birch, increases linearly over the 7-year period following vegetation clearing. The average birch height had a significant negative relationship with the species richness of mire and non-mire butterflies.
   4. The clearing interval had a significant curvilinear relationship with the abundance of both mire and non-mire butterflies, such that the highest abundances were documented two to four growing seasons after the clearing, which would hence be the ecologically optimal vegetation clearing cycle.
   5. In general, vegetation management on power line ROWs enhance favourable conditions for butterflies and may maintain habitats for mire-dependent butterflies, even on drained mires.

AB Spatiotemporal information on historical peatland drainage is needed to relate past land use to observed changes in catchment hydrology. Comprehensive knowledge of historical development of peatland management is largely unknown at the catchment scale. Aerial photos and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data enlarge the possibilities for identifying past peatland drainage patterns. Here, our objectives are (1) to develop techniques for semiautomatically mapping the location of ditch networks in peat-dominated catchments using aerial photos and LIDAR data, and (2) to generate time series of drainage networks. Our approaches provide open-access techniques to systematically map ditches in peat-dominated catchments through time. We focused on the algorithm in such a way that we can identify the ditch networks from raw aerial images and LIDAR data based on the modification of multiple filters and number of threshold values. Such data are needed to relate spatiotemporal drainage patterns to observed changes in many northern rivers. We demonstrate our approach using data from the Simojoki River catchment (3,160 km2) in northern Finland. The catchment is dominated by forests and peatlands that were almost all drained after 1960. For two representative locations in cultivated peatland (downstream) and peatland forest (upstream) areas of the catchment; we found total ditch length density (km/km2), estimated from aerial images and LIDAR data based on our proposed algorithm, to have varied from 2% to 50% compared with the monitored ditch length available from the National Land survey of Finland (NLSF) in 2018. A different pattern of source variation in ditch network density was observed for whole-catchment estimates and for the available drained-peatland database from Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE). Despite such differences, no significant differences were found using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test with a 0.05 significance level based on the samples of pixel-identified ditches between (1) aerial images and NLSF vector files and (2) LIDAR data and NLSF vector files.

ID MODEL
AB Models for predicting tree height were constructed for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce( Picea abies) and pubescent birch (Betula pubescens). The data consisted of two separate sets of permanent sample plots forming a representative sample of drained peatland stands in the whole country. A logarithmic height-diameter curve with one nonlinear parameter specific to each tree species was applied. It was assumed that the intercept and slope of the curve would vary randomly from stand to stand. Stand characteristics were used to predict the mean intercept and slope. A nonhomogeneous variance of the residual error was modelled as a function of tree diameter. A mixed linear model technique was applied to fit the models. The diameter of the tree of the median basal area, stand basal area, geographical location of the stand, and site quality were used as fixed independent variables in explaining the variation in the intercept. The diameter of the tree of the median basal area and the stand basal area were used in explaining the variation in the slope. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Goal-To establish regularity of transformation of drained peat bog soils, also changes in the water duty to floodplains in the process of agricultural use. Determine the ways of their rational use in the conditions of the Left-Bank Forest-Steppe.
   Research methods. General scientific and special, empirical and theoretical, historical - for a retrospective synthesis of scientific achievements of domestic and foreign scientists on the study of the formation of indicators of fertility and productivity of drained soils; analytical - for analysis of conditions and processes of changing fertility indicators; laboratory - for determination of agrochemical and water-physical properties of soil; field - to establish the botanical composition of the grass stand, accumulation of the amount of root and crop residues in the soil, to establish the intensity of mineralization of organic matter and crop productivity; mathematical statistics - to assess the reliability of the research results.
   Many years of experience summarized and scientific estimates of the transformation of drained peat bog soils with long-term agricultural use are presented. It has been established that over 80 years of use of these soils in agricultural production, peat deposits wear amounted to 100 cm (in the early years, an annual decrease in peat depth was 1, 63, subsequent - 1, 45, and the last - 0, 88 cm). Decrease the depth of the peat bed also occurs due to their compaction.
   Qualitative and quantitative changes in peat soils under the influence of drainage and long-term agricultural use we researched. We have established the patterns and directions of soil processes depending on the influence of the duration of development of peat soils. We also identified scientific and methodological approaches to assessing the conditions and factors affecting the formation of fertility and productivity of drained soils. We have analyzed existing approaches to rationalizing nature management, taking into account the characteristics of the economic development of drained lands.
   Regularities and directions of transformation of drained peat bog soils under the influence of long-term agricultural use are justified. We have identified trends in the indicators of fertility and productivity of drained peat bog soils. We have implemented a systematic approach to the spatiotemporal study of the soil potential of drained soils in order to rationalize nature management in the risky farming zone. We also found that the high-productivity use of organogenic soils provides for the functioning of agrophytocenoses from perennial crops with the aim of creating conservation agrolandscapes and improving the ecological balance in the floodplains of small rivers.

Among the forestry activities, draining of wetlands had the most pronounced impacts on sediment, nutrient, and metal loading in the past. At present, renovation of old ditches and fertilization of peatlands constitute the major risk of forestry-induced diffuse pollution. Contemporary forestry aims at decreasing this risk with various riparian buffer strip designs. Among such designs, creation of overland flow areas by plugging the outlet ditches is increasingly used. Our objectives were to evaluate the potential of constructed overland flow areas to function as riparian buffers and estimate the quality and quantity of diffuse pollution from old versus recent forest drainages. We studied retention and release of pollutants from 20 constructed, 2- to 10-m-wide overland flow areas receiving drainage water from forested peatlands. Drainage waters were sampled above and below the plugged ditches three times per year from 1998 to 1999. Chemical oxygen demand and nutrient and metal loads and concentrations varied strongly between seasons, years, and drainage areas. Areas subjected to recent ditch renovations and fertilizations had clearly elevated seasonal loads and concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), PO4, Fe, and A in comparison to old treatment areas. Especially TP loads were high above the national average values measured for forestry-induced diffuse pollution. In general, water quality above and below the buffer strips did not differ significantly. Our results indicate that plugged outlet ditches and associated narrow overland flow areas do not function as proper buffers in peatland areas. We suggest that wider buffers with extensive overland flow areas are needed in order to control diffuse pollution from forested and drained peatlands.

AB The SOIL and MACRO models with different versions of SOILN initially developed for small field-scales were used to simulate the water flow and nitrate N concentrations in two watersheds in Estonia that contain large areas of peat soils. Monitoring data show that nitrogen concentrations tend to increase in some rivers even where the human activity is very low. This may be connected to soil self-degradation processes taking place in drained peat soils where it is difficult to use most of the hydrological models. Results show that SOIL, MACRO and SOILN may be successfully applied at the watershed scale to model the water quantity and quality on watersheds with high content of peat soils. The analysis revealed that the nitrate nitrogen level trends depend considerably on the meteorological conditions.

AB Peatlands are important ecosystems for carbon (C) storage, provision of water resources and biodiversity. UK blanket peats represent 10-15% of those found worldwide. While many peatlands continue to be managed through artificial drainage and vegetation burning, it has long been recognized that local habitats and ecological diversity are strongly influenced by these practices. This paper reviews the hydrological, physicochemical and ecological effects of three widespread U K peatland management practices, namely artificial drainage, drain-blocking and rotational heather burning. Drainage and burning of peat often lead to altered runoff regimes, oxidation of organic matter, changes to C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling, and increased metal and suspended sediment concentrations in streams relative to intact peatlands. Although artificial drainage is now rarely implemented on UK upland peats, a great number of historical drains remain, thus drain-blocking is increasingly being applied to restore many peatlands. In contrast, recent increases in the intensity and extent of rotational heather burning may result in further changes to peatland ecosystems. Relatively little is known about the environmental effects of rotational heather burning compared with drainage and drain-blocking management, and for all three of these management techniques there is scarce information on river ecosystem response. We hypothesize some likely effects of basin-scale drainage, drain-blocking and heather burning on stream ecosystems and illustrate these with a schematic model. Such a holistic consideration of peatland river basins is particularly timely with respect to the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive.

AB The phosphorus adsorption capacity of 20 peat soils and those soil properties likely to influence it (Al, Fe, Ca, Mg, pH, ash content) were studied. Phosphorus adsorption was correlated only weakly to the site type classification of peatlands. However, the P adsorption was strongly correlated with the concentration of Fe in the peat. Thus, soil chemical analysis should be used to support site type classification in order to assess the effectiveness of peatlands to adsorb P. When expressed on a volume basis, the P adsorption capacity varied from 7 kg ha(-1) to 673 kg ha(-1) in the 0-30 cm layer. Compared with the amounts of P used in practical peatland forest fertilization in Finland (40-45 kg ha(-1)), the P adsorption capacity of several peat soils studied was substantially lower. It was thus concluded that slowly soluble P fertilizers or applications <40-45 kg ha(-1) should be used where the P adsorption capacity is low.

AB The estimates ambiguity of the consequences of both mires drainage and restoration in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and the rate of modern peat accumulation, potential fire hazard, and biodiversity dynamics makes it necessary to conduct research on the current state and trends of self-recovery of biosphere functions of drained raised bogs in the southern taiga subzone of West Siberia. The goal of this work is to assess the intensity of peat accumulation and the degree of transformation of peat deposits within the drained raised bogs the South-Eastern part of West Siberia based on the analysis of the physical properties and botanical composition of peat.
   The objects under study are 8 key sites in drained and similar natural pine-shrub-sphagnum raised bog. The species composition is characterized by the dominance of Pinus sylvestris, Ledum palustre, Chamaedaphne calculata and sphagnum mosses. The area under study were drained in 1980 by a network of open channels for the purpose of forest melioration and peat extraction. The lack of planting and repair of the drainage network has led to the development of self-recovery processes in drained mires.
   Field studies of the sites included the access of peat deposit depths, selecting stratigraphic layer by type and degree of decomposition of peat by visual method; sampling peat in steps of 5 cm to a depth of 90 cm using a Russian peat corer. Laboratory analysis of peat included determination of the following characteristics: Botanical composition, degree of decomposition, ash content, water content, bulk density. We take analyzed a total of 162 peat samples. The significance of differences in the physical properties of peat in drained and natural bogs was assessed using the Mann-Whitney test (U-test). Classification of sites by criteria of physical properties of peat was performed by cluster analysis.
   The consequences of drainage are manifested in a change in the species composition of mosses and an increase in the proportion of wood residues in the peat deposit upper layer. On two sites, the change of balticum and magellanicum peat to fuscum peat at a depth of 25 cm was noted. The other site is characterized by the appearance of upper layer of green mosses in the peat composition with a maximum share of their presence at a depth of 15-20 cm. Two sites are characterized by the formation of wood peat in the upper layer, with almost complete absence of sphagnum moss residues here, which can be an indicator of the almost complete absence of the process of peat deposits modern accumulation.
   As a result of the study, it is shown that the bulk density of peat characterizes the rate of accumulation of peat and is directly related to the ash content and the degree of decomposition. The increase in density in the peat layer at depths up to 25 cm corresponds to the period of peat accumulation during the maximum effect of drainage. The change in ash content with depth and a maximum value in the layer of 15-35 cm is an indicator of the transformation of the peat layer located on the surface during the first years after drainage, and is generally consistent with the laws of bulk density changes in depth.
   According to the results of the study, it was found that the peat layer formed after drainage reclamation changes from 0 to 25-30 cm in different key sites. In 6 of the 8 studied sites, the process of modern peat accumulation is observed; in two sites, the rate of peat accumulation is minimal or completely absent.

AB Availability of macrophyte habitat is recognized as an important driver of aquatic insect communities in peatland drainage ditches; however, eutrophication can lead to the decline of submerged vegetation. While emergent vegetation is able to persist in eutrophicated ditches, vegetation removal, carried out during ditch maintenance, can reduce the availability of this habitat. In this study, we applied the landscape filtering approach to determine whether the absence of emergent vegetation is a habitat filter which structures aquatic insect communities in peatland drainage ditches under different trophic conditions. To this end, a field study was carried out in one mesotrophic (Naardermeer) and one eutrophic (Wormer and Jisperveld) peatland in the province of North Holland, The Netherlands. We assigned life history strategies to insect species and applied linear mixed models and redundancy analyses to taxonomic and functional aquatic insect community data. Our results indicate that while differences between peatlands primarily determine the species pool within each wetland, emergent vegetation acted as a secondary filter by structuring functional community composition within ditches. The eutrophic peatland was dominated by insects adapted to abiotic extremes, while species with good dispersal abilities were strongly related to emergent vegetation cover. This study demonstrates the applicability of life history strategies to provide insight into the filtering of species due to availability of emergent macrophyte habitat. To ensure greater diversity of insect communities in ditch habitats, it is recommended that some vegetation be spared during maintenance to leave patches from which insect recolonization can occur.

AB The effect of clear-cutting on the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), organic nitrogen (DON), NH4+, NO3-, and P in outflow water from three productive, Norway spruce dominated drained peatlands (R-CC, VCC-1, VCC-2) were studied. Changes in runoff and transport loads (concentration x runoff) at two of the catchments during the frost-free period are also presented. Approximately 40% of the area was cut at RCC and VCC-2, and 72% at VCC-1. The volume removed was 250 m(3) ha(-1) at R-CC, 259 m(3) ha(-1) at VCC-1, and for VCC-2, 317 m(3) ha(-1). The mean annual increase in outflow concentrations of DOC during the first four years after clear-cutting was 9.0 mg l(-1) at RCC, 22.8 mg l(-1) at VCC-1 and 8.4 mg l(-1) at VCC-2. Corresponding increases in the forms of nitrogen were: 0.23, 0.51 and 0.16 mg DON l(-1); 0.06, 0.31 and 0.04 mg NH4+-N l(-1); and 0.05, 0.12 and 0.22 mg NO3--Nl(-1). Clear-cutting did not significantly (p>0.05) increase P concentrations. The increase in non-frost season runoff over the first three years after clear-cutting was 107 mm at R-CC and 207 mm at VCC-1. The export loads of DOC during the nonfrost season increased by 80 kg ha(-1) at RCC and by 184 kg ha(-1) at VCC-1 over the first three years. Corresponding increases for the other studied solutes were: 1.78 and 3.98 kg DON ha(-1); 0.39 and 1.49 kg NH4+-N ha(-1); 0.45 and 0.48 kg NO3--N ha(-1), and 0.09 and 0.06 kg P ha(-1). The study demonstrated that clear-cutting may significantly increase the export of DOC and different forms of nitrogen from drained productive peatlands while only small increases in phosphorus export may occur.

AB Hot and cold water-extractable organic carbon (HWC and CWC, respectively) fractions, as good indicators of organic matter quality, as well as water repellency (WDPT test) and state of secondary humification were analyzed in topsoil samples of peatland drained for agricultural purposes 160 years ago. The examined sites (drained and used as grassland) at the peatland had been affected by the moorsh-forming process. During this process, intense mineralization and secondary humification of organic matter took place. The state of transformation of organic soils varied from weak to complete degradation. The HWC contents ranged between 2.623 and 3.572 g kg(-1) in field-moist samples and 3.999 and 6.074 g kg(-1) in air-dried soil samples. The CWC contents were generally lower than HWC and ranged between 0.411 and 0.535 g kg(-1) in field-moist samples and 0.696 and 0.939 g kg(-1) in air-dried soil samples. The examined soils were extremely water repellent when dried. The measures of transformation of peat after drainage and WDPT were not significantly correlated, but a tendency for higher values of water repellency at the site regarded as degraded was noted. Deep drainage caused an increase of HWC fraction, which in light of the moorsh-forming process should be regarded as negative. The topsoil of the peatland became dry and resistant to rewetting. However, when the ground water level is maintained at not deeper than 0.50 m, the changes in peat matter do not lead to degradation. HWC is a good measure to show differences occurring within the ecosystem. Given its correlation with state of transformation (W1 index) and water repellency (WDPT test), HWC is a good measurement of peat quality. HWC and WDPT measurements may be helpful in determining degradation of peat soil after drainage.

AB The blocking of drainage ditches in peat has been proposed as a possible mitigation strategy for the widely observed increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations from northern peatlands. This study tested the hypothesis that drain-blocking could lead to lower DOC concentrations by measuring the DOC export from a series of small peat-covered catchments over a period of 2 years. Six catchments were chosen: two were pristine that had never been drained; three where drains had been blocked (one in 1995, and two in 2003); and a control peat drain catchment where the drain was left unblocked throughout the study. In the case where drains were blocked as part of thus Study, the drains were observed for 2 months before blocking and 2 years after blocking. The results show that: (i) high concentrations of DOC can come from water ponded in the drain; (ii) the DOC export (flux of DOC per area of catchment) from the six study catchments shows a high degree of positive correlation with both catchment size and water yield; (iii) distinctly lower DOC export with water yield was observed for the catchments containing higher-order channels (> 27500 m(2)) as opposed to single drain catchments (> 7500 m(2)); (iv) drain-blocking resulted in a statistically significant decrease in DOC export (average was 39%) but the effect upon DOC concentration explained only 1% of the variance in the data. The results suggest that drain blocking works by decreasing the flow from the drain, not by changing the production of DOC in the peat. The change in export with catchment size implies a considerable removal of DOC from large catchments. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Rewetting of drained fens is necessary to stop further soil degradation and to reestablish important ecological functions. However, substantial changes of peat characteristics in the upper soil layers, due to drainage and land use, could counteract their recovery as nutrient-poor systems for an unknown period. We assessed the importance of altered peat properties, such as the degree of peat decomposition and the amount of redox-sensitive phosphorus (P) compounds, for P mobilization in different degraded fens. An experimental design involving 63 intact peat cores from fens with varying drainage and land-use histories was developed to quantify the mobilization of P, as well as that of iron (Fe), ammonium, carbon dioxide, and methane, all indicators of organic-matter decomposition and/or P-releasing processes. We found that net P release rates in peat cores with highly decomposed peat (range: 0.1-52.3 mg P.m(-2).d(-1)) were significantly correlated to the amount of P bound to redox-sensitive compounds and the molar Fe: P as well as Al:P ratios of peat. We conclude that the following general rules apply for P mobilization in rewetted fens: (1) elevated levels of P release rates and P concentrations in pore water up to three orders of magnitude larger than under natural reference conditions can only be expected for rewetted fens whose surface soil layers consist of highly decomposed peat; (2) peat characteristics, such as the amount of P bound to redox-sensitive Fe(III) compounds (positive correlation) and molar ratios of Fe: P or Al: P (negative correlations), explain the high range of P release rates; and (3) a critical P export to adjacent lakes or rivers can only be expected if molar Fe: P ratios of highly decomposed peat are less than 10.

AB High demand for horticultural peat has increased peatland drainage and peat extraction in Canada. The hydrology and carbon cycling of these cutover peatlands is greatly altered, necessitating active restoration efforts to permit the regeneration of Sphagnum mosses and the re-establishment of natural peatland function. The effect of peatland extraction and restoration on the export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was examined for three successive seasons (May to October, 1999 to 2001) at two different sites (cutover and restored) in eastern Quebec. A shift towards higher DOC concentrations was observed following peatland extraction (maximum: 182.6 mg L(-1)) and concentrations remained high post-restoration (maximum: 191.0 mg L(-1)). The cutover site exported more DOC than the restored site in all three study seasons. The highest exports occurred during the wettest year (1999), with cutover and restored site export of 10.3 and 4.8 g m(-2), respectively. In 2000, 8.5 g C m(-2) was released from the cutover site, while the restored site released less than half that amount (3.4 g C m(-2)). In 2001, the restored site released about the same amount of DOC as in the previous year (3.5 g C m(-2)), while the cutover site load dropped to 6.2 g C m(-2). Both sites were net exporters of DOC in all years. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This study compares the CO2 exchange of a natural bog forest, and of a bog drained for forestry in the pre-Alpine region of southern Germany. The sites are separated by only 10 km, they share the same soil formation history and are exposed to the same climate and weather conditions. In contrast, they differ in land use history: at the Schechenfilz site a natural bog-pine forest (Pinus mugo ssp. rotundata) grows on an undisturbed, about 5m thick peat layer; at Mooseurach a planted spruce forest (Picea abies) grows on drained and degraded peat (3.4 m). The net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) at both sites has been investigated for 2 years (July 2010-June 2012), using the eddy covariance technique. Our results indicate that the drained, forested bog at Mooseurach is a much stronger carbon dioxide sink (-130 +/- 31 and -300 +/- 66 g C m(-2) a(-1) in the first and second year, respectively) than the natural bog forest at Schechenfilz (-53 +/- 28 and -73 +/- 38 g C m(-2) a(-1)). The strong net CO2 uptake can be explained by the high gross primary productivity of the 44-year old spruces that overcompensates the two-times stronger ecosystem respiration at the drained site. The larger productivity of the spruces can be clearly attributed to the larger plant area index (PAI) of the spruce site. However, even though current flux measurements indicate strong CO2 uptake of the drained spruce forest, the site is a strong net CO2 source when the whole life-cycle since forest planting is considered. It is important to access this result in terms of the long-term biome balance. To do so, we used historical data to estimate the difference between carbon fixation by the spruces and the carbon loss from the peat due to drainage since forest planting. This rough estimate indicates a strong carbon release of +134 t C ha(-1) within the last 44 years. Thus, the spruces would need to grow for another 100 years at about the current rate, to compensate the potential peat loss of the former years. In contrast, the natural bog-pine ecosystem has likely been a small but stable carbon sink for decades, which our results suggest is very robust regarding short-term changes of environmental factors.

AB From the 8th/9th centuries onwards the former peat land area in the northwestern part of the Netherlands was drained and reclaimed. Drainage, peat digging and marine erosion of peat deposits created an extension of shallow marine habitats into which Zostera marina (Eel-grass) expanded. Modern publications do not note the use of Eel-grass as starting material for salt-making. Archaeological evidence, however, indicates salt-making activities by using Zostera in medieval times. We postulate that, after salt-containing peat had become difficult to obtain, Eel-grass was used for salt production.

AB Globally, large-scale land drainage has severely deteriorated the functioning and services of peatlands, making restoration plans of the utmost importance. Rewetting is essential for the restoration of drained peatlands, but the level of success including greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation largely depends on the soil microbiome interactions under the prevailing biogeochemical conditions. Here, we investigated the effects of inundation of drained iron (Fe) -rich peat topsoils on nutrient release, surface water quality, GHG production and consumption, and on the composition and activity of the microbial community. The effect of the addition of different potential electron acceptors on methane (CH4) production and consumption were studied in incubation experiments. In response to inundation, porewater concentrations of Fe, total inorganic carbon, ammonium, and phosphorus increased. CH4 emissions increased in the control (i.e. without any additions) and Fe(III) oxide amended incubations upon inundation. This could be explained by the increase in the relative abundance of methanogens even though Fe(III) was previously hypothesized to lower methanogenic activity. In contrast, nitrite, nitrate, and sulfate-rich incubations inhibited methanogenesis. The prolonged exposure to nitrogen oxides stimulated denitrification with nitrous oxide (N2O) as the main gaseous product, together with an increase in the relative abundance of denitrifying microorganisms. Our results demonstrate that insights into the changes in microbial communities in relation to soil geochemistry explain differences in responses observed in different peat soils observed upon inundation. The increase in emissions of the potent GHGs CH4 and N2O from Fe-rich peat topsoils are a major adverse effect in the early stage of inundation.

AB Hydrophysical properties of peat influence the partitioning of rainfall into infiltration versus runoff, determine water flow and solute transport patterns, and regulate the carbon and nitrogen cycles in peatlands. Compared with mineral soils, our understanding of hydraulic properties of peat soils is limited, especially of the temporal dynamics of peat properties. A data set of peat subsidence as well as the bulk density (BD) change rate following artificial drainage was assembled from the literature. The collected data cover a time period of up to 272 years of land drainage for forestry and agriculture in boreal and temperate climate zones. The results show that the subsidence rate and BD change rate, and hydrophysical properties of peat can be estimated based on land drainage duration and land use. The most severe shift in pore structure of peat occurs within the first 20 years of land drainage. Peatland drainage reduces macroporosity with pore diameter greater than 50 mu m, but increases the volume of pores <5 mu m. In the long term, peat thickness loss is responsible for more than 80% of water storage loss. In conclusion, the derived functions between subsidence rate, BD change rate, and drainage duration provide a new approach to estimate the hydrophysical properties of peat (pore structure, saturated hydraulic conductivity, specific yield, and soil water storage) on a centennial scale. The derived hydrophysical parameter values can be used for long-term hydrological modeling, especially if measured hydraulic parameters of peat are not available.

AB In drained, forested peatlands, ditch network maintenance (DNM) is often considered necessary for tree growth, but it also constitutes additional management costs. Commercial thinnings, in turn, in addition to their silvicultural benefits, are generally applied to enhance the financial performance of stand management but results from peatland stands are scarce. In this study, our aim was to find financially feasible management practices for Scots pine-dominated stands on drained peatland sites in Finland. Using mainly inventory data sets, we compiled altogether 29 typical model-stands for four climatic areas, four site types, and two stand conditions according to need for silvicultural care. We used MOTTI stand simulator to predict the development of the model-stands according to different management regimes consisting of various combinations of 0-2 DNM and 0-2 thinnings with different timings and thinning intensities. We then calculated and compared the financial feasibility of the regimes using net present value (NPV; discount rate 3%) analysis. The separate effect of DNM on the profitability was marginal, but the positive effect of thinnings was clear. The harvesting removals varied within a wide range, depending on the timing and intensity of thinnings, but on average, the NPV doubled due to the thinnings. In the stands of initially good silvicultural condition, regimes including only one thinning and a DNM operation generally displayed a good financial result. In the stands of initially poor silvicultural condition due to neglected early care, regimes with two thinnings produced the best NPV regardless of the often low-yielding first thinning.

AB Over the past several decades there has been a massive increase in coastal eutrophication, which is often caused by increased runoff input of nitrogen from landscape alterations. Peatlands, covering 3% of land area, have stored about 12-21% of global soil organic nitrogen (12-20 Pg N) around rivers, lakes and coasts over millennia and are now often drained and farmed. Their huge nitrogen pools may be released by intensified climate driven hydrologic events-prolonged droughts followed by heavy storms-and later transported to marine ecosystems. In this study, we collected peat monoliths from drained, natural, and restored coastal peatlands in the Southeastern U.S., and conducted a microcosm experiment simulating coupled prolonged-drought and storm events to ( 1) test whether storms could trigger a pulse of nitrogen export from drought-stressed peatlands and ( 2) assess how differentially hydrologic managements through shifting plant communities affect nitrogen export by combining an experiment of nitrogen release from litter.
   During the drought phase, we observed a significant temporal variation in net nitrogen mineralization rate (NMR). NMR spiked in the third month and then decreased rapidly. This pattern indicates that drought duration significantly affects nitrogen mineralization in peat. NMR in the drained site reached up to 490 +/- 110 kg ha(-1)-year(-1), about 5 times higher than in the restored site. After the 14-month drought phase, we simulated a heavy storm by bringing peat monoliths to saturation. In the discharge waters, concentrations of total dissolved nitrogen in the monoliths from the drained site (72.7 +/- 16.3 mg L-1) was about ten times as high as from the restored site. Our results indicate that previously drained peatlands under prolonged drought are a potent source of nitrogen export. Moreover, drought-induced plant community shifts to herbaceous plants substantially raise nitrogen release with lasting effects by altering litter quality in peatlands. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB (1) Huge reductions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) effluxes can be attained by rewetting drained peatlands, but this will increase methane (CH4) effluxes.
   (2) The scientific data base for methane effluxes from peatlands is much larger than that for CO2 or N2O. Once anoxic conditions are provided, the availability of fresh plant material is the major factor in methane production. Old (recalcitrant) peat plays only a subordinate role in gas efflux.
   (3) The annual mean water level is a surprisingly good indicator for methane effluxes, but at high water levels the cover of aerenchymous shunts (gas conductive plant tissue) becomes a better proxy. Ideally, both water level and cover of aerenchymous shunts should be assessed to arrive at robust estimates of methane effluxes.
   (4) The available data provide sufficient guidance for arriving at moderately accurate (Tier 1) estimates consistent with IPCC methodologies. For more accurate estimation (higher tier approaches), vegetation provides a promising basis for development of more detailed efflux factors. Vegetation is a good proxy for mean water levels and can provide - with extra attention to aerenchymous shunts - a robust proxy for accurate and spatially explicit estimates of methane effluxes over large areas.

AB Rewetting of agriculturally used peatlands has been proposed as a measure to stop soil subsidence, conserve peat and rehabilitate ecosystem functioning. Unintended consequences might involve nutrient release and changes in the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance towards CH4-dominated emission. To investigate the risks and benefits of rewetting, we subjected soil columns from drained peat- and clay-covered peatlands to different water level treatments: permanently low, permanently inundated and fluctuating (first inundated, then drained). Surface water and soil pore water chemistry, soil-extractable nutrients and greenhouse gas fluxes were measured throughout the experiment. Permanent inundation released large amounts of nutrients into pore water, especially phosphorus (up to 11.7 mg P-PO4 l(-1)) and ammonium (4.8 mg N-NH4 l(-1)). Phosphorus release was larger in peat than in clay soil, presumably due to the larger pool of iron-bound phosphorus in peat. Furthermore, substantial amounts of phosphorus and potassium were exported from the soil matrix to the surface water, risking the pollution of local species-rich (semi-)aquatic ecosystems. Rewetting of both clay and peat soil reduced CO2 emissions. CH4 emissions increased, but, in contrast to the expectations, the fluxes were relatively low. Calculations showed that rewetting reduced net cumulative GHG emissions expressed as CO2 equivalents.

AB Peatland drainage has caused enormous environmental problems at global scale; in particular, ongoing greenhouse gas emissions and soil degradation. In Belarus, which is rich in peatlands and a hotspot of emissions from drained peatlands, several thousand hectares have already been re-wetted but are not used productively. Moreover, vast areas of wet (undrained) peatland that are designated for nature conservation are in need of mowing and biomass removal. Plants such as common reed (Phragmites australis), reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) and sedges (Carex spp.) which frequently dominate these areas could be harvested and used as fuel, potentially as a substitute for peat. In this study we analysed the yield and combustibility of late harvests in March/April 2009 and 2010. The yields of 3.7-11.7 t DM ha(-1) were within the range reported from other studies on wetland plants. Concentrations of Cl, S, N, P, C, Ca, K, Mg and Na, as well as water and ash contents, indicated similar or better combustibility when compared to other strawlike (graminaceous) plants such as Miscanthus. The full replacement of peat fuel by biomass from wet peatlands in Belarus would require an area of 680,000 ha, i.e. 'only' half of the peatland that has been drained for agriculture.

AB Peatland rewetting is a widely used restoration technique, yet the recovery of anaerobic processes is poorly characterized. Microbes involved in anaerobic processes, especially methanogens, could reflect the stabilization of anaerobic conditions, vegetation succession and overall restoration success.
   We investigated the effect of long-term drainage and hydrological rewetting on methanogenic abundance, community composition and CH4 production potential in bogs and spruce swamp forests. Additionally, the substrate limitation of methanogens was tested with a focus on original peatland plant species and their spreading after rewetting by addition of natural substrates.
   Drainage strongly reduced the abundance and diversity of the methanogenic community. After rewetting, methanogenic abundance and community composition reached almost a pristine-like state, however their CH4 production remained as low as in the drained sites. Substrate addition confirmed the substrate limitation of methanogens due to strongly decomposed peat and the slow spreading of original peatland vegetation. The addition of natural substrates supported methanogenesis close to a pristine-like level. The limited CH4 production reflected not fully recovered anaerobic microbial community composition and vegetation structure 7-16 years after rewetting, although anaerobic conditions seemed to stabilize. Thus, the reestablishment of peatland vegetation structure is crucial for the recovery of methanogenic activity and microbial processes in rewetted peatlands. Moreover, methanogenic community composition, abundance and activity could be used as indicators of restoration success.
   Originality significant statement: Peatland drainage is increasingly recognized as a major problem affecting the status of valuable natural habitats, water quality and global carbon balance. Rewetting projects are set up to combat and mitigate the losses; yet not enough is known about the recovery of anaerobic processes, especially methanogenesis, which are assumed to reflect stabilization of anaerobic conditions and overall restoration success. Forestry-drained spruce swamp forests and bogs, common in northern Europe, are currently rewetted for both nature conservation purposes and for their anticipated function as hydrological buffers, but information on the recovery of anaerobic microbial communities and especially methanogens are only partly known.
   Our study concerns the effect of long-term drainage and hydrological rewetting on methanogenic abundance, community composition and activity (CH4 production potential) in undrained, drained and rewetted bogs and spruce swamp forests in the Bohemian Forest, Central Europe. We searched for a reason of limited methanogenic activity in rewetted sites by addition of natural substrates simulating the spreading of original peatland plants (Sphagnum, sedges). This paper contributes to scientific understanding on how long it takes for rewetted peatlands to recover anaerobic microbial communities, anaerobic processes and what are the crucial factors in this process. These results provides a basis for further studies on the trophic relations between anaerobic microbes and recovery of the drained peatlands after rewetting. This study can also extend a set of indicators which should be use for restoration progress evaluation.

AB Sites (n = 119) on drained mires located in the southern aapa mire zone in Finland were analysed by multivariate techniques. The compositional trends of the understorey vegetation were analysed by means of hybrid multidimensional scaling (HMDS). In addition to field classification, two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) and flexible unweighted paired group arithmetic average (FUPGMA) classifications were used.
   The 1st HMDS dimension primarily reflected variation along a gradient from spruce mire influence to hummock-level bog influence. Variation in nutrient status was also connected to this gradient. Factors underlying the 2nd dimension were variation in nutrient status and drainage succession (moisture). Some sample plots representing herb-rich or Molinia-rich types were separated along the 3rd dimension. The variation in understorey vegetation (i.e. the ordination space) showed high maximum correlation with stand volume r = 0.81, mean annual stand volume increment r = 0.76, and post-drainage dominant height r = 0.75. The covariation between the vegetation and peat bulk density in both the 0-10 and 10-20 cm peat layers was also strong: r = 0.55 and r = 0.80. The correlations for H-vpost were 0.64 and 0.81, respectively. Of the total macronutrient concentrations, phosphorus (r = 0.73, r = 0.75) and nitrogen (r = 0.59, r = 0.64) were the most strongly correlated with species composition. The environmental sample variables were also presented by the vegetation units of numerical classification. Most of the recorded variables, including nutrient amounts (kg ha(-1)), were examined in site quality (fertility) classes by succession phases as well. Border variants or transitional forms of the site types were common. Additional vegetation criteria (e.g. surface-water influence) more closely defined the ecology of the site. In addition to the site quality classes, a considerable amount of information about the tree stands, vegetation diversity and peat properties was associated with the separation of the succession phases, i.e. in this study transforming (phase II) vs. transformed (final phase III) sites. In conclusion, the actual vegetation appeared to well reflect various aspects of the ecological conditions, even in labile communities of commercial forests on drained peatlands.

AB We studied the effects of restoration on water-table depth (WTD), element concentrations of peat and vegetation composition of peatlands drained for forestry in southern Finland. The restoration aimed to return the trajectory of vegetation succession toward that of undisturbed systems through the blockage of ditches and the removal of trees. Permanent plots established on a bog and a fen were sampled 1 year before, and 1, 2, 3, and 10 years after the restoration. The restoration resulted in a long-term rise of the water-table in both peatlands. Ten years after restoration, the mineral element concentrations (Ca, K, Mg, Mn, and P) of peat corresponded to those reported from comparable pristine peatlands. In particular, the increase of K and Mn concentrations at both sites suggests the recovery of ecosystem functionality in terms of nutrient cycling between peat and plants. The restoration resulted in the succession of plant communities toward the targeted peatland vegetation of wetter condition at both sites. This was evident from the decreased abundance of species benefiting from drainage and the corresponding increase of peatland species. However, many species typical of pristine peatlands were missing 10 years after restoration. We conclude that the restoration led to a reversal of the effects of drainage in vegetation and studied habitat conditions. However, due to the slow recovery of peatland ecosystems and the possibility that certain failures in the restoration measures may become apparent only after extended time periods, long-term monitoring is needed to determine whether the goals of restoration will be met.

AB A process-based model was developed and validated to predict the regional dynamics of the water table (WT) in peatlands under climatic forcing. The model detailed the water-energy feedbacks in the common SVAT (soil-vegetation-atmosphere transportation) model and specified the differences in processes in pristine fens, pristine bogs and drained peatlands. The spatiotemporal changes in the WT of the peatlands throughout Finland were computed based on 10 km x 10 km grids for the period 2000-2099. The calculations used country-scale data on vegetation, catchment topography and profiles of peat bulk density and water content in the three mire types. Furthermore, the ACCLIM climate scenarios representing the current climate and the changing climate were used to identify the climatic impacts on the WT throughout Finland.
   Sensitivity analysis showed that the WT drawdown in pristine fens was most sensitive to increases in temperature and/or decreases in precipitation, whereas the WT drawdown in drained peatlands was the most resistant to such changes. For all three mire types, a 10% increase in precipitation based on the current climate tended to offset the effect of a 2 degrees C warming on WT drawdown and a 20% increase in precipitation tended to offset the WT drawdown caused by a 6 degrees C warming. Based on the ACCLIM climate scenario, the model showed moderate changes in the annual values of the WT, which ranged from +0.2 +/- 1.5 to -4.3 +/- 0.93 cm. The changes were most noticeable during the period 2060-2099. The drawdown was more pronounced in late spring than in summer and autumn. Additionally, the WT drawdown was most significant in the western parts of the northern aapa-mire region, where the peatlands were mostly pristine, and the increase of precipitation was more limited than in other parts of the country. These results show that the pronounced spatiality and temporality in the WT changes should be considered in studies addressing how climate change will affect mire ecosystems in terms of C balance and GHG emissions.

Ant nests covered 0.09, 0.07, and 0.02% of the areas of the respective habitats. Changes within ant nests included reduction of soil bulk density by 29%-36% and of soil moisture by 2%-17%, and also an increase in microfloral abundance and enzymatic activity. Organic matter in ant nests contained more nitrogen but it was mineralized at a lower rate. Changes in the soil properties of ant nests as compared with the surrounding soil were significantly influenced by the size of ant colonies. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Subsidence Rates of Drained Agricultural Peatlands in New Zealand and
   the Relationship with Time since Drainage
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

DT Article
ID CARBON LOSS; PEAT SOILS; ORGANIC SOILS; LAND SUBSIDENCE; WASTAGE;
   PASTURE; AREA
AB The drainage and conversion of peatlands to productive agro-ecosystems leads to ongoing surface subsidence because of densification (shrinkage and consolidation) and oxidation of the peat substrate. Knowing the rate of this surface subsidence is important for future land-use planning, carbon accounting, and economic analysis of drainage and pumping costs. We measured subsidence rates over the past decade at 119 sites across three large, agriculturally managed peatlands in the Waikato region, New Zealand. The average contemporary (2000s-2012) subsidence rate for Waikato peatlands was 19 +/- 2 mm yr(-1) (+/- SE) and was significantly less (p = 0.01) than the historic rate of 26 +/- 1 mm yr(-1) between the 1920s and 2000s. A reduction in the rate of subsidence through time was attributed to the transition from rapid initial consolidation and shrinkage to slower, long-term, ongoing oxidation. These subsidence rates agree well with a literature synthesis of temperate zone subsidence rates reported for similar lengths of time since drainage. A strong nonlinear relationship was found between temperate zone subsidence rates and time since initial peatland drainage: Subsidence (mm yr(-1)) = 226 x (years since drained)(-0.59) (R-2 = 0.88). This relationship suggests that time since drainage exerts strong control over the rate of peatland subsidence and that ongoing peatland subsidence rates can be predicted to gradually decline with time in the absence of major land disturbance.

AB Peatlands are unique wetland ecosystems that cover approximately 3% of the world's land area and are mostly located in boreal and temperate regions. Around 15 Mha of these peatlands have been drained for forestry during the last century. This study investigated soil archaeal and bacterial community structure and abundance, as well as the abundance of marker genes of nitrogen transformation processes (nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia) across distance gradients from drainage ditches in nine full-drained, middle-aged peatland forests dominated by Scots pine, Norway spruce, or Downy birch. The dominating tree species had a strong effect on the chemical properties (pH, N and C/N status) of initially similar Histosols and affected the bacterial and archaeal community structure and abundance of microbial groups involved in the soil nitrogen cycle. The pine forests were distinguished by having the lowest fine root biomass of trees, pH, and N content and the highest potential for N fixation. The distance from drainage ditches affected the spatial distribution of bacterial and archaeal communities (especially N-fixers, nitrifiers, and denitrifiers possessing nosZ clade II), but this effect was often dependent on the conditions created by the dominance of certain tree species. The composition of the nitrifying microbial community was dependent on the soil pH, and comammox bacteria contributed significantly to nitrate formation in the birch and spruce soils where the pH was higher than 4.6. The highest N2O emission was recorded from soils with higher bacterial and archaeal phylogenetic diversity such as birch forest soils. This study demonstrates that the long-term growth of forests dominated by birch, pine, and spruce on initially similar organic soil has resulted in tree-species-specific changes in the soil properties and the development of forest-type-specific soil prokaryotic communities with characteristic functional properties and relationships within microbial communities.

AB The study was carried out in a raised bog located in the Kamanos state reserve in northwestern Lithuania (56 degrees 16'N, 22 degrees 39'W). The area of the raised bog is 1722 ha. To assess the effect of meteorological factors and damming of drainage ditches oil the water regime of the Kamanos mire, we have analysed the water table depth fluctuations over the last 22 years in the northern part of the mire. which was drained out in 1907, and the drainage ditch was dammed in 1999. The control plots were established in the central part of the raised bog without draining activities, where Eriophorum vaginatum-Sphagnum spp. communities prevail in the ground vegetation and small Scots pine trees may also be found.
   The results showed that, in both natural and damaged-by-drainage sites of the raised bog, the air moisture deficiency and the amount of precipitation had a significant effect oil the fluctuation Of the water table depth during the growth period (R(2) = 0.4 16 - 0.761 p < 0.05). In comparison with the control plots, in 7 years after establishing dams in a 0.9-1.2 in deep ditch, the groundwater table increased by 9.8 to 12.2 cm in the area up to 980 in apart from the ditch, After damming the ditches in the extensively and intensively drained parts of the raised bog, the levelling out of the water table to a similar depth as in the control plots, occurred within 4 years and is forecasted to occur within 12 years, respectively. The water table of the drained sites of the raised bog was more sensitive to increasing annual temperatures than the water table in the undrained sites of the raised bog.

AB It is anticipated that a lowering of the water table and reduced soil moisture levels in peatlands may increase peat decomposition rates and consequently affect nutrient availability. However, it is not clear if patterns will be consistent across different peatland types or within peatlands given the natural range of ecohydrological conditions within these systems. We examined the effect of persistent drought on peatland nutrient dynamics by quantifying the effects of an experimentally lowered water table position (drained for a 10-year period) on peat KCl-extractable total inorganic nitrogen (ext-TIN), peat KCl-extractable nitrate (ext-NO3 (-)), and water-extractable ortho-phosphorus (ext-PO4 (3-)) concentrations and net phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) mineralization and nitrification rates at natural (control) and drained microforms (hummocks, lawns) of a bog and poor fen near Qu,bec City, Canada. Drainage (water table drawdown) decreased net nitrification rates across the landscape and increased ext-NO3 (-) concentrations, but did not affect net N and P mineralization rates or ext-TIN and ext-PO4 (3-) concentrations. We suggest that the thick capillary fringe at the drained peatland likely maintained sufficient moisture above the water table to limit the effects of drainage on microbial activity, and a 20 cm lowering of the water table does not appear to have been sufficient to create a clear difference in nutrient dynamics in this peatland landscape. We found some evidence of differences in nutrient concentrations with microforms, where concentrations were greater in lawn than hummock microforms at control sites indicating some translocation of nutrients. In general, the same microtopographic differences were not observed at drained sites. The general spatial patterns in nutrient concentrations did not reflect net mineralization/immobilization rates measured at our control or drained peatlands. Rather, the spatial patterns in nutrient availability may be regulated by differences in vegetation (mainly Sphagnum moss) cover between control and drained sites and possibly differences in hydrologic connection between microforms. Our results suggest that microform distribution and composition within a peatland may be important for determining how peatland nutrient dynamics will respond to water table drawdown in northern peatlands, as some evidence of microtopographic differences in nutrient dynamics was found.

SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN
AB Foliar responses to thinning in midrotation stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were studied in six thinning experiments (0-50% of basal area removed) established on drained peatlands in northern Finland and southern Sweden. The trophic level of the sites varied from ombrotrophic to meso-eutrophic. Needle sampling and analyses were carried out on individual trees of dominant and suppressed canopy layers. The variation in the needle dry mass and in the element concentrations and contents, calculated as plot means, was explained by thinning treatment, blocking by site groups and randoming blocking within the site. Thinning increased foliar concentrations of P, needle size, and contents of N, P, and K in all the canopy layers. It was concluded that thinning improved the foliar nutrient status by reducing the competition for nutrients.

AB Forestry-drained peatlands in the boreal region are currently undergoing restoration in order to bring these ecosystems closer to their natural (undrained) state. Drainage affects the methane (CH4) dynamics of a peatland, often changing sites from CH4 sources to sinks. Successful restoration of a peatland would include restoration of not only the surface vegetation and hydrology, but also the microbial populations and thus CH4 dynamics. As a pilot study, CH4 emissions were measured on two pristine, two drained and three restored boreal spruce swamps in southern Finland for one growing season. Restoration was successful in the sense that the water table level in the restored sites was significantly higher than in the drained sites, but it was also slightly higher than in the pristine sites. The restored sites were surprisingly large sources of CH4 (mean emissions of 52.84 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)), contrasting with both the pristine (1.51 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) and the drained sites (2.09 mg CH4 m-(2) d(-1)). More research is needed to assess whether the high CH4 emissions observed in this study are representative of restored spruce mires in general.

AB We investigated the structural dynamics of naturally established stands dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) on peatland sites drained for forestry. The study was based on 3-10 repeated measurements of the distributions of tree diameters at breast height (DBH) of 83 stands located in southern and central Finland. Thinned as well as unthinned stands were included. Site nutrient levels ranged from poor (ombrotrophic) to moderately rich (mesotrophic). The Weibull function was used to parameterize the DBH distributions, and mixed linear models were constructed to characterize the impacts of different ecological factors and management on stand dynamics as described by the variation of the shape parameter of the Weibull function. The analyses were carried out separately for the dominant canopy layer and the under-Storey. The structural unevenness of the stands, indicated by positive skewness of the DBH distributions. initially increased after drainage. Ingrowth of new trees was enhanced more on sparsely forested composite peatland sites (Group II sites) than on more fully stocked sites (Group I sites). Structural heterogeneity started to decrease 20-30 years after drainage, depending on the site type. DBH distributions continued to develop towards normality and then to negative skewness. This trend reflected inherent stand dynamics mediated by increased inter-tree competition. which resulted in mortality of small trees. Thinnings hastened the change in DBH distributions. Highly uneven-sized understories of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. (Karst.)) and pubescent birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) became established beneath the dominant canopy layer of Group B sites.

AB Drained peatland forests form an important timber resource in Finland. They also form a sink for atmospheric carbon (C) because of the increased growth and C sequestration rates following drainage. These rates have, however, been poorly quantified. We simulated the tree stand dynamics for drained peatland stands with and without cuttings over two stand rotations. Simulations were done on four peatland site types and two regions in Finland with different climatic conditions, using recently published peatland tree growth models applied in a stand simulator. We then calculated the amount of C stored in the stands on the basis of previously published tree-level biomass and C content models. Finally, we developed regression models to estimate C stores in the tree stands using stand stem volume as the predictor variable. In the managed stands, the mean growth (annual volume increment) ranged from 2 to 9 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1), depending on the rotation (first/second), site type and region. Total yield during one rotation varied from 250 to 970 m(3) ha(-1). The maximum stand volumes varied from 220 to 520 m(3) ha(-1) in the managed stands and from 360 to 770 m(3) ha(-1) in the unmanaged. By the end of the first post-drainage rotation the total C store in the managed stands had increased by 6-12 kg C m(-2) (i.e. 45-140 g C m(-2) a(-1)) compared to that in the undrained situation. Averaged over two rotations, the increase in the total C store was 3-6 kg C m(-2). in the corresponding unmanaged stands the C stores increased by 8-15 kg m(-2) over the same periods. At stand level, the C stores were almost linearly related to the stern volume and the developed regression equations could explain the variation in the simulated C stores almost entirely.

AB Of all terrestrial ecosystems, peatlands store carbon most effectively in long-term scales of millennia. However, many peatlands have been drained for peat extraction or agricultural use. This converts peatlands from sinks to sources of carbon, causing approx. 5% of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect and additional negative effects on other ecosystem services. Rewetting peatlands can mitigate climate change and may be combined with management in the form of paludiculture. Rewetted peatlands, however, do not equal their pristine ancestors and their ecological functioning is not understood. This holds true especially for groundwater-fed fens. Their functioning results from manifold interactions and can only be understood following an integrative approach of many relevant fields of science, which we merge in the interdisciplinary project WETSCAPES. Here, we address interactions among water transport and chemistry, primary production, peat formation, matter transformation and transport, microbial community, and greenhouse gas exchange using state of the art methods. We record data on six study sites spread across three common fen types (Alder forest, percolation fen, and coastal fen), each in drained and rewetted states. First results revealed that indicators reflecting more long-term effects like vegetation and soil chemistry showed a stronger differentiation between drained and rewetted states than variables with a more immediate reaction to environmental change, like greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Variations in microbial community composition explained differences in soil chemical data as well as vegetation composition and GHG exchange. We show the importance of developing an integrative understanding of managed fen peatlands and their ecosystem functioning.

AB This study measures the complete carbon budget of a drained peat-covered catchment. It includes dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved CO(2), primary pro-ductivity, soil respiration of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and methane (CH(4)) in contrast to other studies which have focused on only some of the possible carbon uptake and release pathways; values for rainfall inputs were taken from a nearby catchment. The study is based on data collected over 2 yr for two drain catchments within one site and the main findings are:
   1. The catchments were a net source of all forms of carbon at between +63.8 and +106.8 Mg C/km2/yr;
   2. There was a net loss of between +9.3 and +40.7 Mg C/km2/yr in terms of exchange of carbon with the atmosphere;
   3. The small size of the study catchments seems to have resulted in higher values of exported DOC than recorded elsewhere and the highly disturbed drainage of the site may have given rise to losses in net ecosystem exchange (NEE).
   If the fate of the peatland carbon store is to be understood, then it is important that all carbon uptake and release pathways are considered and not just components of the carbon cycle.

AB To assess the effect of peatland type and of forest-drainage performed 30 yr earlier on the occurrence of mycobacteria in runoff-waters, the counts of culturable mycobacteria were followed during a snow-free season. Runoff-waters were from a natural and a drained peatland and each had a different nutrient status. Samples were collected in May, June, August, and October of 1992. Mycobacteria were isolated from all waters. The highest culturable counts were detected in August (up to 7.3 x 10(3) CFU/L). The runoff waters from the two natural peatlands had similar median counts, whereas lowering of the water table by drainage slightly increased the mycobacterial counts in most cases. Changes in vegetation, such as a decrease in the coverage of Sphagnum species, or soil characteristics following drainage had little effect on the occurrence of mycobacteria in the runoff-waters, even though Sphagnum vegetation has been regarded as important for the growth of these bacteria. The counts of mycobacteria in the runoff-waters correlated with precipitation but not with air temperature. This indicates that the mycobacterial growth took plate mainly in vegetation and soil, not in the runoff-waters. when total runoff during May to October nas taken into account, the leaching rates of mycobacteria from all catchments were about 4 to 5 x 10(11) CFU km(-2). Thus drainage had a negligible effect on the leaching of mycobacteria from peatlands.

AB Young coastal fens are rare ecosystems in the first stages of peatland succession. Their drainage compromises their successional development toward future carbon (C) reservoirs. We present the first study on the success of hydrological restoration of young fens. We carried out vegetation surveys at six young fens that represent undrained, drained, and restored management categories in the Finnish land uplift coast before and after restoration. We measured plant level carbon dioxide (CO2) assimilation and chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) from 17 most common plant species present at the sites. Within 5 years of restoration, the vegetation composition of restored sites had started to move toward the undrained baseline. The cover of sedges increased the most in response to restoration, while the cover of deciduous shrubs decreased the most. The rapid response indicates high resilience and low resistance of young fen ecosystems toward changes in hydrology. Forbs had higher photosynthetic and respiration rates than sedges, deciduous shrubs, and grasses, whereas rates were lowest for evergreen shrubs and mosses. The impact of management category on CO2 assimilation was an indirect consequence that occurred through changes in plant species composition: Increase in sedge cover following restoration also increased the potential photosynthetic capacity of the ecosystem. Synthesis and applications. Restoration of forestry drained young fens is a promising method for safeguarding them and bringing back their function as C reservoirs. However, their low resistance to water table draw down introduces a risk that regeneration may be partially hindered by the heavy drainage in the surrounding landscape. Therefore, restoration success is best safeguarded by managing the whole catchments instead of carrying out small-scale projects.

AB Peatlands play an essential role in the global carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. In order to ascertain the draining effects on recent accumulation rates of C (RERCA) and N (RERNA) in the Zoige peatland in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the core samples of peat growth, C and N accumulation for both natural and drained peatlands were measured using Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating methods. As a result, RERCA and RERNA showed an increasing trend from the bottom to the surface of the peatland, which was in accordance with the peat accumulation rates. However, the average RERCA in permanently flooded and seasonally flooded peatlands were 1.5-2.5 times that of drainage peatlands, and the average of RERNA were 1.2-1.7 times. Our findings indicate that the Zoige peatland is still in the stage of peat development with a large carbon sequestration capacity, and drainage from human activities leads to the decreasing of RERCA and RERNA, which will contribute to the selection of the effective ways to slow down the anthropogenic effects on the degradation of the Zoige peatland.

AB Restoration of damaged ecosystems has become an important tool to slow down biodiversity loss and to maintain ecosystem services. Peatland bird populations have shown a substantial decline during the recent decades in Northern Europe as a consequence of peatland drainage. We studied whether restoration of peatlands drained for forestry affects bird communities. We conducted bird surveys at 11 peatlands in Western Finland, where each of the restored and their pristine counterparts were surveyed before restoration and yearly after restoration during 2010-2018. We used linear mixed effect models to analyze whether restoration affected the number of species and territories of peatland specialist and non-specialist species and permutational multivariate analysis of variance to analyze the change in community composition. Drained parts of the peatlands had higher number of territories of non-specialist species before restoration, and restoration seemed to decrease these numbers towards the level of pristine parts. By contrast, restoration did not affect the number of peatland specialists and their territories, which was lower in drained than in pristine parts of the peatlands. Bird communities in restored parts remained different from pristine parts in terms of community composition after restoration. Thus, despite the effect of restoration on non-specialists, a substantially long time may be required for a recovery of the peatland bird communities. Based on our results, it seems that long-term monitoring of the restored and pristine peatlands is needed to determine whether restoration is effective in recovering the peatland specialist bird species and bird communities in general.

AB A description of bog pine stands (Pinus uncinata Ramond var. rotundata (Link) Antoine) on uncut oligotrophic mires affected by drainage and nearby peat cuttings at three sites of the Jura Mountains (Switzerland) is given. In all sites, three situations were chosen: (i) central parts of the bogs, (ii) surfaces near cutting walls and bog margins, and (iii) intermediate situations. Population structures were characteristic for each situation. In the open and wet central parts of the bogs, trees were scattered, small, and uneven aged. In the intermediate situations, tree density was higher, and the stand was multilayered with taller and uneven-aged individuals. Near the edges of the bogs or close to the peat cutting walls, the trees were tall, even-aged, and younger with a high growth rate. The nonsynchronous colonization of the bog pine trees on the three sites indicates that local factors such as drainage and peat cuttings in the vicinity of the uncut surfaces were more influential than climate factors. Radial growth patterns, very similar between the sites and the various pinewood stands, and the numerous common pointer years reflect local and regional climate fluctuations. The pinewood development on uncut bogs in the Jura Mountains thus represents a recent dynamics, which is strongly linked to human activities.

AB Combustion of peat leads to emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. In addition, mining of the peat alters the environment such that the natural fluxes of CO2 and other greenhouse gases are modified. Of particular interest is a reduction in the emission of methane (CH4) in the drained parts of the mires. We estimate the total impact on the greenhouse effect of these processes. The results indicate that the decreased emission of methane from the drained mires compensates for about 15% of the CO2 emission during the combustion of the peat. It follows that, in a time perspective of less than several hundred years, peat is comparable to a fossil fuel, as far as the contribution to the greenhouse effect is concerned.

AB Natural peatlands are known as an important source of methane (CH4). However, most peatlands in Central Europe were drained for forestry purposes in the past and some of them have been recently restored, both having a strong impact on CH4 emissions. The main aim of our study was to determine the effect of long-term drainage (a few decades) and hydrological restoration (3 years) on CH4 emissions, potential CH4 production and on the methanogenic Archaea community in different types of peatlands under various hydrological regimes. For this purpose, CH4 emissions together with biotic and abiotic variables were measured over three growing seasons, in vitro potential CH4 production was determined, and qPCR and DGGE fingerprinting were used for methanogenic community description in three ombrotrophic bogs (pristine, drained, restored) and two fens (pristine, drained) located in the umava National Park within the Bohemian Forest, Czech Republic. The highest CH4 emissions, CH4 potential production, and the highest diversity of the methanogenic community were observed in the pristine fen and bog. In the frame of interannual variability, a drought period seemed to play an important role in seasonal CH4 fluxes. Plant species composition together with water table seemed to be the most important factors controlling CH4 emission. Drainage led to a significant decrease in CH4 emissions, potential CH4 production, and the abundance and diversity of methanogens as compared to pristine sites. These post-drainage changes were more obvious in the fen site than on bog sites. However, none of the measured parameters showed significant changes during the 3 years after rewetting. We assume that the restored hydrology was not the main factor controlling CH4 emissions and other factors such as vegetation composition and input of available substrate for methanogenic community were more important. Therefore it appears that the period necessary for regeneration of CH4 emissions is the result of restoring all of these elementary factors together.

AB This study presents the results of an investigation of drainage effects of the Romeriksporten railway tunnel on peatlands in the Lake Northern Puttjern area. Drainage impacts on peatlands occurred in marked depressions reflecting faults or weakness zones in bedrocks. The impacts were most evident near the tunnel trace, but dry peatlands and streams were observed as far as 600 m from the tunnel trace. Several types of drainage effects were observed on peatland surfaces after tunnelling; surface subsidence and formation of local depressions, peat slides, peat cracking, dry peat holes, and death of vegetation. The effects depended clearly on peatland properties. The greatest and most damaging effects were associated with thick peat layers around open water surface. Here lowering of the water table caused peat slides. Such areas will generally be extremely vulnerable to lowering of the water level. The magnitude of subsidence of peatlands depends on peat thickness, peat decomposition and groundwater lowering. Even after seven years with artificial infiltration in bedrock wells in dry periods to counteract water table lowering, peat subsidence and peat slides were evident, demonstrating that temporary draw down of water can result in irreversible impacts on peatlands. To better be able to avoid damaging effects of tunnel drainage on environment, investigations of properties of peatlands above possible tunnel traces should be integrated in the planning procedure for tunnel constructions. In mires above such traces, the occurrence of floating peat mats, degree of peat decomposition, peat thickness, deliveries of water from surrounding catchments in dry periods and possible pathways of leakage through subsoils and bedrocks should be examined as basis for assessment of vulnerability of peatlands to tunnel drainage and selection of tunnel traces that evade the most vulnerable peatlands. When such areas can not be avoided, requirements should be set to the tightening of the tunnel to prevent damaging water draw downs in dry periods. Observations of drainage effects on peatland surfaces can complement hydrological information from measurements of tunnel leakages and groundwater levels and thus contribute to provide a broader picture of hydrological impacts and bedrock hydrogeology.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) fluxes from three different peat soil sites during 1992-94 were studied. There was no detectable NO emission from a virgin mire. The average emission of NO-N from a drained peat soil site used for grass cultivation was 64 mu g N m(-2) h(-1). On the same field a plot with no grass cover emitted on an average 300 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1). The average emission from a drained and forested mire site was 5.8 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1). Lowering of water table seems to be needed for emissions of NO from peat soils. Cultivation practises increase the emissions of NO more than draining for forestry. Considering their large area in the northern latitudes, organic soils are potential sources of NO among other biogenic sources.

AB The lowering of the water table resulting from peatland drainage may dramatically alter C and N cycling in peatland ecosystems, which contain one-third of the total terrestrial C. In this study, tree annual ring width and C (delta C-13) and N (delta N-15) isotope ratios in soil and plant tissues ( tree foliage, growth rings, and understory foliage) in a black spruce-tamarack ( Picea mariana-Larix laricina) mixed-wood forest were examined to study the effects of drainage on tree growth and C and N dynamics in a minerotrophic peatland in west-central Alberta, Canada. Drainage increased the delta N-15 of soil NH4+ from a range of +0.6 parts per thousand to +2.9 parts per thousand to a range of +4.6 parts per thousand to +7.0 parts per thousand most likely through increased nitrification following enhanced mineralization. Plant uptake of N-15-enriched NH4+ in the drained treatment resulted in higher plant delta N-15 (+0.8 parts per thousand to +1.8 parts per thousand in the drained plots and -3.9 parts per thousand to -5.4 parts per thousand in the undrained plots), and deposition of litterfall N enriched with N-15 increased the delta N-15 of total soil N in the surface layer in the drained (+2.9 parts per thousand) as compared with that in the undrained plots ( +0.6 parts per thousand). The effect of drainage on foliar delta C-13 was species-specicfic, i.e., only tamarack showed a considerably less negative foliar delta C-13 in the drained (-28.1 parts per thousand) than in the undrained plots (-29.1 parts per thousand), indicating improved water use efficiency (WUE) by drainage. Tree ring area increments were significantly increased following drainage, and delta C-13 and delta N-15 in tree growth rings of both species showed responses to drainage retrospectively. Tree-ring delta C-13 data suggested that drainage improved WUE of both species, with a greater and more prolonged response in tamarack than in black spruce. Our results indicate that drainage caused the studied minerotrophic peatland to become a more open ecosystem in terms of C and N cycling and loss. The effects of forested peatland drainage or drying on C and N balances deserve further research in order to better understand their roles in future global change.

AB The study was conducted in the raised bog Kusowo (Baltic region, West Pomerania, Poland). Along a transect line crossing two open mires affected by forest succession we analysed tree age distribution. One of those mires had been drained in the past years and still retained some open ditches, while the other one was located far from the ditches. Every 10 meters along the transect line one tree was drilled at the root collar in order to determine its age. We also conducted phytosociological analyses and short-term water level measurements in the sample plots. We expected faster tree encroachment in the undisturbed part of the open mire. The results showed, that there were no significant differences in water table level and in soil moisture indicator values between the formerly drained and undisturbed open mire. There were also no statistically significant differences in tree encroachment between the disturbed and undisturbed mires. Location and the age distribution of the trees suggest that changes in the tree growth conditions cannot be directly explained by the general decreasing of water level in the bog, although periods following drainage works were associated with more numerous establishment of young trees, in the drained part of the bog as well as in the part not directly affected by drainage ditches.

TI The formation of profile in drained peaty soils under agricultural use
SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Drainage and agricultural use of peaty soils result in the compaction of peat, an increase in its ash content, decrease in its water-retaining capacity, and peat exhaustion. The duration of these processes depends on depletion the original thickness of the peat deposit and the management practices. A decrease in thickness of the peat deposit approximating the thickness of the arable layer, as well as the growth of tilled crops, can accelerate these processes; the use of lands for meadows inhibits them. As the underlying horizon becomes depleted in organic matter, the profile of peaty soils incorporates mineral layers. On these soils, the yield of cereals increases, and the yield of perennial grasses decreases. In order to increase the grass yield, the depth of the groundwater table should be regulated, and additional nitrogen fertilizers should be applied.

AB Large peatland areas have been drained for forestry and agricultural purposes, resulting in the decline of characteristic biodiversity. Two measures commonly suggested for restoring drained fens is ditch blocking and tree removal to raise the groundwater table and increase light availability, respectively. In 2002, we initiated factorial restoration experiments, including ditch blocking and tree removal, in three former rich fens that had been drained for forestry purposes. Species cover of vascular plants and bryophytes were monitored during 8 years in permanent plots along transects perpendicular to the ditch for all four treatment combinations. Both methods had positive and independent effects on the cover of wetland vegetation. Specifically, Sphagnum species and wetland bryophytes showed a persistent positive response to both clear cutting and rewetting. Wetland vascular plants and grasses showed a persistent positive response to clear cutting. Sedges and species number responded positively to both clear cutting and ditch blocking, but the response was partly transient, and for species richness the response was limited when restoration methods were applied separately. Rich fen indicators of vascular plants and bryophytes did not respond to any of the restoration treatments. This indicates that species introduction in combination with further habitat restorations may be necessary to re-establish the original rich fen flora. Nevertheless, we conclude that the combination of ditch blocking and clear cutting are effective measures to partly restore wetland vegetation on previously drained and forested fens, while peat subsidence along the ditch may restrict the success further away from ditches.

AB Data of Nitrogen fertilisation experiments of 1934-1994 have been analysed, using models for N uptake and DM yield. Both models were affected by fertiliser level, soil type, soil organic matter content, grassland use, cutting frequency, grassland renovation, white clover content and the N content analysis (Crude Protein or total-N). Effects on Soil Nitrogen Supply (SNS), Apparent Nitrogen Recovery (ANR) and Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE) are discussed.
   Differences in SNS, ANR and NLTE between sand and clay were small, SNS on poorly drained peat soil was 60 and 80 kg N per ha higher than on clay and sand, respectively, ANR on poorly drained peat soil was 7 and 10% lower. The NUE was similar on sand, clay and poorly drained peat.
   ANR was low at low N application levels, due to immobilisation. ANR increased from 35% to 65% at application levels of 50 and 250 kg N per ha, respectively. At application levels of more than 250 kg N per ha, ANR decreased. NUE decreased from 45 to 29 kg DM per kg N with increasing N application levels of 0 and 550 kg per ha. It is suggested that for a good N utilisation a minimum N application of 100 kg N per ha should be used. SNS increased by a mixed use of grazing and cutting with 27 and 40 kg N per ha for sand/clay and poorly drained peat respectively. ANR on sand decreased from 5 to 10% at applications of 200 and 500 kg N per ha and NUE decreased with 1-2 kg DM per kg N. The effect of grazing was stronger under pure grazing than with a mixed use of grazing and cuffing. Increasing the cutting frequency from 3 to 8 cuts per year had no effect on SNS, increased ANR with 0-20% and decreased NUE with 4-7 kg DM per kg N. The positive effect of the higher ANR compensated the lower NUE at application levels of 400 kg N per ha. Changes in ANR over the last sixty years can be explained by changes in experimental conditions, experimental treatments and chemical analysis. Changes in NUE can be explained by a higher proportion of perennial ryegrass and genetic improvement.

AB The focus of current water management in drained peatlands is to facilitate optimal drainage, which has led to soil subsidence and a strong increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Dutch land and water authorities proposed the application of subsoil irrigation (SSI) system on a large scale to potentially reduce GHG emissions, while maintaining high biomass production. Based on model results, the expectation was that SSI would reduce peat decomposition in summer by preventing groundwater tables (GWTs) from dropping below -60 cm. In 2017-2018, we evaluated the effects of SSI on GHG emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O) for four dairy farms on drained peat meadows in the Netherlands. Each farm had a treatment site with SSI installation and a control site drained only by ditches (ditch water level -60 / -90 cm, 100 m distance between ditches). The SSI system consisted of perforated pipes -70 cm from surface level with spacing of 5-6 m to improve drainage during winter-spring and irrigation in summer. GHG emissions were measured using closed chambers every 2-4 weeks for CO2, CH4 and N2O. Measured ecosystem respiration (R-eco) only showed a small difference between SSI and control sites when the GWT of SSI sites were substantially higher than the control site (> 20 cm difference). Over all years and locations, however, there was no significant difference found, despite the 6-18 cm higher GWT in summer and 1-20 cm lower GWT in wet conditions at SSI sites. Differences in mean annual GWT remained low (< 5 cm). Direct comparison of measured N2O and CH4 fluxes between SSI and control sites did not show any significant differences. CO2 fluxes varied according to temperature and management events, while differences between control and SSI sites remained small. Therefore, there was no difference between the annual gap-filled net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the SSI and control sites. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was on average 40 and 30 t CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1) in 2017 and 2018 on the SSI sites and 38 and 34 t CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1 )in 2017 and 2018 on the control sites. This lack of SSI effect is probably because the GWT increase remains limited to deeper soil layers (60-120 cm depth), which contribute little to peat oxidation.
   We conclude that SSI modulates water table dynamics but fails to lower annual carbon emission. SSI seems unsuitable as a climate mitigation strategy. Future research should focus on potential effects of GWT manipulation in the uppermost organic layers (-30 cm and higher) on GHG emissions from drained peatlands.

AB Sediment surface samples (0-2 cm) from 66 sites, and longer cores (up to 540 cm) from 9 sites in the estuary of the river Kyronjoki, Western Finland, were analysed for organic content, P, Fe, Mn, Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn.  One core was dated on the basis of annual laminations.
   Chemical analyses of the cores showed that organic matter and heavy metal content have increased in recent decades.  The heavy metal content was clearly lower than in areas polluted by industry.  The sedimentation rate in the delta increased between the 1930s and 1950.  It decreased in the 1960s, and has been below 1930s levels since 1970.  The sedimentation rates of organic matter were fairly stable all through the period measured, even though the organic content increased.
   The increase in organic matter and the heavy metal content of the sediment in recent decades is evidently due to the increased intensity of agriculture, forestry and peat harvesting in the drainage basin.  Drainage of peatlands in particular has increased erosion and the organic sediment load of the river.  Reservoir building after 1970 has decreased the sedimentation rates in the delta.

AB Under natural conditions, peatlands are generally nitrate-limited. However, recent concerns about an additional N input into peatlands by atmospheric N deposition have highlighted the risk of an increased denitrification activity and hence the likelihood of a rise of emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the turnover of added nitrate in a drained and a rewetted peatland using a [N-15]nitrate-bromide double-tracer method. The double-tracer method allows a separation between physical effects (dilution, dispersion and dislocation) and microbial and chemical nitrate transformation by comparing with the conservative Br- tracer. In the drained peat site, low NO3- consumption rates have been observed. In contrast, NO3- consumption at the rewetted peat site rises rapidly to about 100% within 4 days after tracer application. Concomitantly, the N-15 abundances of nitrite and ammonium in soil water increased and lead to the conclusion that, besides commonly known NO3- reduction to nitrite (i.e. denitrification), a dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium has simultaneously taken place. The present study reveals that increasing NO3- inputs into rewetted peatlands via atmospheric deposition results in a rapid NO3- consumption, which could lead to an increase in N2O emissions into the atmosphere.

AB Continuous cover management on peatland forests has gained interest in recent years, in part because the tree biomass with significant evapotranspiration capacity retained in selection cuttings could be used as a tool to optimize the site water table level (WTL) from both tree growth and environmental perspectives. This study reports WTL responses from six field trials established on fertile Norway spruce-dominated drained peatland forests across Finland. At each site, replicates of different intensity selection cuttings (removing 17-74% of the stand basal area) or clear-cut in parallel with intact control stands were established and monitored for the WTL for 2-5 postharvest years. The observed WTL rose after selection cuttings, and the response increased with harvest intensity and depended on the reference WTL; that is, larger responses were found during dry summers or in more southern location. Selection cuttings removing about 50% of the stand basal area raised the WTL typically by 15-40%. Using a process-based ecohydrological model, tested against data from the field trials, we show that the role of tree stand in controlling the WTL clearly decreases along the latitudinal climate gradient in Finland. This suggests that the potential of controlling WTL using selection cuttings is more prominent in southern than in northern Finland. Predictions with future climate (2070-2099) further indicated a general decrease of the WTL and that the importance of the tree stand in controlling the WTL will increase, especially in northern Finland. The results overall thus suggest that selection cuttings can be used as a tool to control the WTL in boreal drained peatland forests, and the potential is likely to increase in future climate.

AB This study compared dry matter production, nutrient uptake and tissue nutrient concentration of two C4 turfgrass species (Cynodon dactylon x Cynodon transvaalensis Burtt Davy and Paspalum vaginatum Swartz) supplied with three different nutrient solutions in a sand and peat culture. The 8-week experiment was performed in mesocosms and simulated the conditions of an open-field phyto-treatment system located in a Mediterranean drained peatland (Tuscany, Italy). Peat was collected on the site, and one of the solutions mimicked drainage water flowing into it. Three hypotheses were tested: (i) the species chosen efficiently removed nutrients from both the solution and the substrate; (ii) peat contributed to the nutrient load; and (iii) the species chosen were suitable in the open-field system. Both species adapted well to the experimental conditions and demonstrated considerable ability to remove nutrients. P. vaginatum took up nitrogen more efficiently, mainly in conditions of high nutrient availability. We observed supplementary nutrient uptake by plants in the peat treatment. Performances of the two C4 turfgrasses extrapolated to the field scale seemed effective from a phyto-treatment perspective.

AB Peatlands provide habitats for many species and a variety of ecosystem services worldwide. In this study we used an integrated biophysical-economic modeling approach with multi-objective optimization to investigate how alternative land-use and land-management (LULM) options jointly affect economic returns from marketed (timber, energy peat, restoration costs) and non-marketed public goods (water quality, GHG emissions, biodiversity) in a typical landscape dominated by peatlands in northern Finland. We considered several LULM options including no action (the current state will continue), bioenergy wood harvesting, intensive forest management, restoration, and energy peat extraction with three after use options (no after use, reforestation, rewetting). Our study revealed strong tradeoffs between biodiversity and ecosystem services in drained peatlands. Optimal LULM depended strongly on the chosen objectives, i.e. whether marketed or non-marketed goods were preferred. For example, when the objective was carbon neutral land-use, the no action option was mostly chosen, while bioenergy wood harvesting was mostly chosen when the objective was to provide economic and environmental benefits at the same time. The strong tradeoff between biodiversity and ecosystem services indicates that compromises are unavoidable in order to obtain a multi-functional landscape which provides biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation and water protection in a cost-effective manner.

AB Mire degradation due to drainage for forestry results in the loss of mire specialist species. To halt the loss in biodiversity, ecological restoration is needed and already implemented. However, a major challenge in ecological restoration is whether actions taken have the desired outcome. Key abiotic and biotic conditions for the successful restoration of invertebrate communities can be identified by testing the "Field of Dreams" hypothesis, which postulates that if a habitat is successfully restored, species will return. This study was conducted in nine boreal mires located in Eastern Finland, 1-3 years after restoration. Parts of each mire were drained for forestry during the 1960s and 1970s, and restored in 2003-2006. Two 250m transects were established in each of three treatments (pristine, drained, restored) per mire. We used pitfall trapping to sample carabid beetles and spiders, sweep netting to sample micromoths and crane flies and counts along the transects to sample macromoths. Vegetation cover, water table level, and climatic variables were measured along all transects. Mire specialist species and invertebrate communities responded positively to restoration and negatively to drainage, whereas generalists showed varied responses. In addition, mire specialists were associated with high cover of Sphagnum mosses and with low numbers of tall trees (>3 m). Therefore, to successfully restore populations and communities of mire specialist invertebrates, maintaining environmental conditions that favor the growth of Sphagnum mosses, rewetting the sites and removing larger trees are necessary measures.

AB Ditch networks in drained peatland forests are maintained regularly to prevent water table rise and subsequent decrease in tree growth. The growing tree stand itself affects the level of water table through evapotranspiration, the magnitude of which is closely related to the living stand volume. In this study, regression analysis was applied to quantify the relationship between the late summer water table depth (D(WT)) and tree stand volume, mean monthly summertime precipitation (P(s)), drainage network condition, and latitude. The analysis was based on several large data sets from southern to northern Finland, including concurrent measurements of stand volume and summer water table depth. The identified model demonstrated a nonlinear effect of stand volume on D(WT), a linear effect of P(s) on D(WT), and an interactive effect of both stand volume and P(s). Latitude and ditch depth showed only marginal influence on D(WT). A separate analysis indicated that an increase of 10 m(3).ha(-1) in stand volume corresponded with a drop of 1 cm in water table level during the growing season. In a subsample of the data, high bulk density peat showed deeper D(WT) than peat with low bulk density at the same stand volume.

TI Correction of a Large-Scale Soil Map with the Use of the New

DT Article
AB A large-scale soil map of one of the farms in the south of Karelia has been analyzed. This map was initially compiled in 1979 on the basis of the official Classification and Diagnostics of Soils of the Soviet Union (1977). We have corrected it with the use of the new Classification and Diagnostics of Russian Soils. Both the names of the map units and the particular delineations on the map have been changed. These changes are related to differences in the principles of soil diagnostics in the old and new classification systems and to real changes in the soil cover that have taken place after the map's compilation. In particular, large areas of peat bogs have been drained, and the cultivated peat soils have been subjected to accelerated mineralization. Surface planing works after digging drainage channels have also changed the soil cover pattern. The revised large-scale soil map developed on the basis of the new classification system gives more adequate information about the real soil cover.

AB The aim of this work was to determine the intensity of nitrogen mineralization in forestry drained ombrotrophic peatland soils in the Stolowe Mountains National Park, SW Poland. Additionally discussion about the shallow organic soils classification according to Polish Soil Classification (2011) is presented. For the study three research transects were established on forestry drained ombrotrophic peatlands in the Stolowe Mountains. Each of the transect consisted of four (site A and B) or five (site C) sampling plots. Sampling was conducted in the year 2012. The soil samples for the basic soil properties analysis were sampled in April, whereas undisturbed soil samples were collected in stainless steel rings (100 cm(3)) every 10 cm in April (spring), July (summer) and October (autumn) to show the seasonal dynamics of nitrogen mineralization. Statistical analysis showed that the content of N-NH4 was mainly determined by actual soil moisture and precipitation rate, whereas the content of N-NO3 was positively correlated with air temperature. Among investigated peatlands the highest concentrations of mineral nitrogen forms was observed in the Dlugie Mokradlo bog, situated on the Skalniak Plateau-summit. Additionally, the results obtained showed that implementation of new subtype: shallow fibric peat soils (in Polish: gleby torfowe fibrowe plytkie) within the type of peat soils (in polish: gleby torfowe) should be considered during developing of the next update of Polish Soil Classification.

AB Drained peatlands are an important source of forest biomass in boreal regions and ditch network maintenance (DNM) operations may be needed to restore the drainage functions of ditches. By reviewing the available literature, as well as utilizing an existing hydrological model and analyzing the characteristics of eroded sediments, we assessed the impacts of DNM on runoff and exports of suspended solids (SS), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). In general, DNM had minor impact on runoff and dissolved N and P, and it decreased rather than increased DOC exports. To increase the understanding of the hydrochemical impacts of DNM, future research should focus on the characteristics of SS and particulate nutrient exports. A major gap in knowledge is also the very limited regional representativeness of the available studies. High erosion risk in the ditches reaching the mineral soil below peat should be acknowledged when planning mitigation measures.

AB There has been increasing interest in potential benefits to be gained by restoring damaged peatlands, with the majority of funding currently being driven by the recovery of protected habitats. However, few data are available linking vegetation community declines with peatland drainage, and so the potential for recovery remains difficult to predict. Surprisingly, there is a similar paucity of research demonstrating the extent of drainage impacts on grazing conditions for livestock, despite this being a priority amongst land managers. We attempt to address these two knowledge gaps, first by investigating whether ditches in blanket bog habitat have improved or increased grazing for sheep, and second by assessing the impact of ditches on the condition of vegetation communities. At an extensively drained upland blanket bog in Wales, currently undergoing ditch blocking restoration, we collected vegetation and sheep occurrence data across five catchments and over 2 years. We present evidence that drained areas had remained relatively wet and were less preferred by sheep. Furthermore, our results show that while sheep preferred graminoid-rich areas, drainage did not increase the abundance of this species group. Drainage at the site has, however, resulted in some degradation in blanket bog vegetation adjacent to ditches; although at the landscape scale, historic high grazing levels appear to explain much of the current poor ecological condition of the site. We conclude that drain-blocking restoration should not reduce sheep grazing conditions beyond their current relatively poor state, and thus in this respect may not represent a threat to hill farming productivity.

AB We studied the consequences of a fire that affected 29 ha of a drained forested raised bog in Tver oblast, Central European Russia. The drainage network consisted of open 1-m-deep ditches with 60 to 160 m ditch spacing. The groundwater level (GWL) varied within the studied drained bog. We used the method of assessing the loss of soil carbon (C) based on the difference between the ash concentration in the burnt peat of the upper layer and underlying unburnt layers. The carbon loss was higher near the drainage ditches than in the sites remote from ditches. The sample median values of carbon loss (kg C/m(2)) were estimated at 0.37 near the drainage ditches and at 0.22 for the remote sites with a distance of 160 m between ditches. They increased to 2.23 and 0.79 near and far from the drainage ditches for 106 m ditch spacing, and ranged from 1.13 to 2.10 near the drainage ditches and were equal to 0.45 at the remote sites for 60 m ditch spacing. The maximum loss of C was at the bog margin with the 70-cm-deep GWL; the sample median was equal to 2.97 kg C/m(2). The results obtained for C loss from the wildfire on the raised bog agree with the estimates obtained by other authors (1.45-4.90 kg C/m(2)) and confirm the importance of taking such loss into account in the estimates of the carbon budget of peat soils (Histosols).

ID INSTITUTIONS; FRAMEWORK
AB Paludiculture is the productive use of wet and rewetted peatlands. A major motivation is climate change, because drained peatlands contribute significant amounts of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The study presents an analysis of paludiculture as a critical sustainability innovation mission in the making. It is based on qualitative interviews conducted in 2018 in the north-east of Germany as well as on subsequent regional and European level stakeholder workshops focused on wet agriculture options for rewetted mires and other types of wetlands. A social grid approach of cognitive frames, institutions and social networks and their interplay is used to analyse paludiculture options for currently drained mires. The analysis suggests a pathway of paludiculture as land use at the margins of intensive, dryland agriculture. It also points to strategies for paludiculture to move from the margin to a transformation pathway, based on the use of framing, institutional conversion and productive niche work. The study proposes a 3Ms-schema of mission, modes and making innovation as a device to create space for a wide and inclusive discussion of paludiculture.

AB Bog ecosystems are sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance, including drainage and air pollution. Carbon (C) balance measurements to determine the effect of disturbance on bog functioning are laborious; therefore reliable proxies for C fluxes that could facilitate upscaling from single studies to a larger scale would be valuable. We measured peat CO2 emissions (R (s)), CH4 efflux and vegetation characteristics in four bog areas that formed a gradient from pristine to severely disturbed peatlands, affected by drainage, peat mining, alkaline air pollution and underground oil-shale mining. We expected that sites experiencing higher human impact (i.e., the vegetation was more distinct from that of a natural bog) would have higher R (s) and lower CH4 emissions, but differences in peat C emissions between the most disturbed and pristine sites were not significant. Growing period median R (s) ranged from 0.5 to 2.2 g C m(-2) day(-1) for our plots; methane emissions, measured from July to December were an order of magnitude lower, ranging from -5.9 to 126.7 mg C m(-2) day(-1). R (s) and CH4 emissions were primarily determined by water table depth, as was tree stand productivity. Therefore, stand structural parameters could potentially be good indicators of soil C emissions from poorly drained forested bogs.

AB We compared different statistical methods for fitting linear regression models to a longitudinal data of breast height diameter (dbh) distributions of Scots pine dominated stands on drained peatlands. The parameter prediction methods for two parameters of Johnson's S-B distribution, fitted to basal-area dbh distributions, were: 1) a linear model estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS), 2) a multivariate linear model estimated using the seemingly unrelated regression approach (SUR), 3) a linear mixed-effects model with random intercept (MIX), and 4) a multivariate mixed-effects model (MSUR). The aim was to clarify the effect of taking into account the hierarchy of the data, as well as simultaneous estimation of the correlated dependent variables on the model fit and predictions. Instead of the reliability of the predicted parameters, we focused on the reliability of the models in predicting stand conditions. Predicted distributions were validated in terms of bias, RMSE, and error deviation in the generated quantities of the growing stock. The study material consisted of 112 successively measured stands from 12 experimental areas covering the whole of Finland (total of 608 observations). Two independent test data sets were used for model validation. All the advanced regression techniques were superior to OLS, when exactly the same independent stand variables were included. SUR and MSUR were ranked the overall best and second best, respectively. Their ranking was the same in the modeling data, whereas MSUR was superior in the peatland test data and SUR in the mineral soil test data. The ranking of the models was logical, but may not be widely generalized. The SUR and MSUR models were considered to be relevant tools for practical forest management planning purposes over a variety of site types and stand structures.

AB Alpine peatlands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are an important soil carbon pool and are extremely sensitive to global change. Duration of drainage and water table drawdown accelerate peatland degradation because the soil changes from an anaerobic to aerobic environment, and climate warming exacerbates this shift. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of drainage on microbial characteristics and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as identify the factors mediating those effects. This study also analyzed whether warming increases the variability of GHG emissions. Watertable drawdown exerted greater influence on microbial communities than duration of drainage did. Watertable drawdown significantly increased the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Basidiomycota, and changes in soil microbiota correlated with differences in GHG emissions across three water-table treatments. Longer drainage was associated with lower GHG emission; watertable drawdown decreased emissions of CO2 and CH4, but increased emission of N2O. In addition, high temperature increased CO2 emission by 75% and N2O emission by 42%, without significantly affecting CH4 emission. Structural equation modelling showed that microbes, especially prokaryotes (r = 0.79, p < 0.05 for all), were the primary factor affecting GHG emissions from drained peatlands. Overall, this study indicates that the watertable exerts a greater effect on GHG emissions than duration of drainage, and that warming increases variability of GHG emissions.

AB The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of boron on nodule development in pea Pisum sativum L. plants cultivated in lowland soils under greenhouse conditions from May to July, 1998. Samples of Alluvial Soil, Low Humic Gley, Humic Gley and artificially drained Bog Soil were collected from a layer 0-20 cm deep. The samples were previously cultivated with radish plants that received lime, P, K, S, Cu and Zn and doses of B (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg dm(-3)). Before pea cultivation only K was applied (100 mg dm(-3)). The experimental design was totally randomized in a factorial scheme 4x6 with three replicates. Seeds were inoculated with Rhizobium leguminosarum strains (BR 618 and BR 619). To verify native strains, three pots of each soil were cultivated without inoculated seeds with same lime and fertilizers doses and 0.5 mg dm-3 of boron. After 45 days, the experiment was harvested. Native strains were not found in the evaluated soils. Boron affected nodule development and nitrogenase activity in the pea plants in Low Humic Gley and artificially drained Bog Soil.

AB The demand for small-sized trees, logging residues, stumps, and lateral roots for energy production has increased during recent decades and therefore whole-tree harvesting (WTH) has become a more common harvesting method in forests. However, this may cause a more pronounced delay in the recovery of forest vegetation than conventional stem-only harvesting (SOH), especially in sensitive peatlands, and thus increase soil erosion. The effects of WTH have not been investigated on peatlands before this study. Recovery of understorey vegetation of drained peatland forests after two different tree harvesting methods, stem-only harvesting and whole-tree harvesting, was investigated in Eastern Finland at eight silviculturally managed peatland forests largely comprising Scots pine, Pima sylvesiris, and Norway spruce, Picea abies. In SOH, trunks only were removed from the sites whereas in WTH, tree trunks, branches, and stumps were removed. In each site, understorey vegetation (tree seedlings, dwarf shrubs, graminoids, herbs, and bryophytes) was inventoried on both mounded and unprepared soil (surfaces) on 220 permanent sample plots one and five years after harvesting. WTH had more pronounced effects on vegetation than SOH. Five to six years after the treatments, the occurrence of dwarf shrubs was lower in WTH than in SOH, whereas the cover of graminoids increased from both SOH and WTH. Soil preparation affected negatively on the recovery of peat and forest bryophytes, but positively on the recovery of some graminoid and herb species. Peat properties, e.g., pH and water table level, were found to regulate the recovery. WTH caused a longer delay on the recovery of understorey vegetation than SOH, especially if soil had been prepared. Thus, WTH cannot be recommended in drained peatland forests.

AB Streams draining peatlands export large quantities of carbon in different chemical forms and are an important part of the carbon cycle. Radiocarbon (C-14) analysis/dating provides unique information on the source and rate that carbon is cycled through ecosystems, as has recently been demonstrated at the air-water interface through analysis of carbon dioxide (CO2) lost from peatland streams by evasion (degassing). Peatland streams also have the potential to release large amounts of methane (CH4) and, though C-14 analysis of CH4 emitted by ebullition (bubbling) has been previously reported, diffusive emissions have not. We describe methods that enable the C-14 analysis of CH4 evaded from peatland streams. Using these methods, we investigated the C-14 age and stable carbon isotope composition of both CH4 and CO2 evaded from a small peatland stream draining a temperate raised mire. Methane was aged between 1617 and 1987 years BP, and was much older than CO2 which had an age range of 303-521 years BP. Isotope mass balance modelling of the results indicated that the CO2 and CH4 evaded from the stream were derived from different source areas, with most evaded CO2 originating from younger layers located nearer the peat surface compared to CH4. The study demonstrates the insight that can be gained into peatland carbon cycling from a methodological development which enables dual isotope (C-14 and C-13) analysis of both CH4 and CO2 collected at the same time and in the same way.

AB A laboratory column study with peats from four sites from south-central Finland and two sites from blanket peats in the west of Ireland was established to assess the factors contributing to P, N, Fe, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) transfer to receiving water courses from restored forestry-drained peatlands. The study indicated that the DOC and Fe release from re-wetted peats are likely governed by the amount of Fe in peat and the degree of Fe reduction upon re-wetting. In contrast to our other hypothesis concerning DOC, high degradability of organic matter was not related to high DOC release. Nitrate release was found to largely cease along with oxygen depletion, but ammonium release was considerable from a site with high nitrification potential before wetting. The release of P from anoxic peat was complicated in the sense that it appeared to be controlled by many factors simultaneously. In the nutrient-poor sites, the P release increased following re-wetting, probably because of their high easily soluble peat P content and low Al and Fe content, resulting in high anoxic P mobilization, but limited re-sorption of the mobilized P. Among the three nutrient-rich sites, there was either no P release upon re-wetting or higher P release than from the nutrient-poor sites. Low risk for P release following re-wetting in nutrient-rich sites was associated with low content in peat of easily soluble P and a high molar Fe/P ratio.

AB About 15 million hectares of peat soils have been drained for forestry in temperate and boreal zones. Increasing interest in wood biomass as a source of bioenergy has led to more intensive harvests also in peatland forests. These harvestings remove branches, needles, and stump/root systems that would earlier have remained onsite. However, in drained peatland forests, some key growth-limiting nutrients, such as potassium (K) and boron (B), are largely stored in the living tree biomass, while the stores in peat in tree rooting layer are small. A concern has thus been raised that bioenergy harvesting may induce nutrient insufficiency and decrease second rotation forest productivity. We studied the effect of whole-tree and stump harvesting on site nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), K, and B capitals in final harvesting of a well-productive, Norway spruce-dominated peatland forest. Harvesting of stumps and above-ground harvest residues resulted in minor depletion of site N and P stores, but significant depletion of K and B. Maximizing harvest residue biomass recovery, but minimizing nutrient depletion, our results indicated that stump harvesting is a more feasible option than harvesting of above-ground residues. If above-ground harvest residues are to be harvested for bioenergy, K and B depletion may be decreased by letting the branches dry out somewhat and the needles fall down before branch harvesting. Combining our results with data on waterborne K losses suggested that K depletion may become a serious problem in second rotation forests on drained peatlands, even if harvest residues and stumps were left completely non-harvested.

AB The soil atmosphere in forested peat soils with depths of 0.8-1.2 m was monitored regularly for 3 years. Samples from gas equilibration chambers were analysed for N2, O2, CO2, CH4, N2O and Ne by gas chromatography.
   Short spring periods with simultaneous and rapid O2 decrease/CO2 increase were the characteristics features at a soil depth of 5 cm. They were the effects of perched water tables on frozen soil layers. The soil atmosphere composition at a depth of 20 cm was particularly variable in the poorly drained sites, where this soil depth was close to the alternating level of the groundwater. At a depth of 50 cm, CO2 and CH4 had minimum concentrations in early or mid-summer and maximum concentrations in the late autumn or early winter. The reverse pattern for O2 was indicated, but was less clear.
   In individual profiles and on average, O2 decreased and CO2 increased with increasing depth, except during some transient periods in the spring.
   Medium (H6) humified, inadequately drained Sphagnum peat differed from well humified (H8), well-drained wood peat, in that it contained considerable concentrations of CH4. Only very small concentrations were occasionally found in the humified wood peat and they did not increase when the groundwater level rose after clearfelling.
   The groundwater level rose after clearfelling on both types of peat. Concentrations of O2 decreased and CO2 increased in the topsoil, particularly in the medium humified and insufficiently drained Sphagnum peat.
   The soil atmospheres, as represented by mean concentrations and extreme concentrations at three depths during the growing season, were significantly different on all plots, including the parallel clearfelled and forested plots.

   FOR BOG RESTORATION
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
LA English
DT Article
DE BOGS; RELICTS; WATER BALANCE; RESTORATION
AB The hydrology of bog relicts differs from that in undisturbed bogs. The surface layers of these relicts mostly consist of moderately to strongly humified, secondary weathered peat as a result of drainage and peat cutting. The hydrophysical properties of these layers cause relatively high groundwater level fluctuations.
   Deep drainage systems, both in the bog relicts and in their surroundings, may have increased the downward seepage. Reduction of these downward water losses may be crucial for the restoration of the required hydrological conditions in certain bog relicts (hydrological bufferzone as external water management option). The potential of internal hydrological modifications, where the increase in storage capacity near the surface is essential, should be emphasized in many bog relicts. Considerable reductions in water level fluctuations can be achieved e.g. when the open water within the area is enlarged and when this water is equally distributed over the area with small peat ridges in between. In general, attention should be given to both the internal and external options in studies on water man agement.

The plant communities were analysed in relation to the following environmental variables: the tree stand characteristics, hydrology and nutrient contents of the Peat. Canonical correspondence, analysis was used to relate the environmental variables to the plant community data. The species-environment relationships are also shown by means of scatter Plots. Because of the problem of multicollinearity, the effects of the individual environmental factors could not be studied in detail. It is evident, however, that the post-drainage vegetation succession has been most rapid in the mom fertile site types, due to the tree stand development and the higher nutrient levels. In fact, sites drained at about the same time, represent different stages of succession. The results show, however, that the post-drainage plant communities can be used in site classification.  The distinction between the site classes is better in the nutrient-rich part of the tropic series.

AB 1. Drainage of peat-dominated catchments across the world has caused widespread degradation of peat and freshwater ecosystem services. In the UK, an estimated 500 pound million has been spent over the last decade blocking drains to reverse these changes. The practice raises water-tables to induce rewetting and promote peat aggradation. However, the potential benefits for impacted ecosystems such as streams remain unknown.
   2. This study examined stream physicochemistry and benthic macroinvertebrates across peatland catchments with artificial drainage networks, or drains that have recently been blocked, and compared these with intact peatland sites having no history of drainage.
   3. Streams in artificially drained catchments were characterised by more benthic fine particulate organic matter (FPOM), higher suspended sediment concentrations and finer bed sediments (D50) than in drain-blocked and intact catchments.
   4. Drained sites had higher abundance of Diptera (Simuliidae and Chironomidae) larvae, and lower abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera larvae, than drain-blocked sites. In contrast, streams in drain-blocked catchments had macroinvertebrate communities broadly similar to intact sites in terms of taxon richness, overall species composition and community structure. These changes were associated with lower suspended sediment and benthic FPOM concentrations following drain-blocking.
   5. Synthesis and applications. This study has shown changes in the structure of stream benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages linked to increases in benthic particulate organic matter and suspended sediment following peatland drainage. However, these effects seem to be reversible following catchment- scale restoration by drain-blocking. Drain-blocking therefore appears to benefit not only peatland soil, vegetation and hydrological ecosystem services but also stream water quality and biodiversity. The numerous agencies undertaking peatland restoration should consider implementing detailed pre-and post-blocking monitoring of streams to further improve our understanding of the mechanisms through which peatland management affects stream biodiversity and biological recovery dynamics, refine drain-blocking practices, and inform aquatic conservation and management strategies.

AB Water discolouration is a major management problem for UK water companies as a proportion of the supply relies on runoff from peat-covered catchments. Many peats have been drained using surface ditches but this has been shown to lead to more severe water discolouration. Drain-blocking is now actively encouraged in UK peatlands to promote peatland habitats and water companies are considering funding drain-btocking if water colour benefits can be demonstrated. However, there is concern that rewetting of the peat may lead to a sudden flush of water colour from the peat causing problems for water treatment works downstream. This study tested different drain-blocking techniques in an upland peat catchment and evaluated the impact of drain-blocking on water colour production immediately after drain-blocking. The study started sampling prior to the blocking of the drains and continued for 10 months afterwards. It was shown that drain-blocking significantly increased water tables in the vicinity of the drains. Drain-blocking approximately doubled water colour within blocked drains, a difference that was sustained across the entire study period. Whenever runoff occurred from a blocked drain it was always more discoloured than prior to blocking. However, during the 10 months following drain-blocking no catchment scale change in river water colour could be determined. No drain-blocking technique was demonstrably better or worse than any other with respect to water colour and percentage of time for which there was flow in the drain. Therefore, if more drain-btocking is undertaken then the most economical methods, using peat turves, should be adopted. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The availability of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) commonly limits tree growth on drained peatlands. The nutritional status and volume growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) after varying doses of wood ash fertilization were investigated in seven field experiments located on deep-peated sites in Finland between latitudes 63 degrees N and 67 degrees N. Needle samples were taken 14-20 years after fertilization and trees measured 15 years after fertilization. Annual growth rates and differences in foliar nutrients were analyzed with a two-way ANOVA model. A regression model was used in the analysis of periodic relative volume growth. High doses of wood ash (100-265 kg P(.)ha(-1), 225-450 kg K(.)ha(-1)) resulted in greater changes in foliar nutrient concentrations and in a stronger growth response than low doses (5-50 kg P(.)ha(-1), 14-210 kg K(.)ha(-1)). Significant increases in needle mass and concentrations of P, K, and B were observed in the ash-fertilized stands, with a good status for these elements 20 years after fertilization. Depending on the ash dose, the mean annual volume growth was 0.5-1.4 m(3.)ha(-1) higher than in the control plots during the 15 year postfertilization period.

AB The chemical composition of peat cores sampled from nine drained peatland catchments overlying either black schist or felsic bedrock was studied in Finland. Black schist is enriched in heavy metals, sulphur and graphitic carbon, and therefore it is susceptible to weathering whereas felsic rock types in the study region are more resistant and contain only negligible amounts of heavy metals, sulphur and carbon. A total of nineteen cores down to the underlying regolith were taken and electrical conductivity was measured in the field. The peat cores were divided into 160 peat samples for the determination of chemical composition and acidity. As a result of weathering, diffusion into the ground water and adsorption by the peat, concentrations of As, Co, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Zn, and S, as well as electrical conductivity were expected to be greater in the peat overlying black schist than in peat overlying felsic rocks and this difference was assumed to be strong in the bottom layers and to weaken near the surface. The basal Carex (sedge) peat layer showed elevated concentrations of elements compared to the upper Sphagnum (moss) peat layers. The effect of peatland margins and flooding also exerts some influence on higher Cu, S and Fe concentrations. Ambient environmental features and conditions, such as slope and aspect affected peat chemistry in two catchments in particular. The first catchment showed high heavy metal and trace element contents associated with peat accumulation on sloping terrain, as ground water discharges at a spring on a rather steeply sloping surface. Another catchment with lower heavy metal and trace element contents represents peat accumulation in a well-leached watershed characterized by sandy deposits within a flat valley floor and an acidity that induced the development of a Sphagnum bog phase during the early stages of mire formation. In addition to the chemical concentration of underlying bedrock and soil, the factors affecting element concentrations in peat were the topography of the environment including paludification mode and species composition and the subsiding relations of the peatland and drainage. Special caution should be paid when excavation is carried out on sites containing high sulphide concentrations in bedrock, overburden or peat, e.g. ditch network maintenance or peat harvest can lead to enhanced leaching of acidity and heavy metals. Anthropogenic activities on sulphide rich peatlands pose an environmental risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Question: We studied vegetation succession after drainage in a bog, as an analogue for potential persistent water table drawdown due to climate change. We asked: (1) how does bog vegetation change following a long-term water table lowering and (2) how are effects of drainage on hydrology and vegetation distributed temporally and spatially?
   Location: Mer Bleue peatland, Ontario, Canada (45.41 degrees N, 75.48 degrees W).
   Methods: Analyses of changes in vegetation and hydrology associated with drainage were examined spatially along a hydrosequence and temporally using paleoecological reconstructions from peat cores (testate amoebae, pollen) in a drained portion of a peatland untouched for 85 years following drainage. Relationships between modern vegetation and water table were assessed through clustering and ordination analyses of vegetation releves.
   Results: Post-drainage increases in tree cover, especially Betula and Larix, decreases in Sphagnum cover and shifts in species composition of dominant shrubs were observed. Present-day vegetation patterns along the hydrosequence were primarily related to seasonal variability of water table depth. Paleoecological records reveal that where the present-day vegetation has been impacted by drainage, persistent water table lowering occurred in response to drainage. However, in an area with relatively natural vegetation, a transient drop in water table depth occurred at the time of drainage.
   Conclusions: Temporal and spatial patterns revealed that the bog response to drainage was spatially and temporally heterogeneous, and probably mediated by feedbacks among vegetation, peat structure and hydrology. Spatial patterns along the hydrosequence were similar to those observed in paleoecological reconstructions, but the use of the two complementary techniques provides additional insights.

AB Drainage and urea fertilization of forested peatlands in western Canada are being contemplated as means for increasing peatland conifer productivity. Surface application of urea-based fertilizers may result in loss of some N by volatilization of NH3. The objective of the present study was to assess the loss of NH3 from undrained and drained peatland sites as affected by various N dosages, i.e. 0 (unfertilized), 200 (N-2) and 400 kg N ha(-1) (N-4), following field broadcast application of urea fertilizer. Losses of NH3 from fertilized plots were higher on the undrained relative to the drained site. Increase in urea-N dosage increased NH3 volatilization from both sites. Most of the NH3 volatilization losses occurred during the first 9 days after fertilizer application. The precipitation that occurred on day 9 after fertilizer application decreased NH3 volatilization to background levels of unfertilized plots for the rest of the study period. Net mean losses of NH3 from the undrained site were 3% and 4% of applied N for N-2 and N-4, respectively. Corresponding losses on the drained site were 0.7% and 7%. These magnitudes of loss of N appear to be less important from a forest management point of view.

AB The importance of the seed bank as a regenerative strategy in disturbed mires and the viability of seeds and spores in peat stratigraphy on two drained mires were studied prior to restoration. Most of the seedlings developed from the surface sample but still viable seeds occurred in the deepest layer sampled (50 cm). Germination from seeds, however, remained low. Six species of vascular plants: Betula pubescens Ehrh., Eriophorum vaginatum L., Rubus chamaemorus L., Vaccinium myrtillus L., V. uliginosum L., and Andromeda polifolia L. with a maximum of 367 seedlings per m(2) germinated. The regenerative strategy of these plants seems to be vegetative expansion from adventitious roots and buried propagules rather than germination from seeds. It was found, however, that some seeds in the peat profile may preserve their viability for centuries.

AB Wildfires are natural phenomena which regulate functioning and stability of fire-adapted ecosystems. However, their occurrence may impair the functioning of fire-susceptible ecosystems by disturbing nutrient cycling and biodiversity. This work aimed to identify environmental factors shaping post-fire patterns of shrub expansion in a drained, burned peatland. This research was conducted in a fire-susceptible drained rich fen, located in Biebrza National Park (Poland), which was subjected to a large-scale smouldering fire in 2002. In 2014, water and soil chemistry were studied alongside with foliar nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium(K) contents of a native shrub (Salix cinerea) in four vegetation types present after the fire. Unburned areas were dominated by herbaceous plants. Willows present were sparse and low, with chloroses and necroses. Their foliar nutrient content indicated strong K limitation. Moderately burned areas were dominated either by willows or nitrophilous plants. Willows in moderately burned areas had high chlorophyll content in leaves and their foliar nutrient content indicated a lack of evident nutrient limitation. In the moderately burned areas, relatively high contents of phosphates (P-PO43-) were recorded in soil and water. In areas with high fire severity, willows were withdrawing and their foliar nutrient content indicated N limitation. Decreased content of P-PO43- and ammonium (N-NH4+) in soil and water was also observed there. Thus, fire-induced changes in fen geochemistry were recorded twelve years after a disturbance which shaped the long-term dynamics of shrub expansion. The fire ceased K limitation in burned areas and increased P availability. Strong K limitation, which is typical in degraded fens, appeared to be critical for keeping unmanaged fen meadows with low shrub cover. The occurrence of strong K limitation in drained fen ecosystems may reduce the need for investment in conservation practices used to restrict shrub expansion (e.g. regular mowing or shrub removal).

AB Reclamation of peat bogs for agriculture changes the physical and chemical characteristics of the peat matrix, for example, drainage and tillage accelerate decomposition, altering peat porosity, pore size distribution, and hydraulic properties. This study investigated changes in near-saturated hydraulic conductivity over time after drainage of peat soil for agricultural use by conducting tension infiltrometer measurements in a mire that has been gradually drained and reclaimed for agriculture during the past 80 years (with fields drained 2, 12, 40, and 80 years before the measurements). At pore water pressure closest to saturation (pressure head -1 cm), hydraulic conductivity in the newest field was approximately nine times larger than that in the oldest field, and a decreasing trend with field age was observed. A similar (but weaker) trend was observed with -3 cm pressure head (approximately four times larger in the newest field in comparison to the oldest), but at -6 cm head, there were no significant differences. These results indicate that peat degradation reduces the amount of millimetre-sized pores in particular. They also indicate that changes in peat macroporosity continue for several decades before a new steady state is reached.

AB We addressed how restoration of forestry-drained peatlands affects CH4-cycling microbes. Despite similar community compositions, the abundance of methanogens and methanotrophs was lower in restored than in natural sites and correlated with CH4 emission. Poor establishment of methanogens may thus explain low CH4 emissions on restored peatlands even 10 to 12 years after restoration.

AB The greenhouse-gas (GHG) balance of CH4 and N2O emissions and CO2 respiration in peatlands plays a key role in climate change. A GHG balance is mostly calculated from point measurements. In this study we propose and test a geophysical method of low frequency domain electromagnetic method (FDEM) as a proxy for forest-floor CO2 respiration and CH4 emissions in two 50 x 100 m drained peatlands in Estonia: a Downy birch and a Scots pine stand from April to September 2015. The FDEM measurement campaign in September 2015 yielded a detailed map of topsoil electrical conductivity. We explain the predictive power of FDEM on GHG emissions through relationships with dry bulk density of soil. Although we over- or underestimated some fluxes owing to soil heterogeneity, we composed reasonably credible GHG emission maps. The initial results seem promising and we recommend further application of FDEM methods. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CO2 EMISSIONS; UK; POWER
AB Onshore wind energy is a key component of the renewable energies used by governments to reduce carbon emissions from electricity production, but will carbon emissions be reduced when wind farms are located on carbon-rich peatands? Wind farms are often located in uplands because most are of low agricultural value, are distant from residential areas, and are windy. Many UK uplands are peatlands, with layers of accumulated peat that represent a large stock of soil carbon. When peatlands are drained for construction there is a higher risk of net carbon loss than for mineral soils. Previous work suggests that wind farms sited on peatlands can reduce net carbon emissions if strictly managed for maximum retention of carbon. Here we show that, whereas in 2010, most sites had potential to provide net carbon savings, by 2040 most sites will not reduce carbon emissions even with careful management. This is due to projected changes in the proportion of fossil fuels used to generate electricity. The results suggest future policy should avoid constructing wind farms on undegraded peatlands unless drainage of peat is minimal and the volume excavated in foundations can be significantly reduced compared to energy output.

AB Microbes play crucial roles in global carbon cycles, particularly in peatland ecosystems that store vast quantities of carbon. Boreal peatlands are under stress from commercial extraction of peat, drainage for conversion to forestry and agricultural lands, and climate change. In this study, we identify key microbial groups and their ecological functions across peatland depth profiles and provide insight into how environmental changes related to water table may alter microbial communities. We examined the diversity and composition of prokaryotic communities across a microtopographic hummock-hollow gradient using Illumina sequencing. Communities formed a gradient of species and functional groups with depth, with overlap in functional groups at lower layers of hummocks and upper layers of hollows. Yet, overall, we found significantly different prokaryotic communities in hollows than hummocks. Surfaces of hummocks were typified by aerobic chemoorganotrophs, methanotrophs and chemoheterotrophs, mid-depths were typified by aerobic chemoorganotrophs, nitrogen-fixing bacteria and anaerobic nitrate reducers, while lower depths in hollows were typified by anaerobic and facultative anaerobic chemoorganotrophs, nitrate reducers and methanogenic archaea. Microbial composition as a function of hydrology and moisture regimes suggests that environmental changes that alter hydrological regimes (e.g., climate change, peatland draining) may alter carbon and nutrient cycling regimes.

AB Water table position, through the creation of aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the soil profile, plays an important role in controlling CH4 flux from wetlands. A laboratory study of peat columns revealed that CH4 emission rates initially increased and then decreased as the water table was lowered from the peat surface to a depth of 50 cm, with the release of CH4 trapped in pores.  There was a strong hysteresis between CH4 flux on the falling and rising water table limbs (falling > rising). When expressed as seasonal average values, there was a strong relationship (r2 0.08 - 0.74) between log CH4 flux and water table position for sites within 5 wetland regions in boreal-subarctic Canada. The regression coefficients were similar among regions (0.022 - 0.037), but there were differences in the regression constants (0.47 - 1.89). CH4 flux from drained, forested peatland soils decreased as the water table depth increased, and several sites were transformed from sources to sinks of CH4. Global CH4 emissions to the atmosphere may have been reduced by almost-equal-to 1 Tg yr-1 by peatland drainage during the last 100 yr.

AB Total Organic Carbon (TOC) concentrations in stream waters from peat-covered catchments have increased over the last 15-25 years, resulting in large-scale brownification of lakes and rivers in high latitudes. While this increase has primarily been attributed to decreased acid deposition and climatic warming in most regions, we studied whether peatland drainage in forested catchments has contributed to the increasing TOC concentrations. We analysed the spatial variability of average TOC concentrations from a total of 133 peatland dominated catchments in Sweden and Finland, of which 62 were pristine and 71 were drained during the last century. In addition, we performed a trend analysis on 37 catchments for which long-term data were available. We found about 14 mg l(-1) higher TOC concentrations in streams discharging from drained than undrained sites in southern latitudes, and about 8 mg l(-1) higher concentrations from drained sites in northern latitudes. Trend analysis did not indicate significant differences in TOC concentration trends between drained and undrained catchments but indicated that tree stand volume correlated with increasing trends. This supports earlier findings in that the general increase in forest cover and biomass that has occurred in high latitudes during the last decades is another factor that has contributed to brownification.

AB The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California was drained and converted to agriculture more than a century ago, and since then has experienced extreme rates of soil subsidence from peat oxidation. To reverse subsidence and capture carbon there is increasing interest in converting drained agricultural land-use types to flooded conditions. Rice agriculture is proposed as a flooded land-use type with CO2 sequestration potential for this region. We conducted two years of simultaneous eddy covariance measurements at a conventional drained and grazed degraded peatland and a newly converted rice paddy to evaluate the impact of drained to flooded land-use change on CO2, CH4, and evaporation fluxes. We found that the grazed degraded peatland emitted 175-299 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) as CO2 and 3.3 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) as CH4, while the rice paddy sequestered 84-283 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) of CO2 from the atmosphere and released 2.5-6.6 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) as CH4. The rice paddy evaporated 45-95% more water than the grazed degraded peatland. Annual photosynthesis was similar between sites, but flooding at the rice paddy inhibited ecosystem respiration, making it a net CO2 sink. The rice paddy had reduced rates of soil subsidence due to oxidation compared with the drained peatland, but did not completely reverse subsidence. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the effects of ditch blocking on fluvial carbon concentrations and fluxes at a 5-year, replicated, control-intervention field experiment on a blanket peatland in North Wales, UK. The site was hydrologically instrumented, and run-off via open and blocked ditches was analysed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon, dissolved carbon dioxide, and dissolved methane. DOC was also analysed in peat porewater and overland flow. The hillslope experiment was embedded within a paired control-intervention catchment study, with 3years of preblocking and 6years of postblocking data. Results from the hillslope showed large reductions in discharge via blocked ditches, with water partly redirected into hillslope surface and subsurface flows, and partly into remaining open ditches. We observed no impacts of ditch blocking on DOC, particulate organic carbon, dissolved carbon dioxide or methane in ditch waters, DOC in porewaters or overland flow, or stream water DOC at the paired catchment scale. Similar DOC concentrations in ditch water, overland flow, and porewater suggest that diverting flow from the ditch network to surface or subsurface flow had a limited impact on concentrations or fluxes of DOC entering the stream network. The subdued response of fluvial carbon to ditch blocking in our study may be attributable to the relatively low susceptibility of blanket peatlands to drainage, or to physical alterations of the peat since drainage. We conclude that ditch blocking cannot be always be expected to deliver reductions in fluvial carbon loss, or improvements in the quality of drinking water supplies.

AB The microbial activity and bacterial community structure were investigated in two types of peat soil in a temperate marsh. The first, a drained grassland fen soil, has a neutral pH with partially degraded peat in the upper oxic soil horizons (16% soil organic carbon). The second, a bog soil, was sampled in a swampy forest and has a very high soil organic carbon content (45%), a low pH (45), and has occasional anoxic conditions in the upper soil horizons due to the high water table level. The microbial activity in the two soils was measured as the basal and substrate-induced respiration (SIR). Unexpectedly, the SIR (mu l CO2 g(-1) dry soil) was higher in the bog than in the fen soil, but lower when CO2 production was expressed per volume of soil. This may be explained by the notable difference in the bulk densities of the two soils. The bacterial communities were assessed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiling of 16S rRNA genes and indicated differences between the two soils. The differences were determined by the soil characteristics rather than the season in which the soil was sampled. The 16S rRNA gene libraries, constructed from the two soils, revealed high proportions of sequences assigned to the Acidobacteria phylum. Each library contained a distinct set of phylogenetic subgroups of this important group of bacteria. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to examine plant community development and peat stratigraphy in the context of ground-water flow systems for five forested peatlands in central New York State for which extensive vegetation, surface hydrology, and water chemistry analyses has been performed. Peatland development trends, from the initial period of peat accumulation to the present, were explored using pear stratigraphy, analysis of ground-water flow systems and evidence fi om existing vegetation. Detailed analyses, including the construction of numerical ground-water models were performed for one of the five sites to examine the process of bog development within what was once a highly calcareous fen and to examine the impacts of agricultural drainage on peatland ground-water flow. Feat stratigraphy analysis indicated two pathways of peatland development: infilling of shallow lakes and peat accumulation on ground-water seeps. Lake-infill peatlands were characterized by a sequence of Limnic peat--> bryophyte-sedge peat-->hemic-fibric sedge peat-->sapric wood peat (or Sphagnum peat). Analysis of ground-water flow systems indicated that four of the peatlands were characterized by mineral-rich ground-water discharge along peatland margins, with lateral flow through the peatlands towards drainage features. The fifth peatland was characterized by a more complex ground-water flow system with a weakly minerotrophic water-table mound driving shallow ground-water recharge flow. The water-table mound has been reduced in extent by agricultural drainage and demonstrates seasonal fluctuations in hydraulic head and areal extent.

AB A multi-model-based study was performed in order to unravel valuable fen meadow habitats' possible exposure to eutrophication, which is expected to occur as a result of the re-saturation of degraded peat soils. The framework was tested in a 3000-ha fen-drain system to be restored in the Middle Biebrza Basin (northeast Poland), where the datasets and related models were used to delineate prospective eutrophication hotspots and nutrient transport. A 1-d hydrodynamic model and a 3-d groundwater flow model were applied to constitute the hydrological response of the fen-drain system to the prospective construction and function of weirs and spillways, which are expected to induce the increase of groundwater levels in degraded fens. A groundwater particle-tracking postprocessor was applied to delineate flow pathways and discharge zones and to determine water residence time in modelled layers. Soil and habitat maps, a high-resolution digital elevation model and historic groundwater level observations were applied to the model performance, calibration and spatial analysis of prospective eutrophication hotspots where increased eutrophication of groundwater can be expected due to the re-saturation of degraded peat soils. The study revealed that the large-scale fen rewetting that occurred as a result of surface water bodies' damming can potentially result in groundwater-driven nutrient dispersion along with an enhanced nutrient transport from a fen to the adjacent water bodies. Spatial analyses showed that, although the rewetting-driven eutrophication of Molinia fen meadows located in the study area is not likely, one can expect increased nutrient discharges to adjacent drains, inducing the contamination of ox-bow lakes located along the rivers. We propose the presented methodology to be applied ex-ante to fen-rewetting projects in strategic environmental assessments of restoration projects in order to manage the potentially negative environmental consequences of fen and river eutrophication with special regard to nutrient hotspots that are likely to occur within the rewetted fens.

AB Peatland water table depth is an important control on runoff production, plant growth and carbon cycling. Many peatlands have been drained but are now subject to activities that might lead to their restoration including the damming of artificial drains. This paper investigates water table dynamics on intact, drained and restored peatland slopes in a blanket peat in northern England using transects of automated water table recorders. Long-term (18 month), seasonal and short-term (storm event) records are explored. The restored site had drains blocked 6 years prior to monitoring commencing. The spatially-weighted mean water table depths over an 18 month period were -5.8 cm, -8.9 cm and -11.5 cm at the intact, restored and drained sites respectively. Most components of water table behaviour at the restored site, including depth exceedance probability curves, seasonality of water table variability, and water table responses to individual rainfall events were intermediate between that of the drained and intact sites. Responses also depended on location with respect to the drains. The results show that restoration of drained blanket peat is difficult and the water table dynamics may not function in the same way as those in undisturbed blanket peat even many years after management intervention. Further measurement of hydrological processes and water table responses to peatland restoration are required to inform land managers of the hydrological success of those projects.

TI Retention of Sediment and Nutrient Loads with Peak Runoff Control
SO JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID WATER-QUALITY; GENERATION; DRAINAGE
AB The purpose of this research was to evaluate peak runoff control as a water protection method to reduce sediment and nutrient loads. Increased eutrophication of surface waters and risk of floods demands cost effective methods to reduce pollutant input and risks of flooding. With the peak runoff control it is possible to cut the main peaks and store the runoff water temporarily in ditches. The method decreases the suspended solids (SS) and nutrient loads by reducing flow velocities, and improving the settling of sediment particles. The method was tested in two heavily drained adjacent peat harvesting areas suffering considerable erosion. The peak flows were cut by 27-87%, the SS load by 61-94%, the total nitrogen (N-tot) by 45-91%, and the total phosphorus (P-tot) load by 47-88%. The peak runoff control method operated most effectively during extreme events when most of the SS load is transported. A detailed particle analysis of runoff water showed that water detention reduced the median particle size of SS load as the largest particles settle. The results clearly indicate that the peak runoff control is an effective method to control the sediment loads and peak flows from peatland drainage.

AB Restoration impact of forestry-drained peatlands on runoff water quality and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient export was studied. Eight catchments were included: three mesotrophic (one undrained control, two treatments), two ombrotrophic (one drained control, one treatment) and three oligotrophic catchments (one undrained control, two treatments). Three calibration years and four post-restoration years were included in the data from seven catchments, for which runoff was recorded. For one mesotrophic treatment catchment only one year of pre-restoration and two years of post-restoration water quality data is reported. Restoration was done by filling in and damming the ditches. Water samples were collected monthly-biweekly during the snow-free period; runoff was recorded continuously during the same period. Water quality was estimated for winter using ratios derived from external data. Runoff for non-recorded periods were estimated using the FEMMA model.
   A high impact on DOC, nitrogen (N) and phosporus (P) was observed in the mesotrophic catchments, and mostly no significant impact in the nutrient-poor catchments. The DOC load from one catchment exceeded 1000 kg (restored-ha)(-1) in the first year; increase of DOC concentration from 50 to 250 mg l(-1) was observed in the other mesotrophic treatment catchment. Impact on total nitrogen export of over 30 kg (restored-ha)(-1) was observed in one fertile catchment during the first year. An impact of over 5 kg (restored-ha()-1) on ammonium export was observed in one year in the mesotrophic catchment. Impact on P export from the mesotrophic catchment was nearly 5 kg P (restored-ha)(-1) in the first year.
   The results imply that restoration of nutrient-rich forestry-drained peatlands poses significant risk for at least short term elevated loads degrading the water quality in receiving water bodies. Restoration of nutrient-poor peatlands poses a minor risk in comparison. Research is needed regarding the factors behind these risks and how to mitigate them. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Heterotrophic soil respiration (CO 2 efflux from the decomposition of peat and root litter) in three forestry-drained peatlands with different site types and with a large climatic gradient from the hemi-boreal (central Estonia) to south (southern Finland) and north boreal (northern Finland) conditions was studied. Instantaneous fluxes varied between 0 and 1.3 g CO2-C m(-2) h(-1), and annual fluxes between 248 and 515 g CO2-C m(-2) a(-1). Variation in the annual fluxes among site types was studied only in the south-boreal site where we found a clear increase from nutrient-poor to nutrient-rich site types. More than half of the within-site variation was temporal and explained by soil surface (-5 cm) temperature (T5). The response of soil respiration to T5 varied between the sites; the most northerly site had the highest response to T5 and the most southerly the lowest. This trend further resulted in increased annual fluxes towards north. This unexpected result is hypothesised to be related to differences in site factors like substrate quality, nutrient status and hydrology but also to temperature acclimation, i.e., adaptation of decomposer populations to different climates.

AB One fourth of the forests in Finland are growing on drained peatlands. Forestry operations such as ditch network maintenance increase the export of suspended solids and nutrients, and deteriorate water quality in lakes and rivers. Water protection presupposes an understanding of how forestry operations affect peatland hydrology. The objective was to study the hydrological impacts of ditch cleaning on the basis of water table level and runoff measurements from two pairs of artificially delineated catchments in drained peatland forests in Finland. Data from treated and control catchments indicated that ditch cleaning lowered the level of the water table in sites where a shallow peat layer was underlain by mineral soil. In sites with deep peat formation, the water table showed no detectable response to ditch cleaning. Runoff data suggested that annual runoff clearly increased after ditch cleaning, which was in conflict with the previously reported small impacts of ditch network maintenance. The hydrological model FEMMA was calibrated and applied to assess the conformity of the data and the experimental setup. In the model application, the catchments were assumed to behave as independent hydrological units. However, assessment of the model results and the measurements suggested that ditch cleaning had an impact on hydrological measurements in both treated and control catchments. It appeared that the independence assumption was violated and there was a hydrological connection between the artificial catchments and, therefore, the results of the data analysis were considered misleading. Finally, a numerical experiment based on the model simulations was conducted to explain how the assumed relationship between soil moisture and transpiration is reflected in the modelled runoff. Modelled runoff decreases and evaporation increases when ditches are cleaned in poorly drained sites, where the initial ditch depth is small and the depth of a highly conductive topsoil layer is low. The numerical experiment can be applied to assess when ditch cleaning does not improve evapotranspiration and is unnecessary.

AB Northern European peatlands are important habitats for biological conservation because they support rich biodiversity and unique species compositions. However, historical management of peatland habitats has had negative consequences for biodiversity and their degradation remains a major conservation concern. Despite increasing awareness of the conservation value of peatlands, the statuses and ecological requirements of peat land species have remained largely understudied. Here, we first analysed temporal trends of Northern European peatland birds to document the status of their populations using bird data from five different countries. Second, we used Finnish monitoring data to assess habitat preferences of peatland bird species, hence helping to target conservation to the most relevant habitat types. There was a general decline of 40% in Northern European peatland bird population sizes in 1981-2014 (speed of decline 1.5%/year) largely driven by Finland, where populations declined almost 50% (2.0% annual decline). In Sweden and Norway, peatland bird populations declined by 20% during 1997-2014 (1.0% annual decline). In contrast, southern populations in Estonia and Latvia, where the majority of open peatlands are protected, showed a 40% increase during 1981-2014 (1.0% annual increase). The most important habitat characteristics preferred by common peatland species in Finland were openness and low tree height, while wetness proved to be an important feature for waders. Drainage of peatlands had clear negative effects on the densities of many species, with the only exception of rustic bunting, which specializes on edge habitats. Our findings call for more effective conservation actions in Northern European peatland habitats, especially in Finland where peatland drainage represents a major threat to biodiversity.

AB Streams draining peatland systems contain a number of different C-species, all of which are linked either directly or indirectly to the cycling of C in the terrestrial environment. Concentrations and fluxes of dissolved, particulate and gaseous forms of carbon were measured along a network of streams draining an acidic peatland catchment (46.3 km(2)) in NE Scotland. The main aim was to identify sources and sinks of all the major forms of C in the drainage network and use this to develop a conceptual understanding of the evolution of streamwater chemistry along a peatland stream continuum. The investigation included a small-scale intra-catchment study of three contiguous sites in a 1.3 km(2) headwater catchment (Brocky Burn) and a larger scale integrated study of seven sites. Mean annual fluxes of the main carbon species varied from 115 - 215 (DOC), 8.15 - 97.0 (POC), 0.32 - 6.90 (HCO3- - C) and 2.62 - 10.4 (free CO2-C) kg C ha(-1) year(-1); all contributed to the overall carbon flux to varying degrees. Methane-C was only measurable at sites within areas of deep peat (< 0.01 - 0.09 kg C ha(-1) year(-1)). Downstream spatial changes in the intra-catchment study (Brocky Burn) were characterised by a decrease in DOC, CO2-C and CH4-C and an increase in POC fluxes over a distance of 1.1 km from the Upper to the Lower sites. In the context of the integrated catchment study estimated losses and gains of carbon from the water column showed no net change in DOC, a large decrease in POC ( - 55%) and a slight increase in HCO3-- C (+7.7%) and CO2-C (+4.5%). A significant decrease in the CO2-C flux: HCO3-C flux ratio with distance downstream from the stream source, illustrates the importance of outgassing of CO2 from streams draining peatland C reservoirs. These data are interpreted in the context of losses and gains of the various components of the aquatic C flux along the peatland stream continuum.

AB Habitat loss is one of the greatest threats for biodiversity. In Finland, two thirds of natural mires have been drained for silviculture, which transforms open wetlands into dense forests. However, vegetation management of power line rights-of-way (ROW) maintain the drained mires as open areas. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the power line ROW vegetation management on butterfly abundance, species richness and community structure by comparing the managed power line ROWs to unmanaged drained control sites and to natural mires. The species richness or abundance of mire butterflies did not differ between the power line ROWs and natural mires. In contrast, both species richness and abundance of butterflies was low on the unmanaged control sites. Tree canopy cover had a negative effect on mire butterflies and this is most likely related to changes in microclimate. The results indicate that the active vegetation removal in the power line ROWs maintain alternative habitats for mire butterflies; yet, the power line ROWs cannot substitute the natural mires.

AB The main aim of the current study was to estimate the annual net nitrogen mineralization (NNM) flux in stands of different tree species growing on drained peatlands, as well as to clarify the effect of tree species, soil properties and litter on annual NNM dynamics. Three study sites were set up in May 2014: a downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) stand and a Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stand in Oxalis full-drained swamp (ODS) and a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand in Myrtillus full-drained swamp (MDS). The NNM flux was estimated using the in situ method with incubated polyethylene bags. The highest value of NNM was found in stands that were growing on fertile ODS: 127.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 87.7 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), in the downy birch stand and in the Norway spruce stand, respectively. A significantly lower annual NNM flux (11.8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) occurred in the Scots pine stand growing in MDS. Nitrification was highest at fertile ODS sites and ammonification was the highest at the low fertility MDS site. For all study sites, positive correlation was found between soil temperature and NNM intensity. The difference in annual NNM between the downy birch stand and the Norway spruce stand growing on similar drained fertile peatlands was due to litter quality. The annual N input into the soil through leaf litter was the highest at the downy birch site where also the C/N ratio of litter was the lowest. The second highest N input into the soil was found in the spruce stand and the lowest in the pine stand.

AB Fluxes of CO2 and CH4 were determined by a static chamber technique at eight drained swamp peatland sites, with crop and forest covers. Over a 6-month period (May - October, 1991), CH4 fluxes ranged from -5 to 7 mg CH4 m-2 d-1 and were not correlated with either soil temperature or water table position. Integrated seasonal emissions were -0.40 to 0.04 g CH4 m2 over 147 days; the sites with a forest or grass cover were a small sink of CH4 whereas the sites with horticultural crops showed no significant flux. Laboratory incubations showed that the highest CH4 consumption rates (3 to 9 mug CH4 g-1 d-1) occurred in the least disturbed soils. The results, when compared with CH4 fluxes from nearby swamps which have been unaffected by drainage, suggest that drainage of temperate peatlands has reduced emissions of CH4 to the atmosphere by 0. 6 - 1 x 10(12) g CH4 yr-1. CO2 fluxes ranged f rom 0 to 16 g CO2 m-2 d-1 and were correlated with the seasonal pattern of temperature in the upper part of the soil profile. Integrated seasonal fluxes for the sites in which root respiration was an unimportant contribution were 0.6 - 0.8 kg CO2 m-2 over 181 days. Aerobic laboratory incubations revealed CO2 production rates of 0.2 - 1.4 mg CO2 g-1 d-1, an average of 5 times the rate under anaerobic conditions. Using bulk density and loss-on-ignition data, we found that the seasonal CO2 fluxes translate into surface lowering of the peat of about 2 mm yr-1, whereas the commonly observed lowering in these cultivated peatlands is 20 mm yr-1. These data suggest that processes other than direct oxidation, such as shrinkage and aeolian erosion, are the major contributor to the surface lowering of the peat.

AB At two field sites representing northeastern German minerotrophic fens (Rhin-Havelluch, a shallow peat site; Gumnitz, a partially drained peat site) the influence of different factors (N fertilization, groundwater table, temperature) on N2O and CH4 emissions was investigated. The degraded fens were sources or sinks of the radiatively active trace gases investigated. The gas fluxes measured were much higher than those found in other terrestrical ecosystems such as forests. Lowering the groundwater table increased the release of N2O and the oxidation of CH4. High CH4 emission rates occurred when the groundwater tables and soil temperatures were high (>12 degrees C). N fertilization stimulated the release of N2O only when application rates were very high (480 kg N ha(-1)). A moderate N supply (60 or 120 kg N ha(-1)) hardly increased the release of N2O in spite of high soluble soil NO3- contents.

AB The proper monitoring of soil moisture content is important to understand water-related processes in peatland ecosystems. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a popular method used for soil moisture content measurements, the applicability of which is still challenging in field studies due to requirements regarding the calibration curve which converts the dielectric constant into the soil moisture content. The main objective of this study was to develop a general calibration equation for the TDR method based on simultaneous field measurements of the dielectric constant and gravimetric water content in the surface layers of degraded peatlands. Data were collected during field campaigns conducted temporarily between the years 2006 and 2016 at the drained peatland Kuwasy located in the north-east area of Poland. Based on the data analysis, a two-slopes linear calibration equation was developed as a general broken-line model (GBLM). A site-specific calibration model (SSM-D) for the TDR method was obtained in the form of a two-slopes equation describing the relationship between the soil moisture content and the dielectric constant and introducing the bioindices as covariates relating to plant species biodiversity and the state of the habitats. The root mean squared error for the GBLM and SSM-D models were equal, respectively, at 0.04 and 0.035 cm(3) cm(-3).

AB Drained peatlands in northern Europe comprise more than 10 million ha of forestland and thus constitute a considerable production potential in forestry. Much of this area consists of stands dominated by Scots pine and close to maturity regarding commercial thinning. The trees within these stands typically vary in terms of age, size, and growth rate. The impacts of silvicultural cuttings on these uneven-structured stands are inadequately known. We simulated the impacts of a control regime with no thinnings, and three different thinning regimes, involving different thinning intensities, on the development of fifteen pine-dominated stands in Finland. The simulations started from the first thinnings and were continued until regeneration maturity. The predicted total yields ranged from 244 to 595 m(3)ha(-1), depending on site and thinning regime. The highest total yields were observed for the control regime in which 18-38% of the yield was, however, predicted to self-thin by the end of the simulation. Thus, the differences in the yields of merchantable wood were fairly small among the compared regimes. However, the regimes involving thinnings generally needed less time than the control regime to reach regeneration maturity. The mean annual increment of total stem volume was at its highest in the control regime. The highest mean annual increment of merchantable wood was obtained in the regime involving two moderate thinnings, but excluding the most low-productive sites where thinnings did not increase the yield of merchantable wood.

AB Peatlands are very problematic from the bearing capacity point of view. Therefore, logging activities on peatlands in Finland are mainly carried out during the coldest weeks in winter time. More intensive utilisation of peatland forests requires logging activities to be increasingly carried out during unfrozen conditions. Multiple passages of a harvester and a loaded forwarder used for the transportation of timber cause deep ruts on the forest floor. Wider logging trails have been presented as an interesting approach to increasing the number of forwarder passages along a single logging trail. It might be advantageous not to follow the same ruts on each pass but to choose a new parallel route, so that new ruts are formed alongside the previous ones. The study aimed at investigating whether it is beneficial to use wide trails in reducing rutting in forests growing on drained peatland. Field studies were conducted on a drained peatland in Alkkia experimental forest, located in Karvia in Western Finland. In the driving test, a forwarder was driven in the same forest site on logging trails with widths of 4.5 m, 6 m and 10 m. The results indicate that wider logging trails provide the forwarder driver with opportunities to reduce rutting in peatland forests.

AB We developed and applied a computational model for simulating unsteady flow in a drainage network of a boreal forested peatland site. The input to the model was the hourly runoff produced by a hydrological model. The simulations of the flow in the ditch network were performed using an iterative procedure for solving the Saint-Venant equations that govern the flow in each of the network channels. These equations were solved separately for each ditch branch, and the flow depths at the junctions were corrected using the method of characteristics. The model was applied to the drainage network of a peatland catchment in Eastern Finland over a period of 15 months. Because flow resistance in the ditches depended strongly on flow conditions, flow resistance (Manning's n) was introduced as a function of discharge. The model was calibrated and validated against field data and the simulation results were further applied to assess erosion risk. The highest risk of erosion occurred during long lasting flows induced by snowmelt at ditch sections with a steep slope and a large upstream area. These model results can aid in the design and siting of water protection measures within the drained area.

AB Peatlands are effective carbon sinks as more biomass is produced than decomposed under the prevalent anoxic conditions. Draining peatlands coupled with warming releases stored carbon, and subsequent rewetting may or may not restore the original carbon sink. Yet, patterns of plant production and decomposition in rewetted peatlands and how they compare to drained conditions remain largely unexplored. Here, we measured annual above- and belowground biomass production and decomposition in three different drained and rewetted peatland types: alder forest, percolation fen and coastal fen during an exceptionally dry year. We also used standard plant material to compare decomposition between the sites, regardless of the decomposability of the local plant material. Rewetted sites showed higher root and shoot production in the percolation fen and higher root production in the coastal fen, but similar root and leaf production in the alder forest. Decomposition rates were generally similar in drained and rewetted sites, only in the percolation fen and alder forest did aboveground litter decompose faster in the drained sites. The rewetted percolation fen and the two coastal sites had the highest projected potential for organic matter accumulation. Roots accounted for 23-66% of total biomass production, and belowground biomass, rather than aboveground biomass, was particularly important for organic matter accumulation in the coastal fens. This highlights the significance of roots as main peat-forming element in these graminoid-dominated fen peatlands and their crucial role in carbon cycling, and shows that high biomass production supported the peatlands' function as carbon sink even during a dry year.

AB Peatland drainage and peat extraction result in runoff water rich in humus, sediments, and nutrients that requires simple purification methods to prevent pollution of surface waters. Chemical treatment of drainage water has been suggested as best management practice. However, good chemical purification results require flocculators to achieve efficient particle aggregation. This study evaluated gravity-driven hydraulic flocculators using full-scale three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamic (CFD) turbulence models to simulate hydraulics, combined with data obtained in jar tests to estimate optimal mixing conditions for coagulation [velocity gradient (G-values)]. The CFD model was first run for several barrier configurations. The optimal structure was then tested for different ratios of distance between barriers [or opening slot width (B)] and flocculator width (W). The relationship between distribution of G-values and the target value of 40-60 s(-1) was determined for different designs. The best B/W ratio was found to be 1/4. For this ratio, the flow depth was the only variable parameter that needed to be optimized by the CFD model to achieve target G-values. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Drained peatlands aremajor sources of CO2 to the atmosphere, yet the effects of land management and hydrological extremes have been little-studied at spatial scales relevant to agricultural enterprises. We measured fluxes of CO2 using the eddy covariance (EC) technique at two adjacent dairy farms on a drained peatland in Aotearoa New Zealand with remaining peat depths 5.5-8 m. One site (SD) had shallow surface drains and mean water table depth (WTD) -657 mm, while the other site (BD) had deep field border drains and mean WTD -838 mm. Net ecosystem CO2 production (NEP) was similar at the two sites when the soils were moist but diverged during late-summer drying, with site BD having 4.56 t C ha(-1) greater CO2 emission than site SD over the four-month dry period. Soil drying reduced gross primary production (GPP) at both sites, while ecosystem respiration (ER) was reduced at site SD but not at site BD. The low dry season respiration rates at site SD contributed to near-zero annual NEP, while higher respiration rates at site BD led to annual CO2 loss of -4.95 +/- 0.59 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). Accounting for other imports and exports of carbon, annual net ecosystem carbon balances were -2.23 and -8.47 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) at sites SD and BD, respectively. It is likely that the contrasting dry season respiration rates resulted from differences in soil physical properties affecting soil moisture vertical redistribution and availability to plants and microbes rather than from the relatively small differences in WTD. These differences could be caused by soil physical disturbances during pasture renewal or paddock recontouring, or time since initial drainage. Therefore, improved soil management might provide practical mitigation against excessive CO2 emissions during dry conditions, including droughts. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) are the only biological sinks for methane (CH4). Drainage of peatlands is known to decrease overall CH4 emission, but the effect on MOB is unknown. The objective of this work was to characterize the MOB community and activity in two ecohydrologically different pristine peatland ecosystems, a fen and a bog, and their counterparts that were drained in 1961. Oligotrophic fens are groundwater-fed peatlands, but ombrotrophic bogs receive additional water and nutrients only from rainwater. The sites were sampled in August 2003 down to 10 cm below the water table (WT), and cores were divided into 10-cm subsamples. CH4 oxidation was measured by gas chromatography (GC) to characterize MOB activity. The MOB community structure was characterized by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing methods using partial pmoA and mmoX genes. The highest CH4 oxidation rates were measured from the subsamples 20-30 and 30-40 cm above WT at the pristine oligotrophic fen (12.7 and 10.5 mu mol CH4 dm(-3) h(-1), respectively), but the rates decreased to almost zero in the vicinity of WT. In the pristine ombrotrophic bog, the highest oxidation rate at 0-10 cm was lower than in the fen (8.10 mu mol CH4 dm(-3) h(-1)), but in contrast to the fen, oxidation rates of 4.5 mu mol CH4 dm(-3) h(-1) were observed at WT and 10 cm below WT. Drainage reduced the CH4 oxidation rates to maximum values of 1.67 and 5.77 mu mol CH4 dm(-3) h(-1) at 30-40 and 20-30 cm of the fen and bog site, respectively. From the total of 13 pmoA-derived DGGE bands found in the study, 11, 3, 6, and 2 were observed in the pristine fen and bog and their drained counterparts, respectively. According to the nonmetric multidimensional scaling of the DGGE banding pattern, the MOB community of the pristine fen differed from the other sites. The majority of partial pmoA sequences belonged to type I MOB, whereas the partial mmoX bands that were observed only in the bog sites formed a distinct group relating more to type II MOB. This study indicates that fen and bog ecosystems differ in MOB activity and community structure, and both these factors are affected by drainage.

AB A prerequisite for sustainable peatland forestry is sufficiently low water table (WT) level for profitable tree production. This requires better understanding on controls and feedbacks between tree stand and its evapotranspiration, drainage network condition, climate, and WT levels. This study explores the role of spatial tree stand distribution in the spatiotemporal distribution of WT levels and site water balance. A numerical experiment was conducted by a three-dimensional (3-D) hydrological model (FLUSH) applied to a 0.5 ha peatland forest assuming (1) spatially uniform interception and transpiration, (2) interception and transpiration scaled with spatial distributions of tree crown and root biomass, and (3) the combination of spatially scaled interception and uniform transpiration. Site water balance and WT levels were simulated for two meteorologically contrasting years. Spatial variations in transpiration were found to control WT levels even in a forest with relatively low stand stem volume (<100 m(3)/ha). Forest management scenarios demonstrated how stand thinning and reduced drainage efficiency raised WT levels and increased the area and duration of excessively wet conditions having potentially negative economic (reduced tree growth) and environmental (e.g., methane emissions, phosphorus mobilization) consequences. In practice, silvicultural treatment manipulating spatial stand structure should be optimized to avoid emergence of wet spots.

AB Spruce mires are rare and endangered plant communities of central and western Europe. In the Czech Republic, they were intensively destroyed and drained during the 1970s. To start the regeneration of spruce mires, palisade dams sealed with peat were used to block draining ditches in the Giant Mountains. Four years after construction of the dams, there were significant differences in vegetation above and below the dams. Vegetation above the dams successfully developed towards plant communities characteristic to spruce mire forests. Below the dams, the colonization by forest floor species continued. These differences indicate that palisade dams effectively retain water and help the regeneration of spruce mire forests. Our results support construction of palisade dams in such habitats.

AB We determined the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) of 193 samples of water collected from groundwater, porewater, drainage ditches, and streams at peatlands in New Zealand. There was a wide range in DOC concentration (from 7 to 184 mg litre(-1)), with the smallest concentrations in peatlands where there appeared to be large amounts of iron. Concentrations were large (generally > 50 mg litre(-1)) in ombrotrophic (rain-fed) peatlands and reached the highest values (averaging 81 to 129 mg litre(-1)) in water collected from the Torehape peatland (Waikato region) , which is undergoing drainage and harvesting for peat and post-harvest restoration. These high DOC concentrations suggest that New Zealand peatlands export 10 to 50g DOC m(-2) yr(-1), a significant part of the overall carbon budget of peatlands. Most SUVA measurements ranged from 1.5 to 3.5 litre/mg DOC-1/m(-1)) and suggest that the DOC contains 12 to 25% aromatics.

Changes in drainage associated with forestry alter these greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and thus the radiative forcing (RF) of peatlands. In this paper, changes in peat and tree stand C stores, GHG fluxes and the consequent RF of Finnish undisturbed and forestry-drained peatlands are estimated for 1900-2100. The C store in peat is estimated at 5.5 Pg in 1950. The rate of C sequestration into peat has increased from 2.2 Tg a(-1) in 1900, when all peatlands were undrained, to 3.6 Tg a(--1) at present, when c . 60% of peatlands have been drained for forestry. The C store in tree stands has increased from 60 to 170 Tg during the 20th century. Methane emissions have decreased from an estimated 1.0-0.5 Tg CH4-C a(-1) , while those of N2O have increased from 0.0003 to 0.005 Tg N-2 O-N a(-1). The altered exchange rates of GHG gases since 1900 have decreased the RF of peatlands in Finland by about 3 mW m(--2) from the predrainage situation. This result contradicts the common hypothesis that drainage results in increased C emissions and therefore increased RF of peatlands. The negative radiative forcing due to drainage is caused by increases in CO2 sequestration in peat (-0.5 mW m(-2)), tree stands and wood products (-0.8 mW m(2) ), decreases in CH4 emissions from peat to the atmosphere (-1.6 mW m(-2)), and only a small increase in N2O emissions (+0.1 mW m(-2) ). Although the calculations presented include many uncertainties, the above results are considered qualitatively reliable and may be expected to be valid also for Scandinavian countries and Russia, where most forestry-drained peatlands occur outside Finland.

AB The restoration of drained afforested peatlands, through drain blocking and tree removal, is increasing in response to peatland restoration targets and policy incentives. In the short term, these intensive restoration operations may affect receiving watercourses and the biota that depend upon them. This study assessed the immediate effect of 'forest-to-bog' restoration by measuring stream and river water quality for a 15 month period pre- and post-restoration, in the Flow Country peatlands of northern Scotland. We found that the chemistry of streams draining restoration areas differed from that of control streams following restoration, with phosphate concentrations significantly higher (1.7-6.2 fold, mean 4.4) in restoration streams compared to the pre-restoration period. This led to a decrease in the pass rate (from 100 to 75%) for the target "good" quality threshold (based on EU Water Framework Directive guidelines) in rivers in this immediate post-restoration period, when compared to unaffected river baseline sites (which fell from 100 to 90% post-restoration). While overall increases in turbidity, dissolved organic carbon, iron, potassium and manganese were not significant post-restoration, they exhibited an exaggerated seasonal cycle, peaking in summer months in restoration streams. We attribute these relatively limited, minor short-term impacts to the fact that relatively small percentages of the catchment area (3-23%), in our study catchments were felled, and that drain blocking and silt traps, put in place as part of restoration management, were likely effective in mitigating negative effects. Looking ahead, we suggest that future research should investigate longer term water quality effects and compare different ways of potentially controlling nutrient release.

AB Reducing the strain on water bodies caused by sediment loads released after ditch network maintenance (DNM) is addressed in operational peatland forestry by implementing sediment control structures in ditches. This study evaluates computationally alternative sediment control scenarios in a 5.2 ha deep peat site in eastern Finland. Coupled to a distributed hydrological model, peat erosion and transport in the ditches were simulated for the first year after DNM with 15 scenarios consisting of individual structures (e.g., sedimentation ponds) and their combinations. One scenario represented the prevailing conditions with a V-notch weir at the catchment outlet. All scenarios were evaluated against a baseline scenario in which no structures affected the catchment sediment processes. The results suggested that bed erosion can be efficiently prevented with breaks in cleaning and structures ponding water. It was proven less efficient to trap already eroded material with sedimentation ponds and pits. The structures raising ditch water level had limited effects on water table levels in the strips between ditches, plausibly not impairing tree growth. The process-based modeling presented here provided a yet unexplored approach to comprehensively evaluating alternatives for sediment control, which is highly needed to address the gap between existing scientific knowledge and operational peatland forestry practices.

AB Linear regression functions are presented for predicting the volume increment and yield of peatland stands on sites drained far forestry in southern Finland. The data were collected from 329 permanent sample plots measured over a 70-yr period. Site was incorporated into the functions by means of four post-drainage classes (I-IV). These site classes were derived from the functional relationships between the post-drainage yield (total yield minus initial stand volume) at a reference time of 40 yr since drainage within the 21 vegetational site types represented in the data. The growth and yield functions were derived separately for each yield class. Stand volume, stem number, age since drainage, effective temperature sum, peat depth, and ditch spacing were used as predictors in the growth and yield functions. A site classification table, based on stand dominant height, drainage age, and initial volume, is presented for determining the yield class when applying the functions. Yield class can also be determined from the vegetational site types widely used in Finland. The reliability of the forecasts primarily depends on the quality of the data used in deriving the functions and on the input data in an application situation. Care should be taken when applying the functions to long-term simulations of future post-drainage growth and yield, where the growth and yield functions can be applied together.

AB This study evaluates the hydrological conditions in a harvested bog where various water management schemes have been implemented to ameliorate conditions limiting Sphagnum regeneration. The study sites included a natural bog (natural), a recently drained and harvested bog (drained), which provided the hydrological extremes. Also included are a drained harvested bog with ditches blocked with (1) no other management (blocked), (2) peat bounded by open water at 5-m intervals (5-m), and (3) with straw mulch on the surface (mulch).
   The study period from May to September 1995 was drier than normal. The water table in the drained site descended to -107 cm by late August, compared with -72.5 cm at the blocked site. Both the 5-m and mulch sites (ditches also blocked) had water table recessions similar to the natural site (minimum approx. 62 cm). In the drained and blocked sites, little variation in water table depth occurred after early July, suggesting water exchanges with the atmosphere occurred to and from the unsaturated zone only. Soil moisture in the upper 3 cm layer on the drained and blocked site were similar, in spite of greatly different water table depths, dropping below 20% by volume, compared with a minimum of 30% when mulch was used. Soil water tension profiles suggest most of this storage change occurred in the upper 30 cm. The water table depth, therefore, was not a good indicator of water availability at the surface.
   Pressure head in the unsaturated zone (1 cm below the surface) in the drained and blocked sites was maintained between 0 and -100 cm (mb) 18 and 34% of the time, respectively, and with water management with open water (5-m) and mulch, increased to 55 and 97% of the time, respectively. The greatest tension, however, was observed on the blocked site (-355 cm), rather than the drained site (-247 cm), suggesting lower suitability for Sphagnum at the former. This was attributed to the higher bulk density (hence smaller pore structure) at the blocked site (rho(b) = 92.1 kg compared with 55.7 kg m(-3)). Higher bulk density at the blocked site was ascribed to its longer time since disturbance. This implies' restoration should begin as soon as possible after harvesting is finished.

AB Restoration of wet grassland communities on peat soils involves management of nutrient supply and hydrology. The concept of nutrient limitation was discussed as well as its interaction with drainage and rewetting of severely drained peat soils. Different methods of assessing nutrient limitation were compared and the type and extent of nutrient limitation were determined for several wet grassland communities. It was concluded that a full-factorial field fertilisation experiment is the most preferable method. Plant tissue analyses and soil chemical analyses were considered less suitable, although they may provide helpful additional information. Fertilisation experiments in the laboratory using sods or using test plants appear to be the proper means to study mechanisms or processes, but have a restricted predictive value for field situations. Generalising the results, it seems that many relativily undisturbed grassland plant communities on peaty soils are characterised by N limitation. Phosphate limitation for vegetation on peat soils is mainly observed in specific circumstances such as extreme calcium richness, high concentrations of Fe or as a result of drainage or long-term hay cropping. The latter two may also cause K limitation. Rewetting is regarded as a prerequisite in restoring wet grassland communities. Further restoration measures to influence nutrient availability depend on aims of the management and the individual site conditions.

AB Managed northern peatlands are an important source of the strong greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). However, N2O emissions from these managed peatlands display a high spatial variability, and processes governing N2O production and emissions from these ecosystems are still not well understood. To constrain the factors regulating N2O emissions from managed northern peat soils, we determined a wide set of soil physical and chemical properties of peatlands with different management histories spread across Finland, Sweden and Iceland. We included eleven peatland sites with available in situ N2O flux data, and complemented our analyses with detailed measurements of soil nitrogen (N) cycling processes such as N2O production, gross N mineralization and gross nitrification and, in addition, soil microbial biomass. This study included drained peatlands with different land-use types and management intensities, comprising forested, cultivated or only drained peatlands and afforested or abandoned agricultural peatlands. All selected peatland sites displayed a low soil carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of 15-27, traditionally used to predict high N2O emissions. Despite the narrow C/N range, the N2O emissions at our sites varied greatly within and between land-use groups, ranging from 0.03 to 2.38 g N m(-2) y(-1). Thus, our findings provide valuable insights into the regulatory factors underlying the variability in N2O emissions and show that a low C/N ratio in managed peatlands cannot be used to predict high N2O emissions. Instead, our results demonstrate that higher N2O emissions are linked to higher peat phosphorus (P) and copper (Cu) content, suggesting that low P and Cu concentrations can limit N2O production in peat even with sufficient N availability. While known factors such as soil moisture, oxygen content and the degree of peat humification partially explained the variability in N2O emissions, this study directly links soil P and Cu availability to N2O production processes. The availability of P and especially Cu seemed to promote nitrification activities, thereby increasing N2O production. Our study highlights the link between N2O emissions and soil P and Cu availability and the strong coupling of the soil N and P cycles in peatlands, which is to date severely understudied.

AB In drained peatland forests ditch networks need regular maintenance operations in order to sustain their drainage capacity. These operations however have a significant impact on the quality of the runoff water from the ditched areas. Peak runoff control (PRC) method has been proposed as a possible method to diminish the load to water courses through retention of the runoff temporarily in the ditch network during maximum runoff events using dams with a plastic control pipe. However, blocking water into the ditched area for periods of varying length during the growing season may have a negative impact on the growth of the tree stands. In this study past stand growth was investigated in Central Finland in altogether 10 sample Scots pine thinning stands in which the PRC method has been applied 5 growing seasons earlier. In each stand, a pair of sample plots was established: one plot next to the dam within the influence of periodic flooding and the other one outside the effect of periodic flooding. For determining stand growth, field measurements were made in August 2009. Stand growth near the dam was on average 0.54 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1) lower than farther away from the dam but the analysis of covariance showed that the dam effect was not significant. The results of this study suggest that the PCR method does not decrease Scots pine stand growth during the first five year growth period after ditch cleaning.

AB Grasslands established on drained peat soils are regarded as negligible methane (CH4) sources; however, they can still exhibit considerable soil CH4 dynamics. We investigated archaeal community composition in two different fen peat soils and one bog peat soil under permanent grassland in Denmark. We used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) fingerprinting and clone libraries to characterize the soils' archaeal community composition to gain a better understanding of relationships between peat properties and land use, respectively, and CH4 dynamics. Samples were taken at three different depths and at four different seasons. Archaeal community composition varied considerably between the three peatlands and, to a certain degree, also with peat depth, but seemed to be quite stable at individual sampling depths throughout the year. Archaeal community composition was mainly linked to soil pH. No methanogens were detected at one fen site with soil pH ranging from 3.2 to 4.4. The methanogenic community of the bog (soil pH 3.9-4.6) was dominated by hydrogenotrophs, whereas the second fen site (soil pH 5.0-5.3) comprised both aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Overall, there seemed to be a significant coupling between peat type and archaeal community composition, with local hydrology modifying the strength of this coupling.

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are priority pollutants that arrive in the environment from numerous anthropogenic and natural sources, but the data on their natural sources including wildfires remain insufficient. The level of contamination and the composition of PAHs in soils of the areas affected by wildfires were studied in this work. The study was conducted in the Moscow region (Russia) in areas occupied by drained peatland and strongly damaged by fires in 2002, 2010 and 2012. The features of PAH accumulation and the profile distributions in histosols and histic podzols after the fires of different times were analyzed. It was shown that new soil horizons formed after the fires - Cpir, Hpir and incipient O horizons - and that these horizons differ in PAH accumulation rate. Maximal total concentrations of 14 PAHs were detected in charred peat horizons Hpir (up to 330 ng g(-1)) and in post-fire incipient O horizons (up to 180 ng g 1), but the high-molecular-weight PAHs (benz(ghi)perylene, benz(a)pyrene, benz(k)fluoranthene) were revealed only in charry peat horizons. The trends of higher PAH concentrations were found in cases when smoldering combustion resulted in rather thick residual peat horizons. In cases of almost complete pyrogenic destruction of He horizons, total PAH concentrations were no more than 50 ng g(-1). Also, PAH accumulation in upper horizons of soils near the sites of the latest fires was observed.

AB Forested peatlands contain large pools of terrestrial carbon. As well as drainage, forest management such as fertilizer application can affect these pools. We studied the effect of wood ash (application rates 0, 5 and 15 t ha-1) on the heterotrophic soil respiration (CO2 efflux), cellulose decomposition, soil nutrients, biomass production and amount of C accumulated in a tree stand on a pine-dominated drained mire in central Finland. The ash was spread 13 years before the respiration measurements. The annual CO2 efflux was statistically modelled using soil temperature as the driving variable. Wood ash application increased the amounts of mineral nutrients of peat substantially and increased soil pH in the uppermost 10 cm layer by 1.52 pH units. In the surface peat, the decomposition rate of cellulose in the ash plots was roughly double that in control plots. Annual CO2 efflux was least on the unfertilized site, 238 g CO2-C m-2 year-1. The use of wood ash nearly doubled CO2 efflux to 420475 g CO2-Cm-2 year-1 on plots fertilized with 515 t ha-1 of ash, respectively. Furthermore, ash treatments resulted also in increased stand growth, and during the measurement year, the growing stand on ash plots accumulated carbon 1112 times faster than the control plot. The difference between peat C emission and amount of C sequestered by trees on the ash plots was 4358 g C m-2, while on the control plot it was 204 g C m-2. Our conclusion is that adding wood ash as a fertilizer increases more C sequestration in the tree stand than C efflux from the peat.

AB The environmental importance of peatlands has stimulated efforts to restore their specific ecosystem structure and functions. Monitoring and assessment of the ecological state of the peatland is fundamental in restoration programmes. Most studies have focused on the responses of vegetation and, to a lesser extent, on testate amoebae (TA). To our knowledge, none have investigated whether these two groups show concordance in the context of restoration of drained peatland. Here we assess community concordance between TA and vegetation in boreal peatlands belonging to four different land use management classes (natural, drained, restored 3-7 years ago, and restored 9-12 years ago). TA and vegetation communities were concordant when all of the studied sites were compared. However, there was no concordance within management classes except for sites restored 3-7 years ago. We found that TA and vegetation communities are not surrogates of one another when measuring the success of restoration, and that thorough studies of both communities are required to build a holistic understanding of the changes during restoration from an ecosystem perspective. TA seemed to respond faster to changes caused by restoration and, hence, could be better early indicators of restoration success than plants. Furthermore, studies of the relationships between TA and plant communities could provide important insights to aid understanding of the link between the recovery of ecosystem structure and the reinstatement of ecosystem functions.

ID FIRE DETECTION ALGORITHM; FOREST; GEOWEB; SYSTEM
AB Haze over Sumatera and Kalimantan has been a prolonged trans-boundary issue in South East Asia mainly due to setting fire to drained peatland. At present, fire sources (i.e. hotspots) are located based on satellite data. Sensors such as MODIS and AVHRR detect extremes in average temperatures of an area. The hotspots have low spatial resolution and large spatial footprints, thus making it harder to detect fires. This research proposed a ground-based spatial validation of satellite data based on crowdsourcing in order to obtain more accurate estimates of the location and severity of the fire. We developed an Android application for reporting and validating fires in peatlands. Crowd data collected were integrated with satellite hotspot data by the dashboard system as a monitoring platform for government agencies. The 110,888 hectares of Padang Island, in Riau Province, were chosen as the study area given its vulnerability to peatland fire and imminent danger of subsidence as the collateral effect of draining peatlands. Residents of Padang Island tested the use-case scenario of the app to assess its applicability. The study showed the potential use of mobile apps for local communities to help the government validate hotspots for haze mitigation.

ID TABLE
AB Hydrologic drainage criteria that describe the position of the water table between adjacent ditches are commonly used to assess the initial effectiveness of peatland drainage projects for tree growth improvement. However, these criteria do not reflect the soil conditions that regulate tree growth and performance after drainage. The effect of three drainage ditch spacings (30, 40, and 50 m) on the spatial variability of soil water conditions at three drained boreal Alberta peatlands was studied. Soil water content (0-30 cm depth) was found to be insensitive (p = 0.686) to drainage ditch spacing several years after drainage. Greater variation was observed between different sampling locations (p = 0.024) relative to the position of the ditch edge within similar ditch spacings. Spatial distribution of soil water in the unsaturated zone was found to be inversely related to the degree of water table lowering. Spatial patterns of soil water content were strongly associated with changes to substrate bulk density resulting from postdrainage peatland subsidence.

AB 1. Components of the CO2 balance for a drained minerotrophic fen and a drained ombrotrophic bog were measured for permanent plots using static chamber techniques for 1 year before and 2 years after a rewetting treatment in part of both sites. During the same period, changes in ground and bottom layer vegetation composition were monitored.
   2. After the treatment, the water table rose, the average increase being 25 cm for the fen site and 20 cm for the bog site. In the untreated areas the average water table remained at the pretreatment level.
   3. There was a clear change in vegetation composition in the rewetted area of the fen site where the cover of cottongrass Eriophorum vaginatum L. increased drastically. The change in vegetation composition seemed to be dependent on the nutrient status of the sites, being faster at the more nutrient-rich fen site.
   4. The rates of CO2 efflux from the soil surface decreased on those rewetted plots where all vegetation had been removed. In 1996, the CO2 efflux rates from the soil surface of the untreated plots were about twice as high as from the rewetted plots with a high water table.
   5. The change in water table levels and vegetation composition affected the seasonal (mid-May to end of September) CO2-C balances. For the rewetted area of the fen site, the CO2-C balance varied from 162 to 283 g m(-2), being greatest in a plot with dense E. vaginatum cover and a high water table. For the rewetted area of the bog site, the CO2-C balance varied from 54 to 101 g m(-2), being greatest in a hollow-level plot with a high water table and mire vegetation. For the untreated areas, the CO2-C balance was close to zero (3 g m(-2) at the bog site) or negative (-183 g m(-2) at the fen site), when carbon fixation by the tree stand was omitted.
   6. The results are encouraging from the practical point of view as restoration of both fen and bog sites initiated vegetation succession and CO2-C balance development towards those of pristine mires.

AB Rewetting drained peatlands creates favorable reduced conditions for denitrification, but, the potential of restored peatlands to act as N2O sink is poorly characterized. We monitored N2O emissions in rewetted peatlands converted to rice paddies with a range of soil organic carbon (SOC) (6%, 11%, and 23%) during the growing season. Negative N2O emissions were repeatedly observed in all sites, which were not affected by nitrogen fertilization at 80 kg N ha(-1). The highest consumption rates amounted to 8.2 tones CO2 eq ha(-1) yr(-1), 32% of the average CO2 emissions from drained peat soils. Porewater N2O concentrations were frequently less than the calculated in situ N2O equilibrium concentrations, suggesting diffusional constraints on atmospheric N2O into pore water. Redox potentials were correlated to N2O emission rates (r(2) = 0.40, p < 0.01). However, relatively higher frequencies and magnitudes of negative N2O emissions were mostly observed during the period of water draw down for rice harvest activities, especially in the field with the highest SOC. It is likely that reducing water depth by drainage reduced the diffusional barrier for atmospheric N2O into the soil. In all, the capacity of rewetted peatlands to act as atmospheric N2O sinks can be significant and seemingly can be managed through manipulating water depths. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aim of the study was to compare the effects of phosphorus fertilisers of different solubility and different phosphorus doses. The material was collected from 8 field experiments situated on drained peatlands in southern and central Finland (60 degrees-65 degrees N). The sites were drained, oligotrophic pine fens and pine bogs, which had been fertilised between 1961 and 1977 with different combinations of N, K and P. In 1991-94 stand measurements and foliar and peat sampling were carried out on 162 sample plots.
   Apatite, rock phosphate and superphosphate affected basal area growth to a rather similar extent. However, apatite slightly surpassed superphosphate and rock phosphate at the end of the study period in two hollow-rich S. fuscum bogs. Higher doses of phosphorus did not significantly increase the basal area growth. The foliar phosphorus concentrations clearly reflected the effect of the P fertilisation. Especially on the pine bogs basic fertilisation with 66 kg P/ha maintained the needle phosphorus concentrations at a satisfactory level for more than 25 years after fertilisation. The amount of phosphorus in the 0-20 cm peat layer was not significantly increased either by basic fertilisation or refertilisation. The phosphorus reserves in the peat in the individual experiments were between 88 and 327 kg/ha. There was a strong correlation between the amounts of phosphorus and iron in the peat. Large amounts of iron in peat may reduce the solubility and availability of phosphorus.
   According to the foliar phosphorus concentrations in the basic-fertilised plots, the need for refertilisation seems to be unnecessary during the 25-year postfertilisation period at least. None of the basic fertilisation treatments seriously retarded the basal area growth compared to the refertilised treatments. There seems to be a greater shortage of potassium than of phosphorus, because the foliar potassium concentrations and the amounts of potassium in the 0-20 cm peat layer were very low in several of the experiments.

AB Terrestrial organic carbon is exported to freshwater systems where it serves as substrate for bacterial growth. Temporal variations in the terrigenous organic carbon support for aquatic bacteria are not well understood. In this paper, we demonstrate how the combined influence of landscape characteristics and hydrology can shape such variations. Using a 13-day bioassay approach, the production and respiration of bacteria were measured in water samples from six small Swedish streams (64A degrees N, 19A degrees E), draining coniferous forests, peat mires, and mixed catchments with typical boreal proportions between forest and mire coverage. Forest drainage supported higher bacterial production and higher bacterial growth efficiency than drainage from mires. The areal export of organic carbon was several times higher from mire than from forest at low runoff, while there was no difference at high flow. As a consequence, mixed streams (catchments including both mire and forest) were dominated by mire organic carbon with low support of bacterial production at low discharge situations but dominated by forest carbon supporting higher bacterial production at high flow. The stimulation of bacterial growth during high-flow episodes was a result of higher relative export of organic carbon via forest drainage rather than increased drainage of specific "high-quality" carbon pools in mire or forest soils.

AB Drained peatlands are important sources of greenhouse gases and are rewetted to curb these emissions. We study one drained and one rewetted fen in terms of losses-and, after rewetting-gains of organic matter (OM), carbon (C), and peat thickness. We determined bulk density (BD) and ash/OM (and C/OM) ratios for 0.5 cm thick contiguous slices from peat monoliths to calculate losses. Whereas one site has lost 28.5 kg OM m(-2) corresponding to annual emissions of similar to 10 t CO2 ha(-1) a(-1) over 50 years of effective drainage, the other site has lost 102 kg OM m(-2), corresponding to an annual loss of similar to 30 t CO2 ha(-1) a(-1) for 30 years of intensive drainage and 6 t CO2 ha(-1) a(-1) during similar to 225 years of weak drainage before that. Height losses ranged from 43 to 162 cm. In the 20 years after rewetting, 2.12 kg C m(-2) was accumulated, equaling an average annual uptake of similar to 0.4 kg CO2 m(-2) a(-1). The results indicate that rewetting can lead to carbon accumulation in fens. This sink function is only small compared with the high emissions that are avoided through rewetting.

AB Sphagnum farming - the production of Sphagnum biomass on rewetted bogs - helps towards achieving global climate goals by halting greenhouse gas emissions from drained peat and by replacing peat with a renewable biomass alternative. Large-scale implementation of Sphagnum farming requires a wide range of know-how, from initial species selection up to the final production and use of Sphagnum biomass based growing media in horticulture. This article provides an overview of relevant knowledge accumulated over the last 15 years and identifies open questions.

AB Fens in Central Europe are characterised by waterlogged organic substrate and low productivity. Human-induced changes due to drainage and mowing lead to changes in plant species composition from natural fen communities to fen meadows and later to over-drained, degraded meadows. Moderate drainage leads to increased vegetation productivity, and severe drainage results in frequent soil disturbances and less plant growth. In the present article, we analyse changes in plant trait combinations in the vegetation and the soil seed bank as well as changes in the seed bank types along gradient of drainage intensity. We hypothesize that an increase in productivity enhances traits related to persistence and that frequent disturbance selects for regeneration traits. We use multivariate statistics to analyse data from three disturbance levels: undisturbed fen, slightly drained fen meadow and severely drained degraded meadow. We found that the abundance of plants regenerating from seeds and accumulating persistent seed banks was increasing with degradation level, while plants reproducing vegetatively were gradually eliminated along the same trajectory. Plants with strong resprouting abilities increased during degradation. We also found that shifts in trait combinations were similar in the aboveground vegetation and in soil seed banks. We found that the density of short-term persistent seeds in the soil is highest in fen meadows and the density of long-term persistent seeds is highest in degraded meadows. The increase in abundance of species with strong regeneration traits at the cost of species with persistence-related traits has negative consequences for the restoration prospects of severely degraded sites.

AB Prediction of the effect of harvests and climate change (CC) on the changes in carbon stock of forests is necessary both for CC mitigation and adaptation purposes.
   We assessed the impact of roundwood and fuelwood removals and climate change (CC) on the changes in carbon stock of Finnish forests during 2007-2042. We considered three harvest scenarios: two based on the recent projections of roundwood and fuelwood demand, and the third reflecting the maximum sustainable cutting level. We applied two climate scenarios: the climate was in the state that prevailed around year 2006, or it changed according to the IPCC SRES A1B scenario.
   We combined the large-scale forestry model MELA with the soil carbon model Yasso07 for mineral soils. For soils of drained, forested peatlands, we used a method based on emission factors.
   The stock change of trees accounted for approximately 80 % of the total stock change. Trees and mineral soils acted as carbon sinks and the drained peatland soils as a carbon source. The forest carbon sink increased clearly in both of the demand-based scenarios, reaching the level of 13-20 Tg C/year (without CC). The planned increase in the use of bioenergy reduced the forest sink by 2.6 Tg C/year. CC increased the forest carbon sink in 2042 by 38 %-58 % depending on the scenario. CC decreased the sink of mineral soils in the initial years of the simulations; after 2030, the effect was slightly positive. CC increased the emissions from the drained peatland soils.
   It is likely that forest land in Finland acts as a carbon sink in the future. The changes in carbon stocks of trees, mineral soils, and peatland soils respond differently to CC and fuelwood and roundwood harvests.

AB To provide a reference for wetlands elsewhere we analysed soil nutrients and the vegetation of floodplains and fens in the relatively undisturbed Biebrza-valley, Poland. Additionally, by studying sites along a water-table gradient, and by comparing pairs of mown and unmown sites, we aimed with exploring long-term effects of drainage and annual hay-removal on nutrient availabilities and vegetation response. In undrained fens and floodplains, N mineralization went slowly (0-30 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) but it increased strongly with decreasing water table (up to 120 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). Soil N, P and K pools were small in the undisturbed mires. Drainage had caused a shift from fen to meadow species and the disappearance of bryophytes. Biomass of vascular plants increased with increasing N mineralization and soil P. Annual hay-removal tended to have reduced N mineralization and soil K pools, but it had increased soil P. Moreover, N concentrations in vascular plants were not affected, but P and K concentrations and therefore N:P and N:K ratios tended to be changed. Annual hay-removal had induced a shift from P to K limitation in the severely drained fen, and from P to N limitation in the floodplain. The low nutrient availabilities and productivity of the undisturbed Biebrza mires illustrate the vulnerability of such mires to eutrophication in Poland and elsewhere. In nutrient-enriched areas, hay removal may prevent productivity increase of the vegetation, but also may severely alter N:P:K stoichiometry, induce K-limitation at drained sites, and alter vegetation structure and composition.

DE fens; draining; navigation; Vermuyden; conflicts; re-assessment
AB Draining the Fens in the seventeenth century led to serious conflicts with navigation, conflicts which have not been properly understood in some important literature. Contrary to common belief, Vermuyden's scheme did incorporate navigation locks at Denver and elsewhere. Trade at King's Lynn and over the inland waterways did expand during the second half of the century. These facts lead to a re-assessment of the drainage/navigation interests, focussing on specific issues such as the funding arrangements for drainage and the damage to embankments by horses hauling vessels. Hence arise further questions about the understanding and motives underlying the public positions adopted by stakeholders. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The growth of Salix aurita is particularly active in the nature reserve of the Hautes-Fagnes : this species is colonising as well dry moorlands as drained peat-bogs only if those are not saturated with water. The plant communities occurring around the bushes of Salix aurita, considerably influence the maintenance of the young seedlings. Indeed, several field observations and an experimental approach, show that young seedlings can be often confronted with herbaceous competition, and too humid or allelopathic litter.

   Microbial activity
AB The peatlands of the Zoige Plateau are an important global carbon source that is currently under threat as a result of drainage for grazing. How drainage affects the microbial diversity and activity in peatlands is unclear. This study examined the response of microbial communities at two sites to short-term drainage (3 years) and long-term drainage (48 years) in combination with three different water table treatments. Our objective was to examine the changes in the physicochemical properties of the soil, composition of bacterial and fungal communities, and microbial activity. Our results indicated that (1) both duration of drainage and water table drawdown had significant effects on the diversity and composition of the bacterial and fungal communities in the soil, and certain bacteria were replaced by fungal decomposers; (2) duration of drainage affected the structure of fungal communities more than that of bacterial communities, and interactions between microbial species were more complex in peatlands with long-term drainage; (3) drainage significantly altered concentrations of dis solved inorganic nitrogen (NH4+-N and NO3--N), and these changes correlated with structure of bacterial and fungal communities as well as with changes in abundance of certain dominant microbial species; and (4) fungal communities explained a larger part of microbial activity than bacterial communities. Overall, these findings suggest that fungi play a much more important role than bacteria in microbial-mediated ecosystem functioning in peatlands undergoing drainage.

AB Forest harvesting, especially when intensified harvesting method as whole-tree harvesting with stump lifting (WTHs) are used, may increase mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) leaching to recipient water courses. The effect can be enhanced if the underlying bedrock and overburden soil contain Hg. The impact of stem-only harvesting (SOH) and WTHs on the concentrations of Hg and MeHg as well as several other variables in the ditch water was studied using a paired catchment approach in eight drained peatland-dominated catchments in Finland (2008-2012). Four of the catchments were on felsic bedrock and four on black schist bedrock containing heavy metals, Although both Hg and MeHg concentrations increased after harvesting in all treated sites according to the randomized intervention analyses (RIAs), there was only a weak indication of a harvest-induced mobilization of Hg and MeHg into the ditches. Furthermore, no clear differences between WTHs and SOH were found, although MeHg showed a nearly significant difference (p = 0.06) between the harvesting regimes. However, there was a clear bedrock effect, since the MeHg concentrations in the ditch water were higher at catchments on black schist than at those on felsic bedrock. The pH, suspended solid matter (SSM), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and iron (Fe) concentrations increased after harvest while the sulfate (SO4-S) concentration decreased. The highest abundances of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were found on the sites with high MeHg concentrations. The biggest changes in ditch water concentrations occurred first 2 years after harvesting.

AB Peatlands form a large but unstable C store. Drainage of peatlands converts them into C sources, which is undesirable if increases in atmospheric CO2 levels are to be minimised. Therefore, quantification of C stocks and an understanding of which ecosystems or management regimes are capturing or emitting C is needed. Such information is scarce for temperate European forests. We studied the soil properties of sixteen peatlands in Switzerland, representing three forest types, to test whether peatlands that are more strongly affected by drainage (according to vegetation) have lost their function as C sinks or stores. Bulk density and ash enrichment, as well as H/C, O/C and C/N quotients, indicated that the soils of the two forest types that appeared to be more strongly affected by drainage were more degraded and had lost their functions as C stores. Longterm net rates of C loss estimated using the ash residue method were similar across all three forest types, for sites where this could be estimated.

AB Drainage of peatlands for forestry causes the water level to draw down, which results in subsidence of peat surface and increased peat bulk density (D-b) Later on, an accelerated rate of organic matter decomposition and the pressure of the growing tree stand further compacts the peat. We measured the peat D-b (0-80 cm) in 180 undrained and 209 drained (ca. 60-year-old) peatland sites representing three nutrient levels of pine fens and five macroclimatic regions from southern to northern Finland. D-b was affected by climatic conditions, nutrient status, and the tree stand volume of the site. D-b was significantly higher in drained than in undrained sites in all regions and site types: the mean (+/-SD) D-b in the whole material was 82 +/- 23 kg.m(-3) for the undrained sites and 133 +/- 22 kg.m(-3) for the drained sites. The increase in D-b was significant in all regions down to a depth of 60 cm and in southern Finland, even deeper than 80 cm. When the increase in carbon concentration was taken into consideration, the average postdrainage increase in the Db Of the 0-80 cm layer equalled the amount of carbon in the 54-cm layer in average undrained peat. As the reported subsidences of pear surface in forest drainage areas in Finland are usually below this limit, the carbon storage of peat is likely to increase after drainage.

AB The hydrochemistry of 26 small blanket bog lakes was examined to assess the impact of conifer plantation forestry on lake water chemistry. Lakes were selected from three distinct catchment land use categories: i) unplanted blanket bog only present in the catchment, ii) mature (closed-canopy) conifer plantation forests only present in the catchment and iii) catchments containing mature conifer plantation forests with recently clearfelled areas. All three catchment land uses were replicated across two geologies: sedimentary (sandstone) and igneous (granite). Lakes with afforested catchments across both geologies had elevated concentrations of phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), total dissolved organic carbon (TDOC), aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe), with the highest concentrations of each parameter recorded from lakes with catchment clearfelling. Dissolved oxygen was also significantly reduced in the afforested lakes, particularly the clearfell lakes. Analysis of runoff from a nearby recently clearfelled site revealed high biological and chemical oxygen demands, consistent with at least part of the elevated concentrations of TDOC emanating from clearfelled sites having higher biochemical lability. Inorganic fertilisers applied at the start of the forest cycle, the decay of the underlying peat soil and accumulated surface tree litter, and leachate from felled trees are the likely sources of the elevated concentrations of plant nutrients, TDOC, heavy metals and major ions, with excessive peat soil disturbance during clearfelling likely exacerbating the runoff into lakes. Our study has demonstrated a clear, deleterious impact of conifer plantations on the water quality draining from blanket bog catchments, with major implications for the management of afforested peatlands.

AB The vegetation of two boreal mires drained for forestry was studied prior to and after restoration (removal of tree stand and filling in of ditches). The restoration induced a rapid rise in the water table level and caused relatively rapid changes in plant species composition and cover. On the minerotrophic fen site, the number of forest species declined and the cover of Eriophorum vaginatum increased five-fold, reaching over 50% cover in three years. On the ombrotrophic bog site, the terrestrial lichens disappeared, while the cover of Empetrum nigrum, Calluna vulgaris, Eriophorum vaginatum, and Sphagnum balticum increased. Changes in water table level and vegetation indicate a change towards a functional mire ecosystem.

AB Impacts of long-term drying and associated vegetation change on anaerobic decomposition, methane production, and pore water composition in peat bogs are poorly documented. To identify some of these impacts, we analyzed peat humification, pore water solutes, in situ and in vitro respiration rates, and Gibbs free energies of methanogenesis in a bog near a drainage ditch established in 1923. We compared drained peat under open bog vegetation and forest with a bog reference site. Drainage and tree growth induced an enrichment in carboxylic, aromatic, and phenolic moieties in the peat. Short-term in vitro respiration rates significantly decreased with humification (R (2) > 0.6, p < 0.01). Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CH4 concentrations also attained lower maxima in drained areas. However, near the water table in situ respiration intensified as indicated by steeper increases in DIC and CH4 concentrations than at the reference site, especially under forest. Maximum in situ CO2 production derived from inverse pore water modeling was 10.3 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) (forest) and 6.3 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) (bog) and was one to two orders of magnitude slower than in vitro anaerobic respiration. In the highly decomposed shallow peats under forest, methane production was suppressed and DOC concentration elevated. Raised H-2 concentrations (up to 200 nmol l(-1)) and in situ Gibbs free energies of down to -60 kJ mol(-1) (CH4) suggested an inhibition of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis by an unidentified factor at these sites. The study documents that several changes in biogeochemical process patterns do occur post-drainage, especially when tree growth is triggered. Most importantly, the establishment of forest on intensely humified peats can lower in situ methane production.

AB One of the most important threats to peatland ecosystems is drainage, resulting in encroachment of woody species. Our main aim was to check which features - overstorey or understorey vegetation - are more important for shaping the seedling bank of pioneer trees colonising peatlands (Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens). We hypothesised that tree stand parameters will be more important predictors of natural regeneration density than understorey vegetation parameters, and the former will be negatively correlated with species diversity and richness and also with functional richness and functional dispersion, which indicate a high level of habitat filtering. The study was conducted in the Zielone Bagna' nature reserve (NW Poland). We assessed the structure of tree stands and natural regeneration (of B.pubescens and P.sylvestris) and vegetation species composition. Random forest and DCA were applied to assess relationships between variables studied. Understorey vegetation traits affected tree seedling density (up to 0.5-m height) more than tree stand traits. Density of older seedlings depended more on tree stand traits. We did not find statistically significant relationships between natural regeneration densities and functional diversity components, except for functional richness, which was positively correlated with density of the youngest tree seedlings. Seedling densities were higher in plots with lower functional dispersion and functional divergence, which indicated that habitat filtering is more important than competition. Presence of an abundant seedling bank is crucial for the process of woody species encroachment on drained peatlands, thus its dynamics should be monitored in protected areas.

AB This study assessed the short-term impacts of ditch blocking on water table depth and vegetation community structure in a historically drained blanket bog. A chronosequence approach was used to compare vegetation near ditches blocked 5 years, 4 years and 1 year prior to the study with vegetation near unblocked ditches. Plots adjacent to and 3 m away from 70 ditches within an area of blanket bog were assessed for floristic composition, aeration depth using steel bars, and topography using LiDAR data. No changes in aeration depth or vegetation parameters were detected as a function of ditch blocking, time since blocking, or distance from the ditch, with the exception of non-Sphagnum bryophytes which had lower cover in quadrats adjacent to ditches that had been blocked for 5 years. Analysis of LiDAR data and the observed proximity of the water table to the peat surface led us to conclude that the subdued ecosystem responses to ditch-blocking were the result of historical peat subsidence within a 4-5 m zone either side of each ditch, which had effectively lowered the peat surface to the new, ditch influenced water table. We estimate that this process led to the loss of around 500,000 m(3) peat within the 38 km(2) study area following drainage, due to a combination of oxidation and compaction. Assuming that 50% of the volume loss was due to oxidation, this amounts to a carbon loss of 11,000 Mg C over this area, i.e. 3 Mg C ha(-1). The apparent 'self-rewetting' of blanket bogs in the decades following drainage has implications for their restoration as it suggests that there may not be large quantities of dry peat left to rewet, and that there is a risk of inundation (potentially leading to high methane emissions) along subsided ditch lines. Many peatland processes are likely to be maintained in drained blanket bog, including support of typical peatland vegetation, but infilling of lost peat and recovery of original C stocks are likely to take longer than is generally anticipated.

AB The field study was conducted on fifteen peat meadows located in the Biebrza river valley, north-eastern Poland, to estimate the range of changes in Lumbricidae communities with time after drainage. In a field experiment, the effects of L. rubellus were examined on the composition and abundance of microflora, Nematoda, Collembola, and Enchytraeidae, and on resources of exchangeable nutrients in drained peat soils.
   The occurrence of 2-6 earthworm species was noted in soils of drained peats. L. rubellus appeared already 3-5 years after drainage and rapidly reached high densities and biomass. It showed preference for moderately or heavily moorshed soils, with high contents of total nitrogen and phosphorus, low C/N, moderate porosity, and moderate moisture. Casts of this species contained more fungi and cellulolytic microorganisms, while less bacteria and actinomycetes, as compared with their contents in the soil. Also urease activity, content of fulvic acids and concentrations of exchangeable phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium were higher in casts.
   In a 4-month field experiment, different densities of L. rubellus were used: 2, 4, and 6 individuals in 1.5 L isolators inserted to soil. The control variant was without earthworms. It was found that high L. rubellus densities in peat moorsh enhanced bacteria, ammonifying microorganisms, microorganisms utilising mineral nitrogen, and seasonally also actinomycetes and cellulolytic microbes. Also total microbial biomass, dehydrogenase activity, and the rate of cellulose decomposition were higher. The abundance of soil fungi noticeably decreased.
   Moreover, L. rubellus significantly influenced nematode composition and abundance. Within a short time, their total numbers declined, especially numbers of bacterial-feeding nematodes. Also numbers and proportions of fungivorous nematodes slightly declined. Plant-feeding nematodes were least affected by this species, and in some periods their numbers were higher in the presence of earthworms than in the control. In the field experiment, no noticeable effect of earthworms was found on total enchytraeid numbers. In the period of autumn peak of Collembola, high numbers of L. rubellus reduced their densities.
   By modifying the composition and abundance of microflora, nematodes and, mesofauna, lit L. rubellus. densities (above 200 individuals m(-2)) can increase the rate of organic matter mineralization, intensify competition for nutrients, and indirectly they contribute to the biological decomposition of moorsh in soils of drained peat meadows.

AB Context Globally, the intensive use of peatlands contributes substantially to greenhouse gas emissions. The intensification of peatland use has led to increasing carbon (C) losses over the last centuries, but without historical emissions data, these increases and cumulative emissions are difficult to quantify. Objectives To understand the magnitude and development of soil C losses through peatland drainage in Switzerland through time, and to relate the situation of peatlands today to this historical development. Methods Historical records and a published estimate of the peatland extent are used to estimate peatlands' original extent and C stocks, and to understand trends in the historical use of peatlands. Land use-specific emission factors are applied to estimate the C emission through drainage over the last 300 years. Results Ca. 15 to 55 Mt C have been lost through peatland drainage in Switzerland. Despite a decrease in the area of organic soils, annual C emissions have increased considerably especially since the mid-twentieth century due to intensification of their use, particularly for agriculture. This C loss is a magnitude greater than that lost through extracted peat. Remaining C stocks approximate those lost over the last 300 years. Conclusions The rate of peatland surface loss in Switzerland is typical of European wetlands. Uncertainties in emission factors remain high and should be refined to justify any mitigation strategies. Although peat is no longer mined in Switzerland, future C emissions from peatlands will remain high as long as the effects of drainage networks and their current intensity of use persist.

AB Specific features of population and biotopic distribution of 8 species of amphibians in peat bogs of Tver Oblast were studied. A network of drainage canals and peat carriers became a main habitat of amphibians in the transformed bogs. The level of water acidity was shown to affect the success of reproduction in the common frog, Rana temporaria, and the moor frog, R. moor. At the same time, water acidity was not a decisive limiting factor for adult individuals of frogs, but it might be a cause of significant egg mortality. The egg mortality was assessed by the percentage of dead eggs just before hatching. The large size of clutches and their aggregations promoted the survival of embryos in their central parts. Temperature of water determined the intensity of frog reproduction at its initial stages.

AB Inland waters transport and emit into the atmosphere large amounts of carbon (C), which originates from terrestrial ecosystems. The effect of land cover and land-use practises on C export from terrestrial ecosystems to inland waters is not fully understood, especially in heterogeneous landscapes under human influence. We sampled for dissolved C species in five tributaries with well-determined subcatchments (total size 174.5km(2)), as well as in various points of two of the subcatchments draining to a boreal lake in southern Finland over a full year. Our aim was to find out how land cover and land-use affect C export from the catchments, as well as CH4 and CO2 concentrations of the streams, and if the origin of C in stream water can be determined from proxies for quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM). We further estimated the gas evasion from stream surfaces and the role of aquatic fluxes in regional C cycling. The export rate of C from the terrestrial system through an aquatic conduit was 19.3g Cm-2(catchment)yr(-1), which corresponds to 19% of the estimated terrestrial net ecosystem exchange of the catchment. Most of the C load to the recipient lake consisted of dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 6.1 +/- 1.0g Cm(-2)yr(-1)); the share of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was much smaller (1.0 +/- 0.2g Cm(-2)yr(-1)). CO2 and CH4 emissions from stream and ditch surfaces were 7.0 +/- 2.4g Cm(-2)yr(-1) and 0.1 +/- 0.04g Cm(-2)yr(-1), respectively, C emissions being thus equal with C load to the lake. The proportion of peatland in the catchment and the drainage density of peatland increased DOC in streams, whereas the proportion of agricultural land in the catchment decreased it. The opposite was true for DIC. Drained peatlands were an important CH4 source for streams.

AB Drained peatlands are known to be important sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). While CO2 emissions occur mainly during the growing season, large N2O emissions may occur during the non-growing season as well. Peatland re-wetting may be an effective measure to prevent those emissions. However, recent research shows that re-wetted peatlands may release large amounts of methane (CH4) during the years immediately after re-wetting whereas abandonment of intensive grassland on drained peat soils possibly leads to low nutrient supply and thus to small greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here we examine the role of extensification practices (such as abandonment of mineral fertilisation, reduced cutting frequency and a cattle-free winter period) on GHG emissions from a temperate peatland during winter. From November 2009 to March 2010 GHG measurements were made on a minerotrophic fen five years after intensive grassland use was abandoned. During the measurement period CO2 and N2O emissions amounted to 4.4 t ha(-1) and 2.6 t ha(-1) CO2-equivalent, whilst CH4 emissions were negligible. Altogether the site emitted 7 t ha(-1) CO2-equivalent, of which 37 % was N2O, even though the winter 2009/2010 was extraordinarily cold. Thus, extensification of grassland use alone may not be sufficient to reduce GHG emissions from temperate peatlands.

AB Drained peatlands are a global concern due to alterations of the water and carbon cycle, loss of habitat, and increased fire frequency. However, methods for restoring drained sloping peatlands are limited and poorly tested. Therefore, we measured water table dynamics, CO2 fluxes, and soil properties at four sloping fens that were restored (1-20years post-restoration) with the installation of small check dams in ditches that had drained the sites for a century. Restoration had a positive effect on water tables, increasing from approximately 45cm below the surface to approximately 15cm below the surface during the summers. Restoration also benefited CO2 fluxes, as the mean net ecosystem exchange was greatest in the restored areas (-2.19gCO(2)m(-2)hour(-1)) compared to the unrestored drained areas (-1.28gCO(2)m(-2)hour(-1)), while in reference areas it was -1.74gCO(2)m(-2)hour(-1). Drainage also caused significant changes to the peat soil including: 25% reduction in soil organic matter (lost between 1.4 to 3.6kg/m(2)), increased bulk density, decreased porosity, and reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity. Restoration did not affect these parameters, even 20years after restoration. This study suggests that although natural water table levels have been reestablished and the process of carbon sequestration improved, the physical properties of the most disturbed, near surface peat soils do not mimic reference conditions 20years post-restoration.

AB Background: In fens, plant species composition is predominantly controlled by two environmental factors: root anoxia and low nutrient availability. Aims: We asked how these filters were reflected to the functional structure of plant communities in natural and drained rich fens. Methods: We analysed traits related to species response to anoxia and nutrient availability, using single-trait and multi-trait approaches in fens of a river valley (Biebrza, Poland). We evaluated results concerning multi-trait indices using a null model consisting of simulated communities. Results: Mycorrhizal status and specific leaf area (SLA) clearly distinguished the communities with different levels of anoxia and nutrient deficiency. Mean values, ranges and variance of canopy height showed the differences in the distribution of plant heights among analysed communities. Conclusions: Functional traits distinguish plant communities of the most endangered mesotrophic fens from eutrophic and drained fens. We highlight the role of nutrient and oxygen deficiency in the assembly of fen vegetation and show the impact of the altered environment on the composition of communities in degraded habitats. We demonstrate that single-trait indices are suitable for identifying of environmental filtering in different types of fen communities. We suggest that caution is justified when using multi-trait indices to assess vegetation patterns.

AB The influence of mineral and organic nitrogen compounds (ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, hydroxylamine, urea) on the process of methane oxidation was studied in peat samples from a sphagnum bog in West Siberia. It was found that an increase in mineralization (introduction of sodium chloride) produced a significantly weaker inhibiting effect than the introduction of the same amounts of nitrogen salts. In peat samples, in contrast to methanotroph cultures and automorphic and drained peatland soils, the strongest inhibiting effect was produced by oxidized nitrogen compounds rather than by ammonium salts. The toxicity of intermediates of microbial ammonium oxidation increased in the following range: NH4+ < NH2+ < NO2- < NO3-.

AB In Northern, Eastern and Central European countries, peat soils drained for agriculture are a considerable source of greenhouse gas emissions. Since emissions from this source have high mitigation potential, they will likely be a focus of the European Union's future climate goals.
   We describe and compare the similarities and differences in the socioeconomic and ecological business environment that policy makers, planners and farmers are confronted with when developing tailored proposals for low emission land use alternatives on peat land. The analysis is based on interviews with 33 typical farmers cultivating organic soils and on expert group discussions held in six different Northern, Eastern and Central European regions.
   Based on the Social-Ecological System Framework we identify and cluster important variables. Our results show that mainly hard economic variables determine preferred land use alternatives: the productivity of resource systems, the economic value of land and market incentives. Other variables, such as the heterogeneity of users and conflicts among them, are more important with respect to the implementation of alternatives. We point out possibilities to transfer solutions between regions and discuss an institutional framework for European Union, national and regional levels for facilitating implementation potential.

ID HERBICIDES
AB Weed control poses a real challenge to agriculture in general, and to agriculture on drained peatlands in particular. An understanding of the interactions between clay minerals and organic molecules has yielded effective preparations of herbicide formulations. In most cases, binding the active ingredient to a suitable organoclay-based platform enhances activity by reducing migration of the herbicide to non-target depths, or by reducing degradation of the active ingredient. In this short communication, a formulation based on an organoclay and the herbicide acetochlor is compared with a commercial formulation. Efficiency was tested in two soils from the Hula Valley: a mineral, clay-based soil (with about 4 % organic matter) and a peat-derived soil with similar to 20 % organic matter. Although the soils were located only two kilometres apart, completely different herbicidal activity was observed. In the mineral soil, the organoclay formulation improved the behaviour of the herbicide and prevented its leaching; whereas in the peat-derived soil, the organoclay and commercial formulations behaved similarly, and were confined to the upper soil layer. In the latter case, the penetration depth of herbicide added in the organoclay formulation might be too shallow, resulting in poor herbicidal activity. The results of this study demonstrate differences that should be considered in weed control in drained peat soils.

AB Sufficiency of potassium (K) is one of the biggest concerns for forestry in boreal peatlands, since the rooting zone stores of K in thick peat soils are generally small and significant proportion of the K in ecosystem is bound in stand biomass. Increased demand for bioenergy may lead to intensified harvesting also in such forests. There is thus an urgent need to study the significance of the nutrients in harvest residues for the next-generation forest productivity. The specific questions in peatland forests are whether the harvest residues are an important source of K to the restock or whether the K in harvest residues is lost by leaching. We quantified K losses from drained peatland forests following management by clear-felling with stem-only harvesting (SOH), whole-tree harvesting (WTH) and whole-tree harvesting plus stump harvesting (WTHS). Calibration period-control area method and mixed modelling approach were used to analyze the ditch-outflow K-concentration and water-borne K-export data from 17 harvested and 5 control catchments in southern and central Finland. K concentrations and runoff were monitored for 1-2 years before and 3-4 years after treatment. Supplementary long-term data from one pair of harvested and non-managed catchments was used to assess the duration of the harvest impact on K export. Mean annual K concentrations in ditch outflow were higher after than before harvesting. The concentrations started to increase during the second or third post-harvest year, reaching the peaks of 1.1-2.2 mg L-1 in WTHS, 0.8-1.7 mg L-1 in WTH, and 1.0-1.9 mg L-1 in SOH. The concentrations correlated positively with the amount of K in the surface peat. In nutrient-poor ombrotrophic sites, the K concentrations were higher for sites with shallower water-table level. Using the supplementary data, the impact of harvesting on K losses was estimated to last for about eight years. The overall estimated K loss was about 28 kg ha(-1) from minerotrophic sites, and about 9 kg ha-1 from ombrotrophic sites. There was no significant difference in K losses between the harvest treatments SOH, WTH and WTHS, indicating that the K in harvest residues was largely retained onsite. The role of K losses induced by harvesting in the site K stores in drained peatland forests is discussed. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The vast undisturbed mires in western Siberia formed a significant sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide during the Holocene. However, the lack of spatially resolved simulation models hampers the quantification of Holocene carbon accumulation of the entire mire systems. Here we developed a three-dimensional dynamic model, based on a hydrological approach. We applied the model to a large mire complex in western Siberia to simulate its Holocene development and to quantify the long-term carbon accumulation rate (LORCA). Our model simulated a LORCA with a spatial variation of 10-85 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The average over the Holocene was 16.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Simulation scenarios for the 21st century show that the average LORCA dropped to 5.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1) because of oxidation and decomposition of peat following mire drainage after the 1950s. Even in the undrained parts of the mire complex the LORCA is lowered substantially because of the dropped water table and resulting decrease in peat growth. Our results show that carbon accumulation in western Siberian watershed mires will continue in the future. Thus these mires might remain a significant sink of carbon.

AB The aim of this paper was to evaluate the link between environmental conditions and the vegetation pattern of mountain peatlands drained for forestry. We assumed that (a) water chemistry and soil properties differ between the investigated peatlands types-from fen to bog, (b) the vegetation pattern is dependent on water chemistry and soil properties, and (c) water chemistry and soil properties play different roles in determining peatland patterning. For our study, five ecologically and topographically diverse forestry-drained shallow peatlands in Central Sudetes, Poland, were selected. A comparison between the studied peatlands and environmental variables was done by discriminant analysis, whereas vegetation-environmental relationship was analysed by canonical correspondence analysis. Results demonstrated that pH, HCO3-, NO3-, and Ca2+ best explained the variation in water chemistry (approximately 74%), whereas base saturation, pH(water), and plant-available phosphorus best explained the variation in soil properties. Plant assemblages within the peatlands exhibited three vegetation clusters that did not always correspond to peatland ecological type. The vegetation was mostly affected by water chemistry (explained up to 54% of variation), rather than by soil properties. Vegetation within such ecosystems seems to be a good indicator of differences in water chemistry, caused by differences in bedrock (soligenic fen peatlands) or atmospheric inputs (ombrogenic bogs). Our results will help improve our understanding of vegetation-environment relationships in degraded mountain peatland ecosystems in the temperate climate zone. They might also be useful for proper planning of restoration and monitoring of these ecosystems.

AB The physical and hydrological properties of peat from seven peatlands in northern Maputaland (South Africa) were investigated and related to the degradation processes of peatlands in different hydrogeomorphic settings. The selected peatlands are representative of typical hydrogeomorphic settings and different stages of human modification from natural to severely degraded. Nineteen transects (141 soil corings in total) were examined in order to describe peat properties typical of the distinct hydrogeomorphic settings. We studied degree of decomposition, organic matter content, bulk density, water retention, saturated hydraulic conductivity and hydrophobicity of the peats. From these properties we derived pore size distribution, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and maximum capillary rise. We found that, after drainage, degradation advances faster in peatlands containing wood peat than in peatlands containing radicell peat. Eucalyptus plantations in catchment areas are especially threatening to peatlands in seeps, interdune depressions and unchannelled valley bottoms. All peatlands and their recharge areas require wise management, especially valley-bottom peatlands with swamp forest vegetation. Blocking drainage ditches is indispensable as a first step towards achieving the restoration of drained peatland areas, and further measures may be necessary to enhance the distribution of water. The sensitive swamp forest ecosystems should be given conservation priority.

AB The Yorkshire Dales is one of the most iconic agricultural landscapes in Britain. However, many questions remain over the evolution of this landscape through time and its natural state before major human impacts. Here we present new palynological data that provide insight into the vegetation and fire history of the southern Yorkshire Dales from the late glacial period to present day. Our data suggest that there is considerable variation in vegetation history between sites, which probably reflects topographic and edaphic factors. Several of the records contain hiatuses that may reflect forest clearance, slow peat accumulation, or peat drainage, cutting and/or burning. Our data show a marked clearance of woodland beginning in the Neolithic period and intensifying in more recent times, marking the development of the contemporary agricultural landscape of the Yorkshire Dales.

AB Swiss Bogs of National Importance were designated as protected areas in 1991. However, their quality was found to have decreased over a 5-7 year monitoring period. In this article we assess the quality of the vegetation and its changes in 80 bogs throughout Switzerland. To determine change over time, 2912 pairs of records from revisited plots were compared. The indicator for quality was the ratio of specialists to the full species list in each record. We performed linear regressions to assess the proportion of variance explained by the variables: bog area, distance to edge, bog density, altitude and draining structures within the bog core areas and their surroundings. To specify the site conditions, we analysed Landolt's mean indicator values for light, humidity and nutrients. Finally, we derived a raw estimate of the loss in bog area. Distance to edge, bog density and draining structures outside the bogs had the best explanatory power for the quality of bog vegetation. The quality increased with distance from the edge. It correlated better with nutrients indicator values than with humidity values. With regard to quality changes, humidity indicator values decreased mainly in the bog centres, whereas increasing nutrients values and decreasing light values mainly affected the margins. We estimated that the loss of high quality surface affected about 0.6 % of the total Swiss bog area.

AB Peatlands have undergone dramatic changes through anthropogenic activities in the last centuries, causing a substantial loss of fen-specific biodiversity. Therefore, restoration of already degraded stands is an important conservation issue. The effectiveness of fen restoration was evaluated through rewetting in the valley of the river Peene, NE Germany, by comparing three fen types: drained fens, rewetted fens, and near-natural fens. Rove beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) were used as indicators, comprising an ecologically important yet understudied insect group. 5,398 individuals from 121 staphylinid species were recorded by 30 pitfall traps per fen type, which were biweekly emptied between April and October 2012, and related to environmental parameters. Rove beetle assemblages differed markedly between fen types. Community structure was affected by peat degradation, the extent of organic matter, water level, and vegetation height. Fen rewetting favoured the establishment of a distinct, species-rich beetle community within 15years only, caused by an increase in hygrophilous wetland species partially replacing generalists. Nevertheless, this time span was not sufficient to restore communities characteristic for near-natural fens, which harboured several particularly sensitive species that were not found on rewetted fens. Rewetting provided suitable habitats for a substantial number of stenotopic and threatened staphylinid beetles. Thus, the protection of pristine habitats along with restoration measures are both important strategies in peatland conservation.

AB Globally, peatlands have been affected by drainage and peat extraction, with adverse effects on their functioning and services. To restore peat-forming vegetation, drained bogs are being rewetted on a large scale. Although this practice results in higher groundwater levels, unfortunately it often creates deep lakes in parts where peat was extracted to greater depths than the surroundings. Revegetation of these deeper waters by peat mosses appears to be challenging due to strong abiotic feedbacks that keep these systems in an undesired bare state. In this study, we theoretically explore if a floating peat mat and an open human-made bog lake can be considered two alternative stable states using a simple model, and experimentally test in the field whether stable states are present, and whether a state shift can be accomplished using floating biodegradable structures that mimic buoyant peat. We transplanted two peat moss species into these structures (pioneer sp. Sphagnum cuspidatum and later-successional sp. S. palustre) with and without additional organic substrate. Our model suggests that these open human-made bog lakes and floating peat mats can indeed be regarded as alternative stable states. Natural recovery by spontaneous peat moss growth, i.e., a state shift from open water to floating mats, is only possible when the water table is sufficiently shallow to avoid light limitation (<0.29 m at our site). Our experiment revealed that alternative stable states are present and that the floating structures facilitated the growth of pioneer S. cuspidatum and vascular plants. Organic substrate addition particularly facilitated vascular plant growth, which correlated to higher moss height. The structures remained too wet for the late-successional species S. palustre. We conclude that open water and floating peat mats in human-made bog lakes can be considered two alternative stable states, and that temporary floating establishment structures can induce a state shift from the open water state to peat-forming vegetation state. These findings imply that for successful restoration, there is a clear water depth threshold to enable peat moss growth and there is no need for addition of large amounts of donor-peat substrate. Correct species selection for restoration is crucial for success.

ID PERMANENT SCATTERERS; SURFACE DEFORMATION; SUBSIDENCE; EMISSIONS
AB Temporal decorrelation is one of the main limitations of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry. For nonurban areas, its mechanism is very complex, as it is very dependent of vegetation types and their temporal dynamics, actual land use, soil types, and climatological circumstances. Yet, an a priori assessment and comprehension of the expected coherence levels of interferograms are required for designing new satellite missions (in terms of frequency, resolution, and repeat orbits), for choosing the optimal data sets for a specific application, and for feasibility studies for new interferometric applications. Although generic models for temporal decorrelation have been proposed, their parameters depend heavily on the land use in the area of interest. Here, we report the behavior of temporal decorrelation for a specific class of land use: pasture on drained peat soils. We use L-, C-, and X-band SAR observations from the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS), European Remote Sensing Satellite, Envisat, RADARSAT-2, and TerraSAR-X missions. We present a dedicated temporal decorrelation model using three parameters and demonstrate how coherent information can be retrieved as a function of frequency, repeat intervals, and coherence estimation window sizes. New satellites such as Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2, with shorter repeat intervals than their predecessors, would enhance the possibility to obtain a coherent signal over pasture.

AB Consecutive multiple disturbances to northern peatlands can dramatically impact peat hydrophysical properties. We examine the impact of a double disturbance (drainage and wildfire) on the hydrophysical and moisture retention properties of peat, a key regulator of peatland ecohydrological resilience, and compare this with the impact to each individual disturbance (drainage and wildfire). The compound effect of drainage and wildfire resulted in a shift of the surface datum down the peat profile, revealing denser peat. Less-dense near-surface peats that regulate water-table position and near-surface moisture content, both favourable to Sphagnum recolonization, were lost. At a drained peatland that was then subject to wildfire, peat bulk density increased by 14.1%, von Post humification class increased by two categories and water retention increased by 15.6%, compared with an adjacent burned but undrained (single disturbance) portion of the fen. We discuss the key hydrophysical metrics of peatland vulnerability and outline how they are affected by the isolated impacts of drainage and wildfire, as well as their combined effects. We demonstrate that multiple peatland disturbances have likely led to an increase in hydrological limitations to Sphagnum recovery, which may impact peatland ecohydrological resilience.

AB The climate conditions of the current and previous growing seasons have been shown to influence growth of coniferous trees in mineral soils sites. These dependencies may be different in peatlands where growth is generally more dependent on variations in soil water conditions. In the Nordic and Baltic countries, millions of hectares of peatlands and wetlands have been drained in order to enhance forest production. These drainage networks do not guarantee stable soil water conditions for the whole stand rotation. It is thus likely that precipitation in particular may have a different influence on annual growth in peatland to that in mineral soil sites. We studied the effect of precipitation and temperature on the inter-annual diameter growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Finland in drained peatland forests. The diameter growth data were limited to periods when growth response to drainage had levelled out. For comparison. growth data were also collected from adjacent mineral soil trees. The climate variables were monthly mean temperature and precipitation in a given location estimated from observations at the nearest weather stations by means of spatial smoothing. We used mixed linear models in describing the annual diameter growth of individual trees as a function of tree size and stand properties and expressed the residual variation as a function of climate parameters. The peatland and mineral soil growth variations showed different dependence on climate parameters. Peatland trees within 5 m of a ditch showed different climate responses compared to those located further away. Precipitation in July was negatively correlated with the diameter growth of peatland trees but there was no correlation with temperature. Growth of trees in mineral soils was positively correlated with March and April mean temperatures and May and June mean precipitation. The residual growth indices showed largely similar patterns in peatlands and mineral soil sites. (C) 2012 Istituto Italiano di Dendrocronologia. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB In the UK, the majority of peatlands have been damaged by drainage, agriculture, forestry plantations or erosion, compromising the ecosystem services they deliver including carbon sequestration. On the other hand, since the 1990s many projects have carried out a range of interventions to restore peatlands. In forest-to-bog restoration, tree removal and drain blocking lead to immediately visible changes. However, while some key plant species return within years, they may continue to exhibit differences in how they perform and interact with their environment. To investigate this, plant functional traits were measured and compared for Calluna vulgaris, Erica tetralix, Eriophorum angustifolium, Eriophorum vaginatum, Sphagnum capillifolium and Sphagnum papillosum collected in an open blanket bog, a forestry plantation and two forest-to-bog restoration sites in northern Scotland. Significantly lower specific leaf area and chlorophyll content, and higher leaf dry matter content, were found in the open bog site compared with plantation and forest-to-bog sites. This could be related to nutrient enrichment derived from brash and needle decomposition in the latter sites, suggesting a lasting effect of coniferous plantations even after decades of restoration management. Altered plant functional traits may have feedbacks on ecosystem processes such as litter decomposition and peat formation.

AB This article provides an overview of the effects of land-use on the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) and from peatlands in the Nordic countries based on the field data from about 100 studies. In addition, this review aims to identify the gaps in the present knowledge on the greenhouse gas (GHG) balances associated with the land-use of these northern ecosystems. Northern peatlands have accumulated, as peat, a vast amount of carbon from the atmosphere since the last glaciation. However, the past land-use and present climate have evidently changed their GHG balance. Unmanaged boreal peatlands may act as net sources or sinks for CO2 and CH4 depending on the weather conditions. Drainage for agriculture has turned peatlands to significant sources of GHGs (mainly N2O and CO2). Annual mean GHG balances including net CH4, N2O and CO2 emissions are 2260, 2280 and 3140 gCO(2) eq. m(-2) (calculated using 100 year time horizon) for areas drained for grass swards, cereals or those left fallow, respectively. Even after cessetion of the cultivation practices, N2O and CO2 emissions remain high. The mean net GHG emissions in abandoned and afforested agricultural peatlands have been 1580 and 500 gCO(2) eq. m(-2), respectively. Peat extraction sites are net sources of GHGs with an average emission rate of 770 gCO(2) eq. m(-2). Cultivation of a perennial grass (e. g., reed canary grass) on an abandoned peat extraction site has been shown to convert such a site into a net sink of GHGs (-330 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). In contrast, despite restoration, such sites are known to emit GHGs (mean source of 480 gCO(2) eq. m(-2), mostly from high CH4 emissions). Peatland forests, originally drained for forestry, may act as net sinks (mean -780 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). However, the studies where all three GHGs have been measured at an ecosystem level in the forested peatlands are lacking. The data for restored peatland forests (clear cut and rewetted) indicate that such sites are on average a net sink (190 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). The mean emissions from drained peatlands presented here do not include emissions from ditches which form a part of the drainage network and can contribute significantly to the total GHG budget. Peat soils submerged under water reservoirs have acted as sources of CO2, CH4 and N2O (mean annual emission 240 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). However, we cannot yet predict accurately the overall greenhouse gas fluxes of organic soils based on the site characteristics and land-use practices alone because the data on many land-use options and our understanding of the biogeochemical cycling associated with the gas fluxes are limited.

AB Shrub birch (Betula humilis Schrk.) is endangered glacial relict growing in natural and drained fens and transitional mires. At present study we examined karyotypes of 103 individuals of B. humilis, collected in six populations from eastern and northeastern Poland. We found 60% of diploid individuals with 2n = 28. The rest of studied plants were aneuploids with 26, 27, 29, 30 and 31 chromosomes in their karyotypes. High frequencies of aneuploids in Polish populations of B. humilis could be a consequence of: (i) hybridization with congeneric species, (ii) stress resulting from range fragmentation, (iii) karyotype instability of individuals with 2n not equal 28, or (iv) vegetative reproduction.

AB It is said that the forest industry is the backbone of the national economy in Finland. This was in particular the case in the twentieth century. That is also why the drainage of forests has played an important role in the national forestry policy. The most intensive period of forest drainage started at the beginning of the 1960s and lasted for 20 years. During that period the annual drained area was on average 200 000 ha. This article presents a short overview of the history of forest drainage in Finland in its heyday and also illustrates some current water conservation measures in the drainage of forested areas.

AB A field experiment was carried out to validate the results of a previous laboratory experiment showing that part of the carbon released from decaying Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needle and fine root litter was retained in the peat soil. C-14-labelled litter was incubated for up to 1.5 years in pristine and drained pear soils. During this period, 40-60% of the: initial C-14-activity was lost from the litter and 10-30% of the lost activity was retained in the soil. Needle litter decomposed faster than fine root litter. On average, drainage increased the mass and C-14 losses from the needle litter in Carex-peat but not in Sphagnum-peat. Losses from the fine root litter were not clearly affected by drainage. Drainage did not significantly affect the relative proportion of C-14-activity found in the peat. The results support the earlier hypothesis that a flow of organic C from decaying tree litter contributes to C storage in drained peatlands. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently there has been interest in the occurrence of bromide (Br-) in natural waters since it has been demonstrated that Br-, in association with humic substances in raw waters, is readily incorporated into haloacetic acids in the form of organically bound bromine (Br) during water chlorination. We report results of the effects of experimentally rewetting a naturally drained gully mire on the hydrochemistry of Br-, iron (Fe) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the pear water. Results obtained over a three year period showed that rewetting substantially increased the concentrations of these solutes in the pore water, with peal; values of 1 mg dm(-3) (Br-), > 60 mg dm(-3) (Fe) and > 300 mg dm(-3) (DOC) detected in some samples after rewetting. compared with typical values < 0.05 mg dm(-3) (Br-), < 1 mg dm(-3) (Fe) and < 15 mg dm(-3) (DOC) under the drained conditions. Bromide, Fe and DOC release were highly seasonal, with the largest concentrations observed in late-summer to autumn. However, whereas seasonal peak concentrations of Fe and DOC have since remained at these higher levels, seasonal peak concentrations of Br- were progressively attenuated over time, suggesting the latter phenomenon is a flush effect, with no longer-term consequences for water quality.

AB We investigated the responses of needle litter of tamarack (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch.) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) to fertilization of undrained and drained minerotrophic peatland sites, The drained site was ditched in the fall of 1987. Four N-P-K fertilization treatments (0-0-0, 0-80-120, 200-80-120, 400-80-120 kg ha(-1)), replicated three times on each site were applied at the end of May 1989, Needle litter was sampled on 17 September 1989 for black spruce and 30 September 1989 for tamarack. The needle litter P and K concentration and content of tamarack were increased by phosphorus/potassium fertilization, but were decreased by nitrogen fertilization. However, nitrogen fertilization increased needle N status of tamarack and black spruce, and unit needle mass of tamarack. Retranslocation of P and K was decreased by phosphorus/potassium fertilization, but was increased by nitrogen fertilization. Retranslocation of N decreased with nitrogen fertilization.

AB The temperature regime and the dependence of thermal diffusivity on the volumetric water content in high-ash drained peat soils (Sapric Drainic Histosols (Lignic)) on woody peat underlain by grass, sedge, and woody peat layer in the Yakhroma River valley (Moscow oblast) were studied in terrain and laboratory on undisturbed samples. In the laboratory, the dependences of thermal diffusivity were determined in the course of sample drying by the Kondrat'ev method (a steady-state radial heat flow); whereas the terrain dynamic data on the daily temperature variations were used to solve the inverse problem by the heat wave method. The dependences obtained by laboratory and field methods showed a dome-like shape, the maxima of which were close (at the volumetric water content equal to 57-60%), but the thermal diffusivity obtained from the terrain data was 1.2 times lower at the maximum point. Considering the further use of dependences in predictive mathematical models, approximation of the curves by the method of Chang and Horton made it possible to evaluate the accuracy of the approximation parameters and to compare them. According to the laboratory method, the approximation errors grew reliably with an increase in the measured thermal diffusivity, which points to a systematic error in the laboratory measurement of the latter as dependent on the water content; this effect was not registered in the field method. The systematic errors in laboratory studies must be associated with shrinkage and vapor transfer.

AB Soils have an important role in the global budgets of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). In particular, peat soils are considered to exhibit relatively high emission rates. The purpose of this study is to make an integrated assessment of the emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O from pasture on drained peat soils in the Netherlands (almost 10% of the total land area). The study is based on monitoring studies, described or to be described in more detail elsewhere, at the experimental farm 'R.O.C. Zegveld'. Besides emissions from the soil-plant part of the system, CO2 emission from cattle and their excreta, and emissions of CH4 and N2O from excreta in grazed pastures were included. The annual fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O were estimated. The estimated net CO2 emission was (11 +/- 3) x 10(3) kg/ha per year, CH4 emissions ranged from -0.3 +/- 0.1 to 0.1 +/- 0.1 kg/ha per year and N2O emissions from 14 +/- 1 to 61 +/- 4 kg/ha per year. By extrapolation we estimated the contribution of the investigated sources on drained pear pastures to the overall national greenhouse gas emission of 244 x 10(9) kg CO2 equivalents/year, assuming that (1) the emissions at the monitored site were representative for the Netherlands, and (2) the uncertainties found in the monitoring studies were the sole sources of uncertainty. The percentage contributions to the overall national greenhouse gas emission were estimated at 1.3 +/- 0.3% for CO2, 0.0% for CH4 and 0.9 +/- 0.1% for N2O. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Anthropogenic drainage of peatlands releases additional greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and dissolved carbon (C) and nutrients to downstream ecosystems. Rewetting drained peatlands offers a possibility to reduce nitrogen (N) and C losses. In this study, we investigate the impact of drainage and rewetting on the cycling of dissolved C and N as well as on dissolved gases, over a period of 1 year and a period of 4 months. We chose four sites within one Atlantic bog complex: a near-natural site, two drained grasslands with different mean groundwater levels and a former peat cutting area rewetted 10 years ago.
   Our results clearly indicate that long-term drainage has increased the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ammonium, nitrate and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) compared to the near-natural site. DON and ammonium contributed the most to the total dissolved nitrogen. Nitrate concentrations below the mean groundwater table were negligible. The concentrations of DOC and N species increased with drainage depth. In the deeply-drained grassland, with a mean annual water table of 45 cm below surface, DOC concentrations were twice as high as in the partially rewetted grassland with a mean annual water table of 28 cm below surface. The deeply drained grassland had some of the highestever observed DOC concentrations of 195.8 +/- 77.3 mg L-1 with maximum values of > 400 mg L-1. In general, dissolved organic matter (DOM) at the drained sites was enriched in aromatic moieties and showed a higher degradation status (lower DOC to DON ratio) compared to the near-natural site. At the drained sites, the C to N ratios of the uppermost peat layer were the same as of DOM in the peat profile. This suggests that the uppermost degraded peat layer is the main source of DOM. Nearly constant DOM quality through the profile furthermore indicated that DOM moving downwards through the drained sites remained largely biogeochemically unchanged. Unlike DOM concentration, DOM quality and dissolved N species distribution were similar in the two grasslands and thus unaffected by the drainage depth.
   Methane production during the winter months at the drained sites was limited to the subsoil, which was quasi-permanently water saturated. The recovery of the water table in the winter months led to the production of nitrous oxide around mean water table depth at the drained sites.
   The rewetted and the near-natural site had comparable DOM quantity and quality (DOC to DON ratio and aromaticity). 10 years after rewetting quasi-pristine biogeochemical conditions have been re-established under continuously water logged conditions in the former peat cut area. Only the elevated dissolved methane and ammonium concentrations reflected the former disturbance by drainage and peat extraction. Rewetting via polder technique seems to be an appropriate way to revitalize peatlands on longer timescales and to improve the water quality of downstream water bodies.

AB The Florida Everglades is a patterned peatland formed from sawgrass and other aquatic plant material that has accumulated over millennia. This peatland was initially drained in the late 1800s for agricultural and urban development and has been highly modified by the construction of canals and levees. Restoration plans include providing additional surface water flow which should help to prevent further peat loss by oxidation and encourage the accretion of peat that has been lost through drainage and peat fires. But how much peat has been lost? We know that about 50 % of the original surface area is gone; but what about the driver of ecological processes, the soil? Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, we compared predrainage and current peat volumes using historical and recent datasets, spatially-referenced soil bulk density values and carbon content to determine peat mass and carbon mass for each Everglades region. Given the uncertainties in the datasets, this analysis should be viewed as providing rough order-of-magnitude values. Our calculations indicate that the current Everglades contains less than 24 % of the original peat volume, 17 % of its mass and 19 % of its carbon.

AB In the UK, large areas of peatland were drained for forestry in the second half of the 20th century. Ground surface subsidence and diminishing depth (thickness) of the peat layer can indicate compaction of the peat and/or carbon loss, but there are few long-term datasets from afforested UK peatlands. Here we present an unprecedented 50-year time series of surface subsidence from Bad a'Cheo Forest (Caithness, Scotland). This site was initially surveyed for ground level and peat depth in 1966, prior to drainage and plantation, with repeat surveys roughly 20 and 30 years after drainage. We re-surveyed the site 50 years after initial drainage, producing a unique long-term time series to assess change since these historical studies. Significant subsidence has taken place since drainage, with an average reduction of 56.8 cm (or 13 %) in the depth of peat under forest stands. Subsidence of the peat surface was rapid in the initial phase after drainage and planting but has progressively slowed, with relatively little change between the surveys of 1996 and 2016. These results imply carbon loss but do not demonstrate it directly, as compaction of the peat is also probable. The subsidence data demonstrate that drainage followed by afforestation led to a considerable reduction in thickness of the peat layer and show how this evolved through time.

AB Soil mesofauna community structure was studied in a drainage-succession continuum of peatland sites supporting Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) dominated stands in southern Finland. The numbers of Enchytraeidae, Collembola, Oribatida, Mesostigmata and Prostigmata in an g-cm-deep surface peat layer were compared among a pristine undrained pine mire site, comparable sites drained for forestry 12, 26 and 60 years earlier, and a 42-year-old drained site re-wetted two years earlier. Drainage and the consequent water-level draw-down clearly increased the numbers of all soil animals studied, the numbers showing highly significant correlation with the water-table level of the sites. On the older drained sites, the populations were generally about ten times higher than on the undrained site; for Collembola, almost 100 times higher. After re-wetting, the numbers dropped abruptly, falling between those of the undrained and the youngest drained site. Oribatida were the most frequently found animals on the sites studied: on the undrained site almost 60% of the total number were these mites, the relative proportion somewhat decreasing along the drainage succession. The proportion of Enchytraeidae also decreased slightly after drainage, whereas that of Collembola clearly increased. Most of the soil fauna was found close to the soil surface. In general, >80% of Collembola, Oribatida, Mesostigmata and Prostigmata, and >60% of Enchytraeidae were found in the topmost 4-cm layer. In the course of the drainage succession, the soil fauna community structure became more similar to that of upland sites with similar tree-stand growth potential. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB We present the past 200 years palaeoecology of a peatland located in W Poland. This site is very important from the point of view of regional nature conservation. Plant macrofossils, testate amoebae, peat microtomography and radiocarbon dating were used in high-resolution to reconstruct the recent human impact on the peatland. In this study, we hypothesise that recent disturbance associated with peatland drainage and forest transformation has affected the development of the peatland and its trophic states. We sought to answer several questions. I) How pristine is the Rzecin peatland? II) Did the outbreak of Panolis flammea and the deforestation of 90% of the area of the Notec Forest affect the water table and the pH of the Rzecin peatland? III) Did the construction of the Rzecin Canal through the drainage of the peatland (in the 1880s and 1890s) strongly influence the changes in the ground water of the Rzecin peatland? Deforestation and the digging of the Rzecin drainage canal between AD 1880 and AD 1890 marked the beginning of major changes in the wetland ecosystem and caused habitat acidification. The next acidification event, connected with Sphagnum appearance, began ca AD 1990. Based on our quantitative reconstruction, the water table decreased during the years preceding P. flammea outbreak in AD 1923. Then, the water table increased after the outbreak correlated with the historical maps that show ephemeral lakes in the Notec Forest. The wetland examined by the current study was formerly perceived as highly natural, but its state is far from pristine, being very unstable during the last 200 years. Catastrophic events in the catchment change wetlands to a greater extent than we suppose, and their pristine state may not have existed for centuries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB Two different types of mire which had been subject to drainage for about 40 years before restoration of the water table have been studied. The abundance and distribution of testaceans were assessed in both mires before and after restoration. Human activities have changed the moisture conditions and surface chemistry of the mires. The occurrence of testate amoebae was related to the peat stratigraphy, plant remains and peat chemistry, and signs of the effects of these human activities were sought. Testacean shells were abundant throughout the full depth of peat studied in the ombrotrophic bog, but were numerous only in the surface peat of minerotrophic fen. Deeper layers of the fen had only small numbers of testate amoebae. Decomposition of organic material is generally greater at the fen site and has been accelerated during the drainage phase in the bog site, presumably with effects on the occurrence of testacean shells.
   Moisture conditions and peat composition were the main factors determining the occurrence of testaceans. In this study the pH of both mires was low and thus all the species were adapted to acidic conditions. Further, certain species showed correlation with mineral elements of the peat. The species that indicated dry conditions in the bog disappeared or their numbers decreased after the restoration. The effect of the moisture gradient was not as clear as before the restoration, and the testacean species seemed to be more dispersed according to the variation in mineral elements.

AB The relationship between water chemistry and vegetation was studied in a coastal ombrotrophic mire in northern Hokkaido, Japan. The distributions of Sphagnum and Phragmites communities were separated clearly by the pH and ion concentration of the peat surface-pore water. The drainage ditches along the road across the center of the mire had a high pH and ion concentration, as did the peat water in the western part of the mire. It was found that fields used for livestock farming on a hill to the west of the mire leached materials into the mire through drainage ditches, surface runoff, and probably also through ground water, and thus influenced the water chemistry of the mire. Management of the water, including that in the catchment of the mire, should be introduced before biological buffering capacity against excess nutrient loading caused by human activity is exceeded and the mire loses its ombrotrophic status.

Eight years after fertilization, however, the amount of micronutrients decreased compared to the amount of N and P in the litter. Fertilization on a fertile mire also increased the nutrient content of the litter fall, especially in the mature pine and birch stands. The amount of nutrients in the litter fall of the birch stands was considerably greater than that in the pine stand of the same volume.

AB The increasing use of wood and peat in energy production has created a potential to utilize wood and peat ashes as forest fertilizers on a wide scale. Previous studies have shown that tree growth in peatland benefits most from ash fertilization. However, possible harmful effects on recipient watercourses have prevented any larger-scale fertilization activity. The objective of this study was to examine the long-term changes in runoff acidity and the transport of nutrients, heavy metals and dissolved organic carbon via drainage water from drained boreal peatland catchments fertilized with wood or peat ash. The hypotheses were that the site's peat type, the origin and formula of the ash and the time of application have an influence on leaching amounts. Therefore, the studied catchments represented different peat (Carex or Sphagnum) and site types with different standing tree stocks (8-127 m(3) ha(-1)). Loose, self-hardened and drum-granulated ashes (wood and peat ashes) were used and applied (5000-6500 kg ha(-1)) either in winter on snow or in summer on bare ground. Water samples from the runoff were taken over a 10-11-year period following the applications. After 10-11 years from the treatments, the concentrations of S, K, Na, Cl-, and Mg in the runoff water were still higher at the wood ash treatments compared to the controls. Leaching of elements from peat ash was lower than from wood ash due to the lower content of elements. We estimated that 15-52% of the added S and 2-28% of the added K were leached from the wood and peat ashes during the study period. Leaching of S was the highest after the winter application and higher from the Sphagnum than from the Carex peat dominated catchments. The leaching of K was the highest after the summer application and was the lowest from the catchments having the highest tree stock. No increased leaching of P, N, dissolved organic carbon or heavy metals was detected. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Forest drainage has led to the loss of a considerable number of wetlands, especially in the northern hemisphere. In order to find ways to mitigate the loss of biodiversity in drained forests, we investigated two distinct conservation measures: (i) leaving drained peatlands for natural succession, i.e. protecting without active restoration, and (ii) constructing a variety of mitigation pools during ditch maintenance work in commercial forests. We tested the effectiveness of these conservation approaches for wetland biota, selecting brown frogs (Rana arvalis, R. temporaria) as our focal species. We found that ditches do not substitute natural floods as breeding habitats for brown frogs in protected peatlands. One of the main reasons was the reduction of sun exposure due to drainage induced forest growth. However, secondary wetlands formed on ditches impounded by Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) offered high quality reproduction sites for brown frogs. In commercial forests, the number of natural pools decreased due to ditch maintenance work, but the colonisation rate of brown frogs increased in cleaned ditches. The reproduction site selection of the two frog species differed R. arvalis bred mainly in natural and constructed pools, while R. temporaria bred more frequently in ditches. Among mitigation pools, those with a shallow littoral zone were primarily used for breeding. Thus, the conservation measures are effective only if certain key assumptions are met. The success could stand on the considering of the habitat requirements of target species before creating mitigation habitats or presence of a restoration agent (like beaver) in protected sites modified by human activities.

AB It is hypothesised that, since precipitation chemistry regulates the constitution of the base cations occupying the cation exchange sites of peat soils, and the latter in turn directly regulates the relative abundance of the corresponding base cations in drainage waters, the ratios of base cations in precipitation and drainage waters from peats should be very similar. The hypothesis is confirmed using data for 45 streams in western Scotland sampled under baseflow conditions, and for three streams in northeastern Scotland sampled along their length under baseflow conditions and also throughout a sequence of three successive storms. During the latter, as the soils became progressively wetter, and flow through or over surface organic horizons started to make an increasing relative contribution to total discharge, the difference between cation ratios in precipitation and river water was reduced. The effects of changing hydrological pathway in the three catchments were confirmed by changes in Al:Ca:Mg ratios between baseflow and storm water samples. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In boreal peatlands felling and tree harvest are commonly carried out as part of peatland restoration. Stem-only harvest is the principal harvest method and it leaves the live crown material (felling residue) containing most tree nutrients at the site. Whole-tree harvest, where felling residue is removed, is not favored due to higher transport costs, although it might better promote the recovery of nutrient-poor peatlands towards pristine conditions. We investigated whether initial differences in N mineralization and decomposition rates observed between tree harvest methods continued out to 6 years after restoration and whether the spatial variation in water table (WT) level and water nutrient concentrations parallels with the observed pattern in mineralization and decomposition rates. The study was done at 15 peatland sites in Natura 2000 protection areas in Finland during 2007-2013. Concentration of ammonium in soil water was higher in the stem-only harvest treatment compared to that of the whole-tree harvest treatment, whereas the previously observed differences in net N mineralization and decomposition rates had leveled out by the sixth year after restoration. The spatial variation created by the ditch network still affected the hydrology and peatland functions so that the nutrient concentrations were higher near ditches than in other locations, implying potential risk for nutrient leaching. Based on this study, there is no reason to prefer either harvest method over the other in nutrient-poor drained peatlands with low tree volumes, which constitute the majority of available peatland restoration area in Finland.

AB The understorey vegetation was compared and the short-term effects of fertilization studied on three drained peatland sites, one in eastern Finland, and the other two in southern Norway and Sweden. The original vegetation on all the sites was typical of ombrotrophic pine bogs. There were differences between the sites in species composition and abundance. The first dimension of detrended correspondence analysis was related to the depth of the groundwater table. It is likely that this factor will gradually lose its significance as the drainage improves on the Swedish and Norwegian sites. NPK and PK fertilization had some effects on the abundance and frequency of the plant species. The vigour of the field layer was positively affected on the Norwegian and Swedish sites. Eriophorum vaginatum and Rubus chamemorus most clearly benefitted from fertilization. In the bottom layer, Sphagnum species suffered on all three sites. Pleurozium schreberi on the Finnish site, as well as Aulacomnium palustre on the Norwegian site, increased their coverage after fertilization. Some new field layer species, e. g. Dryopteris spp., and Epilobium spp., became established during the course of the study in Finland and Sweden. Some new moss species, e. g. Plagiothecium in Finland, Mnium sp. in Sweden and Ptilidium sp. in Norway, were also found in the bottom layer, although they occurred only sporadically as new species. There were no clear differences between the effects of the individual fertilization treatments on the field layer, but the total coverage of the bottom layer decreased more after NPK than PK fertilization.

AB The distribution and quantitative recovery of N-15-labelled urea fertilizer was studied in a tamarack/black spruce ecosystem on a drained minerotrophic peatland in central Alberta, Canada. The site was ditched in Fall 1987 and urea fertilizer at 53 kg ha(-1) was applied on 1 June 1989. Recovery of labelled N 3 and 15 months after fertilization was determined in tree and understory vegetation biomass, and in soil. Fertilizer N showed little mobility in soil and tended to accumulate within the 0-20 cm depth. Mean fertilizer N recovery in soil at 3 and 15 months after fertilization was about 54 and 47%, respectively, of the applied N. Corresponding recovery in above tree components was 5.7 and 9.2%, respectively. This increase in recovery of fertilizer N in aboveground tree components was attributable to black spruce since N-15 recovered in black spruce increased significantly during the second growing season. In both years a greater proportion of N was recovered in black spruce compared with tamarack. A substantial amount of N was recovered in understory vegetation suggesting that understory may be a significant sink for N.

AB The aim of this study is to estimate wintertime emissions of greenhouse gases CO2, N2O and CH(4)in two abandoned peat extraction areas (APEA), Ess-soo and Laiuse, and in two Oxalis site-type drained peatland forests (DPF) on nitrogen-rich sapric histosol, a Norway spruce and a Downy birch forest, located in eastern Estonia. According to the long-term study using a closed chamber method, the APEAs emitted less CO(2)and N2O, and more CH(4)than the DPFs. Across the study sites, CO(2)flux correlated positively with soil, ground and air temperatures. Continuous snow depth > 5 cm did not influence CO2, but at no snow or a thin snow layer the fluxes varied on a large scale (from -1.1 to 106 mg C m(-2)h(-1)). In all sites, the highest N2O fluxes were observed at a water table depth of -30 to -40 cm. CH(4)was consumed in the DPFs and was always emitted from the APEAs, whereas the highest flux appeared at a water table >20 cm above the surface. Considering the global warming potential (GWP) of the greenhouse gas emissions from the DPFs in the wintertime, the flux of N2O was the main component of warming, showing 3-6 times higher radiative forcing values than that of CO(2)flux, while the role of CH(4)was unimportant. In the APEAs, CO(2)and CH(4)made up almost equal parts, whereas the impact of N2O on GWP was minor.

AB Understanding soil organic matter concentration (SOM) and chemistry in different peatlands can help design appropriate management practices for sustainable use of peatland agroecosystems. However, detailed information on characteristics of SOM concentration and chemistry is not available for most peatland agroecosystems in general and in northern Germany in particular. In this study, we investigated the SOM concentration and chemistry of drained and rewetted percolation mires, forest and coastal peatlands. We used simple chemical analysis, pyrolysis field ionization mass spectroscopy (Py-FIMS), and carbon and nitrogen X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The total organic carbon (C-org), total nitrogen (N), and total sulfur (S) contents were significantly (P < 0.05) different among the peatlands. The C-org at the surface horizons ranged from 164 to 373 g kg(-1), and these values were lower than that of the subsurface horizons of the studied peat lands except for the drained alder carr forest and coastal peatlands. The Py-FIMS indicated that the labile SOM compound classes (carbohydrates, phenols, and lignin monomers, and amino acids, peptides, and amino-sugars) and stable SOM compounds classes (lignin dimers, heterocyclic nitrogen compounds, and nitriles) were abundant at the surface horizons. However, the stable compound classes such as lipids, alkanes, alkenes, fatty acids, n-alkyl esters, and suberin were more abundant at the subsurface horizons than the surface horizons. The carbon K-edge spectra revealed that aromatic C, carboxylic C, O-alkyl, and aliphatic C were the predominant C functional groups, whereas N K edge spectra indicated that the amide group was the predominated N functional group. The SOM concentrations and some compound classes were higher in the rewetted sites of alder carr forest peatland (more carbohydrates, suberin and fatty acids) and of percolation mires (more lignin dimers, lipids and alkylaromatics). The results indicate that the effects of rewetting peatlands on SOM concentration and chemistry depend on peatland type.

AB Annual mobilization of soil nitrogen in peal soils varies from 60-120 to 300-350 kg/ha. The need in nitric fertilizers varies from very high to low when compared with the need in and potassium fertilizers. In some cases, the lowest rates of nitrogen are required, During the initial stages of cultivation and agricultural development of peat soils, the reserves of soil nitrogen may play the main role in nutrition of plants. After 35-50 years of cultivation, natural reserves of nitrogen in peat soils decrease significantly, acid the role of nitric fertilizers increases. At present, there is a great need in nitric fertilizers, and it will increase in the future.

AB The inherent structural dynamics of drained peatland forests may result in a great variation in various wood and fiber properties. We examined variation in fiber and pulp properties i) among stands, ii) among trees within stands, and iii) within trees in young stands dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). The stands, selected to cover a maximal range of the potential variation, were all at a stage of development where the first commercial thinnings would be feasible. Differences in the processability of the thinning removals were small. In similar kraft cooking conditions, a 5-unit variation in the kappa number of unbleached pulp was observed among the stands. Stand origin had no effect on pulp bleaching. The wood formed prior to drainage had a higher density, shorter fibers, was slightly slower delignified by cooking, and its yield was slightly lower than that of post-drainage wood. These properties, except for high density, are typical for juvenile wood in general, and at stand level they did not correlate with the proportion of pre-drainage wood. When the variation in fiber and pulp properties was broken down into its components, most of it was derived from tree-level in all the cases. On average, the fiber and pulp properties did not differ from those observed for first-thinning pulpwood from upland sites. Consequently, peatland-grown pulpwood may be mixed with other pulpwood in industrial processes. It would probably be best suited as the raw material for pulps with high bonding requirements, e.g. in the top ply of multi-ply board grades or in some specialty grades.

AB QuestionRe-wetting drained peatlands is a common restoration method to reduce carbon loss, but little is known on its likely consequences on reproductive plant development, especially in a warming world. Thus, the aim of this study was to test whether the phenological development of plant species in a peatland ecosystem changed with higher temperatures, increased water table level or a combination of the two.
   LocationFen peatland site in Bavaria, Germany.
   MethodsIn 2010, manipulative experiments with two different treatments (control and warming) and in 2011 with four different treatments (control, warming, increased water table level, warming + increased water table level) were conducted. Temperature was raised 0.4-1.5 degrees C with open-top chambers (OTCs) from August 2009 onwards, and water table level was elevated 12cm using a pumping system, however the latter was not continuous for the whole growing season of 2011 due to technical difficulties. Phenological development of different grassland species was observed weekly using the BBCH code. Attention focused on reproductive phenology (from flower development to fruit senescence) and on key single phenological phases, such as flower development, flowering, ripening and fruit senescence, as well as the duration of key phases. Additionally, vegetation height was measured.
   ResultsOur study showed that higher temperatures advanced reproductive phenology and most key phases, except fruit senescence. Water table manipulations had no significant influence on phenology. The duration of key phases was generally not significantly influenced by treatments, whereas vegetation height differed between control and higher temperature plots.
   ConclusionIn general, raising the water table to reduce carbon release from drained peatland sites will not dramatically affect phenological development of grassland species, whereas increased temperatures will affect reproductive phenology.

AB Urban and industrial developments were the reason for draining peatlands in the past which caused changes in their ecology. Restoration of the water regime aims to bring back their original functions. This study examines the natural recovery of peatland following re-wetting, blocking the drainage ditches. We used soil microbial activity, physicochemical properties and nematode communities as indicator taxa to describe restoration status five years after management. Data were compared to those obtained from adjacent degraded forest and meadow like habitats of former peatlands. Our results indicate that re-wetting had considerable effect to soil indices and nematodes. Soil moisture and organic carbon significantly increased, while pH has not changed. In contrast, soil enzymatic activity significantly decreased after re-wetting in the restored part of the peatland compared to the degraded habitats. These conditions were probably less favourable for small metazoans, because of their abundance; species number and diversity were significantly decreased after re-wetting management. The nematode trophic structure was also significantly degraded; the restored part of peatland had less omnivore and predators as well as plant parasites. We conclude that in respect to both biological indicators and basic soil properties analysed, blocking of drainage ditches creates capable conditions for natural peatland restoration.

AB A thinning and fertilization experiment was established in 1987 in a 50- to 60-year-old black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) stand growing on a shallow, boreal (central Alberta), minerotrophic peatland drained in 1986.  The experiment was a split-split plot design with thinning as the main factor, fertilization as the subfactor, and distance from drainage ditch as the subfactor.  Current and 1-year-old foliage, collected during late August 1988, was analyzed for mass and N, P, and K.  Black spruce responded to thinning, fertilization, and distance from a drainage ditch.  Thinning alone increased foliar N and P concentration and unit needle mass by 12, 30, and 16%, and foliar N and P content by 30 and 41%, respectively.  The relative increases in foliar mass and N concentration and content of current needles in N, NP, or NPK treated plots were generally higher in unthinned subplots and distant subsubplots than in thinned subplots and proximate subplots, suggesting that N was more limiting in unthinned plots and distant subsubplots.  Although the addition of P and K alone or in combination elevated foliar P and K concentrations and contents, there were no concomitant significant changes in unit needle mass, suggesting that P and K were not limiting.

AB Land-use changes have contributed to increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Conversion from natural peatlands to agricultural land has led to widespread subsidence of the peat surface caused by soil compaction and mineralization. To study the net ecosystem exchange of carbon (C) and the contribution of respiration to peat subsidence, eddy covariance measurements were made over pasture on a well-developed, drained peat soil from 22 May 2002 to 21 May 2003. The depth to the water table fluctuated between 0.02 m in winter 2002 to 0.75 m during late summer and early autumn 2003. Peat soil moisture content varied between 0.6 and 0.7 m(3) m(-3) until the water table dropped below 0.5 m, when moisture content reached 0.38 m(3) m(-3). Neither depth to water table nor soil moisture was found to have an effect on the rate of night-time respiration (ranging from 0.4-8.0 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in winter and summer, respectively). Most of the variance in night-time respiration was explained by changes in the 0.1 m soil temperature (r(2)=0.93). The highest values for daytime net ecosystem exchange were measured in September 2002, with a maximum of -17.2 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Grazing events and soil moisture deficiencies during a short period in summer reduced net CO2 exchange. To establish an annual C balance for this ecosystem, non-linear regression was used to model missing data. Annually integrated (CO2) C exchange for this peat-pasture ecosystem was 45 +/- 500 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). After including other C exchanges (methane emissions from cows and production of milk), the net annual C loss was 1061 +/- 500 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1).

AB The aim of this work was to study the short-term effect of clear-cut harvest on concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), B, Al, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Cd and Pb in drainage water from northern peatland catchments in Finland underlain by granitic or black shale bedrock, the latter having higher concentrations of several trace elements, such as Ni and Zn. Stem-only harvest (SOH) or whole-tree harvest (WTH) with stump removal were carried out at coniferous sites. Controls were left unharvested. DOC and trace element concentrations were monitored during one pre-treatment and two post-treatment years. There was no constant increase in the element concentrations. However, there were signs that both SOH and WTH clear-cut harvest on northern peatland catchments increases the concentrations of DOC, B, Al, Zn and Ni in ditchwater in some sites irrespective of the bedrock type. The greatest increases were observed in WTH sites but the study does not allow us to assess the statistical significance of the magnitude of the difference between SOH and WTH. We conclude that the element concentrations in ditchwater depend largely on site characteristics masking the possible effect of harvest.

AB Increasing and more intensive energy wood harvesting from forests necessitate efforts to ensure that adequate amounts of nutrients are recycled back onto the site. Recycling nutrients back to the forest in the form of wood ash is a natural means to correct the nutrient imbalance and acidity of forest soils that can occur from intensive management, as well as to solve the problem of disposing of wood combustion wastes. Methods of refining and spreading have been developed to improve the logistics and cost competitiveness of recycling wood ash back into the forest as fertilizer. In this study, the costs of spreading granulated wood ash in the forest were calculated under Finnish conditions. The profitability of recycling wood ash to drained peatland forests as a fertilizer was also analyzed, from the forest owner's point of view. For this analysis, wood ash was compared with chemical fertilizer in terms of effect, cost and profitability. Wood ash fertilization using the ground-based forwarder system was two to three times cheaper than using the aerial helicopter-loader system. From the forest owner's point of view, the fertilization of peatland forest with wood ash proved to be a very profitable silvicultural investment (IRR 3-12 percent). To improve the economics of wood ash recycling to forests, ground-based spreading of granulated ash should be emphasized. Furthermore, in order to create large enough operational units for the cost-efficient spreading of ash, there needs to be comprehensive planning of spreading sites. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Browning of surface waters, as a result of increasing dissolved organic carbon and iron concentrations, is a widespread phenomenon with implications to the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems. In this article, we provide an overview of the consequences of browning in relation to ecosystem services, outline what the underlying drivers and mechanisms of browning are, and specifically focus on exploring potential mitigation measures to locally counteract browning. These topical concepts are discussed with a focus on Scandinavia, but are of relevance also to other regions. Browning is of environmental concern as it leads to, e.g., increasing costs and risks for drinking water production, and reduced fish production in lakes by limiting light penetration. While climate change, recovery from acidification, and land-use change are all likely factors contributing to the observed browning, managing the land use in the hydrologically connected parts of the landscape may be the most feasible way to counteract browning of natural waters.

AB Extensive areas of European peatlands have been drained by digging ditches in an attempt to improve the land, resulting in increased carbon dioxide fluxes to the atmosphere and enhanced fluvial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Numerous peatland restoration projects have been initiated which aim to raise water tables by ditch blocking, thus reversing drainage-induced carbon losses. It has been suggested that extracellular hydrolase and phenol oxidase enzymes are partly responsible for controlling peatland carbon dynamics and that these enzymes are affected by environmental change. The aim of this study was to investigate how drainage and ditch blocking affect enzyme activities and water chemistry in a Welsh blanket bog, and to study the relationship between enzyme activity and water chemistry. A comparison of a drained and undrained site showed that the drained site had higher phenol oxidase and hydrolase activities, and lower concentrations of phenolic compounds which inhibit hydrolase enzymes. Ditch blocking had little impact upon enzyme activities; although hydrolase activities were lowered 4-9months after restoration, the only significant difference was for arylsulphatase. Finally, we noted a negative correlation between -glucosidase activity and DOC concentrations, and a positive correlation between arylsulphatase activity and sulphate concentration. Phenol oxidase activity was negatively correlated with DOC concentrations in pore water, but for ditch water phenol oxidase correlated negatively with the ratio of phenolics to DOC. Our results imply that drainage could exacerbate gaseous and fluvial carbon losses and that peatland restoration may not reverse the effects, at least in the short term.

AB 1. The effect of water level drawdown after drainage of mires for forestry was studied by comparing the vegetation on undrained pine-mire sites with that of sites drained 3-55 years earlier. The plant communities were analysed with respect to the following environmental variables: drainage age, total nutrient contents of surface pear, and tree stand characteristics. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to relate the environmental variables to data on the botanical composition of vegetation.
   2. Two main gradients were found in the data. The first ordination axis clearly relates to a gradient in forest vegetation succession and the second axis to a gradient in peat nutrient level and pH.
   3. The secondary succession towards forest vegetation started soon after drainage and proceeded most rapidly in the most nutrient-rich site types. This led to a more uniform vegetation composition between the site types.
   4. Original mire species reacted differently to the changing post-drainage environment. Tall sedges (Carex lasiocarpa, C. rostrata) disappeared soon after drainage. The coverages of the mire dwarf shrubs gradually decreased with increasing tree stand volumes; Betula nana appears to have been the most sensitive species. The coverages of the Sphagna studied appear to have decreased in response to increasing tree stand shading in the order: S. fuscum > S. recurvum complex > S. magellanicum > S. russowii.
   5. The development towards forest vegetation on mires may diminish the regional (gamma-) diversity on forest-dominated landscapes, even if the species (alpha-) diversity on individual sites is little affected.
   6. Long-term vegetation changes after artificial water level drawdown, emphasized in this study, can be used to mimic the effects of the predicted global climatic warming on mire vegetation.

   NITROGEN; WILDFIRE; BIOMASS
AB The management of artificially drained organic soils is a very important issue, since the accelerated mineralization and sometimes peat fires alter physical and chemical properties of soils and the availability of plant nutrients. This study was performed to determine relatively short- and long-term effects of peat fires on some physical and chemical properties of soils in the artificially drained Gavur Lake Peatland of Turkey. To achieve this objective, measured properties of soils burned in 2001, burned in 1965, and unburned were compared. The results indicated that soil bulk density, pH, amounts of soluble salts, CaCO3, and concentrations of ammonium acetate-extractable (AAE) Ca, Mg, K, and Na were significantly higher for both sampling depths in the burned areas. The areas burned in 2001 had higher pH, soluble salts, and the concentrations of AAE Ca, Mg, and K compared with sites burned in 1965, and this was reasoned with leaching losses and plant uptake of these basic cations for four decades in the latter. Percent saturation and organic carbon contents of soils, however, were significantly lower in the burned areas for both sampling depths. Olsen P levels were not significantly different between the sites. This work clearly shows that alterations in soils properties with peat fires do not recover in the long term.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in rivers contains a wide range of molecules that can be assimilated by microbes. However, there is today no integrated understanding of how the source and composition of this DOC regulate the extent to which the DOC can support microbial growth and respiration. We analyzed patterns in microbial metabolism of DOC from different streams and rivers in Quebec, by combining short-term bacterial production and respiration measurements with long-term DOC loss and analyses of bacterial use of different single substrates. We show that distinct metabolic patterns indeed exist across catchments, reflecting the varying nature and sources of the DOC. For example, DOC from forest headwaters systematically supported the highest bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) that was recorded, while in contrast DOC in peat bog drainage was used with significantly lower BGE. The carbon consumption in clear mountain rivers, possibly represented by autochthonous algal DOC, supported the highest bacterial respiration rates and the highest long-term DOC losses. By using principle component analysis, we demonstrate how the major axes of variation in all of the measured metabolic responses are tightly connected to spectrofluorometrical DOC composition indicators and to isotopic indicators of DOC source. If causality is assumed, our results imply that changes in DOC supply from different sources, for example, caused by land use or climate change, should result in dramatic changes in the patterns of aquatic microbial metabolism and thus in altered aquatic ecosystem functioning, with likely consequences for food-web structures and greenhouse gas balances.

DE CARBON DIOXIDE; METHANE; NITROUS OXIDE; CLIMATIC CHANGE; PEATLANDS
AB The emission of three trace gases, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide; and methane, from peatlands is examined, identifying the primary controls and the potential effect of climatic change on emission rates. Nitrous oxide emission from natural peatlands is small and tied to the cycling of nitrogen but increases upon disturbance such as drainage. Peatlands generally act as a sink for carbon dioxide, but they convert from a sink to a source upon drainage. Methane emissions are controlled primarily by position of the water table, with secondary controls of temperature and trophic status of the peat. Canadian and other northern peatlands play a moderately important role in the global methane budget. Climatic change, such as increases in temperature and precipitation predicted by 2 x CO2 scenarios, may result in increased emissions of nitrous oxide, decreased carbon dioxide storage, and reduced methane emissions from Canadian peatlands.

   JORDAN RIVER; WATER REUSE
AB Waters of the northern watershed of Lake Kinneret, sampled during the period 1985-1987, were analysed for their acid extractable and filterable major and trace element contents as part of an on-going research project. Water exploitation and reuse, mainly in the Hula Basin, resulted in an increase in concentration of trace elements in the different drainage canals. The distribution of high, exceptional values appears to be random, and cannot        be clearly related to time-environmental processes. The highest concentrations of some major and trace elements were consistently recorded in the canal that drains peat soils. Nevertheless, the southern reaches of the Northern Jordan River were only slightly higher in concentration than the pristine sources. This implies that parts of the metal load were eliminated by poorly defined processes. The acid extractable concentrations were usually twice those of the filterable fraction, with the exception of interrelated Fe and Al, which were highly enriched in the suspended phase. The low levels of the element contents in the highly dynamic system prohibited the proposal of a model explaining the observed variations. The trace metal concentrations, generally below the regulation values, were similar to those reported for unpolluted world-wide streams.

AB As a contribution to improving understanding of the mechanisms and relationships that exist within shallow peatland ecosystems, we report the results of monitoring five-years' recovery after restoration of a forestry-drained sloping rich fen site in the Central Sudetes in south-west Poland. Over the last 100 years, drainage ditches installed for forestry management purposes have affected the hydrology, soil and vegetation of this site. Spruce stands were present until 2010, when restoration started with blocking of ditches and clearcutting/removal of trees. The main objective of our study was to determine the effects of these restoration activities on aspects of hydrology and soil condition. We hypothesised that the five years following restoration could provide sufficient time to improve: 1) water table level and water quality, and 2) the physical and chemical properties of the organic soil. Restoration had a positive effect on water table level as early as two years after implementation of drain blocking and reduction of tree cover. However, five years was not sufficient time to reverse the decline in water quality. The concentrations of labile carbon forms in water, as well as water colour (Abs(400)), were similar in 2010 and 2015. Due to peatland rewetting and peat swelling a decrease in peat bulk density was observed. However, this outcome was identified only in the bottom organic soil horizons. This, in turn, affected the thickness of the peat layer and the altitude of the soil surface. Five years of recovery is insufficient to stop the mineralisation of organic matter, as indicated by lower TOC/TN values, slightly higher concentrations of labile forms of carbon, and the W-1 index of secondary transformation.

AB The aim of this study is to estimate emissions of greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O, and the effects of drainage and peat extraction on these processes, in Estonian transitional fens and ombrotrophic bogs. Closed-chamber-based sampling lasted from January to December 2009 in nine peatlands in Estonia, covering areas with different land-use practices: natural (four study sites), drained (six sites), abandoned peat mining (five sites) and active peat mining areas (five sites). Median values of soil CO2 efflux were 1,509, 1,921, 2,845 and 1,741 kg CO2-C ha(-1) year(-1) from natural, drained, abandoned and active mining areas, respectively. Emission of CH4-C (median values) was 85.2, 23.7, 0.07 and 0.12 kg ha(-1) year(-1), and N2O-N -0.05, -0.01, 0.18 and 0.19 kg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. There were significantly higher emissions of CO2 and N2O from abandoned and active peat mining areas, whereas CH4 emissions were significantly higher in natural and drained areas. Significant Spearman rank correlation was found between soil temperature and CO2 flux at all sites, and CH4 flux with high water level at natural and drained areas. Significant increase in CH4 flux was detected for groundwater levels above 30 cm.

AB Peatlands represent a vast store of global carbon(1). Observations of rapidly rising dissolved organic carbon concentrations in rivers draining peatlands have created concerns that those stores are beginning to destabilize(2,3). Three main factors have been put forward as potential causal mechanisms, but it appears that two alternatives-warming(2,4) and increased river discharge(3)-cannot offer satisfactory explanations(5). Here we show that the third proposed mechanism, namely shifting trends in the proportion of annual rainfall arriving in summer(6), is similarly unable to account for the trend. Instead we infer that a previously unrecognized mechanism-carbon dioxide mediated stimulation of primary productivity-is responsible. Under elevated carbon dioxide levels, the proportion of dissolved organic carbon derived from recently assimilated carbon dioxide was ten times higher than that of the control cases. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon appear far more sensitive to environmental drivers that affect net primary productivity than those affecting decomposition alone.

AB Sphagnum farming provides a sustainable wet land use alternative for drained peatland agriculture. Since 2011 Sphagnum has been cultivated on formerly drained bog grassland at Hankhauser Moor in north-west Germany. The site has been rewetted and is equipped with an automatic irrigation system which controls the inflow and outflow of water. We used measurements and models to determine the amount of irrigation water needed to keep the water table just below the Sphagnum surface throughout the year. In winter there was a water surplus, whereas in spring and summer evapotranspiration exceeded precipitation, creating a water deficit. Next to evapotranspiration, horizontal seepage was a major cause of water loss. Modelling indicated that the amount of irrigation required to make up the water deficit in the dry hydrological year 2013 (November 2012 to October 2013) amounted to 359 mm (3,588 m(3) ha(-1)). To compensate for the average water deficit over the 20year period 1993-2013, 160 mm of water would be needed annually (i.e. 1,600 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1)), but the maximum water deficit accumulated during that period was much higher, at 6,363 m(3) ha(-1). In relative terms, both evapotranspiration and seepage losses will decrease with increasing size of the rewetted area because drained surroundings enhance water losses from the wetter Sphagnum farming site, both as evapotranspiration due to advection (oasis effect) and as horizontal seepage due to steepening of hydraulic gradients. For successful Sphagnum farming the water demand must be considered and an appropriate water supply must be guaranteed.

AB Question: Does blocking of moorland drains increase bog vegetation on blanket peat?
   Location: Two sites with blocked drains and two with unblocked drains on Forsinard Flows National Nature Reserve, Sutherland, UK.
   Methods: Vegetation cover was recorded from 70 locations, with 12 sampling points at different distances (0.5-14.5 m) from moorland drains in each location. Gradients in the cover of species indicative of wet and dry conditions, as well as bog recovery and degradation in relation to distance from drain, were compared from a sample of drains at two sites with blocked drains and two with unblocked drains.
   Results: There was evidence for drain-blocking having a negative effect on vegetation indicative of drier conditions and bog degradation. One of the blocked sites had the lowest values of these indices near to the drain and increasing at greater distances perpendicular from the drain. The two unblocked sites, and the other blocked site, had a contrasting pattern of highest values of these indices close to the drain declining with distance. Cover of species indicative of bog recovery was greater where the drains had been blocked for the longest time.
   Conclusions: In some cases drain-blocking can improve the ecological functioning of blanket bogs by increasing cover of healthy bog vegetation. Further studies into the causes of such variability in restoring vegetation through drain-blocking are needed to aid targeting of peatland restoration projects to areas or methods most likely to be effective.

AB High water tables (WT) stabilise peatland carbon (C) through regulation of biogeochemical processes. The impact of peatland WT on ecosystem function, including C exchange, alters over time, and the factors that cause some peatlands to display resilience and others to undergo degradation are poorly understood. Here we use CO2 flux measurements, measured by eddy covariance, to compare ecosystem function between two raised bogs; one drainage-affected, with a deep and fluctuating water table and the other near-natural, with a shallow and stable water table. The drainage-affected bog was found to be a moderate sink for CO2 (69 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), which was 134 g C m(-2) yr(-1) less than the near-natural bog (203 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Greater ecosystem productivity has allowed the drainage-impacted bog to act as a CO2 sink despite higher ecosystem respiration; most likely due to an increase in photosynthetic capacity caused by expansion of ericaceous shrub cover. The tolerance of the vegetation community, particularly the main peat former Empodisma robustum (Restionaceae), to low and fluctuating WT appears to have been key in allowing the site to remain a sink. Despite the current resilience of the ecosystem CO2 sink, we found gross primary production to be limited under both high and low water tables, even in a year with typical rainfall. This is best explained by the limited physiological ability of ericaceous shrubs to tolerate a fluctuating WT. As such we hypothesise that if the WT continues to drop and become even more unstable, then without further vegetation change, a reduction in gross primary production is likely which may in turn cause the site to become a source for CO2.

AB Peatland soils play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle due to their high organic carbon content. Lowering of the water table e.g. for agricultural use accelerates aerobic secondary peat decomposition and processes of earthification. Peatlands change from C sinks to C sources. We characterized soil organic matter (SOM) with special attention to human impact through drainage. Our aim was to gain knowledge of SOM quality and soil-forming processes in drained fen soils in northeastern Germany.
   Through techniques of representative landscape analysis, we identified two typical and representative sampling sites in different stages of land use, representing the most important hydrogenetic mire types in northeastern Germany. We adapted chemical fractionation procedures which include hot water extraction (C-hwe and N-hwe) for determination of the labile fraction. Furthermore, a stepwise acid hydrolysis procedure was performed to measure the chemical recalcitrant part of SOM as it is more resistant to biodegradability.
   Total organic C decreased with increasing human impact and intensity of drainage. Conversely, C-hwe and N-hwe concentrations increased with increasing drainage and human impact. In contrast, the more recalcitrant fractions increased with soil depth.
   Generally, there is a lack of existing data about SOM quality and the factors controlling its stability and decomposition in fen soils. For northeastern German fen soils, the data are even more inadequate. Influence of drainage seems to overlap natural influences of site on SOM quality. The used extraction scheme was suitable for the chemical fractionation of SOM into labile and more recalcitrant parts.

AB The restoration of drained peat bogs in Northwest (NW) Europe is an important task of soil protection, but needs to cope with warmer and drier summers. Our examination took place in the Pietzmoor bog (Schneverdingen, NW Germany) that had been drained for fuel peat extraction until the 1970s and rewetted since then. We determined carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux in situ and in laboratory incubations. Also, we analyzed pore water for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total and dissolved organic N (DON), nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium, (NH4+) concentration. In Schneverdingen, the summer 2003 was record-breaking hot (mean temperature June to August elevated > 3 K compared to long-term average) and dry (precipitation during the same period < 59% of long-term average). In July 2003, the water table in the Pietzmoor subsided to > 42 cm below the surface in July 2003,when in Situ Soil CO2 efflux was up to 23.4 g m(-2) d(-1) compared to 15.7 g m(-2) d(-1) in September. Prior to March 2003, DOC concentrations in pore water were < 180,mg l(-1) and NH4+ was the dominant fraction of mineral N. In July 2003, DOC concentration rose to 249 g l(-1), DON concentrations. more than doubled, and NO3- became the dominant fraction of mineral N. Due to the increased future likelihood of,hot and dry summers in NW Germany, peat bog restoration efforts need take care that a water table close to the surface is maintained.

AB The abundance of the main microfloral groups, and dehydrogenase and urease activity, in the casts of Lumbricus rubellus Hoffm. and in the 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm soil layers of drained peaty meadows were compared. The abundance of microorganisms in casts was significantly higher than in the soil, as was the level of enzyme activity. The difference was particularly marked in comparisons with the 5-10 cm soil layer. In the cases of fungi, bacteria and actinomycetes, the degree to which abundance was greater in casts was highest at sites where the abundance of microflora in the soil was low. The activity of the two enzymes was always higher in casts than in soil, and the difference was especially marked for the meadow on alder peat.

AB Drainage of peatlands causes severe environmental damage, including high greenhouse gas emissions. Peatland rewetting substantially lowers these emissions. After rewetting, paludiculture (i.e. agriculture and forestry on wet peatlands) is a promising land use option. In Northeast Germany (291,361 ha of peatland) a multi-stakeholder discussion process about the implementation of paludiculture took place in 2016/2017. Currently, 57% of the peatland area is used for agriculture (7% as arable land, 50% as permanent grassland), causing greenhouse gas emissions of 4.5 Mt CO(2)eq a(-1). By rewetting and implementing paludiculture, up to 3 Mt CO(2)eq a(-1)from peat soils could be avoided. To safeguard interests of both nature conservation and agriculture, the different types of paludiculture were grouped into 'cropping paludiculture' and 'permanent grassland paludiculture'. Based on land legislation and plans, a paludiculture land classification was developed. On 52% (85,468 ha) of the agriculturally used peatlands any type of paludiculture may be implemented. On 30% (49,929 ha), both cropping and permanent grassland paludiculture types are possible depending on administrative check. On 17% (28,827 ha), nature conservation restrictions allow only permanent grassland paludiculture. We recommend using this planning approach in all regions with high greenhouse gas emissions from drained peatlands to avoid land use conflicts.

AB Fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHG) carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured during a two month campaign at a drained peatland forest in Finland by the eddy covariance (EC) technique (CO2 and N2O), and automatic and manual chambers (CO2, CH4 and N2O). In addition, GHG concentrations and soil parameters (mineral nitrogen, temperature, moisture content) in the peat profile were measured. The aim of the measurement campaign was to quantify the GHG fluxes during freezing and thawing of the top-soil, a time period with potentially high GHG fluxes, and to compare different flux measurement methods. The forest was a net CO2 sink during the two months and the fluxes of CO2 dominated the GHG exchange. The peat soil was a small sink of atmospheric CH4 and a small source of N2O. Both CH4 oxidation and N2O production took place in the top-soil whereas CH4 was produced in the deeper layers of the peat, which were unfrozen throughout the measurement period. During the frost-thaw events of the litter layer distinct peaks in CO2 and N2O emissions were observed. The CO2 peak followed tightly the increase in soil temperature, whereas the N2O peak occurred with a delay after the thawing of the litter layer. CH4 fluxes did not respond to the thawing of the peat soil. The CO2 and N2O emission peaks were not captured by the manual chambers and hence we conclude that high time-resolution measurements with automatic chambers or EC are necessary to quantify fluxes during peak emission periods. Sub-canopy EC measurements and chamber-based fluxes of CO2 and N2O were comparable, although the fluxes of N2O measured by EC were close to the detection limit of the system. We conclude that if fluxes are high enough, i.e. greater than 5-10 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), the EC method is a good alternative to measure N2O and CO2 fluxes at ecosystem scale, thereby minimizing problems with chamber enclosures and spatial representativeness of the measurements.

SO FORESTS
LA English
DT Article
DE drainage; growth and yield; nutrients; peatland forestry
AB Drainage is an essential prerequisite in peatland forest management, which generally, but not always, increases stand growth. Growth response depends on weather conditions, stand and site characteristics, management and biogeochemical processes. We constructed a SUSI-simulator (SUoSImulaattori, in Finnish), which describes hydrology, stand growth and nutrient availability under different management, site types and weather conditions. In the model development and sensitivity analysis, we used water table (WT) and stand growth data from 11 Scots pine stands. The simulator was validated against a larger dataset collected from boreal drained peatlands in Finland. In validation, SUSI was shown to predict WT and stand growth well. Stand growth was mainly limited by inadequate potassium supply, and in Sphagnum peats by low oxygen availability. Model application was demonstrated for ditch network maintenance (DNM) by comparing stand growth with shallow (-0.3 m) and deep ditches (-0.9 m): The growth responses varied between 0.5 and 3.5 m(3) ha(-1) in five years, which is comparable to experimental results. SUSI can promote sustainable peatland management and help in avoiding unnecessary drainage operations and associated environmental effects, such as increased carbon emissions, peat subsidence, and nutrient leaching. The source code is publicly available, and the modular structure allows model extension to cost-benefit analyses and nutrient export to water courses.

AB Shallow, degraded peatlands differ in both their structure and function from deeper, peatland ecosystems. Previous work has shown that shallow, drained peatlands demonstrate rapid storm runoff that is only minimally controlled by antecedent hydrological conditions. However, such peatlands are also known to exhibit significant variation in ecohydrological organisation and structure across different spatial scales. In addition, predictions of hydrological response using spatially distributed numerical models of rainfall-runoff may be flawed unless they are evaluated with datasets describing the spatial variability of hydrological responses. This paper evaluates to what extent, flow generation and water storage within shallow, degraded peatland catchments may be controlled by the spatial attributes of the contributing area of the peatland, the drainage ditch size, morphology and geometry.
   Results from an experiment conducted over multiple spatial scales and multi-annual timescales highlights that subtle variations in the local slope and topography account for the long-term spatial patterns of water table depth. Neither the local scale of the drainage feature or the topographic contributing area is shown to be a definitive predictor of runoff in the studied catchments. Results also highlight the importance of using spatially distributed observations to ensure that estimates of water storage and runoff are representative of the fine scale spatial variability that occurs in such damaged and shallow peatlands.

AB Testate amoebae (Protozoa) were examined in a Picea mariana forested mire in northern Ontario, Canada to assess the use of testate amoebae as environmental bioindicators of drainage. Habitat types included Picea mariana trees, Ericaceae shrubs, and Sphagnum mosses. Several of the species or species groups recorded in the study area, emerged as showing significant differences in abundance between control and drained microsites. Significant differences were recorded between control and drained microsites for Cyclopyxis arcelloides-type Assulina muscorum and Centropyxis aerophila-type in certain site types.  In other site types Cyclopyxis arcelloides.  Trinema lineare, and Centropyxis aerophila-type, decreased in abundance with drainage whereas Assulina muscorum and Corythion dubium increased in abundance with drainage. This study demonstrates for the first time that alterations in the soil microenvironment from drainage are reflected almost immediately by the abundance of certain species of testate amoebae, some of which increase in number, whereas other decrease in number.  Testate amoebae may, therefore, be used to monitor environmental effects of drainage in peatland forestry.

TI Soil organic matter characterization of temperate peatland soil with
   FTIR-spectroscopy: effects of mire type and drainage intensity
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE

DT Article

AB Peatlands are an important component of the global carbon cycle because they comprise huge amounts of terrestrial carbon (C). Different conditions during peat formation and secondary peat decomposition affect the quantity and composition of soil organic matter (SOM) in peats. There are few comparative studies on the chemical composition of SOM in temperate peatland soil. This study investigates compositional changes of SOM functional groups in peats and corresponding peat-forming plants by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Three plant samples and 29 peat samples were taken from seven temperate peatland sites with different genesis and land-use intensity. Site-specific differences, such as genesis of the peat, were found to be reflected in the FTIR spectra. In general, there was more variation in FTIR spectra in samples from fens than in those from bogs and peat-forming plants. The samples from fens have a smaller C-H absorption band than those from bogs and plants, which reflects greater biochemical activity in the minerotrophic than ombrotrophic environments. In addition to peat genesis, drainage and secondary peat decomposition also affect SOM composition substantially. The larger amounts of aliphatic compounds in undrained peats could be explained by selective preservation caused by anaerobic conditions. With increasing drainage of the sites, there was a decrease in the C-H absorption that was accompanied by a relative increase in C=O absorption. These changes in absorption intensities reflect the enhanced aerobic decomposition and mineralization that accompanies drainage and land-use intensity. However, the degree of peat decomposition', a diagnostic tool used in the field, is not reflected by OM composition determined by FTIR spectroscopy. Our results contribute to further understanding of changes in SOM composition during peat formation and processes of secondary decomposition caused by drainage.

AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from pristine peatlands and peatlands drained for agriculture, forestry or peat extraction have been studied intensively. However, few studies have compared GHG emissions from peatlands under different land-use type within the same peatland area. This study examined methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and respiration (CO2) from a peatland complex in northern Finland, including a peatland used for grass cultivation, a Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens dominated forested peatland, a peat-extraction site and a pristine mire. Gas fluxes were measured in 2011 and 2012 with chambers during the snow-free period, and using the snow-gradient method in winter 2012/2013. Soil respiration was highest in the cultivated site (median during growing season 350 mg CO, m(-2) h(-1)), and lower in the forest site and in the peat-extraction site (median for growing season 49 and 130 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), respectively). The peat-extraction site and the cultivated site were large sources of N2O during the growing season (median 89 and 28 pig m(-2) h(-1), respectively) and during the winter (median 56 and 460 mu g m(-2) h(-1), respectively). The pristine site was a large source of CH4 during the growing season (median 0.98 mg m(-2) h(-1)), whereas CH4 emissions from the drained sites during the growing season were minor. However, during winter, the peat-extraction site and the cultivated site emitted CH4 (median 0.58 and 0.029 mg m(-2) h(-1), respectively). The cultivated site had the highest estimated CO2 equivalent emissions, due to the high CO2 and N2O fluxes, but the peat-extraction site also had large annual emissions, mainly as N2O. The study suggests that rising ground-water level from 60 to 40 cm could potentially mitigate the emissions from the cultivated site.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations are increasing in freshwaters worldwide, with important implications for aquatic ecology, biogeochemistry, and ecosystem services. While multiple environmental changes may be responsible for these trends, predicting the occurrence and magnitude of "browning" and relating such trends to changes in DOC sources versus hydrologic transport remain key challenges. We analyzed long-term trends in DOC concentration from the two dominant landscape sources (riparian soils and mire peats) and receiving streams in a boreal catchment to evaluate how browning patterns relate to land cover and hydrology. Increases in stream DOC were widespread but not universal. Browning was most pronounced in small, forested streams, where trends corresponded to twofold to threefold increases in DOC production in riparian soils and increases in annual DOC export from a forested headwater. By contrast, DOC did not change in mire peats or streams draining catchments with high lake or mire cover, nor did we observe trends in DOC export from a mire-dominated headwater. The distinct long-term trends in DOC sources also altered concentration-discharge relationships, with a forested headwater shifting from transport-limited toward chemostasis, and a mire outlet stream shifting from chemostasis to source-limitated. Modified DOC supply to headwaters, together with altered seasonal hydrology and differences in the dominant water source along the stream network gave rise to predictable browning trends and consistent concentration-discharge relationships. Overall, our results show that the sources of DOC to boreal aquatic ecosystems are responding to environmental change in fundamentally different ways, with important consequences for browning along boreal stream networks.

AB Natural peat soils serve as important sinks for nutrients, organic components, and water. Peat soils can pose major environmental problems when they are drained for agricultural production, which may change their role in the landscape from a sink to a source. To successfully restore and conserve peat soils, it is important to understand the soil-moisture dynamics and water demand of drained peat soils for different climate and groundwater conditions. For this purpose, we conducted a series of lysimeter experiments with peat soils subject to different groundwater levels. Evapotranspiration (ET) rates and upward capillary fluxes in peat soils under grass were measured, while TDR probes and tensiometers were used to monitor the soil-water dynamics in the lysimeter during the growing season. The lysimeter data were simulated using an extended version of HYDRUS-1D to enable ET calculations using the Penman-Monteith equation. A physically based approach was tested to predict the canopy resistance as a function of the average pressure head of the soil root zone. The numerical simulations closely followed the observed soil-moisture dynamics in the lysimeter and were consistent with measured differences in ET rates for different groundwater levels. Besides average climate conditions, the effects of extreme dry and wet weather conditions on ET and groundwater recharge during the growing season were evaluated using the calibrated numerical model for different groundwater levels. Evapotranspiration rates during dry years depended very much on upward capillary flow from the water table and hence on the soil hydraulic properties. During wet years, however, ET was controlled mostly by the evaporative demand of the atmosphere, and much less by the soil hydraulic properties.

AB The degree of aggregation of peat substrate and the size of structural elements can be used to distinguish between different stages of a peatland evolution and characterize relic features in the profile of modern peat soil. Carbon fractions separated from different aggregates are indicative of the age of peat accumulated in the period of active growth of the peatland and of the age of peat transformed during the peatland drying. On the basis of these data, annual rates of peat growth at different evolution stages can be determined, as well as the rates of organic carbon sequestration and the amount of peat forming from plant remains.

AB Human activities have enhanced the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from organic soils. Drained peat soils may turn into a source of CO2 and N2O, whereas CH4 emission may generally decrease after drainage. Agricultural use, including ploughing, fertilization and irrigation, further enhances the decomposition of peat, and CO2 and N2O emissions. Cultivated organic soils are therefore significant sources of CO2 and N2O. In this paper we report greenhouse gas emissions from cultivated organic soils, and from abandoned organic agricultural soils, i.e. from organic soils where cultivation practices have ceased. We found that CO2 and N2O emissions from abandoned organic cropland soils do not generally decrease with time after agricultural practices have ceased, whereas CH4 fluxes from the atmosphere into the soil may gradually increase after leaving cultivation.

AB Swamp forests and marsh lands of the forest hydromelioration fund of the Vologda region occupy an area of 1,014,400 hectares; 742,100 ha are concentrated on forest-covered lands. The use of a complex of forest management measures - drainage, improvement cutting, felling of mature and over-mature stands - can increase the productivity of excessively moistened forests. The experience of integrated forest management is necessary for the scientific substantiation of the use of certain methods of cutting on drained peat soils. The issues of the formation of optimal species and age composition of stands on drained lands by means of a certain felling system in the region deserve attention. The goal of research is to identify optimal conditions for thinning in middle-aged pine forests on drained lands that ensure the cultivation of sustainable productive forest plantations. The experimental material is collected at stationary facilities of the Vologda region; the research results in pine forests on the soils of mesotrophic and oligomesotrophic types of waterlogging are summarized; conclusions and practical recommendations are presented. Morphometric parameters of stands are determined on trial plots. The processing of dynamic replications of inventory on trial plots with numbering is carried out by dividing the forest into fixed steps and revealing the growth dynamics for them. More highly productive plantations can be grown in conditions of increased moisture in the Vologda region. Scientifically grounded thinning should be marked among the measures for forest management intensification. A controlled process of thinning will allow stabilizing the structure of the forest fund and increasing the productivity of plantations. The thinning process is of great importance in the plantations that have been drained, due to the intensification of attrition and differentiation of trees. The improvement of plantation stand indicators on drained peat soils is possible only with the use of high-intensity thinning.

AB Wetlands can either be net sinks or net sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs), depending on the mean annual water level and other factors like average annual temperature, vegetation development, and land use. Whereas drained and agriculturally used peatlands tend to be carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) sources but methane (CH4) sinks, restored (i.e. rewetted) peatlands rather incorporate CO2, tend to be N2O neutral and release CH4. One of the aims of peatland restoration is to decrease their global warming potential (GWP) by reducing GHG emissions.
   We estimated the greenhouse gas exchange of a peat bog restoration sequence over a period of 2 yr (1 July 2007-30 June 2009) in an Atlantic raised bog in northwest Germany. We set up three study sites representing different land use intensities: intensive grassland (deeply drained, mineral fertilizer, cattle manure and 4-5 cuts per year); extensive grassland (rewetted, no fertilizer or manure, up to 1 cutting per year); near-natural peat bog (almost no anthropogenic influence). Daily and annual greenhouse gas exchange was estimated based on closed-chamber measurements. CH4 and N2O fluxes were recorded bi-weekly, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) measurements were carried out every 34 weeks. Annual sums of CH4 and N2O fluxes were estimated by linear interpolation while NEE was modelled.
   Regarding GWP, the intensive grassland site emitted 564 +/- 255 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) and 850 +/- 238 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) in the first (2007/2008) and the second (2008/2009) measuring year, respectively. The GWP of the extensive grassland amounted to -129 +/- 231 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) and 94 +/- 200 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1), while it added up to 45 +/- 117 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) and -101 +/- 93 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) in 2007/08 and 2008/09 for the near-natural site. In contrast, in calendar year 2008 GWP aggregated to 441 +/- 201 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1), 14 +/- 162 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) and 31 +/- 75 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) for the intensive grassland, extensive grassland, and near-natural site, respectively.
   Despite inter-annual variability, rewetting contributes considerably to mitigating GHG emission from formerly drained peatlands. Extensively used grassland on moderately drained peat approaches the carbon sequestration potential of near-natural sites, although it may oscillate between being a small sink and being a small source depending on inter-annual climatic variability.

AB Anthropogenic disturbances cause biotic homogenization through the replacement of specialist species with generalists. Restoration has the potential to counteract these negative effects. Recently, restoration in the peatlands of Northern Europe has started to show positive effects on biodiversity. However, seldom have studies evaluated the response of insects to restoration by comparing populations prior to restoration to those thereafter with a Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) design. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the restoration actions taken were appropriate to facilitate the successful recolonization of mire butterflies and plants. We found that, generally, drainage was negatively associated with mire specialist butterfly species and butterfly and plant communities, while generalist butterflies were not or were positively associated with drainage. In addition, mire specialist butterflies responded negatively to environmental variables associated with drained mires (number of tall trees) and positively to pristine mire-associated variables (larval food plant cover, number of low trees). Although restoration had a significantly positive effect on only two mire specialist butterflies (Boloria aquilonaris, Colias palaeno), it had a significantly positive effect on overall specialist species abundance. Furthermore, the structure of the butterfly and plant communities in restored sites became more similar to pristine sites a few years after restoration. We conclude that the restoration actions taken (removing tall trees but leaving smaller trees, and raising the water table level) are appropriate in creating suitable habitat conditions for mire butterflies. Finally, appropriate restoration actions in well-prioritized locations can reverse the trend of biotic homogenization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; FRESH-WATER; MATTER; TRENDS
AB The functional properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from Rough Sike, a stream draining blanket peat in the northern Pennines, UK, were investigated using a series of 12 standardised assays. Nine stream samples were collected at different discharges during 2003-2006, and DOM concentrates obtained by low temperature rotary evaporation. Suwannee River Fulvic Acid was used as a quality control standard in the assays. Dissolved organic matter in high-discharge samples was more light-absorbing at 280 and 340 nm and adsorbed more strongly to alumina, than DOM characteristic of low streamflow, but was less fluorescent and hydrophilic, and poorer in proton-dissociating groups. No significant differences were found in light absorption at 254 nm, copper- or benzo(a)pyrene binding, or photochemical fading. Combination of the Rough Sike data with previously-published results for other streams and a lake yields totals of 20-23 values per assay, for a range of DOM types. For the combined data, variability in all the assays is significant (p < 0.001), as judged by comparison with variations in repeat measurements on the quality control standard. Analysis of the combined data shows that DOM hydrophilicity and adsorption are well-predicted by linear relationships with the extinction coefficient at 340 nm (E-340), while good quadratic relationships exist between E340 and both buffering capacity and fluorescence.

AB Restoration of degraded peatland ecosystems (by rewetting) is undertaken to bring back key ecosystem services. However, the restoration process can have a range of ecohydrological effects, due to the associated physical and biogeochemical disturbance. In the case of northern peatlands drained by large and deep ditches, the rewetting effects are relatively unknown. The raised bog Grande plee Bleue (1,500 ha) is one of the largest pristine bogs in the St-Lawrence lowlands in North America; however, it contained an old (>60 years), 750 m long, 3.5 m deep, and 8 m wide ditch. Rewetting of the area affected by the ditch was carried out by the construction of six dams at 40 cm elevation intervals and felling of all trees (with diameter at breast height >10 cm) within 30 m. Water table was restored to levels similar to intact bog reference sites, only at elevation differences up to 17 cm from the nearest lower dam, while rewetting did not affect pore-water chemistry. Five to 6 years post-rewetting, the cover of both pioneer mosses, and late successional mosses (Sphagnum) had not changed significantly compared with pre-rewetting. This may have been due to the presence of dense shrub cover. For more effective ecohydrological restoration, dams should be spaced at smaller elevation intervals (e.g., every 20 cm of elevation or less), to allow recovery of water table along the entire length of the ditch, and vegetation introduction using the moss layer transfer technique may accelerate Sphagnum recruitment, especially in the few first metres from the ditch.

   PEATLANDS; CO2 EXCHANGE; CH4 FLUXES; N2O; TILLAGE; GRASS; FORESTRY
AB Management of peat soils is regionally important as they cover large land areas and have important but conflicting ecosystems services. A recent management trend for drained peatlands is the control of greenhouse gases (GHG) by changes in agricultural practices, peatland restoration or paludiculture. Due to complex antagonistic controls of moisture, water table management can be difficult to use as a method for controlling GHG emissions. Past studies show that there is no obvious relationship between GHG emission rates and crop type, tillage intensity or fertilization rates. For drained peat soils, the best use options can vary from rewetting with reduced emission to efficient short term use to maximize the, profit per amount of greenhouse gas emitted. The GHG accounting should consider the entire life cycle of the peatland and the socio-economic benefits peatlands provide locally. Cultivating energy crops is a viable option especially for wet peat soils with poor drainage, but harvesting remains a challenge due to tractability of wet soils. Paludiculture in lowland floodplains can be a tool to mitigate regional flooding allowing water to be stored on these lands without much harm to crops. This can also increase regional biodiversity providing important habitats for birds and moisture tolerant plant species. However, on many peatlands rewetting is not possible due to their position in the landscape and the associated difficulty to maintain a high stable water table. While the goal of rewetting often is to encourage the return of peat forming plants and the ecosystem services they provide such as carbon sequestration, it is not well known if these plants will grow on peat soils that have been altered by the process of drainage and management. Therefore, it is important to consider peat quality and hydrology when choosing management options. Mapping of sites is recommended as a management tool to guide actions. The environmental status and socio-economic importance of the sites should be assessed both for continued cultivation but also for other ecosystem services such as restoration and hydrological functions (flood control). Farmers need advice, tools and training to find the best after-use option. Biofuels might provide a cost-efficient after use option for some sites. Peat extraction followed by rewetting might provide a sustainable option as rewetting is often easier if the peat is removed, starting the peat accumulation from scratch. Also this provides a way to finance the after-use. As impacts of land use are uncertain, new policies should consider multiple benefits and decisions should be based on scientific evidence and field scale observations. The need to further understand the key processes and long term effects of field scale land use manipulations is evident. The recommended actions for peatlands should be based on local condition and socio-economic needs to outline intermediate and long term plans. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Overland flow is an important component of peatland hydrology. Hydrological models of peatlands are being developed that require estimates of flow velocity and its controls. However, surprisingly little is known about overland flow velocities in peatlands. Some peatlands have also been drained using open ditches, and these need to be incorporated into flow models. This paper presents field data on the velocity of overland flow and drain flow in upland peatlands. The relationships between flow velocity, vegetation cover, slope, and water depth are explored. Sphagnum provided a significantly greater effective hydraulic roughness to overland flow than peatland grasses. In all cases, a significant break in process occurred for flows with water depths of around 1 cm so that there were two components of the roughness curve. This is consistent with partial submergence theory for very shallow flows where resistance increases with depth as the soil surface first becomes fully submerged. While each surface cover type should be considered separately, the results also suggest that a first-order estimate of Darcy-Weisbach roughness and mean velocity can be based on a single parameter for each surface cover. This paper presents an empirical overland flow velocity forecasting model that can be applied to peatlands. The model combines the partially submerged component for flows with water depths below 1 cm with the fully submerged component for flows with depths up to 5 cm, which are representative of the depths of flows that occur across peatlands.

AB Anthropogenic disturbance (drainage and peat harvesting works in adjacent area) accelerates water outflow from and mineralization of top peat layer in the raised bog of Aukstumala Telmological Reserve (Western Lithuania) thus inducing peatland degradation and promoting penetration of atypical plant species and woody vegetation. Possibilities of restoration of the most affected parts of the Aukstumala raised bog (contact zone of the bog and peat harvesting fields) were investigated. Specifically, we aimed to assess effectiveness of two different means of hydrological regime restoration installed in the contact zone: (i) bog isolation from peat harvesting fields (to prevent direct water runoff) using polyethylene membrane (PM measure, installed in November 2006) and "peat lock" system (PL measure: water runoff blocked by highly decomposed peat; installed in November 2010), and (ii) blocking of ditches of the old drainage system using peat dams (PD measure, installed in November 2012). The research was carried out by performing monthly (from April to October) water level measurements in a system of water level monitoring profiles installed in zones of impact of each measure and non-treated (control) areas. Moreover, dendrochronological analysis of pine growth was performed in PM-treated and control areas.
   Although in general positive effect of the applied treatments (raised water table, reduced amplitudes of seasonal water level fluctuation, reduced radial increment of pine trees, re-establishment of Sphagnum cover) could be observed, none of the three measures has fully restored hydrological regime to create favourable conditions for peat accumulation and thriving of typical raised bog communities. The results of the present study suggest that aiming to more efficiently regulate hydrological regime in drainage-affected parts of the Aukstumala raised bog, blocking or filling of the old drainage system should always be applied in combination with the installation of water insulation measures along the contact zone of the bog and peat harvesting fields. Longer observation time is needed to fully assess the effect of the installed restoration measures on hydrology and ecosystem functioning in the raised bog of Aukstumala Telmological Reserve.

AB Methane emission feedbacks in wetlands are predicted to influence global climate under climate change and other anthropogenic stressors. Herein, we review the taxonomy and physiological ecology of the microorganisms responsible for methane production in peatlands. Common in peat soils are five of the eight described orders of methanogens spanning three phyla (Euryarchaeota, Halobacterota and Thermoplasmatota). The phylogenetic affiliation of sequences found in peat suggest that members of the thus-far-uncultivated group Candidatus Bathyarchaeota (representing a fourth phylum) may be involved in methane cycling, either anaerobic oxidation of methane and/or methanogenesis, as at least a few organisms within this group contain the essential gene, mcrA, according to metagenomic data. Methanogens in peatlands are notoriously challenging to enrich and isolate; thus, much remains unknown about their physiology and how methanogen communities will respond to environmental changes. Consistent patterns of changes in methanogen communities have been reported across studies in permafrost peatland thaw where the resulting degraded feature is thermokarst. However much remains to be understood regarding methanogen community feedbacks to altered hydrology and warming in other contexts, enhanced atmospheric pollution (N, S and metals) loading and direct anthropogenic disturbances to peatlands like drainage, horticultural peat extraction, forestry and agriculture, as well as post-disturbance reclamation.

AB Previous studies, conducted at the inception of rewetting degraded peatlands, reported that rewetting increased phosphorus (P) mobilization but long-term effects of rewetting on the soil P status are unknown. The objectives of this study were to (i) characterize P in the surface and subsurface horizons of long-term drained and rewetted percolation mires, forest, and coastal peatlands and (ii) examine the influence of drainage and rewetting on P speciation and distributions using wet-chemical and advanced spectroscopic analyses. The total P was significantly (p < 0.05) different at the surface horizons. The total concentration of P ranged from 1022 to 2320 mg kg-1 in the surface horizons and decreased by a factor of two to five to the deepest horizons. Results of the chemical, solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and P K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) indicated that the major proportions of total P were organic P (Po). In the same peatland types, the relative proportions of Po and stable P fractions were lower in the drained than in the rewetted peatland. The results indicate that long-term rewetting not only locks P in organic matter but also transforms labile P to stable P fractions at the surface horizons of the different peatland types.

AB Combining peatland rewetting with biomass cropping (paludiculture) is one strategy to remove nutrientsurpluses from soil/water and stimulate peat-forming vegetation. This approach was tested in the Mas-saciuccoli Lake Basin (Tuscany, Italy), a coastal floodplain artificially drained for agricultural purposessince 1930, where land reclamation and continuous cropping have contributed to considerable peatdegradation and water eutrophication due to nutrient enrichment of surface waters. An experimentaltrial was established in spring 2012 with three perennial rhizomatous grasses (PRG) (Phragmites aus-tralis, Miscanthus X giganteus, Arundo donax) and two woody species managed as short-rotation coppice(SRC) (Salix alba Dimitrios, Populus X canadensis Oudenberg), aimed to provide biomass for variousbioenergy supply chains. A conventionally cultivated annual crop (maize) was the control. The aim of thisstudy was to compare the sustainability of the proposed paludiculture systems to that of conventionalannual crops on the basis of yield and nutrient-removal capability. This two-year field study evaluatedyields, nutrient concentrations and uptake (N and P) of the crops. Over the two years, A. donax had thehighest mean biomass yield (35 Mg ha(-1)), N uptake (367 kg ha(-1)), and P uptake (54 kg ha(-1)). SRCs hadthe lowest nutrient uptake in both years. Among grasses, the highest N concentration was recorded inA. donax leaves in 2013 (N: 2.41%), while P concentration was greater in S. alba branches (P: 0.39%). Theaverage aboveground biomass of maize was 17.5 Mg ha(-1), while the nutrient uptakes were equal to 194and 27 kg ha(-1)for N and P, respectively.
   Thus, the performances of paludiculture systems were generally encouraging and could represent animportant alternative for restoring and managing former drained peatlands in a suitable product chain. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatland practitioners and scientists have increasingly recognised the damage resulting from various management methods, and the need to restore peatlands to achieve several potential benefits. Many of the hoped-for benefits of peatland restoration, such as Carbon storage, biodiversity conservation and water quality improvements, are thought to depend on a reinstatement of high water tables that had been reduced by drainage. Despite the current emphasis on restoring drained peatlands, many of the predicted responses to restoration are still not adequately proven and the mechanisms behind them still uncertain. This study reports on water table and discharge responses to drain blocking restoration of a degraded Welsh upland blanket bog. Restoration work and monitoring were designed to permit a novel catchment scale control-intervention experimental design. An information theoretic approach to examining the data provided evidence of increases in water retention and water tables within the bog after restoration. But the study also demonstrated the importance of small and large scale topography in determining the degree of these responses. The increases in water storage after restoration produced lower discharge rates observable at the level of both drains and hill streams; as well as greater water table stability, reduction in peak flows and increases in water residency after rainfall. Crucially, this study showed strong catchment scale differences in response, and a very gradual recovery of water tables, both of which highlight the need for more studies to be carried out at the landscape scale and over longer time periods.

AB In western Finland, acid leaching to watercourses is mainly due to drainage of acid sulphate (AS) soils. This study examined how different land-use and land-cover types affect water acidity in the northwestern coastal region of Finland, which has abundant drained AS soils and peatlands. Sampling conducted in different hydrological conditions in studied river basins revealed two different catchment types: catchments dominated by drained forested peatlands and catchments used by agriculture. Low pH and high electric conductivity (EC) were typical in rivers affected by agriculture. In rivers dominated by forested peatlands and wetlands, EC was considerably lower. During spring and autumn high runoff events, water quality was poor and showed large spatial variation. Thus it is important to ensure that in river basin status assessment, sampling is carried out in different hydrological situations and in also water from some tributaries is sampled.

AB Considerable nitrogen (N) mineralization occurs in drained peat soils in use for dairy grassland, due to aerobic decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). N losses may be limited by matching grass N uptake with N mineralization and by adapting on-farm fertilization schemes to soil N supply (SNS) and apparent N recovery (ANR). Previous attempts to predict SNS of peat grasslands from soil parameters have been unsuccessful, partly due to high variation in SNS between sites and years. In this paper, we present field data from twenty dairy grasslands on drained peat (29-65% SOM; Terric Histosols). Grass yield parameters (e.g. SNS and ANR) were compared with a comprehensive data set of soil biotic and abiotic properties measured at the start of the growing season, and with N mineralization calculated from this data. SNS ranged between 171 and 377 kg N ha(-1) (mean: 264 kg N ha(-1)) during the growing season. Soil N mineralization estimated by laboratory incubation and by foodweb-based production ecological calculations gave similar mean values with slightly higher coefficients of variation, but correlations with SNS were not significant. Regression analysis with soil properties showed a positive correlation between SNS and soil Ca:Mg ratio and a negative correlation between fertilized grass yield and soil C:SOM ratio. No significant models were found for ANR. Based on our data and on literature, we conclude that these parameters indicate linkages between grass yield and soil physical-hydrological properties such as soil structure and water availability. In particular, the C:SOM ratio in these soils with high organic matter content may be an indicator of water repellency, and our results suggest that grass growth was limited by drought more than by nutrient availability.

AB We studied the properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in drained boreal peatland in stem-only-harvested (SOH), whole-tree-harvested (WTH), and unharvested sites. The DOM derived from both aerobic and anaerobic peat layers was divided into four different molecular-weight fractions with ultrafiltration, and the fractions were measured for the concentrations of dissolved organic C (DOG), N, and carbohydrates, aromaticity (specific ultraviolet [UV] absorbance at 254 nm), pH, and bioavailability to bacteria. The percentage of DOG in the low-molecular-weight ([MW) fraction was higher in the deeper than in the upper layer. We suggest that easily degradable [MW compounds with low aromatic character and high bioavailability had not degraded in the deeper layer under anaerobic conditions. This had produced a relative enrichment of [MW DOC in the anaerobic layer. A different relation to aerobicity was observed in alternating aerobic conditions in the upper layer alone, where the high-molecular-weight compounds seemed to increase under more anaerobic conditions. Thus the properties and processes of DOM in peatlands seem to be controlled by the aerobicity in a complicated manner. We suggest that operations that affect the water table level in peatland affect also the properties of peat DOM. The properties of DOM that could be connected to clear-cut harvest-induced changes in the recent inputs of C and N were small. Peat DOM was more N rich in harvested than in control sites. Thus it seems possible that N is susceptible to leaching after harvest in naturally relatively N-rich sites and especially in mineral form.

AB Land-use conversion of pristine boreal peatlands for agricultural purposes is an ongoing process and projected to become more intensive with rising population growth and increased demands for food production. However, agricultural use of peatlands affects the production and emission of nitrous oxide (N2O), a very potent greenhouse gas currently gaining more attention in the global assessment of greenhouse gases. While the intensity of N2O emissions depends on a range of environmental factors, including hydrological parameters, temperature and the availability of nitrogen in soils, key driving processes remain poorly understood. In order to understand the effects of land-use change on the peatland ecosystem, we quantified N2O fluxes under different land-use in a comparative study between a natural bog and an adjacent abandoned pasture in Newfoundland, Canada. We conducted in situ gas flux measurements using the static chamber method over five growing seasons. In addition, we measured photosynthetic rates and environmental parameters, namely soil temperature and moisture, water table and concentrations of total nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon in pore waters. According to previous studies, we hypothesized higher N2O emissions from the abandoned pasture due to drainage compared to the natural bog. However, despite significant differences of environmental parameters and photosynthetic rates, we found no significant difference of N2O fluxes between the two sites. We argue that N2O production at the abandoned pasture was inhibited due to exhaustion of plant-available nitrogen as a result of increased gross primary production compared to the natural bog. We conclude that the effect of drainage and fertilization on N2O fluxes during the growing season was superposed by vegetation composition change effects at the abandoned pasture, leading to similar N2O fluxes at both sites.

AB The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge (GDS) is a large temperate swamp in Virginia/North Carolina, USA with peat soils historically resistant to microbial decomposition. However, this peatland has been subject to similar to 200 years of disturbance during which extensive drainage, fire suppression, and widespread logging have increased decomposition and dramatically decreased the distribution of Atlantic white cedar (AWC). The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of long-term drainage and AWC loss on the carbon chemistry of GDS peats. Peat cores were collected from three drained GDS vegetation communities (pocosin, AWC, and red maple-black gum) and compared to cores collected from an intact, undrained AWC peatland at the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge (AR) in North Carolina. The AR peats had higher lignin content in the deeper peat intervals, and lignin content and percent organic carbon were largely invariant with depth compared to the GDS peats. The concentrations of syringyl group phenols were greater in the surface layers of GDS peats, likely reflecting the selective removal of AWC and transition from gymnosperms to angiosperms. Acid to aldehyde ratios for vanillyl and syringyl group phenols indicated that the GDS peats were more decomposed, particularly at depth, and that this occurred under aerobic conditions. Moreover, solid-state C-13 NMR confirmed a coincident loss of carbohydrates and increase in recalcitrant by-products of carbohydrate degradation with depth. These data indicate that long-term drainage has accelerated the decomposition of peat at the GDS, reducing the capacity and stability of the carbon sink.

AB Measurements of CH4 flux from drained and undrained sites in three northern Ontario peatlands (a treed fen, a forested bog, and a treed bog) were made from the beginning of May to the end of October 1991. In the drained portions, the water table had been lowered between 0.1 and 0.5 m, compared to the water table of the undrained portion of the peatlands. The mean seasonal CH4 flux from the undrained portions of three peatlands was small, ranging from 0 to 8 mg m-2 d-1 , but similar to the CH4 flux from other treed and forested northern peatlands. The mean seasonal CH4 flux from the drained portion of the peatlands was either near zero or slightly negative (i.e  uptake): fluxes ranged from 0.1 to -0.4 mg m-2 d-1. Profiles of CH4 in the air-filled pores in the unsaturated zone, and the water-filled pores of the saturated zone of the peat at the undrained sites, showed that all the CH4 produced at depth was consumed within 0.2 m of the water table and that atmospheric CH4 was consumed in the upper 0.15 m of the peatland. On the basis of laboratory incubations of peat slurries to determine CH4 production and consumption potentials, the lowering of the water table eliminated the near-surface zone of CH4 production that existed in the undrained peatland. However, drainage did not alter significantly the potential for CH4 oxidation between the water table and peatland surface but increased the thickness of the layer over which CH4 oxidation could take place. These changes occurred with a drop in the mean summer water table of only 0.1 m (from -0.2 to -0.3 m) suggesting that only a small negative change in soil moisture would be required to significantly reduce CH4 flux from northern peatlands.

AB The dynamics of wood productivity on drained peatland sites was analyzed from the covariance structure generated by stand yield data of repeatedly measured permanent sample plots in 81 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) or Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst. (L.)) stands with admixtures of birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.). The site production potential, considered a latent variable, was assumed to follow an autoregressive process over time elapsed since drainage. As a measure of the latent variable, a relative growth rate (RGR) index was determined for all stands at the time of drainage and at four successive measurement time points following drainage ton average 16, 23, 30, and 41 years). The index was calculated as the site index of an upland conifer stand with the ratio of periodic volume growth and standing volume and adjusted by changes in stand stocking and thinning. The observed covariance structure was described by fitting a structural equation model to the data of RGR indices. When only the post-drainage measurement times were included, a quasi-simplex model with equal error variances and equal structural parameters at different measurement times fit the data well indicating a permanent covariance structure among the different measurements. Including the measurement at the time of drainage resulted in a non-permanent structure. The stand parameters at the time of drainage were poorly correlated with post-drainage growth.
   A considerable increase in the wood productivity of the sites was observed, being greatest during twenty years after drainage and continuing up to 40 years since drainage. This was concluded to be due to changes in site properties rather than stand structure although the effects of the single factors could not be analytically separated from one another. Our modelling approach appeared to improve long-term site productivity estimates based merely on botanical site indices.

AB Northern peatlands contain a considerable share of the terrestrial carbon (C) pool, which climate change will likely affect in the future. The magnitude of this effect, however, remains uncertain, due mainly to difficulties in predicting decomposition rates in the old peat layers. We studied the effects of water level depth (WL) and soil temperature on heterotrophic soil respiration originating from peat decomposition (R(PD)) in six drained peatlands using a chamber technique. The microbial community structure was determined through PLFA. Within the studied sites, temperature appeared to be the main driver of R(PD). However, our results indicate that there exist mechanisms related to lower WL conditions that can tone down the effect of temperature on R(PD). These mechanisms were described with a mathematical model that included the optimum WL response of R(PD) and the effect of average WL conditions on the temperature sensitivity of R(PD). The following implications were apparent from the model parameterisation: (1) The instantaneous effect of WL on R(PD) followed a Gaussian form: the optimum WL for R(PD) was 61 cm. The tolerance of R(PD) to the WL however, was rather broad, indicating that the overall effect of WL was relatively weak. (2) The temperature sensitivity of R(PD) depended on the average WL of the plot: plots with a high average WL showed higher temperature sensitivity than did those under drier conditions. This variation in temperature sensitivity of R(PD) Correlated with microbial community structure. Thus, moisture stress in the surface peat layer or, alternatively, the lowered temperature sensitivity of R(PD) in low water level conditions via microbial community structure and biomass may restrict R(PD). We conclude that a warmer future climate may raise R(PD) in drained peatlands only if the subsequent decrease in the moisture of the surface peat layers is minor and, thus, conditions remain favourable for decomposition.

AB Currently, more than 10,000 ha of fens have been rewetted to re-establish their function as nutrient sinks in NE Germany. However, field investigations reveal that porewater concentrations of P, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ammonium in rewetted fens are orders of magnitude larger than under pristine conditions. Hence, the objective of this study was to investigate the reasons behind enhanced P, organic carbon (OC) and ammonium mobilisation due to rewetting by means of a long-term incubation experiment. Highly, moderately and slightly decomposed peat of a drained fen (polder Zarnekow) was incubated under waterlogged conditions. A time course of concentrations of P, DOC, ammonium, sulphate and other dissolved substances was investigated by means of permanently installed dialysis samplers during 54 weeks of incubation. Simultaneously, the concentrations of these dissolved substances were investigated after rewetting of the field site. Before, and at the end of the incubation study, the amounts of bicarbonate-dithionite (BD) and NaOH soluble P and OC of incubated peat samples were determined by a sequential extraction procedure. The highest mobilisation of P, OC and ammonium occurred in the highly decomposed peat. Final concentrations of P, DOC and ammonium reached about 143 mu M, 46 and 1.9 mM, respectively. The initial sulphate concentrations in the rewetting experiment, as well as in the field investigations, were extremely high and ranged between 3 and 13 mM; however, a complete consumption of sulphate was only observed in highly decomposed peat. In conclusion, the reasons for enhanced P, OC and ammonium mobilisation are increased amounts of redox sensitive substances and enhanced availability of decomposable organic matter in the upper highly decomposed peat horizon. These results should be considered in future rewetting management strategies.

AB We studied the success of natural regeneration for eight years after seed tree cutting on four drained peatland Scots pine stands in central and northern Finland (Parkano, Sievi, Vaala, Simo) when retaining ca. 50 Scots pine sterns ha(-1) followed by site preparation. The total number and the number of crop seedlings and their mean height were investigated by species and methods of site preparation (control, scalping, mounding). The results showed that the total seedling numbers were very high (9,600 - 51,000 ha(-1)) in all sites and treatments. The share of downy birch seedlings was 64 - 76 %. The total number of crop seedlings varied from 1,550 to 2,000 ha(-1) (2,000 maximum density accepted), with number of Scots pine seedlings varying from 600 in Parkano to 1,950 ha(-1) in Sievi. Site preparation increased the number of pine crop seedlings on two of the four sites: at Parkano by 900 - 1,100 seedlings ha(-1) and at Vaala by 600 - 800 seedlings ha(-1). On average, the number of pine crop seedlings was slightly higher and that for all birch seedlings clearly higher when site preparation was applied. About 22 - 81% of crop seedlings were grown in a prepared surface in scalped plots and 75-91% on mounded plots. The mean height of the crop seedlings was not significantly affected by the site preparation treatment. With respect to the minimum requirements set for the regeneration result required by forest legislation, seed tree cutting appeared to provide sufficient regeneration in eight years in terms of the total seedling density and the number of crop seedlings when downy birches were included. The beneficial effect of soil preparation was seen in the increased share of Scots pine crop seedlings.

AB Overland Bow technique, which involves conducting wastewater across a natural mire, has during the recent years been widely used in Finland to decrease the loading of P and other elements from peat mining areas to the watercourses. In this study the applicability of laboratory tests in estimating the P retention by overland Bow areas was assessed at a site in northern Finland. The ability of peat to retain PO4-P was determined by adsorption isotherms, and the data were compared with the actual decreases in P loads obtained in the held. The PO4-P retention curves obeyed rather well the conventional adsorption models, which suggests that sorption can be an important mechanism removing PO4-P from the pest mining drainage water during overflow treatment. The Freundlich equation gave a better fit to the P sorption than did the one-surface Langmuir model. The constants describing the sorption characteristics of the peat showed spatial and temporal variation. They indicated, however, that the theoretical effective P sorption time for the overland Bow area can be 20 to 25 yr. The ability of peat to retain P increased with increasing concentrations of oxalate extractable Fe and Al. Sorption reactions were found to be important in the annual decreases in PO4-P from drainage waters in an overland flow area, but their efficiency in removing P from the peat mining drainage water appears to depend on hydrological conditions. In the first experimental year, the sorption calculated from the isotherm data amounted to 60% of the retention obtained in the held. Owing to the high flow conditions in the second year, the decrease in the loading of P in the field was decisively lower than estimated.

AB Cultivation of bioenergy crops has been suggested as a promising option for reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from arable organic soils (Histosols). Here, we report the annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) fluxes of CO2 as measured with a dynamic closed chamber method at a drained fen peatland grown with reed canary grass (RCG) and spring barley (SB) in a plot experiment (n=3 for each cropping system). The CO2 flux was partitioned into gross photosynthesis (GP) and ecosystem respiration (R-E). For the data analysis, simple yet useful GP and R-E models were developed which introduce plot-scale ratio vegetation index as an active vegetation proxy. The GP model captures the effect of temperature and vegetation status, and the R-E model estimates the proportion of foliar biomass dependent respiration (R-fb) in the total R-E. Annual R-E was 1887 +/- 7 (mean +/- standard error, n=3) and 1288 +/- 19g CO2-Cm-2 in RCG and SB plots, respectively, with R-fb accounting for 32 and 22% respectively. Total estimated annual GP was -1818 +/- 42 and -1329 +/- 66g CO2-Cm-2 in RCG and SB plots leading to a NEE of 69 +/- 36g CO2-C m(-2)yr(-1) in RCG plots (i.e., a weak net source) and -41 +/- 47g CO2-C m(-2)yr(-1) in SB plots (i.e., a weak net sink). Standard errors related to spatial variation were small (as shown above), but more significant uncertainties were related to the modelling approach for establishment of annual budgets. In conclusion, the bioenergy cropping system was not more favourable than the food cropping system when looking at the atmospheric CO2 emissions during cultivation. However, in a broader GHG life-cycle perspective, the lower fertilizer N input and the higher biomass yield in bioenergy cropping systems could be beneficial.

AB Restoration efforts at peatlands drained for peat extraction attempt to return the hydrological conditions necessary for Sphagnum moss regeneration. One year of pre-restoration monitoring (1999) and three years of post restoration monitoring were done at the Bois-des-Bet peatland near Riviere-du-Loup, Quebec, to evaluate hydrological changes that occurred at a managed section (restored site) relative to an adjacent abandoned section of the same peat-land (unrestored site). Restored site evaporation was 74%, 74%, and 98% of unrestored site evaporation in 2000, 2001, and 2002, while runoff at the restored site was 83%, 30%, and 12% of unrestored site runoff over the same period. Seasonal soil volume change (swelling and shrinking of the peat) was evident at the restored site indicating rewetting of the peat profile despite the prolonged period between site abandonment and the initiation of the restoration measures (19 years). Site rewetting may have benefited from the relatively deep layer of residual peat (around 1.5 m). Higher seasonal mean water table and soil moisture were observed at the restored site relative to the unrestored site in 2000 through 2002 along with increased seasonal variability at the former location. Mean soil, water pressure was also higher than at the unrestored site and the range decreased, both spatially and on a seasonal and daily basis. The restoration techniques contributed to the recovery of hydrological conditions necessary for Sphagnum recolonization, though successful application at different sites may be limited by specific peat and climate characteristics.

AB Drainage and afforestation of peatlands cause extensive habitat degradation and species losses. Restoration supports peatland biodiversity by creating suitable habitat conditions, including stable high water tables. However, colonization by characteristic species can take decades or even fail. Peatland recovery is often monitored shortly after restoration, but initial trends may not continue, and results might differ among taxonomic groups. This study analyzes trends in plant, dragonfly, and butterfly diversity within 18 years after rewetting of montane peatlands in central Germany. We compared diversity and species composition of 19 restored sites with three drained peatlands and one near-natural reference site. Restoration resulted in improved habitat conditions and benefited species diversity, but there were marked differences among taxonomic groups. Dragonflies rapidly colonized small water bodies but their diversity did not further increase in older restoration sites. Characteristic peatland vegetation recovered slowly, since it depended on a high water holding capacity that was only reached after peat started accumulating. Generally, plant diversity developed toward reference conditions albeit incompletely, even 18 years after restoration. Butterflies responded less to peatland restoration; generalists increased only temporarily and specialists could not establish. In conclusion, peatland restoration improves habitat conditions and biodiversity, while trajectories of recovery are nonlinear and incomplete after two decades. This highlights the need for long-term monitoring and a strategic selection of indicator species for evaluation of restoration success.

AB We studied the dynamics of stand structure on drained peatland sites in Scots pine dominated stands untreated with thinnings. The data consisted of consecutive stand measurements in 10 permanent sample plots where the monitoring periods varied from 29 to 66 years. We assumed that the stand's structural development was driven by the natural processes of regeneration, growth, and mortality, all related to inter-tree competition within the stand. The DBH distributions of live and dead trees at different times of post-drainage stand development - smoothed by Weibull function - were analysed to characterise the change in stand structure. The initial uneven-sized structure of the natural, widely-spaced stands became more uneven during the first decades following drainage due to enhanced regeneration. Later, as stand density and mean tree size continuously increased, the DBH distributions approached bell-shaped distributions. Accordingly, the suppressed trees showed their highest mortality rate during the first decades, but the peak of the mortality distribution shifted to larger trees along stand succession. The change in structure was faster in southern Finland than in northern Finland. We assumed the changes in stand dynamics reflected increased inter-tree competition, initiated by enhanced site productivity and increased stand stocking resulting from the ditching operation.

AB Northern peatlands constitute a significant source of atmospheric methane (CH4). However, management of undisturbed peatlands, as well as the restoration of disturbed peatlands, will alter the exchange of CH4 with the atmosphere. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to collate and analyze published studies to improve our understanding of the factors that control CH4 emissions and the impacts of management on the gas flux from northern (latitude 40 degrees to 70 degrees N) peatlands. The analysis includes a total of 87 studies reporting measurements of CH4 emissions taken at 186 sites covering different countries, peatland types, and management systems. Results show that CH4 emissions from natural northern peatlands are highly variable with a 95% CI of 7.6-15.7 g C m(-2) year(-1) for the mean and 3.3-6.3 g C m(-2) year(-1) for the median. The overall annual average (mean +/- SD) is 12 +/- 21 g C m(-2) year(-1) with the highest emissions from fen ecosystems. Methane emissions from natural peatlands are mainly controlled by water table (WT) depth, plant community composition, and soil pH. Although mean annual air temperature is not a good predictor of CH4 emissions by itself, the interaction between temperature, plant community cover, WT depth, and soil pH is important. According to short-term forecasts of climate change, these complex interactions will be the main determinant of CH4 emissions from northern peatlands. Drainage significantly (p < .05) reduces CH4 emissions to the atmosphere, on average by 84%. Restoration of drained peatlands by rewetting or vegetation/rewetting increases CH4 emissions on average by 46% compared to the original premanagement CH4 fluxes. However, to fully evaluate the net effect of management practice on the greenhouse gas balance from high latitude peatlands, both net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and carbon exports need to be considered.

AB The summer of 2004 was one of the largest fire seasons on record for Alaska and western Canada. We construct a daily bottom-up fire emission inventory for that season, including consideration of peat burning and high-altitude (buoyant) injection, and evaluate it in a global chemical transport model (the GEOS-Chem CTM) simulation of CO through comparison with MOPITT satellite and ICARTT aircraft observations. The inventory is constructed by combining daily area burned reports and MODIS fire hot spots with estimates of fuel consumption and emission factors based on ecosystem type. We estimate the contribution from peat burning using drainage and peat distribution maps for Alaska and Canada; 17% of the reported 5.1 x 10(6) ha burned were located in peatlands in 2004. Our total estimate of North American fire emissions during the summer of 2004 is 30 Tg CO, including 11 Tg from peat. Including peat burning in the GEOS-Chem simulation improves agreement with MOPITT observations. The long-range transport of fire plumes observed by MOPITT suggests that the largest fires injected a significant fraction of their emissions in the upper troposphere.

AB Management impacts on dominant and keystone species form a major sustainability issue in forests, because such impacts can affect production of ecosystem goods and trigger extinction cascades. On acidic soils in northern forests, bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) is a well-known field-layer plant that is important culturally and as food for wildlife and humans, and is affected negatively by intensive forestry. In this paper, we analyse bilberry performance in a semi-natural forestry system (based on multiple native tree species and largely natural regeneration); specifically in relation to two major silvicultural activities timber harvest and wetland drainage. We combined plot- and landscape-scale data from a range of forest types varying in soil moisture and nutrient richness in Estonia, and compiled a landscape retrospective of bilberry abundance. Clear-cutting sharply reduced bilberry abundance on mineral soils and green-tree retention only slightly mitigated that impact; however, in drier sites, some recovery had started in 10 years. By the mature stage of production forests (60-80 years post clear-cutting), bilberry cover had recovered to the levels observed in old growth. Artificial drainage increased bilberry cover on poor peat soils, and partial cutting of drained pine forests further enhanced it. A retrospective analysis of these patterns in a forest-wetland landscape revealed a net increase in bilberry cover and berry production during the past 70 years. We conclude that the studied forestry system has increased bilberry cover in boggy areas with likely benefits to some herbivores (e.g. grouse) at the expense of wetland species; however, negative effects of clear-cutting prevail in dry pine forests that are the preferred berry-picking sites for humans.

ID LAND-USE; ACCURACY
AB Production (industrial) bogs are those from which pear is extracted, for fuel and horticultural purposes, using highly mechanised methods. The possible applications of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery to a production bog complex in Ireland were studied. Three distinct phases were identified in the life cycle of these bogs, i.e. pre-production, in-production and post-production. Within these categories, 13 land cover classes, ranging from virgin bog to after-use timber plantation, were identified and shown to be statistically separable on the satellite imagery. Some overlap was noted, particularly between the classes of low density production and recent cutaway bog, virgin bog and Sitka spruce plantation, and drained bog and unsuccessful timber plantation. A supervised classification of a satellite image was carried-out from which a land cover classification map was produced and the areas of the different classes were determined. An adjusted overall classification accuracy of 82% was achieved. Infrared (IR) TM bands 4 and 5 gave the best discrimination of land cover type, and demonstrated an advantage that multispectral imagery has compared with conventional aerial photography in this type of application. The potential of remotely sensed satellite data, as a single and cost-effective data source, to provide useful information on land cover types in production peatlands was demonstrated.

AB In the eastern Canadian boreal forest, drainage of unproductive black spruce peatlands is an infrequently used silvicultural treatment. The sparse scientific literature concerning its influence on tree growth is, however, relatively positive about the possibility of using drainage to convert unproductive stands into productive ones. This study aimed to address this issue by assessing the individual tree growth and by estimating the future stand productivity on a drained black spruce peatland stand. Results showed larger mean annual post-drainage stump diameter increment with increasing ditch proximity but they also showed the lack of effect of the treatment at distances greater than 15 m from the ditch. Small-sized trees reacted more strongly to the treatment than larger ones. Estimated site productivity was also influenced by the ditch proximity. The presence of excavating mounds on only one side of the ditch greatly influenced tree growth and site productivity. Considering the obtained results, intensive drainage operations, utilizing narrow ditch spacing, would be necessary in order to transform the type of unproductive sites studied into productive ones.

AB Peatland restoration is seen as an effective contribution to help achieve the aims of the Paris Agreement because currently huge amounts of peatlands in Northern Central Europe are under unsustainable drainage-based land use. If net zero greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands shall be reached by 2050, restoration measures have to be done as soon as possible. However, rewetting drained peatlands that were under intensive grassland use frequently results in high methane (CH4) emissions, which is often seen as a counter-argument against rewetting. To find the source of high CH4 emissions after rewetting and to explore the best possible way of peatland restoration (i.e., low CH4 emissions after rewetting) under near-natural conditions, we installed a field trial in a drained bog in north-western Germany. The trial consists of seven plots (similar to 8 x 24 m(2)) representing the status quo-intensive grassland use- and six restoration approaches with combinations of rewetting either on the original surface or after topsoil removal (TSR), biomass harvesting or spreading Sphagnum spp. to initiate vegetation succession. On all seven plots we measured CH4 fluxes using closed chambers. In addition, we investigated CH4 production potential by incubating soil samples and determining methanogen abundance by quantitative PCR. Compared to rewetting on the original surface, CH4 emissions were reduced on TSR plots by factor 30 to 400. Spreading of Sphagnum spp. had only little effect on CH4 emissions during the first year of establishment. TSR also reduced CH4 production potential and methanogen abundance. Further, the response of CH4 fluxes to methanogen abundance was lower after TSR. This suggests that both reduction in labile substrate and in methanogen abundance contribute to near-zero CH4 emissions after TSR. These are the first field-scale results that demonstrate the efficiency of removing degraded topsoil to avoid high CH4 emissions after rewetting. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peat bog harvesting is an important industry in many countries, including Canada. To harvest peat, bogs are drained and drainage water is evacuated towards neighboring rivers, estuaries or coastal waters. High suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) were found in the drainage water at one particular site during the 2001-2002 spring seasons in New Brunswick (Canada). The main objective of this study was to verify this observation at other sites, compare SSC levels leaving harvested peat bogs with those leaving an unharvested bog, and to determine if high SSC events happen only in Spring or all year round. Suspended sediment concentrations were monitored downstream of three harvested peat bogs and an unharvested reference bog located in New Brunswick during the ice free seasons of 2003-2004. On average, SSC at the harvested sites exceeded 25 mg/l, which is the recommended daily maximum concentration, 72% of the time, while the same concentration was exceeded 30% of the time at the unharvested sites. SSC were found to be significantly higher at harvested sites than at the reference sites for all seasons. The highest SSC medians were recorded in the Fall but SSC was elevated in all seasons. High SSC levels in receiving waters may be caused by field ditching activities and insufficient sediment controls. Findings suggest the NB Peat Harvesting 25 mg/l SSC guideline should be reviewed.

AB Changes in living and dead root biomass were monitored in the succession created by drainage for forestry on six sites from undrained to 55-yr-old drained tall-sedge pine mires in southern Finland. This was done to evaluate the role of root biomass in carbon cycling in drained peatland ecosystems. The total living Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) root and stump biomass varied from 190 g m(2) on an undrained site to 3060 g m(2) on the oldest drained site. The pine fine root biomass reached the maximum level within 22 yrs of drainage with a pine stand volume of 81 m(3) ha(-1). The pine coarse root and stump biomass increased with the age of the stand, comprising 90% of the total living root biomass on the 55-yr-old drained site. The drainage also increased the root biomass of field layer species; however, the roots of sedges were replaced by those of shrubs and trees. The dead fine root biomass was smallest on the two oldest drained sites, which could have resulted from a higher decomposition rate after improved aeration in the surface peat.

AB Peat extraction increases the phosphorus, nitrogen, organic matter, suspended solids, and iron concentrations in runoff, resulting in negative effects on downstream water bodies. Wetlands are commonly used as natural cost-effective solutions to mitigate these negative effects. This study analyzed changes in the quality of runoff water from peat extraction areas and the long-term efficiency of constructed wetlands. The results indicate that the quality of runoff water changed after the initial drainage and during peat extraction. Nitrogen leached at high concentrations in the early stages of peat extraction following drainage, whereas the leaching of iron and phosphorus increased after peat extraction from deeper layers. Comparison of water quality and impurities retained immediately after treatment wetland construction and 14 years later showed that the treatment wetland remained functional, with good retention capacity, over a long period.

AB Methane (CH4) fluxes from fixed sample plots in a minerotrophic fen and an ombrotrophic bog in southern Finland were measured by using a static chamber technique 1 year before and 2 years after a rewetting treatment. Methane emissions rose with rising water table after rewetting from 0.1 to 2.1 g.m(-2).a(-1) at the fen site and from 0.8 to 4.6 g.m(-2).a(-1) at the bag site remained at a lower level than emissions from similar pristine site types. At the fen site the emissions were related to the short-term succession of cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum L.). Emissions showed high spatial and temporal variation with high emission peaks at the bog site. Temporal fluctuation of the emissions during the measurement season (from the end of May to the end of September) was correlated with pear temperature, while the seasonal fluxes were dependent on the moisture conditions in different microsites.

AB We demonstrate the potential of using freely available satellite data from the Landsat ETM+ sensor for generating carbon balance estimates for lowland peatlands. We used a lowland ombrotrophic peatland in the UK as our test site representing a range of peatland conditions. A literature survey was undertaken to identify the simplest classification schema that could be used to distinguish ecohydrological classes for carbon sequestration on the peatland surface. These were defined as: active raised bog, Eriophorum-dominated bog, milled unvegetated peat and drained or degraded bog, with bracken and Carr woodland to define the bog edges. A maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) was used to map the spatial distribution of the six classes on the peatland surface. A Landsat ETM+ band-5 derived brightness-texture layer created using geostatistical methods greatly improved classification accuracies. The results showed the best accuracy of the MLC, when compared to finer scale methods, with Landsat ETM+ bands alone was 74%, which increased to 93% when including the brightness-texture layer. An estimate of carbon sequestration status of the site was performed that showed good agreement with the results of a finer-scale-based estimate. The coarse-scale map estimating -12000kg carbon and fine scale map estimating +23000kg carbon per annum. We conclude that with further development of our tool, if textural measures are used alongside optical data in MLC, it is possible to achieve good quality estimates of carbon balance status for peatland landscapes. This represents a potentially powerful operational toolkit for land managers and policy makers who require spatially distributed information on carbon storage and release for carbon pricing and effective land management.

AB Elevated suspended sediment (SS) loads released from peatlands after drainage operations and the resulting negative effect on the ecological status of the receiving water bodies have been widely recognized. Understanding the processes controlling erosion and sediment transport within the ditch network forms a prerequisite for adequate sediment control. While numerous experimental studies have been reported in this field, model based assessments are rare. This study presents a modeling approach to investigate sediment transport in a peatland ditch network. The transport model describes bed erosion, rain-induced bank erosion, floc deposition, and consolidation of the bed. Coupled to a distributed hydrological model, sediment transport was simulated in a 5.2 ha forestry-drained peatland catchment for 2 years after ditch cleaning. Comparing simulation results to measured SS concentrations suggested that the loose peat material, produced during excavation, contributed markedly to elevated SS concentrations immediately after ditch cleaning. Both snowmelt and summer rainstorms contributed critically to annual loads. Springtime peat erosion during snowmelt was driven by ditch flow whereas during summer rainfalls, bank erosion by raindrop impact was identified as an important process. Relating modeling results to observed spatial topographic changes in the ditch network was challenging and the results were difficult to verify. Nevertheless, the model has potential to identify risk areas for erosion. The results demonstrate that modeling is effective in separating the importance of different processes and complements pure experimental approaches. Modeling results can aid planning and designing efficient sediment control measures and guide the focus of experimental studies.

AB Thermokarst lakes form following the thaw of ice-rich permafrost and drain after a few decades to millennia. Drained thermokarst lake basins (DTLBs) become epicenters for peat accumulation and re-aggradation of ice-rich permafrost. This re-aggradation of permafrost may be interrupted by subsequent thermokarst lake formation with sufficient disturbance. Thermokarst lakes and DTLBs are abundant near Old Crow, Yukon, Canada, but little is known about their evolution through the Holocene. In this study, we investigate the hydrology and drainage histories of seven DTLBs from the Old Crow Flats on the basis of cryostratigraphy, radiocarbon dating, and pore-ice delta O-18 and delta H-2 records. Cryostratigraphic evidence implies only one of the seven studied DTLBs underwent multiple thermokarst cycles. Radiocarbon age-depth models demonstrate a slowdown in the rate of post-drainage peat accumulation with time. Pore-ice isotope analyses reveal a spectrum of possible post-drainage isotopic histories resulting from spatial variability in permafrost, vegetation, and hydrology. Unlike lacustrine silt, post-drainage peat contains relatively constant pore-ice isotope trends. In light of our findings, we propose that syngenetic peat permafrost in DTLBs preserve a warm-season sampling of local meteoric waters. These pore-ice delta O-18 and delta H-2 records may aid millennial-scale paleoclimate investigations, as we demonstrate through our reconstruction of Holocene climate change in northern Yukon.

AB DRAINMOD 6.1 was evaluated for hydrological simulation of two drained (1.0m drain depth, 20m spacing) peat extraction areas in Northern Finland. Water table depth (WTD) and drainage outflow were recorded continuously during two years, and the data were used for model calibration and validation. Despite some under- and overestimation of certain events, WTD fluctuations simulated quite accurately, whereas the model did not simulate drainage outflow well compared to observed data, especially for daily runoff. Mean absolute error (MAE) was 11.29 and 9.09cm and Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency (EF) was 0.64 and 0.62 for both study sites during the validation period, indicating good agreement between predicted and observed WTD. These results demonstrate that DRAINMOD 6.1 can satisfactorily simulate the WTD fluctuations in peat extraction areas in the cold climate of northern Finland, but further studies are needed to improve the model to better include frozen condition and peat extraction activities.

AB Predation by Carabus granulatus on three invertebrate groups, Lumbricidae, larval Elateridae, and larval Tipulidae was examined using the serological method, and it was found that earthworms and larval tipulids were consumed. The frequency of detection of their antigens in the diet of predators was significantly correlated with the intensity of soil surface searching by these prey. Earthworms, probably the species active on the soil surface, such as Dendrobaena octaedra and D. rubida, represented a permanent food supply for C. granulatus. Larval tipulids were abundant only in some sites. They were intensely exploited by carabids in spring, when they were active on the soil surface. Larval elaterids did not occur on the soil surface. so they were rarely detected in the diet of carabids.

AB A 12-month glass-house simulation experiment has been used to investigate the response of drainage water solute chemistry of Calluna and mixed grass moorland peat microcosms to elevated deposition of ammonium- and nitrate-N. Uptake for both N deposition species was greater for grass than for Ca(luna vulgaris turfs. Nitrification was negligible for the elevated ammonium-N treatments, which did not therefore enhance nitrate leaching, but did result in substantial increases in ammonium leaching for both vegetation types. However, the elevated nitrate treatments resulted in dramatically enhanced ammonium-N leaching and a more modest enhancement in the leaching of organic-N. The biological uptake minimises the acidification effect of the enhanced N depositions, with ca. 70% of the additional H+ inputs as HNO3 being consumed in N transformation reactions.

AB The role of vegetation and chemical factors in the development of the primary pedogenesis and evolution of pyrogenic formations resulting from fires on drained peat soils was studied. Over four years after the fire, a shallow (1 cm) humus horizon is formed on the surface of the ashy horizon of the pyrogenic formations. For six years, its thickness increases up to 3-4 cm. The dynamics and productivity of the plant cover on the pyrogenic formations were investigated. The dominant plant species were restricted to certain pyrogenic formations. The formation of stable phytocenoses and chemical transformation of substrates are the factors governing the primary pedogenesis on pyrogenic substrates. Four stages in the evolution of the pyrogenic formations were revealed. At the fourth stage, some features appeared that permit us to recognize the development of soddy soils on the pyrogenic substrates (i.e., soddy pyrogenic-mucky, soddy pyrogenic-sandy soils, etc.).

The contribution of the trees to the overall net CO2 flux was estimated using a carbon accounting model, calibrated to fit conifer volume yield data. The carbon exchange of the peat and ground vegetation was then the difference between the overall carbon flux and the amount accumulated in trees and tree litter. The undisturbed peat accumulated similar to0.25 t C ha(-1) a(-1). Newly drained peatland (2-4 years after ploughing) emitted between 2 and 4 t C ha(-1) a(-1), but when ground vegetation recolonized, the peatland became a sink again, absorbing similar to3 t C ha(-1) a(-1) 4-8 years after tree planting. Thereafter, the trees dominated the budget and afforested peatlands absorbed up to 5 t C ha(-1) a(-1). Assuming that the trees accumulated carbon at rates commensurate with yield class 10 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1), the peat beneath the trees after canopy closure was estimated to be decomposing at only similar to1 t C ha(-1) a(-1) or less. This is slower than previously thought and suggested that afforested peatlands in Scotland accumulate more carbon in trees, litter, forest soil and products than is lost from the peat for 90-190 years.

TI Estimation of the Biological Activity of Peat Soils from the Specific

SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The parameters of the potential biological activity (respiration, methanogenesis, nitrogen fixation, and denitrification) of drained peat soils were analyzed as depending on their morphological, chemical, and electrical properties. A high positive correlation was found between the potential respiration of the soil and its electrical resistance, because these parameters depended on the same soil properties: the ash content, the cation exchange capacity, etc. The correlation was disturbed under a significant adverse impact of the soil water-air regime on the microbial community, which was difficult to detect from the resistance. No correlation of anaerobic methanogenesis and denitrification with the resistance was found. The revealed relationships can find wide use in the study of the spatial distribution of the potential biological activity of soils, which will allow deriving more correct and representative data.

AB Recent peat soil problems, including failures of dykes, foundations, and slopes in peat deposits, have focused greater attention on understanding the mechanical behavior of peat. Stability calculations routinely involve effective stress analysis, with pertinent strength and stiffness parameters often determined from standard triaxial testing, without special consideration given to internal tensile reinforcement provided by the fiber content and the high compressibility of the peat material. This paper investigates consolidated-drained triaxial compression testing applied to peat soils. Significant differences in mini-structure and fiber content among test specimens of undisturbed, reconstituted, and blended peat materials were found not to cause significant differences in shear resistance under drained triaxial compression, with mobilized shear resistance increasing approximately linearly with increasing axial strain. Hence it was concluded that c' and phi' deduced from drained triaxial compression testing of peat are unlikely to be intrinsic material properties, and rather are largely a function of strain level, with higher values of phi' deduced for higher strain levels. The end of primary consolidation should be deduced from pore-water pressure measurements rather than the volume change response, although the repeatability of the triaxial consolidation tests was generally found to be poor on account of the natural variability of peat and the small size of the test specimens.

SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE

DT Article
AB The number and diversity of actinomycetes in peat soils vary in dependence on the stage of pyrogenic succession. In the cultivated peat soil, the number of actinomycetes after fires decreases by three-four times, mainly at the expense of acidophilic and neutrophilic groups. An increase in the number of mycelial prokaryotes (at the expense of alkaliphilic forms) is seen on the fifth year of functioning of the pyrogenic peat soil. The species diversity of streptomycetes in peat soils also decreases after fires. An increase in the range of streptomycetal species at the expense of neutrophilic and alkaliphilic forms takes place on the fifth year of the pyrogenic succession. Parameters of the actinomycetal complex-the population density, species composition, and ecological features-are the criteria whose changes allow us to judge the state of peat soils in the course of their pyrogenic succession.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is approximately 265 times more potent than carbon dioxide (CO2) in atmospheric warming. Degraded peatlands are important sources of N2O. The more a peat soil is degraded, the higher the N2O-N emissions from peat. In this study, soil bulk density was used as a proxy for peat degradation to predict N2O-N emissions. Here we report that the annual N2O-N emissions from European managed peatlands (EU-28) sum up to approximately 145 Gg N year(-1). From the viewpoint of greenhouse gas emissions, highly degraded agriculturally used peatlands should be rewetted first to optimally reduce cumulative N2O-N emissions. Compared to a business-as-usual scenario (no peatland rewetting), rewetting of all drained European peatlands until 2050 using the suggested strategy reduces the cumulative N2O-N emissions by 70%. In conclusion, the status of peat degradation should be made a pivotal criterion in prioritising peatlands for restoration.
   Rewetting agricultural peatlands first is the best strategy for reducing cumulative nitrous oxide emissions from European peatlands, according to an analysis of soil bulk density as a proxy for peat degradation.

AB A drained boreal bog with active drainage ditches and the introduction of forage grass was compared with a natural bog site to assess the effect of agricultural drainage on the photosynthetic capacity of boreal peatlands. In this study, the net carbon dioxide uptake and the ecosystem respiration were measured using a pair of clear and dark chambers, connected to a greenhouse gas analyzer in order to estimate the gross primary production (GPP). Environmental factors, including photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), peat soil temperature, soil moisture, electrical conductivity and water table depth (WTD), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soil pore water were also investigated at each site. Our results confirmed a correlation between water table depth, peat soil temperature, electrical conductivity and peatland productivity. Changes in electrical conductivity, water table depth, and peat soil temperature together explained 61% of gross primary productivity variance at our drained peatland pasture site. In general, plant functional types/growth forms did not have any significant difference in their GPP at the drained site except shrubs which had a significantly higher GPP at PAR level greater than 1000 mu mol/m(2)/s (F(3,30.84) = 11.64, p < 0.001). At the natural site, GPP was significantly higher at the hollow (0.168 +/- 0.02 mg/m(2)/s) compared to the hummock (0.098 +/- 0.01 mg/m(2)/s) where relatively the higher WTD was recorded. We therefore concluded that water shortage to the shallow rooting depth of shrubs on our hummock subplots may be the cause of the low productivity. At PAR greater than 1000 mu mol/m(2)/s, productivity at the hollow was still significantly higher (0.17 +/- 0.002 mg/m(2)/s) compared to the hummock (0.10 +/- 0.00 mg/m(2)/s). This suggests that, for ecosystem carbon modelling, the minimum PAR level at which the GPP is estimated is very crucial. All the growth forms at the drained site recorded a significantly higher GPP than the microforms at the natural site. We speculate that not only hydrological changes via agricultural drainage can affect the carbon balance of boreal peatland ecosystem through photosynthesis, but also the hydrological changes in the peat due to the differences in peat soil makeup, structure and density. We, therefore, conclude that differences in microtopography and the corresponding changes in vegetation, land-use practice and its effects on peat soil properties and hydrology should be taken into account when modelling the gross primary production in a peatland ecosystem.

AB We studied the nitrogen retention capacity of six peatland buffer areas constructed in forested catchments in southern and central Finland. The buffers (0.1-4.9% of the total catchment area) were either undrained mires or drained peatlands rewetted 4-7 years before the present study. The N retention capacity was studied by adding ammonium nitrate (NH(4)NO(3)-N) solution into the inflow waters of the buffers once (one area) or twice (five areas) during a period of 4-6 years. Except for the first N addition in one area, the three largest buffer areas (relative size > 1%) retained the added inorganic N almost completely; their retention efficiencies during the year of addition were > 93% for both NO(3)-N and NH(4)-N. Two of the three small buffers (relative size < 0.25%) were also able to reduce inorganic N from the through-flow waters effectively; their retention capacities for inorganic nitrogen varied between 58 and 89%. However, one small buffer area had a retention capacity of only < 20%. The factors contributing to efficient N retention were hydrological load during N addition, relative size of the buffer area, and its length, i.e. the distance between the inflow and outflow points. If there was any release of the added N, it mostly occurred within a relatively short-time period (< 100 days) after the treatment. The buffer areas appeared to be efficient and long-term sinks for inorganic nitrogen because the release of N during the 2-4 years after N addition was minor.

AB Ditch network maintenance in drained peatland forests increases sediment load and causes harmful effects on downstream watercourses. The objective of this study was to identify the immediate erosion processes in the ditch network and quantify the impact of the ditch network maintenance on suspended solids (SS) load at the catchment outlet. Ditch level processes were measured by conducting field campaigns and catchment-level responses were obtained by using the paired catchment approach. Measurements were conducted at two nested catchments in Koivupuro, Eastern Finland, where runoff and turbidity were monitored continuously at the catchment outlets and erosion and deposition were measured in selected ditches with a pin meter, erosion pins and sediment collectors. According to the results, the sediment load was at its highest during the first year after the ditch network maintenance and especially high during the first spring snow-melt period. Pin-meter measurements, sediment-collector data and results of ditch-bed erosion pins showed that the erosion was more severe in the ditch cut into mineral subsoil than in the ditch cut into thick peat. The SS load from the whole Koivupuro catchment during the first year after the ditch network maintenance was, depending on the estimation method, 185 or 250 kg treated-ha (1) a (1) (0.56 or 0.75 kg ditch-m (1)), while the net erosion within the ditch network was much higher, 6300 kg treated-ha (1) a (1) (19 kg ditch-m (1)), indicating that suspended solids were deposited before reaching the outlet of the catchment. Compared to the earlier studies which have focused on the catchment-level effects of ditch network maintenance on the SS loads, the current study succeeded in showing erosion processes and their variability within the ditch network and provided information for improving water protection during ditch network maintenance.

AB Purpose Peatlands have an important role in methane cycling in the natural environment. Methane emissions as a result of methanogenesis and methanotrophy in soil are affected by several environmental factors such as temperature, oxygen and groundwater level. The objective of this study was to analyse methane cycling as a function of soil depth.
   Materials and methods In this study, methane cycling and soil organic matter mineralization were investigated in a drained fen grassland area of Ljubljana marsh, Slovenia that has been subjected to reclamation strategies for several centuries. Potential mineralization, methane production and methane oxidation rates were measured in slurry incubation experiments with soil samples from 10 sampling depths of a 1-m profile. In addition, the extent of iron reduction in the soil was determined.
   Results and discussion The potential for methane production was low in the investigated soil profile, even in constantly flooded layers below the water table fluctuations. During anaerobic incubations, the highest accumulated concentrations and production rates of methane were observed in the upper 10-cm layer and the lowest in deeper soil layers, indicating that plant exudates are the main source of energy for heterotrophic soil microbes and that methanogenesis in deeper layers is limited by the availability of appropriate organic substrates. Methane oxidation was on the other hand active throughout the soil profile, suggesting that the potentially active methane oxidizing community is present despite low methane production. The highest abundance and activity of methanotrophs was detected in the water table fluctuation layers.
   Conclusions Together, these findings have implications for understanding the biogeochemical function of drained peat soils and emphasize the influence of drainage on quality of soil organic matter and consequently on methane production even in flooded soils.

DE ACIDIFICATION; ALKALINITY; CARICION-DAVALLIANAE; RICH FEN
AB The soil chemistry of a headwater valley fen is influenced by local ground water discharge that supplies base cations and alkalinity to the fen.  An irrigation canal just upward of the fen is the source of this alkalinity.  The ecological consequences of this artificial system are studied both on the soil and vegetation level.  Rich-fen species of the alliance Caricion davallianae are connected to soil water alkalinity and soil base status.  They depend directly on the alkaline ground water discharge.  In addition, the local input of this water causes a gradient-rich pattern from poor to rich fen, and it is therefore concluded that it is responsible for the presence of intermediate fen vegetation too.  High nutrient levels in the irrigation water have not influenced the fen until now.  This case study illustrates the possibility for rich fen restoration after acidification.  Irrigation with alkaline water is efficient if excess nutrients can be removed.

AB Similarly to drainage caused by land-use change, the predicted climate warming may cause a moderate water-level drawdown in northern peatlands due to increased evapotranspiration. This is likely to alter the frequency and severity of peatland fires. We surveyed the fire pattern in drainage-affected and unmanaged parts of a boreal raised bog using three sampling transects reaching from drainage-affected area to an unmanaged bog area. Throughout the bog, dry hummock surfaces provided spreading routes for fire while hollows remained intact. Drainage promoted succession that lead to the dominance of hummock vegetation close to the drained area. Consequently, drainage succession favoured fire. The results suggest an increase in fire impact as a consequence of lowered water levels. In warmer climate with increased evapotranspiration bogs are likely to become more vulnerable to fires.

AB Peatland soils store substantial amounts of organic matter (OM). During peat formation, easily decomposable OM is preferentially lost and more recalcitrant moieties accumulate. In a peat profile, OM quality thus scales with depth. Drainage and ongoing climate change poses the risk of rapid OM loss when formerly anoxic peat layers oxidize. During peat decomposition, deeper, more recalcitrant peat is exposed to the oxygen-rich surface, which may influence the decomposition rate. We show that the soil respiration rate of a disturbed temperate peatland is strongly controlled by the peat's quality and especially its polysaccharides content. The polysaccharide content of soil profiles in a wider range of peatland sites with differing degrees of disturbance was inferred by means of solid-state C-13 NMR and DRIFT spectroscopy. The data confirmed a strong decline in polysaccharide content with depth and a poor OM quality of surface peat in soils drained decades ago. We combined the evidence from respiration and spectroscopic measurements to deduce the sensitivity of peatland carbon loss with respect to OM quality by scaling measured quality to a 142-years record of peatland subsidence and carbon loss at one of the sites. According to the functional relationship between quality and respiration, the measured average annual carbon loss rate of 2.5 t C ha(-1) at that site was 20 t C ha(-1) at the onset of peatland drainage and dropped to less than 1 t C ha(-1) in recent times.

AB Peatlands store large amounts of organic carbon, but the carbon stock is sensitive to changes in precipitation or water table manipulations. Restoration of drained peatlands by drain blocking and flooding is a common measure to conserve and augment the carbon stock of peatland soils. Here, we report to what extent flooding affected the contribution of heterotrophic and rhizosphere respiration to soil CO2 efflux in a grass-dominated mountain fen in Germany. Soil CO2 efflux was measured in three un-manipulated control plots and three flooded plots in two consecutive years. Flooding was achieved by permanent irrigation during the growing seasons. Radiocarbon signatures of CO2 from different sources including soil CO2 efflux, incubated peat cores and live grass roots were repeatedly analyzed for partitioning of soil CO2 efflux. Additionally, heterotrophic respiration and its radiocarbon signature were determined by eliminating rhizosphere respiration in trenched subplots (only control). In the control plots, rhizosphere respiration determined by C-14 signatures contributed between 47 and 61% during the growing season, but was small (4 +/- 8%) immediately before budding. Trenching revealed a smaller rhizosphere contribution of 33 +/- 8% (2009) and 22 +/- 9% (2010) during growing seasons.
   Flooding reduced annual soil CO2 efflux of the fen by 42% in 2009 and by 30% in 2010. The reduction was smaller in 2010 mainly through naturally elevated water level in the control plots. A one-week interruption of irrigation caused a strong short-lived increase in soil CO2 efflux, demonstrating the sensitivity of the fen to water table drawdown near the peat surface. The reduction in soil CO2 efflux in the flooded plots diminished the relative proportion of rhizosphere respiration from 56 to 46%, suggesting that rhizosphere respiration was slightly more sensitive to flooding than heterotrophic respiration.

AB Many peatlands have been damaged by human activities like Sphagnum harvesting and draining reflected in reduced peatland areas and ecosystem functioning. Peatlands generally play an important role in global silicon (Si) cycling and maintain huge numbers of testate amoebae (TA). However, there is a lack of knowledge on (i) the quantity of protozoic Si pools (represented by siliceous shells of TA) in peatlands and (ii) how these pools respond to land use changes caused by human influence. In our study, we quantified protozoic Si pools in the Dajiuhu National Wetland Park, China, with a focus on the comparison between peatland and cropland areas (i.e., former peatland drained for agriculture). We found protozoic Si pools to (i) represent an important biogenic silica fraction in peatlands and (ii) significantly differ between peatlands and croplands with soil moisture as a key factor for protozoic Si pool quantity showing a significant decrease of these pools in drained areas (i.e., in croplands). From our results we concluded the decrease of protozoic Si pools due to land-use change to represent another example (apart from the loss of phytogenic Si) for anthropogenic desilication in agricultural biogeosystems in general.

AB [1] If boreal peatlands face drought more often due to climatic warming, the responses of vegetation may drastically change the functions of the ecosystem. We assessed the effects of water-level drawdown on plant-mediated organic matter (OM) and nutrient fluxes in a chronosequence of undrained and drained, originally sparsely treed fens. The chronosequence mimicked the reduced growing season moisture predicted by current climate change scenarios. In a pristine state, OM and nutrient fluxes were characterized by annual cycling through graminoids and mosses. Water-level drawdown initiated a "forest succession, '' in which the OM and nutrient cycles shifted from being dominated by graminoids and mosses to dominance by arboreal vegetation in two decades. Simultaneously, the quantity and tissue type composition of annual litterfall, as well as the quantity and allocation of annual nutrient uptake, changed radically. The changes may have contrasting but as yet unexplored implications for the carbon and nutrient balances of these sites.

AB The present investigation was part of a fen restoration project, which deals with the rehabilitation of a deeply drained peat land used for intensive agriculture for more than 200 years, Consequently, the conditions for restoration are unfavorable. The hay of well-developed fen meadows from nature reserves in the region appeared to contain enough viable seeds to act as a source for the development of target communities when spread out on bare peat after topsoil removal. Repeated vegetation analysis showed that a combination of topsoil removal and hay transfer resulted in the establishment of new populations in the target area for 70% of the species of the donor area. Germination conditions of fen species were investigated to determine the optimal combination for stimulating germination rates. Most fen species were found to be dormant, and it was shown that dormancy could be broken with fluctuating light and temperature cycles and stratification pre-treatment.

AB Peatlands drained for forestry have a high potential for CO2 emissions due to peat decomposition. Accurate estimates of either these emissions or soil carbon balances (Delta C-soil) on large areas are needed for national greenhouse gas inventories and as input for earth system models. The measurement of forest floor respiration (R-floor) or heterotrophic soil respiration (R-het) by portable chambers offers an affordable tool for extensive studies. So far, the reliability of respiration chamber based calculations of Delta C-soil, has not been tested and the prerequisites for their use have not been discussed. However, the method is being used in greenhouse gas inventories.
   In this study, we compared the results of two chamber based methods against a reference estimate based on eddy covariance measurements. In the first method, Delta C-soil was calculated by subtracting R-het from the litter input into the soil. In the second method, R floor was subtracted from the entire allocation of carbon (C) into the soil. A four-year detailed dataset of C dynamics of a drained peatland forest in southern Finland served as the test material.
   The R-het method produced results close to those of the reference method, but the results were sensitive to the choice of root turnover rates used in the estimation of litter input. The R-floor method resulted in a clear underestimation of soil C sink: the accurate estimation of the large photosynthesis and respiration fluxes needed for the calculation turned out to be difficult.
   In our opinion, the R-het method could be used to identify hot spots of forest soil CO2 emissions and for balance estimation for large areas. Further development of models for estimating the photosynthesis and respiration fluxes is needed for the application of the R-floor method. As the estimation of Delta C-soil by subtracting C output from C input is inherently sensitive to bias in the estimation of the input and output, the accuracy of both methods needs further testing with extensive datasets.

AB We studied ant assembly changes after ditching of bogs with nest and pitfall sampling in the southern Finnish taiga. The study sites clustered in dendrograms to hierarchical sets: virgin bogs and young ditchings, older ditchings, and forests. Species richness was low on virgin bogs and young ditchings, and increased with the age of ditching. The number of species was highest in clearcut, and decreased in spruce forests with increasing density of wood ants. Three bog specialists, Formica uralensis, F. picea and Myrmica scabrinodis, were found only on bogs. Nation-wide draining of bogs implies severe decreases in their population densities. As a corollary, the poorly known but potentially healthy populations of the obligate social parasite of M. scabrinodis, Myrmica karavajevi, may go extinct in extensive regions, because of its need of high nest densities of the host species. The effects of habitat attributes on the local number of species were overshadowed by top-dominant, polydomous wood ants. A wood with practically no F. aquilonia harboured 11 other ant species, whereas in high-density wood-ant forest only two other species were located. Pre-emption by the slave-maker F. sanguinea may in several ways slow down the spread of wood ants to ditched bogs.

AB A considerable proportion of boreal mires have been drained for soil amelioration purposes. In response to drainage-induced degradation, restoration practices have been implemented in recent decades. Restoration by raising the water level is often followed by changes in the quality of runoff waters, especially in concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (total P, PO4-P). We studied how mire restoration affected bacterial production (BP), bacterial growth efficiency (BGE%) and respiration (R) in mire runoff waters from spruce swamps and Sphagnum pine bogs in south-central Finland. The quality of runoff water was monitored for 8 years (2008-2015) and bacterial activity was measured during 3 years (2010-2012) at runoff weir sites, including two pristine controls, one drained control and four treatment sites. The concentrations of DOC, N and P increased for 3-5 years after restoration. The increased availability of nutrients was followed by doubled BP (from ca. 0.34 to 0.88 mu mol C L-1 d(-1), averages of restored sites) and BGE% (from ca. 2.7 to 9.2%), whereas microbial respiration was only slightly increased. However, bacterial activity in mire waters was low compared with those generally measured in river and lake waters. This was presumably related to the recalcitrant quality of the mireoriginated DOC, which was not clearly influenced by restoration. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) of low bioavailability contributes to browning of headwaters. As our study was focused only on short-term (1-5 years) effects, more research is needed for evaluating long-term impacts of peatland origin DOM on carbon fluxes, microbial activity and food webs of recipient aquatic ecosystems.

AB Peat moss in drained peatlands has become a non-negligible source of greenhouse gases (GHG) emission. Pyrolysis is a potential technique to convert carbon-emitting peat moss to carbon-storage materials. This work investigates the behavior of peat moss pyrolysis by a combined in-situ thermal analysis and bench-scale pyrolysis experiment methodology. The simultaneous thermal analyzer, which provides the simultaneous TG/DTA analysis, was employed to reveal the thermal decomposition behavior of peat moss. The samples were heated up to 900 degrees C with different heating rates of 10, 15, and 20 degrees C/min. Thereafter, pyrolysis experiments with peak temperatures of 450, 500, 550 and 600 degrees C were performed in a bench-scale pyrolyzer. It was found that there are four main stages and two micro stages of mass loss during peat moss pyrolysis from room temperature to 900 degrees C. Also, kinetic parameters were calculated based on the results of TG and DTG by the Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) method and the Coats-Redfern (CR) method. In the bench-scale pyrolysis experiments, four phases, i.e., char, tar, aqueous phase, and gas, were obtained and characterized. The carbon distribution and the GHG emission from peat moss pyrolysis were determined.

AB The natural carbon storage function of peatland ecosystems can be severely affected by the abandonment of peat extraction, influencing peatland drainage, leading to large and persistent sources of atmospheric CO2. Moreover, these cutover peatlands have a low and variable water table position and high tension at the surface, creating harsh ecohydrological conditions for vegetation re-establishment, particularly peat forming Sphagnum moss. Standard restoration techniques aim to restore the peatland to a carbon accumulating system through various water management techniques to improve hydrological conditions and by reintroducing Sphagnum at the surface. However, restoring the hydrology of peatlands can be expensive due to the cost of implementing the various restoration techniques. This study examines a peat extraction-restoration technique where the acrotelm is preserved and replaced directly on the cutover peat surface. An experimental peatland adopting this acrotelm transplant technique had both a high water table and peat moisture conditions providing sufficient water at the surface for Sphagnum moss. Average water table conditions were higher at the experimental site (-8.4 +/- 4.2 cm) compared to an adjacent natural site (-12.7 +/- 6.0 cm) suggesting adequate moisture conditions at the restored surface. However, the experimental site experienced high variability in volumetric moisture content (VMC) in the capitula zone (upper 2 cm) where large diurnal changes in VMC (similar to 30%) were observed, suggesting possible disturbance to the peat matrix structure during the extraction-restoration process. However, soil-water retention analysis and physical peat properties (porosity and bulk density) suggest that no significant differences existed between the natural and experimental sites. Any structural changes within the peat matrix were therefore minimal. Moreover, low soil-water tensions were maintained well above the laboratory measured critical Sphagnum threshold of 33% (-100 mb) VMC, further indicating favourable conditions for Sphagnum moss survival and growth.

AB We conducted greenhouse microcosm experiments to examine the biogeochemical effects of restoring seawater to historically diked Cape Cod salt marshes. Feat cores from both seasonally flooded and drained diked marshes were waterlogged with seawater, and porewater chemistry was subsequently monitored for 21 mo. The addition of seawater to highly organic, seasonally flooded peat caused the death of freshwater wetland plants, 6-8 cm of sediment subsidence, and increased N and P mineralization. Also, sulfides and alkalinity increased 10-fold, suggesting accelerated decomposition by sulfate reduction. Addition of seawater to the low-organic-content acidic peat from the drained marsh increased porewater pH, alkalinity, PO4-P, and Fe(II), which we attribute to the reestablishment of SO4 and Fe(III) mineral reduction. Increased cation exchange contributed to 6-fold increases in dissolved Fe(II) and Al and 60-fold increases in NH4-N within 6 mo of salination.
   Seawater reintroductions to seasonally flooded diked marshes will cause porewater sulfides to increase, likely reducing the success of revegetation efforts. Sulfide toxicity is of less concern in resalinated drained peats because of the abundance of Fe(II) to precipitate sulfides, and of NH4-N to offset sulfide inhibition of N uptake. Restoration of either seasonally flooded or drained diked marshes could stimulate potentially large nutrient and Fe(II) releases, which could in turn increase primary production and lower oxygen in receiving waters. These findings suggest that tidal restoration be gradual and carefully monitored.

AB A site-productivity model for Norway spruce on fen peat in central Ireland was derived by stepwise regression of measured soil data on yield class (the expected maximum mean annual volume increment for the crop, expressed in cubic metres per annum per hectare). Soil C/N ratio, soil air space and hydrogen ion concentration explained 73% of the observed variation in yield class. The results indicated that the yield class of Norway spruce on fen was correlated with the physical properties of the peat and that, assuming adequate inputs of P and K, this species will be most productive on poorly decomposed, well-drained fen which exhibits a botanical composition indicative of relatively poor nutrition at the time of peat formation.

AB Acetylene, dimethyl ether (DME) and 2-chloro-6-trichloromethyl pyridine (nitrapyrin) were used as inhibitors to study the contributions of nitrification and denitrification to the production of N2O and nitric oxide (NO) in samples taken from the soil profile of a peatland drained for forestry. Acetylene and DME inhibited 60-100% of the nitrification activity in field-moist samples from the 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm peat layers, whereas nitrapyrin had no inhibitory effect. In the 0-5 cm peat layer the N2O production could be reduced by up to 90% with inhibitors of nitrification, but in the 5-10 cm peat layer this proportion was 20-30%. All the inhibitors removed 96-100% of the nitrification potential in peat-water slurries from the 0-5 cm peat layer, but the 5-10 cm layer had a much lower nitrification activity, and here the efficiency of the inhibitors was more variable. Litter was the main net source of NO in the peat profile. NO3- production was lower in the litter layer than in the peat, whereas N2O production was much higher in the litter than in the peat. Denitrification was the most probable source of N2O and NO in the litter, which had a high availability of organic substrates.

AB 1] Peatland drainage and peat extraction changes natural peatlands from a net carbon sink to that of a large net source due to increased respiration and the removal of carbon dioxide ( CO(2)) fixing vegetation. Restoration of these altered peatland ecosystems is being applied to reduce these carbon emissions. As peatland restoration is a new and emerging land-use management practice, the purpose of this research was to examine the impact of restoration on the methane ( CH(4)) component of the carbon cycle at the Bois-des-Bel peatland located near Riviere-du-Loup, Quebec from early May to mid October for several years. The seasonal CH(4) fluxes prior to restoration at an extracted ( cutover) and a restored peatland were not significantly different from each other or zero. However, three years postrestoration the seasonal CH(4) emissions at the restored site were 4.2 g m(-2) CH(4) season(-1), 4.6 times greater than the cutover site. Ponds and ditches at the restored site were seasonal CH(4) emission hot spots ( 0.3 and 2.9 g m(-2) CH(4) season(-1), respectively); however, emissions from herbaceous vegetation ( 1.0 g m(-2) CH(4) season(-1)) were the dominant source of CH(4) from the restored peatland due to its large areal extent. CH(4) fluxes from the Bois-des-Bel peatland represented 14% of the total CO(2)-equivalent losses from the site. This study demonstrates the importance of vegetation succession on peatland-atmosphere flux of CH(4).

AB The effects of wood ash application on soil microbial processes were investigated in three drained forested peatlands, which differed in nutrient status and time since application. Measured variables included the concentrations of soil elements and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), net nitrogen (N) mineralization, nitrification and denitrification enzyme activity, potential methane (CH4) oxidation, CH4 production and microbial respiration kinetics. Wood ash application had a considerable influence on soil element concentrations. This mirrored a decrease in the majority of the microbial biomarkers by more than one-third in the two oligotrophic peatlands, although the microbial community composition was not altered. The decreases in PLFAs coincided with reduced net ammonification and net N mineralization. Other measured variables did not change systematically as a result of wood ash application. No significant changes in microbial biomass or processes were found in the mesotrophic peatland, possibly because too little time (1 year) had elapsed since the wood ash application. This study suggests that oligotrophic peatlands can be substantially affected by wood ash for a period of at least 4 years after application. However, within 25 years of the wood ash application, the microbial biomass seemed to have recovered or adapted to enhanced element concentrations in the soil.

AB Peatlands drained for agriculture are sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Resulting emissions may depend on land-use, often as grassland or cropland, but few studies have directly compared the effects of land-uses. Here, we measured annual emissions of CO2, N2O and methane (CH4) from five sites in a temperate bog, representing an undrained natural bog (NB) site, and four drained sites used as permanent grassland (PG) and croplands with rotations of oat-potato, oat-spring barley and potato-spring barley (PO:SB) in the study year. Gas fluxes were measured at 1-2 week intervals using static chambers, and auxiliary data were obtained, such as temperature, depth of water table, ratio-vegetation index, pH and soil mineral N. Annual CO2 emissions were derived from empirical modelling, whereas CH4 and N2O emissions were linearly interpolated between measurement dates by bootstrapping. Soil respiration was lower at the NB site (1.8 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1)) than at the drained sites where emissions were in the range of 5.0-8.8 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1). The N2O emission was negligible at NB (0.3 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)), low at three of the drained sites (1.5-3.7 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)), but high at PO:SB (37.7 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)). The CH4 emission was high at NB (172 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1)), but negligible at the drained sites (-1.5 to 1.5 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1)). The soil respiration at the drained sites indicated that peat losses were rather similar among the different cropping systems and depended mostly on drainage status, although soil respiration and peat mineralization may not scale directly. The pattern of N2O emissions suggested an increased risk of N2O emission from potato cultivation before and after the period of potato growth, likely due to microbial availability of NO3- outside the growing season. For initiatives aiming at reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural peat soils, this means that, e.g., conversion from cropland to permanent grassland should preferably be accompanied by measures of rewetting, whereas for potato cropping, N availability outside the growing season should be minimized.

TI Reserves of soil nitrogen in drained peat soils of the European north
   and their need in nitric fertilizers
SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Annual mobilization of soil nitrogen in peat soils varies from 60-120 to 300-350 kg/ha. The need in nitric fertilizers varies from very high to low when compared with the need in phosphorous and potassium fertilizers. In some cases, the lowest rates of nitrogen are required. During the initial stages of cultivation and agricultural development of peat soils, the reserves of soil nitrogen may play the main role in nutrition of plants. After 35-50 years of cultivation, natural reserves of nitrogen in peat soils decrease significantly, and the role of nitric fertilizers rises. At present, there is a great need in nitric fertilizers, and it will increase in the future.

AB Black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.) occurs naturally in temperate marshes and in minerotrophic peatlands and is also suitable for paludiculture - the cultivation of biomass on wet or rewetted peatland. We investigated the effect of a newly established black alder plantation on the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of a degraded fen in north-eastern Germany over a two-year period (August 2010-August 2012). We compared the alder plantation (A(wet)) with an extensively used meadow (M-wet) and a drier reference meadow (M-moist). GHG fluxes were measured monthly to bi-monthly using the closed chamber method. Our results show that A(wet) was a slight net GHG (in CO2-eq) sink of -3.4 +/- 1.7 t ha(-1) yr(-1), M-wet was a moderate net GHG source of 9.6 +/- 1.2 t ha(-1) yr(-1), and M-wet was a strong net GHG source of 24.5 +/- 1.6 t ha(-1) yr(-1). This was mainly driven by CO2 uptake at the two very moist (wet) sites and by high CO2 release at the drier reference site. A(wet) was a larger CO2 sink than M-wet, probably due to additional CO2 uptake by the alder stand at A(wet) and carbon export in plant material harvested from A(wet). All sites were significant CH4 sources. Substantial CH4 emission peaks were observed at all sites following extraordinarily heavy precipitation during the summer of 2011, which accounted for up to 70 % of the accumulated two-year CH4 emissions. However, the A(wet) site generally emitted less CH4, possibly due to the effective oxygen transport mechanism in black alders. N2O emissions were negligible at all three sites. Our results indicate that the GHG balances of formerly drained fens benefit in the short term from planting of black alders, mostly due to reduced CH4 emissions. This study highlights the importance of acknowledging extreme precipitation events and groundwater fluctuations for the derivation of reliable GHG emission factors.

TI Dynamic C and N stocks - key factors controlling the C gas exchange of
   maize in heterogenous peatland

AB The drainage and cultivation of fen peatlands create complex small-scale mosaics of soils with extremely variable soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and groundwater levels (GWLs). To date, the significance of such sites as sources or sinks for greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 is still unclear, especially if the sites are used for cropland. As individual control factors such as GWL fail to account for this complexity, holistic approaches combining gas fluxes with the underlying processes are required to understand the carbon (C) gas exchange of drained fens. It can be assumed that the stocks of SOC and N located above the variable GWL - defined as dynamic C and N stocks - play a key role in the regulation of the plant- and microbially mediated CO2 fluxes in these soils and, inversely, for CH4. To test this assumption, the present study analysed the C gas exchange (gross primary production - GPP; ecosystem respiration - R-eco; net ecosystem exchange - NEE; CH4) of maize using manual chambers for 4 years. The study sites were located near Paulinenaue, Germany, where we selected three soil types representing the full gradient of GWL and SOC stocks (0-1 m) of the landscape: (a) Haplic Arenosol (AR; 8 kg C m(-2)); (b) Mollic Gleysol (GL; 38 kg C m(-2)); and (c) Hemic Histosol (HS; 87 kg C m(-2)). Daily GWL data were used to calculate dynamic SOC (SOCdyn) and N (N-dyn) stocks.
   Average annual NEE differed considerably among sites, ranging from 47 +/- 30 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in AR to -305 +/- 123 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in GL and -127 +/- 212 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in HS. While static SOC and N stocks showed no significant effect on C fluxes, SOCdyn and N-dyn and their interaction with GWL strongly influenced the C gas exchange, particularly NEE and the GPP : R-eco ratio. Moreover, based on nonlinear regression analysis, 86% of NEE variability was explained by GWL and SOCdyn. The observed high relevance of dynamic SOC and N stocks in the aerobic zone for plant and soil gas exchange likely originates from the effects of GWL-dependent N availability on C formation and transformation processes in the plant-soil system, which promote CO2 input via GPP more than CO2 emission via R-eco.
   The process-oriented approach of dynamic C and N stocks is a promising, potentially generalisable method for system-oriented investigations of the C gas exchange of groundwater-influenced soils and could be expanded to other nutrients and soil characteristics. However, in order to assess the climate impact of arable sites on drained peatlands, it is always necessary to consider the entire range of groundwater-influenced mineral and organic soils and their respective areal extent within the soil landscape.

AB In boreal forest, drainage can be successfully used to lower the water-table level of postharvest forested peatland stands suffering from watering-up. The later vegetation revival and growth is suspected to gradually create a water-table drawdown described in this study as biological drainage. Its effect on the annual stump diameter increment of planted eastern larch (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch) and naturally regenerated black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) was studied on a postharvested and drained forested peatland located in eastern part of the Canadian boreal forest. A factor describing the neighbourhood occupancy of every subject tree was used to illustrate biological drainage in a retrospective growth analysis. Results showed the dual effect of the neighbourhood occupancy factor: competing situations close to the ditch and growth-favouring situations farther from it. In the latter case, the studied trees demonstrated better growth with moderately increasing neighbourhood occupancy. This was interpreted as evidence of the beneficial effect of biological drainage on tree growth. The presence of speckled alder (Alnus incana subsp.rugosa (Du Roi) J. Clausen) in the neighbourhood of selected trees corresponded to improved growth for both studied species.

AB Deposition of nitrogen is assumed to cause loss of botanical diversity, probably through increased production and exclusion of less competitive species. However, if production is (co-)limited by phosphorus, acceleration of the phosphorus cycle may be responsible for the diversity loss and, where that is the case, nitrogen emission reduction may turn out to be an ineffective mitigation strategy. Here we study the feasibility of this mechanism through adding potassium and phosphorus to grassland where nitrogen limitation is absent.
   We made vegetation relev,s in a long-term agricultural fertilisation experiment where potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen were being added to grassland on drained peat where nitrogen availability was high, even in unfertilised plots. We applied a multivariate analysis to investigate the effect of additions of K, K + P and K + P + N on the species composition.
   Unfertilised plots had a very low biomass production and were rich in plant species despite their high nitrogen availability. Addition of potassium led to a strongly increased production but did not result in a reduction of species numbers. Phosphorus in addition to potassium increased production still further and decreased species numbers, most notably the number of endangered species.
   Even under nitrogen rich conditions species richness may be high in grasslands where phosphorous provides a limitation to plant growth. Phosphorus limitation and phosphorus enrichment are both common in grassland, at least in north-western Europe. Part of the general decrease in species numbers that is commonly ascribed to nitrogen enrichment may therefore be due to phosphorus enrichment. If phosphorus and nitrogen are co-limiting (which is often the case) the current nitrogen emission reduction policies may be effective, but not sufficient to restore grassland diversity to its pre-industrial level.

AB Large peatland complexes dominate the landscape of the James Bay Lowland in subarctic Ontario, Canada. However, there is not a thorough understanding of the hydrological processes occurring in these important systems, particularly how ladder fens connect large domed bogs to the aquatic ecosystems that drain the peatland complex. Ladder fens consist of a pool-rib topography where flow downgradient is controlled by the peat ribs. Within the ribs, low-lying preferential flow paths typically enhance the transmission of water, whereas the elevated ridge microforms impede water flow to downgradient aquatic ecosystems. To assess the hydrological connectivity, we study the role of the water table, peat transmissivity, and microtopography of a small ladder fen for 3 summers (2013-2015) in the James Bay Lowland. The system was manipulated with a sustained hydrological forcing (water addition) to the upslope boundary of the fen during 2014 (38 m(3)/day) and 2015 (30 m(3)/day). There was an exponential increase in transmissivity towards the peat surface due to extremely high-hydraulic conductivities within the upper few centimeters of the peat deposit. At the maximum water table, the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the 0.1 m layer of peat below the water table varied depending on peat microtopography (preferential flow paths = 42-598 m/day and ridges = 16-52 m/day), resulting in high-hydrological connectivity periods. Furthermore, during 2015, there was an abnormally large amount of precipitation (300 mm vs. long-term average similar to 100 mm) that resulted in complete surface water connectivity of the site. This caused rapid movement of water from the head of system to the outlet ( similar to 15 hr) and runoff ratios >1, compared to low-water table periods (runoff ratio similar to 0.05). This study highlights the profound importance of the transmissivity-water table feedback mechanism in ladder fens, on controlling the water retention and drainage of large peatland complexes.

AB Many studies have focused on the effects of anthropogenic habitat alterations on animals, but little attention has been given to the effects of natural changes in habitat. The purpose of our study was to examine the effects of flooding caused by Beaver (Castor canadensis) dams on the spatial ecology of the federally endangered Spotted Turtle (Clemmys guttata), in a bog in Ontario that was historically drained for peat extraction. We hypothesized that home range sizes and daily distances traveled would be greater after flooding and that habitat selection would change because turtles would exploit the increase in aquatic habitats post-flooding. Using 12 years of mark-recapture data, radio telemetry, and US software, we compared movements and habitat selection before and after flooding. Distances traveled and home range sizes were larger post-flood compared to pre-flood conditions, indicating that turtles were opportunistically exploring the new aquatic habitat. During pre-flooding, turtles primarily selected the drainage ditches created to facilitate peat extraction; these were the only aquatic habitat available. After flooding, there was a strong preference for newly flooded areas and drainage ditches, showing that turtles exploited the increase in available aquatic habitat. Our findings indicate that natural habitat alteration resulting from Beaver dam flooding may be beneficial for Spotted Turtles, although observations also suggest that nesting habitat may be limited due to the flooding, and further research is needed to determine the effect of the flooding on recruitment into the population.

AB It is shown that, for growing crops on the drained peat soils of northern Russia in Europe, mixing sand with them and especially adding a layer of sand on the surface have multiple beneficial effects on the properties of these soils as well as on the environmental conditions within them. These measures have significantly improved temperatures in the organogenic soils, raising temperatures in the surface horizons by 2-4 degrees C in the growing reason, advancing the date of soil thawing in the spring (by as much as 15 days), and reducing the likelihood of surface frosts. A substantial improvement in crop yield was demonstrated (especially for potatoes) as well as suppression of weeds in cover crops.

DE Cultivated peatlands; Drainage; WTL; CO2 CH4; BASGRA-BGC model
AB Cultivated peatlands under drainage practices contribute significant carbon losses from agricultural sector in the Nordic countries. In this research, we developed the BASGRA-BGC model coupled with hydrological, soil carbon decomposition and methane modules to simulate the dynamic of water table level (WTL), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions for cultivated peatlands. The field measurements from four experimental sites in Finland, Denmark and Norway were used to validate the predictive skills of this novel model under different WTL management practices, climatic conditions and soil properties. Compared with daily observations, the model performed well in terms of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error; 0.06-0.11 m, 1.22-2.43 gC/m(2)/day, and 0.002-0.330 kgC/ha/day for WTL, CO2 and CH4, respectively), NRMSE (Normalized Root Mean Square Error; 10.3-18.3%, 13.0-18.6%, 15.3-21.9%) and Pearson's r (Pearson correlation coefficient; 0.60-0.91, 0.76-0.88, 0.33-0.80). The daily/ seasonal variabilities were therefore captured and the aggregated results corresponded well with annual estimations. We further provided an example on the model's potential use in improving the WTL management to mitigate CO2 and CH4 emissions while maintaining grass production. At all study sites, the simulatedWTLs and carbon decomposition rates showed a significant negative correlation. Therefore, controlling WTL could effectively reduce carbon losses. However, given the highly diverse carbon decomposition rates within individual WTLs, adding indicators (e.g. soil moisture and peat quality) would improve our capacity to assess the effectiveness of specific mitigation practices such as WTL control and rewetting.

AB The results of studies are presented for the elemental composition of peat from the Ilas ombrotrophic bog (White Sea drainage basin). The calculations of enrichment factors of trace elements over the section of the bog peat relatively to the average composition of the Earth's continental crust showed that the concentrations of most of chemical elements is determined by the contributions of lithogenic and biogenic sources, and the content of trace elements is equal to the background level. Enrichment growth since the beginning of intense development of European industry until the early 21th century was revealed only for Zn, Sb, Pb, and Cd. These elements were supplied to the bog resulting from long-range air transport and precipitation from the atmosphere. No pronounced heavy-metal contamination caused by the Arkhangelsk agglomeration was revealed for the peat in the Ilas bog.

AB To date there is still a lack of reliable data on greenhouse gas emissions from drained fens needed to determine the climatic relevance of land use and land use change on peatlands and to supply the National Inventory Report for the German Greenhouse Gas Inventory. In this study we present the results of monthly-based multiyear measurements of CO2, N2O and CH4 flux rates in two drained agriculturally used fen ecosystems in NW Germany (cropland and grassland) over a period of 4.5 y using transparent and opaque closed chambers. CO2 exchange was modelled at high resolution with temperature and photosynthetic active radiation. The measured and modelled values fit very well (R-2 >= 0.93). Annual GHG and Global Warming Potential (GWP) balances were determined. Net CO2 emissions at the cropland and grassland sites were similarly high, taking into account changes in management; net ecosystem C balance amounted to about 4.0 to 5.0 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1). Emissions of N2O and CH4 were low at both sites. The mean GWP balance for a time frame of 100 y (GWP100) amounted to about 17.0 to 19.0 Mg CO2-eq. ha(-1) y(-1). The unexpectedly low greenhouse gas emissions from the cropland site are attributed to the high water table and a change in crop management. The change from corn for silage to corn-cob mix lead transiently to rather small greenhouse gas emissions. The study confirms the need for multiyear measurements taking climatic and management variation into account.

AB Downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) stands on drained peatlands are often considered useless because they typically do not yield good-quality sawn timber. However, covering an area of ca. 0.5 million hectares and with total yields of up to 250 m(3)ha(-1), downy birch stands on peatlands in Finland have a potential for pulpwood and/or energy wood production. We examined the financial performance of alternative management regimes (with or without thinnings, different thinning intensities, several rotation lengths) combined with alternative harvesting methods (pulpwood, energy wood, or integrated, energy wood being delimbed stems or whole trees). We used data from 19 experimental stands, monitored for 20-30 years. For harvesting removals we considered both actual thinning removals and final-cutting removals with alternative timings that were based on the monitoring data. We assessed the profitability as a combination of the net present value of the birch generation and the bare land value of future generations of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). The most profitable management was growing without thinnings until wholetree final cutting at the stand age of 40-45 years with an advanced multi-tree harvesting method. In contrast, the standard method in whole-tree final cutting resulted in the lowest profitability, and an integrated method with the energy wood as delimbed stems was the best of the standard methods. Thinnings were unprofitable especially when aiming to produce energy wood, whereas aiming for pulpwood, light precommercial thinning was competitive. Commercial thinning at the traditional " pulpwood stage" had little effect on profitability. The best stand age for final cutting was 40-65 years - earlier for very dense stands and whole-tree energy wood harvesting with advanced method, later for precommercially thinned stands and pulpwood harvesting.

AB Erosion from peat extraction areas is known to cause siltation of water courses and poor water quality. However, the main soil parameters affecting peat erosion and suspended sediment (SS) yields from different catchments are not well understood. This paper used peat properties (degree of humification, peat type, ash content, porosity, moisture content, bulk density, and shear strength) and novel erosion threshold measurements from intact soil cores to explain peat erodibility and spatial variations in SS concentrations (SSCs) and SS loads (SSLs) at 20 Finnish peat extraction sites. The erosion threshold measurements suggested that critical shear stresses for particle entrainment decrease with increasing degree of humification (von Post scale) and are significantly lower in well-decomposed peat than in slightly or moderately decomposed peat. Two critical shear stresses were obtained from moderately decomposed peat samples, indicating a degree of surface armoring by coarse peat fibers. Monitored long-term average SSC was highest at study sites with well-decomposed peat, while very fine-grained mineral subsoil explained some of the highest long-term SSC in areas where drainage ditches penetrated below the upper peat layer. Average SSL (kg d(-1)) at the study sites was best explained (R-2=0.89) by average discharge and surface peat decomposition level. Overall, this study provides new knowledge on peat erosion and critical shear stresses that can be used in water conservation and sediment management practices for cutover peatlands and other similar land uses.

AB Mined peatlands do not readily recover their hydrological function, mainly because the dominant peat-forming plant genus, Sphagnum, cannot easily reestablish on the degraded surface peat found on cutover sites. Drainage and removal of the acrotelm can result in surface subsidence of up to 3.7 cm y(-1) m(-1) of peat shortly after drainage (compression), and long-term rates up to 0.3 cm y(-1) m(-1) (compression and oxidation). This can decrease the hydraulic conductivity by over 75%, and decrease the water retention capacity and specific yield. In old abandoned systems, drainage ditches may continue to facilitate a significant seasonal water loss. Colonization of abandoned sites by trees may increase the evapotranspirative losses by as much as 25%, and interception losses can be as high as 32% of rainfall. Without natural or planned occlusion of ditches, some peatlands become drier over time. Blocking ditchesmay largely restore water balance components, although the hydrological regime requires years to stabilise sufficiently for Sphagnum recolonization, especially where residual peat is well decomposed, having inadequate water storage capacity. Consequently, winter precipitation (Europe) and spring snowmelt (North America) are critical recharge periods. Over the long term, consolidation of the peat due to drainage and methane production (where drainage systems are blocked and soils reflooded) decreases hydraulic conductivity, thereby reducing lateral seepage losses. This may actually assist in Sphagnum recolonization. A regenerated cover of Sphagnum increases soil wetness and reduces water tension (increases pore-water pressure) in the substrate, thus ameliorating its own environment. However, natural recolonization and recovery of many hydrological and ecological processes may not occur, or may require many decades. Water management and selective plant reintroduction can accelerate this. Water management options such as blocking ditches, constructing bunds, reconfiguring the surface and managing microclimate havemet with varying degrees of success. No standard management prescription can be made because each site presents unique challenges.

AB We used variation partitioning to assess the relative importance of drainage, climate and local vegetation composition for the development of a raised bog. As a case study we selected Teici (Teici) Bog in Latvia (north-east Europe). Explanatory variables together explained 74 % of the variation in peat accumulation and only the residue of 26 % remained unexplained. Our study showed that the local vegetation composition and dominant Sphagnum species significantly influence peat accumulation rates. The results of linear models revealed that, under natural conditions, minor drainage and even strong drainage of the peat is associated with a positive growth balance of the system. However, drainage systems can have a measurable impact on peatland ecosystems situated farther away. Our study demonstrates that the average peat accumulation rate in Teici Bog over the last 150 years was 3.5 mm per year. Although the peat accumulation rate has been affected by drainage over the last half-century, it is still 2.8 mm per year. There was no strong correlation with the historical climate record, suggesting that the bog area has buffered the influence of climate change over the last 150 years.

AB Peatlands are common in many parts of the world. Draining and other changes in the use of peatlands increase atmospheric CO2 concentration. If we are to make reliable quantitative predictions of that effect, we need good information on the CO2 emission rates from peatlands. The present study uses two different methods for predicting CO2-C release of peatland soils: (i) a 40-year field investigation of balancing organic carbon stocks and (ii) short-term CO2-C release rates from laboratory experiments. To estimate long-term losses of peat, and its resulting C input to the atmosphere, we combined highly detailed maps of surface topography and its changes, and the organic C contents and bulk densities of a drained peatland from different years. Short-term CO2-C release rates were measured in the laboratory by incubating soil samples from several soil horizons at various temperatures and soil moistures. We then derived nonlinear CO2-C production functions, which we incorporated into a numerical simulation model (HYDRUS). Using HYDRUS, we calculated daily soil water components and CO2-release for (i) real-climate data from 1950 to 2003 and (ii) a climate scenario extending to 2050, including an increase in temperature of 2 degrees C and 20% less rainfall during the summer half year, i.e. from April to September inclusive. From our field measurements, we found a mean annual decrease of 0.7 cm in the thickness of the peat. Large losses (> 1.5 cm year(-1)) occurred only during periods when groundwater levels were low (i.e. a deep water-table). The annual CO2-C release results in a mean loss from the peat of about 700 g CO2-C m(-2), mostly as a direct contribution to the atmosphere. Both methods produced very similar results. The model scenarios demonstrated that CO2-C loss is mainly controlled by the groundwater (i.e. water-table) depth, which controls subsurface aeration. A local climate scenario estimated a c. 5% increase of CO2-C losses within the next 50 years.

AB Rotation forestry including clearcutting is a common method of practising forestry in Fennoscandia. Clearcutting in peatland forests markedly increases environmental loading: leaching of nutrients and methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from soil. Continuous cover forestry has been suggested as an alternative because it does not include clearcutting but partial harvesting. However, impacts of partial harvesting on greenhouse gas fluxes are not well understood and in peatlands have not been studied at all. We conducted a partial harvest by removing 70% of the total stem volume in a mature nutrient-rich peatland forest in Southern Finland. The aim was to investigate how partial harvesting a peatland forest affects CH4 and N2O balances, and how much different surface types contribute to the balances. We used automatic and manual chamber methods to measure fluxes from both harvest and uncut control site. Fluxes were measured from the forest floor, logging trails, and ditches. Fluxes from these surface types were upscaled to obtain net ecosystem-level fluxes during two postharvest summers (June-August 2016 and 2017). After the harvest, forest floor CH4 fluxes did not change significantly at the harvested site compared to the control site. However, fluxes at logging trails increased significantly. N2O fluxes increased at the harvest site in the post-harvest years, but so did those at the control site as well. Upscaling CH4 fluxes to ecosystem-level indicated that despite their small area (2.4%), emissions from ditches could be large on ecosystem-scale, but their uncertainty was high, while the logging trail CH4 fluxes (20% of the total area) were small. In contrast, N2O fluxes from ditches were low, but the logging trail fluxes comprised 35-38% of the total surface balance. The overall conclusion is that partial harvesting did not cause considerable changes in CH4 and N2O fluxes from a forestry-drained peatland.

AB Catchments draining peat soils provide the majority of drinking water in the UK. Over the past decades, concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) have increased in surface waters. Residual DOC can cause harmful carcinogenic disinfection by-products to form during water treatment processes. Increased frequency and severity of droughts combined with and increased temperatures expected as the climate changes, have potentials to change water quality. We used a novel approach to investigate links between climate change, DOC release and subsequent effects on drinking water treatment. We designed a climate manipulation experiment to simulate projected climate changes and monitored releases from peat soil and litter, then simulated coagulation used in water treatment. We showed that the 'drought' simulation was the dominant factor altering DOC release and affected the ability to remove DOC. Our results imply that future short-term drought events could have a greater impact than increased temperature on DOC treatability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Northern peat soils are both sources and sinks of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). These fluxes are regulated by the activity of microbial communities. Temporal, spatial and depth related differences in potential activity and composition of the denitrifier and methanotrophic bacterial communities were compared between winter and summer in relation to in situ fluxes of N2O and CH4 from a drained and forested peat land in Sweden. The composition of the genetic pool of these guilds was assessed using terminal fragment length polymorphism analysis of signature genes in the denitrification and methane oxidation pathways, respectively. The composition of the communities was similar throughout the soil profile, although both denitrification and methane oxidation rates decreased with soil depth. The potential methane oxidation rates were significantly correlated to soil N content, and , indicating a nitrogen induced stimulation of methane oxidation capacity. The site was a source of N2O and a small sink for CH4, and although the fluxes did not vary significantly over time, both the methane oxidizing and denitrifier community composition exhibited temporal patterns. Differences in the composition of the methanotrophic community reflected that the peat site shifted from a summer to a winter community. The denitrifiers exhibited a similar trend, but also differed significantly between the sampling occasions during summer, as well as between locations at the site. The latter was explained by differences in soil pH. It was only the differences in the methane oxidizer community composition that correlated with its corresponding potential activity, which implies a higher degree of functional redundancy within the denitrifier community.

AB Peat soils are heterogeneous, anisotropic porous media. Compared to mineral soils, there is still limited understanding of physical and solute transport properties of fen peat soils. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of soil anisotropy on solute transport in degraded fen peat. Undisturbed soil cores, taken in vertical and horizontal direction, were collected from one drained and one restored fen peatland both in a comparable state of soil degradation. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K- s) and chemical properties of peat were determined for all soil cores. Miscible displacement experiments were conducted under saturated steady state conditions using potassium bromide as a conservative tracer. The results showed that (1) the K- s in vertical direction (K- sv) was significantly higher than that in horizontal direction (K-sh), indicating that K- s of degraded fen peat behaves anisotropically; (2) pronounced preferential flow occurred in vertical direction with a higher immobile water fraction and a higher pore water velocity; (3) the 5% arrival time (a proxy for the strength of preferential flow) was affected by soil anisotropy as well as study site. A strong correlation was found between 5% arrival time and dispersivity, K- s and mobile water fraction; (4) phosphate release was observed from drained peat only. The impact of soil heterogeneity on phosphate leaching was more pronounced than soil anisotropy. The soil core with the strongest preferential flow released the highest amount of phosphate. We conclude that soil anisotropy is crucial in peatland hydrology but additional research is required to fully understand anisotropy effects on solute transport.

AB Bacteria in peat forest soil play important role in global carbon cycling. The distribution of bacteria population in different peat soils as a whole and how forest management practices alter the bacterial populations are still poorly known. Using pyrosequencing analysis of 16S rRNA gene, we quantified the diversity and community structure of bacteria in eight peat forest soils (pristine and drained) and two mineral forest soils from Lakkasuo, Finland with either spruce-dominant or pine-dominant tree species. In total, 191,229 sequences which ranged from 15,710 to 22,730 per sample were obtained and affiliated to 13 phyla, 30 classes and 155 genera, The peat forest soils showed high bacterial diversity and species richness. The tree species seems to have more strong impact on the bacterial diversity than the type of peat soil, which drives the changes in bacterial community structure. The dominant taxonomic groups across all soils (>1% of all sequences) were Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia. The relative abundance of bacteria phylum and genus differed between soil types and between vegetation. Significant differences in relative abundance of bacteria phyla were only found for Gemmatimonadetes and Cyanobacteria between the pristine and the drained peat forest soils. At genus level, the relative abundance of several genera differed significantly between the peat soils with same or different tree species, including Burkholderia, Caulobacter, Opitutus, Mucilanginibacter, Acidocella, Mycobacterium, Bradyrhizobium, Dyella and Rhodanobacter.

AB Drained peatlands are considered to be insignificant CH4 sources, but the effect of drainage on CH4 dynamics has not been extensively studied. We investigated seasonal dynamics of CH4 in two fen peat soils and one bog peat soil under permanent grassland in Denmark.
   Soil CH4 concentrations were measured several times throughout the year in parallel to a one year CH4 flux monitoring campaign with static chambers. Additionally, CH4 production potentials were determined in a laboratory incubation assay for the bog soil.
   Methane fluxes were generally negligible, even though soil CH4 concentrations of up to 155 and 1000 mu mol CH4 dm(-3) were measured in one of the fen peats and in the bog peat, respectively. Significant CH4 concentrations were observed above the water table. Methane production assays confirmed the presence of viable methanogens in the upper parts of the bog peat soil. The aerenchymous plant Juncus effusus L. liberated CH4 from the peat at rates of up to 3.3 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). No CH4 dynamics were observed in the second fen peat which, in contrast to the other two sites, had high sulfate concentrations.
   Peat type and the distribution of aerenchymous plants should be considered before dismissing grasslands on peat as CH4 sources.

AB Large areas of peatlands in Germany and the Netherlands are affected by drainage and high nitrogen deposition. Sheep grazing is a common extensive management activity on drained peatlands, in particular on nature protection areas. However, input of easily mineralisable material such as sheep excrements could enhance degradation of soil organic carbon (C-org), thereby increasing the effect of these ecosystems on national GHG budgets. Thus, a microcosm experiment on the influence of sheep excreta on GHG emissions from a histic Gleysol with strongly degraded peat was set up. The N-15 and C-13 stable isotope tracer technique was used to partition sources of CO2 and N2O. Labeled sheep faeces and urine were obtained by feeding enriched material. Undisturbed soil columns were treated with surface application of urine, faeces or mixtures of both in different label combinations to distinguish between direct effects and possible priming effects. Incubation was done under stable temperature and precipitation conditions. Fluxes as well as N-15 and C-13 enrichment of N2O and CO2, respectively, were measured for three weeks. Addition of sheep excreta increased emission of total CO2 in proportion to the added carbon amounts. There was no CO2 priming in the peat. No effect on CH4 and N2O was observed under the aerobic experimental conditions. The N2O-N source shifted from peat to excreta, which indicates negative priming, but priming was not significant. The results indicate that sheep excreta do not significantly increase GHG emissions from degraded peat soils. Considering the degraded peatland preserving benefits, sheep grazing on peatlands affected by drainage and high nitrogen deposition should be further promoted. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB The effect of different densities of Lumbricus rubellus on the nematode community was studied in a field experiment. The stand, a cultivated meadow on peat-muck soil developed from moderately decomposed alder peat, was located on drained fens in the central basin of the Biebrza valley in the north-eastern part of Poland. Samples were taken from soil isolators into which 0, 2, 4 or 6 earthworms were previously introduced. The abundance and trophic structure of the nematode fauna in the different treatments were compared 30, 60, 90 and 120 d after the introduction of L. rubellus. The effect of L rubellus on soil nematodes was most pronounced at the beginning of the experiment. Thirty days after introduction of L. rubellus, the total number of nematodes in all trials with earthworms was significantly lower than in the control, and nematode numbers decreased with increasing L. rubellus density. On later sampling dates, the results were less clear and 120 d after introduction of L. rubellus no significant effect on the total number of nematodes was observed in the treatments. The abundance of the bacterial-, fungal- and plant-feeding nematodes in the treatments with earthworms was lower than in the control 30 d after introduction of L. rubellus, but significant differences were found only in the case of bacterial feeders.

AB This study comparing the net ecosystem CO2 exchange in natural, restored, and naturally regenerated peatlands assesses the significance of peatland restoration as a global biotic offset under the Kyoto Protocol. Maximum gross photosynthesis (GP) at the restored peatland (-17.5 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1)) was more than two times that at lawns in the natural peatland (-8.2 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1)) and almost three times that of the naturally regenerated peatland (-6.5 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1)). However, GP(max) at hummock sites (-18.1 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1)) in the natural peatland exceeded that of the restored peatland. Total rainfall during the study period was similar to 75% of the 30-year mean and these drier conditions resulted in all sites being a net source of atmospheric CO2 during the summer. From May 5 to August 23, 1998 respiration followed the trend: mined (398 g C m(-2)) > restored (169 g C m(-2)) > natural (138 g C m(-2)) peatland. While restoration did not return the net carbon sink function, it resulted in a significant decrease in the source of atmospheric CO2 (229 g C m(-2)) over the summer season. Approximately 70% of this decrease was due to the increase in gross ecosystem production, while the remaining 30% was due to a decrease in total respiration. The presence of Sphagnum mosses at the naturally regenerated peatland also resulted in a similar to 45% decrease in total respiration (soil and plants), indicating that an increase in volumetric soil moisture content during restoration has the potential to lower soil respiration at abandoned mined peatlands. Considering the area of drained and mined peatlands globally, peatland restoration on abandoned mined peatlands has the potential to represent an important biotic offset through enhanced carbon sequestration.

AB We investigated seasonal patterns of needle mass and foliar N, P and K of tamarack (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch.) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) as affected by fertilization of undrained and drained minerotrophic peatland sites. The drained site was ditched in fall 1987. Four N-P-K fertilization treatments, i.e. 0-0-0, 0-80-120, 200-80-120, and 400-80-120 kg ha(-1), replicated three times on each site were applied at the end of May 1989. Short-shoot needle of tamarack and current and one-year needles of black spruce were sampled bi-weekly from 12 June to 15 October, 1989. Drainage and fertilization modified the foliar phenology of tamarack, Budbreak and senescence of needles were delayed on the drained site. N-fertilization delayed senescence of tamarack needles for two weeks on the undrained site. Needle mass of short-shoots of tamarack and current needles of black spruce increased during needle expansion on both sites. During needle maturation, current needle mass of black spruce increased on both sites in all treatments with greater increase in N-fertilized plots. N-fertilization increased foliar N of both species on both sires with greater increase on the drained but decreased foliar P and K throughout the season, PK-fertilization increased P and K contents and concentrations of tamarack on the drained site and of current and one-year-old needles of black spruce. For tamarack, drainage without fertilization increased rates of efflux (negative value) of foliar N, P and K. N-fertilization increased influx of N and P during needle elongation and expansion, i.e. phases 1 and 2, respectively. During needle senescence, efflux of N and K on the drained site were greater in N-fertilized plots than in N0PK plots. For black spruce, drained without fertilization resulted in an influx of P and K and efflux of N. Additionally, N-fertilization increased influx of P in the undrained site during needle expansion.

ID REGIONAL GROUNDWATER-FLOW; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS;
   ENGLAND; SYSTEMS; WALES; LAKES
AB Inflow of nutrient poor alkaline groundwater is generally seen as a prerequisite for the development of species rich fen vegetation. Drainage and groundwater abstraction may lead to the development of so-called rainwater lenses in the upper groundwater of fens, which prevent upward seeping alkaline groundwater from reaching the fen root zone. This threatens the conservation of the species rich vegetation. To provide insight in rainwater lens dynamics as a basis for conservation and restoration of fen biodiversity, numerical groundwater flow model simulations were performed for a hypothetical case area in the Netherlands.
   The simulations indicate that drainage canal surface water levels mainly affect the phreatic level in the fens, while groundwater inflow fluxes mainly affect the thickness of the rainwater lens. Increasing thickness of a semi-confining surface layer results in a rise in phreatic level. As the phreatic level reaches the soil surface, the rainwater lens may split in two as a result of groundwater discharge windows, which come into existence in the centre of the parcel. The effect of seasonal recharge fluctuations on the rainwater lens appears small. Spells of dry and wet years have a considerably larger effect especially on the lower boundary of the rainwater lens, resulting in thinner lenses during spells of dry years.
   Most simulations show rainwater lens thicknesses well exceeding rooting depths of fen plants. This is inconsistent with the fact that fen vegetation is found in nature reserves for which the simulations are considered representative. Chemical buffer processes in the soil may explain this inconsistency, masking an acidification process under way. As buffer capacities become exhausted over time, acidification and fen deterioration will occur at a certain future moment. To arrive at more definite conclusions about this hypothesis, our simulations of convective groundwater flow need to be supplemented by modelling of hydrochemical processes in rainwater lenses, followed by verification at actual field locations.

AB 1. Human activities have been a significant driver of environmental changes with tremendous consequences for carbon (C) dynamics. Peatlands are critical ecosystems because they store similar to 30% of the global soil organic C pool and are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic changes. The Zoige peatland on the eastern Tibet Plateau, as the largest alpine peatland in the world, accounts for 1 parts per thousand of global peat soil organic C storage. However, this peatland has experienced dramatic climate change including increased temperature and reduced precipitation in the past decades, which likely is responsible for a decline of the water-table and facilitated earthworm invasion, two major factors reducing soil organic carbon (SOC) storage of peatlands.
   2. Because earthworms often are more active in low-than in high-moisture peatlands, we hypothesized that the simultaneous occurrence of water-table decline and earthworm invasion would synergistically accelerate the release of SOC from peatland soil. We conducted a field experiment with a paired split-plot design, i.e. presence vs. absence of the invasive earthworms (Pheretima aspergillum) nested in drained vs. undrained plots, respectively, for 3 years within the homogenous Zoige peatland.
   3. Water-table decline significantly decreased soil water content and bulk density, resulting in a marked reduction of SOC storage. Moreover, consistent with our hypothesis, earthworm presence dramatically reduced SOC in the drained but not in the undrained peatland through the formation of deep burrows and decreasing bulk density of the lower soil layer over 3 years. The variation in SOC likely was due to changes in above-ground plant biomass, root growth and earthworm behaviour induced by the experimental treatments.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We suggest that incentive measures should be taken to prevent further water-table decline and earthworm invasion for maintaining the soil carbon pool in Zoige peatland. Artificial filling of drainage canals should be implemented to increase the water-table level, facilitating the recovery of drained peatlands. Moreover, the dispersal of earthworms and their cocoons attached to the roots of crop plants and tree saplings from low-lying areas to the Zoige region should be prevented.

AB Drained thermokarst lake basins cover large areas of northern high latitude lowlands. However, the importance of peat accumulated in these drained basins to carbon (C) cycling is poorly understood. Results are presented here from a permafrost sediment core aimed at investigating site history, lake drainage, apparent carbon accumulation, and paleohydrology in a thermokarst basin on the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta in southwestern Alaska. The results show that a thermokarst lake existed for about 2300 years before it drained and a peatland established in the early 1600s. Average apparent C accumulation rate (CAR) was 12 gC/m(2)/yr over the 2300 years before lake drainage, but increased to 120 gC/m(2)/yr following peatland initiation. After transitioning to a Sphagnum-dominated peatland at similar to 1700 AD, CAR reduced gradually before more than doubling from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. This abrupt increase in CAR was possibly in response to a Pacific climate regime shift in the late 1970s, a transition characterized by a nearly 1.5 degrees C increase in regional average annual temperature. Even after considering the differential decay of recent peat, there was an increase in C accumulation after 1977. Reconstructed water-table depths from subfossil testate amoebae show little change throughout the past three centuries, but there was a pronounced shift in testate amoeba composition after the 1977 temperature change (e.g., absence of Phryganella acropodia type and increase in Hyalosphenia elegans). If the results from peatlands in other drained thermokarst lake basins are consistent with the results from this study, then the C accumulated in these vegetated drained basins under current warming might help offset some of the C released from thawing permafrost and thermokarst features in northern regions.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions from managed peatlands are annually reported to the UNFCCC For the estimation of greenhouse gas (GHG) balances on a country-wide basis, It is necessary to know how soil-atmosphere fluxes are associated with variables that are available for spatial upscaling We measured momentary soil-atmosphere CO2 (heterotrophic and total soil respiration), CH4 and N2O fluxes at 68 forestry-drained peatland sites in Finland over two growing seasons We estimated annual CO2 effluxes for the sites using site-specific temperature regressions and simulations in half-hourly time steps Annual CH4 and N2O fluxes were interpolated from the measurements We then tested how well climate and site variables derived from forest inventory results and weather statistics could be used to explain between-site variation in the annual fluxes The estimated annual CO2 effluxes ranged from 1165 to 4437 g m(-2) year(-1) (total soil respiration) and from 534 to 2455 g m(-2) year(-1) (heterotrophic soil respiration) Means of 95% confidence intervals were +/- 12% of total and +/- 22% of heterotrophic soil respiration Estimated annual CO2 efflux was strongly correlated with soil respiration at the reference temperature (10 degrees C) and with summer mean air temperature. Temperature sensitivity had little effect on the estimated annual fluxes Models with tree stand stem volume, site type and summer mean air temperature as independent variables explained 56% of total and 57% of heterotrophic annual CO2 effluxes. Adding summer mean water table depth to the models raised the explanatory power to 66% and 64% respectively Most of the sites were small CH4 sinks and N2O sources The interpolated annual CH4 flux (range -0 97 to 12 50 g m(-2) year(-1)) was best explained by summer mean water table depth (r(2) = 64%) and rather weakly by tree stand stern volume (r(2) = 22%) and mire vegetation cover (r(2) = 15%) N2O flux (range. -0 03 to 092 g m(-2) year(-1)) was best explained by peat CN ratio (r(2) = 35%). Site type explained 13% of annual N2O flux We suggest that water table depth should be measured in national land-use inventories for improving the estimation of country-level GHG fluxes for peatlands (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB Persistent scatterer (PS) interferometry and small baseline subset algorithms can be used to estimate time series of surface deformation with high precision. In areas with low coherence, and in the absence of sufficient PS, the estimation of reliable phase information can be cumbersome. Here, we report a successful approach for estimating deformation at pasture on drained peat soils using the integrated use of data from several satellite missions, a parametric deformation model with a generalized least squares method, and spatial averaging over statistically homogeneous pixels. The developed methodology is analyzed and applied on a test site in The Netherlands, where we report local subsidence rates and periodic signal over the peat and pasture areas.

AB 1. As a consequence of large-scale decreases in the ground water table in western parts of the lower Rhine area, Germany, several Alnus glutinosa fens have undergone distinct changes in species composition and show signs of intensive peat mineralization.
   2. The chemistry of peat and the distribution patterns of vegetation were studied in an affected fen of 6.6 ha. Ground water level, pH of the peat, exchangeable cations, total nitrogen, organic carbon contents and herb layer composition were assessed at each intersection of a rectangular 25 x 25 m grid. The evaluation of individual grid values was performed with a geographical information system (GIS). Isolines and overlays for selected data sets were used to assess extent and direction of change.
   3. The peat of the drained areas showed decreased nitrogen, organic carbon, calcium and magnesium contents and low pH values. In contrast, bulk density and exchangeable aluminium increased in the mineralized peat. Though more than 800 g m(-2) of nitrogen was still found in the upper 10 cm in the wet areas, nitrogen stores diminished to about half this amount in drained peat. The decline in pH values and in calcium and magnesium contents was mainly attributed to H+ production related to nitrogen mineralization.
   4. The evaluation of overlays for selected variables showed a strong relation between the decrease in ground water level and declining cover of Carex acutiformis as well as peat acidification. Increases in exchangeable aluminium were also closely related to peat acidification.
   5. The investigation showed that spatial evaluation of ecological data can be useful for assessment of man-induced ecosystem changes.

AB Drained peatlands often act as carbon dioxide (CO2) hotspots. Raising the groundwater table is expected to reduce their CO2 contribution to the atmosphere and revitalise their function as carbon (C) sink in the long term. Without strict water management rewetting often results in partial flooding and the formation of spatially heterogeneous, nutrient-rich shallow lakes. Uncertainties remain as to when the intended effect of rewetting is achieved, as this specific ecosystem type has hardly been investigated in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange. In most cases of rewetting, methane (CH4) emissions increase under anoxic conditions due to a higher water table and in terms of global warming potential (GWP) outperform the shift towards CO2 uptake, at least in the short term.
   Based on eddy covariance measurements we studied the ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of CH4 and CO2 at a shallow lake situated on a former fen grassland in northeastern Germany. The lake evolved shortly after flooding, 9 years previous to our investigation period. The ecosystem consists of two main surface types: open water (inhabited by submerged and floating vegetation) and emergent vegetation (particularly including the eulittoral zone of the lake, dominated by Typha latifolia). To determine the individual contribution of the two main surface types to the net CO2 and CH4 exchange of the whole lake ecosystem, we combined footprint analysis with CH4 modelling and net ecosystem exchange partitioning.
   The CH4 and CO2 dynamics were strikingly different between open water and emergent vegetation. Net CH4 emissions from the open water area were around 4-fold higher than from emergent vegetation stands, accounting for 53 and 13aEuro-gaEuro-CH(4)aEuro-m(-2)aEuro-a(-1) respectively. In addition, both surface types were net CO2 sources with 158 and 750aEuro-gaEuro-CO(2)aEuro-m(-2)aEuro-a(-1) respectively. Unusual meteorological conditions in terms of a warm and dry summer and a mild winter might have facilitated high respiration rates. In sum, even after 9 years of rewetting the lake ecosystem exhibited a considerable C loss and global warming impact, the latter mainly driven by high CH4 emissions. We assume the eutrophic conditions in combination with permanent high inundation as major reasons for the unfavourable GHG balance.

AB Both peat utilization and peatlands themselves contribute to increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This article examines how peatlands with naturally high GHG emission levels affect net GHG emissions during the life cycle of peat. GHG emissions were measured from three drained peatland sites with high GHG emission levels. The impact of peatland type on the GHG emissions was considered when peat was assumed to replace coal in an energy production facility. The emission reduction levels achieved with the use of peat fuel originating from high-emission level peatlands stood at 35% compared to coal use and 30% compared to the average peat emission value. The findings indicate that GHG emissions can be reduced overall when peat from high-emission peatlands is utilized instead of coal. Lower emissions are primarily achieved because the harvesting of peat from high-emission level peatlands reduces the GHG emission levels of those lands.

AB Drainage ditches have been dug in peatlands and paludified forests to enhance forest growth in an area of 4.7 Mha in Finland. Because of peat subsidence, bank erosion, sedimentation, and the ingrowth of vegetation ditches deteriorate with time. In this study the shallowing of ditch depth over time was investigated based on a country-wide peatland inventory data measured repeatedly up to four times. Mixed linear models were developed separately for original ditches and maintained ones (cleaned once or twice). After 20 years, the ditches were 20-30 cm shallower than right after the digging. The time since digging was the most important variable explaining the shallowing for both original and maintained ditches. Other variables explaining the ditch shallowing were the digging method (excavator, plough), ditch bed slope, location, and peat layer thickness. The average development of the maintained and original excavator ditches was very similar. The results can be used in assessing decision making concerning ditch cleaning.

AB The CoupModel was used to simulate a Norway spruce forest on fertile drained peat over 60 years, from planting in 1951 until 2011, describing abiotic, biotic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO2 and N2O). By calibrating the model against tree ring data a "vegetation fitted" model was obtained by which we were able to describe the fluxes and controlling factors over the 60 years. We discuss some conceptual issues relevant to improving the model in order to better understand peat soil simulations. However, the present model was able to describe the most important ecosystem dynamics such as the plant biomass development and GHG emissions. The GHG fluxes are composed of two important quantities, the spruce forest carbon (C) uptake, 413 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and the decomposition of peat soil, 399 g C m(-2) yr(-1) . N2O emissions contribute to the GHG emissions by up to 0.7 g N m(-2) yr(-1), corresponding to 76 g C m(-2) yr(-1) . The 60-year old spruce forest has an accumulated biomass of 16.0 kg C m(-2) (corresponding to 60 kg CO2 m(-2)). However, over this period, 26.4 kg C m(-2) (97 kg CO2 eq m(-2)) has been added to the atmosphere, as both CO2 and N2O originating from the peat soil and, indirectly, from forest thinning products, which we assume have a short lifetime. We conclude that after harvest at an age of 80 years, most of the stored biomass carbon is liable to be released, the system having captured C only temporarily and with a cost of disappeared peat, adding CO2 to the atmosphere.

AB Drained peatlands dominated by purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea) are widespread in the UK and Western Europe. Although substantial carbon stores may be present in these peatlands, in this degraded state they are not currently acting as carbon sinks. Therefore, M.caerulea dominated peatlands have been identified as potential sites for ecohydrological restoration to tackle the current climate emergency. However, at present little is known about whether ditch blocking can raise water tables and promote the recovery of bog plant species, and the subsequent effects on carbon sequestration in these peatlands.
   To investigate the potential for restoration, we measured changes in water table depth, vegetation composition, photosynthesis at 1000 mu mol Photons m(-2) s(-1) (P-G1000), ecosystem respiration (R-Eco) and partitioned below-ground respiration in two M.caerulea dominated peatlands in which drainage ditches had been blocked located in Exmoor National Park, southwest England. Measurements were made in two headwater catchments at 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 of the distance between adjacent drainage ditches at four control-restored paired sites, during the growing seasons pre- (2012) and post- (2014, 2016 & 2018) restoration.
   Restoration had a small but significant (p = 0.009) effect on water table depths however, this did not result in a significant change in vegetation composition (p > 0.350). Ecosystem respiration increased in both the control and restored locations following restoration however, this increase was significantly smaller (p = 0.010) at the restored locations, possibly due to a similarly reduced increase in photosynthesis, although this change was not significant (p = 0.116). Below-ground respiration showed no significant changes following restoration.
   This research illustrates how degraded these shallow peatlands are, and raises concerns that ditch blocking alone may not bring about the high and stable water tables required to perturb the existing Molinia caerulea-dominated ecosystem and substantially alter the carbon balance. Additional restoration measures may be required.

AB Soil carbon sequestration and avoidable emissions through peatland restoration are both strategies to tackle climate change. Here we compare their potential and environmental costs regarding nitrogen and land demand. In the event that no further areas are exploited, drained peatlands will cumulatively release 80.8 Gt carbon and 2.3 Gt nitrogen. This corresponds to a contemporary annual greenhouse gas emission of 1.91 (0.31-3.38) Gt CO2-eq. that could be saved with peatland restoration. Soil carbon sequestration on all agricultural land has comparable mitigation potential. However, additional nitrogen is needed to build up a similar carbon pool in organic matter of mineral soils, equivalent to 30-80% of the global fertilizer nitrogen application annually. Restoring peatlands is 3.4 times less nitrogen costly and involves a much smaller land area demand than mineral soil carbon sequestration, calling for a stronger consideration of peatland rehabilitation as a mitigation measure.

AB Calibration period and control area method were used to study the impact of forest tree harvesting on the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export from drained peatland forests using data from 17 harvested and five control catchments. The results indicated highly increased DOC exports; during the first 3 years following harvesting, the average extra export ranged from over 200 kg ha(-1) in nutrient-poor ombrotrophic to over 400 kg ha(-1) in fertile minerotrophic peatland forest sites. The results indicated that a high iron (Fe) content in peat, as well as a high nitrogen (N) content and a low carbon (C) N ratio, are the site characteristics that contribute to large harvest-induced DOC exports. The effect of Fe is probably caused by the reduction of Fe in previously aerobic peat layers that have undergone harvest-induced water level rise and thus enhanced the DOC export, and the effects of the peat N and CN ratio indicate that the impacts of harvesting on DOC are the greatest from the sites with a high overall microbial activity. The calibration period/control area analysis revealed a high uncertainty in our data, the 95 % confidence intervals for average DOC exports overlapping between the groups with differing site characteristics. Given the uncertainties involved in our data, we conclude that significant changes in water colour and other water characteristics associated with large DOC inputs may be expected, where harvested forests on peatlands cover large proportions of catchments of small lakes and rivers.

AB Over the past two decades, great efforts have been made to restore coastal wetlands through the removal of dikes, but challenges remain because the effects of flooding with saline water on water quality are unknown. We collected soil samples from two adjacent coastal fen peatlands, one drained and diked, the other open to the sea and rewetted, aiming at assessing the mobility and export of various compounds. Microcosm experiments with constant flow-through conditions were conducted to determine the effluent concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ammonium (NH4+), and phosphate (PO43-) during saline-fresh water cycles. Sodium chloride (NaCl) was used to adjust salinity (saline water, NaCl concentration of 0.12 mol L-1; fresh water, NaCl concentration of 0.008 mol L-1) and served as a tracer. A model analysis of the obtained chloride (Cl-) and sodium (Na+) breakthrough curves indicated that peat soils have a dual porosity structure. Sodium was retarded in peat soils with a retardation factor of 1.4 +/- 0.2 due to adsorption. The leaching tests revealed that water salinity has a large impact on DOC, NH4+, and PO43- release. The concentrations of DOC in the effluent decreased with increasing water salinity because the combination of high ionic strength (NaCl concentration of 0.12 mol L-1) and low pH (3.5 to 4.5) caused a solubility reduction. On the contrary, saline water enhanced NH4+ release through cation exchange processes. The PO43- concentrations, however, decreased in the effluent with increasing water salinity. Overall, the decommissioning of dikes at coastal wetlands and the flooding of once drained and agriculturally used sites increase the risk that especially nitrogen may be leached at higher rates to the sea.

AB Little attention has been given to the pattern of hydrological connectivity between peatlands and water bearing fracture zones in crystalline bedrock. The construction of the railway tunnel Romeriksporten provided an opportunity for studying impacts of bedrock tunnelling on peatland hydrology and the hydraulic connectivity between peat deposits and deeper layers in an area with fractured Precambrian gneisses, exposed bedrock, and surficial covers of thin till deposits and peatsoils. Above the tunnel the water level in peat wells fluctuated with maximum depths up to 3 m, and water that otherwise would have generated surface runoff infiltrated in the peat. Drawdowns of the groundwater table in peatlands were observed as far as 340 m away from the tunnel trace. The deep drainage base provided prolonged water table drawdowns in peatlands in dry periods, and differential settlements in drained peatsoils resulted in secondary changes in patterns of surface water storage and flow. The groundwater drawdowns were influenced by the balance between tunnel leakage and water supplies from catchments and the wetland position within the groundwater flow system. Deep and simultaneous lowering and fluctuations of hydraulic heads in wells in the peat, the subpeat sediments and the bedrock above the tunnel demonstrated hydraulic connectivity between the peat layers and the bedrock, and revealed vertical flow even through highly humified peat layers in the catotelm. This shows that in peatlands with a subsurface of a relatively thin till cover above fractured crystalline bedrock, favourable conditions for groundwater flow from peatsoils to rock are not always restricted to a few specific sites, and indicates that attention should be given to the influence of peat water-bedrock water connectivity on impacts of groundwater exploitation, droughts and climate changes in such areas.

AB Peatlands represent globally-important ecosystems and carbon stores. However, large areas of peat land have been drained for agriculture, or peat has been harvested for use as fuel or in horticulture. Increasingly, these landscapes are being restored through ditch blocking and rewetting primarily to improve biodiversity and promote peat accumulation. To date we have little knowledge of how these interventions influence the microbial communities in peatlands. We compared the responses of dominant microbial consumers (testate amoebae) to drainage ditch restoration relative to unblocked ditches in a UK upland blanket peatland (Migneint, North Wales). Two techniques were used for restoration: (i) dammed ditches with re-profiling; and (ii) dammed ditches with pools of open water behind each dam. Testate communities in the inter-ditch areas changed markedly over time and between treatments illustrating the potential of this group of organisms as indicators of blanket peatland restoration status. However, the responses of testate amoebae to peat rewetting associated with restoration were partially obscured by inter-annual variability in weather conditions through the course of the experiment. Although there was considerable variability in the response of testate amoebae communities to peatland drain blocking, there were clearly more pronounced changes in samples from the dammed and reprofiled treatments including an increase in diversity, and the appearance of unambiguous wet-indicator species in relatively high abundances (includingAmphitrema stenostoma, Archerella flavum, Arcella discoides type, Difflugia bacillifera and Difflugia bacillarium). This reflects a shift towards overall wetter conditions across the site and the creation of new habitats. However, water-table was not a significant control on testate amoebae in this case, suggesting a poor relationship between water table and surface moisture in this sloping blanket peatland. Our findings highlight the potential of testate amoebae as bioindicators of peatland restoration success; however, there is a need for caution as mechanisms driving change in the microbial communities may be more complex than-first assumed. Several factors need to be taken into account when implementing biomonitoring studies in peatlands including: (i) the natural variability of the peatland ecosystem under changing weather conditions; (ii) any disturbance connected with the restoration procedures; and (iii) the timescales over which the ecosystem responds to the management intervention. Our results also suggest an indicator species approach based on population dynamics may be more appropriate for biomonitoring peatland restoration than examining changes at the community level.

AB Oligotrophic bogs prevail among wetlands in the mainland of the North of Russia. The study of the moss cover response to the increase in anthropogenic load makes it possible to reveal a shift in the ecological balance of bog ecosystems. The goal of the research is to reveal changes in the pigment apparatus of the moss cover under drainage, road construction and mining operation as in the case of the Arkhangelsk region. Sphagnum fuscum (Schimp.) H. Klinggr. was used as the main object for studying the pigment composition of the photosynthetic apparatus. A change in the pigment composition during the drainage of bogs was found when comparing the pigments of S. fuscum moss on the undisturbed Ilas bog massif and the drained bog massif "Ovechye"; the content of carotenoids decreases and the content of chlorophyll a increases. The influence of the traffic load was studied in an open wetland of the Mezen district, where there is no tree-shrub layer. Succession of dominant species is observed in the moss-lichen layer of the bog in the immediate vicinity of the road (34 m); the projective cover of sphagnum mosses decreases to less than 10 %, and brie mosses emerge as dominants. The content of all analyzed pigments in moss samples increases with the distance from unpaved roads, especially the content of chlorophylls (>5 times at a distance of 100 m and more). As an example of the anthropogenic impact of a mining enter-prise, we used terricones of the Lomonosov Mining and Processing Plant, PJSC Severalmaz, from which aeolian transport of dust particles of rocks containing saponite occurs. Near the pollution source, the content of total moss pigments is noticeably lower than in the area protected by a forest belt. A decrease in the proportion of chlorophylls a and b with a slight increase in the content of carotenoids was found in the pigment complex. The changes are due to the transfer of saponite; a clay mineral that actively absorbs water. The increased moisture provides favorable conditions for the moss vegetation, which mitigates the negative effect of pollutants on the pigment apparatus of plants. Overall, pigments content change represents plants adaptation to the adverse impacts and anthropogenic pressing.

AB The quantitative relationship between stand growth rate and water table level in peatland forest sites has not been fully ascertained in the literature. In this study, we investigated this relationship by means of a bivariate regression model, Tree and stand attributes, including volume and past 5-year volume growth as well as median water table depth (WTM) during the 1984 growing season, were observed in 69 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sample stands with three subplots established in each stand. All stands were located in deep-peated, moderately rich to poor organic soil sites in Central Finland (61 degrees 45'-62 degrees 26'N, 22 degrees 40'-28 degrees 29'E) that had been ditched for forestry about 25 years earlier (1959-1961). Prediction models for the fixed mean functions for 5-year volume growth and WTM as well as estimates for variances and the correlation of random effects at plot and subplot levels were estimated simultaneously using bivariate regression methods. The correlation of model residuals at the plot level was highly significant. The model was applied to simulate stand volume development for a period of 20 years. Simulations illustrated the dynamic interaction of stand volume, volume growth, and soil water levels: deep initial WTM resulted in stand growth and volume-development increases and subsequently further deepened the WTM in the stand. The model can be applied to southern boreal drained Scots pine peatlands to estimate the WTM in different stand volume conditions and to assess the effect of stand management on WTM.

AB Estonia is rich in peatlands, which cover 22.3% of its territory. About 1/4 of them are under protection, similar to 2% have been assigned for peat production, and similar to 1% is abandoned. Several peatlands are drained, which poses a challenge to their sustainability. The use of Estonian peat resources is regulated following the principles of sustainable management. During the inventory of Estonian peatlands (1971-1987) the properties (i.e. botanical composition) and quantity of peat were specified. In this paper an overview of these studies is given and new research fields focussing on chemical components of Estonian peat, i.e. trace elements, balneological characteristics, as well as the usability of the abandoned peatlands, are discussed.

AB Understanding the effect of long-term drainage of peatland areas is helpful in future peatland management and regulations of water conditions. The aim of this work was to assess the current state of fen peatland soils in the Grojecka Valley (eastern part of the Wielkopolskie voivodeship, central Poland), affected by long-term agricultural use (pastures, meadows) since the 1960s and potentially by lignite open pit mining industry (KWB Konin) since 1980s. Field studies were carried out in 2015 in selected fen peatland areas. Soil material for laboratory analysis was collected from genetic horizons from four soil profiles. The surface horizons of studied organic and organo-mineral soils were built with well-developed moorsh material. They were classified as medium moorshiefied - MtII (profile 1, 3 and 4) and strongly moorshiefied - MtIII (profile 2). Obtained results of physical and physico-chemical analysis indicate that long-term peatland utilization connected with potential impact of the lignite mining, transformed mainly the upper horizons of studied organic and organo-mineral soils. However, despite obvious strong human impact on peatlands ecosystems, we cannot exclude the climate variables, what should be confirmed by long-term monitoring program. Furthermore, presented paper indicated that new subtype moorsh-muddy soils (in Polish: gleby murszowo-mulowe) within the type of gleyic soils should be implemented in the next version of Polish Soil Classification.

AB Detailed, accurate information on soil temperature is crucial for understanding processes leading to solute leaching and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from managed peat soils, but few studies have attempted to study these processes in detail. Drained peat soils have different characteristics from pristine peat. Cultivated peat soils, in particular, have high mineral matter content in the plough layer, due to mineralisation of peat and, sometimes, addition of mineral material. This study examined the effect of mineral matter content on thermal conductivity (lambda) in partially frozen and unfrozen peat samples. Effect of change in temperature from -3 degrees C to - 10 degrees C on thermal conductivity was also estimated. Three existing models for estimating the thermal conductivity of organic soils were assessed for their suitability for cultivated drained peat soils. The thermal conductivity of peat samples with three different levels of mineral matter content was determined, using the single probe method, in the saturated state and when subjected to at least two different matric potentials at five different temperatures ( + 10 degrees C, + 1 degrees C, - 3 degrees C, - 5 degrees C and -10 degrees C). The results showed that X values differed between peat soils depending on mineral matter content, ice content and moisture content. The samples with the highest mineral matter content and bulk density had higher thermal conductivity at positive temperatures and to a lesser extent, at freezing temperatures, when volumetric water content and volume of water-free pores was similar. Most soil samples, especially those with no added mineral soil, were not fully frozen at - 3 degrees C and - 5 degrees C, but this had minor effect on thermal conductivity compared with values measured at -10 degrees C. The Brovka-Rovdan model proved reasonably good at predicting frozen thermal conductivity in sand-enriched peat soils, while the de Vries model proved best at estimating thermal conductivity for unfrozen peat samples. We provide a first estimate of the thermal conductivity of (partially) frozen cultivated peat measured using undisturbed samples. These results can be used to parameterise numerical heat transport models for simulating soil processes and GHG emissions.

SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL

AB Geomorphic and palynologic analyses were used to investigate the evolution of lakes in the Poles'ye, Belarus. Lakes developed upon recession of the Valdai ice sheet during the latter stages of the Late Glacial, aided by thermo-karst and karst processes and by fluvial activity. Drainage and fen development followed, and most lake basins were occupied by fens or wet bogs at the beginning of the Holocene, with open water remaining in only the largest basins. Subsequent climatic oscillations during the Holocene resulted in fluctuating water levels and episodes of paludification. The gradual trend of climate and environmental change led to increased paludification and decreased lake density and numbers throughout the Holocene. (C) 1997 INQUA/Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Drained and cultivated fen soils are characterised by continuous alteration of soil structure, which considerably complicates the precise simulation of soil water dynamics. Recently estimated van Genuchten parameters considering the gradient of moorsh-forming process were tested by hydrological modelling using HYDRUS-1D. Simulation was conducted for altogether four fen soil profiles of two peatland test sites varying in profile structure, land-use history and climate. Two parameter sets were applied to characterise the hydraulic properties of the fen soil profiles. The first one consisted of so far available or locally measured parameters, the second one of the new parameters, respectively. The quality of model output was assessed by comparing simulated and observed soil water contents or pore water pressure heads in consideration of the applied parameter sets. Model performance varied considerably for the fen soil profile under grassland use, where the mean normalised root mean square error (RMSEN) was 16.0% for the original parameters and 52.9% for the optimised ones. Contrasting results appeared due to the complex stratigraphy at the corresponding plot. For the rewetted plot formerly used as grassland, both parameter sets achieved comparable simulation results for all observation depths (RMSEN = 17.4%, 18.4% and 23.6%). When the locally measured hydraulic parameters were applied to the unused fen soil profiles solely influenced by drainage RMSEN decreased in average from 38.5% to 27.4% and 30.5% to 25.7%, respectively. However, for specific observation depths model's performance improved by using the optimised parameters. The problem of wettability of moorshified fen soil horizons was identified for one soil profile. Additionally, the new parameters created a more robust reaction in simulation when the residual water content was adjusted.

AB Losses of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from drained peatlands are of concern, due to the effects this has on the delivery of ecosystem services, and especially on the long-term store of carbon and the provision of drinking water. Most studies have looked at the effect of drainage in deep peat; comparatively, little is known about the behaviour of shallow, climatically marginal peatlands. This study examines water quality (DOC, Abs(400), pH, E4/E6 and C/C) during rainfall events from such environments in the south west UK, in order to both quantify DOC losses, and understand their potential for restoration. Water samples were taken over a 19 month period from a range of drains within two different experimental catchments in Exmoor National Park; data were analysed on an event basis. DOC concentrations ranging between 4 and 21 mg L-1 are substantially lower than measurements in deep peat, but remain problematic for the water treatment process. Dryness plays a critical role in controlling DOC concentrations and water quality, as observed through spatial and seasonal differences. Long-term changes in depth to water table (30 days before the event) are likely to impact on DOC production, whereas discharge becomes the main control over DOC transport at the time scale of the rainfall/runoff event. The role of temperature during events is attributed to an increase in the diffusion of DOC, and therefore its transport Humification ratios (E4/E6) consistently below 5 indicate a predominance of complex humic acids, but increased decomposition during warmer summer months leads to a comparatively higher losses of fulvic acids. This work represents a significant contribution to the scientific understanding of the behaviour and functioning of shallow damaged peatlands in climatically marginal locations. The findings also provide a sound baseline knowledge to support research into the effects of landscape restoration in the future. Crown Copyright (c) 2014 Published by Elsevier S.V.

AB We studied pine weevil (Hylobius abietis (L.)) feeding damage to Norway spruce and Scots pine seedlings planted in regeneration areas located on peatlands or on mineral soil sites in Southern and Central Finland. The survey included two planting years and a total of 60 regeneration areas (40 areas on peatlands and 20 on mineral soil sites). Some sites classified as peatland were as transformed or transforming drained peatlands that also contained mineral soil on a prepared surface. The soil preparation method, type of surface material around a seedling, pine weevil, vole-induced or other damage and the health of each seedling were observed in systematically selected circular sample plots. There was slightly more pine weevil damage on peatland than on mineral soil sites. More seedlings were damaged on unprepared peat and humus than on a prepared surface. Seedlings surrounded by a prepared surface had a slightly greater risk of being gnawed by pine weevil when planted on prepared peat compared to planting on prepared mineral soil. Vole damage was observed only in one region during one year. Mounded areas had slightly less vole damage than patched areas. In order to reduce damage caused by pine weevils and voles, it is important to scarify the regeneration area properly before insecticide-treated seedlings are planted. Mounding and patching are recommended so that seedlings can be planted in mineral soil whenever possible, even in the case of peatlands.

ID NEAREST-NEIGHBOR IMPUTATION; LEAF-OFF; LEVEL
AB Nearly 30% of Finland's land area is covered by peatlands. In Northern parts of the country there is a significant amount of low-productive drained peatlands (LPDPs) where the average annual stem volume growth is less than 1 m(3) ha(-1). The re-use of LPDPs has been considered thoroughly since Finnish forest legislation was updated and the forest regeneration prerequisite was removed from LPDPs in January 2014. Currently, forestry is one of the re-use alternatives, thus detailed forest resource information is required for allocating activities. However, current forest inventory practices have not been evaluated for sparse growing stocks (e.g., LPDPs). The purpose of our study was to evaluate the suitability of airborne laser scanning (ALS) for mapping forest inventory attributes in LPDPs. We used ALS data with a density of 0.8 pulses per m(2), 558 field-measured reference plots (500 from productive forests and 58 from LPDPs) and k nearest neighbour (k-NN) estimation. Our main aim was to study the sensitivity of predictions to the number of LPDP reference plots used in the k-NN estimation. When the reference data consisted of 500 plots from productive forest stands, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) for the prediction accuracy of Lorey's height, basal area and stem volume were 1.4 m, 2.7 m(2) ha(-1) and 13.7 m(3) ha(-1) in LPDPs, respectively. When 30 additional reference plots were allocated to LPDPs, the respective RMSEs were 1.1 m, 1.7 m(2) ha(-1) and 10.0 m(3) ha(-1). Additional reference plot allocation did not affect the predictions in productive forest stands.

ID SCOTS PINE; GROWTH; SYLVESTRIS; FORESTRY
AB Total and soluble nutrients in peat were studied after ash fertilization on an oligotroph peatland in southeast Norway. Plots 15 m x 15 m in size were fertilized with 0, 4, 7, and 10 tons ha(1) of wood or peat ash in 1944. Chemical analyses after 18, 35 and 48 years showed a gradual reduction of phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca) from the 0 to 10 cm surface peat layer. Some of the leached Ca was recovered in the layers 10-20 and 20-40 cm, while hardly any of the lost P was recovered in this way. The amount of potassium (K) in the surface layer declined by 75% over the first 18 years, and remained stable thereafter. Nothing of the lost K was recovered in deeper layers. The pH reflected the Ca levels. Over the years, an increasing proportion of the applied P, K and Ca was retrieved in the trees. Needle analyses indicated that declining tree vigor on plots fertilized with 4 and 7 tons of ash ha(-1) was due to P limitations. After 48 years, the peat content of P and Ca was still significantly higher in fertilized than in control plots, thus demonstrating the long-lasting effect of ash fertilization.

AB Ditch cleaning in drained peatland forests increases sediment loads and degrades water quality in headwater streams and lakes. A better understanding of the processes controlling ditch erosion and sediment transport in such systems is a prerequisite for proper peatland management. In order to relate hydrological observations to key erosion processes in headwater peatlands drained for forestry, a two-year study was conducted in a nested sub-catchment system (treated with ditch cleaning) and at two reference sites. The treated catchment was instrumented for continuous discharge and turbidity monitoring, erosion pin measurements of changes in ditch bed and banks and time-integrated sampling of suspended sediment (SS) composition. The results showed that ditch cleaning clearly increased transient suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) and suspended sediment yields (SSYs), and resulted in temporary storage of loosely deposited organic sediment in the ditch network. After exhaustion of this sediment storage, subaerial processes and erosion from ditch banks became dominant in producing sediment for transport. Recorded SSCs were higher on the rising limbs of event hydrographs throughout the study period, indicating that SS transport was limited by availability of erosion-prone sediment. A strong positive correlation (R-2=0.84, p<0.001) between rainfall intensity (above a threshold of 1mmh(-1)) and average SSC obtained on the rising limb of hydrographs for the sub-catchment showed that soil detachment from ditch banks by raindrop impact can directly increase SSC in runoff. At the main catchment outlet, variation in SSC was best explained (R-2=0.67, p<0.05) by the linear combination of initial discharge (-), peak discharge (+) and the lag time from initial to peak discharge (-). Based on these factors, ditch cleaning slightly increased peak discharges and decreased transit times in the study catchment. The implications of the results for water pollution management in peatland forests are discussed. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Drained agricultural peat soils are potential hot spots of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, but the biogeochemical basis for distinctively large emissions is still unclear. Incubation experiments with acidic bog peat, using nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), synthetic iron monosulfide (FeS), and ground natural pyrite (FeS2), suggested that heterotrophic denitrification of nitrate and nitrite was a major potential source of N2O in the peat soil. Neither FeS nor FeS2 amendment affected N2O production and therefore high production potentials of N2O were not a result of interactions between N oxyanions and iron sulfides, such as chemolithoautotrophic pyrite oxidation.

AB In this paper an experimental approach of aggregation in natural suspensions is presented. The suspensions are organic-matter-rich waters sampled in a brook which drains peat areas. The aggregation was conducted on raw samples in three different experiments lasting from 2 to 8 days. The particle size distribution (PSD) in the 0.5-10 mum size range was followed with a laser sizer and appeared to be almost constant along the whole experiment duration. Nevertheless, the volume of particles larger than 10 mum increased steadily, showing that aggregation occured. This appeared to be the consequence of a steady state aggregation which allowed the removal of the whole particle set within a day. The use of an aggregation model adapted to calculations on PSD allowed estimation of the aggregation efficiency for such suspensions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peatland-based treatment wetlands that purify incoming water by means of natural physical, chemical and biological processes belonging to the peatland ecosystem are widely used at Finnish peat extraction sites. They can comprise either undrained or drained overland flow areas (OFAs or DOFAs), with the OFAs representing the best available technology (BAT) for peat extraction. We analyse here the long-term treatment performance of these OFAs and DOFAs and factors affecting this performance. Data on 14 OFAs and DOFAs in different parts of Finland were taken from the extensive long-term environmental pollution control databases. Nearly half of these wetlands had been monitored for at least 4 years and seven for 8-23 years. The results indicated that peatland-based treatment wetlands purify drainage water as efficiently as other natural treatment wetlands on soils in general, the common challenge being phosphorus retention. Iron was also efficiently retained. The average reductions were highest in OFAs with good hydraulic function, and these also showed long-term water protection performance. An important factor affecting purification efficiency was the hydraulic loading rate. Important system design elements in this regard were the size of the wetland in relation to its catchment area, its gradient, the length of the water flow route within the wetland, and the efficient flow area of the wetland. The results regarding the latter two design elements strongly indicate that not all the areas potentially suitable in DOFAs for water purification are yet being used efficiently.

AB Peat extraction leaves a land surface with a strong relief of deep cutover areas and higher ridges. Rewetting inundates the deep parts, while less deeply extracted zones remain at or above the water level. In temperate fens the flooded areas are colonized by helophytes such as Eriophorum angustifolium, Carex spp., Typha latifolia or Phragmites australis dependent on water depth. Reeds of Typha and Phragmites are reported as large sources of methane, but data on net CO2 uptake are contradictory for Typha and rare for Phragmites. Here, we analyze the effect of vegetation, water level and nutrient conditions on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for representative vegetation types along water level gradients at two rewetted cutover fens (mesotrophic and eutrophic) in Belarus. Greenhouse gas emissions were measured campaign-wise with manual chambers every 2 to 4 weeks for 2 years and interpolated by modelling.
   All sites had negligible nitrous oxide exchange rates. Most sites were carbon sinks and small GHG sources. Methane emissions generally increased with net ecosystem CO2 uptake. Mesotrophic small sedge reeds with water table around the land surface were small GHG sources in the range of 2.3 to 4.2 tCO(2) eq.ha(-1) yr(-1). Eutrophic tall sedge -Typha latifolia reeds on newly formed floating mats were substantial net GHG emitters in the range of 25.1 to 39.1 tCO(2) eq.ha(-1) yr. They represent transient vegetation stages. Phragmites reeds ranged between -1.7 to 4.2 tCO(2) eq.ha(-1) yr(-1) with an overall mean GHG emission of 1.3 tCO(2) eq.ha(-1) yr(-1). The annual CO2 balance was best explained by vegetation biomass, which includes the role of vegetation composition and species. Methane emissions were obviously driven by biological activity of vegetation and soil organisms.
   Shallow flooding of cutover temperate fens is a suitable measure to arrive at low GHG emissions. Phragmites australis establishment should be promoted in deeper flooded areas and will lead to moderate, but variable GHG emissions or even occasional sinks. The risk of large GHG emissions is higher for eutrophic than mesotrophic peatlands. Nevertheless, flooding of eutrophic temperate fens still represents a safe GHG mitigation option because even the hotspot of our study, the floating tall sedge - Typha latifolia reeds, did not exceed the typical range of GHG emissions from drained fen grasslands and the spatially dominant Phragmites australis reed emitted by far less GHG than drained fens.

AB Root production was measured with the ingrowth bag method on two pristine and three drained mire sites of different fertility in southern Finland during 1993-1995. The sites were selected among those where root production had also been measured with other methods. Root biomass on the drained sites started to increase clearly only during the second growing season, whereas on the pristine sites the ingrowth of roots began during the first, summer after the installation of the bags in spring. This suggested a slower ingrowth rate of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and dwarf shrub roots than of herbs and Cyperaceous species, which were more dominant on the pristine sites. The ingrowth bag method gave results comparable to the sequential coring method for the fine-root production (diameter < 2 mm) on the drained sites within 2-3 yrs after installation of the bags, whereas on the pristine site the estimate for total root production (diameter less than or equal to 10 mm) was significantly lower than that obtained with the C-14 turnover method.

AB Evaporation from a cutover raised bog in The Netherlands was modelled using a detailed, physically based evaporation model for heterogeneous vegetation and unsaturated soil water how ''SWAPS''. The model enables a quantification of the role of heterogeneity on evaporation. Micro-meteorological measurements above a vegetation of Molinia caerulea (purple moor grass) in the cutover raised bog ''Engbertsdijksvenen'' are used for calibration and validation of the model. In the present study, it is investigated how small scale heterogeneity affects the prediction of evaporation. Therefore, two hypothetical variants, which represent two possible types of small scale heterogeneity in peatlands, are evaluated: (1) peatland in which drainage has resulted in a vegetation cover of 50% purple moor grass and 50% birch, (2) peatland in which after rewetting the vegetation consists of 50% purple moor grass and 50% Sphagnum mosses. The results show that characteristics of the evaporation from purple moor grass in the two variants are dissimilar. The evaporation from purple moor grass, forming the lower components of a vegetation stand (variant I), can be accurately predicted via radiation based models. In case purple moor grass is the exposed part of the vegetation (variant 2), such models are not likely to predict the evaporation from purple moor grass correctly. An exposed, aerodynamically rough vegetation requires a model that accounts for the vapour pressure deficit as well. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions from drained agricultural peatlands contribute significantly to global warming. In a laboratory study using intact cores of peat soil from eight different sites in Sweden, factors controlling the emission of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) were examined. Soil properties, and the abundance of the total microbial community (16S rRNA gene abundance), and genes encoding for functions controlling N2O emissions (bacterial and archaeal amoA, nirS, nirK, nosZI, and nosZII) were analyzed and compared against measured greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions were measured at different drainage levels, i.e., higher soil water suction values, since drainage is an important factor controlling greenhouse gas emissions from peat soils. The results showed that N2O and CH4 emissions were generally low, except for N2O emissions at near water-saturated conditions, for which three soils displayed high values and large variations in fluxes. Relationships between N2O emissions and soil properties were mainly linked to soil pH, with higher emissions at lower pH. However, specific assemblages of nitrogen cycling guilds that included nosZII, typically present in non-denitrifying N2O reducers, were detected in soils with low N2O emissions. Overall, these results indicate that both pH and biotic controls determine net N2O fluxes.

AB Many degraded ecosystems are subject to restoration attempts, providing new opportunities to unravel the processes of ecological community assembly. Restoration of previously drained northern peatlands, primarily to promote peat and carbon accumulation, has created hundreds of thousands of new open water pools. We assessed the potential benefits of this wetland restoration for aquatic biodiversity, and how communities reassemble, by comparing pool ecosystems in regions of the UK Pennines on intact (never drained) versus restored (blocked drainage-ditches) peatland. We also evaluated the conceptual idea that comparing reference ecosystems in terms of their compositional similarity to null assemblages (and thus the relative importance of stochastic versus deterministic assembly) can guide evaluations of restoration success better than analyses of community composition or diversity. Community composition data highlighted some differences in the macro invertebrate composition of restored pools compared to undisturbed peatland pools, which could be used to suggest that alternative end-points to restoration were influenced by stochastic processes. However, widely used diversity metrics indicated no differences between undisturbed and restored pools. Novel evaluations of restoration using null models confirmed the similarity of deterministic assembly processes from the national species pool across all pools. Stochastic elements were important drivers of between-pool differences at the regional-scale but the scale of these effects was also similar across most of the pools studied. The amalgamation of assembly theory into ecosystem restoration monitoring allows us to conclude with more certainty that restoration has been successful from an ecological perspective in these systems. Evaluation of these UK findings compared to those from peatlands across Europe and North America further suggests that restoring peatland pools delivers significant benefits for aquatic fauna by providing extensive new habitat that is largely equivalent to natural pools. More generally, we suggest that assembly theory could provide new benchmarks for planning and evaluating ecological restoration success. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, the ecosys model was used to simulate the hydrology of the Met Bleue bog, Ontario, Canada, with seasonally varying water tables in the upper 1 m. The soilprofile was divided into three zones of peat (fibric, hemic, and sapric). In the model, large, readily drained macropore fractions in the fibric peat caused low water-holding capacity and high infiltration rates, in contrast to hemic and sapric peat, with small macropore fractions, high water-holding capacities, and low infiltration rates. Model results for peat water contents, theta, and water table depths, Z, were tested with continuous hourly measurements from 2000 to 2004 using time domain reflectometry, probes and piezometers. Within the zone of pronounced water table variation, the theta and Z modeled with the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for macropore flow and Richards' equation for peat matrix flow corresponded better to the measured theta and Z (regression slopes between 0.62 and 1.03, intercepts between -0.05 and 0.02 m(3) m(-3), and R(2) between 0.40 and 0.56), than did the modeled theta and Z with Richards' equation alone (regression slopes between 0.33 and 1.43, intercepts between 0.11 and 0.22 m(3) m(-3), and R(2) between 0.27 and 0.41). The Richards equation done, even when parameterized with extremely high or low bulk saturated hydraulic conductivities of fibric pear, modeled slower infiltration, greater water retention, and lower Z than measured. The implications of macropore flow might be of great importance for peatland hydrology, therefore this experimental and modeling work should be extended to other wetlands as well.

AB Based on the 'European Mires Book' of the International Mire Conservation Group (IMCG), this article provides a composite map of national datasets as the first comprehensive peatland map for the whole of Europe. We also present estimates of the extent of peatlands and mires in each European country individually and for the entire continent. A minimum peat thickness criterion has not been strictly applied, to allow for (often historically determined) country-specific definitions. Our 'peatland' concept includes all 'mires', which are peatlands where peat is being formed. The map was constructed by merging national datasets in GIS while maintaining the mapping scales of the original input data. This 'bottom-up' approach indicates that the overall area of peatland in Europe is 593,727 km(2). Mires were found to cover more than 320,000 km (2) (around 54 % of the total peatland area). If shallow-peat lands (<30 cm peat) in European Russia are also taken into account, the total peatland area in Europe is more than 1,000,000 km(2), which is almost 10 % of the total surface area. Composite inventories of national peatland information, as presented here for Europe, may serve to identify gaps and priority areas for field survey, and help to cross-check and calibrate remote sensing based mapping approaches.

AB (1) Molinia caerulea occurs in peatland vegetation communities. However, under certain environmental and management conditions it may overwhelm the typical peatland vegetation, compromising ecosystem services including carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration and storage. Improved understanding of the effects of M. caerulea on CO2 fluxes in peatland ecosystems will better inform landscape management.
   (2) Photosynthesis at a PPFD of 600 mu mol M-2 S-1 (P-G600), ecosystem respiration and partitioned (heterotrophic and autotrophic) below-ground respiration were calculated from closed-chamber measurements collected over the 2012-2014 growing seasons within two drained M. caerulea dominated peatland catchments in Exmoor National Park, southwest England.
   (3) All CO2 fluxes peaked in mid-summer, in association with increased soil temperature and vegetation growth. During wetter periods, below-ground autotrophic respiration and P-G600 significantly decreased (p = 0.028 and p = 0.002), conversely heterotrophic respiration increased insignificantly (p = 0.081). An empirically derived net ecosystem exchange model estimated the growing season of 2012 to have been a smaller CO2 sink in carbon equivalents (-126 +/- 243 g m(-2)) than subsequent growing seasons (-146 +/- 310 and -234 +/- 325 g m(-2)) due to lower photosynthetic rates during a cool, wet summer (2012).
   (4) Management aimed at preserving the carbon store and increasing carbon sequestration through raising water tables may reduce photosynthesis and increase heterotrophic respiration unless the dominance of M. caerulea is reduced and Sphagnum spp. cover increased.

AB Drained peatlands in temperate Europe are a globally important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This article outlines a methodology to assess emissions and emission reductions from peatland rewetting projects using vegetation as a proxy. Vegetation seems well qualified for indicating GHG fluxes from peat soils as it reflects long-term water level, affects GHG emissions via assimilate supply and aerenchyma and allows fine-scaled mapping. The methodology includes mapping of vegetation types characterised by the presence and absence of species groups indicative for specific water level classes. GHG flux values are assigned to the vegetation types following a standardized protocol and using published emission values from plots with similar vegetation and water level in regions with similar climate and flora. Carbon sequestration in trees is accounted for by estimating the annual sequestration in tree biomass from forest inventory data. The method follows the criteria of the Voluntary Carbon Standard and is illustrated using the example of two Belarusian peatlands.

AB Fertilization of drained peatland forests with easily soluble or slow-release apatite fertilizers can increase phosphorus (P) export to water courses, especially when the soil is low in aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) hydroxides and oxides. Application of Al and Fe together with P increases P adsorption to the soil and decreases the risk of leaching. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of recycled iron phosphate (rFePO(4)) as forest fertilizer raw material from environmental and forest production perspectives. Trial fertilizers with different mixtures of rFePO(4) and Russian Kola apatite (Kap) were applied on 15 mini-catchments (area 100 m(2)), where the discharge at the outlet was collected, sampled and analyzed throughout the about 4-year measurement period. The foliage P content and height growth of the trees on the mini-catchments were measured. The biomass growth of the extramatrical mycorrhizal mycelia (EMM) was studied with a separate in-growth mesh bag experiment conducted on the same site. The results indicated no increase in phosphorus export to surface waters after application of rFePO(4) and 25/75 and 50/50 mixtures of rFePO(4) and Kap. In contrast to earlier studies showing a relatively high P export with different types of apatite fertilizers, the Kap fertilizer showed only minor phosphorus export. The height growth measurements and needle analyses of the juvenile Scots pine stands indicated poor P availability from pure rFePO(4), but the P availability from the 50/50 and 25/75 mixtures of rFePO(4) and Kap was similar to pure Kap. The mixtures of Kap and rFePO(4) enhanced the EMM biomass by 2- to 3-fold, whereas Kap and rFePO(4) alone, and high P availability (superphosphate) had no significant effect compared to non-P controls. The increase in EMM biomass as induced by concurrent application of Kap and rFePO(4) was not clearly reflected in tree growth and P acquisition. However, longer follow-up studies than in this one may be needed in order to verify the effect of increased EMM biomass on mycorrhizal mycelia mediated nutrient uptake and tree growth.

AB Little is known about solute transport in peats, despite the obvious importance of solute transport on ecohydrological processes in both managed and natural peatlands. To address this lack of knowledge, we investigated solute transport processes in an agricultural fen peat using a conservative KBr tracer. The main aim of the study was to elucidate solute transport behaviour in general in this peat, with a more specific aim of investigating whether preferential or bypassing flow occurred. The tracer moved through the peat more rapidly than expected, and the pattern of movement showed clear evidence of plot-scale bypassing flow. The data also provide evidence that bypassing flow occurs in pores at smaller scales. The implications of this study for management of wetland pastures in the Somerset Moors in south-west England are discussed. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This study presents the results of an assessment of the pyrogenic factor's contribution to atmospheric pollution in territories of the Tomsk region, based on the analysis of heavy metal (Zn, Pb, Cu, and Cd) atmospheric deposition within the Bakchar Bog (the north-eastern part of the Great Vasyugan mire). Atmospheric depositions of Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cd were analysed using the passive dust deposition method, measuring particle content per m2 during 2018-2019. Data analysis showed an excess of Zn in atmospheric deposition that persisted for three years after a fire in a drained bog, during both summer and winter observation periods, with a maximum value of 3.63 mg/m(2) per month in 2018. The impact of the fire on Cd and Pb content persisted for two years after the fire. The Cu content of atmospheric depositions is not affected by the pyrogenic factor. The analysis of seasonal dynamics showed that the Zn, Cd, and Pb content of atmospheric depositions was influenced by wild fires that cause the transfer of pollutants at both local and regional scales.

AB A non-linear programming algorithm was combined with a stand simulator consisting of individual-tree, distance-dependent diameter growth, mortality and thinning models, and a distance-independent height growth model. The Hooke and Jeeves' direct search method was used for determining the optimum thinning schedule and rotation length. The optimum solutions for both deterministic and stochastic optimization, with stochastic growth predictions, were calculated. In the optimization, stand density was regarded as a function of the distance to ditch. On the rather infertile site, it was most profitable to keep the stand about twice as dense near ditches and the extraction road, which was placed midway between two adjacent ditches. Stochasticity did not affect the optimum regimes markedly nor did it increase the expected returns of the optimum regimes.

AB Drained peatlands are significant hotspots of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and may also be more vulnerable to fire with its associated gaseous emissions. Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from peatlands managed for extraction are reported on an annual basis. However, the Tier 1 (default) emission factors (EFs) provided in the IPCC 2013 Wetlands Supplement for this land use category may not be representative in all cases and countries are encouraged to move to higher-tier reporting levels with reduced uncertainty levels based on country- or regional-specific data. In this study, we quantified (1) CO2-C emissions from nine peat extraction sites in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, which were initially disaggregated by land use type (industrial versus domestic peat extraction), and (2) a range of GHGs that are released to the atmosphere with the burning of peat. Drainage-related methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions as well as CO2-C emissions associated with the off-site decomposition of horticultural peat were not included here. Our results show that net CO2-C emissions were strongly controlled by soil temperature at the industrial sites (bare peat) and by soil temperature and leaf area index at the vegetated domestic sites. Our derived EFs of 1.70 (+/-0.47) and 1.64 (+/-0.44) tCO(2)-C ha(-1) yr(-1) for the industrial and domestic sites respectively are considerably lower than the Tier 1 EF (2.8 +/- 1.7t CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1)) provided in the Wetlands Supplement. We propose that the difference between our derived values and the Wetlands Supplement value is due to differences in peat quality and, consequently, decomposition rates. Emissions from burning of the peat (gkg(-1) dry fuel burned) were estimated to be approximately 1346 CO2, 8.35 methane (CH4), 218 carbon monoxide (CO), 1.53 ethane (C2H6), 1.74 ethylene (C2H4), 0.60 methanol (CH3OH), 2.21 hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and 0.73 ammonia (NH3), and this emphasises the importance of understanding the full suite of trace gas emissions from biomass burning. Our results highlight the importance of generating reliable Tier 2 values for different regions and land use categories. Furthermore, given that the IPCC Tier 1 EF was only based on 20 sites (all from Canada and Fennoscandia), we suggest that data from another 9 sites significantly expand the global data set, as well as adding a new region.

AB Investigation into the effects of beaver darns on hyporheic fluxes in channelled peatlands is needed to better understand how biological processes drive stream-riparian area connections and thus nutrient export, and to improve our overall conceptual model of water storage and flow through peatlands. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of beaver dams on vertical and lateral hyporheic exchange. Hydrometric methods were used to determine subsurface flow pathways and estimate hyporheic water fluxes for a third-order stream draining a Canadian Rocky Mountain peatland in 2006 and 2007. Three sites were studied two contained small, in-channel beaver darns and the third was a control. Vertical hyporheic fluxes equaled or exceeded lateral hyporheic fluxes despite the fact that hydraulic conductivity of the stream bed tended to be lower than the banks, suggesting peat hydraulic properties were not the dominant factor in the development of hyporheic exchange in stream systems draining peatlands as has been reported for streams underlain by mineral substrates. Instead, vertical fluxes were partially influenced by the presence of a mineral lens similar to 0.65 in below the ground surface. As well, high riparian water tables in relation to stream stage were key to limiting lateral fluxes. Steep hydraulic gradients above the two darns created looping flow pathways beneath and around them. However, little water actually flowed along these pathways. Measures of larger fluxes of water to the riparian area above the dams than those returning to the stream below the darns suggests either that hyporheic flow paths are longer than those measured in other studies or that the beaver dams generated recharge to the groundwater flow system.

TI Hydrophysical Properties of the High-Ash Lowmoor Peat Soils

DT Article
DE organic soils; water retention curve; peat density; ash content of peat
AB The water retention curve (WRC), density, botanical composition, and ash contents were determined for high-ash lowmoor peat soils (Rheic Sapric Histosols) developing on the floodplain of the Yakhroma River (Moscow oblast) from the herb-hypnum and hypnum peat enriched in carbonates, agromineral peat soils (Rheic Drainic Sapric Histosols (Mineralic)), and peat soils developed from woody peat underlain by herb, sedge, and woody peat layers (Rheic Sapric Histosols (Lignic)). The WRC was determined by capillarimetric method in the range of water pressure from 0 to 80-90 kPa. For the studied peat soils, the WRC represents a close to linear dependence of the water content on the water pressure in semilogarithmic scale. In contrast to mineral soils, a characteristic point of the air-entry pressure is virtually absent on the WRC of peat soils. The WRC of peat largely depended on their density: denser peat samples were characterized by a higher water content at the same water pressure, which attests to the increased water retention capacity. An increase in the degree of decomposition of peat and its ash content also leads to the rise in the water retention capacity, but the effect of these factors is considerably smaller than the effect of peat density.

AB The photolysis of nitrous acid (HONO) is an important source of OH radical, the key oxidizing agent in the atmosphere. Recently it has been reported that nitrite (NO2-) in boil can also be a source of atmospheric HONO, in addition to the other pathways, e.g. the hydrolysis of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on wet surfaces. However, the production rates of MONO in various soils are unknown. We selected a range of dominant northern acidic soils and showed in microcosm experiments that soils which have the highest nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions (drained peatlands) also have the highest MONO production rates. It is known that in natural peatlands with high water table and in boreal coniferous forest soils, low nitrification activity (microbial production of nitrite and nitrate) limits their N2O production. Low availability of nitrite in these soils is the likely reason also for their low MONO production rates. Lowering of water table of peatlands as a result of drainage or climate change enhances their nitrification activity and N2O/NO production and as shown here also their HONO production. Also nitrogen deposition, or nitrogen fertilization and other land-use practices increasing availability of mineral nitrogen can be expected to enhance HONO emissions from soils.

AB One important need in the context of peatland restoration is to gain knowledge of soil organic matter quality and current soil-forming process in degraded peatlands. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of long-term drainage on soil transformation processes. In autumn 2012, soil survey and sampling was carried out on five shallow peatlands in the Central Sudeten Mountains (Poland) which had been drained for forestry use in the late 1800s or early 1900s. Four organic soils (Histosols) and one organo-mineral soil (Histic Gleysol) were studied. The surface soil horizons were mainly transformed due to long-term forestry drainage. Increased aeration of these layers had enhanced their content of labile forms of carbon and they were undergoing secondary transformation. Soil transformation was more advanced in fen peatlands than in transitional mire or raised bogs. Only the fens exhibited characteristic evidence of the moorsh-forming process. Further drying of these soils will negatively affect their rewetting potential and significantly reduce the effective application of restoration treatments. In order to reduce organic matter transformation and loss from the investigated peatland areas, their drainage ditches should be blocked. Additionally, some trees should be removed from their central areas to reduce evapotranspiration.

AB Anthropogenic effects on soil fungi have been poorly investigated in peaty soils, where they have a crucial role in the maintenance of soil fertility and in the regulation of nutrient cycles. In this study, we assessed the effects of land-use intensification on the composition of fungal communities in Mediterranean peaty soils drained for agricultural purposes. To this end, a continuous maize cropping system was compared with an extensive grassland and an agricultural soil left abandoned for 15 years. Molecular diversity and community composition of total soil fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were assessed, as well as soil chemical properties potentially responsible for fungal shifts. The relative roles of intensification and soil chemical properties were also quantified by applying variation partitioning analysis. Multivariate analyses show that: (i) land-use intensification shapes the composition of the community of total soil fungi and AMF in soil and roots; (ii) base saturation (Bas Sat) and exchangeable calcium (ExchCa) in soil are the significant soil chemical drivers of the composition of the total soil fungal community; (iii) Bas Sat is the only significant chemical parameter shaping the soil AMF community; and (iv) no soil chemical properties affect root AMF. Based on variation partitioning, which highlights a large overlap between land-use intensification and Bas Sat, we can assert that land-use intensification is well-correlated with Bas Sat in shaping the total soil fungal community composition, as well as the AMF. By contrast, intensification acts as a major driver with respect to ExchCa in shaping the composition of the total soil fungal communities.

AB This paper addresses underwater vegetation in soft water lakes which are influenced by the anthropogenic input of allochtonic dissolved organic matter (DOM) from drained bogs. The aim of this work is to test the hypothesis regarding the role of DOM in shaping the diversity of underwater vegetation. Large differences in underwater vegetation habitats, the limitation of their occurrence to increasingly shallower littoral (the depth of the lower limit of their occurrence decreased from 12 m up to I m) and the regression of underwater vegetation were observed in lake types ranging from oligohumic (median (Me) of DOC in water = 2.5 mg C dm(-3)) to polyhumic (Me of DOC = 35.6 mg C dm(-3)). The gradual simplification of internal plant patch structure occurred and the Shannon-Weaver diversity index decreased (Me 0.04 --> 0.00). Fewer species were observed in the lakes (Me 9 --> 2), and the underwater vegetation covered increasingly smaller areas. Species replacement did not occur and no invasive species appeared.

AB In recent decades, the extent of Sasa palmata-dominant communities has increased in Sarobetsu Mire in northern Hokkaido, Japan, replacing the original Sphagnum bog vegetation. However, this marked increase in distribution of Sasa in the mire has not been formally documented or investigated in detail. Using aerial photo-interpretation, the present study updated the distribution maps of Sasa communities, showing the changes that have occurred to these communities between 1977 and 2003. The results revealed that the extent of Sasa communities has increased by 15.8 % from 6.60 km(2) in 1977 to 7.64 km(2) in 2003. The most marked increase occurred on the ground associated with drainage channels, although the oldest channels were constructed more than half a century ago, suggesting that some responses to the drainage of peat bog ecosystems may take a considerable period of time before becoming particularly evident.

TI Development of Heterobasidion spp. fruit bodies on decayed Piecea abies
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT

AB Because intensive forestry favors the spread of Heterobasidion spp., increasing amounts of decayed Norway spruce (Picea abies) wood in forest stands should be taken into account in the management of commercial forests. Spruce wood colonized by Heterobasidion spp. ensures fruit body formation, which increases the risk of new infections by basidiospores and, subsequently, the spread of Heterobasidion root rot. To date, very little is known about the prevalence of Heterobasidion fruit bodies on decayed spruce wood in different environments. To assess Heterobasidion fruit body production on various soil types and on different parts of trees, more than 36,000 fruit bodies on 425 decayed logs, 321 decayed trees, and 262 stumps of Norway spruce located on mineral and peat soils were surveyed. The most abundant fruit body formation occurred on infected spruce logs left on peat soil. Significantly more fruit bodies (average total fruit body area cm(2) m(-3)) were found on logs on drained peat soil compared to drained mineral soil (4960 and 2674 cm(2,) respectively). On stems of windthrown, uprooted trees, approximately three times more actively sporulating fruit bodies were formed compared to roots. Further, approximately two times more Heterobasidion fruit bodies occurred on the roots of partly uplifted stumps than on stumps with roots remaining in the soil. H. parviporum was identified in 88% and H. annosum in 12% of analyzed spruce individuals. In cases where the tree was infected by H. annosum s.s., fruit bodies of this fungus were also commonly produced on spruce wood. Abundant development of fruit bodies was also observed in abandoned agricultural and pasture lands. Moreover, rich vegetation in fertile forest types favored fruit body development on both mineral and peat soils. On such sites, infected logs and windthrown trees, as well as partly uplifted spruce stumps, should be removed to limit the spread of Heterobasidion spp. by basidiospores.

AB In boreal areas where forestry extends to drained peatlands, erosion and sediment transport from ditch networks are among the most harmful effects of forestry. To explore and quantify the initial bank erosion processes at their source area, topography of a 3.8-metre-long section of a newly cleaned ditch bank was measured at different times with a pin meter. The risk of erosion in the ditch bank was increased by generating elevated water table conditions using artificial irrigation. Erosion and soil deposition were estimated by calculating the changes in the bank topography between the sequential measurements. The total erosion was 41 kg m(-1) within the studied stretch. The eroded material was deposited at the bottom of the ditch and exposed to transportation only later during greater discharge events. The pin meter was found to be a workable device for detecting the erosion-induced changes (1-15 cm) in the ditch dimensions.

AB A change in German energy policy has resulted in a strong increase in the number of biogas plants in Germany. As a consequence, huge amounts of nutrient-rich residues, the by-products of the fermentative process, are used as organic fertilizers. Drained peatlands are increasingly used to satisfy the huge demand for fermentative substrates (e. g., energy crops, grass silage) and the digestate is returned to the peatlands. However, drained organic soils are considered as hot spots for nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and organic fertilization is additionally known to increase N2O emissions from managed grasslands. Our study addressed the questions (a) to what extent biogas digestate and cattle slurry application increase N2O and methane (CH4) fluxes as well as the mineral nitrogen use efficiency (NUEmin) and grass yield, and (b) how different soil organic matter contents (SOMs) and nitrogen contents promote the production of N2O. In addition NH3 volatilization was determined at one application event to obtain first clues with respect to the effects of soil and fertilizer types. The study was conducted at two sites within a grassland parcel, which differed in their soil organic carbon (SOC) and N contents. At each site (named C-org-medium and C-org-high) three plots were established: one was fertilized five times with biogas digestate, one with cattle slurry, and the third served as control plot. On each plot, fluxes of N2O and CH4 were measured on three replicates over 2 years using the closed chamber method. For NH3 measurements we used the calibrated dynamic chamber method. On an annual basis, the application of biogas digestate significantly enhanced the N2O fluxes compared to the application of cattle slurry and additionally increased the plant N-uptake and NUEmin. Furthermore, N2O fluxes from the C-org-high treatments significantly exceeded N2O fluxes from the C-org-medium treatments. Annual cumulative emissions ranged from 0.91 +/- 0.49 to 3.14 +/- 0.91 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Significantly different CH4 fluxes between the investigated treatments or the different soil types were not observed. Cumulative annual CH4 exchange rates varied between -0.21 +/- 0.19 and -1.06 +/- 0.46 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Significantly higher NH3 losses, NUEmin and grass yields from treatments fertilized with biogas digestate compared to those fertilized with cattle slurry were observed. The total NH3 losses following the splash plate application were 18.17 kg N ha(-1) for the digestate treatments and 3.48 kg N ha(-1) for the slurry treatments (36 and 15% of applied NH4+-N). The observed linear increase of 16 days' cumulative N2O-N exchange or annual N2O emissions, with mean groundwater level and ammonium application rate, reveals the importance of site-adapted N fertilization and the avoidance of N surpluses in C-org-rich grasslands.

AB Vertical distribution of nematodes down to a depth of 50 cm nas studied in a peat meadow soil in north-eastern part of Poland. The abundance and generic composition of nematode fauna in five soil layers (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40 end 40-50 cm) were analysed. It was found that total numbers of nematodes and their generic diversity decreased with increasing soil depth. Out of all nematodes, 65% (in May) and 72% (in September) were found down to a depth of 20 cm. The proportion of nematodes in the deepest studied soil layer (40-50 cm) was the lon;est, about 9% in spring samples and only 1.3% in autumn samples. Nematode fauna of the studied site was represented by 43 genera from 27 families. The most common genera in both sampling occasions were Acrobeloides, Aglenchus, Cephalobus, Filenchus, Helicotylenchus, Rotylenchus and Rhabdolaimus. Considerable differences in vertical distribution of some genera were also found. An attempt was made to use some soil characteristics of the studied site in interpretation of the results.

AB Soil nutrient conditions were investigated in a series of five peatland afforestation trials (established 1971) along a noah-south gradient in Sweden. AII areas were drained low-sedge mires and planted with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris (L.)). Soil samples from the topsoil (0-20 cm) were collected 22 years after drainage with two ditch spacings (7.5 and 60 m) and PK-fertilization with three fertilization regimes. Total and available nutrient concentrations were determined. Results indicated that pH and total concentrations of N, P and Ca in the topsoil of extensively drained areas increased with decreasing temperature sum in similar site types. Concentrations of K and Mg were not correlated to temperature sum. Tree height and volume were positively correlated to concentrations of P, K and Ca, but not to N, and only for temperature sums greater than or equal to 950 d.d. (day degrees). Hence, it appeared that P and/or K directly or through their effects on N mineralization, limited tree growth in the south, whereas another growth factor was Limiting in the north. We examined the available/total concentration ratios for the soil nutrients, with the intention to reveal possible climate-dependent trends in those ratios. The available/total ratios of P and Ca were found to increase with increasing temperature sum. For Ca in southern areas the ratios were higher in intensively drained and PR-fertilized plots than in the extensively drained and unfertilized treatment, possibly indicating that peat mineralization had been more intensive. The Ca-ratios for the two northernmost areas, which showed little or no tree growth reaction, did not increase even in the intensively drained and fertilized treatments. We hypothesise that the treatment-induced changes in available/total Ca ratio along the climate gradient also reflect post-drainage intensity of N-mineralization. Hence, the absence of increased Ca-ratios at temperature sums below 950 d.d. may indirectly indicate that tree growth is limited by the microbial release of organically bound N.

AB Mosses are important ecosystem engineers in mires. Their existence may be threatened directly or indirectly by anthropogenic drying, which further leads to shading and changed competition conditions via increased arboreal plant cover. Yet, some species are able to acclimate to the changing habitat, while some give way to new colonizers. In the shaded conditions, acclimation or adaptation to low light levels is likely to be a winning strategy to survive. We studied the light responses of photosynthesis and photosynthetic pigment concentrations in mosses from an open mire and its shaded, i.e. drained and forested counterpart. Against our expectations, the Sphagnum species found only in the open habitat had lower photosynthetic capacity and maximum quantum yield than those found to grow in the shade. Chlorophyll fluorescence results suggested that photoinhibitory damage to photosystem II is responsible for the low photosynthetic performance of the Sphagna of the open habitat, which were inefficient to utilize any light level. In the shaded habitat, Sphagnum mosses showed adaptation to lower light conditions only by possessing a higher chlorophyll content. Pleurozium schreberi reached photosynthetic light saturation at half the irradiance level compared to Sphagna. The lack of efficient photoprotection or repair mechanism after photodamage may constrain the success of these species in the open habitat. Thus, the dominant Sphagna in the open pristine conditions seem to be stress tolerant, while the dominants of the shaded drained mire appear to be species capable of maximizing their growth and production to compete in the unstressful conditions in terms of light and desiccation.

AB 1. Agricultural peatlands and their associated drainage systems are often highly managed and exposed to anthropogenic pressures, such as eutrophication and stable water tables, maintained via drainage during periods of high rainfall and inlet of, alkaline-rich, waters during dry periods. These pressures promote peat degradation, resulting in the accumulation of fine-degraded peat particles that dramatically alter aquatic habitats by smothering surfaces and decreasing water quality. Consequential effects on benthic communities are expected but have not been investigated so far.
   2.We hypothesised that peat degradation can lead to the decline in submerged macrophytes, which are of critical importance to sustaining biodiversity of benthic invertebrate communities. To investigate this, we analysed decadal (1985-2007) changes in benthic species richness in 29 peat ditches in the Netherlands and, to determine patterns of macroinvertebrate habitat occupancy, carried out a complementary field experiment with submerged artificial macrophytes, natural sediments and emergent bank vegetation.
   3. Results from long-term monitoring indicate that chemical conditions in agricultural peat ditches have improved slightly over the last decades; however, there has been a simultaneous decline in benthic invertebrate species richness and densities corresponding to a decline in the numbers of submerged macrophytes. The apparent dependence of macroinvertebrates on macrophytes was reinforced by our field experiment which revealed that invertebrate density was highest in submerged artificial plants, while invertebrate species richness was highest in natural emergent vegetation. Conversely, degraded peat sediments supported extremely few invertebrates.
   4. Our results clearly illustrate the strong influence of submerged macrophyte loss on macroinvertebrate assemblages in peatland waters. Furthermore, this suggests that improvements in water quality alone will not benefit invertebrates in the absence of suitable vegetative habitats.

AB The interaction between fluvially transported, metal contaminated peat particulates and acidic waters draining peatland catchments has received limited attention. Potential in-stream processing of sediment-associated metals in acidic stream water was investigated in laboratory based mixing experiments, designed to represent conditions of fluvial sediment transport in a highly contaminated and severely eroding peatland catchment in the Peak District (UK). Over the initial 20 min of the first experiment, stream water Cr and Zn concentrations increased by at least an order-of-magnitude and remained elevated for the full duration (24 h) of the experiment. Stream water As, Mo, Pb, Ti and V concentrations increased between 43% (As) and 440% (V) over the first hour of the experiment. After 24 h most of the metals appeared to have reached equilibrium in the water column. Results of the second experiment revealed that when the concentration of metal contaminated peat particulates is increased, there is an associated increase in the stream water As, Cr, Mo, Pb, Ti, V and Zn concentrations. The experimental data suggest that As, Cr, Mo, Pb, Ti, V and Zn are liable to desorption from metal contaminated peat into acidic stream water. The solubilisation of contaminated peat particulates may also contribute to elevated stream water metal concentrations. The laboratory based approach used in this study may indicate that when there is erosion of metal contaminated peat into acidic fluvial systems there is a concomitant increase in dissolved metal levels, especially when suspended sediment concentrations are high. Further laboratory and field based experiments are required to evaluate the relative importance of physical and chemical processes in the interaction between contaminated peat particulates and stream water in peatland fluvial systems.

AB Animal slurries and effluents are commonly applied to soil as a source of organic N fertilizer. By increasing inorganic N, applying animal effluents may also increase soil nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions. Our objectives were to (I) determine if dairy farm effluent (DFE) irrigation increased short-term N(2)O emissions from a surface-drained peat soil and a freely drained mineral soil and (ii) see if this increase could be attributed to increased N availability, increased soil water content, or a combination of both factors. We measured short-term N(2)O emissions following DFE irrigation in spring and autumn, using closed chambers. Nitrous oxide emissions from DFE-irrigated soils (50 kg N ha-1, 20-mm hydraulic loading) were compared with soils receiving inorganic nitrogen and water (50 kg N ha (-1), 20 mm), inorganic N only (50 kg N ha-1), water only (20 mm), and no treatment. Nitrous oxide emissions Increased immediately following DFE irrigation to both soils, and were generally greater than emissions following the application of inorganic fertilizer with water. Increased N(2)O emissions following DFE irrigation coincided with increased soil water contents and mineral N and CO(2) emissions. We suggest that DFE application increased N(2)O emissions more than inorganic N fertilizer by enhancing denitrification either by increasing C availability and/ or decreasing soil aeration following increased respiration. These findings suggest that the proportion of N applied to the soil and emitted as N(2)O may at times be greater for organic N fertilizers than inorganic N fertilizers, particularly if the organic N fertilizer contains sufficient available C to enhance denitrification.

AB The effects of wood-ash fertilisation on tree stands, soil characteristics and ground vegetation were studied on a drained pine mire in Finland (64degrees51'N, 26degrees04'E, 62 m a.s.l.). The original site type was a treeless, mesotrophic Sphagnum papillosum fen. The site was drained in 1933 and the wood-a h fertilisation experiment was started in 1947. The treatments were: (i) unfertilised, (ii) wood-ash 8 t ha(-1), and (iii) wood-ash 16 t ha(-1).
   Drainage and ash application had radical and long-lasting consequences on the biological activity on the site and the vegetation compartments studied. The understorey vegetation had been profoundly, affected by the ash with almost complete transformation of the species and other life forms. Even 50 years after the ash treatment the changes in vegetation/site type and the tree stand were clearly visible. On the unfertilised plot, the biomass of ground vegetation consisted mostly of mosses and dwarf shrubs, but on the ash-treated plots it consisted mostly of herbs and grasses typical of upland forests.
   Ash treatment had promoted stem volume growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) substantially and for a long time. The total wood production on the ash plots during 1947-1994 was 13 and 17 times over that of the control plot. Unfertilised pine trees suffered from P and K deficiency throughout the study period. The concentrations of some plant nutrients (P, K) decreased during the past years on Ash8. No nutrient shortage afflicting the tree stand was observed on Ash16 during the study period.
   Ash application has also led to increased concentration of nutrients in the peat. A sizeable proportion of the mineral nutrients applied were still in the 0-20 cm peat layer. On the ash-treated plots the amount of soil nitrogen (0-20 cm) was 18 and 29 times and the amount of soil phosphorus 9 and 13 times over the amount bound by the tree stand and the ground vegetation (Ash8 and Ash16, respectively). The stock of potassium was generally small in the surface peat-only 60-90% of the amount of potassium bound in the tree stand and the ground vegetation.
   It was concluded that wood-ash had powerfully influenced the biological processes in surface peat. The decomposition of cellulose was significantly accelerated by both ash treatments. Ash fertilisation also increased the emissions Of CO2. The intensified decomposition rate in the litter, vegetation and peat explained to a large extent the accelerated growth of the Scotspine stands studied. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Many environmental studies of restored peatlands focus on biogeochemical cycles, productivity and decomposition. However, changes in the composition and structure of invertebrate assemblages in restored bogs have received little attention. In the present study we describe effects of rewetting on the water mite faunas (Acari: Hydrachnidia) of four raised bogs located in northwestern Germany. All examined peatlands had been drained in the past, and two of them had been subjected to, peat extraction. The examined sites had been rewetted 2, 12, 14 and 25 years prior to our surveys, and currently represent different stages of plant succession. With increasing age after rewetting, the vegetation developed more complex structure as defined by Sphagnum status, and water mite fauna became somewhat similar to the fauna in an undisturbed raised reference bog. Water mites were found almost exclusively in bogs 25 years after wetting, and in these bogs they occurred in sites with more complex vegetation structure. Because water mites have high demands on abiotic and biotic factors due to their complex life cycle (i.e., the larvae are parasites, and the nymphs and adults are predators), we can infer that their mere presence irrespective of species abundance and richness reflects positive effects of the rewetting measures conducted in peat bogs.

AB Lowering of water table owing to climate warming and drainage has threatened the large reservoir of the preserved carbon (C) in peatlands. However, the consequent effects on northern nutrient-deficient peatlands are still under-investigated. Here, we compared a short- (42 days) with a long-term (30 years) drainage experiment, and quantified the activities of the decomposition-related extracellular enzymes as well as C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stoichiometries in a minerotrophic peatland in northeastern China. The results showed that the key hydrolytic enzymatic activities increased by 2-145% and 25-465% under short- and long-term drainage respectively, but the preserved nutrients and C in the peat did not vary considerably. The minerotrophic peatland seems to be a complex adaptive system with great resilience to tackle the short- and long-term drainage with two disparate mechanisms. Specifically, the intrinsic nature of severe nutrient-deficiency may weaken enzymatic constraints on decomposition (the 'enzymatic latch' mechanism) during the short-term drainage. In contrast, the increases in phenolics input and litter quality due to the shift in vegetation composition may alleviate the threat to C stores during the long-term drainage. These distinct regulatory mechanisms over the course of progressive lowering of water table may potentially provide new insights to assess the risk and benefit of drainage in peatlands.

AB The paper presents the degree of subsidence in stratigraphic transects and a change in soil morphology. The degree of subsidence was determined based on direct geodetic measurements taken in 1974 and 2012 and additionally with the use of empirical relationships of subsidence with the depth of drainage and peat properties. The histic horizon is built of peat thickness of 3 m on the Sosnowica and 0.64 m on the Uhnin. The value of subsidence of Histosol, measured by geodetic means, ranged from 9 to 33 cm, while that of Gleysol from 0 to 4 cm. The mean value of subsidence of the peatland in Sosnowica amounted to 24 cm over 38 years, which gives a degree of subsidence of 0.6 cm year(-1), i.e. a loss of peat mass amounting to 11.5% of the total resources. The situation is still worse in the case of the peatland in Uhnin, where mineralization and a fire of the peatland caused the peatland area to shrink by 36%. The loss of peat mass, including loss due to fire, accounted for 53% of the total resources, which corresponds to a degree of subsidence of 0.35 cm year(-1). In engineering practice, the degree of subsidence can only be determined according to Jurczuk's formula taking into account environmental factors and the passage of time.

AB To secure a steady operation of large wood processing enterprises in north-west of the Taiga zone, accelerated coniferous forest cultivation appears to be the most promising. Treatments with mineral fertilizers and herbicides create optimal conditions for stand growth and thus result in wood increment. Trunk wood qualities and, hence, the output of the most valuable trunk sections are contingent on the volume and anatomical structure of radial increment. This paper shows the effect of fertilization and herbicide treatments on the anatomical structure of wood in pine plantations of different stocking rates in drained peat soils. Variations of late wood share and density are directly associated with the changes in anatomical structure of wood. Fertilization of pine plantations with density of 4000 and 2000 trees/ha increased the number of early tracheid rows in the process of their growth. The application of fertilizers and herbicides in pine plantations stocked at 1000 trees/ha induced a gradual reduction in the number of early tracheid rows. A combined mineral fertilizer plus herbicide treatment enlarged the number of late tracheid rows in wood of the plantations stocked at various rates. The total number of tracheid rows per annual ring increased in the plantations stocked at a rate of 4000 and 2000 trees/ha. The reduction in total number of tracheid rows of plantations with 1000 trees/ha stocking rate is down to mineral fertilization combined with herbicide treatments. Fertilizer and herbicide treatment of the plantations with the initial density of 4000 trees/ha leads to the formation of thick-walled early and late tracheids. Application of fertilizers in pine plantations with 1000 and 2000 trees/ha stocking rates promote the formation of early and late tracheids of a larger diameter. Tracheids of a smaller diameter were formed in the plantations stocked at 4000 trees/ha. The overall impact of fertilizers and herbicides caused an increase of late tracheid size in the plantations with different stocking rates. Comparing the obtained data with the regulatory requirements of GOST 968-68 and the Laboratory of Raw Materials of the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Pulp and Paper Industry, we have found that cultivation of pine plantations with various stocking rates on dried peat soils using fertilizers and herbicides can be aimed at producing pulpwood (1st and 2nd categories) and high-quality sawlogs.

AB We estimated the soil CO2 balance of 68 forestry-drained boreal peatland sites in Finland by subtracting the litter input to soil from the CO2 efflux from soil. We also measured soil-atmosphere fluxes of CH4 and N2O and the CO2 sink of the growing tree stand in order to assess the current greenhouse gas impact of the study sites.
   The soil was, on average, a CO2 source of +190 +/- 70 g m(-2) year(-1) at the fertile Herb-rich and Vaccinium myrtillus type sites, but a CO2 sink of -70 +/- 30 g m(-2) year(-1) at the poor Vaccinium vitis-idaea and Dwarf shrub type sites. The source increased at the fertile and the sink decreased at the poor sites as the water table deepened. The source at the fertile sites also increased by increasing temperature sum, the highest CO2 sources being around +1000 g m(-2) year(-1) at well drained sites in Southern Finland.
   Both fertile and poor sites had a climate cooling impact. The sink in CO2 equivalents at the fertile sites was -690 +/- 90 g m(-2) year(-1) and at the poor sites -540 +/- 70 g m(-2) year(-1). The greater sink at the fertile sites was due to clearly better tree growth, their tree stand CO2 sink being -880 +/- 60 g m(-2) year(-1) compared to the -490 +/- 60 g m(-2) year(-1) at the poor sites.
   Ditching-based forestry can be climatically sustainable at nutrient-poor boreal peatlands since the peat soil continues to be a CO2 sink even after drainage. At the fertile sites, forestry will inevitably lead to loss of carbon in the long term, unless the tree biomass is stored after cuttings, for example in wooden buildings or as biochar in agricultural soils.

AB Betula humilis is a shrubby species growing on fen peatlands, with a biogeographical range extending from Germany to Central Siberia. The aim of this study is to revise the variability of vegetation with B. humilis in Central Europe and to assess its ecological status. The results explain divergent observations of various authors and present the variability of vegetation with B. humilis in a wide geographical and ecological context. Authors describing locally the association Betulo-Salicetum repentis/Betuletum humilis, frequently described various vegetation types, of which the dominance of B. humilis was the only common trait. Because drainage benefits B. humilis in some way, it has been observed from very diverse habitats including the full range of natural habitats of the species, as well as their, moderately to intensively, drained variants. If a separate association for shrublands with B. humilis is to be distinguished, it should involve only phytocoenoses where B. humilis is accompanied by a combination of typical non-forest fen species from the class Scheuchzerio-Caricetea nigrae. Brushwoods of B. humilis within degraded or drained peatlands that lack species of the Scheuchzerio-Caricetea nigrae class do not represent the association of B. humilis and should rather be regarded as its impoverished or degraded forms.

AB Soil subsidence of peatlands occurs worldwide due to drainage. The Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA), located in South Florida, has been drained for agriculture since 1914, with subsidence resulting in shallow soils in certain areas. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of water management strategies on soil oxidation and N release as affected by differences in proximity to the bedrock. Oxidation rates (CO2 efflux), as well as CH4 and N2O emissions, were measured in lysimeters filled with shallow and deep peat subjected to four water treatments. Additionally, NO3-N, NH4-N, soluble organic N, and dissolved organic C were measured in leachate obtained from the collected soils. Average annual emissions from constantly drained soils were 298 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1), with most of the oxidation taking place between June and October. Short flood cycles increased annual oxidation rates compared with constantly drained soils, which had the second highest oxidation rate. Constantly flooded soils had the lowest annual oxidation rates, followed by summer flooded soils. Total N lost in leachate was highest for constantly drained soils, with NO3 being the dominant form. The deep soils had higher losses of soluble N and C, whereas NO3 losses from shallow soils were higher. Soil oxidation rates did not differ depending on proximity to the bedrock. We conclude that strategies that avoid short flooding cycles and include crop rotations that allow flooding during summer can reduce oxidation and N losses in leachate from EAA peats.

LA English
DT Note
AB The effect of ground level on the bursting and development of primary basal buds, formation of secondary basal buds, and survival of sprouts was studied with 2-year-old pot plants of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) in an experiment in which the ground level was changed.  Both intact and decapitated seedlings were manipulated.  Raising the ground level reduced the bursting of dormant basal buds, while lowering it promoted both the bursting of buds and survival of the sprouts, especially in the decapitated plants.  Many new basal buds developed regardless of the ground level.  The intact plants also formed secondary basal buds, but these mostly remained dormant, like old, primary buds.  In addition, the concentration of new bud clusters in the uncovered part of the stem suggested that although the plant's internal condition is important for the development and bursting of its basal buds, environmental factors are also involved.  Ground-level changes on drained mires and at afforestation sites may significantly affect the success of sprouting.

AB N-15-Labelled urea fertilizer was used to examine initial uptake patterns of nitrogen (N) into foliage of tamarack (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch.) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP.), and movement of N from point of placement through live moss and organic soil on a drained minerotrophic peatland in central Alberta, Canada. The site was ditched in Fall 1987 and N-15-labelled urea fertilizer was applied on 1 June 1989. Tree foliage and soil samples were taken periodically during the 1989 growing season. A greater proportion of fertilizer N was retained (immobilized) in peat residue of surface soil layers (0-20 cm depth) and this did not change during the study period. However, mineral-N-15 concentration decreased from 76 to 19 mg N-15 kg(-1) between Week 2 and Week 13 following fertilizer application. Foliar %NDFF (the percentage of total N derived from fertilizer) and N-15 content (amount of N-15 per needle) increased rapidly for both species during the growing season. A higher proportion of fertilizer N taken up by trees was allocated to tissues of high metabolic activity, i.e. current needles. The foliar %NDFF was higher for black spruce compared with that of tamarack. This may be related to a greater size (amount of foliage and associated photosynthetic organelle) and strength (rate of biological activity) of the sink for N associated with black spruce relative to that of tamarack.

AB On a global scale, the release of greenhouse gases (GHG) from peatland drainage and cultivation are believed to account for similar to 5% of estimated anthropogenic GHG emissions. Drainage generally leads to peat subsidence and extensive soil loss, resulting in a diminishing store of soil carbon (C). This is a challenge for maintaining drainage -based agriculture, as such practices will eventually lead to the loss of organic soils that arable cultivation depends on. The conversion of croplands on peat to semi-natural grasslands, alongside raising water tables, is one possible way to reduce the loss of these valuable C stores. Here, we report the net ecosystem carbon balances (NECB) of two lowland peatlands in East Anglia, south-east UK. One site is a relic conservation-managed fen on deep peat, subject to active hydrological management to maintain water levels, and dominated by Cladium and Phragmites sedge and reed beds, whilst the other is a former cropland that has been converted to seasonally inundated grazed grassland. Despite occasionally experiencing severe water table drawdown, the conservation managed fen was a strong C sink of-104 g C m(-2) yr(-1). In contrast, the grassland was a C source of 133 g C m(-2) yr(-1), with gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions being the main loss pathway, due to low water tables exposing the soil profile in summer. At each site, ditch emissions of CO2 were moderately large (22 and 37 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), whilst ditch methane (CH4) emissions (0.2 and 1.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) made a negligible contribution to the NECB, but are important when considering the ecosystem GHG balance in terms of CO2 equivalents. Excluding dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), fluvial C losses were 6 g C M-2 yr(-1) for the conservation-managed fen and 12 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the former cropland, and were dominated by dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The small fluvial C loss is the result of both sites being hydrologically isolated from the surrounding agricultural landscapes. Although the partially re-wetted cropland was still acting as a net C source, our estimates suggest that seasonal rewetting has reduced net annual C losses to similar to 20% of their former cropland values. Maintaining high water tables year round would potentially further reduce C losses, and shallow inundation might allow the return of wetland species such as Phragmites and Typha, perhaps as floating rafts.

AB Natural mires and forested peatlands are known to be very significant sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to aquatic ecosystems. Peatland management operations (e.g., forestry operations, restoration of drained mires and peat mining) and extreme hydrological events may increase the DOC runoff. We hypothesized that an increase in phosphorus (P) leaching, together with near-neutral conditions in recipient lakes will accelerate decomposition of DOC that originates from acidic, nutrient-poor mire waters. The efficiency of DOC utilization was evaluated by measuring microbial respiration and bacterial production (BP) in short-term laboratory experiments with runoff waters from six boreal mire sites. Mere inorganic phosphorus (PO4-P) addition did not affect the rate of respiration or the proportion of decayed DOC. However, in the nutrient-poor bog waters, P addition slightly promoted BP and bacterial growth efficiency (BGE). In contrast, the elevation of pH alone, and the elevation of pH and PO4-P level together, caused a significant increase in respiration and in the proportion of decayed DOC, but did not affect net BP. Elevated pH alone, however, depressed BGE when compared to that under the combined elevation of pH and PO4-P. These results suggest that the increased P availability, e.g., after mire restoration, would slightly benefit bacterial net growth in P-limited waters. However, in near-neutral recipient lakes, the increased microbial decomposition of mire-originated DOC contributes more to carbon dioxide (CO2) supersaturation than potentially supporting detritus-based food chains.

AB Most rich-fen bryophyte species are currently declining and red listed in many European countries. Little is known about their past and current occurrence. We investigated past and recent bryophyte assemblages in mires in the land uplift coast of Finland. The study areas included primary succession areas where mire development started c. 6000 BP. In total, seven mires were studied in two successional transects along the land uplift coast. The past occurrences of rich-fen and other bryophytes were studied in 45 mire stratigraphic peat profiles, and recent occurrences were collected from 158 vegetation plots of 10mx10m. Bryophyte subfossils indicated that the central parts of the basins developed first to wet rich fens with groundwater influence, which developed towards intermediate fens or poorer mire types. Most mire bryophytes occurred in about the same proportion in peat profiles as in recent vegetation. Five rich-fen species (Hamatocaulis lapponicus, H. vernicosus, Meesia longiseta, M. triquetra and Pseudocalliergon trifarium) were clearly more common in peat profiles than in the present mire vegetation, where these species were very rare and appeared only in small patches without sporophytes. These rich-fen species have had markedly wider distributions in the past, probably linked to climate fluctuations, whereas current occurrences are becoming scarce because of multiple anthropogenic factors such mire drainage and climate change.

AB During the restoration of degraded bogs and other peatlands, both habitat and functional recovery can be closely linked with nutrient cycling, which is reflected in pore- and surface-water chemistry. Several peatland restoration studies have shown that the time required for recovery of target conditions is slow (>10 years); for heavily-impacted, drained and afforested peatlands of northern Scotland, recovery time is unknown. We monitored pore- and surface-water chemistry across a chronosequence of formerly drained, afforested bog restoration sites spanning 0-17 years, using a space-for-time substitution, and compared them with open blanket bog control sites. Our aims were to measure rate of recovery towards bog conditions and to identify the best suite of water chemistry variables to indicate recovery.
   Our results show progress in recovery towards bog conditions over a 0-17 year period post-restoration. Elements scavenged by trees (Mg, Na, S) completely recovered within that period. Many water chemistry variables were affected by the restoration process itself, but recovered within 11 years, except ammonium (NH4+), Zn and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) which remained elevated (when compared to control bogs) 17 years post restoration. Other variables did not completely recover (water table depth (WTD), pH), exhibiting what we term "legacy" effects of drainage and afforestation. Excess N and a lowered WTD are likely to slow the recovery of bog vegetation including key bog plants such as Sphagnum mosses.
   Over 17 years, we measured near-complete recovery in the chemistry of surface-water and deep pore-water but limited progress in shallow pore-water. Our results suggest that at least >17 years are required for complete recovery of water chemistry to bog conditions. However, we expect that newer restoration methods including conifer harvesting (stem plus brash) and the blocking of plough furrows (to increase the WTD) are likely to accelerate the restoration process (albeit at greater cost); this should be evaluated in future studies. We conclude that monitoring pore- and surface-water chemistry is useful in terms of indicating recovery towards bog conditions and we recommend monitoring WTD, pH, conductivity, Ca, NH4+, phosphate (PO43-), K, DOC, Al and Zn as key variables.

AB A field experimental study has been performed in a drained cropped peatland located in the Zennare Basin (south of the Venice Lagoon, Italy), to measure land subsidence due to peat oxidation and to address the primary relationships between the hydrological regime, the soil mass loss (in form of CO2 efflux to the atmosphere), and the settlement rate. The latter, of the order of 0.01-0.02 m/a, has been proved to be related to soil CO2 efflux due to organic matter oxidation. A series of CO2 emission measurement campaigns has been performed between the years 2003 and 2005. The non-steady-state chamber method was employed to assess the efflux spatial variability and detect its relationship with the main hydrological parameters controlling the oxidation reaction, i.e., soil temperature, soil moisture, and organic matter content. The measurements, carried out in two sites located 1.5 km apart, point out a great variability of the CO2 emissions both in space and time. While the time-dependent behavior can be explained by the seasonal fluctuation of soil temperature, spatial variability shows a weak correlation with the variation of environmental variables. Statistical data analyses show that CO2 efflux can be considered lognormally distributed and that the process is stationary within each site but not in the whole basin, though the properties of the outcropping peat layer and the soil surface seem apparently uniform. A geostatistical analysis reveals two different spatial correlation structures, with scales of spatial dependence of approximate to 30 m and approximate to 180 m. Finally, the collected data show that invasive agricultural practices such as deep plowing, tilling, and harrowing, largely used in the Zennare Basin, induce significant disturbances that are not easily recognizable during the flux surveys and that casually affect the temporal and spatial variability of the oxidation process.

AB This paper examines the implications of imposing a climate tax on food consumption in Sweden combined with refunding of the tax revenues to farmers for selected agricultural activities enhancing ecosystem services: restoration of drained peatland (carbon sequestration), maintenance of grassland (biodiversity), and construction of wetlands (nutrient regulation). A partial equilibrium model of the agricultural sector is used to assess economic and environmental effects. The results show that the introduction of a climate tax corresponding to the existing Swedish CO2 tax of 115 euros per tonne carbon dioxide equivalent reduces total emissions from food consumption by 4.4% without any refunding of tax revenues. Refunding with payments for all ecosystems enhances the carbon sink by an amount equivalent to 57% of CO2e emissions from food consumption, and results in net benefits in the tax refund system for the agricultural sector as a whole, but is regressive where farmers in regions with relatively high incomes receive proportionally much of the net benefits.

AB Inland water bodies are recognised as dynamic sites of carbon processing, and lakes and reservoirs draining peatland soils are particularly important, due to the potential for high carbon inputs combined with long water residence times. A carbon budget is presented here for a water supply reservoir (catchment area - 9 km(2)) draining an area of heavily eroded upland peat in the South Pennines, UK It encompasses a two year dataset and quantifies reservoir dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC) and aqueous carbon dioxide (CO2(aq)) inputs and outputs. The budget shows the reservoir to be a hotspot of fluvial carbon cycling, as with high levels of POC influx it acts as a net sink of fluvial carbon and has the potential for significant gaseous carbon export. The reservoir alternates between acting as a producer and consumer of DOC (a pattern linked to rainfall and temperature) which provides evidence for transformations between different carbon species. In particular, the budget data accompanied by C-14 (radiocarbon) analyses provide evidence that POC-DOC transformations are a key process, occurring at rates which could represent at least -10% of the fluvial carbon sink. To enable informed catchment management further research is needed to produce carbon cycle models more applicable to these environments, and on the implications of high POC levels for DOC composition.

AB Long-term observations on the effects of a fertilization treatment on Cs-137 concentrations in forest vegetation are scarce. Needles of Scots pine were used as biological indicators of radionuclide uptake of trees. The fertilization experiments are located in western Finland in an area where radioactive contamination from the Chernobyl accident in 1986 was relatively high (22-75 kBq m(-2)) compared to other parts of Finland. Fertilization treatments included different combinations of major nutrients, i.e. nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium. Needle Cs-137 concentrations of Scots pine were analyzed during 1991-2006. The effect of fertilization on Cs-137 concentration was tested 5 to 20 years after radioactive contamination from the Chernobyl accident in 1986. Fertilization clearly decreased Cs-137 concentration in Scots pine needles 1-21 growing seasons after application. Single K fertilization decreased significantly Cs-137 concentration 21 growing seasons after radioactive deposition on a drained mire. Mineral nutrients (application of commercial fertilizer or wood ash) can well be recommended for remediation of forests contaminated by accidental radionuclide deposition. The site conditions need to be taken into account in planning of remediation.

AB Estimation of the carbon (C) storages and fluxes in different forest ecosystems is essential for understanding their C sequestration ability. The net ecosystem production (NEP) and the net primary production (NPP) in five downy birch (Betula pubescens) stands, aged between 12 and 78 years, growing on fertile well-drained Histosols, were studied. Drainage of swamp forests is a large-scale manipulation, which causes significant shifts at the ecosystems level, altering C and nutrient cycling a great deal. Young and middle-aged downy birch stands (12-30-year-old) acted as C sink ecosystems, accumulating 1.4-3.0 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). In the 38-year-old stand NEP was roughly zero; annual C budget was almost in balance. The over-matured downy birch stand (78-year-old) acted as a C source emitting 0.95 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). Annual woody biomass increment of the stand was the main factor which affected the forest to act as a C accumulating system. Although the highest heterotrophic respiration (Rh) values were measured in the middle-aged stands, mean soil C emission did not differ significantly between the studied stands. Annual total soil respiration (Rs) and Rh ranged from 7.4 to 8.8 t C ha(-1) and 4.7 to 6.2 t C ha(-1), respectively. Soil temperature appeared to be the dominant driver of the soil CO2 effluxes. Temperature sensitivity (Q(10) value) of respiration rates (3.0-5.5), as well as the Rh/Rs (0.6-0.7) varied irrespective of stand age. Both the annual aboveground litter (1.5-1.9 t C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and fine root litter (0.9-1.5 t C ha(-1) yr(-1)) input fluxes were quite similar for the studied stands. However, the annual organic C input into the soil via above- and belowground litter was smaller than the annual Rh efflux, indicating that continuous mineralization of the peat layer reduces the soil organic C pool. The main share of the C stock in the drained swamp downy birch stands was soil C; the storage of C accumulated in the woody biomass of the trees accounted for only 5-20% of the total C storage of the ecosystem.

AB The potential for restoration of peatlands to deliver benefits beyond habitat restoration is poorly understood. There may be impacts on discharge water quality, peat erosion, flow rates and flood risk, and nutrient fluxes. This study aimed to assess the impact of drain blocking, as a form of peatland restoration, on an upland blanket bog, by measuring water chemistry and colour, and loss of both dissolved (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC). The restoration work was designed to permit the collection of a robust experimental dataset over a landscape scale, with data covering up to 3 years pre-restoration and up to 3 years post-restoration. An information theoretic approach to data analyses provided evidence of a recovery of water chemistry towards more 'natural' conditions, and showed strong declines in the production of water colour. Drain blocking led to increases in the E4:E6 ratio, and declines in specific absorbance, suggesting that DOC released from blocked drains consisted of lighter, less humic and less decomposed carbon. Whilst concentrations of DOC showed slight increases in drains and streams after blocking, instantaneous yields of both DOC and POC declined markedly in streams over the first year post-restoration. Attempts were made to estimate total annual fluvial organic carbon fluxes for the study site, and although errors around these estimates remain considerable, there is strong evidence of a large reduction in aquatic organic carbon flux from the peatland following drain-blocking. Potential mechanisms for the observed changes in water chemistry and organic carbon release are discussed, and we highlight the need for more detailed information, from more sites, to better understand the full impacts of peatland restoration on carbon storage and release.

AB Mire ditching changes dramatically mire biodiversity. Thus, drainage network detection is an important factor when analysing the natural state of a mire. In this article, we propose a method for automated drainage network detection from raster digital terrain model created from high-resolution laser scanning data. Sparse logistic regression classifier with a large generic feature set and automated feature selection is used for classification. Broken segments are connected with polynomial modelling. The results showed that our method can accurately detect artificial drainage networks.

AB Peatlands cover only about 3% the global land area, but store about twice as much carbon as global forest biomass. If intact peatlands are drained for agriculture or other human uses, peat oxidation can result in considerable CO(2)emissions and other greenhouse gases (GHG) for decades or even centuries. Despite their importance, emissions from degraded peatlands have so far not been included explicitly in mitigation pathways compatible with the Paris Agreement. Such pathways include land-demanding mitigation options like bioenergy or afforestation with substantial consequences for the land system. Therefore, besides GHG emissions owing to the historic conversion of intact peatlands, the increased demand for land in current mitigation pathways could result in drainage of presently intact peatlands, e.g. for bioenergy production. Here, we present the first quantitative model-based projections of future peatland dynamics and associated GHG emissions in the context of a 2 degrees C mitigation pathway. Our spatially explicit land-use modelling approach with global coverage simultaneously accounts for future food demand, based on population and income projections, and land-based mitigation measures. Without dedicated peatland policy and even in the case of peatland protection, our results indicate that the land system would remain a net source of CO(2)throughout the 21st century. This result is in contrast to the outcome of current mitigation pathways, in which the land system turns into a net carbon sink by 2100. However, our results indicate that it is possible to reconcile land use and GHG emissions in mitigation pathways through a peatland protectionandrestoration policy. According to our results, the land system would turn into a global net carbon sink by 2100, as projected by current mitigation pathways, if about 60% of present-day degraded peatlands would be rewetted in the coming decades, next to the protection of intact peatlands.

AB This paper presents a landscape-ecological analysis of Ladoga Region, a 30 000 km(2) territory around Lake Ladoga, which is the largest lake in Europe. The Region includes the contact zone between the crystalline bedrock of Baltic Shield and the sedimentary rocks of the East European plain, and the transition from Boreonemoral to Southern Boreal (Taiga) forest vegetation; it is characterized by abundance of lakes. The Region is divided into 17 discrete landscape areas that are classified in 6 groups.
   The author uses the landscape-dynamical approach to the analysis of recent (from 2-3 to 40-50 yr) environmental changes in the region, caused by human activities: forest felling, fires, peat excavation, agriculture, recreational development etc. The following processes are observed: vegetation successions after clearcutting and selective logging, effects of forest fires on the spreading and conservation of pine forests; consequences of peatland drainage; landscape effects of collective farming and gardening; forest succession from pine and deciduous tree dominance towards spruce dominance (observable in all landscape regions); natural vegetation succession on former Finnish arable lands (two types of scenarios: forest succession or development of sedge meadows).

AB In salt marshes, most biomass plus large reserves of biologically important N, P, Fe, and S are sequestered below ground under saline, waterlogged, and anaerobic conditions. Thus, hydrologic alterations such as diking and ditch drainage that reduce salinity and increase peat aeration can cause radical changes in the composition of salt marsh soils.
   Experimental short-term desalination and drainage of salt marsh cores in greenhouse microcosms caused Spartina production to increase after one growing season, reflecting decreased salt stress and sulfide toxicity. However, production thereafter declined, likely due to pyrite oxidation and acidification in drained treatments and sulfide accumulation in waterlogged treatments.
   A survey of longer-term (decadal) effects of diking on pear composition of Cape God, Massachusetts, USA, marshes revealed acidification, Fe(II) mobilization, and decreased organic content in drained sites. Despite the aerobic decomposition of organic matter, abundant nutrients remained as sorbed NH4 and mineral-bound PO4. In diked, seasonally waterlogged sites, porewater alkalinity, sulfide, ammonium and orthophosphate were much lower, and organic solids higher, than in adjacent natural marsh.
   Seawater was added to cores from diked marshes to study the effects of tidal restoration. Salination of the drained peat increased porewater pH, alkalinity ammonium, orthophosphate, Fe, and Al; copious ammonium N, and Fe(II) for sulfide precipitation favored Spartina growth. Salination of diked-waterlogged peat increased sulfate reduction and caused 6-8 cm of sediment subsidence. The resulting increase in porewater sulfides and waterlogging decreased vigor of transplanted Spartina alterniflora. Results indicate that seawater restoration should proceed cautiously to avoid nutrient loading of surface waters in drained sites or sulfide toxicity in diked-waterlogged marshes.

AB Climate change is predicted to cause an increase in frequency and severity of droughts in the boreal ecozone, which can result in the lowering of water tables and subsequent release of acidic, metal-contaminated waters from wetlands. We believe that in areas where historical deposition of metals and sulphur was severe, these episodic pulses of metals could reach concentrations sufficiently high to severely affect aquatic communities in receiving waters and cause a delay in biological recovery. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of drought on the chemistry of water draining from two Sudbury peatlands with widely contrasting peat organic matter content to determine the response of stream water chemistry to drought from peatland types in the region. Stream samples were collected using ISCO (TM) automated water collectors from June to November 2011. Following a period of drought, there was a decline in pH and a large increase in concentrations of sulphate and metal ions (Al, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn) in water draining both peatlands, with extreme concentrations occurring over a period of about two weeks. At the site with the higher peat organic matter content there was an increase in metals that have a high affinity to bind to DOC (Al, Cu, and Fe) during the onset of drought. This study demonstrates a dramatic response to drought at two sites that differ in metal and nutrient pool sizes, hydrology, and topography, suggesting the potential for a majority of peatlands in the region to experience this response. Efforts to restore aquatic ecosystems and protect freshwater resources must take into account these processes, as disruptions to biogeochemical cycles are likely to become more prevalent in a changing climate.

AB The dependence of the spectral reflectance (averaged over an area of approximately 0.023 ha) of peat and degraded peat soils of Polesye on the soil organic carbon content has been investigated under actual field conditions for the first time. The dependence is approximated by exponential and power functions, and the confidence intervals are explicitly calculated for each parameter of the approximating functions. The parameter values for the exponential function appear better validated than the parameter values for the power function, since the corresponding confidence intervals for the former are much narrower. The values of AIC and BIC information criteria show that the power model gives a better description of experimental data for bands 1 and 2, and the exponential model gives a better description for the 3N band of the ASTER spectroradiometer.

AB Palsas and peat plateaus are climatically sensitive landforms in permafrost peatlands. Climate envelope models have previously related palsa/peat plateau distributions in Europe to modern climate, but similar bioclimatic modelling has not been attempted for North America. Recent climate change has rendered many palsas/peat plateaus in this region, and their valuable carbon stores, vulnerable. We fitted a binary logistic regression model to predict palsa/peat plateau presence for North America by relating the distribution of 352 extant landforms to gridded modern climate data. Our model accurately classified 85.3% of grid cells that contain observed palsas/peat plateaus and 77.1% of grid cells without observed palsas/ peat plateaus. The model indicates that modern North American palsas/peat plateaus are supported by cold, dry climates with large seasonal temperature ranges and mild growing seasons. We used palaeoclimate simulations from a general circulation model to simulate Holocene distributions of palsas/peat plateaus at 500-year intervals. We constrained these outputs with timings of peat initiation, deglaciation, and postglacial drainage across the continent. Our palaeoclimate simulations indicate that this climate envelope remained stationary in western North America throughout the Holocene, but further east it migrated northwards during 11.5-6.0 Ka BP. However, palsa extents in eastern North America were restricted from following this moving climate envelope by late deglaciation, drainage and peat initiation. We validated our Holocene simulations against available palaeoecological records and whilst they agree that permafrost peatlands aggraded earliest in western North America, our simulations contest previous suggestions that late permafrost aggradation in central Canada was climatically-driven.

AB Peatland drainage results in several environmental impacts such as release of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere and leaching of nutrients to watercourses. These hazardous environmental effects can partly be controlled with soil management, and different drainage and remediation practices. Grading is a new method developed for soils with low conductivity suffering from poor drainage, water logging and ice. The soil surface is graded towards the ditch to increase surface runoff and drainage. The present study compares environmental effects of peatland grading compared to traditional intense pipe drainage. Detailed measurements of hydrology, climate, leaching and gas emissions were carried Out at adjacent drainage areas with grass cultivation. Additional measurements were made at plots that were abandoned, cultivated with perennial crops, and remained as pristine peatlands. The results show that the leaching of nutrients is highest from pipe drainage. Climate gas emission was considerably higher at all managed sites than from the reference pristine site. Drainage, soil hydrology and soil nutrient status seemed to control gas emissions. The gas emissions were higher than assumed for Norwegian cold conditions. The results confirm observations made on peat soils in other climatic regions. The highest emissions of CO2 were observed when the soil temperature was high and groundwater table low. The N2O emission showed a large variation with no clear pattern. However, at some locations it peaked after a dry period when NO3-N was leached. More CH4 was emitted from the intensively drained site than the graded site, but more CO2 was emitted from the graded site. The difference in leaching and emission properties is partly due to differences in near surface hydrology. At grade sites, a faster runoff response to rainfall occur probably due to shallow throughfall or overland flow which provides better drainage. The abandoned peat field no longer in cultivation continued to leach greenhouse gases in a same way as the Cultivated sites. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Natural peatlands are an important component of the global carbon cycle, representing a net long-term sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The natural carbon storage function of these ecosystems can be severely impacted due to Peatland drainage and peat extraction, leading to large and persistent sources of atmospheric CO2 following peat extraction abandonment. Standard restoration techniques aim to restore the peatland to a carbon-accumulating system through various water management techniques to improve hydrological conditions and through reintroducing Sphagnum at the surface. However, restoring the hydrology of peatlands can be expensive due to the cost of implementing the various restoration techniques. This study examines the net ecosystem CO2 exchange of a new extraction-restoration technique where the acrotelm is preserved and replaced directly on the cutover surface. Peat respiration at the experimental restored acrotelm (110.5 g C.m(-2) over the study period: May 20 - August 18) was significantly lower than at the natural peatland (144.8 and 203.7 g C.m(-2), wet and dry plots respectively). However, gross ecosystem production (GEP) at the experimental site was significantly reduced (-54.0 and -34.4 g C.m(-2)) compared to the natural site (-179.2 and -162.0 g C.m(-2)). Consequently, this was a growing season net emitter of CO2 to the atmosphere over the season at the experimental site (78.5 and 56.5 g C.m(-2)) and a growing season sink of CO2 at the natural site (-17.6 and -22.8 g C.m(-2)). Light response curves indicated that maximum GEP was significantly lower at the experimental site; however, it is likely that the percentage of living and dead vegetation at the plots post restoration had a large control on this lower productivity as plots with more living vegetation had higher overall productivity (GEP). Nevertheless, the experimental site did maintain limited productivity post-extraction, indicating that the carbon dynamics of the system was maintained due to this acrotelm restoration process, thereby likely returning the ecosystem toward a natural sink of atmospheric CO2 faster than natural rehabilitation and current restoration techniques. As such, this approach to peat extraction may be an environmentally preferred approach to use.

AB The response of free polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) in needles of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) to varying needle potassium concentrations was investigated in two potassium fertilization experiments on drained peatlands. A significant negative correlation was observed between putrescine and potassium concentrations in needles. Putrescine responded more sensitively to decreasing needle K concentrations during the growing season than during the winter. Putrescine accumulation started when needle potassium concentrations were above 5.5 mg g(dw)-1 in summer and above 5.0 mg g(dw)-1 in winter. A decrease in needle potassium concentrations below 4.3 mg g(dw)-1 in summer and below 3.5 mg g(dw)-1 in winter resulted in an exponential increase in putrescine concentrations. Putrescine accumulation was initiated well above the needle potassium concentrations generally considered indicative of deficiency. The exponential increase in putrescine concentrations in winter occurred within the range of needle potassium concentrations that has been identified as indicating severe potassium deficiency.

AB The density and diversity of spiders were compared in three periods: I - 1955, if - 1978-1983, III-1996-1998. The quadrat method was applied to estimate the density of spiders, and the Shannon-Wiener index was used to calculate species diversity. A decrease in spider species diversity, through time, was detected in managed grasslands. It was accompanied by a decrease in the number of families. This tendency was not found in natural fens. Spider density was similar in the compared periods. In period Ill, spider diversity and total density were positively correlated wit soil moisture, abundance of microhabitats in an area and landscape heterogeneity measured by the distance to shrubs. A negative correlation was found between the density of spiders and the intensity of management practice (mowing by heavy machines and grazing by cattle), and the bulk density of the soil. Plant diversity (H-4 based on the proportion of the area covered by each plant species) did not influence the diversity of spiders. The proportion of species connected exclusively with the field layer decreased with time. The effect of management on spider mobility was positive.

AB This study proposes a method for assessing the probability that land management interventions will lead to an improvement in the carbon sink represented by peat soils. The method is able to. combine studies of different carbon uptake and release pathways in order to assess changes on the overall carbon or greenhouse gas budget, calculate the probability of the management or restoration leading to an improvement in the budget; calculate the uncertainty in that probability estimate; estimate the equivalent number of complete budgets available from the combination of the literature; test the difference in the outcome of different land management interventions; and provide a method for updating the predicted probabilities as new studies become available Using this methodology, this study considered the impact of: afforestation, managed burning, drainage, drain-blocking, grazing removal; and revegetation. on the carbon budget of peat soils in the UK. The study showed that afforestation, drain-blocking, revegetation, grazing removal and cessation of managed burning would bring a carbon benefit, whereas deforestation, managed burning and drainage would bring a disbenefit.
   The predicted probabilities of a benefit are often equivocal as each management type or restoration often leads to increase in uptake in one pathway while increasing losses in another. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB The article outlines progress in Finnish forest research since Lauri Ilvessalo presented his review in 1927. Some fields of research which already possessed a firm basis 70 years ago are still found to be important. A number of studies had proved the suitability of Cajander's system of forest types for forest site classification; later research has mainly confirmed the validity of its use in Finnish conditions. The National Forest Inventory first carried out in the early 1920s has resulted in a continuous monitoring of forest resources. Data are now available for a wide range of forest and environmental applications. Research has also been an essential tool in helping Finnish forestry to meet new challenges. For example, the drainage of peatland forests and improved silviculture have resulted in great increase in forest production, while advances in forest technology have made efficient and environmentally friendly timber harvesting possible in new and sometimes difficult circumstances.

AB Over the last century, afforestation in Ireland has increased from 1% of the land area to 10%, with most plantations on upland drained blanket peatlands. This land use change is considered to have altered the hydrological response and water balance of upland catchments with implications for water resources. Because of the difficulty of observing these long-term changes in the field, the aim of this study was to utilize a hydrological model to simulate the rainfall runoff processes of an existing pristine blanket peatland and then to simulate the hydrology of the peatland if it were drained and afforested. The hydrological rainfall runoff model (GEOtop) was calibrated and validated for an existing small (76ha) pristine blanket peatland in the southwest of Ireland for the 2-year period, 2007-2008. The current hydrological response of the pristine blanket peatland catchment with regard to streamflow and water table (WT) levels was captured well in the simulations. Two land use change scenarios of afforestation were also examined, (A) a young 10-year-old and (B) a semi-mature 15-year-old Sitka Spruce forest. Scenario A produced similar streamflow dynamics to the pristine peatland, whereas total annual streamflow from Scenario B was 20% lower. For Scenarios A and B, on an annual average basis, the WT was drawn down by 16 and 20cm below that observed in the pristine peatland, respectively. The maximum WT draw down in Scenario B was 61cm and occurred in the summer months, resulting in a significant decrease in summer streamflow. Occasionally in the winter (following rainfall), the WT for Scenario B was just 2cm lower than the pristine peatland, which when coupled with the drainage networks associated with afforestation led to higher peak streamflows.

AB High concentrations of organophosphorous insecticides resulting from cranberry bog applications were detected in the Grayland Drainage Ditch (GDD) system in Grayland, Washington State, during the 1994-1996 Washington State Department of Ecology Pesticide Monitoring Program. This drainage ditch system drains cranberry bogs and enters the Pacific Ocean via the North Cove and Supon Inlet. Concerns about the impact of these pesticides on human and environmental health led to this investigation of the potential impact on an indicator species, Daphnia pulex. To determine the toxic effects of multiple pesticides entering the GDD, standardized laboratory toxicity tests with D. pulex were conducted concurrently with the Washington State Department of Ecology pesticide sampling. Concentrations of three insecticides, diazinon, chlorpyrifos, and azinphosmethyl, were the highest ever detected in state waters. The GDD water was found to cause acute toxicity in 33% of the laboratory bioassays conducted. Regression analysis, however, detected a poor correlation between total insecticide detected and percentage mortality of A pulex at the two drainage ditch sites studied, Grays Harbor County site and the Pacific County site. However, the relationship between mortality of A pulex and detected concentrations of diazinon and chlorpyrifos were significant. Sampling schedules for chemical analysis and bioassay testing appear to be the primary reason that statistical analysis failed to correlate mortality with detected OP pesticide concentrations. Grab samples used in toxicity testing may over- or underestimate actual concentrations of contaminants present in the system being studied. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

AB Wood ash (3.1, 3.3 or 6.6 tonnes dry weight ha(-1)) was used to fertilize two drained and forested peatland sites in southern Sweden. The sites were chosen to represent the Swedish peatlands that are most suitable for ash fertilization, with respect to stand growth response. The fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from the forest floor, measured using opaque static chambers, were monitored at both sites during 2004 and 2005 and at one of the sites during the period 1 October 2007-1 October 2008. No significant (p>0.05) changes in forest floor greenhouse gas exchange were detected. The annual emissions of CO2 from the sites varied between 6.4 and 15.4 tonnes ha(-1), while the CH4 fluxes varied between 1.9 and 12.5 kg ha(-1). The emissions of N2O were negligible. Ash fertilization increased soil pH at a depth of 0-0.05 m by up to 0.9 units (p<0.01) at one site, 5 years after application, and by 0.4 units (p<0.05) at the other site, 4 years after application. Over the first 5 years after fertilization, the mean annual tree stand basal area increment was significantly larger (p<0.05) at the highest ash dose plots compared with control plots (0.64 m(2) ha(-1) year(-1) and 0.52 m(2) ha(-1) year(-1), respectively). The stand biomass, which was calculated using tree biomass functions, was not significantly affected by the ash treatment. The groundwater levels during the 2008 growing season were lower in the high ash dose plots than in the corresponding control plots (p<0.05), indicating increased evapotranspiration as a result of increased tree growth. The larger basal area increment and the lowered groundwater levels in the high ash dose plots suggest that fertilization promoted tree growth, while not affecting greenhouse gas emissions.

TI COMPOSITION OF CARBON FRACTIONS AND POTENTIAL DENITRIFICATION IN DRAINED
   PEAT SOILS
SO JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The organic matter of five low-moor peat soils and one eutrophic raised-bog peat soil was chemically characterized by C fractionation and ion-exchange chromatography of amino acids and carbohydrates.  C fractions were related to potential denitrification, D(pot), as a measure of microbial activity and C availability, determined by the acetylene inhibition technique.  Chemical and physical properties vary distinctively between different kinds of peat, and show increasing C/N ratio and decreasing bulk density and ash content within the profile.  Generally, the carbon composition reflects the geobotanical origin of the peat.  In most samples more than 65% of organic C consists of non-hydrolysable C.  Readily hydrolysable neutral sugar C represents up to about 12% of organic C, usually decreasing with depth.  The recalcitrant fraction of neutral sugar C is much smaller (1 to 4.2% of organic C) and does not vary with depth.  The content of readily hydrolysable glucose exhibits a strong profile differentiation that decreases with depth whereas the higher contents of recalcitrant glucose carbon (12/0.5 M H2SO4) in the lower peat horizons reflect their cellulose character.  Regression analysis between D(pot) and single C components explains up to 51.5% of the variability.  Combining fractions which point to C availability (readily hydrolysable glucose) and microbial metabolism (amino acids), it is possible to estimate D(pot) with a certainty of more than 80%.

AB We aimed to determine the rate of subsidence of a peatland over 133 years since its drainage, and to evaluate the relative contributions of compaction and oxidation to this process. Reliable determination of this proportion is problematic. The results of our calculation were applied to estimate CO2 emissions by two approaches, assuming different oxidation fractions. The surface of the fen was lowered by 47.9 %, i.e. 2.0 cm year-1, of which about 60 % was due to oxidation and 40 % due to compaction. The process was more intense around a peat mining area, where the surface lowering was greater and the ratio of compaction to oxidation was about 30: 70. Our results for the share of oxidation were in line with values most often reported in the literature for warm temperate climate zones. Therefore, the method used for assessing it may be considered reliable.

AB Peat bogs represent unique ecosystems that are under particular threat from fragmentation due to peat harvesting, with only 38% of the original peatland in Europe remaining intact and unaffected by peat cutting, drainage and silviculture. In this study, we have used microsatellite markers to determine levels and patterns of genetic diversity in both cut and uncut natural populations of the peat moss Polytrichum commune. Overall diversity levels suggest that there is more genetic variation present than had previously been assumed for bryophytes. Despite this, diversity values from completely cut bogs were found to be lower than those from uncut peatlands (average 0.729 versus 0.880). In addition, the genetic diversity was more highly structured in the cut populations, further suggesting that genetic drift is already affecting genetic diversity in peat bogs subjected to fragmentation.

AB Fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) were measured on a drained and forested peatland in 1992-1995. Net mineralization and nitrification were studied in situ in 1993-1994. Nitrogen additions in 1992 as KNO3, NH4Cl, or urea (100 kg N.ha(-1)) were used to study the fate and transformations of N in peat. The mean N2O emissions during the growth season in 1993 were 1.9, 2.6, 3.3, and 3.5 mg N.m(-2).day(-1) in the control soil, KNO3, NH4Cl, and urea-treated soils, respectively. Mean NO fluxes during the growth season in 1993 averaged 0.3, 0.4, 0.7, and 0.6 mg N.m(-2).day(-1) in the control soil, KNO3, NH4Cl, and urea treatment, respectively. Annual net N mineralization was 87 kg N.ha(-1) in the control soil and 107, 129, and 91 kg.ha(-1) in the KNO3, NH4Cl, and urea-treated soils, respectively. Added N increased the fluxes of N oxides at least for a year after the treatments. The study showed that forests on drained N-rich peat soils may be significant sources of N2O and NO and that their production of nitrogenous trace gases is enhanced by additional N.

AB Throughout the world many extensive wetlands, such as the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California (hereafter, the Delta), have been drained for agriculture, resulting ill land-surface subsidence of peat soils. The purpose of this project was to study the in situ effects of wetland drainage oil the remaining peat in the Delta. Peat cores were retrieved from four drained, farmed islands and four relatively undisturbed, marsh islands. Core samples were analyzed for bulk density and percent organic Carbon. Macrofossils ill the peat were dated using radiocarbon age determination. The peat from the Canned islands is highly distinct from marsh island peat. Bulk density of peat From the farmed islands is generally greater than that of the marsh islands at a given organic carbon content. Oil the farmed islands. increased bulk density, which is, an indication of compaction, decreases with depth within the unoxidized peat zone, whereas, oil the marsh islands, bulk density is generally constant with depth except near the surface. Approximately 55-80% of the original peat layer oil the farmed islands has been lost due to land-surface subsidence. For the center regions of the farmed islands, this translates into an estimated loss of between 2900-5700 metric tons of organic carbon/hectare. most of the intact peal just below the currently farmed soil layer is over 4000 years old. Peat loss Will continue as long as the artificial water table oil the farmed islands is held below the land surface.

AB Rewetting of drained fens with NO3- enriched water from agricultural watersheds has been proposed as a valid strategy to reduce NO3- load of water courses although their role as dissolved nitrogen (DN) sinks remain unclear because the export of reduced nitrogen forms (NH4+, DON) may exceed NO3- removal. A laboratory experiment was conducted to investigate the importance of temperature, nitrogen load and the degree of peat decomposition on the role of rewetted fens as DN sinks. Different peat substrates of one degraded drained fen in NE Germany were incubated under stagnant water conditions. Two degrees of peat decomposition (Highly decomposed: HD; Moderately decomposed: MD), two nitrogen loads (Low nitrogen, LN, 40 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1); High nitrogen, HN, 140 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and two incubation temperatures (20 degrees C and 5 degrees C) were examined. Moreover, net N mineralisation and N microbial immobilisation were also estimated to gain useful insights on the role of the considered factors over processes involved on DN turnover. Under all scenarios considered in this study, fen rewetting was shown to be a valid strategy to recover the function of fens as DN sinks, although large variability on the retention efficiency was observed (similar to 15-75%). N load increased NO3- (LN: 7.9 +/- 1.0 mg N m(-2) d(-1); HN: 19.3 +/- 3.1 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) and DN (LN: 5.1 +/- 0.8 mg N m(-2) d(-1); HN: 16.5 +/- 2.4 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) removal, even though the depletion of the added NO3- by organic matter decomposition took place only at the peat surface. Peat decomposition strongly influenced DN turnover due to differences in the size of the mobile organic carbon (C) (HD: 132 +/- 7 mg c g(-1) dry matter (DM); MD: 68 +/- 2 mg C g(-1) DM) and N (HD: 9.3 +/- 0.5 mg N g(-1) DM; MD: 2.8 +/- 0.1 mg N g(-1) DM) pools. As a result, NO3- removal, net N mineralisation, N microbial immobilisation and NH4+ export were higher for highly decomposed peat. In addition, a higher incubation temperature increased NO removal rates (20 degrees C: 18.6 +/- 3.0 mg N m(-2) d(-1); 5 degrees C: 8.5 +/- 1.7 mg N m(-2) d(-1)). Moreover, DN removal was much higher at 20 degrees C (20 degrees C: 14.9 +/- 2.6 mg N m(-2) d(-1); 5 degrees C: 6.7 +/- 1.6 mg N m(-2) d(-1)), but lower than NO3- removal rates underpinning the importance of N mineralisation. The results from our study should be considered prior to restore degraded fens. Removing the highly decomposed peat layer, which has been proposed as a method to reduce nutrient release in rewetted fens, can hamper the N removal potential to some extent, especially at high N loading rates.

AB Litter quality and environmental effects on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) fine woody debris (FWD) decomposition were examined in three forestry-drained peatlands representing different site types along a climatic gradient from the north boreal (Northern Finland) to south (Southern Finland) and hemiboreal (Central Estonia) conditions. Decomposition (percent mass loss) of FWD with diameter <= 10 mm (twigs) and FWD with diameter > 10 mm (branches) was measured using the litter bag method over 1-4-year periods. Overall, decomposition rates increased from north to south, the rate constants (k values) varying from 0.128 to 0.188 year(-1) and from 0.066 to 0.127 year(-1) for twigs and branches, respectively. On average, twigs had lost 34%, 19% and 19%, and branches 25%, 17% and 11% of their initial mass after 2 years of decomposition at the hemiboreal, south boreal and north boreal sites, respectively. After 4 years at the south boreal site the values were 48% for twigs and 42% for branches. Based on earlier studies, we suggest that the decomposition rates that we determined may be used for estimating Scots pine FWD decomposition in the boreal zone, also in upland forests. Explanatory models accounted for 50.4% and 71.2% of the total variation in FWD decomposition rates when the first two and all years were considered, respectively. The variables most related to FWD decomposition included the initial ash, water extractives and Klason lignin content of litter, and cumulative site precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration. Simulations of inputs and decomposition of Scots pine FWD and needle litter in south boreal conditions over a 60-year period showed that 72 g m(-2) of organic matter from FWD vs. 365 g m(-2) from needles accumulated in the forest floor. The annual inputs varied from 5.7 to 15.6 g m(-2) and from 92 to 152 g m(-2) for FWD and needles, respectively. Each thinning caused an increase in FWD inputs, Up to 510 g m(-2), while the needle inputs did not change dramatically. Because the annual FWD inputs were lowered following the thinnings, the overall effect of thinnings on C accumulation from FWD was slightly negative. The contribution of FWD to soil C accumulation, relative to needle litter, seems to be rather minor in boreal Scots pine forests. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ongoing reclamation of boreal forest areas that are impacted by oil sands mining involves the construction of wetlands as desirable land uses. Constructed wetlands receiving peat-mining runoff are known to be major sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere. However, the GHG fluxes of a fen that is constructed with drained peat substrate and receives runoff containing effluents of salt and naphthenic acids is not known. Using a fen constructed in the post-mining landscape of the Athabasca oil sands region, a study was conducted to quantify the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) during the peak growing seasons over the first two years following revegetation. The specific objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of revegetation strategies and other environmental characteristics on the fen GHG emissions over the growing season. Relative to a natural fen, our results show significantly lower fluxes of CH4 (p < 0.001), which correlate with higher bulk density, lower organic matter content, and higher pH and SO42- concentration in the constructed fen. Revegetation did not stimulate CH4 production, but increased CO2 uptake and reduced N2O emissions relative to the non-vegetated control. These results suggest that revegetation strategies and water chemistry might be more important controls on GHG fluxes than substrate quality in a constructed fen. Although the current edaphic conditions in the constructed fen support the potential for a net uptake of GHGs over the growing season, additional monitoring is required to evaluate if these conditions will persist in the long-term. We recommend that future reclamation projects should consider the potential effects of construction materials on water chemistry prior to use in fen reclamation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB We studied carbon balances and carbon stocks of mountain rangelands and meadows in a network of 8 eddy covariance sites and 14 sites with biomass data in Europe. Net ecosystem exchange of pastures and extensively managed semi-natural rangelands were usually close to zero, while meadows fixed carbon, with the exception of one meadow that was established on a drained peatland. When we accounted for off-site losses and inputs also the carbon budget of meadows approached zero. Soil carbon stocks in these ecosystems were high, comparable to those of forest ecosystems, while carbon stocks in plant biomass were smaller. Since soil carbon stocks of abandoned mountain grasslands are as high as in managed ecosystems, it is likely that the widespread abandonment of mountain rangelands used currently as pastures will not lead to an immediate carbon sink in those ecosystems.

AB While streams draining peatland and wetland systems are known to be supersaturated in CO2 with respect to the atmosphere, relatively little is known about short-term temporal variability in response to extreme hydrological events. Here, we use submerged, nondispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors to make continuous measurements of CO2 concentrations during 18 storm events in a Scottish peatland stream. Individual storms exhibited 3 distinct types of hysteresis loop. We suggest that differences in loop form may be due to differences in the relative contributions of soil water or differences in the contributing catchment source area. We found a negative concentration-discharge relationship over the full study period, suggesting that CO2-rich deep peat/groundwater was the major source of aquatic CO2 under low flow conditions. By removing the effect of dilution and estimating additions and losses of CO2, we also show the importance of both surface peat CO2 inputs into the stream and evasion loss during stormflow. The best model of temporal variability in CO2 was achieved by separating the data set into "stormflow'' and "dry periods.'' Downstream CO2 export during the study period was dominated by stormflow events (71%), highlighting the importance of accurately accounting for high-flow CO2 sources.

AB Northern peatlands are important in the global carbon (C) cycle as they help regulate local, regional and global C budgets through high atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake and low net CO2 losses to the atmosphere. Since the 1900s (but particularly the 1950s) land-use change has affected many peatland areas, driven in part by attempts to improve their commercial value. During this period, many peatlands in the UK were drained and planted with non-native conifer plantations. Efforts are now underway to restore the ecosystem functioning of these peatlands to those characteristic of pristine peatlands, in particular C flux dynamics. A lack of ecosystem level measurements means that the timescales of restoration and the degree to which they are successful remains poorly determined. In this research, we present the first year-round study of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) from peatlands undergoing restoration from forestry. Annual NEE was measured from two sites between March 2014 and June 2015, where restoration commenced 10 years and 16 years prior to the start of this study, and the results were then compared to existing measurements from a near-pristine peatland. Existing NEE data (expressed as CO2-C) from the near-pristine peatland indicated a C sink of 114 g m(-2) yr(-1), and our estimates suggest that the older restored site (16 years) was also a NEE sink (71 g m(-2) yr(-1)). In contrast, the younger site (10 years) was a NEE source (80 g m(-2) yr(-1)). We critically assess the confidence of these measurements and also present these data in relation to other northern hemisphere peatlands to better understand the timeframe in which a peatland site can turn from a C source to a C sink after restoration.

AB Drained coastal peatlands are a source of greenhouse gas (GHG) through abundant CO2 release caused by aerobic peat degradation. Published rates of CO2, fixation and CH4, release for natural peatlands suggest that areas of peat formation are a (small) net source of GHG emission because the radiative effect of emitted CH4 exceeds the CO2 uptake by the vegetation. It is shown here that wetland restoration of reclaimed peat areas in the western Netherlands leads to a reduction of GHG emission because the expected increase in anaerobically generated CH4 release is much smaller than the decrease in aerobically produced CO2.

AB Calibration-period/control-area approach was used to study nitrogen and phosphorus export from drained and productive Norway-spruce-dominated peatland forests following conventional stem-only and whole-tree harvesting. The study indicated high nitrogen and particulate phosphorus exports and lack of significant differences between the harvest treatments during the first 3-4 years after harvesting. The high extra nitrogen exports, increasing to a maximum level of about 10 kg ha(-1) during the third year after harvesting, were partly caused by the higher nitrate export than in previous studies. The study has a practical outcome that management of harvest residues (i.e. left on site or harvested) may not be an efficient means of mitigation of nitrogen and phosphorus exports. The high exports following harvesting underline the importance of using the best available water protection methods, such as sufficiently large wetland buffer areas, to decrease nutrient exports to watercourses from productive Norway spruce dominated peatland catchments.

AB Several rivers around the Baltic Sea coast have poor water quality status due to occasional low pH and high metal concentrations. One potential cause of low pH is intensive drainage of shallow peat soils (<80 cm thick peat layer) overlying sulphide-rich sediments. This results in oxidation of iron sulphides to sulphuric acid, lowering water pH dramatically, and increases the concentrations of soluble toxic metals (e.g. Al, Cd, Ni, Zn). This study examined soil properties and hydrology in order to investigate the leaching of acidity derived from peatland forestry and devise potential ways to prevent acid leaching after drain maintenance work. Groundwater (GW) level, runoff amount and water quality were recorded at regular intervals for three small forested catchments (drained area 8.5-13 ha) during two growing seasons, 2010 and 2011. The soil was sampled and analysed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and sulphur. Undisturbed soil columns consisting of mineral subsoil were taken to the laboratory and exposed to lowered water levels in a controlled drainage experiment. The DRAINMOD model was used to simulate the impact of different drainage configurations. The simulation results suggest that the oxidation risk of sulphidic materials in subsoil during normal hydrological years is small in drained peatland forestry areas with a thick peat layer. The risk of oxidation of sulphidic materials increases during dry summers with a clear decline in GW level into the sulphidic subsoil. According to laboratory data, this can considerably lower the pH (down to 2.5) and increase metal concentrations (e.g. maximum Al, Cu and Zn concentrations of 1010, 257 and 186 mu g L-1, respectively) in runoff waters. However, with effective management methods these effects can be avoided. Changes in drainage practices (avoiding deep drainage) and controlled drainage may in some cases reduce the GW level drawdown and reduce the risk of sulphide oxidation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Retention of stormwater can in theory reduce peak flows, sediment and nutrient transport. This study presents results of peak runoff control (PRC) as a water protection method to decrease sediment and nutrient loads from drained peatland forestry in boreal conditions. Peak runoff rate and peak concentrations were reduced. The PRC method reduced suspended solids (SS) load (86%) by reducing flow velocities and improving settling conditions in the ditch network. The method had a considerable effect on SS-bound nutrients, reducing total nitrogen (N-tot) load by 65% and total phosphorus (P-tot) load by 67%. Reductions in velocity resulted in smaller particle size distributions in transported SS. No effect on groundwater elevation was observed and drainage conditions for forestry were maintained. The results clearly show that the PRC method can be used efficiently in peatland forestry as a water protection method to improve water quality. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two field expeditions in 1996 studied (CS)-C-137 intake patterns and its content in the bodies of adult residents from the village Kozhany in the Bryansk region, Russia, located on the shore of a drainless peat lake in an area subjected to significant radioactive contamination after the 1986 Chernobyl accident. The (CS)-C-137 contents in lake water and fish Were two orders of magnitude greater than in local rivers and flow-through lakes, 10 years after Chernobyl radioactive contamination, and remain stable. The (CS)-C-137 content in lake fish and a mixture of forest mushrooms was between approximately 10-20 kBq/kg, which exceeded the temporary Russian permissible levels for these products by a factor of 20-40. Consumption of lake fish gave the main contribution to internal doses (40-50%) for Kozhany village inhabitants Simple countermeasures, such as Prussian blue doses for dairy cows and pre-boiling mushrooms and fish before cooking, halved the (CS)-C-137 internal dose to inhabitants, even 10 years after the radioactive fallout.

AB The global loss of peatlands, by drainage or peat extraction, has encouraged measures to restore these ecosystems and their function as carbon sinks. However, there is a potential of high emissions of the potent greenhouse gas CH4 from restored peatlands. Vascular plants, which often dominate restored sites, play a key role in determining the amount of emitted CH4: The plants can either fuel methanogenesis by supplying labile carbon or attenuate methanogenesis by transferring oxygen into the rhizosphere. To quantify the net effect of these counteracting processes, we tested in a two-pronged approach CH4 production, emission, and the underlying processes in (1.) monoliths of three different restored cutover peatlands and in (2.) mesocosms with Eriophorwn vaginatwn, E. angustifolium and Juncos effusus versus controls with Sphagna and bare peat. Despite waterlogged, and thus persisting anoxic conditions, concentrations of dissolved CH4 remained close to zero in all tested monoliths. We ascribe this finding to two factors: The poor decomposability of the peat material, as determined in anoxic incubations, and the availability of alternative electron acceptors that sustained anaerobic respiration and competitively suppressed methanogenesis. While inorganic electron acceptor pools were small and rapidly diminished, dissolved organic matter provided constant electron acceptor capacity, indicating that reducible moieties in the organic matter were continuously re-oxidized in the rhizosphere of all tested vascular plant species. This continuous re-oxidation of the dissolved organic matter correlated with plant growth rates (R-2 = 0.6-0.8), suggesting that supply of oxygen through the aerenchyma of plant roots regenerated electron acceptor capacity in the rhizosphere. Vascular plants may have differential effects on the net ecosystem exchange, however, our findings suggest that CH4 concentrations and emissions may remain low in restored cutover peatlands for months to years. Thus, waterlogging and vascular plant cover of degraded cutover peat lands does not necessarily create hot-spots of CH4 emissions.

AB Peatlands store vast amounts of carbon (C) within the global terrestrial biosphere. Drainage and cultivation of peat soils lead to rapid soil degradation and C losses, and this may worsen under warming as the soils are no longer protected by anaerobic conditions. To predict the rates of soil C loss and design effective mitigation strategies, it is important to understand what controls organic matter mineralization in these soils. Using the 0-10 cm soil depth of thick and thin (degraded) agricultural peat soils, we investigated the fate of low molecular weight organic substrates (LMWOS) and how the microbial biomass consuming these substrates responded to temperature. We incubated the soils under increasing temperatures (4, 10, 20, and 30 degrees C) for 72 h. Either C-14-labelled glucose or amino acids were added to the soils and their speed of breakdown, partitioning into anabolic/catabolic processes and microbial C use efficiency (CUE) were determined. The total (CO2)-C-14 loss from soil increased significantly with increasing temperature during 72-h incubation, regardless of peat layer thickness. Warming altered the dynamics of LMWOS mineralization by changing C allocation and the turnover rate of different microbial C pools. The half-life of LMWOS decreased more than 50% when temperature increased from 4 to 30 degrees C for both substrates. CUE was always higher for thin than thick peat soil and both declined by 0.002-0.005 degrees C-1 with increasing temperature. Thin peat decreased substrate C allocation into the fast cycling C pool compared to the thick peat, but had no overall effect on pool turnover rate. Our work suggests that climate warming will accelerate C mineralization and soil loss in drained peat soils, with larger effects expected in thick peat soil. This study provides an important initial step in characterizing the response of the microbial utilization of labile C to temperature change and soil degradation in cultivated peatlands.

AB Purpose Boreal peat soils comprise about 3% of the terrestrial environments, and when drained, they become sources of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Ammonia oxidation can result in N2O emissions, either directly or by fuelling denitrification, but we know little about the ecology of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) in peat soils. Our aim was to determine temporal alterations in abundance and composition of these communities in a drained and forested peat soil in relation to N2O emissions and ammonia oxidation activity.
   Materials and methods The peat was sampled at three different depths in the upper 0.5 m over a period of 9 months covering two summer and two winter samplings. Community composition and abundance were determined by T-RFLP and quantitative real-time PCR of the bacterial and archaeal amoA genes. Potential ammonia oxidation rates were measured using the chlorate inhibition technique, and in situ N2O emission was determined using chambers.
   Results and discussion The soil parameters displayed little spatial and temporal heterogeneity, which probably explained why there were no depth-related effects on the abundance, composition, or activity of the ammonia oxidizers. In contrast to most terrestrial environments, the AOB dominated numerically over the AOA. Both groups changed in community composition between sampling occasions, although the AOB showed more significant seasonal signatures than the AOA. Temporal changes in abundance were only observed for the AOB, with a decrease in numbers from May to March. Such differences were not reflected by the activity or N2O emissions.
   Conclusions The high ammonium concentrations in the peat soil likely favored the AOB over the AOA, and we hypothesize that they were more active than the AOA and therefore responded to climatic and environmental changes. However, other processes rather than ammonia oxidation were likely responsible for N2O emissions at the site.

AB Since the 1990s, many peatlands that were drained for peat extraction and agriculture in Russia have been abandoned with high CO2 emissions and frequent fires, such as the enormous fires around Moscow in 2010. The fire hazard in these peatlands can be reduced through peatland rewetting and wetland restoration, so monitoring peatland status is essential. However, large expanses, poor accessibility, and fast plant succession pose as challenges for monitoring these areas without satellite images. In this study, a technique involving multispectral satellite data was used to identify six land cover classes that meet the requirements for peatland monitoring using the Meschera National Park as the testing area. This park is the largest area of once-exploited and now rewetted peatlands. However, data from one scanner are often insufficient to successfully implement this technique. In this study, we compared the land cover classifications obtained by using data from Spot-5, Spot-6, Landsat-7, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 satellites. The Spot-6 data were insufficient, despite having a higher spatial resolution, due to the lack of a shortwave infrared (SWIR) band. The high classification accuracy attained using data from other sensors enabled their combined use to provide an acceptable accuracy in the final product. The classification results were compared using minimum distance Erdas Imagine and the object-oriented ScanEx Image Processor, and the classification accuracy was similar between satellite images, which facilitates the transition from one method to another without quality loss. The proposed and tested approach can be used to analyze the status of abandoned and rewetted peatlands in other locations for the inventory and prioritization of sites for rewetting and restoration, monitoring status changes, and assessing restoration efficacy. The comparability of the data from different sensors allows for the combination of classified images and creates new possibilities for time series analysis.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine how drainage impacts carbon densities and recent rates (past 50years) of vertical accretion and carbon accumulation in southeastern forested peatlands. We compared these parameters in drained maple-gum (MAPL), Atlantic white cedar (CDR), and pocosin (POC) communities in the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge (GDS) of Virginia/North Carolina and in an intact (undrained) CDR swamp in the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge (AR) of North Carolina. Peat cores were analyzed for bulk density, percent organic carbon, and Cs-137 and Pb-210. An uncertainty analysis of both Cs-137 and Pb-210 approaches was used to constrain error at least partially related to mobility of both radioisotopes. GDS peats had lower porosities (89.6% (SD=1.71) versus 95.3% (0.18)) and higher carbon densities (0.082 (0.021) versus 0.037 (0.009)gCcm(-3)) than AR. Vertical accretion rates (0.10-0.56cmyr(-1)) were used to estimate a time period of similar to 84-362years for reestablishment of peat lost during the 2011 Lateral West fire at the GDS. Carbon accumulation rates ranged from 51 to 389gCm(-2)yr(-1) for all sites. In the drained (GDS) versus intact (AR) CDR sites, carbon accumulation rates were similar with Cs-137 (87(GDS) versus 92(AR)gCm(-2)yr(-1)) and somewhat less at the GDS than AR as determined with Pb-210 (111(GDS) versus 159(AR)gCm(-2)yr(-1)). Heightened productivity and high polyphenol content of peat may be responsible for similar rates of carbon accumulation in both drained and intact CDR peatlands.

AB Drainage of peat soils for agriculture can lead to large carbon losses due to oxidation of peat. We estimated peat subsidence rates and total carbon losses, due to 40 years of dairy farming on a former peat bog, by measuring the thickness of peat and total carbon of farmland and of an adjacent unmodified peat bog above a marker tephra layer that was deposited about 200 AD. Subsidence rates averaged 3.4 cm yr(-1) (95% confidence interval of 3.2 to 3.5 cm yr(-1)) and carbon loss averaged 3.7 t ha(-1) yr(-1) (95% confidence interval of 2.5 to 5.0 t ha(-1) yr(-1)). On average, 63% of the subsidence was due to consolidation, with the remainder (37%) attributed to losses of organic matter due to peat mineralization.

AB Mineral-N dynamics have been measured over a period of 3 years in PK- and NPK-treated plots (4 m2) laid out on an area of poorly drained, reseeded, blanket peat in the north of Scotland. Mineral-N, present in the peat almost entirely as NH4+, accumulated in winter, reaching 42 kg N ha-1 in the Surface 10 cm in April before the application of 112.5 kg N ha-1 as NH4NO3 or urea. In situ incubation of peat cores isolated to prevent leaching, and with grass tops removed, confirmed that net mineralization occurred between November and April, with the greatest rate, 1.2 kg N ha-1 day-1, recorded between March and April. During the period May to early June, immobilization of N predominated and rates of net immobilization ranged between 0.2 and 0.8 kg N ha-1 day-1. This coincided with a poor uptake into herbage, less than 16% of soil mineral N and fertilizer NH4NO3 in June of the first 2 years. The largest counts (most probable number) of ammonifying bacteria in the surface 5 cm were recorded in July for aerobes (27.1 x 10(9) litre-1) and August for anaerobes (7.1 x 10(9) litre-1). N fertilizer increased these counts significantly (P < 0.05) to 56 x 10(9) aerobes and 13 x 10(9) anaerobes. During July and August, in 2 out of the 3 years, mineralization predominated over immobilization and mean net rates of up to 0.9 kg N ha-1 day-1 were recorded.

AB Peatlands are large repositories of atmospheric carbon and concern has been raised over the stability of this carbon store because increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations have been observed in peatland drainage waters. A number of potential causes have been proposed in the literature, and conflicting results among studies conducted at different spatial and temporal scales suggest that the methodological approach may be an important confounding factor. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of moisture and temperature on DOC release from a south-central Ontario peatland during the fall (a major export period) following three commonly used approaches: laboratory microcosms. an intensive field study and analysis of long-term data (1980-2008). The effect of variations in temperature and moisture differed among microcosm, field study and analysis of the long-term record. Water content was important at the microcosm scale as DOC concentration and aromaticity increased with peat water-saturation. Drought caused a decrease in DOC concentration and pH, and an increase in sulphate and base cation concentrations. In contrast, the field study indicated that DOC concentration was strongly associated with temperature, and weakly correlated (negatively) with stream discharge. Average fall DOC concentration (but not export) increased over the 29 year record, and was correlated with fall discharge and precipitation (negative) and summer precipitation and fall stream pH (positive). As no common strong predictor of fall DOC was found at three scales of investigation at a single, well-studied site, it may be unreasonable to expect to identify a universal driver behind the widespread increase in DOC concentration.

AB Fens belong to the most threatened ecosystems in Europe. Maintaining a high water table through rewetting is an effective measure to rehabilitate many of their ecosystem functions. However, the impact of meteorological conditions such as vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and precipitation on water tables is still unclear for rewetted fens. Here, we compare the impact of meteorological factors on water table dynamics in a drained and a rewetted fen, using multiple regression with data from continuous high-resolution (temporal) water level monitoring and weather stations. We find that an increase in the daily mean VPD causes a higher drop in the water table at the drained and degraded fen compared to the rewetted fen. Precipitation contributes to recharge, causing the water table to rise higher at the drained site than at the rewetted site. We attribute the differential influence of meteorological conditions on water table dynamics to different soil specific yield values (i.e., water storage capacity) largely driven by lower water table position at the drained site. Our study underlines the importance of understanding how and why water tables in peatlands vary in response to meteorological factors for management decisions (e.g., rewetting). Continuous monitoring of water table and vegetation development in rewetted fen peatlands is advisable to ensure long-term success especially under climate change conditions and associated drought events.

AB Numerous studies have dealt with carbon (C) contents in Histosols, but there are no studies quantifying the relative importance of the individual C components in pore waters. For this study, measurements were taken of all the carbon components (particulate organic carbon, POC; dissolved organic carbon, DOC; dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC; dissolved methane, CH4) in the soil pore water of calcareous fens under three different water management regimes (rewetted, deeply and moderately drained). Pore water was collected weekly or biweekly (April 2004 to April 2006) at depths between 10 and 150 cm.
   The main results obtained were: (1) DIC (94 280 mg C l(-1)) was the main C-component. (2) POC and DOC concentrations in the pore water (14-125 mg Cl-1 vs. 41-95 mg C l(-1)) were pari passu. (3) Dissolved CH4 was the smallest C component (0.005-0.9 mg C l(-1)). Interestingly, about 30% of the POM particles were colonized by microbes indicating that they are active in the internal C turnover. Certainly, both POC and DOC fractions are essential components of the C budget of peatlands. Furthermore, dissolved CO2 in all forms of DIC appears to be an important part of peatland C-balance.

ID RESTORATION; MANAGEMENT
AB In the Boreal region, anticline eskers aquifers are recharged in upland hillslopes and water discharges in the surrounding lowlands. Organic peat soils often confine the aquifer discharge area and drainage of these confining peat layers can decrease the flow resistance in the peat soil, which may cause unintentional groundwater level drawdown. This poses a risk to groundwater bodies and their good water status in the Boreal region. To increase awareness of the risk areas and to assess potential areas for drainage restoration, a model based on geographical information systems (GIS) was developed to predict the locations of high groundwater discharge. The output of the model is a map highlighting the potential areas where groundwater is more likely to discharge. The model output was validated with stream flow data collected from two eskers located in Finland. The developed GIS model is recommended as a tool to delineate groundwater protection areas where drainage of the peat soil should not be allowed and for assessing areas where such drainage networks could be restored to protect vulnerable groundwater systems.

AB Vegetation rehabilitation of harvested peat fields is globally important because it facilitates the restoration of natural biodiversity. The objective of this study was to determine the occurrence of mosses, lichens and arthropods in blueberry plantations of differing age on an abandoned peat production area. In the experiment, two lichen and five moss species were detected in total. By contrast, only one species, a moss, was found on a non-vegetated, abandoned peat area. Although the total number of lichens and mosses was not high, it varied significantly according to lowbush blueberry age. It was higher in 5-7-year old plantations with no significant differences with a natural, drained bog. As plant cover by cultivated blueberry plants increased up to 99% in the 13-year plantation, the presence of non-vascular plants diminished. The total number of arthropods depended on the age of the blueberry plantation and was lowest in the non-vegetated, abandoned peat area. Plantation age influenced arthropod abundance in both experimental years. More beneficial or neutral arthropods were found in bog and 6- and 7-year old plantations, while phytophagous arthropods predominated in older plots. Dominating beneficial arthropod groups in both years were Araneidae, Thomisidae, Lycosidae, Collembola, Formicidae and Carabidae. The growing of lowbush blueberry may become one option for the vegetation restoration of abandoned peatlands and the plant cover it provides serves as a suitable habitat for various arthropods.

AB Responsible forest management requires accounting for adverse environmental effects, such as increased nutrient export to water courses. We constructed a spatially-distributed nutrient balance model NutSpaFHy that extends the hydrological model SpaFHy by introducing a grid-based nutrient balance sub-model and a conceptual solute transport routine to approximate total nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) export to streams. NutSpaFHy uses openly-available Multi-Source National Forest Inventory data, soil maps, topographic databases, location of water bodies, and meteorological variables as input, and computes nutrient processes in monthly time-steps. NutSpaFHy contains two calibrated parameters both for N and P, which were optimized against measured N and P concentrations in runoff from twelve forested catchments distributed across Finland. NutSpaFHy was independently tested against six catchments. The model produced realistic nutrient exports. For one catchment, we simulated 25 scenarios, where clear-cuts were located differently with respect to distance to water body, location on mineral or peat soil, and on sites with different fertility. Results indicate that NutSpaFHy can be used to identify current and future nutrient export hot spots, allowing comparison of logging scenarios with variable harvesting area, location and harvest techniques, and to identify acceptable scenarios that preserve the wood supply whilst maintaining acceptable level of nutrient export.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations and export were analyzed throughout a 67 km(2) boreal stream network in northern Sweden. 700 DIC and CO2 samples from 14 subcatchments were collected in 2006 and 2007. All sites were consistently supersaturated in CO2 with respect to the atmosphere. Temporal variability of DIC and CO2 concentration was best correlated with discharge, with concentrations generally diluting at high discharge. However, the variability in CO2 concentration was also dependent on the specific pH range of the stream, as variability was greatest in acidic headwater streams and lowest in larger circumneutral streams. In the larger ones the increase in the CO2 proportion of DIC at increased discharge counteracts the dilution of CO2. The shift toward proportionally more CO2 of the DIC at higher discharge is caused by decline in pH. Spatial patterns showed that DIC and CO2 concentrations were best correlated with peatland coverage of the subcatchment. The highest concentrations were found in headwater streams draining peatlands. The downstream export of DIC from the catchment outlet constitutes 19% of the total downstream export of carbon (DIC + DOC), or 0.7 (+/-0.09) g C m(-2) yr(-1). This study demonstrates the importance of including fluvial fluxes of inorganic carbon in landscape carbon budgets via runoff, and also highlights the need to account for stream evasion of CO2 to the atmosphere in such estimates since it can be larger than the downstream DIC export.

AB Lake Gosciaz is located in the zone of the maximum extent of the last ice sheet. Distinct lake terraces and deposits related to the lateglacial transgression do not exist. Detailed examination of annually laminated sediments and landforms revealed three phases of higher water level and storage, represented by shore features, by littoral, deltaic and bog deposits, and by higher rates of lacustrine deposition in the pelagic zone. Holocene lake transgressions at c. 8.4-7.7 ka, 2.5-2.3 ka, and less distinct at 5-4 ka BP coincide with phases of higher flood frequency in Poland and glacial advances in the Alps. Because of sedimentation, isolation from groundwaters, encroachment by peatland and drainage of the lake, lake volume during the last 12 ka diminished by as much as 70%, and current water-level fluctuations of about 1-2 m can change water storage by 20-25%.

AB For centuries European peatlands have been degrading along with drainage, land use and climate changes. Increasing pressure on peatland ecosystems calls for a more cost-efficient method to indicate the current state of peatlands and the success of restoration efforts. Metabolic pathways in peatland soils are imprinted in stable isotope compositions due to differences in microorganism communities and their metabolic pathways. Therefore, we hypothesize that depth profiles of nitrogen stable isotope values provide a promising opportunity to detect peatland decomposition or restoration. We studied five peatlands, namely Degern Stormyr (northern Sweden), Lakkasuo (central Finland) and three mires in the Black Forest (southern Germany). At all locations, cores were taken from adjacent drained (or rewetted) and natural sites to identify delta N-15 trends that could indicate changes due to drainage and restoration. At all drained (and rewetted) sites we found a distinct peak ("turning point") of the delta N-15 values in the center of the drained horizon. We did a fatty acids (FAs) analysis to link our results to microbial community composition. As markers, we distinguished between one fungal-derived FA (C18:2 omega 9c) and four bacterial-derived FAs. For bacteria, we looked for one general bacterial-derived FA (C14:0), two FAs for gram-positive bacteria (i-C15:0; a-C15:0), and one FA for gram-negative bacteria (C16:1 omega 9c). In accordance with other studies, our results suggest that fungi dominate the microbial metabolism in the upper aerobic peat horizon. This is reflected by depleted delta N-15 values. Moving downwards, the drained horizon conditions slowly switch to oxygen limitation. Consequently, fungal-derived FAs decrease whereas bacterial-derived FAs rise. The highest diversity of microbial-derived FAs is indicated by the delta N-15 turning point. Below the delta N-15 turning point, oxygen is increasingly limited and concentrations of all microbial-derived FAs are decreasing down to the onset of the permanently waterlogged anaerobic horizon. Peatland cores with restoration successes again show, above the formerly drained horizon, no depth trend of the isotopic values. Hence, we conclude that delta N-15 stable isotope values reflect microbial community composition, which differs between drained and natural peatlands.

AB Peat soils represent a highly significant carbon store and are usually assumed to serve as net sinks within carbon budgets for climate modelling. However, marked increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in upland peat drainage waters over the past few decades are widespread in England. This suggests that the assumed sink status of some upland peats could be changing, although, as these observations are seldom quantified into actual carbon flux measurements, their overall importance is difficult to gauge. We investigated the fluvial export of the humic component of DOC (hDOC) from 3 South Pennine catchments and found that the actual carbon export via this pathway has doubled over the last 3 decades. Temperature increases to date appear poorly related to this change. Declining sulphur deposition was more strongly related (inversely), but was not a significant determinant in any of the catchments. The major driver for elevated hDOC export appears to be changes in local land management, namely the extensive use of burning for grouse moor management. Substitution of increased hDOC export into published carbon budget models for upland peat environments imply the study sites have shifted from carbon sinks to net sources over the examined period. This suggests that moorland burning, where undertaken on blanket peat, is incompatible with the ecosystem services these landscapes are presumed to provide and that ideas about the role of upland peat moorland in regional and national carbon cycling need reappraisal.

   ecosystems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY

DT Article
ID MIRE; COAL
AB Although no precise modern analogue exists for the peat-forming ecosystems (mires) of Tertiary times, it is argued that the principles underlying peat formation are essentially unchanged in the sense that a peat-forming ecosystem has an incomplete decomposition process (normally because of waterlogging) , leaving a residue of organic material in its overall energy-Row budget. The study of modern mires is therefore of relevance to Tertiary coal geologists, The classification of modern mires is best achieved by reference to their hydrological characteristics, particularly the source of water entering the system. Flow-fed (rheotrophic) mires are often relatively rich in nutrients and elastic, while rainfed (ombrotrophic) mires are poor. The transition from one hydrological state to the other can occur during mire development and involves a physical elevation of the mire surface by the growth of peat.
   Such mires have a two-layered (diplotelmic) structure in which the surface layer (acrotelm) is periodically aerobic, has a loose structure and a high hydraulic conductivity, while the lower layer (catotelm) is compacted, anaerobic and has a low hydraulic conductivity. The hydrological outcome is that precipitation landing upon a raised, ombrotrophic mire drains from the elevated mire surface laterally through the acrotelm. The water retention of the mire and its elevated water table is dependent on the poor water conductivity of the catotelm. The transition to the ombrotrophic condition is accompanied by higher rates of pear accumulation and increasing mire acidity. It begins with isolated colonization of hummock-forming plants that later converge into an extended cupola. This ecological transition may be a consequence of external changes, such as climatic alteration (increased precipitation: evaporation ratio) or autogenic, internal successional developments. Basin subsidence, however, or eustatic sea-level rise in the case of coastal systems, can operate in the reverse direction and prevent the permanent establishment of an ombrotrophic system.
   The ombrotrophic mire is ultimately limited in the depth of its pear development by microbial respiration within the catotelm. As the catotelm extends with pear accumulation, the total respiratory activity of the profile will equilibrate with primary productivity and peat formation slows down to an eventual standstill. On the assumption that peatland hydrology operated in a similar way in former times, the deep peats (and eventually coals) of Tertiary times can best be explained, therefore, in terms of stacks of sequential mires rather than single, continuously forming ecosystems.

AB Fens are underestimated carbon sinks. Knowledge about their role in the sequestration of CO2 in the past is limited. The research reported here focused on identifying long-term carbon accumulation rates (CARs) in a drained fen (Bagno Bruch) and a waterlogged fen (Bagno Mikoeska) in southern Poland. On the basis of Pb-210 and AMS C-14 dates and age-depth modeling, 7000- and 2000-year records of changes in bulk composition and carbon and sulfur content are presented and discussed. Strong human impact is detected, especially in Bagno Bruch. However, minor climatic signals linked to the Little Ice Age' and to the influence of wind-blown sands are also evident. The sand may have influenced the plant composition, peat accumulation rates (PARs), and CARs, in addition to the bulk composition at Bagno Mikoeska. The mean value of the CAR in the youngest peat layers spanning the last 200years is generally lower in two cores from Bagno Bruch (c. 85 and 86g/m(2)/yr) than in two cores from Bagno Mikoeska (c. 140 and 142g/m(2)/yr). The fens are characterized by higher CARs compared with boreal peatlands. The reproducibility of the CAR values is the most promising result, suggesting the low mobility of Pb-210 and the reliability of this method in assessing the chronology of fens.

AB There is a limited understanding of solute transport properties of degraded peat soils as compared to mineral substrates. A lower organic matter (OM) content is often the result of peat degradation and mineralization following artificial drainage. In this study, we aimed at deducing changes in solute transport properties of peat soils differing in OM content. Miscible displacement experiments were conducted on 70 undisturbed soil columns with OM contents ranging from 11 to 86% w/w under saturated steady-state conditions using tritium and bromide as conservative tracers. Measured breakthrough curves (BTCs) were subjected to model analysis using three different approaches: single-porosity model (SPM), mobile-immobile model (MIM), and two-flow region model (TFRM). The results indicated that (i) nonequilibrium solute transport processes are common in peat soils; (ii) the TFRM improved predictions of BTCs with heavy tailing or two peaks; (iii) applied tracers, tritium and bromide, were retarded in peat soils with higher OM content; and (iv) pronounced preferential flow mainly occurred in peat soils with lower OM content. This type of strong preferential flow had a small ratio of measured to fitted pore water velocity and a greater ratio of velocities (v(A)/v(B) > 3.0) in the fast and slow transport region as obtained from the TFRM. We conclude that shallow groundwater resources are more likely to become polluted in drained and degraded fen peats that are used for agricultural purposes.

AB Yamulki and co-authors address in their recent publication the important issue of net emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from peatlands where land use conversion has taken place. In their case, they studied conversion to forestry versus peatland restoration after a first rotation of plantation forestry. They monitored soil-derived fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) using opaque chamber measurements on planted and unplanted control treatments (with or without drainage), and an unplanted plot within a restored (felled) block on former lowland raised bog. They propose that their measurements of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at these sites suggest that the total net GHG emissions, in 100 yr carbon dioxide equivalents, of the restored peat bog would be higher than that of the peat bog with trees. We believe there are a number of issues with the measurement, calculation and comparison of these greenhouse budgets that may invalidate this conclusion.

AB At sites with either peat or mineral soils in large areas of boreal forests, high soil-water contents hamper tree growth and drainage can significantly increase growth. Hence, areas covering about 15 x 10(6) ha of northern peatlands and wet mineral soils have been drained for forestry purposes. Usually ditches gradually deteriorate, thus reducing their functionality as drains, and ditch-network maintenance (DNM) might be needed to maintain stand growth rates enabled by the original ditching. This article reviews current knowledge on establishing the need for DNM in boreal forest stands, subsequent growth responses, and the financial outcome of the activity. The issues covered in the review are: (i) ditching, changes in ditches over time and the need for DNM; (ii) interactions between soil water and both stand properties and stand management; (iii) ground-water level (GWL) and tree growth responses to DNM; and (iv) financial viability of DNM. Conclusions about the current understanding of issues related to DNM are drawn and implications for DNM in practice are summarized. Finally, gaps in knowledge are identified and research needs are suggested.

TI Erodibility of hill peat
SO IRISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE peat erodibility; sedimentology; sustainable farming
AB The energy necessary to entrain soil in water depends on the soil strength. Once entrained, the settling velocity of the eroded soil in water is of fundamental importance to the processes of sediment transport and deposition. In this paper, stream power theory and transport concepts coupled with the equation of continuity were used to derive a transport-limited peat concentration. The ratio of the log of the actual sediment concentration in surface run-off to the log of the transport-limited sediment concentration was the index of erosion used. The value of this index is a measure of the sensitivity of peat to erosion by sheet flow. Four peats were subjected to a range of overland flow rates under two slopes in a laboratory flume. The peats represented peat farmed in a sustainable manner (Leenane), overgrazed peat (Maam), peat undergoing erosion (Newport) and peat which had undergone weathering following exposure by a landslip (Croagh Patrick). Both in situ and surface damaged slabs were studied. The results indicate that shearing and remoulding of a wet peat surface (e.g., by animal treading) and weathering of exposed drained peat surfaces predispose peat to erosion. Defoliation by overgrazing is considered to be of secondary importance.

TI Some critical questions concerning the restorability of damaged raised

SO APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Atmospheric pollutant; Peat extraction; Raised bog; Restoration
AB . In principle, the restoration of damaged raised bogs has rather few requirements: (1) a sufficient supply, and retention, of precipitation water of appropriate quality; and (2) the availability of a suitable range of recolonist species. However, to meet these requirements it may be necessary to engineer the topography of the peatland and drainage systems and to adopt a policy of species introduction. This paper provides a critical summary review of: (1) existing knowledge about the environmental conditions necessary for the effective regeneration of damaged ombrogenous peatlands; (2) approaches adopted for generating conditions appropriate for the re-establishment of plant species typical of raised bogs; (3) possible external constraints (especially atmospheric contaminants) upon the feasibility of restoration; and (4) the prospects and possibilities for effective species recolonization. Particular attention is given to the identification of uncertainties and critical gaps in existing knowledge about raised bog restoration and of some of the natural processes that help regulate the development of raised bogs.

   CONSEQUENCES
AB In intact raised bog landscapes transitions from ombrotrophic into minerotrophic conditions occur. These gradients are lost from many bogs due to peat harvesting and drainage, and are difficult to restore. To determine which endangered species are characteristic of pristine raised bog gradients and their current status in degraded bogs, plants and macroinvertebrates were surveyed in Estonian intact raised bogs and Dutch degraded bog remnants. Dutch national distribution data were used to determine whether communities with these species occurred outside bog habitats. Water chemistry data were used to describe associated environmental conditions. Intact bog gradients were the preferred habitat for six plant species and fifteen macroinvertebrate species, all of which are endangered. In degraded bogs these species were scarce or not recorded. In intact bogs these species lived at sites where runoff from the bog massif came into contact with regional ground water resulting in a gradient in pH, alkalinity, Ca, Fe and ionic ratio. Analysis of Dutch national distribution data revealed aggregations of these endangered species in moorland pools. These pools contained water chemistry gradients similar to those found in pristine bogs, which occurred at sites were groundwater seepage and stream water came in contact. In the past, stream water has been used to increase pH and trophic status of moorland pools facilitating fisheries. Today, this practice offers a conservation strategy for the protection of endangered species for which no short-term alternatives are available. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Drainage and shrub expansion are the main threats to the biodiversity of fens and fen meadows, whereas rewetting and the removal of shrubby species are frequently applied restoration measures. We examine whether removal of shrubs enhances recovery of target species in a degraded fen subjected to moderate rewetting. The study was located in the drained fen Calowanie (central Poland), where remnants of open fen communities and willow-invaded fens exist in former turf-pits, surrounded by degraded meadows on dried peat. All these three habitat types were included in a monitoring grid, which covered an area of 2.2 ha. Within 55 quadrats of 20 m x 20 m we monitored occurrence of 52 species, i.e. two groups of target species (fen indicators and wet meadow indicators) and indicators of two failure scenarios (degraded fen indicators and eutrophic wetland indicators), during sixy ears following shrub removal, rewetting and re-application of conservational mowing, using a 3-step ordinal abundance scale. NMDS ordination revealed a gradual convergence of shrub removal plots and reference plots. We noticed significant effects of year and habitat type on all indicator groups, but only fen indicators have shown a clear (increasing) trend within shrub removal plots. Degraded fen indicators (ruderal and opportunistic species) initially expanded on shrub removal plots, but this effect disappeared in the following years. We conclude that shrub removal enhances establishment of target species in a moderately drained and then rewetted fen and attribute this effect to lowered competition for light. However, given high costs of this method and long-lasting problems with shrub resprouts, we recommend applying shrub removal only to recently overgrown sites, which still retained high botanical diversity. Heavily degraded fen meadows did not react on the increase of moisture, which indicates that more advanced restoration measures, such as top soil removal are needed there. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

AB We studied twelve late Holocene organic deposits in West-Frisia, The Netherlands. Pollen, spores, non-pollen palynomorphs, mosses, other botanical macrofossils and insect remains were recorded for reconstructions of changing environmental conditions. Eastern West-Frisia was a cultivated landscape during the Bronze Age, but it became a freshwater wetland in the Late Bronze Age. In most of our sites, radiocarbon dates show that time transgressive inundation of soils preceded the climate shift at 850 cal BC for several centuries. We suggest that solar forcing of climate change may have delivered the final push to the inundation and depopulation of West-Frisia, which had already commenced several centuries before, due to sealevel rise. We did not find evidence for significant Bronze Age tree growth in West-Frisia before the inundations. Vegetation successions in the new wetlands developed from shallow mineral-rich freshwater to rich-fen vegetation. Subsequently poor fen vegetation with birch and pine developed, and the natural succession led to ombrotrophic raised bog vegetation. Complete successions from shallow, mineral-rich lakes to raised bog lasted between 1000 and 1500 calendar years. We hypothesize that medieval drainage and reclamation became possible only when the mires of West-Frisia had reached the raised bog stage. Reclamation of raised bogs by medieval farmers (drainage, eutrophication, peat digging) caused compaction, oxidation and loss of the upper part of the peat deposit. Seeds of salt-tolerant and salt-demanding plant species indicate that the medieval sites were inundated during storm surges with brackish or salt water, which triggered the farmers to build artificial mounds and, later, dikes. Under mounds and dikes, peat deposits remained protected against further decay. With our data we deliver a long-term perspective on contemporary ecosystem dynamics of freshwater wetlands, relevant for nature conservation and future climate change.

AB Organic-rich wetland soils in the histosol soil order represent the largest soil carbon (C) pool globally. Carbon accumulation in these ecosystems is largely due to oxygen (O-2) limitation of decomposition. Increased O-2 availability from wetland drainage and climate change may stimulate C decomposition overall and affect the balance of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) greenhouse gas release. Characterizing relationships, including non-linearity, between soil O-2 and C gas emissions is therefore critical to predict the partitioning and rate of C release from histosols under greater O-2 availability. We varied gas-phase O-2 concentration from 0.03 to 20 % in incubations of a sapric histosol and measured resulting CO2 and CH4 emissions. Efflux of CO2 increased and CH4 emissions decreased at higher O-2 concentrations, and rates were best described by log-linear model fits. The non-linear response of CO2 and CH4 emissions to O-2 concentration indicates that moist, C rich histosols may be highly sensitive to increases in O-2 availability, even below concentration thresholds typically classified as anoxic.

AB This study is concerned with an initial investigation of anthropogenically altered runoff processes in a head-water catchment within the National Park Hunsruck-Hochwald (Germany) that is characterized by slope bogs and waterlogged soils. The examined area is crossed by a dense network of trenches, which were established in the course of forestry operations in order to utilize these waterlogged areas. An evaluation of the drainage network's influence on runoff processes is attempted using water gauges and GIS-based analyses of the subcatchments. Results of the water year 2016 and a heavy rainfall event show that gauges in the study area react quickly to precipitation inputs and that water is retained only for a short time. The magnitude of runoff recession even in short dry spells permits the conclusion that the already merely residual slope bogs are endangered. The partial results of this study can serve as an instrument for rewetting actions as they allow spatially and temporally high resolved statements about the influence of drainage networks.

AB We determined the fluxes of total mercury (HgT), total organic carbon (TOC), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from five upland/peatland watersheds at the watershed outlet. The difference between TOC and DOC was defined as particulate OC(POC), Concentrations of HgT showed moderate to strong relationships with POC (R-2 = 0.77) when all watersheds were grouped, Although POC only accounts for 10 to 20% of the OC transported, we estimate that it is associated with 52 to 80% of the HgT transported from the five watersheds. Total transport of HgT from the watersheds ranged from 0.70 to 2.82 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) Watershed geometry and hydrology play important roles in determining the influence of OC on HgT transport in forested watersheds. Watershed properties such as peatland area have considerable promise as predictors for estimating HgT transport in streams draining forested watersheds in the Great Lakes States.

AB Extreme summer droughts are expected to occur more often in the future in NW Europe due to climate change. These droughts might accelerate the rate of peat oxidation in drained peat areas, with impacts on soil subsidence, GHG emission and water quality. This study aimed at providing more insight in the oxidation of deep peat layers that had not previously been exposed to air, the so-called secondary decomposition.
   We incubated two types of peat (eutrophic and oligotrophic), sampled from permanently anoxic peat layers from nature reserves and agricultural peat meadows. Peat samples were incubated for thirteen weeks under anoxic conditions, but were exposed to air for one to eight weeks. The production of CO2 and CH4 was quantified as a proxy for decomposition; concentrations of soluble nutrients and phenolic compounds were also measured.
   The results showed that oxygenation led to a steep increase in the rate of decomposition, indicated by higher carbon loss rates during and after oxygenation compared to non-oxygenated samples. Carbon loss rates increased more for eutrophic peat (agricultural area: 352%, nature reserve: 182%) than for oligotrophic peat (83% and 159% respectively). Most peat samples investigated showed higher post-oxygenation CO2 and/or CH4 production compared to the anoxic pre-oxygenation period. This indicates that oxygenation stimulates decomposition, even after anoxic conditions have returned. Contrary to the enzymic latch theory, no effects of oxygenation on the concentrations of soluble or condensed phenolic compounds were detected. Soluble nutrient concentrations did not change due to oxygenation either. Noteworthy is the occurrence of pyrite mineralization and associated acidification in eutrophic peat. Thus, low summer water levels, for example due to climate change, should be avoided in order to limit exceptionally high decomposition rates and associated problems such as increasing subsidence rates, greenhouse gas emission, sulfate release and acidification.

AB In order to support the conservation of bog ecosystem over its geographic range and its genetic diversity, marginal areas of lower quality as a result of damage or degradation which abut active raised bogs may need to be included, protected and, where practicable, regenerated. There are very few intact or near-intact raised bogs in Europe, except in Finland and Sweden where active raised bogs are the predominant mire complex type in hemiboreal and southern boreal regions (European Commission, 2013). Leaf area index is an important parameter as it emblematize vegetation. After the construction of drainage, bogs usually become overgrown with trees, the restoration of the ecosystem requires vegetation manipulation. There are many degraded bogs in Estonia and Latvia that have overgrown with trees, and this type of simulation model would help to calculate the right tree cutting intensity to reduce the impact of evaporation and interception of trees on the water balance of the bog, thereby contributing to the restoration of the bogs. This article describes the case study of Mannikjarve's bog where system dynamics simulation model for decision-making, built in Stella Architect environment, was validated.

AB The rewetting of drained peatlands alters peat geochemistry and often leads to sustained elevated methane emission. Although this methane is produced entirely by microbial activity, the distribution and abundance of methane-cycling microbes in rewetted peatlands, especially in fens, is rarely described. In this study, we compare the community composition and abundance of methane-cycling microbes in relation to peat porewater geochemistry in two rewetted fens in northeastern Germany, a coastal brackish fen and a freshwater riparian fen, with known high methane fluxes. We utilized 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on 16S rRNA, mcrA, and pmoA genes to determine microbial community composition and the abundance of total bacteria, methanogens, and methanotrophs. Electrical conductivity (EC) was more than 3 times higher in the coastal fen than in the riparian fen, averaging 5.3 and 1.5 mS cm(-1), respectively. Porewater concentrations of terminal electron acceptors (TEAs) varied within and among the fens. This was also reflected in similarly high intra- and inter-site variations of microbial community composition. Despite these differences in environmental conditions and electron acceptor availability, we found a low abundance of methanotrophs and a high abundance of methanogens, represented in particular by Methanosaetaceae, in both fens. This suggests that rapid (re) establishment of methanogens and slow (re) establishment of methanotrophs contributes to prolonged increased methane emissions following rewetting.

AB Peatlands are lands with a peat layer at the surface, containing a large proportion of organic carbon. Such lands cover approximate to 1 000 000 km(2)in Europe, which is almost 10% of the total surface area. In many countries, peatlands have been artificially drained over centuries, leading to not only enormous emissions of CO(2)but also soil subsidence, mobilization of nutrients, higher flood risks, and loss of biodiversity. These problems can largely be solved by stopping drainage and rewetting the land. Wet peatlands do not release CO2, can potentially sequester carbon, help to improve water quality, provide habitat for rare and threatened biodiversity, and can still be used for production of biomass ("paludiculture"). Wisely adjusted land use on peatlands can substantially contribute to low-emission goals and further benefits for farmers, the economy, society, and the environment.

AB The properties of wood and wood tracheids from trees growing in peatland stands are still insufficiently known. The long-term effects of thinning on wood and tracheid properties of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were investigated in two thinning experiments on peatland sites in central Finland. The two sites were ditched for the first time in 1958 and 1973, and thinning experiments were established in 1987 and 1993, respectively. Thinning increased the basal area increment of the remaining trees by 20 per cent. No differences between the trees that were growing on the thinned plots and those that were growing on the unthinned control plots were found in the latewood proportion, wood density, tracheid diameter, cell wall thickness and tracheid length. Moreover, the wood and tracheid properties did not differ markedly from those of corresponding material originating from mineral soil sites. The results confirm the previous results on mineral soils, which showed that an increasing availability of resources primarily increases the rate of tracheid production but has no major effects on wood and tracheid properties.

AB Since the last deglaciation, 300-500 Pg carbon have accumulated in northern peatlands (346 mill. ha). While sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2), these peatlands release considerable amounts of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. The greenhouse-gas balance of peatlands may change in the future if summers become warmer and drier, as has been predicted for high latitudes. Subsequent emissions of CH4 would decrease, whereas emissions of CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O) would increase. Water-level drawdown has been predicted to enhance the greenhouse impact from northern peatlands. The components of carbon cycling were measured both in undrained and drained peatlands of different trophic levels, The results were drawn together into a single radiative forcing factor, to assess the combined atmospheric effects of water-level drawdown. We present a hypothesis, based on the measured changes in carbon stores in soil and tree stand, and fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O after water-level drawdown caused by drainage for forestry. The hypothesis suggests that possible drying arising from climate change would, in fact, decrease the impact of northern peatlands on the total radiative forcing for about one hundred years by c. 0.1 W m(-2). This is caused by the decrease in CH4 emissions, fairly small changes in the peat carbon storage, and increase in the tree-stand biomass storage.

AB Feat soils with high nitrogen content are potential sources of nitrous oxide (N2O). Fluxes of nitrous oxide were measured in situ on nine virgin and ten drained peatlands of different hydrology and nutrient status. Numbers of nitrifying bacteria were estimated in different layers of the peat profiles with a most-probable-number technique. Nitrification potentials were determined in soil slurries of pH 4 and 6 from the profiles of six peat soils. Many virgin peatlands showed low N2O uptake. Lowering of the water table generally increased the average fluxes of N2O from the soils, although more in minerotrophic (nutrient rich) than in ombrotrophic (nutrient poor) sites. Ammonium oxidizing bacteria were found on only two sites but nitrite oxidizers were detected in almost all peat profiles. More nitrite oxidizers were found in drained than in virgin pear profiles. Nitrification was enhanced after lowering of the water table in minerotrophic peat but not in ombrotrophic peat. The N2O fluxes correlated positively with the numbers of nitrite oxidizers, nitrification potential, N, P and Ca content and pH of the soil and negatively with the level of water table (expressed as negative values) and K content of the soil.

TI Human-caused avulsion in the Rhine-Meuse delta before historic

SO GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID HOLOCENE; SUBSIDENCE; EVOLUTION
AB Although the shifting of deltaic river branches (avulsion) is a natural process that has become increasingly influenced by humans, the impact of early human activities as a driver of avulsion success has remained poorly explored. This study demonstrates how two important avulsions in the downstream part of the Rhine-Meuse delta, The Netherlands, were stimulated by human activities in the first millennium CE, before historic embankment constrained the river courses. Peatland reclamation induced land subsidence in the lower delta. This effect, together with a human-induced increase in suspended fluvial sediments and tidal backwater effects, allowed for a gradual ingression of tidal creek channels and progradation of fluvial crevasse channels into human-occupied and drained peatlands, where they eventually connected. We reconstructed the initial situation and identified the feedback loops among overbank sedimentation, tidal incursion, and land drainage subsidence that led to avulsion success. The processes and feedbacks resulting from human activities are generic and hence relevant to many other deltas today where human-induced subsidence results in tidal ingression, potentially connecting to rivers and causing unexpected avulsions.

AB Peatlands are large terrestrial stores of carbon, and sustained CO2 sinks, but over the last century large areas have been drained for agriculture and forestry, potentially converting them into net carbon sources. More recently, some peatlands have been re-wetted by blocking drainage ditches, with the aims of enhancing biodiversity, mitigating flooding, and promoting carbon storage. One potential detrimental consequence of peatland re-wetting is an increase in methane (CH4) emissions, offsetting the benefits of increased CO2 sequestration. We examined differences in CH4 emissions between an area of ditch-drained blanket bog, and an adjacent area where drainage ditches were recently infilled. Results showed that Eriophorum vaginatum colonization led to a "hotspot'' of CH4 emissions from the infilled ditches themselves, with smaller increases in CH4 from other re-wetted areas. Extrapolated to the area of blanket bog surrounding the study site, we estimated that CH4 emissions were around 60 kg CH4 ha(-1) y(-1) prior to drainage, reducing to 44 kg CH4 ha(-1) y(-1) after drainage. We calculated that fully re-wetting this area would initially increase emissions to a peak of around 120 kg CH4 ha(-1) y(-1), with around two-thirds of the increase (and 90% of the increase over pre-drainage conditions) attributable to CH4 emissions from E. vaginatum-colonized infilled ditches, despite these areas only occupying 7% of the landscape. We predicted that emissions should eventually decline toward pre-drainage values as the ecosystem recovers, but only if Sphagnum mosses displace E. vaginatum from the infilled ditches. These results have implications for peatland management for climate change mitigation, suggesting that restoration methods should aim, if possible, to avoid the colonization of infilled ditches by aerenchymatous species such as E. vaginatum, and to encourage Sphagnum establishment.

AB Ditch network maintenance (DNM) is implemented on 60 000 ha annually in Finland to sustain timber productivity on drained peatlands. We investigated how different DNM strategies influence the total ditching area, timber production, financial feasibility, and sediment and nutrient loading in the South-West Finland (SWF) and Northern Ostrobothnia (NO) regions. The National Forest Inventory sample plot data were entered into a stand simulator and simulations were carried out over a 100-year period. In the Passive DNM strategy (ditches maintained only at forest regeneration), the total ditching area was 72-85% lower compared with the Intensive strategy (DNM always when ditches are in poor condition) or 62-80% lower compared with the Conditional strategy (DNM only when ditches are poor and standing volume is below a specific value). Conditional and Intensive strategies resulted in higher cutting removals than the Passive strategy (8-9% in SWF and 21-22% in NO) due to faster stand development, but the respective loads of suspended solids (SS) and phosphorus were two-to three-fold higher in SWF and four-to six-fold higher loads in NO. Overall, the Conditional strategy showed the best performance generating the highest net present value, higher cutting removals than in the Passive strategy, and lower nutrient and SS loads than in the Intensive strategy.

AB Research carried out at the 'Czarne Bagno' raised mire in the Bystrzyckie wills range of Poland's Sudety Mountains aimed to determine dynamic trends for the site's peatland vegetation. resent vegetation was therefore characterized. An analysis of plant macroremains from peat cores was used to reconstruct the identity of the past peat-forming plant communities. Several succession stages of vegetation from the time of origin of the peatland through to the present day were indicated on this basis. Ecological indicative values of plant species were also used to determine the palaeohydrological changes experienced. Stages of the development of the tree stand growing on the mire were established from dendrochronology series. Results obtained point to an interruption of the succession of primary vegetation on the peatland around 250 years ago, when today's sparse tree stand of rhaetic pine, Norway spruce and downy birch began to develop. Nevertheless, the last 50 years have brought a reversal of this developmental trend, with elements typical for raised mire returning and the tree stand in retreat. These phenomena seem to have coincided with the onset of peatland drainage, followed by a gradual overgrowing of drainage ditches and consequent re-raising of water level in the mire, respectively.

DE requirement specification; object-oriented analysis and design;
   simulation modelling; bog restoration; input data
AB Within the scope of biodiversity and sustainable ecosystem development, the restoration of a bog' s ecosystem is important because by reducing the drainage effect on the bog, the negative impact on adjacent intact or relatively intact raised bog and other wetland hydrological regime is lowered. Degraded bogs are mires with a disturbed natural hydrological regime, or those partly exploited for peat extraction. However, the hydrological regime can be restored and peat formation is expected within 30 years. The restoration of a bog's hydrological regime can be accelerated by filling up the drainage ditches. In the course of researching scientific literature, the author has found no evidence of a system dynamics model developed to simulate tree cutting intensity in degraded bogs after filling the drainage ditches for the purpose of speeding up the restoration of hydrological regime. Developing system dynamics model to calculate tree cutting intensity is an innovative way of solving the problem. Specification requirement technique is a useful tool for determining the elements that shape a bog's hydrological system and interact with each other, thus providing the design for a simulation model. The next step of the research, following the specification of the requirements, will be the development and verification of the simulation model using real life data.

AB The present study is focused on Potamogeton polygonifolius - the species considered to be endangered in Germany, the Czech Republic, Poland and Switzerland. Field studies were carried out in Lower Silesia and Lusatia in southwestern Poland in order to verify the present state of the marginal populations of P. polygonifolius, to determine the habitat preferences of the species in the study area, to compare the ecological data between marginal and central populations and finally to recognise the factors constraining the easternmost limit of the P. polygonifolius. In total, 18 populations were examined, and 11 releves were collected. The releves gathered were compared with 95 releves made in northwestern Germany, and with 10 releves collected in the German part of Lusatia. There were no significant differences between the ecology of populations of P. polygonifolius on the eastern edge of its range and those in the central part. P. polygonifolius was found growing both in natural habitats like unspoiled peat bogs, and in anthropogenic habitats such as exploited peat bogs and drainage ditches. In both types of habitats its populations were abundant and competent in terms of generative propagation. The lack of geographical barriers as well as biology and fitness of P. polygonifolius individuals from the study area suggest that marginal populations are possibly a part of a large metapopulation, covering the whole (Polish and German) area of Lusatia, however, this hypothesis was not tested in detail. The main factor shaping the easternmost limit of the general range of P. polygonifolius is most likely climate, which prevents P. polygonifolius from spreading farther eastwards.

AB As an important nutrient reservoir, the mires in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China have been suffering from large-scale agriculture reclamation since the 1960s. The effects of the long-term reclamation on the dynamics of the dissolved nutrients in fluvial systems are revealed through surveying the export concentrations of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus in the natural mire, degraded mire and drainage ditches during the growing seasons in 2009 and 2010. The results show that the mean concentrations of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN, 2.03 +/- 0.355 mg l(-1)) are much higher in natural mire than in degraded mire (1.15 +/- 0.247 mg l(-1)) and ditches (1.03 +/- 0.231 mg l(-1)), and the fraction lessened is primarily the organic part of nitrogen. It indicates that the long-term mire reclamation has led to a significant reduction in TDN concentrations in the surface fluvial system, and has changed the dominant nitrogen components from organic to inorganic formation. In comparison, the concentrations of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) have no significant difference between natural mire and degraded mire or ditches, which demonstrates that mire reclamation has no impact on TDP export dynamics in the fluvial system. The seasonal dynamics of TDN are strongly correlated to dissolved organic carbon at almost all the sample sites, and mire reclamation does not alter the C : N ratio in the fluvial system, but lowers N : P ratio remarkably. The long-term reclamation exerts distinctly different effects on the export dynamics of TDN and TDP in the fluvial system in the Sanjiang Plain. Specific goals and methods ought to be determined if ecological management and recovery measures are to be carried out.

AB Around the world many peatlands are managed unsustainably. Drainage of the peat causes soil subsidence and a range of negative societal impacts. Integrated strategies are required to ensure more sustainable long-term settings, based on impact assessment models that simulate the interrelated dynamics of water management and soil subsidence, and determine the spatial and temporal range of societal impacts. This paper presents an integrated modelling framework that meets these requirements. We used the framework to assess the impacts of a range of water management strategies in Dutch peatlands. Average soil subsidence rates were shown to range from 0.6 to 4.5 mm.y(-1), resulting in marked differences in societal impacts that affect stakeholders unequally. Moreover, the impacts on real estate damage and water system maintenance revealed inverse trends that result in increasingly unbalanced cost-benefit ratios. The generated insights led the regional water authority to change their current water management strategy, preventing unsustainable future developments. We find the results relevant for improving stakeholders' awareness of long-term impacts of management strategies, and making negotiation processes on goals, means, and possible future pathways more transparent.

AB Organic matter and nutrient export from drained peatlands is affected by complex hydrological and biogeochemical interactions. Here partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to relate various soil and catchment characteristics to variations in chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in runoff. Peat core samples and water quality data were collected from 15 peat extraction sites in Finland. PLSR models constructed by cross-validation and variable selection routines predicted 92, 88, and 95% of the variation in mean COD, TN, and TP concentration in runoff, respectively. The results showed that variations in COD were mainly related to net production (temperature and water-extractable dissolved organic carbon (DOC)), hydrology (topographical relief), and solubility of dissolved organic matter (peat sulfur (S) and calcium (Ca) concentrations). Negative correlations for peat S and runoff COD indicated that acidity from oxidation of organic S stored in peat may be an important mechanism suppressing organic matter leaching. Moreover, runoff COD was associated with peat aluminum (Al), P, and sodium (Na) concentrations. Hydrological controls on TN and COD were similar (i.e., related to topography), whereas degree of humification, bulk density, and water-extractable COD and Al provided additional explanations for TN concentration. Variations in runoff TP concentration were attributed to erosion of particulate P, as indicated by a positive correlation with suspended sediment concentration (SSC), and factors associated with metal-humic complexation and P adsorption (peat Al, water-extractable P, and water-extractable iron (Fe)).

AB Restoration of wetlands is a high priority world-wide. Peat extraction areas can be restored by rewetting, however affecting the environment. It could be expected to turn the drained peat-cutover area from a source to a sink of most elements. This study examined effects of such rewetting on peat, hydrology and water chemistry over 15 years at two sites in Sweden; the nutrient-poor Porla peatland and the nutrient-rich Vastkarr peatland. Rewetting caused minor changes to peat chemistry, but at the Vastkarr site ammonium concentrations increased in superficial peat layers while nitrate decreased. In terms of hydrology, rewetting of the Porla site decreased annual runoff and both high and low discharges. Water pH at the Porla site stayed fairly stable, but at the Vastkarr site pH, after an initial 4 years dip, gradually increased to higher values than before rewetting. Water colour and organic matter content were fairly stable, but slightly lower values were found after 15 years than in initial 4-5 years. The concentrations of base cations and of inorganic N were lower after rewetting, while total P was higher. However, these impacts could change from an initial phase as the wetlands in the long-term perspective develop into mires.

AB Fen peatlands are specific wetland ecosystems containing high soil organic carbon (SOC). There is a general lack of knowledge about the microbial communities that abound in these systems. We examined the microbial activity and community structure in two fen soils differing in SOC content sampled from the Ljubljana Marsh under different seasonal conditions. Substrate-induced respiration and dehydrogenase activity were used as indicators of total microbial activity. Both methods indicated higher microbial activities in the fen soil with the higher SOC content on all dates of sampling. To determine whether the differences in microbial activity were associated with differences in the microbial community structures, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of bacterial 16S rRNA genes was performed. Comparison of the T-RFLP profiles revealed very similar community structures in both fens and in the two seasonal extremes investigated. This suggested a stable community structure in the two fens, which is not affected by the SOC content or seasonal variation. In addition, a bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene based clone library was prepared from the fen soil with the higher SOC content. Out of 114 clones analysed, approximately 53% belonged to the Proteobacteria, 23% to the Acidobacteria, 21% to a variety of other taxa, and less than 3% were affiliated with the Firmicutes.

AB We conducted a (CO2)-C-13 pulse-chase labelling experiment in a drained boreal organic (peat) soil cultivated with perennial crop, reed canary grass (RCG; Phalaris arundinacea) to study the flow of carbon from plants to soil microbes. Both limed and unlimed soils were studied, since liming is a common agricultural practice for acidic organic soils. Soil samples taken within three months after the labelling and three times in the following year were used for the delta C-13 analysis of microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), root sugars and root lipids. We estimated the contribution of carbon from root exudates to microbial PLFA synthesis. The flow of carbon from plants to microbes was fast as the label allocation in PLFAs had a peak 1-3 days after labelling. The results showed that fungi were important in the incorporation of fresh, plant-derived carbon, including root sugars. None of the main microbial PLFA biomarker groups (fungi, Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) was completely lacking label over the measurement period. One year after the labelling, when the labelled carbon was widely distributed into plant biomass and soil, bacterial biomarkers increased their share of the label allocation. Liming had a minor effect on the label allocation rate into PLFAs. The mixing model approach used to calculate the root exudate contribution to microbial biomass resulted in a highly conservative estimate of utilization of this important C-source (0-6.5%, with highest incorporation into fungi). In summary, the results of this study provide new information about the role of various microbial groups in the turnover of plant-derived, fresh carbon in boreal organic soil. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Incipient warming of peatlands at high latitudes is expected to modify soil drainage and hence the redox conditions, which has implications for Fe export from soils. This study uses Fe isotopes to assess the processes controlling Fe export in a range of Icelandic soils including peat soils derived from the same parent basalt, where Fe isotope variations principally reflect differences in weathering and drainage. In poorly weathered, well-drained soils (non-peat soils), the limited Fe isotope fractionation in soil solutions relative to the bulk soil (Delta Fe-57(solution-soil) = -0.11 +/- 0.12%) is attributed to proton-promoted mineral dissolution. In the more weathered poorly drained soils (peat soils), the soil solutions are usually lighter than the bulk soil (Delta Fe-57(solution-soil) = - 0.41 +/- 0.32%), which indicates that Fe has been mobilised by reductive mineral dissolution and/or ligand-controlled dissolution. The results highlight the presence of Fe-organic complexes in solution in anoxic conditions. An additional constraint on soil weathering is provided by Si isotopes. The Si isotope composition of the soil solutions relative to the soil (Delta Si-30(solution-soil) = 0.92 +/- 0.26%) generally reflects the incorporation of light Si isotopes in secondary aluminosilicates. Under anoxic conditions in peat soils, the largest Si isotope fractionation in soil solutions relative to the bulk soil is observed (Delta Si-30(solution-soil) = 1.63 +/- 0.40%) and attributed to the cumulative contribution of secondary clay minerals and amorphous silica precipitation. Si supersaturation in solution with respect to amorphous silica is reached upon freezing when Al availability to form aluminosilicates is limited by the affinity of Al for metal-organic complexes. Therefore, the precipitation of amorphous silica in peat soils indirectly supports the formation of metal-organic complexes in poorly drained soils. These observations highlight that in a scenario of decreasing soil drainage with warming high latitude peatlands, Fe export from soils as Fe-organic complexes will increase, which in turn has implications for Fe transport in rivers, and ultimately the delivery of Fe to the oceans.

AB Organic carbon and iron transport into the Gulf of Bothnia and the seasonal changes in the nature of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were studied in 1983 and 1984 at the mouth of the River Kiiminkijoki, which crosses an area of minerotrophic mires in northern Finland. Organic and inorganic transport within the drainage basin was studied in the summer and autumn of 1985 and 1986, and information was also acquired on the nature of DOM by gel filtration in river, brook and peat mining water. The river water is organically coloured, with high organic matter, Fe concentrations and transport rates, while the values for phosphorus and nitrogen are low. The organic carbon concentrations increase with discharge with the major organic load restricted to the time of spring floods. The results indicate that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is mainly of terrestrial origin, leaching mostly from peatlands. Autochthonous DOC sources seem also to be important in summer. The DOC concentrations decrease under low flow conditions probably mainly due to sedimentation and decomposition of humic substances. The proportion of drifting algae as a particulate organic carbon (POC) source seems to increase in summer. The changes in the ratio of Fe/DOC, the colour of the DOM and the ratio of fluorescence to DOC with discharge give indications of the origin, formation, nature and fate of the DOM in the river water. Temperature-dependent microbiological processes in the formation and sedimentation of Fe-organic colloids seem to be important. Estimates are given for the amounts and transport rates of organic carbon and Fe discharged into the Gulf of Bothnia by river. High apparent molecular weight (HAMW) organic colloids are important for the organic, Fe and P transport in the basin. The gel filtration data suggest that the DOM in the water consists mainly of fulvic acids, although humic acids are also important. The apparent molecular weight of the DOM is higher than in the lakes in the area of ombrotrophic peatlands in southern Finland. Colour in this humic water increases with DOC and Fe concentrations. The results indicate an increase in the mobilization of HAMW Fe-organic colloids in the peatlands following drainage and peat mining. The transport of inorganic nitrogen from the peatlands in the area and in the river is increasing due to peat mining. The corresponding changes in the transport of organic matter, Fe and P are less marked but point in a similar direction.

AB Temperate forests can contain large numbers of wetlands located in areas of low relief and poor drainage. These wetlands can make a large contribution to the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) load of streams and rivers draining the forests, as well as the exchange of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) with the atmosphere. We studied the carbon budget of a small wetland, located in Kejimkujik National Park, Nova Scotia, Canada. The study wetland was the Pine Marten Brook site, a poor fen draining a mixed hardwood-softwood forest. We studied the loss of DOC from the wetland via the outlet stream from 1990 to 1999 and related this to climatic and hydrologic variables. We added the DOC export information to information from a previously published model describing CH4 and CO2 fluxes from the wetland as a function of precipitation and temperature, and generated a new synthesis of the major C losses from the wetland. We show that current annual C losses from this wetland amount to 0.6% of its total C mass. We then predicted that under climate changes caused by a doubling of atmospheric CO2 expected between 2040 and 2050, total C loss from the wetland will almost double to 1.1% of total biomass. This may convert this wetland from what we assume is currently a passive C storage area to an active source of greenhouse gases, Crown Copyright (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Greenhouse Gas Abatement in Norwegian Agriculture: Costs or Benefits?
SO EUROCHOICES
LA English
DT Article
AB Agriculture, which currently accounts for 0.3 per cent of Norway's gross domestic product, is estimated to generate roughly 13 per cent of the country's emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Norway has proposed a reduction of 40 per cent in its total emissions in the run up to the international climate change conference in Paris in December 2015. High levels of protection mean that Norway is a closed economy as far as agriculture is concerned. Agriculture is also highly subsidised. We estimate a marginal abatement cost curve for agriculture. Since producers, consumers and taxpayers would all be affected if emissions reductions are imposed on agriculture, we calculate abatement costs in terms of national economic welfare. We find that a cut of around 30 per cent in emissions from agriculture can be achieved, without undermining the stated policy objective of ensuring a minimum supply of domestically-produced calories, by taking drained peatland out of production and restoring it to wetland. Progressing beyond a 30 per cent reduction requires a more fundamental restructuring of production away from emissions-intensive ruminants and towards less emissions-intensive crop and livestock products. Emissions reductions of over 60 per cent can be achieved with no reductions in national economic welfare, due to reductions in agricultural subsidies.

AB In 2008 a calcareous mound fen not listed in the state Natural Heritage Inventory was discovered in south-central Wisconsin. Air photo interpretations and interviews with land users indicated two distinct major historical alterations to this fen: (1) drainage tiling without widespread soil disturbance and (2) plowing with or without direct drainage. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination of survey plots revealed that an assemblage of calciphiles, fen indicators, and wetland generalists persisted in the mound's center, while invasive herbaceous and woody vegetation reached highest cover along the disturbed flanks. Cluster analyses revealed three distinct communities: (1) a fen meadow in the center of the fen, (2) invading shrub-carr in tiled areas, and (3) a weedy/invasive herbaceous community where soil disturbance was widespread. This study lends support to past assertions that drainage can lead to shrub-carr invasion and suggests that widespread soil disturbance can lead to domination by herbaceous invasive plants on fen flanks.

AB New raw materials for transportation fuels need to be introduced, in order to fight against climate change and also to cope with increasing risks of availability and price of oil. Peat has been recognised suitable raw material option for diesel produced by gasification and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. The energy content of Finnish peat reserves is remarkable. In this study, the greenhouse impact of peat-based FT diesel production and utilisation in Finland was assessed from the life-cycle point of view. In 100 year's time horizon the greenhouse impact of peat-based FT diesel is likely larger than the impact of fossil diesel. The impact can somewhat be lowered by producing peat from the agricultural peatland (strong greenhouse gas emissions from the decaying peatlayer are avoided) with new peat production technique, and utilising the produced biomass from the after-treatment area for diesel also. if diesel production is integrated with pulp and paper mill to achieve energy efficiency benefits and if the electricity demand can be covered by zero emission electricity, the greenhouse impact of peat-based FT diesel reduces to the level of fossil diesel when agricultural peatland is used, and is somewhat higher when forestry-drained peatland is used as raw material source.

AB Middle Pleistocene deposits at Stanground and March comprise chalk-rich diamictons overlying deltaic deposits that infill depressions cut into the Jurassic bedrock. Both a fluvial and a glacial origin have been argued for the creation of the accommodation space occupied by the deltaic sediments. Although the deltaic sediments do not resolve the argument over the origin of the accommodation space, they do allow speculation that the sub-aqueous depositional environment required for deltaic sedimentation was formed by impoundment at The Wash of a pre-Anglian Fen Basin drainage-network. The evidence from Stanground, particularly, does not support sub-glacial creation of the accommodation space by ice moving from the north to east quadrant. These deposits demonstrate beyond doubt that low-lying areas existed (>18 m below present sea-level at March) in the area of the Fen Basin before the first-known major influx of Cretaceous material from the northeast.

AB Rewetting by beaver is reported from many European peatlands and especially from Belarus, which harbours vast abandoned peat extraction sites and a large beaver population. We studied how vegetation and exchange rates of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) changed after beaver had rewetted an abandoned drained fen in Belarus. We selected three sites with different vegetation and water levels. One meadow site turned into a nutrient-poor lake that remained virtually free of living vascular plants, released CO2 and CH4, and was a moderate source of greenhouse gases (GHG). In another meadow site that became shallowly flooded, the died-off vegetation was quickly replaced by mire plant species and in the second year the site had already become a strong CO2 sink, a moderate CH4 source and, as a result, a strong carbon sink and a weak net GHG emitter. The third site was dominated by forbs that died after intermittent flooding and were only slowly and sparsely replaced by wetland species. This site was a strong source of CO2 and N2O. Beaver activity can restore a peatland's carbon sink and reduce GHG emissions. However, as for humaninduced rewetting, the outcome depends on starting conditions, position and constancy of the water level, and the time needed for establishment of peat forming vegetation.

DE Crop choice; Multi-adaptive model; Paludiculture; Peatlands management

AB The conventional cultivation of drained peatland causes peat oxidation, soil subsidence, nutrient loss, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity reduction. Paludiculture has been identified as an alternative management strategy consisting in the cultivation of biomass on wet and rewetted peatlands. This strategy can save these habitats and restore the ecosystem services provided by the peatlands both on the local and global scale. This paper illustrates the most important features to optimise the crop choice phase which is the crucial point for the success of paludiculture systems. A multi-adaptive framework was proposed. It was based on four points that should be checked to identify suitable crops for paludicultural cropping system: biological traits, biomass production, attitude to cultivation and biomass quality. The main agronomic implications were explored with the help of some results from a plurennial open-field experimentation carried out in a paludicultural system set up in the Massaciuccoli Lake Basin (Tuscany, Italy) and a complete example of the method application was provided. The tested crops were Arundo donax L., Miscanthus(x)giganteus Greef et Deuter, Phragmites australis L., Populus(x)canadensis Moench. and Salix alba L. The results showed a different level of suitability ascribable to the different plant species proving that the proposed framework can discriminate the behaviour of tested crops. Phragmites australis L. was the most suitable crop whereas Populusxcanadensis Moench and Miscanthusxgiganteus Greef et Deuter (in the case of biogas conversion) occupied the last positions in the ranking.

   TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; CONSUMPTION; PHRAGMITES; OXIDATION
AB Drainage of peatlands for agriculture causes an increase of CO2 flux from peat decomposition, contributing to national CO2 emission. The reverse process, i.e. for re-creation of wetlands, reduces the CO2 flux, but increases the CH4 flux. We developed a process model (PEATLAND) to simulate these fluxes from peat soils subject to different water-table management scenarios. The model combines primary production, aerobic decomposition of soil organic matter (including the soil-parent material, peat), CH4 formation, oxidation, and transport. Model input requires specification of water table and air temperature data sets, vegetation parameters such as primary production and parameters related to gas transport, and basic soil physical data. Validation using closed flux-chamber measurements Of CO2 and CH4 from five different sites in the western Netherlands shows that seasonal changes in fluxes Of CO2 and CH4 are correctly modelled. However, the CO2 submodel underestimates peat decomposition when peat decomposition rates obtained from laboratory incubation experiments are used as input. Field decomposition rates are considerably higher. This is attributed to enhancement of decomposition by the addition of easily decomposable material from root exudation ('priming effect'). Model experiments indicate that 1) drainage increases the CO2 production from peat decomposition strongly; 2) restoring a high water table may decrease the total greenhouse gas flux by a small amount although the CH4 flux increases strongly; 3) a warmer climate may cause higher greenhouse gas fluxes from peat soils resulting in a positive feedback to climate warming, and 4) high vegetation productivity in fen meadows may stimulate peat decomposition by the priming effect.

AB The soil water regime was monitored at a forested experimental site in Cumbria, UK. Over an 83-week period following the clearfelling of 35-year-old Sitka spruce, soil water level measurements were related to total weekly rainfall in drainage treatment plots (10, 20 and 40 m ditch spacing) in three replicate blocks. Analysis showed a blockXtreatment interaction which might be related to soil differences between blocks. Significantly deeper soil water levels were measured in the most intensively drained plots of the two gently sloping blocks on a peaty gley soil. Drainage intensity had no effect on soil water level in the third block situated on a surface-water gley soil on a steep slope.

AB This article looks at the imaginaries of progress through technology and new activities by tracing the emergence of Baltic Moorkultur in Estonia and Livonia from the 1850s to the early 1910s. Baltic Moorkultur, a set of modern drainage and peat extraction techniques, has been viewed as part of a modernisation process and evolving visions of future, which touched the identity of Baltic German landowners, scientists and entrepreneurs. General reasons for an impetus for the large-scale reclamation of peatlands were the growth of population, economic liberalisation, growing demand for fuels and the fact that the basis of manorial economy gradually crumbled and led to increasing urge to modernise its source of livelihood. Baltic Moorkultur can be thought as a high-tech response of that time to the exploitation of peatlands. This article explains why it became adopted and how it altered the appraisal of environments that had been perceived as suboptimal.

AB Climate change scenarios suggest that northern peatlands could become drier. To address the type and magnitude of vegetation change associated with persistent drying, we studied changes in biomass and leaf area index following drainage 85 years previously of a bog, using destructive sampling, allometric relationships, and optical measurements. Our results show a 10-fold increase in aboveground biomass between the reference site and the most severely drained site, resulting from the growth of a tree layer. The total leaf biomass increased slightly as a result of drainage, thus an increase in woody biomass was the main cause of the increase in aboveground biomass. Leaf area index approximately tripled in sites where trees grew. Sphagnum L. moss biomass decreased from 120 g.m(-2) at the reference site (20% of all aboveground biomass) to 8 g.m(-2) under the tree canopy (<1% of all aboveground biomass). The percentage of deciduous shrubs increased from 3% of the total shrub biomass in the reference site to 72% in the most severely drained site. Our results show that lowering the water table of a bog can have a profound effect on vegetation but the net effect of these changes on the role of the peatland as a carbon sink remains difficult to assess.

AB The paper presents the results of the research on biogenic sediments from the Jalewka profile (Podlasie region, NE Poland) situated at the foot of a dry valley slope. A 35 cm monolith of sediments was collected from the excavation pit. The sediments were deposited beneath 4 m thick mineral sediments. Interdisciplinary research helped to reconstruct the possible transformations of the local environment. Palynological, physical, and geochemical analyses were applied to organic sediments, and plant macroremains were examined. Five local pollen zones were identified in palynological terms and correlated with the late Warta Stadial (MIS 6) of the Odra Glaciation (Saalian), and four older periods of the Eemian Interglacial: MIS 5e (E1, E2, E3 and E4). Younger zones have not been preserved. They were eroded in the early Vistulian. During the late MIS 6, there was a eutrophic water body with highly transparent water, characterized by a relative stable water level. The landscape was dominated by tundra with a high proportion of Juniperuse-Artemisia. Curves of oxygen (delta O-18) and carbon (delta C-13) stable isotopes confirmed the boundary between MIS 6 and MIS 5e. The beginning of the interglacial vegetation succession (E1) was characterized by expansion of birch-pine-spruce forests. Probably at the end of this period, the lake became shallower. E2 is distinguished by the dominance of pine and birch. The lake was replaced by a peat bog. The sequence of vegetation succession in the landscape was as follows: Quercus (E3), Corylus, Fraxinus-Alnus and Tilia (E4). Probably, the peat bog drained in the E4 and the water level rose again in the climate optimum of the Eemian Interglacial. The results of physical and geochemical analysis clearly corresponded with climatic changes determined by palynological analysis. They provided evidence of the changing redox conditions, variability and intensity of denudation, the scale of biological productivity, and fertility of the environment. The studied sediments were characterized by reducing conditions. The increase in terrigenous silica content and the relatively high N:K ratio indicated the predominance of mechanical denudation during the late glacial period of the Warta Stadial and the E2 period.

AB The post-drainage changes in vegetation composition and carbon balance were studied on four site types (from minero- to ombrotrophic conditions) in Lakkasuo mire, central Finland, by directly comparing undrained and drained parts (30 years ago) of the mire. Drainage had drastically changed the species composition of the sites, especially at the minerotrophic sites, where almost all Sphagna had been replaced by forest mosses. On the ombrotrophic sites much of the mire vegetation still remained 30 years after drainage. Drainage had decreased the C stores in ground vegetation on the minerotrophic sites but increased them on the ombrotrophic sites. The changes were, however, very small compared to the changes in the tree stand, where the C stores had increased at all sites (increasing with nutrient level). The change in peat C balance over the 30-year post-drainage period was negative on the most nutrient-rich site, and positive on the others, increasing with lower nutrient levels. The decrease in the peat C balance on the most nutrient-rich site was compensated by the greater increase in the tree stand C stores and the changes in the total C balance (peat+tree stand+ground vegetation) remained positive on all sites.

AB We studied the effect of soil temperature on nutrient allocation and mycorrhizal development in seedlings of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) during the first 9 weeks of the growing season. One-year-old seedlings were grown in Carex-peat from a drained and forested peatland at soil temperatures of 5, 9, 13 and 17 degreesC under controlled environmental conditions. Fourteen seedlings from each temperature treatment were harvested at intervals of three weeks and the current and previous year's parts of the roots, stems and needles were separated. Mineral nutrient and Al contents in all plant parts were determined and the tips and mycorrhizas of the new roots were counted. Microbial biomass C and N in the growth medium were determined at the end of the experiment. None of the elements studied, except Fe, were taken up from the soil by the seedlings during the first three weeks. Thereafter, the contents of all the elements increased at all soil temperatures except 5 degreesC. Element concentrations in needles, stems and roots increased with soil temperature. Higher soil temperature greatly increased the number of root tips and mycorrhizas, and the numbers of mycorrhizas increased more than did the length of new roots. Cenococcum geophilum was relatively more abundant at lower soil temperatures (5 and 9 degreesC) than at higher ones (13 and 17 degreesC). A trend was observed for decreased microbial biomass C and N in the peat soil at higher soil temperatures at the end of the experiment.

AB Aquatic systems draining peatland catchments receive a high loading of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the surrounding terrestrial environment. Whilst photoprocessing is known to be an important process in the transformation of aquatic DOC, the drivers of temporal variability in this pathway are less well understood. In this study, 8h laboratory irradiation experiments were conducted on water samples collected from two contrasting peatland aquatic systems in Scotland: a peatland stream and a reservoir in a catchment with high percentage peat cover. Samples were collected monthly at both sites from May 2014 to May 2015 and from the stream system during two rainfall events. DOC concentrations, absorbance properties and fluorescence characteristics were measured to investigate characteristics of the photochemically labile fraction of DOC. CO2 and CO produced by irradiation were also measured to determine gaseous photoproduction and intrinsic sample photoreactivity. Significant variation was seen in the photoreactivity of DOC between the two systems, with total irradiation-induced changes typically 2 orders of magnitude greater at the highDOC stream site. This is attributed to longer water residence times in the reservoir rendering a higher proportion of the DOC recalcitrant to photo-processing. During the experimental irradiation, 7% of DOC in the stream water samples was photochemically reactive and direct conversion to CO2 accounted for 46% of the measured DOC loss. Rainfall events were identified as important in replenishing photoreactive material in the stream, with lignin phenol data indicating mobilisation of fresh DOC derived from woody vegetation in the upper catchment. This study shows that peatland catchments produce significant volumes of aromatic DOC and that photoreactivity of this DOC is greatest in headwater streams; however, an improved understanding of water residence times and DOC input-output along the source to sea aquatic pathway is required to determine the fate of peatland carbon.

AB Peatlands store similar to 20 %-30% of the global soil organic carbon stock and are an important source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for inland waters. Recent improvements for in situ optical monitoring revealed that the DOC concentration in streams draining peatlands is highly variable, showing seasonal variation and short and intense DOC concentration peaks. This study aimed to statistically determine the variables driving stream DOC concentration variations at seasonal and event scales. Two mountainous peatlands (one fen and one bog) were monitored in the French Pyrenees to capture their outlet DOC concentration variability at a high-frequency rate (30 min). Abiotic variables including precipitation, stream temperature and water level, water table depth, and peat water temperature were also monitored at high frequency and used as potential predictors to explain DOC concentration variability. Results show that at both sites DOC concentration time series can be decomposed into a seasonal baseline interrupted by many short and intense peaks of higher concentrations. The DOC concentration baseline is driven, at the seasonal scale, by peat water temperature. At the event scale, DOC concentration increases are mostly driven by a rise in the water table within the peat at both sites. Univariate linear models between DOC concentration and peat water temperature or water table increases show greater efficiency at the fen site. Water recession times were derived from water level time series using master recession curve coefficients. They vary greatly between the two sites but also within one peatland site. They partly explain the differences between DOC dynamics in the studied peatlands, including peat porewater DOC concentrations and the links between stream DOC concentration and water table rise within the peatlands. This highlights that peatland complexes are composed of a mosaic of heterogeneous peat units distinctively producing or transferring DOC to streams.

TI Recovery of fen peatland microbiomes and predicted functional profiles

AB Many of the world's peatlands have been affected by water table drawdown and subsequent loss of organic matter. Rewetting has been proposed as a measure to restore peatland functioning and to halt carbon loss, but its effectiveness is subject to debate. An important prerequisite for peatland recovery is a return of typical microbial communities, which drive key processes. To evaluate the effect of rewetting, we investigated 13 fen peatland areas across a wide (>1500 km) longitudinal gradient in Europe, in which we compared microbial communities between drained, undrained, and rewetted sites. There was a clear difference in microbial communities between drained and undrained fens, regardless of location. Community recovery upon rewetting was substantial in the majority of sites, and predictive functional profiling suggested a concomitant recovery of biogeochemical peatland functioning. However, communities in rewetted sites were only similar to those of undrained sites when soil organic matter quality (as expressed by cellulose fractions) and quantity were still sufficiently high. We estimate that a minimum organic matter content of ca. 70% is required to enable microbial recovery. We conclude that peatland recovery after rewetting is conditional on the level of drainage-induced degradation: severely altered physicochemical peat properties may preclude complete recovery for decades.

AB Drainage-induced diffuse pollution and erosion are key water quality problems in peatland forestry. A major part of the pollutant load is transported during peak runoff periods after snowmelt or intense rainfall. This study investigated possibilities to increase retention time of runoff waters in drained peatland catchments on purpose to diminish peak runoff and improve settling conditions of suspended solids (SS). To create retention, a peak runoff control (PRC) structure was developed and its functioning, dimensioning and practical applications were studied in five partly or completely ditch-drained catchments in Central Finland. The method reduced runoff peaks by 10-73% or 5.07-57.631(-1) s(-1) km(-2), and functioned especially well during largest runoff peaks. The effectiveness of the PRC method depended on (i) catchment topography (slope) and available detention volume, (ii) dimensioning and location of the PRC structure, and (iii) runoff rates. The PRC structure is cheap and can easily be created with forest drainage machinery during the ditching and ditch network maintenance operations. Different issues relating to the structural design, water quality benefits, and impacts on forestry are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spring snowmelt in the arctic and boreal regions represents the most significant event in the hydrological year. We measured concentrations and fluxes of different carbon species in 2 small contrasting (control v drained) forested peatland catchments in E. Finland between April and June 2008 and compared these to long-term annual fluxes. Measurements were made using a combination of continuous sensors (CO2, temperature, pH, discharge) and routine spot sampling (DOC, POC, DIC, CO2, CH4, N2O). The highest concentrations of CO2 and CH4 in streamwater were observed under low flow conditions before the spring flood event, reflecting accumulation and downstream release of gaseous C at the end of the winter period. Over the length of the study mean CH4 concentrations were 10x higher in the drained site. The snowmelt event was associated with a dilution of DOC and CO2, with the drained catchment showing a much flashier hydrological response compared to the control site, and post-event, a slower recovery in DOC and CO2 concentrations. Fluxes of all carbon species during the snowmelt event were significant and represented 37-45% of the annual flux. This highlights the challenge of quantifying aquatic C fluxes in areas with large temporal variability and suggests that inability to "capture" the spring snowmelt event may lead to under-estimation of C fluxes in northern regions.

AB Peatlands are valuable but fragile ecosystems with diverse biogeochemical and hydrological functions, so their characterization requires non-destructive investigation. We studied adjacent alpine peatlands of similar size, at the same altitude, and exposed to identical climatic conditions, but with differing topographic and geologic settings producing contrasting ecohydrological functioning; one is a rainwater-fed bog, the other is a groundwater-fed fen. Two intentionally simple geoelectrical techniques were applied to obtain rapid geophysical fingerprints of these peatlands: vertical electrical sounding (VES) and self-potential (SP). Strongly contrasting results agree with conceptual understandings of bogs and fens. The bog VES displays a high-resistivity near-surface layer, corresponding to lowly-mineralized rainwater, while resistivity in the fen is two orders of magnitude lower due to more highly-mineralized groundwater. The SP profile of the bog indicates radially-divergent drainage, while the profile of the fen points to lateral groundwater inflow from adjacent slopes. The paired-peatland approach made possible identification and isolation of the effects of hydrological functioning on geophysical properties, while eliminating possible differences due to climate or altitude. Most importantly, this study shows that very few and simple geophysical measurements can produce critical near-real-time data on hydrologic properties of peatlands - which is especially important for inaccessible high alpine locations.

AB I conducted anuran vocalization surveys in cranberry bogs, drainage ditches, and reservoirs of three active and three abandoned cranberry farms in the New Jersey Pinelands to examine the distribution of four anuran species in three consecutive years. I then applied a multinomial model to quantify their calling intensity and assess the influence of cranberry cultivation activities on each anuran species. I discovered that four species naturally inhabiting the Pinelands exhibited varied responses to cranberry cultivation. The responses ranged from positive to negative depending on the life history characteristics, disturbance tolerance, and especially the breeding season of the species in question. Green frogs (Lithobates (=Rana) clamitans) showed a high abundance in the bog habitats of active farms, where they exhibited prolonged courtship calls in late summer. Fowler's Toads (Anaxyrus (=Bufo) fowleri) exhibited high abundance in the ditches of active farms and the reservoirs of abandoned farms. On the other hand, Southern Leopard Frogs (Lithobates sphenocephalus) and Carpenter Frogs (Lithobates virgatipes) showed a reduced occurrence and calling intensity in active farms, probably because of the intensive water management that coincides with their breeding or wintering season, respectively. My findings indicate that wetlands in agricultural settings with diverse habitats can potentially be used as breeding habitats by anurans, but only if agricultural activities do not interfere with the anuran's breeding and wintering patterns.

AB Changes in winter time conditions at high-latitude ecosystems could severely affect the carbon exchange processes. Using a 15year stream record combined with winter field measurements and laboratory experiment, we studied the regulation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in stream water draining boreal mire during snow melt. The most unanticipated finding was that cold soils with deep soil frost resulted in increased snow melt DOC concentrations in the stream runoff. Wintertime field measurements of DOC concentrations below the mire soil frost showed that this phenomenon could be explained by freeze-out of DOC giving higher levels of DOC in the soil water below the ice as the soil frost developed downwards in the mire. Experimental freezing of water with a certain DOC concentration in the laboratory further corroborated the freeze-out of DOC. In this experiment, as much as 96% of the DOC was excluded from the ice, whereas the freeze-out in the mire was less effective (60%). The difference between the proportion of DOC retained in pure water relative to the proportion retained in peat water during freezing is probably due to trapped DOC in the solid peat soil matrix. A simple mass-balance model showed that to explain the higher stream DOC concentrations during a winter with deep soil frost, approximately 0.5% of the mire area needed to be hydrologically connected to the stream discharge. In the stream records, we also found that the DOC concentrations during snow melt episodic runoff were negatively related to increasing intensity of the snow melt episodes (dilution by low DOC snow melt water) and higher previous export of DOC.

AB It is generally known that managed, drained peatlands act as carbon (C) sources. In this study we examined how mitigation through the reduction of the intensity of land management and through rewetting may affect the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and the C balance of intensively managed, drained, agricultural peatlands. Carbon and GHG balances were determined for three peatlands in the western part of the Netherlands from 2005 to 2008 by considering spatial and temporal variability of emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O). One area (Oukoop) is an intensively managed grass-on-peatland area, including a dairy farm, with the ground water level at an average annual depth of 0.55 (+/- 0.37) m below the soil surface. The second area (Stein) is an extensively managed grass-on-peatland area, formerly intensively managed, with a dynamic ground water level at an average annual depth of 0.45 (+/- 0.35) m below the soil surface. The third area is a (since 1998) rewetted former agricultural peatland (Horstermeer), close to Oukoop and Stein, with the average annual ground water level at a depth of 0.2 (+/- 0.20) m below the soil surface. During the measurement campaigns we found that both agriculturally managed sites acted as C and GHG sources and the rewetted former agricultural peatland acted as a C and GHG sink. The ecosystem (fields and ditches) total GHG balance, including CO2, CH4 and N2O, amounted to 3.9 (+/- 0.4), 1.3 (+/- 0.5) and -1.7 (+/- 1.8) g CO2-eq m(-2) d(-1) for Oukoop, Stein and Horstermeer, respectively. Adding the farm-based emissions to Oukoop and Stein resulted in a total GHG emission of 8.3 (+/- 1.0) and 6.6 (+/- 1.3) gCO(2)-eq m(-2) d(-1), respectively. For Horstermeer the GHG balance remained the same since no farm-based emissions exist. Considering the C balance (uncertainty range 40-60 %), the total C release in Oukoop and Stein is 5270 and 6258 kg Cha(-1) yr(-1), respectively (including ecosystem and management fluxes), and the total C uptake in Horstermeer is 3538 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Water bodies contributed significantly to the terrestrial GHG balance because of a high release of CH4.
   Overall, this study suggests that managed peatlands are large sources of GHGs and C, but, if appropriate measures are taken, they can be turned back into GHG and C sinks within 15 years of abandonment and rewetting. The shift from an intensively managed grass-on-peat area (Oukoop) to an extensively managed one (Stein) reduced the GHG emissions mainly because N2O emission and farm-based CH4 emissions decreased.

AB A floristic-ecological study of desmids from side- and dead-arms of the Danube river, lakes, canals and peat-ponds, all situated in the southern Hungarian Plain, is presented. A total of 115 desmid taxa belonging to 16 genera were identified. Seventeen taxa are new to the Hungarian desmid flora. Although all water bodies investigated were distinctly alkaline, a number of desmid species, known in the literature as "acidophilous", were encountered (e.g. Penium, margaritaceum, Closterium gracile, Micrasterias pinnatifida, Staurastrum, hystrix). Noticeable was also the occurrence of a fair number of species at high conductivity values (1000-2000 muS cm(-1)) in natron lakes, e.g. Actinotaenium diplosporum, Closterium dianae, Euastrum insulare var. lacustre, Cosmarium botrytis, C. impressulum, C. punctulatum, Staurastrum crenulatum, S. punctulatum.

AB Restoring degraded peat soils presents an attractive, but largely untested, climate change mitigation approach. Drained peat soils used for agriculture can be large greenhouse gas sources. By restoring subsided peat soils to managed, impounded wetlands, significant agricultural emissions are avoided, and soil carbon can be sequestered and protected. Here, we synthesize 36 site-years of continuous carbon dioxide and methane flux data from a mesonetwork of eddy covariance towers in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California, USA to compute carbon and greenhouse gas budgets for drained agricultural land uses and compare these to restored deltaic wetlands. We found that restored wetlands effectively sequestered carbon and halted soil carbon loss associated with drained agricultural land uses. Depending on the age and disturbance regime of the restored wetland, many land use conversions from agriculture to restored wetland resulted in emission reductions over a 100-year timescale. With a simple model of radiative forcing and atmospheric lifetimes, we showed that restored wetlands do not begin to accrue greenhouse gas benefits until nearly a half century, and become net sinks from the atmosphere after a century. Due to substantial interannual variability and uncertainty about the multi-decadal successional trajectory of managed, restored wetlands, ongoing ecosystem flux measurements are critical for understanding the long-term impacts of wetland restoration for climate change mitigation.

AB Groundwater discharge from an esker aquifer to a fen was studied to understand relevant hydrological processes for groundwater-surface water interaction in an esker-peatland hillslope. Piezometric levels of the peat layer and esker sand layer were continuously monitored and compared to climate data. Groundwater exfiltration points were spatially mapped and related to peat depth. The study showed a clear interaction between fen surface water and sand esker groundwater although the hydraulic conductivity of peat was low and the peat depth thick. In the artesian aquifer beneath the fen, the piezometric head showed a clear response to precipitation and evapotranspiration. Wetting of the peat is rapidly seen as pressure increase in the confined aquifer. This provides new information on hydraulics of wetlands found in aquifer discharge areas. Groundwater exfiltrated through thick peat layers in vertical preferential point discharges demonstrating how double porosity provides flow through the peat layer with low hydraulic conductivity in the peat matrix. The "pipe flow" channels were found in the deep peat area in the transition zones from deep peat to shallow peat. Diffuse seepage through the ditch bottom was found where ditches cut into the sand layer. Increased discharge through the ditch bed reduced the flow resistance at the aquifer boundary which can lower the groundwater level in the esker. The results show new processes in the groundwater discharge zone that are useful for groundwater modelling and policy development for future groundwater protection. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB A before-after-control approach was used to analyze the impact of peatland restoration on hydrology, based on high temporal resolution water-table (WT) data from 43 boreal peatlands representative of a south-boreal to north-boreal climate gradient. During the study, 24 forestry drained sites were restored and 19 pristine peatlands used as control sites. Different approaches were developed and used to analyze WT changes (mean WT position, WT fluctuation, WT hydrograph, recession, and storage characteristics). Restoration increased WT in most cases but particularly in spruce mires, followed by pine mires and fens. Before restoration, the WT fluctuation (WTF) was large, indicating peat temporary storage gain (SG). After restoration, the WT hydrograph recession limb slopes and SG coefficients (Rc) declined significantly. Drainage or restoration did not significantly affect mean diurnal WT fluctuations, used here as a proxy for evapotranspiration. Overall, the changes in WT characteristics following restoration indicated creation of favorable hydrological conditions for recovery of functional peatland ecosystems in previously degraded peatland sites. This was supported by calculation of bryophyte species abundance thresholds for WT. These results can be used to optimize restoration efforts in different peatland systems and as a qualitative conceptual basis for future restoration operations.

AB Various peatland restoration strategies developed during the last two decades have aimed to stop degradation and bring back the original hydrology, biodiversity and other peatland functions. This study evaluated progress 6-15 years after rewetting in vegetation development, physicochemical properties of peat, soil organic matter (SOM) quality and microbial activity in previously long-term drained bogs and spruce swamp forests (SSF) in comparison with pristine and long-term drained sites in the Bohemian Forest, Czech Republic.
   Long-term drainage led to overall ecosystem degradation, indicated by a change in vegetation composition, reduced decomposability of peat, with high content of recalcitrant compounds and decreased pH, and reduced soil microbial biomass and activity. The degradation was more pronounced in SSF, while bogs seemed to be relatively resistant to environmental changes caused by drainage. Post-rewetting progress has occurred with regard to vegetation composition, peat pH, microbial biomass and potential anaerobic CO2 and CH4 production, all of which tending towards characteristics of the pristine sites. However, overall SOM quality has not yet responded significantly, indicating that some peat properties and functions, such as C accumulation, need much longer periods of time to return to the original level.

AB Background and Aims Forest peatlands represent 25 % of global peatlands and store large amounts of carbon (C) as peat. Traditionally they have been drained in order to increase forestry yield, which may cause large losses of C from the peat. Rewetting aims to stop these losses and to restore the initial storage function of the peatlands. As roots represent major peat-forming elements in these systems, we sampled roots with diameter <5 mm in a drained and a rewetted forest peatland in north-east Germany to evaluate differences in tree biomass investments below ground, root functional characteristics and root age.
   Methods We cored soil next to Alnus glutinosa stems and sorted root biomass into <1, 1-2 and 2-5 mm diameter classes. We measured biomass distribution and specific root area (SRA) in 10-cm depth increments down to 50 cm, and estimated root age from annual growth rings.
   Key Results Root biomass in the rewetted site was more than double that in the drained site. This difference was mostly driven by very fine roots <1 mm, which accounted for 51 % of the total root biomass and were mostly (75 %) located in the upper 20 cm. For roots <1 mm, SRA did not differ between the sites. However, SRA of the 1-2 mm and 2-5 mm diameter roots was higher in the drained than in the rewetted site. Root age did not differ between sites.
   Conclusions The size-dependent opposite patterns between root biomass and their functional characteristics under contrasting water regimes indicate differences between fine and coarse roots in their response to environmental changes. Root age distribution points to similar root turnover rates between the sites, while higher root biomass in the rewetted site clearly indicates larger tree C stocks below ground under rewetting, supporting the C sink function of the ecosystem.

AB Size structural dynamics of naturally established Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands growing on peatlands drained for forestry were investigated. The study was based on modelling of diameter at breast height (DBH) distributions of repeatedly measured stands in southern Finland. The Weibull function was used to parameterize the DBH distributions and mixed linear models were constructed to characterize the impacts of different ecological factors on stand dynamics. Initially, the positive skewness of the DBH distributions increased after drainage as a result of increases in stem numbers and a reduction in mean diameters. Simultaneously, the size inequality among trees increased. These changes were due to regeneration and (or) ingrowth and indicated only little competition from the larger trees. Subsequently, the DBH distributions changed from positively skewed to normal and finally to negatively skewed resulting from tree growth and a reduction in the number of small DBH trees. This indicated increased asymmetric intertree competition. Size inequality did not change during this later stage in stand development, suggesting a concurrent component of symmetric competition. Thinnings had little impact on DBH distribution trends. The observed stand dynamics allow the allocation of growth resources to the desired crop component by appropriate silvicultural treatments.

AB Urban environment exerts an ambiguous effect on the organic pool of soils; it may decrease (as compared to the background values) in some parts of a city and increase in other parts. The organic matter accumulation in urban soils is promoted by the input of aerial organic pollutants; slowed down mineralization of plant residues under the influence of contamination; and increased productivity of the plants owing to elevated temperatures, high content of carbon dioxide in the air, and maintenance of green zones (sodding of vast areas in cities, application of peat, irrigation and drainage of soils.).

AB Fens occur in many Colorado Rocky Mountain watersheds that have historically been affected by metal mining activities. A persistent effect of mining is acid rack drainage (ARD), which flows from mine adits and tailings piles. ARD water has low pH and high concentrations of heavy metals and can pollute surface and ground waters supporting fens. There are few floristic differences between polluted and pristine fens, and it is unclear what long-term affects ARD has on fens. We investigated decomposition of native leaf litter and a standard litter for two years in four Carer aquatilis-dominated subalpine fens. Two of the fens are affected by ARD, and their source waters have pH < 4.0 and high concentrations of dissolved Zn, Cu, Mn, and Pb. The other two fens are relatively pristine, with source water pH > 6.0 and low metal concentrations. ARD significantly reduced native litter decomposition rates over two years (ANOVA, p < 0.01), with 63% of the initial mass of leaf litter remaining at the most polluted site (Peru Creek fen), 47% at a moderately polluted site (Argentine fen), and 23% at the most pristine site (Deer Creek fen). ARD also reduced the quality of litter produced. Standard litter decomposed more rapidly than native litter at all sites, particularly Peru Creek fen. Site, representing fen environment, and litter origin, representing native vs, standard litter, significantly affected decomposition rates (ANOVA, p < 0.0001). Pristine fens had decomposition rates comparable with boreal rich fens, while polluted fens had decomposition rates comparable with boreal poor fens and bogs. Acid rock drainage causes ecosystem-level responses in organic matter processing, peat accumulation rates, and most likely in nutrient cycling, which could have long-term affects on fen primary and secondary production and other functions.

AB Greenhouse gas fluxes (CH4, N2O and CO2) at a managed Finnish peat soil site were compared with those in a virgin fen in 1991 and 1992. The field site was drained about 60 years ago, and as it was used for pasturing and fodder production, the CH4 released by the cattle was estimated on the basis of data in the literature. The annual budgets of the gases were estimated and their GWP values calculated to assess the climatic impact of the current agricultural activity. Methane emission from the field site, 1 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1) was low, compared with that from the natural fen site, 260 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1). Annual N2O emission at the field site was 8 and 9 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Summer N2O emission in 1992 from vegetationless soil was five times higher than that from actual grassland. The N2O emissions from the natural fen site were low, close to the detection limit. The GWP for the field CH4 release (including cattle) corresponded to 0.3 X 10(4) kg CO2 ha(-1). The GWP for the annual N2O production was 0.2-0.4 x 10(4) kg CO2 ha(-1), while the grassland soil released 2.2 x 10(4) kg CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1). In its virgin state the field site may have accumulated 600 kg CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1). Although there must be a compensating carbon input into the soil in the form of root litter and exudates, a considerable carbon loss occurred (1.5 x 10(4) kg ha(-1) yr(-1)). The total GWP associated with cultivation was estimated to be 2.6 x 10(4) kg CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1).

AB The paper focuses on the role of ants as soil engineers in three drained fens. Physical, chemical and biotic soil conditions and effects. of ants on soil conditions were compared between fens differing in peat origin. Multivariate statistical methods were applied (PCA, RDA).
   Relationships between soil moisture, indices of the amount of nutrients soil biological activity, and released were better expressed in the anthill soil than in the adjacent soil. A lower bulk density of the anthill soil, thus, a higher soil porosity, enhanced the leaching of water- extractable, mobile metallic cations and nitric ions. The composition of humus fraction was strongly dependent on soil chemical properties. In both the anthill soil and the adjacent soil, the content of humic acids was positively related with bulk density, whereas the content of humins was related with moisture. In adjacent soil, cation exchange capacity (CEC) was positively related with the content of humic acids and with bulk density. This relationship was not so clear in the anthill soil.
   The direction of changes in these relationships in the anthill soil was influenced by ant societies. The number of individuals in society determined the nest structure and the associated increase in soil humidity and porosity. The consumption by ants, thus the input of matter rich in nitrogen, influenced the functional, structure of microorganisms and their activity.

TI DEHYDRATION AND THE THREAT TO EAST ANGLIAN FENS, ENGLAND
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SPECIES RICHNESS; VEGETATION
AB The vegetation communities of East Anglian valley head fens are dependent for their water supply upon calcareous spring water. Many of these fen vegetation types are nationally localised, some are rare and all have considerable conservation importance.
   Many of the fens have been detrimentally influenced by drainage, and increasingly abstraction of water from the aquifer threatens their nature conservation importance directly and by exacerbating the effects of climatic drought. Changes have occurred in the species composition of a significant number of sites and in some instances this has resulted in a change in vegetation community type.
   The effect of drainage upon fens is longstanding and whilst this has undoubtedly caused a decrease in nature conservation interest, the spring-dependent communities have often survived. The threat of groundwater abstraction is comparatively more recent and directly threatens the springs themselves and the nationally important vegetation communities associated with them. With the exception of a few cases where intensive hydrological studies have been undertaken, it is difficult to establish the impact of groundwater abstraction upon fen water table levels. In many cases reference is made to past floristic records and the descriptions of fens to provide evidence of dehydration.
   Engineered measures to ameliorate the impact of water loss are often suggested but are seldom ecologically acceptable. The problem of dehydration due to water abstraction needs to be tackled strategically in the long term, though action needs to be taken over currently existing licences. The alleviation of the problem-will be helped if water resource plans accommodate the water demand of those fens with a high wildlife interest.

AB Methanogens (domain Archaea) have a unique role in the carbon cycle as producers of the greenhouse gas methane (CH(4)). Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is a vital enzyme in CH(4) production, and the mcrA gene coding for a subunit of MCR has been employed as a specific marker for the detection and differentiation of methanogen communities. A critical step in assessing environmental mcrA diversity is the selection of PCR primers. The objective of this study was to compare the diversity coverage of three published mcrA primer sets MCR, ME and ML (also known as MCR and Luton-mcrA) and their ability to discern methanogen communities in a drained peatland. The primers were applied to DNA extracts from unfertilised and ash-fertilised peat from two different depths. Amplified mcrA communities were cloned and sequenced, and the sequences were divided into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequence analysis. All primers recovered characteristic OTUs associated with the peat depths and treatments and confirmed a previous observation of low methanogen diversity. The minor differences in OTU ranges of the primers did not greatly affect the observed community composition. However, as the proportions of several OTUs varied strongly, the primers provided different quantitative representations of mcrA communities. We concluded that the ML and MCR primers had better amplification ranges than the ME set, but the use of MCR with peat samples was problematic due to poor amplification. Consequently, the ML primers were best suited for mcrA analysis of peatland methanogen communities. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Methane (CH4) flux was measured from undrained, drained, and ditched portions of treed fen, forested bog, and treed bog sites in the Wally Creek experimental drainage site (near Cochrane, Ontario), from May to October 1991. Drainage for 7 years lowered the water table from between -21 and -49 cm to -41 and -93 cm at the three respective sites. Drainage resulted in a conversion of the peatlands from a CH4 source (0 to 15 mg CH4 . m(-2). d(-1)) to a small CH4 sink (0 to -0.4 mg CH4 . m(-2). d(-1)). In contrast, CH4 efflux from the ditches ranged from <5 to >400 mg CH4 . m(-2). d(-1). The flux data were used to estimate the impact of forest drainage practices on net CH4 emissions from a forest drainage complex. For the treed and forested bogs, there was a net increase in CH4 emissions where ditch spacing was closer than 38 m. Even with very close ditch spacing (>12 m), there was a net decrease in CH4 flux from the treed fen. The results of this study indicate that the combination of low antecedent CH4 fluxes from an undrained peatland, and moderate fluxes from the drainage ditches, will produce a net increase in CH4 emissions from forest drainage.

AB Soil preparation to expedite stand establishment after clearcutting is an extensively applied measure in peatland forest regeneration sites particularly in Fennoscandinavia. Thus far, the impact of preparing peat soil on greenhouse gas fluxes is a chapter unwritten in GHG research on forestry-drained peatlands. Not only is such information vital in order to accurately estimate the GHG balance nationally, it may dictate the very methods used to regenerate forests on peat soils in the future. Over a 22-month period, we studied the impacts of mounding and scalping relative to the control on soil CO2 (heterotrophic peat soil respiration, SRp), CH4, and N2O fluxes along a moisture gradient in a nutrient-poor, clearcut forestry-drained peatland. First, we measured instantaneous gas fluxes (g m(-2) h(-1)) of the microsite types (unprepared, mound, pit, scalp) within a given treatment plot (control, mounding, scalping) in order to estimate their annual rates (g m(-2) a(-1)). Then, we estimated annual flux rates for each treatment comprehensively by considering the surface area-based distribution of microsite types in the corresponding treatment plot, and finally, the overall climatic impact of GHG emissions expressed in terms of CO2 equivalents (100-year GWP) 2-3 years after clearcutting and soil preparation. Compared to the control microsites, instantaneous CO2 emissions from scalps and pits were lower while those from mounds equivalent. However, increased CO2 emissions from the unprepared microsites within prepared plots were observed in respect to those of the control. Comprehensively, the annual CO2 emission rates differed little between treatments, ranging between 929 and 1078 g m(-2) a(-1). Hence, neither mounding nor scalping accelerated annual SRp relative to the control treatment. Annual fluxes of CH4 were dependent on the position of the water table. In our wet block, the mounding treatment led to the greatest annual CH4 emissions (3.62 g m(-2) a(-1)), followed by the control (2.14 g m(-2) a(-1)) and scalping (1.05 g m(-2) a(-1)); in the dry block, however, only the scalping treatment was a net, though minimal, source of CH4 (0.80 g m(-2) a(-1)) while the other two treatments effectively consumed CH4 (mounding -0.16 g m(-2) a(-1); control -0.05 g m(-2) a(-1)). Though annual N2O emission levels were low (0.05-0.08 g m(-2) a(-1)), both soil preparation treatments increased the flux of N2O from peat soil compared to the control. When considering the fluxes of all three greenhouse gases, the cumulative impact of soil preparation (mounding or scalping) on the global warming potential of the nutrient-poor, clearcut peatland forest was negligible in respect to the control.

AB Drained peatlands are hotspots of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from agricultural soils. As a consequence of both drainage-induced mineralisation and anthropogenic mixing with mineral soils, large areas of former peatlands under agricultural use underwent a secondary transformation of the peat (e.g. formation of aggregates). These soils show contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) at the boundary between mineral and organic soils. However, the carbon (C) dynamics of such soils have rarely been studied so far. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the vulnerability of soil organic matter (SOM) to decomposition over the whole range of peat-derived soils under agriculture including very carbon rich mineral soils (76-526 g kg(-1) SOC). A total of 62 soil samples covering a broad range of soil and site characteristics were selected from the sample set of the German Agricultural Soil Inventory. Potential CO2 production was measured by aerobic incubation. Fen and bog peat samples were grouped into disturbance classes according to their soil properties. Specific basal respiration rates (SBR), i.e. CO2 fluxes per unit SOC, showed the highest values for the most disturbed samples for both fen peat (13.9 +/- 6.0 mu g CO2-C g SOC-1 h(-1)) and bog peat (10.9 +/- 4.7 mu g CO2-C g SOC-1 h(-1)). Respiration rates of bog peat increased more strongly with an increasing degree of disturbance than those of fen peat. Perhaps counterintuitively, SOM vulnerability to decomposition thus increased with an increasing degree of disturbance and a decreasing SOC content, indicating positive feedback mechanisms as soon as peat soils are disturbed by drainage. Furthermore, the variability of the SBR increased drastically with increasing degree of disturbance. The turnover of SOM in less disturbed peat samples tended to be higher in samples with higher nitrogen (N) content, higher pH value and lower C:N ratio, while plant-available phosphorus was important for the mineralisation of more severely disturbed peat. However, clear correlations between a single soil property and SBR could not be identified. The high potential of CO2 emissions from organic soils with a low SOC content implies that mixing organic soil with mineral soil does not seem to be a promising option for mitigating greenhouse emissions.

AB The geographical distribution of mires in the oceanic mountain ranges of western Europe cannot be explained without bringing together a number of physical and human factors. In Les Monts du Forez, which are granitic and metamorphic mountains covering an area of 1800 km(2) and rising to an altitude of 1634 m in the east of the French Massif Central, a series of mires on long slopes reflects the effects of changing combinations of these factors with altitude. The scale of variation falls within the limits of bioclimatic levels and is manifest as: the absence of mires at foothill levels below 900 m; small mires of anthropogenic origin and remnant peat at lower mountain levels between 900 m and 1100 m; peat systems where evolution has been more or less affected by human intervention at median mountain levels between 1100 m and 1250 m; large ombrotrophic mires, often naturally convex and dating from the first half of the Holocene epoch, at upper mountain levels between 1250 m and 1450 m; and small established mires that are more or less directly linked to human intervention at sub-alpine levels above 1450 m. The role of human societies appears to dominate, with exceptions in the upper mountain levels. Human influence presents in two forms, both of which are related to the old traditional farming methods of the region: the first is destruction of mires, mostly by drainage, and the second is mire creation through modifications of the hydrology of the valley floor and the vegetation cover. This spatial and multi-factor distribution of mires is a component that should be taken into account in relation to their conservation management.

AB Degradation of ecosystems is a great concern on the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Ecological restoration fights degradation aiming at the recovery of ecosystem functions such as carbon (C) sequestration and ecosystem structures like plant communities responsible for the C sequestration function. We selected 38 pristine, drained and restored boreal peatland sites in Finland and asked i) what is the long-term effect of drainage on the peatland surface layer C storage, ii) can restoration recover ecosystem functioning (surface layer growth) and structure (plant community composition) and iii) is the recovery of the original structure needed for the recovery of ecosystem functions? We found that drainage had resulted in a substantial net loss of C from surface layer of drained sites. Restoration was successful in regaining natural growth rate in the peatland surface layer already within 5 years after restoration. However, the regenerated surface layer sequestered C at a mean rate of 116.3 g m(-2) yr(-1) (SE 12.7), when a comparable short-term rate was 178.2 g m(-2) yr(-1) (SE 13.3) at the pristine sites. The plant community compositions of the restored sites were considerably dissimilar to those of pristine sites still 10 years after restoration. We conclude that ecological restoration can be used to jump-start some key peatland ecosystem functions even without the recovery of original ecosystem structure (plant community composition). However, the re-establishment of other functions like C sequestration may require more profound recovery of conditions and ecosystem structure. We discuss the potential economic value of restored peatland ecosystems from the perspective of their C sequestration function. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Jegrznia floodplain has been deprived of flooding since the late 19th century. Human influence has been limited to haymaking and cattle grazing without land reclamation. Therefore, the present vegetation reflects the impact of hydrological changes, without being much disturbed by changes in other factors. A drainage gradient on the former floodplain was examined for nutrient deficiencies and compared with an intact floodplain. For this purpose we analyzed nutrient concentrations in aboveground biomass, we measured redox potentials and peat variables for a rich fen vegetation, a well-developed fen meadow as well as an impoverished fen meadow vegetation. According to P:N-ratios in above ground biomass, all vegetation types appear to be limited by phosphorus, whereas the impoverished fen meadow is also limited by potassium. These results are supported by the chemical composition of the peat, redox characteristics and the physical changes in the peat induced by drainage. It is concluded that hydrological changes in combination with an annual mowing regime resulted in a shift from no nutrient limitation to P- and/or K-limitation in the former Jegrznia floodplain. Changes in hydrology at Jegrznia stopped the input of nutrients, increased the leaching of K and turned P into unavailable Al and Fe-complexes. Continued mowing increased P- and K-deficiency.

AB Long term research has been conducted into the hydrological effects of different land usage of a wetland mire in southern Germany. Drainage for agriculture lowered the water table and reduced evaporation from about 110% of open water losses to just under the Penman short grass potential rate. The runoff regime was altered and peak flows increased. Afforestation of agricultural land increased evaporation losses to much higher levels than open water evaporation, and annual runoff was nearly halved. Forest growth reduced soil water and baseflows. Peak flows became smaller; the rate of reduction was particularly rapid in the early years of tree growth.

AB Efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are receiving increased attention among governmental and commercial actors. In recent years, the interest in paludiculture, i.e. the use of rewetted peatlands, has grown because of its potential to reduce GHG emissions by stopping soil decomposition. Moreover, cultivating wetland plants on rewetted peatlands for bioenergy production that replaces fossil fuels in the transport sector, can contribute to additional GHG emission reductions. In this study, an analysis of literature data was conducted to obtain data on GHG emissions (CO2 and CH4) and biomass production from rewetted peatlands cultivated with two different wetland plant species: Phragmites australis (Pa) and Typha latifolia (Tl). In addition, a biogas experiment was carried out to investigate the biomethane yield of Pa and Tl biomass, and the reduction of global warming potential (GWP) by using biomethane as vehicle fuel. The results show that peatland rewetting can be an important measure to mitigate the GWP as it reduces GHG emissions from the soil, particularly on a 100-year timescale but also to some extent on a 20-year timescale. More specifically, rewetting of 1 km(2) of peatland can result in a GWP reduction corresponding to the emissions from +/- 2600 average sized petrol cars annually. Growing Pa on rewetted peatlands reduces soil GHG emissions more than growing Tl, but Pa and Tl produced similar amounts of biomass and biomethane per land area. Our study concludes that Pa, because of a more pronounced GWP reduction, is the most suitable wetland plant to cultivate after peatland rewetting.

AB The ongoing pressures of climate change, as expressed by the increased intensity, duration, and frequency of temperature and precipitation events, threatens the storage of carbon in northern latitudes. One key concern is how these events will affect the production, mobilization, and export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the main form of aquatic carbon export in these regions. In this study, we retrospectively show contrasting effects of climate extremes over 23 years on two adjacent boreal catchments, one dominated by forest cover and the other draining a mire (wetland), despite experiencing the same extreme climate events. During the peak snowmelt, DOC concentrations ranged from 20 to 33 mg l(-1) in the forest catchment and 10-28 mg l(-1) in the mire catchment respectively, highlighting large inter-annual variation in the springtime hydrologicCexport at both sites. Weused climate and discharge variables to predict this variation, and found that DOC from the forested catchment, which is derived largely from riparian soils, had the highest concentrations following cold summers, dry autumns, and winters with high precipitation. By contrast, in the mire outlet, where DOC is primarily derived from decomposing peat, the highest DOC concentrations in the spring followed cold/dry winters and dry summers. Our results indicate that processes regulating stream DOC concentrations during spring in both catchments were dependent on both temperature and precipitation in multiple seasons. Together, these patterns suggest that DOC responses to climatic extremes are complex and generate variable patterns in springtime concentrations that are strongly dependent upon landscape context.

TI EFFECT OF DEVELOPMENT AND CULTIVATION ON PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES OF PEAT
   SOILS IN NEW-ZEALAND
SO GEODERMA
LA English
DT Article
ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; MINNESOTA
AB The effect of development and cultivation on the physical properties of two peat soils formed from restiad/sedge and sphagnum peat and developed for agriculture in the Hauraki Plains, New Zealand is reported by comparing physical properties of the plough layer (0-15 cm) and the relatively unaffected underlying peat (15-40 cm). Drainage and cultivation reduced soil moisture content, increased bulk density and reduced organic matter content. Bulk density was correlated with organic matter content only for the plough layer and indicates that bulk density alone is not a good indicator of decomposition in weakly decomposed peat soils in this region. Moisture retention curves indicated that a large amount of the water in the soil could not be removed at high suctions (up to 65% of the water was retained at suctions of 1500 kPa) and may cause moisture stress for plants, particulary in the plough layer of sphagnum peat, despite the high water content of the soil. This has important implications for maintaining a water table which maintains an adequate available water content for plants in the unsaturated zone immediately above the water table.
   Hydraulic conductivity differed between peat types in both the plough layer and the underlying peat. The presence of a root layer at 35-40 cm in the restiad/sedge peat was considered to substantially influence the readings and has important implications for drainage design in the soil.
   A simple method for measuring shrinkage in peat soils which involves coating natural clods in a saran resin is presented. A shrinkage curve indicated that shrinkage in peat is directly related to the gravimetric water content and does not contain zones of residual or structural shrinkage which are often associated with mineral soils. It is suggested, therefore, that a simple linear model based upon normal shrinkage will successfully predict volume changes associated with drainage of peat soils for agriculture.

AB It is currently recommended to use buffer areas in reducing nutrient export from forested areas to water courses. Nutrient retention in buffer areas has been studied mostly by using artificial nutrient additions, hence information is needed from areas where the increased export originates from an actual forestry practice. We investigated the capacity of riparian buffer areas to reduce the ammonium (NH4-N) export originating from ditch network maintenance areas on boreal forested peatlands. Our results indicated that buffers are inefficient for reducing loadings that already are close to background levels of forested areas. In such a case, the buffer may even release NH4-N into through-flow waters. When the loading rate increased high above the background level, efficient reduction in NH4-N transport became possible. Besides the rate of ammonium loading, a factor behind efficient retention was the sufficient length of the buffer, whereas high volume of runoff decreased retention efficiency. Other buffer characteristics, such as the soil properties (bulk density, CEC), the tree stand structure, and the density of surface vegetation, were insignificant for ammonium retention efficiency.

AB As compared with mineral soils, there are few in situ measurements of the unsaturated hydraulic properties of peat soils available. We used parameter estimation (inverse) methods to estimate the water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions of drained peat soils from both laboratory and field data. The laboratory data were obtained on small cores using the traditional evaporation method, while the field data were obtained by means of evaporation experiments using groundwater lysimeters with and without vegetation. The field experiments without vegetation produced highly uncertain parameters and were limited to a relatively small pressure head range. Better results were obtained for the lysimeter with a grass cover that caused the peat soil to dry out more. However, a physically realistic minimum in the objective function for the plant-covered lysimeter could be found only when prior information about several parameters was included in the optimization. Good agreement was obtained between the laboratory and field measurements. The hydraulic functions were subsequently tested by comparing forward simulations with independently measured pressure heads and water contents of an additional lysimeter experiment under grass. The dynamics of the drying process was described well using the optimized soil hydraulic properties.

ID PEATLAND DRAINAGE; CHEMISTRY; PATTERNS; WATER
AB Big Meadows, a 63-ha fen in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP), was ditched for agricultural purposes in the early part of this century. Although use of the ditch ceased after the establishment of Rh PMNP in 1915, it continued to intercept sheet flows in the central and southern portions of the fen, causing the ground-water level to decrease and aerobic soil conditions to develop in the mid- to late-summer of most years. In 1990, the ditch was blocked in an attempt to restore the hydrologic regime in the central and southern portions of the fen. Water-level data from three years prior to restoration and four years after restoration show that blocking the ditch successfully restored surface sheet flow, high late-summer watertable levels, and anaerobic soil conditions in much of the central and southern portions of the fen. Conditions in these areas are now similar to those in the northern portion of the fen. The long-term data from this site also indicate that summer rainfall has a greater influence on the magnitude of late-summer drying than the size of the winter snowpack. In a post-restoration year with extremely low rainfall in July and August, water levels throughout the fen decreased to levels similar to those observed throughout most of the pre-restoration period. The study suggests that this and other fens in the southern Rocky Mountains are extremely sensitive to summer precipitation and the hydrologic changes created by even small ditches or water diversions.

DE socio-environmental coevolution; technology; unintended consequences;

AB This paper uses a case study on the evolution of the Rhine river delta to illustrate the coevolution of the environment, the technology used to exploit it, and the institutions governing it. Three strands are interwoven:
   (1) Achieving equilibrium between protecting and utilizing land is difficult. In this area, as a result of exploitation, agriculture on fertile peat is succeeded by stock raising on infertile peat, peat extraction, inundation, and drainage to regain fertile soil.
   (2) In the dynamic between collective and individual action that accompanies these changes, individuals beget institutions and institutions beget individuals.
   (3) New technologies are invented, helping overcome challenges posed by the natural environment. Their unexpected consequences undermine the solutions found, leading to new technologies, etc.
   The ultimate cause is the interaction between human cognition and action. Our cognition is limited in the number of dimensions it can simultaneously handle, and our action (directly or indirectly) affects all the dimensions of the complex adaptive system that is the environment, triggering unintended consequences, and new actions. This feedback takes the system from perceived challenges to solutions to new, unintended challenges, driving the region further and further from its point of departure, towards the bottom of the sea.

AB This paper summarises the results of several research groups participating in the research programme "Greenhouse Impacts of the use of Peat and Peatlands in Finland", and presents emission factors for peat-atmosphere fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O, filling gaps in knowledge concerning the afforestation of organic croplands and cutaways, and improves the emission assessment of peatlands drained for forestry. Forest drainage may result in net binding of soil carbon or net release, depending on site characteristics and the tree stand. Use of peatlands for agriculture (48-4821 g CO2-eq. m(-2) a(-1)), even after the cultivation has ceased, or for milled peat harvesting (1948-2478 g CO2-eq. m(-2) a(-1)) can cause the highest overall emissions. Extremely high CO2 emissions are possible from peat harvesting areas during wet and warm summers. Afforestation of those peatlands abandoned from cultivation or peat harvesting can reduce the warming impact at least during the first tree generation. Heterotrophic soil respiration may have a systematic south-north difference in temperature response. More data must be collected before the information on peatland forest soil CO 2 emissions can be adapted for different climatic regions in Finland. A test of the model DNDC against measured data showed that DNDC has to be developed further before it can be used in estimating N2O emissions from boreal peatlands.

AB [1] Peatlands represent an important component of the global carbon cycle, storing 23 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Peatland mining eliminates the carbon sink function of the peatland. In this paper we measure the total ecosystem respiration in a natural, 2 and 3 year (young) and 7 and 8 year (old) postcutover peatland near Sainte-Marguerite- Marie, Quebec, during the summers of 1998 and 1999. Although the natural site was a source of CO2 during the dry 1998 study season (138 g C m(-2)), CO2 emissions were between 260 and 290% higher in the cutover sites (363 and 399 g C m(-2) for young and old, respectively). Cutover site CO2 emissions were only 88 and 112 g CO2-C m(-2) at the young and old sites during the wet 1999 study season. Total ecosystem respiration was more dependent on the water table position than on changes in the thermal regime or the labile carbon of the peat in a dry summer, but the opposite was the case in a wet summer. CO2 emissions increased with postharvest time regardless of a decrease in labile carbon, demonstrating that cutover peatlands are a large persistent source of atmospheric CO2. Direct measurement of the net ecosystem CO2 exchange in cutover peatlands, as opposed to determining the loss of carbon from bulk density determinations, provides a better understanding of how peat drainage and harvesting operations affect the carbon balance in peatlands.

AB This paper presents the results of field geophysical testing and laboratory testing of peat from Carn Park and Roosky raised bogs in the Irish Midlands. The motivation for the work was highlight the importance of these areas and to begin to attempt to understand the reasons for the failure of the bogs despite them having surface slopes of some 1A degrees. It was found that the peat is typical of that of Irish raised bogs being up to 8 m thick towards the "high" dome of the bogs. The peat is characterised by low density, high water content, high organic content, low undrained shear strength and high compressibility. The peat is also relatively permeable at in situ stress. Geophysical electrical resistivity tomography and ground penetrating radar data shows a clear thinning of the peat in the area of the failures corresponding to a reduction in volume from dewatering by edge drains/peat harvesting. This finding is supported by detailed water content measurements. It was also shown that the peat base topography is relatively flat and indicates that the observed surface movement has come from within the peat rather than from the material below the peat. Potential causes of the failures include conventional slope instability, the effect of seepage forces or the release of built-up gas in the peat mass. Further measurements are required in order to study these in more detail.

AB Spatial and seasonal variations in CO(2) and CH(4) concentrations in streamwater and adjacent soils were studied at three sites on Brocky Burn, a headwater stream draining a peatland catchment in upland Britain. Concentrations of both gases in the soil atmosphere were significantly higher in peat and riparian soils than in mineral soils. Peat and riparian soil CO(2) concentrations varied seasonally, showing a positive correlation with air and soil temperature. Streamwater CO(2) concentrations at the upper sampling site, which mostly drained deep peats, varied from 2.8 to 9.8 mg l(-1) (2.5 to 11.9 times atmospheric saturation) and decreased markedly downstream. Temperature-related seasonal variations in peat and riparian soil CO(2) were reflected in the stream at the upper site, where 77% of biweekly variation was explained by an autoregressive model based on: (i) a negative log-linear relationship with stream flow; (ii) a positive linear relationship with soil CO(2) concentrations in the shallow riparian wells; and (iii) a negative linear relationship With soil CO(2) concentrations in the shallow peat wells, with a significant 2-week lag term. These relationships changed markedly downstream, with an apparent decrease in the soil-stream linkage and a switch to a positive relationship between stream flow and stream CO(2). Streamwater CH4 concentrations also declined sharply downstream, but were much lower (<0.01 to 0.12 mg l(-1)) than those of CO(2) and showed no seasonal variation, nor any relationship with soil atmospheric CH4 concentrations. However, stream CH4 was significantly correlated with stream flow at the upper site, which explained 57% of biweekly variations in dissolved concentrations. We conclude that stream CO(2) can be a useful integrative measure of whole catchment respiration, but only at sites where the soil-stream linkage is strong. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Soil hydraulic properties of drained and cultivated fen soils vary considerably due to structural and physical alteration in the long-term. Although hydrological modelling is a key method to determine soil water conditions for a large number of aims, for instance the utilization of fen soils, general estimators of water retention that reflect the progressive nature of fen soil alteration are rare. Based on 405 horizons from 30 fen soil profiles at 12 different peatland sites in Germany soil hydraulic properties were estimated. Water retention and bulk density measurements were conducted fivefold per each horizon mapped after the German Soil Taxonomy. Considering the varying phases of moorsh-forming process, bulk densities and water retention data were clustered according to horizon category by applying the k-means method. This approach reduced the range of water contents measured at considered pressure heads (pF) and recommended their subdivision into three groups of graduated bulk density (high, moderate, low) per each horizon category. This subdivision resulted in 18 separated data sets for parameterisation of the selected van Genuchten model using the RETC software. Estimated water content at saturation ranged between 0.68 and 0.90 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.10 and 0.35 cm(3) cm(-3) at a pF-value of 4.2. Shape parameter a varied stronger than n, especially for the strongly altered fen soil horizons. The continuing alteration of the moorshifled, earthified, aggregated, and shrunken fen soil horizons classified by increasing bulk density levels was reflected by the estimated van Genuchten parameters. For horizons inventoried as unchanged peat substrates, less variability of bulk densities in combination with deviating van Genuchten parameters indicated the influence of additional factors on soil hydraulic properties.

AB In mires in the Netherlands and Poland redox potentials were measured in situ in 8-fold at 15 cm below the peat surface in 10 m(2) plots. Measurements were repeated 2-4 times in time at ca. 240 locations. Simultaneously, water levels were recorded in piezometers and water samples were analysed for pH(water). pH(KCl) was determined in peat samples. The relationship between water levels and measured redox potential was different in different mire types (Poor fen and bogs, Moderately-rich fens and Fen meadows). Moderately-rich fens did not differ from each other in redox potential at high water levels. Poor fens and bogs and Pen meadows showed a considerable variation in redox potentials at water levels between 0-25 cm. Moderately-rich fens (undrained) on solid peat showed distinctly lower redox potentials than bogs and poor fen at water levels of 20-30 cm, which points to the poorly decomposable character (low electron activity) of the organic matter in bogs and poor fen. Moderately-rich fens on solid peat showed distinctly lower redox potentials than in fen meadows at water levels deeper than 30 cm, which points to the strongly humified character (hardly any labile components left, low microbial activity, high redox potentials) of drained fen meadows compared to moderately-rich fen. In Pen meadows when water levels were below 40 cm to the pear surface, redox potentials were high and constant irrespective of the water levels. We concluded that a combination of water level and redox potential provides a much more ecologically relevant description of the site conditions in mires than water levels only. Redox measurements integrate both physical conditions and (seasonal) microbial activity.

AB Fen plants cultivated on wet peatlands might be an environmentally friendly alternative biogas substrate to maize and grass grown on drained peatlands. This study demonstrates that if Typha latifolia, Phragmites australis, and Phalaris arundinacea were harvested in mid-June, then their specific biogas yields (SBY) reached values of up to 581 L-N kg(-1) volatile solids (VS), which is similar to the SBY of grass, but lower than the SBY, of 670 L-N kg(-1) VS, for maize. Mixtures with equal or more than 10% T. latifolia or 40% P. arundinacea (VS-base) exhibited a reduced SBY compared to 100% maize silage in a batch-test. From the composition of the substrates, it remains unclear why fen plants degraded that poorly. However, during the semi-continuous long-term experiment, this effect led to an accumulation of non-degraded material, which destabilized the degradation process at loading rates above 3 kg VS m(-3) d(-1). Destabilization became apparent with substantial increases in the viscosity of the fermenter content, enrichment of acids and a worsened methane formation. Our findings suggest that only small proportions of maize could be replaced by fen plants as substrate for biogas plants. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The impacts of thinning at various intensities on the growth and mortality of mixed sprucebirch stands were investigated in thinning experiments on spruce swamps in northern and south-eastern Finland. At the time of establishment, three of the stands had recently reached the first commercial thinning stage and four were more advanced. The monitoring period was mainly 15 years, and the thinning intensity varied from heavy thinning (ca. 46 per cent of the basal area removed) to no thinning. Basal area removals of light and moderate thinning were ca. 22% and 39%, respectively.
   Unthinned plots had the highest volume increment. Light and moderate thinning slightly decreased the 15-year volume increment by, on an average, 1% and 8%, respectively. Heavy thinning led to a greater reduction (22%) in volume increment.
   The growth response to thinning intensity was evident as a higher relative volume and mean diameter increment of the living trees with decreasing stand density. Part of the volume increment on the unthinned plots was lost through natural mortality. Even light thinning significantly decreased natural mortality.

AB The use of drained peatlands as dairy grasslands leads to long-term organic matter losses, CO2 emissions and soil subsidence. It also yields grass with increased N and P contents compared to grass grown on mineral soils due to peat mineralisation, which often leads to greater farm surpluses of these elements. Growing Typha latifolia as a forage crop on rewetted peatlands (paludiculture) could reduce these issues. Therefore, the effects of harvest date and frequency on yield and nutritional value were studied in three experiments during the first growing season after establishment of two different T latifolia plantations. T latifolia produced 40-68 shoots m' and maximum dry matter (DM) yields of 9.81-10.89 Mg ha(-1). Harvesting before flowering resulted in the highest nutritional value per kg DM, of 563-575 g in vitro digestible organic matter (IVDOM), 120-128 g crude protein (CP), 287-300 g crude fibre (CF) and 1.5 g P. Surprisingly, harvesting at intervals of three or six weeks resulted in similar cumulative DM yields (p= 0.190). Also, average nutritional values per kg DM, especially of biomass harvested at 3-week intervals, remained similar to a May yield of 466-591 g IVDOM, 103-134 g CP and 286-303 g CF. Growing T latifolia fodder for inclusion in grass-based diets could reduce the environmental impacts of dairy farming on peat.

AB Samples from a pristine raised peat bog runoff in Austria, the Tannermoor creek, were analysed for their iron linked to natural organic matter (NOM) content. Dissolved organic carbon < 0.45 mu m (DOC) was 41-64 mg L-1, iron 4.4-5.5 mg L-1. Samples were analysed applying asymmetric field flow fractionation (AsFIFFF) coupled to UV-vis absorption, fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The samples showed an iron peak associated with the NOM peak, one sample exhibiting a second peak of iron independent from the NOM peak. As highland peat bogs with similar climatic conditions and vegetation to the Tanner Moor are found throughout the world, including areas adjacent to the sea, we examined the behaviour of NOM and iron in samples brought to euhaline (35%.) conditions with artificial sea salt. The enhanced ionic strength reduced NOM by 53% and iron by 82%. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of the samples at sea-like salinity revealed two major fractions of NOM associated with different iron concentrations. The larger one, eluting sharply after the upper exclusion limits of 4000-5000 g mol(-1), seems to be most important for iron chelating. The results outline the global importance of sub-mountainous and mountainous raised peat bogs as a source of iron chelators to the marine environment at sites where such peat bogs release their run-offs into the sea.

AB The analysis of experimental materials obtained in various regions of Russia and Belarus suggests that the thawing depth of plowed peat soils depends on the sum of mean daily air temperatures after the snow melting. The effect of other factors, including the latitudinal position of particular places, the water-physical properties of soils, and their geomorphic position on slopes of different aspects, is concealed by the major role of the heat flux from the atmosphere. The suggested exponential equation to describe this dependence can be applied for prediction of the thawing depth of arable peat soils in the European part of Russia and in West Siberia.

AB The Vallie-des-Ponts in the Jura mountains (Switzerland) is characterized by a complex hydraulic system, where drained peat bogs are crossed by a river (Bied Brook) which sinks into a karstic aquifer prior to rise as a spring (Noiraigue spring). A general chemical and microscopic survey of the particulate species throughout the basin highlighted the complex behaviour of iron-rich entities. Bulk chemical analyses show that iron is present as its dissolved and humics-complexed ferrous form in the anoxic-acidic pear porewater; the oxidation step of ferrous iron mainly occurs into drains, where conditions change from anoxic-acidic to oxic-neutral. Analytical electron microscopic characterization of individual colloids in the different compartments of this complex system suggests that iron is slowly oxidized to an abundant particulate form while it is transported by drains to the river, but these particles are then mostly retained when travelling through the karst. Small organic-rich granules, present as dominant species in the peat porewater, could act as condensation nuclei for the formation of iron-rich globular colloids containing significant amounts of calcium. These distinct particles have sizes in the 100-500 nm range and eventually contain a carbon-enriched core surrounded by a Fe-Ca-enriched outer layer. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB When a peatland is drained and cultivated, it behaves as a notable source of CO2. However, we lack temporally and spatially explicit estimates of carbon losses from cultivated peatlands. Using a process-based land surface model that explicitly includes representation of peatland processes, we estimate that northern peatlands converted to croplands emitted 72 Pg C over 850-2010, with 45% of this source having occurred before 1750. This source surpassed the carbon accumulation by high-latitude undisturbed peatlands (36 to 47 Pg C). Carbon losses from the cultivation of northern peatlands are omitted in previous land-use emission assessments. Adding this ignored historical land-use emission implies an 18% larger terrestrial carbon storage since 1750 to close the historical global carbon budget. We also show that carbon emission per unit area decrease with time since drainage, suggesting that time since drainage should be accounted for in inventories to refine land- use emissions from cultivated peatlands.

AB Depending on the soil preparation method applied and peat characteristics. Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings planted in prepared spots on forestry-drained peatlands may become more susceptible to extreme weather events such as drought or flooding. Only by studying its coping strategies can we eventually design methodology better suited for Scots pine regeneration on peat soils. In this study, we evaluated the tolerance of two-year-old seedlings to the two extremes of water-associated stress, drought and waterlogging, in unprocessed peat. Over one growing season in controlled conditions, drought distinctly reduced root and shoot growth in addition to photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m) particularly in previous-year needles, whilst wet stress had little discernible impact. Drought also influenced polyamine metabolism by increasing free putrescine and spermine concentrations especially in current-year needles, whereas no impact was discerned in the wet treatment. Furthermore, reduced root hydraulic conductance (K-r) was observed in drought-stressed root systems. Apparently, waterlogging does not modify Scots pine seedling growth or vitality immediately, but rather in the longer term. However, no fatalities occurred in either of the stress treatments, this despite water availability in the Sphagnum peat reaching its lower (permanent wilting point) and upper (10% soil air content) limits. Maintenance of rather high photochemical efficiency despite severe drought stress would seem to indicate a potential for seedling recovery if water availability in the peat substrate improved.

AB Drainage and peat extraction may have a negative impact on existing hydrological conditions and, consequently, on the conditions of wetland ecosystems. The aim of this study was to assess human impact on the studied Trzcinskie Mokradla Peatland by comparing the concentrations and trace element (Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr and Ni) pools in the study area (extracted vs. non-extracted areas of peatland). The concentration of trace elements in organic soils and their pools were analysed in relation to their depth in the soil profiles, content of organic matter, soil pH values and the degree of decomposition of organic materials (peat, mursh). Fifteen soil profiles (90 samples) were examined. The total soil elements content was determined after digestion in a mixture of HCl+HNO3. The element pools were calculated and expressed in g m(-2) of soil in 0-30 cm and 30-50 cm layers. Soils showed acidic or slightly acidic reactions. The high concentrations of Pb and Zn were mainly observed in the upper horizons. The deeper layers enriched with mineral fractions were also enriched in metals like Cr and Ni.

AB This investigation focuses on the development and nutrient status of the first Sitka spruce and Norway spruce stands established on milled cutaway peatlands in Ireland in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Phosphatic fertilization at planting is critical for the establishment of trees on cutaway peatlands but may not be sufficient to see the stands close canopy. Results from this study indicate the likely demand for P and N fertilizer during the rotation of these plantations. During the ten-year-study period (1994-2004), the nutrient status of both Norway and Sitka spruce stands deteriorated with the passage of time. Twenty-seven out of the twenty-eight examined stands became P deficient before 10 years old and half of the plots were N deficient within 13 to 15 years. Sitka spruce stands became N and P deficient earlier than Norway spruce. Regardless of species, tree stands growing on Sphagnum peat entered the critical N deficiency threshold sooner and were all severely deficient by 2004 compared to 22% of the trees growing on Phragmites peat. The effects of aerial re-fertilization were also site specific and although P deficiency was cured, the trees were likely to suffer from nutrient imbalance (N and Cu especially). These results demand a change of standard fertilization practices, which should be related more specifically to peat type and species requirements. Peat type identification and foliar analysis monitoring should become standard management tools while the long-term continuous monitoring of these new forests would be very valuable throughout their first rotation.

AB Globally, large areas of peatland have been drained through the digging of ditches, generally to increase agricultural production. By lowering the water table it is often assumed that drainage reduces landscape-scale emissions of methane (CH4) into the atmosphere to negligible levels. However, drainage ditches themselves are known to be sources of CH4 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs), but emissions data are scarce, particularly for carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), and show high spatial and temporal variability. Here, we report dissolved GHGs and diffusive fluxes of CH4 and CO2 from ditches at three UK lowland fens under different management; semi-natural fen, cropland, and cropland restored to low-intensity grassland. Ditches at all three fens emitted GHGs to the atmosphere, but both fluxes and dissolved GHGs showed extensive variation both seasonally and within-site. CH4 fluxes were particularly large, with medians peaking at all three sites in August at 120-230 mg m(-2) d(-1). Significant between site differences were detected between the cropland and the other two sites for CO2 flux and all three dissolved GHGs, suggesting that intensive agriculture has major effects on ditch biogeochemistry. Multiple regression models using environmental and water chemistry data were able to explain 29-59% of observed variation in dissolved GHGs. Annual CH4 fluxes from the ditches were 37.8, 183 and 272 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) for the semi-natural, grassland and cropland, and annual CO2 fluxes were similar (1100 to 1440 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)) among sites. We suggest that fen ditches are important contributors to landscape scale GHG emissions, particularly for CH4. Ditch emissions should be included in GHG budgets of human modified fens, particularly where drainage has removed the original terrestrial CH4 source, e.g. agricultural peatlands.

AB There is growing interest in how the rewetting of drained peatlands can restart their carbon (C) sink function. However, there are few studies on the effect of ditch blocking on the within-ditch C balance. For a UK blanket bog we assessed how methane (CH4) emissions, net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) balance expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e) responded to ditch blocking.
   We conducted a fully replicated field trial on a blanket bog in the Upper Conwy catchment, North Wales, UK. Twelve parallel ditches, that ran approximately downslope, were investigated. Four were left open, four had peat dams installed at intervals of a few metres along their length, and four were partially infilled with peat (reprofiled) and dammed. For a period of four years after blocking, we measured peatland-atmosphere fluxes of CH4 and CO2 within the ditches.
   CH4 fluxes, NEE and overall GHG balance (expressed in terms of CO2-e) in the experimental area showed no evidence of varying systematically between the different types of ditch treatment (open, dammed, and reprofiled). In addition, there was little evidence that CH4 fluxes or CO2-e balance changed systematically with time since blocking.
   We found no evidence of consistent differences between blocking treatments in terms of CH4 emissions or overall CO2-e balance. There was high spatial and temporal variability in CO2 and CH4 fluxes within each treatment. We did not observe a post-blocking 'spike' in CH4 fluxes.

AB In boreal-drained peatland forests, tree growth is retarded by the gradual deterioration of drainage ditch networks. In order to avoid the development of suboptimal growth conditions, ditch network maintenance (DNM) operations (ditch cleaning and/or complementary ditching) are annually conducted on an area of about 70,000 ha in Finland. The previous studies indicate that the depth of the water table prior to DNM may influence the magnitude of the growth response to DNM. Tree growth does not necessarily increase after DNM at sites with large stand volume and subsequent low water levels due to tree stand evapotranspiration. We investigated how the pre-treatment water table depth (pre-WTD) in late summer relates to the growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands after the DNM operation in 12 field experiments. The increase in mean annual volume growth caused by DNM was negatively related to the pre-WTD, with the highest growth response in stands where the pre-WTD was less than 25-30 cm. DNM did not clearly increase stand growth in sites where the pre-WTD was more than 35-40 cm below the soil surface. There was a high variation in growth response to DNM between the water levels from 20 to 35 cm below the soil surface, indicating that factors other than water table depth are also needed as decision criteria for assessing the appropriate timing of ditch network maintenance.

AB Peatlands are globally-important terrestrial carbon stores as well as regional sources of potable water supply. Water draining from peatlands is rich in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which can be problematic for water treatment. However, it is unclear how future climate and sulfate deposition changes may impact DOC in peatland-derived potable water. The United Kingdom (UK) is a global hotspot that consumes 79% of all potable water derived directly from peatlands. Here, a physically-based hydrological model and a biogeochemical organic carbon model were used to predict discharge and DOC concentration in nine hotspots of peatland-derived potable water use in the UK under a range of 21st century climate and sulfate deposition scenarios. These nine catchments supply 72% of all peatland-derived water consumed in the UK and 57% of the global total, equivalent to the total domestic consumption of over 14 million people. Our simulations indicate that annual discharges will decrease and that mean annual DOC concentrations will increase under all future scenarios (by as much as 53.4% annually for the highest emissions scenario) in all catchments. Large increases (by as much as a factor of 1.6) in DOC concentration in the 2090s over the baseline period are projected for autumn and winter, seasons when DOC concentrations are already high in the baseline datasets such that water treatment works often reach their capacity to cope. The total DOC flux is largely insensitive to future climate change because the projected increase in DOC concentration is mostly counterbalanced by the projected decrease in discharge.

AB Afforestation is a significant cause of global peatland degradation. In some regions, afforested bogs are now undergoing clear-felling and restoration, often known as forest-to-bog restoration. We studied differences in watertable depth (WTD) and porewater chemistry between intact, afforested, and restored bogs at a raised bog and blanket bog location. Solute concentrations and principal component analysis suggested that water-table drawdown and higher electrical conductivity (EC) and ammonium (NH4-N) concentrations were associated with afforestation. In contrast, higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and phosphate (PO4-P) concentrations were associated with deforestation. Drying-rewetting cycles influenced seasonal variability in solute concentrations, particularly in shallower porewater at the raised bog location. WTD was significantly deeper in the oldest raised bog restoration site (similar to 9 years post-restoration) than the intact bog (mean difference = 62 cm). However, WTD in the oldest blanket bog restoration site (similar to 17 years post-restoration), where furrows had been blocked, was comparable to the intact bog (mean difference = 1.2 cm). When averaged for all porewater depths, NH4-N concentrations were significantly higher in the afforested than the intact sites (mean difference = 0.77 mg L-1) whereas significant differences between the oldest restoration sites and the intact sites included higher PO4-P (mean difference = 70 mu g L-1) in the raised bog and higher DOC (mean difference 5.6 mg L-1), EC (mean difference 19 mu S cm(-1)) and lower SUVA(254) (mean difference = 0.13 L mg(-1) m(-1)) in the blanket bog. Results indicate felled waste (brash) may be a significant source of soluble C and PO4-P. Mean porewater PO4-P concentrations were between two and five times higher in furrows and drains in which brash had accumulated compared to other locations in the same sites where brash had not accumulated. Creating and maintaining brash-free buffer zones may therefore minimise freshwater impacts. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the aim of addressing the broader issues of land use, climate change and energy crisis, eddy covariance measurements of energy and CO2 exchange from a bioenergy crop (reed canary grass, Phalaris arundinaceae, L) cultivated on a drained organic soil (a cutover peatland) in eastern Finland were initiated in the spring of 2004. Based on the climatically diverse dataset from the 2004 to 2010 period, the objectives of the work presented here are to characterize the interannual variability in water vapor exchange and to understand the linkage between energy and CO2 exchange from this perennial crop during two extreme growing seasons. Correcting the measured soil heat flux by accounting for the change in heat storage above the heat flux plates helped close the energy balance at this site. Interannual variability in ecosystem processes of energy and CO2 exchange were attributed primarily to marked differences in the amount and distribution of seasonal precipitation. Differences in the phonological development of the crop during seasons with contrasting climatic conditions were reflected in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) estimated from the radiation instruments installed on the tower. Wet years were characterized by an even distribution of seasonal precipitation, low to moderate air and soil temperatures, lower solar and net radiation intensities (owing to reduced number of bright sunshine hours and therefore, higher amount of diffuse sky radiation), moderate to saturated soil moisture conditions and lower vapor pressure deficit. These climatic conditions resulted in high bulk surface conductance (g(s)), high evapotranspiration (ET) and low sensible heat flux with a peak seasonal Bowen ratio (beta = 0.1). These conditions were favourable for a high uptake of atmospheric CO2. Dry years, on the contrary, were marked by long dry spells during important phases of crop growth, climatic and soil moisture stress leading to high evaporative demand, low g(s) values, reduced evapotranspiration and high sensible heat flux (beta = 0.3-0.4). On a seasonal basis, the ET losses during a dry year were 13% lower compared to those during a wet year. The corresponding reduction in gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), however, was to the extent of 21%. Owing to the ability of this perennial crop to sequester large amounts of atmospheric carbon into its above- and below-ground biomass, the water use efficiency (defined as the slope of the linear regression of monthly values of GEP against ET) of this cultivation system was found to be 9.1 g CO2 per kg of H2O lost as ET. The results stemming from this work further support our earlier conclusions that this bioenergy system is a suitable land use option on drained and abandoned cutover peatlands with a high potential for offsetting CO2 load to the atmosphere.

AB Salmonid populations were sampled in 64 first- and second-order headwater streams throughout the Republic of Ireland in 2008. Streams were selected from neighbouring sub-catchments dominated either by moorland or conifer plantations, across two soil types-peat soil and mineral soil. A range of chemical variables were measured on three occasions over the year. Brown trout and Atlantic salmon populations were quantified on a single occasion for density and biomass in each stream. Data were analysed to test the null hypothesis that neither land use nor soil type had a significant impact on fish or chemical metrics in the streams. Streams draining afforested catchments had a significantly lower pH, Delta pH and elevated TDOC, total phosphorus, total monomeric aluminium, ammonia and colour. Streams draining peat soil sub-catchments had significantly lower minimum pH and TON, and higher suspended solids, TDOC, ammonia, aluminium and colour. While density and biomass of brown trout were somewhat lower in afforested catchments, the difference was not significant. Densities and biomass of juvenile Atlantic salmon, however, were significantly lower in streams draining afforested catchments. Atlantic salmon also had a much lower threshold tolerance to deleterious forestry-mediated water chemistry than trout. Forestry-mediated acidification of streams apparently remains a severe threat to Atlantic salmon populations, despite the reduction of airborne sulphate pollutants, posing challenges to forest and fisheries managers.

AB Agricultural drainage of organic soils has resulted in vast soil subsidence and contributed to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California was drained over a century ago for agriculture and human settlement and has since experienced subsidence rates that are among the highest in the world. It is recognized that drained agriculture in the Delta is unsustainable in the long-term, and to help reverse subsidence and capture carbon (C) there is an interest in restoring drained agricultural land-use types to flooded conditions. However, flooding may increase methane (CH4) emissions. We conducted a full year of simultaneous eddy covariance measurements at two conventional drained agricultural peatlands (a pasture and a corn field) and three flooded land-use types (a rice paddy and two restored wetlands) to assess the impact of drained to flooded land-use change on CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the Delta. We found that the drained sites were net C and greenhouse gas (GHG) sources, releasing up to 341g Cm(-2)yr(-1) as CO2 and 11.4g Cm(-2)yr(-1) as CH4. Conversely, the restored wetlands were net sinks of atmospheric CO2, sequestering up to 397g Cm(-2)yr(-1). However, they were large sources of CH4, with emissions ranging from 39 to 53g Cm(-2)yr(-1). In terms of the full GHG budget, the restored wetlands could be either GHG sources or sinks. Although the rice paddy was a small atmospheric CO2 sink, when considering harvest and CH4 emissions, it acted as both a C and GHG source. Annual photosynthesis was similar between sites, but flooding at the restored sites inhibited ecosystem respiration, making them net CO2 sinks. This study suggests that converting drained agricultural peat soils to flooded land-use types can help reduce or reverse soil subsidence and reduce GHG emissions.

AB Artificial drainage networks established throughout peatlands during the peat extraction process often remain active following abandonment, maintaining a water table relatively far from the surface of the peat, and hindering the survival and reestablishment of Sphagnum mosses. As an initial restoration effort, the primary drainage network of an abandoned cutover peatland was blocked with a series of peat dams, consequently reducing the runoff efficiency and causing the site-average water table to rise by 32 cm. Higher water tables and a blocked drainage network resulted in increased runoff variability, dependent upon antecedent conditions (capacity to retain additional water on-site), and event-based precipitation dynamics. Evapotranspiration (ET) rates were 25% higher following rewetting (3.6 mm day(-1)) compared to pre-restoration ET rates of 2.7 mm day(-1). Total storage changes were restricted following rewetting, as a factor of the reduced runoff losses limiting water table drawdown, thereby constraining peat compression and preventing undue drying of the unsaturated zone. An average surface level rebound of 3 cm was observed, increasing the mean hydraulic conductivity by an order of magnitude. Changes to the system hydrology following restoration efforts produced hydrological conditions more favourable for the recolonization of Sphagnum mosses.

AB A trait-based approach was used to evaluate the restoration success of a moss layer transfer technique on the herbaceous community of a cut-over bog. In order to understand the herbaceous dynamics following restoration, the bog was monitored prior to restoration and biannually over ten subsequent years, in two initial drainage conditions (dry peat fields and wet ditches), and compared to seven undisturbed bogs. Herbaceous community found prior to and in the early stage after restoration were characterized by species associated to mesic soil conditions with a fen-like pH, ruderal or wetland species, species with mycorrhiza or exotic species. These species did not persist in the latter stage after restoration and were replaced by species that are carnivorous, are associated to variable water availability and show mostly sexual reproduction. The extent of changes in traits composition of the herbaceous community between the early and latter stages after restoration showed the importance of multiple-year monitoring to evaluate restoration projects. The trait composition found in the latter stage after restoration appeared to converge toward the reference ecosystem where the community was characterized by species with large seeds, associated to humid soil conditions and a forest or peatland habitat. Lower trait diversity was found in the latter stage after restoration than in the reference ecosystem, especially in peat fields. In addition, species and functional diversity pattern varied with the initial drainage conditions, decreasing in peat fields while remaining stable in ditches. This suggests that different initial topography for restoration might help increase species and functional diversity of a managed ecosystem. Finally, our results outline measures to improve the moss layer transfer technique: sowing herbaceous species with large seeds in the latter stage after restoration, applying the restoration technique as soon as exploitation has terminated or removing all vegetation (including seeds and rhizomes) from the site to be restored.

AB Plant species-rich Calthion meadows on mesotrophic fen pear soil extensively cut for hay are among the endangered semi-natural vegetation types in northwestern Europe. They are often badly affected by lowering the groundwater table (drainage) and fertilization.
   In a comparative study of an undrained site with a Calthion meadow and an adjacent drained site, availability of N, P and K was biologically assessed under field conditions (for two years) as well as in a greenhouse (for 18 weeks) by measuring shoot responsiveness. Also, experimental wetting of intact turf samples taken from both sites was applied in order to study the interaction between nutrient supply and anaerobic soil conditions. It was concluded that the above-ground phytomass yield in the undrained site was restricted by a major shortage of N-supply and a moderate shortage of K-supply by the fen peat soil. The above-ground phytomass yield of the drained site was only reduced by a strongly limited supply of K by the soil. The extent of K-deficiency was larger for the drained site. No P-deficiency was observed in any of the drained or undrained sites. Rewetting turf samples, taken from the drained site, did not change above-ground phytomass yields, suggesting that nutrient supplies were not affected by rewetting. Leaching has likely resulted in a strong reduction of K-supply in the drained site. It is assumed that a shortage in K-supply from the peat soil may have become an important environmental constraint for characteristic plant species of Calthion meadows. This may hamper the development of this meadow type on drained peat soils after rewetting by groundwater discharge.

DT Article

AB The effect of ash fertilization on height growth and volume production of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) was studied on oligotroph peatland in southeast Norway. In the year 1944, plots 15 m x 15 m size were fertilized with 0, 4, 7, and 10 tons ha(-1) of wood or peat ash. The area was treeless, but a satisfactory number of pine seedlings were present. All measurements were confined to the central inner plot, 10 m x 10 m area. Most plots were re-fertilized with 10 tons of wood ash ha(-1) in the year 1993. Wood ash had higher content of nutrients, and generally, it had greater growth enhancement effect than peat ash. When the amount of ash was increased, volume production significantly increased for the age period 38-50 years and the total production at age 50 years. The mean annual increment during the first 50 years was about 6 m(3) ha(-1) for the plots applied with 10 tons of ash ha(-1). Trees on plots fertilized with 7 or 10 tons in 1944 and replenished with 10 tons ha(-1) at age 50 years (1993) had a mean annual increment of 14 m(3) ha(-1) for the stand age period 51-68 years. Over time some tree roots from control plots and plots fertilized with 4 tons ha(-1) have captured nutrients from richer plots. Such effect is to a smaller extent relevant for treatment 7 tons. It is concluded that the content of mineral nutrients of wood and peat ash makes these ashes well suited as fertilizers on peatland.

TI Aquatic effects of peat extraction and peatland forest drainage: a

AB The aquatic effects of forestry practices and peat extraction continue to cause serious concerns. The effect mechanisms of peat extraction on water quality and aquatic ecology of the receiving surface waters are well known, but the impacts are often difficult to differentiate from those of forest management. A pairwise temporal sediment study was conducted on two adjacent lakes in Central Finland to study whether the unique effects of peat extraction can be detected in an area of intensive forest drainage. Both lakes are affected by forestry, but the reference lake has no history of peat extraction in its watershed. The deepest parts of the lakes were cored through the lacustrine sediments, and the recent carbon and dry matter sedimentation rates were compared to their site-specific reference values. Recent changes in benthic macroinvertebrates (chironomids) and diatom algae were studied to assess the ecological effects of these practices in the lakes. No significant differences in recent increases in carbon accumulation were found between the peat extraction-impacted lake and the reference lake. The pairwise comparison allowed identification of a regional pattern of impacts that is closely related to the history of land use, particularly forestry, in the region. The approach also allowed identification of the transient signs of peat extraction in the chemical and chironomid records of the impacted lake. The recent changes in chironomids and diatoms suggest eutrophication and deterioration in benthic conditions likely caused by drainage ditch network maintenance activities in the catchments.

AB Peatlands and forests cover large areas of the boreal biome and are critical for global climate regulation. They also regulate regional climate through heat and water vapour exchange with the atmosphere. Understanding how land-atmosphere interactions in peatlands differ from forests may therefore be crucial for modelling boreal climate system dynamics and for assessing climate benefits of peatland conservation and restoration. To assess the biophysical impacts of peatlands and forests on peak growing season air temperature and humidity, we analysed surface energy fluxes and albedo from 35 peatlands and 37 evergreen needleleaf forests-the dominant boreal forest type-and simulated air temperature and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) over hypothetical homogeneous peatland and forest landscapes. We ran an evapotranspiration model using land surface parameters derived from energy flux observations and coupled an analytical solution for the surface energy balance to an atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) model. We found that peatlands, compared to forests, are characterized by higher growing season albedo, lower aerodynamic conductance, and higher surface conductance for an equivalent VPD. This combination of peatland surface properties results in a similar to 20% decrease in afternoon ABL height, a cooling (from 1.7 to 2.5 degrees C) in afternoon air temperatures, and a decrease in afternoon VPD (from 0.4 to 0.7 kPa) for peatland landscapes compared to forest landscapes. These biophysical climate impacts of peatlands are most pronounced at lower latitudes (similar to 45 degrees N) and decrease toward the northern limit of the boreal biome (similar to 70 degrees N). Thus, boreal peatlands have the potential to mitigate the effect of regional climate warming during the growing season. The biophysical climate mitigation potential of peatlands needs to be accounted for when projecting the future climate of the boreal biome, when assessing the climate benefits of conserving pristine boreal peatlands, and when restoring peatlands that have experienced peatland drainage and mining.

AB Drained peatlands contribute to anthropic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), so a better understanding of the underlying processes and identification of mitigation options for agricultural peatlands are urgently required. Peatland soil properties vary greatly and, in combination with drainage, can affect emissions of CO2 both directly and indirectly. Drainage reduces soil water content but increases CO2 production, so it is important to find the optimum drainage level that minimises CO2 emissions without affecting agricultural use. Intact soil cores from nine different sites (topsoil, plus subsoil at four sites) were collected and brought into a controlled laboratory environment. Repeated measurements of CO2 fluxes were performed at increasing soil water suctions corresponding to different drainage levels. Physical and chemical properties of the soils were determined and compared with the CO2 emissions. The soil cores displayed different CO2 emission patterns with increasing soil water suction head. In some cores, emissions increased rapidly to a high level, while in others they remained at lower levels. At a soil water suction head of only 0.5 m of water, the average soil CO2 emissions had already reached a maximum. The soil cores represented peat soils with a wide range of soil properties, e.g. bulk density from 0.17 to 0.47 g cm(-3) and total carbon from 26.3 to 43.5 %, but none of the properties measured was clearly correlated with CO2 emissions.

AB The drainage of low-lying peatland for agriculture and subsequent conservation measures adopted on some of these peatlands has led to differing degrees of change in the physical and hydraulic characteristics of the soil. We assessed the degree of peat decomposition and measured the soil organic matter (SOM) content, particle density, dry bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and water retention and shrinkage characteristics for a range of peat soil horizons sampled in two low-lying agricultural peatland in England. The physical and hydraulic properties of the peats considered were significantly influenced by the degree of decomposition. Higher decomposition resulted in lower SOM content, higher bulk density and lower porosity. In addition, pedogenic alterations due to intensive drainage and land use lead to a greater degradation of the soil structure in the upper soil layers. Less decomposed peats had a higher propensity to shrink under increasing water potentials. They had a lower air entry pressure and drained faster than degraded peats. In addition, they had a higher saturated hydraulic conductivity. This shows that decomposition and pedogenic alterations lead to the loss of structural pores. Hence decomposition and humification result in the degradation of the soil structure and a reduction in the soil capacity to store, retain and transmit water. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB The drainage of a riparian peatland interspersed with organic and mineral substrates in Northern Germany has led to subsidence morphology due to mineralisation, initial settlement and shrinkage processes causing cultivation problems and yield declines. To explain the relevancy of shrinkage to changes of the surface morphology and soil properties, organic and mineral substrates were analysed with regard to (1) shrinkage potential (i.e. the maximum shrinkage), (2) shrinkage curve, (3) actual in situ shrinkage and (4) irreversible shrinkage proportions.
   The investigated substrates are sedge peat, peat-clay, half-bog and alluvial sand of Fibric Limnic Histosols (Drainic) and a glacial clay for comparison. The methods used to obtain the shrinkage curves include the consideration of crack formation due to desiccation, as digital photography and image analysis were used in addition to height change measurements. To characterise the actual in situ shrinkage, continuous records of the soil matric potential for a 4.5-year period at two different intensively drained Histosols (moderately and deeply drained: mean groundwater table 0.6 and 1.7 m under ground level) were accomplished in four depths (15, 40, 70, 100 cm).
   The measured shrinkage potentials vary between 2% (alluvial sand) and 65% (peat-clay). The sedge peat and peat-clay are characterised by distinct higher shrinkage potentials compared to the glacial clay and show distinct proportional shrinkage. It has to be pointed out that the soil volume loss partly even exceeds the loss in water volume. The sedge peat does not reach residual or zero shrinkage but shows distinct structural shrinkage at initial desiccation. For the moderately drained site, matric potentials reached up to -60 kPa in summer in 15-cm depth, whilst capillary rise almost prevented desiccation of deeper zones. For the deeply drained site, summer desiccation reached deeper zones as well (matric potential up to -50 kPa in 40-cm depth) due to absent capillary rise. In the range of actually occurring maximum desiccation, the half-bog and peat-clay with high decomposed organic matter are particularly affected by shrinkage with volume decreases of 10-14%, in contrast to the fibred sedge peat with only 4%. When uniquely shrunken substrates will be re-wetted, distinct irreversible shrinkage proportions reaching between 18% and 31% subsequent to drying to a matric potential of -50 kPa and re-saturation were measured.
   Particularly, the organic-rich substrates appeared as characteristically sensitive to soil shrinkage. Contrary to mineral substrates, they lack in solid particles, leading, along with high hydraulic stresses due to dominantly finer pores, to intense volume decreases after desiccation. These substrates therefore partly also lack in residual or zero shrinkage, and the soil volume loss can even exceed the water loss due to shrinkage. Accordingly, the alterations of soil properties, e.g. conductivities, are especially pronounced.
   The calculated proportion of actual in situ shrinkage (0.5 to 1 dm) to total subsidence of the investigated peatland is rather low for the deeply drained site in comparison to initial settlement (2-3 dm) and long-term active mineralisation (e.g. 4 dm in 40 years, mineralisation rate 1 cm year(-1)) but accelerates the latter because of enhanced aeration due to crack formation. Irreversible shrinkage is one reason why re-wetted fen peats do not retrieve their initial volume as well as their initial physical and hydraulic properties. Thus, a re-wetting of drained fen peats can only preserve the present condition.
   To impede the further impairment of riparian peatlands, it is necessary to maintain a near-surface water table particularly throughout the summer months, when high desiccation occurs, leading to a spatially differentiated proportion of initial settlement, shrinkage and mineralisation, causing subsidence morphology. Our recommendation is a drainage depth of less than 60 cm to enable pasture or grassland land use and to minimise mineralisation as well as structure formation in the (sub)soil.

AB Drainage and conversion of natural peatlands to forestry increases soil CO2 emissions through decomposition of peat and modifies the quantity and quality of litter inputs and therefore the soil carbon balance. In organic soils, CO2 net emissions and removals are reported using carbon emission factors (EF). The choice of specific default Tier 1 EF values from the IPCC 2013 Wetlands supplement depends on land-use categories and climate zones. However, Tier 1 EF for afforested peatlands in the temperate maritime climate zone are based on data from eight sites, mainly located in the hemiboreal zone, and the uncertainty associated with these default values is a concern. In addition, moving from Tier 1 to higher-Tier carbon reporting values is highly desirable when large areas are affected by land-use changes. In this study, we estimated site-specific soil carbon balance for the development of Tier 2 soil CO2-C EFs for afforested peatlands. Soil heterotrophic respiration and aboveground tree litterfall were measured during two years at eight afforested peatland sites in Ireland. In addition, fine-root turnover rate and site-specific fine-root biomass were used to quantify belowground litter inputs. We found that drainage of peatlands and planting them with either Sitka spruce or lodgepole pine, resulted in soils being net carbon sources. The soil carbon balance at multi-year sites varied between 63 +/- 92 and 309 +/- 67 g C m(-2) year(-1). Mean CO2-C EF for afforested peatlands was 1.68 +/- 0.33 t CO2-C ha(-1) year(-1). The improved CO2-C EFs presented here for afforested peatlands are proposed as a basis to update national CO2-C emissions from this land-use class in Ireland. Furthermore, new data from these sites will significantly contribute to the development of more reliable IPCC default Tier 1 CO2-C EFs for afforested peatlands in the maritime temperate climate zone.

AB Peatland restoration via rewetting aims to recover biological communities and biogeochemical processes typical to pristine peatlands. While rewetting promotes recovery of C accumulation favorable for climate mitigation, it also promotes methane (CH4) emissions. The potential for exceptionally high emissions after rewetting has been measured for Central European peatland sites previously grazed by cattle. We addressed the hypothesis that these exceptionally high CH4 emissions result from the previous land use. We analyzed the effects of cattle dung application to peat soils in a short-(2 weeks), a medium-(1 year) and a long-term (grazing) approach. We measured the CH4 production potentials, determined the numbers of methanogens by mcrA qPCR, and analyzed the methanogen community by mcrA T-RFLP-cloning-sequencing. Dung application significantly increased the CH4 production potential in the short-and the medium-term approach and non-significantly at the cattle-grazed site. The number of methanogens correlated with the CH4 production in the short-and the long-term approach. At all three time horizons, we found a shift in methanogen community due to dung application and a transfer of rumen methanogen sequences (Methanobrevibacter spp.) to the peatland soil that seemed related to increased CH4 production potential. Our findings indicate that cattle grazing of drained peatlands changes their methanogenic microbial community, may introduce rumen-associated methanogens and leads to increased CH4 production. Consequently, rewetting of previously cattle-grazed peatlands has the potential to lead to increased CH4 emissions. Careful consideration of land use history is crucial for successful climate mitigation with peatland rewetting.

AB Peatlands represent a globally important carbon store; however, the human exploitation of this ecosystem is increasing both the frequency and severity of fires on drained peatlands. Yet, the interactions between the hydrological conditions (ecotopes), the fuel types being burned, the burn severity, and the charring temperatures (pyrolysis intensity) remain poorly understood. Here we present a post-burn assessment of a fire on a lowland raised bog in Co. Offaly, Ireland (All Saints Bog). Three burn severities were identified in the field(light, moderate, and deeply burned), and surface charcoals were taken from 17 sites across all burn severities. Charcoals were classified into two fuel type categories (either ground or above ground fuel) and the reflectance of each charcoal particle was measured under oil using reflectance microscopy. Charcoal reflectance shows a positive relationship with charring temperature and as such can be used as a temperature proxy to reconstruct minimum charring temperatures after a fire event. Resulting median reflectance values for ground fuels are 1.09 +/- 0.32% Ro(median), corresponding to estimated minimum charring temperatures of 447 degrees C +/- 49 degrees C. In contrast, the median charring temperatures of aboveground fuels were found to be considerably higher, 646 degrees C +/- 73 degrees C (3.58 +/- 0.77% Ro(median)). A mixed-effects modeling approach was used to demonstrate that the interaction effects of burn severity, as well as ecotope classes, on the charcoal reflectance is small compared to the main effect of fuel type. Our findings reveal that the different fuel types on raised bogs are capable of charring at different temperatures within the same fire, and that the pyrolysis intensity of the fire on All Saints Bog was primarily driven by the fuel types burning, with only a weak association to the burn severity or ecotope classes.

AB Anthropogenic drainage and cutting over of peatlands have historically occurred worldwide leading to erosion, issues with water quality, loss of biodiversity, and reduced rates of carbon accumulation. In recent years, rewetting measures have attempted to address these issues. Creating dams to block drainage ditches on peatlands is a common restoration tool, yet the ecological consequences of such management interventions are poorly understood. In particular, knowledge about the ecology of the thousands of pools created by drain blocking is limited even though they potentially provide valuable new habitat for aquatic species and food and water sources for terrestrial organisms. More research is needed to assess the suitability of these artificial pools as surrogates for naturally occurring peat pools with regard to the flora (e.g., bryophytes, algae, and macrophytes) and fauna (e.g., invertebrates and amphibians), which utilize them. Evidence suggests that (1) to maximize benefits to aquatic biota, land managers should consider creating an array of differently sized pools behind the dams as a broader size range would facilitate colonization by a wider range of taxa, (2) prioritizing landscapes close to existing water bodies would encourage faster colonization, and (3) even newly created pools with low macrophyte cover may be able to sustain substantial populations of larger fauna via algal primary production, consumption of detritus, andmicrobial processing of humic substances and methane. Ongoing programs of peatland restoration worldwide also afford unique opportunities to study how pool communities assemble and change over time. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Remote sensing methods make it possible to evaluate the reaction of the cryolithozone and tundra landscapes in hard-to-reach Arctic areas based on the indicators of modern climate changes. In 2016-2019, numerous organic frost boils were discovered on the peatland surfaces of drained lakes in the southern tundra of the Pur-Taz interfluve in the northern part of West Siberia and studied. It is established that the formation of frost boils caused by organic mass injections occurs in the summertime and that they indicate local deepening of seasonal thawing. Frost boils emerging at peatlands in summertime was identified after analysis of UAV survey in 2019. Local deepening of seasonal thaw layer on polygonal peatlands is evidence of permafrost reaction to global warming.

In order to increase a water retention in headwaters the detailed analysis of peat bogs hydrological function needs to be carried out. Suitable conditions for the research realization at present is related to an existence of several automatic water level gauges and utilization of modern equipment and methods in experimental catchments of the Otava River headstream area (Sumava Mts., southwestern Czechia), representing the core zone of a number of extreme floods in Central Europe. Thorough analyses of extreme runoff phases show more distinct discharge variability of streams draining peat land localities. For the retention potential assessment the detailed measurement of potential accumulation reservoirs, bathymetric mapping of bog pools and the detailed analysis of snow conditions as an important component of a rainfall-runoff process in headwaters is being pursued. The final part of the paper is consisted of suggestions of several unforceable measures implementation that could contribute to reduction of peak flows and to increase of water resources during extreme droughts in future.

   EXCHANGE; VEGETATION; SOILS
AB Natural peatlands are important carbon sinks and sources of methane (CH4). In contrast, drained peatlands turn from a carbon sink to a carbon source and potentially emit nitrous oxide (N2O). Rewetting of peatlands thus potentially implies climate change mitigation. However, data about the time span that is needed for the re-establishment of the carbon sink function by restoration are scarce. We therefore investigated the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) balances of three differently vegetated sites of a bog ecosystem 30 years after rewetting. All three vegetation communities turned out to be sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) ranging between 0.6 +/-1.43 tCO(2) ha(-2) yr(-1) (Sphagnum-dominated vegetation) and 3.09 +/- 3.86 tCO(2) ha(-2) yr(-1) (vegetation dominated by heath). While accounting for the different global warming potential (GWP) of CO2, CH4 and N2O, the annual GHG balance was calculated. Emissions ranged between 25 and 53 tCO(2)-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) and were dominated by large emissions of CH4 (22-51 tCO(2)-eq ha(-1) yr(-1)), with highest rates found at purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea) stands. These are to our knowledge the highest CH4 emissions so far reported for bog ecosystems in temperate Europe. As the restored area was subject to large fluctuations in the water table, we assume that the high CH4 emission rates were caused by a combination of both the temporal inundation of the easily decomposable plant litter of purple moor grass and the plant-mediated transport through its tissues. In addition, as a result of the land use history, mixed soil material due to peat extraction and refilling can serve as an explanation. With regards to the long time span passed since rewetting, we note that the initial increase in CH4 emissions due to rewetting as described in the literature is not inevitably limited to a short-term period.

AB The aim of the study was to assess the effects of fen rewetting on carabid beetle and vascular plant assemblages within riverine fens along the river Peene in north-eastern Germany. Drained (silage grassland), rewetted (restored formerly drained silage grassland), and near-natural (fairly pristine) stands were compared. Eighty-four beetle species (7,267 individuals) and 135 plant species were recorded. The richness of vascular plant species and the number of endangered species were highest on near-natural fens. Fourteen years of rewetting did not increase plant species numbers compared with drained fens. For carabid beetles, however, species richness and the number of stenotopic species were highest on rewetted fens. Rewetting caused the replacement of generalist carabids by wetland specialists, but did not provide suitable habitat for specialist fen carabids or for plant species of oligo- or mesotrophic fen communities. Therefore, raising the water table on fens with nutrient-rich, degraded peat was not sufficient for restoring species assemblages of intact fens, although water level was the most important environmental factor separating species assemblages. Our study illustrated that insects and plants may respond differentially to restoration, stressing the need to consider different taxa when assessing the efficiency of fen restoration. Furthermore, species assemblages of intact fens could not be restored within 14 years, highlighting the importance of conserving pristine habitat.

AB ContextAn increased interest in the restoration of peatlands for delivering multiple benefits requires a greater understanding of the extent and location of natural and artificial features that contribute to degradation.ObjectivesWe assessed the utility of multiple, fine-grained remote sensing datasets for mapping peatland features and associated degraded areas at a landscape-scale. Specifically, we developed an integrated approach to identify and quantify multiple types of peatland degradation including: anthropogenic drainage ditches and peat cuttings; erosional gullies and bare peat areas.MethodsAirborne LiDAR, CASI and aerial image datasets of the South West UK, were combined to identify features within Dartmoor National Park peatland area that contribute to degradation. These features were digitised and quantified using ArcGIS before appropriate buffers were applied to estimate the wider ecohydrologically affected area.ResultsUsing fine-scale, large-extent remotely sensed data, combined with aerial imagery enabled key features within the wider expanse of peatland to be successfully identified and mapped at a resolution appropriate to future targeted restoration. Combining multiple datasets increased our understanding of spatial distribution and connectivity within the landscape. An area of 29km(2) or 9.2% of the Dartmoor peatland area was identified as significantly and directly ecohydrologically degraded.ConclusionsUsing a combination of fine-grained remotely sensed datasets has advantages over traditional ground survey methods for identification and mapping of anthropogenic and natural erosion features at a landscape scale. The method is accurate, robust and cost-effective particularly given the remote locations and large extent of these landscapes, facilitating effective and targeted restoration planning, management and monitoring.

AB Peatland drainage is an important driver of global soil carbon loss and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Restoration of peatlands by reflooding reverses CO2 losses at the cost of increased methane (CH4) emissions, presenting a biogeochemical compromise. While restoring peatlands is a potentially effective method for sequestering carbon, the terms of this compromise are not well constrained. Here we present 14 site years of continuous CH4 and CO2 ecosystem-scale gas exchange over a network of restored freshwater wetlands in California, where long growing seasons, warm weather, and managed water tables result in some of the largest wetland ecosystem CH4 emissions recorded. These large CH4 emissions cause the wetlands to be strong greenhouse gas sources while sequestering carbon and building peat soil. The terms of this biogeochemical compromise, dictated by the ratio between carbon sequestration and CH4 emission, vary considerably across small spatial scales, despite nearly identical wetland climate, hydrology, and plant community compositions.
   Plain Language Summary Wetlands play an important role in the climate system, with restoration commonly undertaken for the benefit of atmospheric carbon dioxide removal and carbon storage in the soil. While flooded conditions suppress carbon dioxide emissions from decomposition and sequester carbon, they also generate methane, another potent heat-trapping greenhouse gas. Understanding the balance between these exchanges is important to our understanding of how restored or created wetlands will contribute to mitigating climate change. Here we present a long-term record of continuous carbon dioxide and methane exchange from restored wetlands in Northern California to understand the ultimate climate impact of wetland restoration.

AB The restoration of drained peatlands to re-establish biodiverse peat-forming plant communities and typical habitats is a long-term process. To document this process, monitoring concepts must be found that are as operational, cost-effective and non-invasive as possible for the new sensitive ecosystems. The monitoring of the developing plant communities using multisensory Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data has great potential. We investigated two fen sites in north-eastern Germany that were rewetted in the late 1990s. The areas were flown with a Fixed-Wing UAV and three sensors (RGB, multispectral, thermal). A multisensor dataset consisting of the sensor data, plant height and five spectral indices was classified with a random forest algorithm. The classification accuracies were 87.1 and 89.0% for 10 and 11 classes for the respective sites. Furthermore, the band importance was analyzed using the Gini index. Plant height in combination with the multispectral information were the most important variables. This study underlines the suitability of UAVs for monitoring spectrally similar vegetation because of their capability to generate 3D surface models using structure-from-motion methods and to carry different sensor systems. In addition, they can be used on a regional scale and mostly independent of cloud cover. Secondary results of the study are that the band importance can be determined by Random Forest algorithms even with few trees (e.g. 10 trees), because the order remains very stable independently of the number of trees.

ID PEAT
AB Smouldering fire vulnerability in organic-rich, wetland soils is regulated by hydrologic regimes over short (by antecedent wetness) and long (through influences on soil properties) timescales. An integrative understanding of these controls is needed to inform fire predictions and hydrologic management to reduce fire vulnerability. The Great Dismal Swamp, a drained peatland (Virginia and North Carolina, USA), recently experienced large wildfires, motivating hydrologic restoration efforts. To inform those efforts, we combined continuous water levels, soil properties, moisture holding capacity and smouldering probability at four sites along a hydrologic gradient. For each site, we estimated gravimetric soil moisture content associated with a 50% smouldering probability (soil moisture smoulder threshold) and the water tension required to create this moisture threshold (tension smoulder threshold). Soil properties influenced both thresholds. Soils with lower bulk density smouldered at higher moisture content but also had higher moisture holding capacity, indicating that higher tensions (e.g. deeper water tables) are required to reach smouldering thresholds. By combining thresholds with water level data, we assessed smouldering vulnerability over time, providing a framework to guide fire prediction and hydrologic restoration. This work is among the first to integrate soil moisture thresholds, moisture holding capacities and water level dynamics to explore spatiotemporal variation in smouldering fire vulnerability.

AB We describe an ombrotrophic bog profile from Tinovul Mohos, Eastern Carpathians, Romania to quantitatively reconstruct the hydroclimate and the palaeoecological evolution over the past 1000 years. Findings are based on high-resolution analyses of testate amoebae, plant macrofossils, pollen, micro- and macrocharcoal, delta C-13 stable carbon isotopes, organic matter content and bulk density, supported by AMS radiocarbon dating. We identify five major hydroclimatic intervals. Between AD 1050 and 1300, a wet period occurred associated with a time of reduced human population. Between AD 1300 and 1600, wet conditions continued to prevail, but with tendency towards drier mire settings. The third period from AD 1600-1680 revealed two abrupt disturbances in the local hydrology (strong dry-wet shifts). The fourth period, from AD 1680-1950, showed intermediate moist conditions with an increased humidity. After AD 1950, mire conditions became dry and there was an intensification in disturbances activity (forest clearance, fire and peatland drainage). Our multi-proxy reconstruction represents one of the few studies of the hydroclimate and palaeoecological evolution of the last millennium in the central-eastern Europe. Findings show good agreement with other hydroclimate reconstructions from this region, but not with records from north-western Europe. More high-resolution multi-proxy studies are needed to improve our understanding of the feedback mechanisms in peatlands and the factors behind these changes.

AB Carer lepidacarpa Tausch subsp. lepidocarpa (section Ceratocystis) is a threatened plant growing in Finland only in the Aland Islands. It is restricted to intermediate and flark levels of calcareous rich fens, where it occurs both in mire margin and in mire expanse conditions. A comparison is made with the ecology of C. lepidocarpa subsp.jemtlandica Palmgr. in NE Finland. The vegetation of C. lepidocarpa localities was grouped with TWINSPAN classification analysis and DCA ordination analysis. A distribution map of C. lepidacarpa in Aland is presented. Hybridization with other species in the C. flava complex and especially with C. hostiana is frequent. C. lepidocarpa is sensitive to changes in the water table of the habitat, and it has strongly decreased in Aland because of the drainage of mires for agriculture and forestry. The overgrowth due to cessation of traditional agricultural management (mowing and grazing) is another threat to C. lepidocarpa, at least in mire margin conditions. The localities that remain contain several plants that are threatened in Finland and have a high conservation value.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions from managed peatlands have not been extensively studied in Western Patagonia. The objective of this study was to assess the annual CO2 emission from microbial carbon (C) mineralization in a peatland site under not saturated conditions at Tierra del Fuego. The annual CO2 emissions were measured from unsaturated soil samples (n = 41) under soil incubation at seasonal local temperatures to simulate CO2 emissions for a year, using a non-dispersive infrared gas analyser. Spatial models for total soil C and CO2 were calculated using discrete and continuous variables. The annual mean of measured cumulative CO2 was 1,358 mu g CO2 g soil(-1), lower than Northern peatlands, and 82% of the C mineralization occurred in the warmer season. The modelled CO2 in the warmer season showed levels of CO2 as high as 4 mg CO2 g soil(-1), but 66% of the area showed between 600-2000 mu g CO2 g soil(-1), which is 28%-92% and 9%-32% of CO2 values reported for crop rotations. Consequently, after a potential habilitation of the study area for agricultural use, the soil CO2 emissions from heterotrophic activity would become a C source to the global CO2 emissions. This ecosystem is highly exposed to the effects of the land-use change, and global temperature increase.

AB Four experiments were conducted simultaneously in a Alluvial Soil, a Low-Humic Gley, a Humic Gley and an artificially drained bog soil with the objective of evaluating the influence of liming and manure applied in previous bean crop on residual effects of phosphorus fertilization, extractor efficiency and acid phosphatase activity in aired soils before flooding in the prediction of P availability to rice cultivated after flooding. After the bean harvest, replicates of each treatment for each soil were mixed and 3.2 kg of soil were transferred to 5 L pots, which were used to cultivate the flooded rice experiment. At this time, soil samples were collected for phosphorus determination by Mehlich-1, Resin, Bray-1, solution equilibrium phosphorus and acid phosphatase activity. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 3 x 2 factorial scheme: three soil amendment practices (liming, gypsum, and no corrective) and two organic residue levels (with and without cow manure), with four replications. The soils remained flooded with a 3 cm water layer throughout the experimental period. After 60 days of flooding, rice plants were transplanted to pots and grown until grain maturity. The manure application led to an increase of P availability, grain dry matter, and foliar P concentration and content, whereas lime and gypsum showed no clear effect on the studied variables. The phosphorus extractors and acid phosphatase activity used in aired soils before the rice crop were not effective to predict phosphorus availability in the flooded soils.

AB The morphology and chemical characteristics of mineral soils underlying modern peaty (histic) and shallow peat soils (or histosols) are analyzed in pedoecological conditions of Estonia. The underlying shallow peat mantle gley soils have been formed on different geological origin (glaciolacustrine, glacial, glaciofluvial, marine) parent materials. The peat mantle overlying gley soils has accumulated in the process of landscape paludification during the post glacial period. Using the Estonian Soil Classification (ESC), the peat layer thickness of peaty soils is 10-30 cm and of shallow peat soils, 30-100 cm. The studied peaty soils may be characterized as polygenetic soils. Depending on parent material properties (calcareousness, acidity, texture) and feeding water the peaty soils are divided into two types specified by ESC as peaty gley soils and peaty podzols, and by WRB as Histic Gleysols and Histic Podzols. The mineral soils underlying peat soils may be defined as paleosols. The development of such soils has proceeded according to the chronosequence: gley soils or protosols -> peaty soils -> fen soils -> transitional bog soils -> bog soils, whereas mineral paleosols may be found under fen, transitional bog and bog soils. The peat soils studied in this research work, classified by ESC as drained shallow transitional (mesotrophic) bog soils and by WRB as Drainic Dystric Ombric Hemic Fibric Histosols, are located on the edges of bog areas and are fed mostly by mesotrophic surface seepage water. In comparative analysis of three soil groups (peaty gley soils, peaty podzols and shallow peat soils) (i) their location on the landscape, the geological origin of their parent materials and morphology of the mineral layers are characterized; (ii) the vertical distribution of organic carbon and total nitrogen contents, and different characteristics of soil acidity are analyzed, and (iii) their catenal position or associated soils are characterized. In the case of peaty soils, the three types of mineral soil profiles (eluvial, eluvio-accumulative and accumulative) which underlie the peat cover were elucidated. Under thicker peat layers, i.e. under shallow peat soils, mostly humus accumulative profiles were found. In all analyzed sites, in the course of progressive paludification (among this peatification) the peaty soils have been formed from gley soils. The formation of the peaty soil stage was followed by the fen soil stage. Depending on the feeding water, some of these soils developed in the direction of bog soils, with an intermediary transitional bog stage. Artificial drainage is of great importance in the development of peat cover, which influences first the decomposition of top layer peat. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB Vertical distributions of total N, P, K, Ca and Mg in a 0-60 cm surface peat layer were studied at 80 pine mire sites in southern Finland. The sites fell into two categories according to the soil nutrient regime: Meso-oligotrophic and oligo-ombrotrophic, and formed a chronosequence from undrained sites to sites drained 55 years ago. A statistically significant drainage age effect on the gravimetric (mg g(-1)) concentration profile forms was detected for all nutrients except K. In oligo-ombrotrophic sites the concentration of N increased following drainage in the topmost layer (0-10 cm) and that of P in all layers. In meso-oligotrophic sites the changes in N and P profiles were obscure. The concentration profiles of K remained clearly surface-enriched in both site type groups, but there was a general drop in the concentration values immediately after drainage. Ca and Mg decreased, especially in the 10-20 and 25-35 cm layers in both site type groups. The volumetric (kg m(-3)) nutrient concentrations clearly reflected the increase in the bulk density of the surface peat occurring after drainage. The compaction of peat had compensated for the effect of the processes removing nutrients from the soil (increased tree stand uptake, leaching); for Ca and Mg to a lesser degree than for the other nutrients. It was concluded that the N, P and K profiles did not show changes that would be likely to affect site productivity, whereas the net loss of Ca and Mg may cause problems in the longer term. As the total K capital of the sites was in general rather small, a disturbance in the biological cycle, such as cutting of the tree stand, may be critical.

AB Water draining from the Everglades marshes of southern Florida contains high concentrations of dissolved organic C (DOC), N (DON), and in some locations, P (DOP). These dissolved organic nutrients carry over 90% of the N and organic C, and about 25% of the P exported downstream in the Everglades. Our objectives were to describe the most important aspects of the origin and fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Everglades, and to describe the processes controlling its concentration and export. Concentrations of dissolved organic nutrients are influenced by local plant production, decomposition, and sorption equilibrium with peat. The drained peat soils of the Everglades Agricultural Area and the more productive marshes of the northern Everglades produce some of the highest concentrations of DOC and DON in the Everglades watershed. In portions of the marshes of the northern Everglades, P enrichment was correlated with higher local DOC and DON concentrations and greater production of soluble plant matter. Microbial degradation of Everglades DOM was very slow; less than 10% of the DOC was lost after 6 months of incubation in the laboratory and supplements of inorganic nutrients failed to speed the decomposition. Exposure to solar radiation increased the subsequent decay rate of the remaining DOC (25% in 6 mo.). Solar radiation alone mineralized 20.5% of the DOC, 7% of the DON, and degraded about 50% of the humic substances over 21 days in sterile porewater samples and thus degraded DOM faster than microbial degradation. The humic substances appeared to inhibit biodegradation of the other fractions of the DOC since hydrophilic organic acids decomposed faster when isolated from the humic substances. The fate of DOC and DON is closely linked as indicated by a generally narrow range of C/N ratios. In contrast, high concentrations of DOP were associated with P enrichment (at least in pore water). The DOC was composed of about 50% humic substances, 33% hydrophilic acids, and 15% hydrophilic neutral substances, typical of DOC from other environments, despite the fact that it originates from a neutral to slightly alkaline peatland. Despite high exports of DON (3.9 g m(-2) y(-1) from one area), the marshes of the northern Everglades are a sink for DON on a landscape scale. The agricultural fields of the Everglades Agricultural Area, however, exported net quantities of DON. High concentrations of DOC desorbed from the agricultural soils when water with no DOC was added. Sorption experiments indicated that high concentrations of dissolved organic matter flowing into the marshes from the Everglades Agricultural Area could suppress the further desorption of additional soluble organic matter through physicochemical mechanisms. While biological factors, plant production and microbial decomposition are important in producing potentially soluble organic nutrients, physicochemical sorption equilibria, hydrology, and degradation by solar radiation are also likely to control the export of this material on the landscape scale.

AB Peat and mine drainage treatment sludge can be valorized as amendments on mine sites to stabilize gold mine tailings and reduce the potential leaching of contaminants in pore water. However, the influence of organic amendments on the mobility of metalloids and/or metals in the tailings must be validated, as the leached contaminants may vary according to their type, nature, and origin. The objective of the present study was to evaluate over time the effect of peat-and/or Fe-rich sludge amendments on the mobility of As and metallic cations in the drainage water of tailings potentially producing contaminated neutral drainage. Ten duplicated weathering cell experiments containing tailings alone or amended with peat and/or Fe-rich sludge (5-10% dry weight) were performed and monitored for 112 d. The results showed that as low as 5% peat amendment would promote As mobility in tailings' pore water, with As concentrations exceeding Quebec discharge criteria (> 0.2 mg L-1). In addition, As(III), the most mobile and toxic form, was predominant with 10% peat, whereas organic species were negligible in all cells. The use of peat alone as organic amendment for the stabilization of tailing contaminants could increase the risk of generating As-rich contaminated neutral drainage. Conversely, the mix of only 5% Fe-rich sludge with or without peat decreased As concentrations in leachates by 65 to 80%. Further studies on the use of "peat" or "peat + Fe-rich sludge" as cover or amendment should be conducted with a focus on Fe/As and Ca/As ratios.

AB The effects of wood ash fertilisation on tree nutrition and growth on forested peatlands has been studied using loose ash, but in practice, ash fertilisation is done almost exclusively with granulated ash. In this study, the effects of granulated ash and loose ash (both 5 Mg ha(-1)) on the growth and nutrition of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands were compared between a nitrogen-poor and a nitrogen-rich site over 15 years. On the nitrogen-rich site, wood ash application was also compared with commercial PK fertilisation. On the nitrogen-rich site, mean stand volume growth increase over unfertilised control treatment during the 15 year study period using granulated ash and commercial PK fertiliser was of the same magnitude (on average, 2.2-2.3 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1)). However, when loose ash was used growth increase over control was higher (3.7 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1)). On the nitrogenpoor site, the mean growth increase gained by loose or granulated ash (1.4-1.5 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1)) over the unfertilised control treatment was not significant. Fertilisation with loose ash or PK increased foliar P, K and B concentrations already in the first or second growing season, following fertilisation on both sites. Granulated ash increased foliar P concentrations on the nitrogen-rich site less than loose ash. After an initial increase, foliar P, K and B concentrations decreased at the end of study period. On the nitrogen-poor site. foliar P concentrations were below the deficiency limit by the end of the study period.

SO CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE end restraint; triaxial tests; dilatancy; numerical analyses; peat
ID SHEAR-STRENGTH; BEHAVIOR; MODEL
AB Constitutive models for soils are developed and validated against laboratory tests assuming these give representative information on the true material behaviour. However, data from standard laboratory tests reflect the sample response rather than the true material behaviour, due to nonuniformities in stresses and strains generated over the experimental test. The work examines the implications of end restraint on the definition of the stress-dilatancy rule of highly compressible soils with a finite element numerical approach. The numerical model replicates a reconstituted peat, typically characterized by a combination of high compressibility and high friction angle, which increases the severity of end restraint effects. Simulated results show that the global measurements from standard triaxial tests with rough end platens would not give the proper stress-dilatancy rule, if they were interpreted as the response of a single soil element at the constitutive level. Both overestimation and underestimation of the true dilatancy compared to the material response can be observed, depending on the deformation mode. To support the validity of the numerical results, experimental findings from drained triaxial tests on reconstituted peat are presented. Practical indications are given on how the standard interpretation of drained triaxial tests data on peats can be improved.

AB River water has been sampled under baseflow conditions in both summer and winter at c. 250-m intervals along the length of each of seven rivers in northeast Scotland, and the nitrate contents have been determined. The resultant data have been examined in the context of the nitrogen saturation hypothesis, Capacity of the catchment soils to retain nitrate was generally minimal in winter. Although biological uptake of nitrate was evident in summer, in the upper part of each catchment substantial nitrate leaching still occurred. The phenomenon was most marked in water draining from hill peats, except where these were conspicuously waterlogged. The results are discussed in the context of possible nitrogen saturation effects on upper catchment slopes.

AB Major regime shifts in mires such as the fen-bog transition and the transition from non-forested to forested peatland are driven by ecohydrological changes. However, little is known about how the magnitudes and/or durations of hydrological shifts relate to these regime shifts. Here we analyse long-term water table data in conjunction with plant community data collected from primary mires on the Finnish coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. These ecosystems represent various stages of drainage: undrained, drained sites with developing tree stands, and unsuccessfully drained sites not supporting tree encroachment. The varying success of drainage provides an ideal field laboratory for investigation of thresholds of water table control on the successional trajectories of primary mire. Our data indicate a likely mechanism for the control of vegetation regime shifts in northern peatlands by water table, with time of year being as important a factor as the magnitude of change. Spring flooding rather than summer water table level appeared to be crucial for controlling state shifts in primary mire vegetation. As the effects of climate change on peatlands are most likely to be mediated by changes in hydrology and water table level, our study indicates a need for more thorough investigation of seasonal variability in the controlling factors.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE

DT Article
ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; RESTORATION; LEVEL
AB Bulk density was determined indirectly in peat samples by X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) and compared with density values obtained by standard laboratory methods. Five Histosols were collected in the same cut-over peatland, representing various degrees of disturbance related to the process of peat extraction. Soil cores were fully imaged by X-ray CT with a voxel size of about 0.25 mm. Each one of these five attenuation profiles was analysed and compared with direct density measurements. A linear relationship, to convert attenuation values into density values, is proposed to determine the variation in bulk density with a spatial resolution clearly greater than standard laboratory determinations. It is also shown that X-ray-based density values can be effectively used to characterize the structure of peat soils and the possible consequences of disturbances after drainage and peat mining. Under the accepted limitations of the method, X-ray CT opens up new opportunities to determine the structural quality of peat and to monitor its modifications with time. This indirect diagnostic could be particularly useful to study peatlands' hydraulic systems or evaluate the effectiveness of restoration measures.

AB The growing demand for bioenergy increases pressure on peatlands. The novel strategy of wet peatlands agriculture (paludiculture) may permit the production of bioenergy from biomass while avoiding large greenhouse gas emissions as occur during conventional crop cultivation on drained peat soils. Herein, we present the first greenhouse gas balances of a simulated paludiculture to assess its suitability as a biomass source from a climatic perspective. In a rewetted peatland, we performed closed-chamber measurements of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide exchange in stands of the potential crops Phragmites australis, Typha latifolia, and Carex acutiformis for two consecutive years. To simulate harvest, the biomass of half of the measurement spots was removed once per year. Carbon dioxide exchange was close to neutral in all tested stands. The effect of biomass harvest on the carbon dioxide exchange differed between the 2years. During the first and second year, methane emissions were 13-63gm(-2)a(-1) and 2-5gm(-2)a(-1), respectively. Nitrous oxide emissions lay below our detection limit. Net greenhouse gas balances in the study plots were close to being climate neutral during both years except for the Carex stand, which was a source of greenhouse gases in the first year (in CO2-equivalents: 18 tha(-1)a(-1)). Fifteen years after rewetting the net greenhouse gas balance of the study site was similar to those of pristine fens. In addition, we did not find a significant short-term effect of biomass harvest on net greenhouse gas balances. In our ecosystem, 17 tha(-1)a(-1) of CO2-equivalent emissions are saved by rewetting compared to a drained state. Applying this figure to the fen area in northern Germany, emission savings of 2.8-8.5 Mta(-1) CO2-equivalents could possibly be achieved by rewetting; this excludes additional savings by fossil fuel replacement.

AB Laboratory columns wider continuous flow were packed with peat from the catotelm of an ombrotrophic    bog to simulate the natural environment. Methane concentration increased from 1.4 to 47.8 mumol ml-1 due to anaerobic microbial degradation of the peat, while at the same time the water flow rate decreased from log -1.39 to -3.03 cm3 s-1 and the moisture content decreased from 85.7 to 56.6%. A control column sterilized by irradiation produced carbon dioxide, but, as the flow of water washed this soluble gas out of the column, the hydraulic conductivity and moisture content increased These two results suggest that it is the volume of the gas (in the gas phase within the bog) that controls the hydraulic conductivity of peat bogs. Volume accounting at the end of the experiment showed no gas in rhe sterilized column but 17% gas by volume in the microbially active column. We suggest that as gas bubbles occlude the interstitial pores of the peat the water flow is impeded, reducing both the hydraulic conductivity and the water saturation. The difficulty experienced in draining peat bogs is due to this occlusion, which is also responsible for the heightened water table found in raised bogs. Although methane is produced in bogs, only very low levels of methane emission have been reported Thus the methane released from northern areas will only significantly contribute to increasing radiative gases in the atmosphere if the bogs themselves are disturbed, for example by mining, when the entrapped methane is released, the water table falls, and the bog dries out.

AB The hydrology of a cutover fen was studied from May to October in 1995 and 1996. Rainfall equivalent depths were measured every 15 min and stream runoff was continuously monitored. Water table depths were measured bi-weekly during 1995 and continuously during 1996. Storm runoff was separated into different components; rain falling directly into channels and rapid groundwater response based on a contributing area method and on different electrical conductivities of rain-, ground- and streamwater. The results show three sources of storm runoff from cutover fens. Frequent small runoff peaks were caused by rain falling directly into channels. The amount of quick runoff increased when rain fell on wet soil, resulting in intermediate sized runoff peaks generated by rapid groundwater response. The largest runoff values were observed after prolonged rainfall when water from the upper part of the catchment flooded the fen. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Laccases of fungal origin have been intensively studied due to their importance in various biotechnological applications. There is a constant demand for new laccases with improved properties such as stability at higher temperatures or at an alkaline pH. Growing molecular evidence suggests that laccases may also be widespread in bacteria. While only a handful of bacterial laccases have been purified and characterized, several novel traits have already been discovered (e.g. pH-stability and 2-domain organization of the enzyme as opposed to the usual 3-domain structure of fungal laccases). The aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial laccase-like genes in two types of high-organic peat soil using a cloning and sequencing approach. Gene libraries prepared of small fragments (150 base pairs) revealed an amazing diversity of bacterial laccases. The fragments clustered in 11 major lineages, and one third of the 241 sequences resembled laccase-like genes of Acidobacreria. Additionally, a new primer was used to retrieve several larger fragments of the putative bacterial laccase genes that spanned all four copper-binding sites. Both "conventional" 3-domain laccases and the recently described 2-domain small laccascs have been obtained using this approach, demonstrating the potential of the primer. The present study thus contributes to the understanding of the diversity of bacterial laccases and provides a new tool for finding laccase-like sequences in bacterial strains and soil samples.

ID EVENTS
AB The reconstruction of environmental changes in the southeast of Belarus during the last 14700 cal. BP is based on the results of palynological, radiocarbon, isotope and lithological studies of Lake Staroje deposits. Climatic fluctuations, fires and human activities played a significant role in the transformation of the vegetation cover. The beginning of the lacustrine sedimentation was dated circa 16000 cal. BP. The intensification of erosion processes on the water catchment area was marked by an increase in the mineral material flow into the lake. These events have a positive correlation with the climate cooling and humidity phases in the Late Glacial and Early Holocene, and in the Late Holocene with anthropogenic impact stages. The traces of the episodic human activity were dated to 5800 cal. BP, while the expansion of farming and pasturing areas began at 3000 cal. BP. Currently the consequences of human activities (including drainage of bogs) are reflected in the treeless landscapes adjacent to the lake.

AB In this review, technical and economically viable potentials for carbon sequestration in the agricultural soils of Europe by 2008-2012 are analysed against a business-as-usual scenario. We provide a quantitative estimation of the carbon absorption potential per hectare and the surface of agricultural land that is available and suitable for the implementation of those measures, their environmental effects as well as the effects on farm income. Realistically, agricultural soils in EU-15 can sequester up to 16-19 Mt C year(-1) during the first Kyoto commitment period (2008-2012), which is less than one fifth of the theoretical potential and equivalent to 2% of European anthropogenic emissions. We identified as most promising measures: the promotion of organic inputs on arable land instead of grassland, the introduction of perennials (grasses, trees) on arable set-aside land for conservation or biofuel purposes, to promote organic farming, to raise the water table in fanned peatland, and-with restrictions-zero tillage or conservation tillage. Many options have environmental benefits but some risk of increasing N2O emissions. For most measures it is impossible to determine the overall impact on farm profitability. Efficient carbon sequestration in agricultural soils demands a permanent management change and implementation concepts adjusted to local soil, climate and management features in order to allow selection of areas with high carbon sequestering potential. Some of the present agricultural policy schemes have probably helped to maintain carbon stocks in agricultural soils. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Boreal peatlands are an important carbon (C) sink. The effect of drainage for forestry on the soil C balance in those peatlands is a controversial debate. The Lakkasuo peatland, central Finland, comprise a minerotrophic and an ombrotrophic part, both partially drained for forestry. A pair-wise comparison was conducted and four different profile-based methods were applied to calculate the soil C balance. The first two methods used differences in ash content (I) between the upper and lower part of the profile and (II) between the drained and natural site of the peatland, respectively. The third method (III) used radiocarbon dated samples to calculate C accumulation rates at the natural site and compared these to the current C-stocks at the drained sites. The fourth method (IV) used radiocarbon dated samples to define a 1000-year layer in the profiles for comparing the C-stocks above this layer. Stable carbon isotope depth profiles, used for a qualitative assessment of the peatland status, identify both undrained site as undisturbed. All four methods indicate a C loss at the minerotrophic drained site but of different magnitude (0.057-0.272 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). At the ombrotrophic drained site both radiocarbon methods (III and IV) indicate a C gain (0.139-0.179 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) whereas methods I and II suggest a C loss (0.084-0.270 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). Method IV is considered the most stringent and robust one. Yet, the comparison of profile-based methods for C balance assessment suggests them to be applicable depending on site specific conditions of nutrient status and presence of a natural reference site.

AB Land-use change is known to be a major threat to biodiversity and ecosystem services in Mediterranean areas. However, the potential for different host plants to modulate the effect of land-use intensification on community composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is still poorly understood. To test the hypothesis that low land-use intensity promotes AMF diversity at different taxonomic scales and to determine whether any response is dependent upon host plant species identity, we characterised AMF communities in the roots of 10 plant species across four land use types of differing intensity in a Mediterranean peatland system. AMF were identified using 454 pyrosequencing. This revealed an overall low level of AMF richness in the peaty soils; lowest AMF richness in the intense cropping system at both virtual taxa and family level; strong modulation by the host plant of the impact of land-use intensification on AMF communities at the virtual taxa level; and a significant effect of land-use intensification on AMF communities at the family level. These findings have implications for understanding ecosystem stability and productivity and should be considered when developing soil-improvement strategies in fragile ecosystems, such as Mediterranean peatlands.

AB Watering up typically ensues after clearcutting forestry-drained peatland forests. Thus, the effectiveness of maintenance drainage and soil preparation procedures becomes paramount for establishing a new generation of commercial forest. Mounding is the primary method of soil preparation applied in regeneration sites lying on deep peat. As raised planting spots, mounds are resistant to waterlogging and assumed to be beneficial for organic matter (OM) decomposition via, e.g., increased soil aeration and temperature, which would also enhance seedling growth. In recent years, however, less intensive and cheaper alternatives like scalping have been sought with some reported cases of success. Our case study investigated the survival and growth of Scots pine outplants in mounds, scalps, and unprepared microsites along a moisture gradient. After three growing seasons, mounding accelerated neither seedling growth nor OM decomposition relative to the unprepared treatment. Survival in mounds was nonetheless superior overall. Scalps behaved as water collecting depressions leading to a catastrophic regeneration result. Based on our findings, water table level (WTL) overrides other growth-controlling factors in excess moisture conditions. To combat watering up coupled with greater than normal rainfall, we recommend reforestation strategies which provide elevated, prepared planting spots (i.e., mounds) or utilize unprepared, higher microforms.

AB Peat bogs are among the most threatened habitats in Central Europe. They are characterized by stagnant water with low pH and lower nutrient content compared to the surrounding habitats. The flora and fauna of peat bogs comprised of many habitat specialist and rare species. We explored the differences in spider fauna of European spruce and Scots pine forests. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of microhabitat diversity in the bog forests of the Poiana Stampei peat bog complex, Bucovina, Romania. We collected numerous rare and cold-adapted species. .We found a strong effect of forest type, presumably due to the different microclimatic conditions of the forests. European spruce forests had lower species richness of ground-dwelling fauna than Scots pine forests; however, we found contradictory results for vegetation-dwelling species richness. Hummocks had a more positive effect on the ground-dwelling spiders of Scots pine than in European spruce forests, presumably due to the more open structure of sphagnum hummocks than ground level. However, this effect was negative for vegetation dwellers. The cold-adapted species with restricted ranges are vulnerable to climate change, and bogs may serve as important micro-refugia for them. Central European bogs are isolated and highly threatened by anthropogenic activities, such as drainage, peat extraction, and eutrophication. The deterioration habitat quality of peat bogs will result in a significant loss in the regional species pool of the Carpathians.

AB Rewetting combined with biomass crop cultivation (paludiculture) has been proposed as a method for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from drained peatlands. This field experiment compared CO2 fluxes from drained (control) and rewetted experimental plots in a temperate fen under reed canary grass cultivation over two successive years. The annual weighted mean water table depth from soil surface (WTD) during the study period was 9, 3 and 1 cm in control, semi-flooded and flooded plots, respectively. There were no significant effects of WTD treatment on biomass yields. The choice of response model for CO2 fluxes influenced annual estimates of ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary production (GPP), but all models showed that ER and GPP decreased in response to rewetting. The resulting net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2, derived by combining eight ER and eight GPP models, varied widely. For example, NEE (expressed as CO2-C) ranged from -935 to -208 g m(-2) yr(-1) for the flooded plots. One set of ER and GPP models was selected on the basis of statistical criteria and showed insignificant differences in NEE between the three water table treatments (-537 to -341 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)). Treatment effects on CO2 emission factors, calculated as the sum of NEE and C export in harvested biomass (58-242 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)), were similarly insignificant. Thus, the results indicated that varying WTD within this narrow range could influence both ER and GPP without altering the net emissions of CO2.

AB A series of laboratory-based incubations using a stable isotope tracer technique was applied to measure the net and gross fluxes of CH3Cl and CH3Br as well as the net fluxes of CHCl3 from surface soils of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California. Annually averaged flux measurements show that these mineral/oxidized peat soils are a net source of CH3Cl (140 +/- 266 nmol m(-2) d(-1)) and CHCl3 (258 +/- 288 nmol m(-2) d(-1)), and a net sink of CH3Br (-2.3 +/- 4.5 nmol m(-2) d(-1)). Gross CH3Cl and CH3Br fluxes are strongly influenced by both soil moisture and temperature: gross production rates of CH3Cl and CH3Br are linearly correlated with temperature, whereas gross consumption rates exhibit Gaussian relationships with maximum consumption at soil moisture levels between 20 and 30% volumetric water content (VWC) and a temperature range of 25 to 35 degrees C. Although soil moisture and soil temperature strongly affect consumption rates, the range of gross consumption rates overall is limited (-506 +/- 176 nmol m(-2) d(-1) for CH3Cl and -12 +/- 4 nmol m(-2) d(-1) for CH3Br) and is similar to rates reported in previous studies. CHCl3 fluxes are not correlated with methyl halide fluxes, temperature, or soil moisture. The annual emission rates of CHCl3 from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta are found to be a potentially significant local source of this compound.

AB Peatland restoration by inundation of drained areas can alter local greenhouse gas emissions as CO2 and CH4. Factors that can influence these emissions include the quality and amount of substrates available for anaerobic degradation processes and the sources and availability of electron acceptors. In order to learn about possible sources of high CO2 and CH4 emissions from a rewetted degraded fen grassland, we performed incubation experiments that tested the effects of fresh plant litter in the flooded peats on pore water chemistry and CO2 and CH4 production and emission.
   The position in the soil profile of the pre-existing drained peat substrate affected initial rates of anaerobic CO2 production subsequent to flooding, with the uppermost peat layer producing the greatest specific rates of CO2 evolution. CH4 production rates depended on the availability of electron acceptors and was significant only when sulfate concentrations were reduced in the pore waters. Very high specific rates of both CO2 (maximum of 412 mg Cd-1 kg(-1) C) and CH4 production (788 mg Cd-1 kg(-1) C) were observed in a new sediment layer that accumulated over the 2.5 years since the site was flooded. This new sediment layer was characterized by overall low C content, but represented a mixture of sand and relatively easily decomposable plant litter from reed canary grass killed by flooding. Samples that excluded this new sediment layer but included intact roots remaining from flooded grasses had specific rates of CO2 (max. 28 mg Cd-1 kg(-1) C) and CH4 (max. 34 mg Cd-1 kg(-1) C) production that were 10-20 times lower than for the new sediment layer and were comparable to those of a newly flooded upper peat layer. Lowest rates of anaerobic CO2 and CH4 production (range of 4-8 mg Cd-1 kg(-1) C and <1 mg C d(-1) kg(-1) C) were observed when all fresh organic matter sources (plant litter and roots) were excluded. In conclusion, the presence of fresh organic substrates such as plant and root litter originating from plants killed by inundation has a high potential for CH4 production, whereas peat without any fresh plant-derived material is relatively inert. Significant anaerobic CO2 and CH4 production in peat only occurs when some labile organic matter is available, e.g. from remaining roots or root exudates.

ID GREAT-BRITAIN; PEAT
AB The vegetation, physical characteristics and conservation value of mires (peatlands) within Kielder Forest, northern England, are described. A review of the options available for their conservation management examines the effects of changes in the water table, the impact of grazing livestock and changes brought about by neighbouring conifer plantations.
   These raised and blanket mires vary in size from 0.6 to 69.6 ha, and are dominated by ombrotrophic vegetation. Their main conservation value lies in their 'naturalness', which arises from the extensive nature of locally used stock grazing systems and the intrinsic difficulty of draining mires that lie in depressions and experience an upland climate. Such sites are rare and contain uncommon plants and invertebrates, whilst collectively these mires exhibit considerable topographical and hydrological variety,
   A review of the hydrological effects of conifer plantations on mire catchments concludes that the catchments probably have little, if any, influence on the mires themselves. Management of water flow on the mires has the objective of reducing the rate of discharge of precipitation from them by damming agricultural and forestry drainage channels.
   A review of the role of livestock grazing concludes that there is no direct evidence to suggest that this is required to maintain the mire plant communities. Circumstantial evidence suggests that its impact is minimal on vegetation over deep peat, and probably most influential on vegetation over shallower peat at mire margins.

AB . A map of the potential natural vegetation of Ireland with an outline description of the vegetation units is presented. The vegetation of Ireland has a distinctive and highly oceanic character as a result of its location on the northwestern extremity of the Eurasian landmass and its recent geological and vegetation history. Forests would naturally cover the greater part of the island but the long history of forest decline over the last 6000 yr, due to clearance by man and paludification, has led to the present situation where native forest cover is less than 1 % of the land area. Together with intensive land use, drainage, peat cutting and the introduction of alien species, this presents considerable difficulties in the construction of mapping units. The map, which has been compiled as part of the Vegetation Map of Europe at a scale of 1 : 2.5 million, contains 20 mapping units. They comprise: nine forests, i.e. montane birch forests (one unit), acidophilous oak forests (two units), forests of oak or oak and ash with hazel on mostly base-rich soils (four units), forests on alluvium and gleyed clays (one unit each); five mire types, i.e. blanket mires (two units), raised bogs (one unit), sedge mires (one unit), degraded raised bogs (one unit); and six minor units viz. heaths (two units), sand dunes (two units), salt marshes (one unit) and polders (one unit). As a result of human activity, the potential natural vegetation, especially the forests, will differ considerably from the former natural climax vegetation.

The canopy coverages and species number for peatland forests were also compared with those for mineral soil forests on the permanent sample plots (n= 1725) in 1995.
   In general, effective temperature sum correlated positively, although not very strongly, with the coverages and species number in most of the canopy layers, as well as with the mean range of the diameter distribution. The effects of both site quality class and drainage phase were stronger on pine mires than on spruce mires, most probably due to the longer fertility gradient and large potential free growing space in the former group. On pine mires, drainage increased the abundances and species number in the different canopy layers, as well as the structural inequality of the tree stands. On spruce mires, the increase was principally allocated to the abundances of the dominant and intermediate tree layers. The correlations between the total crown coverage of the tree layers and stand basal area were r= 0.45 for spruce mires and r=0.70 for pine mires. Compared to mineral soil forests, in addition to having a higher abundance of Betulapubescens, the dominant layer was not as pronounced in peatland forests. On spruce mires, the coverage of the shrub layer on mesotrophic and meso-oligotrophic sites was higher than that in mineral soil forests. The average species number in different canopy layers did not differ significantly between spruce mires and mineral soil forests in corresponding site quality classes. On pine mires, the species number was generally lower (except for the mesotrophic sites) than that in corresponding mineral soil forests.

AB A substantial amount of below-ground carbon (C) is suggested to be associated with fungi, which may significantly affect the soil C balance in forested ecosystems. Ergosterol from in-growth mesh bags and litterbags was used to estimate fungal biomass production and community composition in drained peatland forests with differing fertility. Extramatrical mycelia (EMM) biomass production was generally higher in the nutrient-poor site, increased with deeper water table level and decreased along the length of the recovery time. EMM biomass production was of the same magnitude as in mineral-soil forests. Saprotrophic fungal biomass production was higher in the nutrient-rich site. Both ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and saprotrophic fungal community composition changed according to site fertility and water table level. ECM fungal community composition with different exploration types may explain the differences in fungal biomass production between peatland forests. Melanin-rich Hyaloscypha may indicate decreased turnover of biomass in nutrient-rich young peatland forest. Genera Lactarius and Laccaria may be important in nutrient rich and Piloderma in the nutrient-poor conditions, respectively. Furthermore, Paxillus involutus and Cortinarius sp. may be important generalists in all sites and responsible for EMM biomass production during the first summer months. Saprotrophs showed a functionally more diverse fungal community in the nutrient-rich site.

AB The mineralogy of three back-barrier peat marshes (Torreblanca, Benicasim and Moncofar marshes) from Eastern Spain and one peat bog (Orihuela del Tremedal bog) from central east Spain have been investigated, using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electronic microscope (SEM) techniques. A combination of XRD methods was used to quantify the mineralogy of dried bulk peat samples.
   The water source in the peat marshes is both continental and marine. Water is highly mineralised. Water flow is both low and slow (accumulative system). The water source in the peat bog is continental, draining from the hill. The higher concentration of ions in the water of the back-barrier peat marshes leads to a higher concentration of authigenic minerals in the peat marshes compared to the peat bog.
   Three main mineral origins have been recognized, namely: detrital, syngenetic-epigenetic and biogenic. The more important contribution comes from the detrital system.
   Biogenic and bio-influenced minerals are the main non-detrital minerals in the peatlands. This paper discusses the biogenic origin of halite (and other minor halides and sulphates, such as, sylvite, carnalite, epsomite, glauberite, mirabilite and anhydrite?) from halophytic plants, as well as amorphous silica (opal-A) from sponge spicules and phytoliths of several plants.
   Pyrite in the peat bog has both syngenetic and epigenetic origins from plant decomposition and sulphur release. In the peat marsh the pyrite has a syngenetic origin from sulphate reduction (S-sulphate -> S-pyritic and an epigenetic origin in the older peat, from plant decomposition (S-organic -> S-pyritic).

AB The EU Landfill Directive obliges member states to collect and treat leachate from landfill sites. In regions of high population density, this is commonly achieved through discharge of the leachate to the municipal sewerage system. In Ireland, rural landfills can be a long distance from a suitable sewerage system, resulting in high transportation costs. On-site treatment systems, when used elsewhere, are mainly aerobic treatment systems, which are costly to construct and operate. There is a particular need for low-cost, low-maintenance leachate treatment systems for small low-income landfills, and for closed landfills, where long-term running costs of aerobic systems may be unsustainable. In 1989, this research work was initiated to investigate the use of local peat for the treatment of leachate from a small rural landfill site. In 1997, following the award of grant-aid under the EU LIFE Programme, a full-scale leachate treatment plant was constructed, using local un-drained peat as the treatment medium. When the LIFE Project ended in February 2001, leachate treatment research continued at the site using a,pre-treated peat as the treatment medium. The treatment levels achieved using both types of peat are discussed in this paper. It is concluded that landfill leachate may be successfully treated using a low-cost peat bed to achieve almost 100% removal of both BOD and ammonia. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Emissions of CH(4), N(2)O, and CO(2) from soils are the result of a number of biological and physical processes, each influenced by several environmental and management factors exhibiting spatial variability. This study aimed to assess the spatial variability and spatial dependence of CH(4), N(2)O, and CO(2) emissions and their underlying soil processes and properties from grasslands on drained peat soil (Terric Histosol). Emissions and possible controlling factors were measured at a field location in Sweden. Measurements were done on two adjacent sites on peat soil on two successive days for each site. Spatial variability was analyzed with trend analysis and variograms. Both sites consumed small amounts of atmospheric CH(4), i.e., 0.03 and 0.05 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1), and emitted N(2)O and CO(2), i.e., 5 to 19 mg N(2)O m(-2) d(-1) and 4 to 6 g CO(2) m(-2) d(-1). Spatial variability of emissions was high, with coefficients of variation of 50 to 1400%. Emissions either showed a spatial trend or were spatially dependent with ranges of spatial dependence of 50 to >200 m. However, spatial dependence of emissions showed differences between sites and short-term temporal variability. Variograms of emissions and soil processes, which are partly biological in nature and have a high degree of inherent variability, should be interpreted with care.

AB Drained agricultural peat soils are significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) but also small sinks for methane (CH4). Leaving these soils without any cultivation practice could be an option to mitigate GHG emissions. To test this hypothesis, we measured, over a three year period, net CO2 exchange and fluxes of CH4 for five agricultural peat soils that had been abandoned for 20-30 years. Annually, the sites were either small net sinks or sources of CO2 and CH4 (-7.8 to 530 g CO2-C m(-2) and -0.41 to 1.8 g CH4 m(-2)). Including N2O emissions from our previous study, the net (CH4 + CO2 + N2O) emissions as CO2 equivalents were lower than in cultivated peat soils and were lowest in the wet year. Therefore, high GHG emissions from these soils could be avoided if the water table is maintained close to the soil surface when photosynthesis is favoured over respiration.

AB A rapidly growing human population and the extirpation of numerous species make modern wetlands among the most threatened of ecosystems. One of the endangered wetland plants in central and eastern Europe is Betula humilis. B. humilis forms comparably abundant populations on both well-preserved and drained fens; thus, we aimed in this paper to investigate the relationships between habitat quality parameters (e.g. concentrations of calcium and magnesium, groundwater levels, pH and conductivity) and genetic diversity in 12 populations of B. humilis from Poland, Belarus and Latvia. For the purposes of this study, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) gene sequences and nuclear microsatellites were chosen as molecular markers. Analyses revealed that only the Ca2+ concentration was significantly negative relative to the observed heterozygosity of microsatellites, which suggests that calcium access is the only factor influencing genetic variation at B. humilis localities. No genetic differentiation was detected between populations occupying wet and dry habitats in different parts of the species range. A minimum spanning tree based on ADH gene haplotypes appears to confirm the B. humilis population history previously inferred from analyses of nuclear microsatellites and chloroplast markers.

AB Arctic regions contain large amounts of stored soil carbon and comprise huge areas of discontinuous vegetation. The potential for feedback effects on possible changing climatic conditions through altered source/sink action for atmospheric CO2 is therefore an important issue in tundra regions. In this, study we investigate environmental controls on CO2 evolution rates in Arctic soils through observations along a Eurasian transect of tundra sites and comparative experiments in northern Sweden and northeast Greenland. Among factors potentially controlling decomposition rates in Eurasian wet and mesic tundra temperature and depth of the water table significantly influenced the CO2 efflux, while thaw depth, soil nitrogen, and organic matter concentrations explained very little of the variation in fluxes. The minor importance of the soil N status in controlling decomposition rates was confirmed in experiments in which N and P was added in a factorial manner at a subarctic heath and a high-Arctic drained fen. Phosphorus decreased the CO2 emissions, while the combined N and P treatment increased the emissions in the subarctic. These effects were not reproduced in the high Arctic. The results support most assumptions in current decomposition models on the soil climatic controls on decomposition rates in the Arctic.

This paper addresses managing reed-dominated (Phragmites australis) vegetation stands with special-purpose tracked machinery in central Europe. Three options of biomass harvest for energetic and material use were investigated. Contribution margin accounting estimated the income left after subtracting variable costs and fixed machinery costs. Stochastic scenario analysis (Monte Carlo method) revealed a wide range of possible outcomes from ca. epsilon -1000 to epsilon 1500 ha(-1) yr(-1). Harvesting summer reed for biogas production is the least profitable option, winter mowing for direct combustion can be cost-efficient, and reed for thatchingis clearly the most profitable. Cumulative probability distributions identified risks of 98%, 18%, and <1% respectively, that revenues for biomass cannot cover harvesting costs. The feasibility and competitiveness of the three harvesting regimes are principally influenced by the availability of mature technology, legal restrictions, the entitlement to agricultural subsidies, a remuneration of external benefits, and the opportunity costs of present farming activities. Therefore, laws and policies determine whether a balanced provision of ecosystem services is hindered or promoted in peatlands used for agriculture. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrologic transport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from peat soils may differ to organo-mineral soils in how they responded to changes in flow, because of differences in soil profile and hydrology. In well-drained organo-mineral soils, low flow is through the lower mineral layer where DOC is absorbed and high flow is through the upper organic layer where DOC is produced. DOC concentrations in streams draining organo-mineral soils typically increase with flow. in saturated peat soils, both high and low flows are through an organic layer where DOC is produced. Therefore, DOC in stream water draining peat may not increase in response to changes in flow as there is no switch in flow path between a mineral and organic layer. To verify this, we conducted a high-resolution monitoring study of soil and stream water at an upland peat catchment in northern England. Our data showed a strong positive correlation between DOC concentrations at -1 and -5 cm depth and stream water, and weaker correlations between concentrations at -20 to -50 cm depth and stream water. Although near surface organic material appears to be the key source of stream water DOC in both peat and organo-mineral soils, we observed a negative correlation between stream flow and DOC concentrations instead of a positive correlation as DOC released from organic layers during low and high flow was diluted by rainfall. The differences in DOC transport processes between peat and organo-mineral soils have different implications for our understanding of long-term changes in DOC exports. While increased rainfall may cause an increase in DOC flux from peat due to an increase in water volume, it may cause a decrease in concentrations. This response is contrary to expected changes in DOC exports from organo-mineral soils, where increase rainfall is likely to result in an increase in flux and concentration. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Precommercial thinning is a silvicultural treatment commonly used to reduce the number of stems in densely regenerated stands. When applied to organic or mineral wetland sites, this treatment drastically eliminates a great portion of the canopy, which is responsible for maintaining evapotranspiration processes. The water table is susceptible, therefore, to rise in those sites where evapotranspiration is a significant regulator of the hydrological balance. The objective of this study was to investigate and quantify water table rise after precommercial thinning on post-harvest, drained forested wetlands, and to relate this rise to factors influencing evapotranspiration processes. The water table rose after precommercial thinning regardless of soil type, the distance to the drainage ditch, or the year of observation. In the second year after thinning on mineral soils, canopy openings were invaded by abundant and vigorous ground vegetation. Water table rise was significantly lower at that time than for the preceding year, indicating a tendency for faster hydrological recovery on mineral soil sites. The water table rise was related to the basal area removed, indicating the importance of woody vegetation in regulating water table depth in forested wetlands. Seasonal patterns in water table depth further illustrated the role of vegetation in the hydrological balance of such sites. Light to moderate thinning practices, therefore, appeared to be the most appropriate recommendation to avoid watering-up in young forested wetland stands. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatland forests constitute a significant timber resource in several boreal countries. In Finland, peatlands have been intensively managed with large-scale drainage operations to enhance growth of the stands. In comparison with forests on mineral soils, a divergent feature in the management of peatland stands is the ditch network maintenance. We investigated the optimal forest management schedules for peatland stands using data from 17 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sample stands representing the most important drained peatland site type in two climatic regions in northern Finland. We used the PIKAIA optimisation procedure (a genetic algorithm) to maximise the net present value of alternative management schedules involving ditch network maintenance operations and thinnings. Recent price and cost data were applied in the analyses. We found that the higher the interest rate, (i) the shorter the present generation's rotation period and (ii) the less silvicultural activities were involved in the management schedule. Harsh climatic conditions emphasised this result, also showing that a decrease in the mean annual increment may lead to a significant increase in net present value. For each individual stand, the optimal stand management clearly outperformed (with respect to financial outcome) reference management that was mainly based on prevailing silvicultural recommendations. The results highlight the importance of interest rates in financial analyses of forestry: it is not self-evident that optimal stand management would include several silvicultural activities, such as ditch network maintenance and thinnings.

AB The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export from land to ocean via rivers is a significant term in the global C cycle, and has been modified in many areas by human activity. DOC exports from large global rivers are fairly well quantified, but those from smaller river systems, including those draining oceanic regions, are generally under-represented in global syntheses. Given that these regions typically have high runoff and high peat cover, they may exert a disproportionate influence on the global land-ocean DOC export. Here we describe a comprehensive new assessment of the annual riverine DOC export to estuaries across the island of Great Britain (GB), which spans the latitude range 50-60 degrees N with strong spatial gradients of topography, soils, rainfall, land use and population density. DOC yields (export per unit area) were positively related to and best predicted by rainfall, peat extent and forest cover, but relatively insensitive to population density or agricultural development. Based on an empirical relationship with land use and rainfall we estimate that the DOC export from the GB land area to the freshwater-seawater interface was 1.15 Tg C year(-1) in 2017. The average yield for GB rivers is 5.04 g C m(-2) year(-1), higher than most of the world's major rivers, including those of the humid tropics and Arctic, supporting the conclusion that under-representation of smaller river systems draining peat-rich areas could lead to under-estimation of the global land-ocean DOC export. The main anthropogenic factor influencing the spatial distribution of GB DOC exports appears to be upland conifer plantation forestry, which is estimated to have raised the overall DOC export by 0.168 Tg C year(-1). This is equivalent to 15% of the estimated current rate of net CO2 uptake by British forests. With the UK and many other countries seeking to expand plantation forest cover for climate change mitigation, this 'leak in the ecosystem' should be incorporated in future assessments of the CO2 sequestration potential of forest planting strategies.

AB Rewetting can effectively reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from drained peatlands. Reliable emissions estimation approaches are needed for accounting of such reductions and for evaluating the potential in terms of carbon credits. Annual mean water level and vegetation are reliable and widely used proxies for emissions estimation. However, indications of water level based on plant species (e.g. Ellenberg Indicator Values) are qualitative with large variances, and there are insufficient high-quality flux measurement data to support the direct use of vegetation as a proxy for GHG fluxes. Here we combine vegetation and water level proxies to estimate emissions, by using bioindication of vegetation communities for water level together with the linear correlation between annual mean water level and GHG fluxes. This approach is demonstrated in the Drentsche Aa brook valley in The Netherlands, where peatlands were rewetted to restore rich fen vegetation. Biodiversity of the landscape was monitored by repeated vegetation mapping before and after rewetting, which enables the estimation of emissions reduction as a co-benefit. Mean annual water level values are assigned to mapped vegetation types using existing data on water level dynamics from measurements on corresponding plant communities. GHG emissions are estimated using linear regression models of gas fluxes against mean annual water levels. This approach provides spatially explicit and quantitative estimation of mean annual water levels and GHG fluxes. When combined with information on spatial patterns and variances, the resulting estimations can promote recognition of the carbon co-benefits of biodiversity restoration while facilitating more site-specific optimisation of management practices.

AB Natural soil pipes, which have been widely reported in peatlands, have been shown to contribute significantly to total stream flow. Here, using measurements from eight pipe outlets, we consider the role of natural pipes in the transport of fluvial carbon within a 17.4-ha blanket-peat-covered catchment. Concentrations of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) from pipe waters varied greatly between pipes and over time, ranging between 5.3 and 180.6 mg L-1 for DOC and 0.08 and 220 mg L-1 for POC. Pipes were important pathways for peatland fluvial carbon export, with fluxes varying between 0.6 and 67.8 kg yr(-1) (DOC) and 0.1 and 14.4 kg yr(-1) (POC) for individual pipes. Pipe DOC flux was equivalent to 20% of the annual DOC flux from the stream outlet while the POC flux from pipes was equivalent to 56% of the annual stream POC flux. The proportion of different forms of aquatic carbon to total aquatic carbon flux varied between pipes, with DOC ranging between 80.0% and 91.2%, POC from 3.6% to 17.1%, dissolved CO2-C from 2.4% to 11.1% and dissolved CH4-C from 0.004% to 1.3%. The total flux of dissolved CO2-C and CH4-C scaled up to all pipe outlets in the study catchment was estimated to be 89.4 and 3.6 kg yr(-1) respectively. Overall, pipe outlets produced discharge equivalent to 14% of the discharge in the stream but delivered an amount of aquatic carbon equivalent to 22% of the aquatic carbon flux at the catchment outlet. Pipe densities in blanket peatlands are known to increase when peat is affected by drainage or drying. Hence, environmental change in many peatlands may lead to an increase in aquatic carbon fluxes from natural pipes, thereby influencing the peatland carbon balance and downstream ecological processes.

AB In Finland, recycling of wood-ash as a fertilizer has been widely studied in recent decades in peatlands drained for forestry. Wood-ash is reported to promote tree growth without any significant negative impacts on the environment and could, therefore, be a suitable option on cut-away peatlands, which are estimated to increase by 30,000 ha over the next ten years. However, the environmental effects of ash-fertilization on cut-away peatlands or on ground vegetation are not well known. We studied the effects of wood- and peat-ash application on the nutrient content in soil and plants and on the heavy metal content in the vegetation of a cut-away peatland. Six treatments of different quantities and mixtures of wood-ash, peat-ash, biotite, or Forest PK-fertilizer were replicated in three plots. Both wood- and peat-ash fertilization ensured an adequate level of nutrients for the early establishment and growth of ground vegetation and birch seedlings in a cut-away peatland. Dense pioneer moss cover was important in trapping the heavy metals, such as cadmium, which are present in the ash. Ground vegetation of mosses and herbaceous plants also had a major role in the retention of the nutrients that could otherwise have leached from the open cut-away peatland area during the early stages of afforestation. Both wood- and peat-ash proved to be suitable for the initial fertilization of afforested cut-away peatlands, but in order to guarantee a sufficient long-term potassium supply for tree growth, an application of biotite with the peat-ash is recommended.

AB Drainage and peat harvesting may induce considerable changes in the fluxes to the atmosphere of the greenhouse gases CH4 and CO2 in peatlands. In this study, fluxes of CH4 and CO2 were measured with the closed chamber method in 6 Swedish peatlands that are being mined. Fluxes of CH4 were much higher from ditches than from mining "strips", i.e. emissions from ditches dominated in most peatlands. The total CH4 emission during the growing season (0.41 to 4.5 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)) was similar to emissions from virgin peatlands. Emissions from ditches can probably be kept low by keeping the ditches clear from vegetation. Like CH4, CO2 was released to the atmosphere from both ditches and strips in most peatlands. The total emission during the growing season (0.23 to 1.0 kg CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)) was strongly dominated by the strips. Compared to the total peat yield during mining these CO2 emission rates imply that on average ca 6% of the peat carbon is lost by microbial decomposition in the mire.

AB Models were developed for predicting the proportion of latewood, wood density, tracheid length, tracheid width, and the ratio of cell wall thickness to tracheid width in individual annual rings of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). The models needed to be applicable as a part of a stand growth simulation system, which is based on growth models at the tree level. Data were collected from long-term thinning, thinning-fertilisation, and precommercial thinning experiments on mineral soil and drained peatland in southern and central Finland. The wood and tracheid properties were related to radial increment rate and distance from the pith outwards. An increased increment rate, caused by the different treatments and environmental conditions, resulted in similar types of changes in the wood and tracheid properties irrespective of the factors promoting radial increment. Although most of the average values of the properties were predicted unbiased, there were large random variations between individual trees and annual rings. The fixed parts of the models accounted for the following percentages of the variation: latewood proportion, 42%, wood density, 35%, tracheid length, 84%, tracheid width, 44%, and cell wall percentage, 29%. Incorporating the models for wood and tracheid properties into forest management planning systems enables estimates for the conversion of different silvicultural regimes into internal stem structure and wood quality.

AB Although northern peatlands cover only 3% of the land surface, their thick peat deposits contain an estimated one-third of the world's soil organic carbon (SOC). Under a changing climate the potential of peatlands to continue sequestering carbon is unknown. This paper presents an analysis of 6 years of total carbon balance of an almost intact Atlantic blanket bog in Glencar, County Kerry, Ireland. The three components of the measured carbon balance were: the land-atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) and the flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exported in a stream draining the peatland. The 6 years C balance was computed from 6 years (2003-2008) of measurements of meteorological and eddy-covariance CO2 fluxes, periodic chamber measurements of CH4 fluxes over 3.5 years, and 2 years of continuous DOC flux measurements. Over the 6 years, the mean annual carbon was -29.7 +/- 30.6 (+/- 1 SD) g C m-2 yr-1 with its components as follows: carbon in CO2 was a sink of -47.8 +/- 30.0 g C m-2 yr-1; carbon in CH4 was a source of 4.1 +/- 0.5 g C m-2 yr-1 and the carbon exported as stream DOC was a source of 14.0 +/- 1.6 g C m-2 yr-1. For 2 out of the 6 years, the site was a source of carbon with the sum of CH4 and DOC flux exceeding the carbon sequestered as CO2. The average C balance for the 6 years corresponds to an average annual growth rate of the peatland surface of 1.3 mm yr-1.

AB Biomass and carbon accumulation into tree stand and distribution between tree stand components was studied in two undrained and four drained Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) dominated peatland stands in southern Finland. On the drained sites, the amount and distribution of biomass above-ground was rather similar to pine-dominated stands on upland sites when drainage age of the site was thought to represent the stand age. The proportion of estimated below-ground biomass of the total pine biomass was ca. 30% on all sites studied which is mon than on upland sites with supposedly similar growth potential. Due to the bigger amount of below-ground biomass, there is, on average, more biomass and thus also carbon in relation to stem volume in peatland stands than upland stands, when southern boreal Scots pine stands are examined. Equations for estimating the amount of carbon accumulating in the tree stand along with increasing stem volume are presented. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB 1. Growth in length and weight of three species of Sphagnum (S. fuscum, S. magellanicum and S. fallax) was studied in a glasshouse experiment. The Sphagnum mosses were cultivated at natural density on cores of five different peat types, representing a gradient of increasing disturbance. Two water levels were controlled and maintained to simulate natural and drained situations.
   2. Significant differences in the growth of the three Sphagnum species were observed. Canonical multivariate analyses showed decreasing influence by explanatory variables in the order: species > water level > peat-type.
   3. S. fallax was more sensitive both to water table depth and to peat properties. Yet, in the Swiss Jura Mountains, it is the most widespread species in paludification processes of drained bogs after the cessation of peat mining or harvesting. This apparent paradox is discussed.
   4. Feat type was influential only when the water table was maintained at a low level (-40 cm), simulating drained conditions. Results of analyses taking into account peat physical and chemical properties show that drained sites undergo a strong chemical disturbance, which, in turn, affects the growth of Sphagnum mosses. However, depending on the evolution of the peat, a particular combination of chemical and physical properties may favour the growth of Sphagnum mosses even at a low water table.
   5. In setting priorities for bog restoration, S. fallax should be favoured as a pioneer to stimulate a rapid colonization and recovery of Sphagnum lawns on which other species, more characteristic of the ombrotrophic bog environment, can re-establish.

AB Weekly monitoring of surface water chemistry took place over a one-year period in a small boggy sub-catchment of the River Thurso, northern Scotland. Monitoring started 6 months after the felling to waste of plantation conifers. The chemistry of ground surface waters was monitored at four bog sites situated in former forestry plots as well as one control site situated in an intact bog. The chemistry of the receiving stream (Sleach Water) was monitored at seven points along a 2 km stretch.
   Dissolved organic carbon and metals were very significantly affected by seasonal factors. On land, seasonal variations accounted for between 35% (Al) and 80% (Fe) of the total variance in the data at the intact bog site, with similar seasonal effects observed at the impacted sites. The amplitude of the seasonal signal was generally much higher at the impacted sites than at the control site.
   Except for dissolved Al and Mn, the chemical composition of the stream was only marginally influenced by surface runoff from the felled plantation despite evidence of intense seasonal mobilisation of e.g. DOC. K or Fe at or near the ground surface within the felled plots. This was attributed to the presence of a buffer zone between the plantation and the stream. On the other hand, surface inputs from former forestry plots caused measurable increases in stream water (Al) and [Mn]. The likely sources of Al and Mn were the disturbance of the mineral soil that had taken place some 20 years previously as a result of forestry ground preparation and the leaching from the recently felled conifer material, respectively. Such inputs occurred in late autumn or winter for Al and in summer for Mn, thus intensifying their natural seasonal patterns in this peat draining stream. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands, including those transformed by economic activities (drainage for forestry and agriculture, peat extraction), belong to various land categories. There is no general system for their inventory and accounting. Remote sensing methodology based on high-resolution space imagery is proposed and applied for mapping peatlands of different types and states based on the example of Moscow oblast. The methodology can be used to solve scientific and practical tasks that require the development of a regional peatland geoin-formation system (GIS) using a common base map. The total area of peatlands and peatbogs is shown to surpass 6% of the oblast territory.

AB In arctic and sub-arctic environments, mercury (Hg), more specifically toxic methylmercury (MeHg), is of growing concern to local communities because of its accumulation in fish. In these regions, there is particular interest in the potential mobilization of atmospherically deposited Hg sequestered in permafrost that is thawing at unprecedented rates. Permafrost thaw and the resulting ground surface subsidence transforms forested peat plateaus into treeless and permafrost-free thermokarst wetlands where inorganic Hg released from the thawed permafrost and draining from the surrounding peat plateaus may be transformed to MeHg. This study begins to characterize the spatial distribution of MeHg in a peat plateau-thermokarst wetland complex, a feature that prevails throughout the wetland-dominated southern margin of thawing discontinuous permafrost in Canada's Northwest Territories. We measured pore water total Hg, MeHg, dissolved organic matter characteristics and general water chemistry parameters to evaluate the role of permafrost thaw on the pattern of water chemistry. A gradient in vegetation composition, water chemistry and dissolved organic matter characteristics followed a toposequence from the ombrotrophic bogs near the crest of the complex to poor fens at its downslope margins. We found that pore waters in poor fens contained elevated levels of MeHg, and the water draining from these features had dissolved MeHg concentrations 4.5 to 14.5 times higher than the water draining from the bogs. It was determined through analysis of historical aerial images that the poor fens in the toposequence had formed relatively recently (early 1970s) as a result of permafrost thaw. Differences between the fens and bogs are likely to be a result of their differences in groundwater function, and this suggests that permafrost thaw in this landscape can result in hotspots for Hg methylation that are hydrologically connected to downstream ecosystems.

AB Historical drainage of peatlands across the East Anglian Fenlands has led to subsidence and degradation of the vast majority of the regional peat resource, to the extent that many areas can no longer be classified as peatland. Water-table management strategies have been introduced to reduce the rate at which these peatlands subside and physically and biochemically degrade. We assessed the rate of subsidence and extent of peat soil degradation across an intensively farmed peatland where such water management measures have been introduced. When compared against historical reports of subsidence across the East Anglian Fenlands, the rate of subsidence does appear to have reduced over the last two decades. The rate of subsidence does, however, vary spatially and is dependent on the geographical distribution of peat types and underlying mineral deposits. The rate of subsidence and peat degradation has been greater in soil profiles which had a higher proportion of semi-fibrous and fibrous pears in 1982/3, compared against those with a higher proportion of humified peat in 1982/3. Over the last 22 years the proportion of more fibrous peat in all peat deposits has decreased to the extent that areas once classified as fibrous peat are now dominated by humified peat. This suggests that future subsidence will be less influenced by shrinkage and controlled by biochemical processes. Where Fen Clay underlies a peat deposit it acts as an impermeable boundary, thus keeping the overlying peat more saturated and reducing the degree of peat consolidation. However, the presence of Fen Clay also increases the degree of biochemical degradation of overlying fibrous peat horizons. Indeed, where drains have been laid within such mineral strata there is an increase in soil acidity. During autumnal drainage operations the environment is therefore optimised for sulfate reducing bacteria, resulting in acid sulfate soils with increased rates of degradation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents estimates of the costs and benefits of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through fen wetland restoration. This study takes previous research on GHG emissions from peat wetlands further by coupling water-level-dependent emission functions with a landscape- and basin-scale assessment of the hydrology and water management of wetlands. For this purpose we use a water management model for the Elbe River Basin that includes the major lowland fen wetland sites as water users. Based on the resultant estimates of the GHG emissions of wetlands and the reduction potential of management options under a more realistic description of water availability, this paper provides improved estimates of the benefits of restoration in terms of the shadow price of carbon and the GHG abatement costs of wetland restoration measures. An econometric approach is used to develop abatement cost estimates for wetland restoration. We find mean current emissions over 35 wetland sites (3840 km(2)) to be in the range of 17.525.5 tCO2e ha-1. The median of estimated abatement costs for fen stabilisation scenarios are within a range of epsilon 1020 tCO2e-1 and for restoration scenarios in a range of epsilon 714 tCO2e-1. Fen wetland restoration can therefore potentially contribute to mitigation targets at low cost. An approach focused on restoration is a more efficient strategy compared to an approach centred on agri-environmental schemes, even though both components are required in a zoning approach. However the effects of climatic change may reduce the effectiveness of wetland restoration measures by roughly 50%. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We studied the potential effects of management and harvesting intensity on the timber supply from Finnish forests in a changing climate and, consequently, the possibilities of meeting the increasing wood demand of the growing forest-based bioeconomy. The study employed data from the 11th National Forest Inventory of Finland. Plots located on forest land assigned to timber production were used to develop two even-flow harvesting scenarios with annual timber harvesting targets of 60 and 80 million m(3). Calculations were done for a 90-year simulation period under the current and changing climates using recent-generation (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) global climate model projections under three representative concentration pathways forcing scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5). Intensified management used improved seed and seedling stock in artificial regeneration. It also used fertilization on subxeric pine-dominated and mesic spruce-dominated stands and ditch maintenance on 40% of drained peatlands, when the growing stock characteristics fulfilled a set of predetermined criteria. Our results showed that, with intensified management, it is possible to harvest 80 million m(3).year(-1) of timber under mild (RCP2.6) and moderate (RCP4.5) climate change without decreasing the growing stock volume at the country level during the 90-year simulation period. This is not possible under severe climate change (RCP8.5) due to the rapid decline in forest growth, particularly in the south after about 30 years.

AB Common objectives of afforestation of cut-away peatlands are the diminution of nutrition loads and the production of energy wood in an efficient and economic way. We studied the effect of fertilization and afforestation methods on the early establishment of downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) seedlings on a cut-away peatland. Six treatments of peat-ash, wood-ash, biotite, or PK-fertilizer were replicated in three blocks in different mixtures corresponding to 50 kg/ha of phosphorous. Birch seeds were sown in randomized halves of split plots, while other halves were naturally afforested. Natural afforestation was equal to sowing in terms of seedling amounts due to closeness of surrounding birch stands with abundant seed crops. After the first growing season the greatest quantities and dominant heights of birch seedlings appeared on the ash-fertilized plots, whereas on the unfertilized areas both the establishment and growth of seedlings was very poor. On the other hand, the quantity of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings was more than three times higher on the unfertilized areas compared to the ash-fertilized areas. The differences between the fertilized and the unfertilized areas accentuated during the four observation years. Our results support regular use of ash-fertilizers for the afforestation of cut-away peatlands instead of the ash being deposited as a waste in landfills. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We estimated CH4 and N2O emissions from the main land-use types in rural landscapes using data from the literature (950 study sites/experiments from the temperate and boreal zone published from 1980 to 2009 in 165 scientific papers indexed by the ISI Web of Science) and assessed the emission potential of CH4 and N2O from rural landscapes in Estonia. According to this analysis, natural peatlands and marshes appeared to be the most important CH4 emitters, whereas N2O is emitted mainly from drained peatlands and marshes, set aside areas, conventional arable lands, fertilized grasslands, and coniferous and mixed forests - all on hydromorphic soils. The estimated median value of annual CH4-C and N2O-N fluxes for Estonian rural landscapes are 25,519 and 11,050t respectively. CH4 consumption makes up 13.2% of the emission. The largest CH4 emitters are peatlands (17,746 tCH(4)-C year(-1); 60%), whereas coniferous and mixed forests on hydromorphic soils with altered hydrologic regime are responsible for the bulk (51%) of N2O fluxes. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) of Estonian rural land-use types (42,685 km(2)) from potential CH4 and N2O fluxes is 5.99 million t of CO2 equivalents, of which N2O is responsible for 86%. Several measures for the further mitigation of greenhouse gas emission from rural landscapes are proposed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ditches are common in landscapes influenced by agricultural, forestry, and peat mining activities, and their value as corridors remains unassessed. Pond-breeding amphibians can encounter hostile environments when moving between breeding, summering, or hibernation sites, and are likely to benefit from the presence of ditches in the landscape. Within a system consisting of ditch networks in bogs mined for peat in eastern New Brunswick, Canada, I quantified the breeding, survival, and movements of green frogs (Rana clamitans melanota) in drainage ditches and also surveyed peat fields. Frogs rarely ventured on peat fields and most individuals frequented drainage ditches containing water, particularly in late summer. Though frogs did not breed in ditches, their survival rate in ditches was high (88%). Ditches did not hinder frog movements, as frogs moved independently of the current. Results indicate that drainage ditches containing water enable some movements between habitats isolated by peat mining, in contrast to peat surfaces, and suggest they function as amphibian movement corridors. Thus, such drainage ditches may mitigate the effects of peat extraction on amphibian populations. At the very least, these structures provide an alternative to hostile peat surfaces. This study highlights that small-scale corridors are potentially valuable in population dynamics.

AB Biodiversity in wetland habitats is strongly affected by drainage. In Sweden, rich fens (alkaline fens) have been particularly affected by drainage campaigns for forestry and conversion to agricultural land. Fragmentation of the landscape, invasion of tall vascular plants as well as Polytrichum and Sphagnum mosses and substrate degradation all lead to reduced plant diversity.
   We evaluated the recolonization potential of four characteristic rich fen bryophyte species that use to decrease rapidly after drainage (Scorpidium scorpioides, Scorpidium cossonii, Pseudocalliergon trifarium and Campylium stellatum) by performing transplantation studies with gametophyte fragments in recently hydrologically restored rich fens. In greenhouse and field experiments I cm fragments of all four species had a high survival rate and established well, especially after surface liming of the peat. A protective cover increased the colonization success and the growth potential of the added fragments. Even small alterations of the water level (5 cm) resulted in differences in biomass growth of the fragments of S. cossonii and C. stellatum. Our results show that it is possible to reintroduce bryophyte species lost after drainage using gametophyte fragments as propagules, and that these techniques seem feasible for a number of characteristic rich fen bryophytes. These findings will be of importance when methods for practical restoration of rich fens are developed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Several boreal fens belong to the patterned fen category, which is composed of two compartments, the pool (or hollow), and the string (or hummock) compartments. Both compartments are distributed perpendicular to the mire slope and drainage flow. The surface of patterned fens is repeatedly invaded by water, which is known to affect the original pool-string pattern through the creation and enlargement of pools, a process caused by the action of aqualysis. Aqualysis refers to the destruction of the vegetation cover by flooding of low-elevated strings or lawns causing the formation and enlargement of pools. It is argued here that the nature and composition of the pool structure (number and size) reveal the state of development of patterned fens of the boreal environment. Quantitative and spatial data for pool size structure in 24 fens of northern Quebec, including 4881 pools, were used for the assessment of patterned fen development. Among the main factors influencing patterned fen development, area and slope contribute to the construction of the peatland surface. Also, watershed area, alternating strings and hollows, and peat thickness all facilitate pool creation and expansion. The construction of the pool structure of most fens has been a long process of ecosystem building. This probably explains why most sloping fens, i.e, moderate-and steep-sloping fens, are today at an equilibrium stage characterized by the coexistence of pools of all sizes with the smallest pools being the most numerous. In contrast, most low-sloping fens have developed toward a lacustrine stage with a bimodal distribution of small and very large pools. Boreal patterned fens of all developmental stages will be subject to increased pool size and number in the near future if more humid climatic conditions prevail.

AB Mechanisms for preserving the hydrological balance of Thorne Moors National Nature Reserve (NNR) while allowing peat extraction to continue in the surrounding peatland are examined.  Three strategies exist for modifying seepage losses from the NNR: (I) re-direction of pump drainage waters from the peat extraction areas; (II) provision of a hydrological buffer zone around the NNR; and (III) mechanical compaction of the boundaries of the buffer zone. Strategy II (increased width of the buffer zone) should be used together with strategy III (compaction) for the maximum reduction of seepage losses from the NNR. If strategy I (water level manipulation) is also adopted, it may be possible to reduce the width of the hydrological buffer zone around the NNR.

AB Forest clearfelling is potentially a major environmental problem with respect to the degradation of water quality in receiving water courses due to phosphorus (P) release from soil and clearfelling residue stocks. Recent studies have highlighted the need to investigate the performance and benefits of potential mitigation methods such as whole tree harvesting (WTH) and grass seeding. In this study, fifteen plots (0.014 ha each) were constructed in a standing coniferous forest and P concentrations in plot runoff were monitored for one year prior to clearfelling. Following clearfelling three replicates of five forest harvesting management practices/treatments were applied to the plots: brash with grass seeding (Treatment 1), brash (Treatment 2), brash mat/ tree extraction route (Treatment 3), WTH (Treatment 4) and WTH with grass seeding (Treatment 5). These treatments were designed to comparatively assess the benefits of WTH and grass seeding practices on mitigating P released from forested peatlands following clearfelling and to determine the sources and sinks of P following clearfelling operations. Annual average total reactive phosphorus (TRP) concentrations in the plot runoff were < 20 mu g L-1 in all treatments before clearfelling, and increased to 79 mu g L-1, 160 mu g L-1, 335 mu g L-1, 50 mu g L-1 and 38 mu g L-1 in Treatments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively, after clearfelling. These results highlight that WTH and grass seeding can be used efficiently as methods to improve water quality, aiding in the protection of the biota residing in the aquatic systems draining peatland catchments.

DE historical geography; Amstel; Amstelland; Mediaeval peat reclamation
AB Around 800 AD the peatlands around Amstelland were drained by two rivers. The 'northern' Amstel discharged surplus water directly into Lake Almere, which from the 12th century onwards was enlarged to form the Sudersee (in Dutch: Zuiderzee). The 'southern' Amstel was a near-abandoned westernmost arm of the River Vecht discharging the poorly drained borderland around the river Vecht into Lake Almere/the Sudersee. As part of the reclamation of peatlands associated with agricultural activities between the end of the 10th and the mid-13th centuries, the rivers were connected via a canal, thus creating the river Amstel, as it is known today.

AB The mechanisms involved in the initiation and development of the Greater Everglades peatland ecosystems remain a topic of discussion. In this study, we first present an overview of basal ages of peat deposits in South Florida, which shows two major episodes of peatland initiation between 7.0-4.5kyr and 3.5-2.0kyr. Our analysis of regional climate proxy data sets led to three alternative hypotheses that may explain the timing and duration of these two peatland initiation episodes: (1) decreased drainage due to relative sea level (RSL) rise during the Holocene, (2) gradual increase in precipitation throughout the Holocene, and (3) a combination of increasing precipitation, rising RSL, and oscillations in the climate system. We test whether these three hypotheses can explain the pattern of initiation and development of the Greater Everglades peatlands using models that simulate the nonlinear processes involved in peat production and decomposition. The model results suggest that RSL rise could explain the onset of peatland initiation and imply that the climate was wet enough for peat development also during the early Holocene. The first two hypothesized mechanisms in combination with climate oscillations may explain the onset of peat accumulation at 8.2kyr B.P. The two-phased character of peatland initiation maybe explained by the spatial distribution of local drainage conditions. As peatland development is highly nonlinear, our model uncovers a mechanistic way how peats can suddenly shift from a dry high equilibrium to a wet low equilibrium resulting in lake formation as observed in paleoecological studies in the Greater Everglades.

SO GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
LA English
DT Article
DE Climate change; Bio-waste; Coconut fiber; Canal block; Peat ecosystem
AB Peat ecosystems play a very important role in controlling global climate stability. Massive channel development in the peatland ecosystem can have an impact on excessive drying of peatland, which is caused by increased water flow rate and decreased water-saving power in the peat region and implicates the increased oxidation, and the vulnerability of fire hazards which contribute to the disaster of climate change. Recovery of degraded and drained peat can be done by building peat rewetting infrastructure, one of which is canal blocking. This study aims to utilize bio-waste material namely coconut fiber waste (CFW) for composite panels for canal block modules. This research was carried out using the hand lay-up method, with composite compositions in the form of polyester, fiberglass, wire mesh, and coconut fiber. The results showed that the composition of the type C composite panel samples had a density value of 0.0853 gr/cm(3), the moisture content value was only 0.16%, thickness swelling was only 0.11%, and the length swelling was only 0.01%, better than other samples. Besides, the type C composite panel sample is also better, with a modulus of rupture (MoR) of 21.845 kgf/ mm(2), modulus of elasticity (MoE) value of 78.057 kgf/mm(2), and impact energy 79.66 Joules. It is expected that coconut fiber waste can be processed and used optimally as a bio-waste for canal block in preventing fire hazards (disaster climate change).

AB Peat decomposition has micro-scale heterogeneity because the rate of decomposition differs between micro-local conditions related to pore distribution, botanical composition, and differences in plant parts. Therefore, the heterogeneity of peat decomposition degree in micro-scale can be a good indicator for further understanding of peat decomposition process. However, previous studies using "bulk analysis" have denoted peat heterogeneity as merely chemical structural diversity, and did not examine the heterogeneity of peat constituents at a microscopic level. This study aimed to obtain peat heterogeneity in the micro-scale as a new indicator of peat decomposition and conducted "heterogeneity analysis" as follows: (1) analyzing a decomposition index of individual peat micro-fragments using spectral data from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) micro-spectroscopy and principal component analysis (PCA) for specific absorption intensities, and (2) determining the distribution of peat decomposition index as an indicator of the heterogeneity of peaty soils. Twelve peaty horizons were sampled from three sites on coastal or alluvial plains. These horizons were buried under mineral soils used for rice cultivation. We applied PCA to 775 infrared (IR) spectra obtained from observed peat micro-fragments and calculated the micro-fragment decomposition degree (MDD) which was the first principal component score explained by a decrease in C-H single bonds and a relative increase in polymerized aromatic C=C double bonds. The distribution range of MDD demonstrated that heterogeneity of decomposition degree tends to be large in mid-decomposed peat. Moreover, the bimodal distribution pattern of MDD represented heterogeneous state formed by mineral inter-bedding in peat. Therefore, "heterogeneity analysis" could effectively represent the intrinsic heterogeneity of peat decomposition degree without losing the microscopic diversity.

AB This article examines alternative forest harvesting regimes when ecosystem services in terms of water quality, biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation are included in the analysis. The harvesting regimes are whole-tree harvesting with stump removal and conventional stem-only harvesting. The harvesting regimes are evaluated under two alternative climate policy contexts. The first alternative is a carbon neutral bioenergy policy, which assumes the carbon dioxide (CO2) neutrality of bioenergy and produces substitution benefits, as bioenergy replaces fossil fuels. The second alternative climate policy, a carbon non-neutral bioenergy policy, takes into account the fact that bioenergy causes carbon dioxide emissions, producing substitution costs, and that harvested woody biomass affects the ability of a forest to act as a carbon sink. We extend the traditional Faustmann (1849) rotation model to include nutrient load damage, biodiversity benefits, and climate impacts. The empirical analysis is based on Finnish data from a catchment experiment carried out on drained peatland forests. The empirical results show that under a carbon neutral bioenergy policy, whole-tree harvesting with stump removal produces the highest net social benefits. However, if a carbon non-neutral bioenergy policy is assumed, the net social benefits are greater under stem-only harvesting. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reflooding formerly drained peatlands has been proposed as a means to reduce losses of organic matter and sequester soil carbon for climate change mitigation, but a renewal of high methane emissions has been reported for these ecosystems, offsetting mitigation potential. Our ability to interpret observed methane fluxes in reflooded peatlands and make predictions about future flux trends is limited due to a lack of detailed studies of methanogenic processes. In this study we investigate methanogenesis in a reflooded agricultural peatland in the Sacramento Delta, California. We use the stable-and radio-carbon isotopic signatures of wetland sediment methane, ecosystem-scale eddy covariance flux observations, and laboratory incubation experiments, to identify which carbon sources and methanogenic production pathways fuel methanogenesis and how these processes are affected by vegetation and seasonality. We found that the old peat contribution to annual methane emissions was large (~30%) compared to intact wetlands, indicating a biogeochemical legacy of drainage. However, fresh carbon and the acetoclastic pathway still accounted for the majority of methanogenesis throughout the year. Although temperature sensitivities for bulk peat methanogenesis were similar between open-water (Q(10) = 2.1) and vegetated (Q(10) = 2.3) soils, methane production from both fresh and old carbon sources showed pronounced seasonality in vegetated zones. We conclude that high methane emissions in restored wetlands constitute a biogeochemical trade-off with contemporary carbon uptake, given that methane efflux is fueled primarily by fresh carbon inputs.

AB Carbon export in streams draining peat catchments represents a potential loss of carbon from long-term stores to downstream aquatic systems and ultimately, through mineralisation, to the atmosphere. There is now a large body of evidence that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export has increased significantly in recent decades at many sites, although there is still debate about the drivers of this increase. In this study, DOC export and particulate organic carbon (POC) export were quantified from a forested peatland catchment in the west of Ireland over two years at a fine temporal resolution. The principle drivers of change in stream DOC and POC concentrations were investigated using a general additive modelling (GAM) approach. The study period included drought conditions in the early summer of 2010 and clearfelling of some commercial forestry in early 2011. The results indicated that annual loads of 9.5 t DOC km(2) year(-1) and 6.2 t POC km(2) year(-1) were exported from the catchment in 2010. This combined annual load of 15.7 t C km(2) year(-1) would represent between 0.01% and 0.02% of typical estimates for peat soil carbon storage in the region. Soil temperature, river discharge and drought explained 59.7% the deviance in DOC concentrations, while soil temperature, river discharge, and rainfall were the significant drivers of variation in POC concentrations, explaining 58.3% of deviance. Although clearfelling was not a significant factor in either model, large spikes in POC export occurred in 2011 after the first forestry clearance. The results illustrate the complexity of the interactions between climate and land management in driving stream water carbon export. They also highlight the sensitivity of peatland carbon stores to changes in temperature and precipitation, which are projected to be more extreme and variable under future climate scenarios.

AB Year-round flooding provides a common land management practice to reestablish the natural carbon dioxide (CO2) sink function of drained peatlands. Here we present eddy covariance measurements of net CO2 exchange from a temperate fen during three consecutive growing seasons (May-October) that span a period of conversion from moderately rewetting to flooding. When we started our measurements in 2009, the hydrological conditions were representative for the preceding 20years with a mean growing season water level (MWGL) of 0cm but considerably lower water levels in summer. Flooding began in 2010 with an MWGL of 36cm above the surface. The fen was a net CO2 sink throughout all growing seasons (2009: -333.312.3, 2010: -294.18.4, 2011: -352.45.1g C m(-2)), but magnitudes of canopy photosynthesis (CP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) differed distinctively. Rates of CP and Reco were high before flooding, dropped by 46% and 61%, respectively, in 2010, but increased again during the beginning of growing season 2011 until the water level started to rise further due to strong rainfalls during June and July. We assume that flooding decreases not only the CO2 release due to inhibited Reco under anaerobic conditions but also CO2 sequestration rates are constricted due to decreased CP. We conclude that rewetting might act as a disturbance for a plant community that has adapted to drier conditions after decades of drainage. However, if the recent species are still abundant, a rise in CP and autotrophic Reco can be expected after plants have developed plastic response strategies to wetter conditions.

AB Peatlands are a major source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for aquatic ecosystems. Naturally high DOC concentrations in peatlands may be increased further by drainage. For agricultural purposes, peat has frequently been mixed with sand, but the effect of this measure on the release and cycling of DOC has rarely been investigated. This study examined the effects of (i) mixing peat with sand and (ii) water table depth (WTD) on DOC concentrations at three grassland sites on shallow organic soils. The soil solution was sampled bi-weekly for two years with suction plates at 15, 30 and 60 cm depth. Selected samples were analysed for dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), delta C-13(Dom) and delta N-15(DOM.)
   Average DOC concentrations were surprisingly high, ranging from 161 to 192 mg 1(-1). There was no significant impact of soil organic carbon (SOC) content or WTD on mean DOC concentrations. At all sites, DOC concentrations were highest at the boundary between the SOC-rich horizon and the mineral subsoil. In contrast to the mean concentrations, the temporal patterns of DOC concentrations, their drivers and the properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) differed between peat-sand mixtures and peat. DOC concentrations responded to changes in environmental conditions, but only after a lag period of a few weeks. At the sites with a peat-sand mixture, temperature and therefore probably biological activity determined the DOC concentrations. At the peat site, the contribution of vegetation derived DOM was higher. The highest concentrations occurred during long, cool periods of waterlogging, suggesting a stronger physicochemical-based DOC mobilisation. Overall, these results indicate that mixing peat with sand does not improve water quality and.may result in DOC losses of around 200 kg DOC ha(-1) a(-1). (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB In contrast to numerous studies on the dynamics of dissolved (< 0.45 mu m) elements in permafrost-affected highlatitude rivers, very little is known of the behavior of river suspended (> 0.45 mu m) matter (RSM) in these regions. In order to test the effect of climate, permafrost and physiogeographical landscape parameters (bogs, forest and lake coverage of the watershed) on RSM and particulate C, N and P concentrations in river water, we sampled 33 small and medium-sized rivers (10-100 000 km(2) watershed) along a 1700 km N-S transect including both permafrost-affected and permafrost-free zones of the Western Siberian Lowland (WSL). The concentrations of C and N in RSM decreased with the increase in river watershed size, illustrating (i) the importance of organic debris in small rivers which drain peatlands and (ii) the role of mineral matter from bank abrasion in larger rivers. The presence of lakes in the watershed increased C and N but decreased P concentrations in the RSM. The C V N ratio in the RSM reflected the source from the deep soil horizon rather than surface soil horizon, similar to that of other Arctic rivers. This suggests the export of peat and mineral particles through suprapermafrost flow occurring at the base of the active layer. There was a maximum of both particulate C and N concentrations and export fluxes at the beginning of permafrost appearance, in the sporadic and discontinuous zone (62-64 degrees N). This presumably reflected the organic matter mobilization from newly thawed organic horizons in soils at the active latitudinal thawing front. The results suggest that a northward shift of permafrost boundaries and an increase in active layer thickness may increase particulate C and N export by WSL rivers to the Arctic Ocean by a factor of 2, while P export may remain unchanged. In contrast, within a long-term climate warming scenario, the disappearance of permafrost in the north, the drainage of lakes and transformation of bogs to forest may decrease C and N concentrations in RSM by 2 to 3 times.

AB The Common Crane (Grus grus) population has experienced an unprecedented increase across Europe during the last decades. Although cranes feed mostly on invertebrates, amphibians and berries during the breeding season, they can also eat eggs and young of other birds. Therefore, conservationists have raised concerns about the potential predatory effect of cranes on wetland avifauna, but the effects of crane predation on bird numbers have so far not been investigated. We here test the relationship between the crane and peatland bird population' abundances in Finland for five common wader and passerine species, and a set of seven less common waders, using line-transect data spanning from 1987 to 2014. We found that the population densities of two small passerines (Meadow Pipit Anthus pratensis and Western Yellow Wagtail Motacilla flava) and one wader species (Wood Sandpiper Tringa glareola) were positively associated with crane numbers, probably related to a protective effect against nest predators. For the two other common species and the set of less common waders, we did not find any significant relationships with crane abundance. None of the species was influenced by the (lagged) effect of crane presence (i.e. years since crane was first observed). Peatland drainage was responsible for most species' negative densities, indicating the need to protect and restore peatlands to mitigate the loss of peatland bird diversity in Finland. In addition, openness, wetness and area size were important peatland characteristics positively influencing most of the studied bird populations. The development in crane and other mire bird numbers in Europe should be monitored regularly to reveal any possible future predatory effects contributing to the shaping of the peatland bird community.

   Parliament; religion
AB Oliver Cromwell's many biographers have been puzzled by his elections as MP for Cambridge in 1640. His connections with the town at this time were slight. Historians have, therefore, fallen back on his supposed opposition to the draining of the fens or, more recently, on possible aristocratic patronage. This article proposes a new theory, based on a rehabilitation of a very old source, James Heath's Flagellum, one of the earliest Cromwell biographies. Heath claimed that Cromwell had been elected with the support of a group of minor members of the corporation. Although very garbled, the Flagellum account probably records genuine details about the election and the men it identified as Cromwell's key supporters can be shown to have opposed the religious policies of the local bishop, Matthew Wren of Ely. Cromwell was probably elected as a critic of Wren.

AB Whole-tree harvesting is an increasingly common harvesting method due to the high demand for fuel chips. In whole-tree harvesting, nutrient removal from the site is substantially higher than in cut-to-length harvesting, in which nutrient-rich branches and unmerchantable top sections of trees are left in the cutting area. There is a concern that whole-tree harvesting impairs site productivity, especially on mires drained for forestry. We employed six field experiments to study the effects of the harvesting method used on the amount of logging residues left on the site in the thinning of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands. The four harvesting treatments varied in their intensity of biomass removal from conventional stem-only harvesting (CTL), where tree tops and branches were left on the site to whole-tree harvesting (WTH) complemented by the manual collection of residues. Logging residues left on the sites were weighed and sampled to determine their moisture content. After CTL, the amount of logging residues left on the site was 7780-15340 kg ha(-1)(dry mass), depending on the experiment. In (WTH) the amount of logging residues left on the site was 32-66% of that of CTL. After the manual collection of residues in WTH, 4-16% of the residues still remained on the sites. The residues left at site following WTH had a larger share of small-diameter material than after CTL. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Forty percentage of UK peatlands have been drained for agricultural use, which has caused serious peat wastage and associated greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)). In this study, we evaluated potential trade-offs between water-table management practices for minimizing peat wastage and greenhouse gas emissions, while seeking to sustain romaine lettuce production: one of the most economically relevant crop in the East Anglian Fenlands. In a controlled environment experiment, we measured lettuce yield, CO2, CH4 fluxes and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released from an agricultural fen soil at two temperatures (ambient and +2 degrees C) and three water-table levels (-30 cm, -40 cm and -50 cm below the surface). We showed that increasing the water table from the currently used field level of -50 cm to -40 cm and -30 cm reduced CO2 emissions, did not affect CH4 fluxes, but significantly reduced yield and increased DOC leaching. Warming of 2 degrees C increased both lettuce yield (fresh leaf biomass) and peat decomposition through the loss of carbon as CO2 and DOC. However, there was no difference in the dry leaf biomass between the intermediate (-40 cm) and the low (-50 cm) water table, suggesting that romaine lettuce grown at this higher water level should have similar energetic value as the crop cultivated at -50 cm, representing a possible compromise to decrease peat oxidation and maintain agricultural production.

AB Extreme hydrological events are known to contribute significantly to total annual carbon export, the largest of which in Arctic and boreal catchments is spring snowmelt. Whilst previous work has quantified the export of carbon during snowmelt, the source of the carbon remains unclear. Here we use cation hydrochemistry to trace the primary flowpaths which govern the export of carbon during the snowmelt period; specifically we aim to examine the importance of snowpack meltwater to catchment carbon export. The study was carried out in two forested peatland (drained and undrained) catchments in Eastern Finland. Both catchments were characterised by base-poor stream water chemistry, with cation concentrations generally decreasing in response to increasing discharge. Streamflow during the snowmelt period was best described as a mixture of three sources: pre-event water, snowpack meltwater and a third dilute component we attribute to the upper snow layer which was chemically similar to recent precipitation. Over the study period, pre-event water contributed 32% and 43% of the total stream runoff in Valipuro (undrained) and Suopuro (drained), respectively. The results also suggest a greater near-surface throughflow component in Suopuro, the drained catchment, prior to snowmelt. CO2 and DOC concentrations correlated positively with cation concentrations in both catchments indicating a common, peat/groundwater flowpath. CH4 concentrations were significantly higher in the drained catchment and appeared to be transported in near-surface throughflow. Meltwater from the snowpack represented an important source of stream water CO2 in both catchments, contributing up to 49% of total downstream CO2 export during the study period. We conclude that the snowpack represents a potentially important, and often overlooked, transient carbon store in boreal snow-covered catchments. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Ecological restoration is expected to reverse the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Due to the low number of well-replicated field studies, the extent to which restoration recovers plant communities, and the factors underlying possible shortcomings, are not well understood even in medium term. We compared the plant community composition of 38 sites comprising pristine, forestry-drained, and 5 or 10 years ago restored peatlands in southern Finland, with special interest in understanding spatial variation within studied sites, as well as the development of the numbers and the abundances of target species. Our results indicated a recovery of community composition 5-10 years after restoration, but there was significant heterogeneity in recovery. Plant communities farthest away from ditches were very similar to their pristine reference already 10 years after restoration. In contrast, communities in the ditches were as far from the target as the drained communities. The recovery appears to be characterized by a decline in the number and abundance of species typical to degraded conditions, and increase in the abundance of characteristic peatland species. However, we found no increase above the drained state in the number of characteristic peatland species. Our results suggest that there is a risk of drawing premature conclusions on the efficiency of ecological restoration with the current practice of short-term monitoring. Our results also illustrate fine-scale within-site spatial variability in the degradation and recovery of the plant communities that should be considered when evaluating the success of restoration. Overall, we find the heterogeneous outcome of restoration observed here promising. However, low recovery in the number of characteristic species demonstrates the importance of prioritizing restoration sites, and addressing the uncertainty of recovery when setting restoration targets. It appears that it is easier to eradicate unwanted species than regain characteristic species by restoration.

ID DECOMPOSITION
AB Trees of Pinus rotundata (bog pine) characterise many bogs in the mid-altitude mountains of central Europe (Switzerland, East and South Germany, Czech Republic). The research described here focuses on recent changes in the growth of bog pine on the Ennersbacher Moor, a mountain mire in the Black Forest (south-west Germany). An increase in the cover of bog pine is usually caused by drainage and subsequent drawdown of the water table. However, this bog has not been drained or directly disturbed in any other way. One possible explanation is that a road constructed in 1983 along one margin of the bog has diverted part of its water supply. Even though the road was designed to conduct potentially salt-contaminated drainage water away from the bog, its construction did not cause an immediate vegetation response in the 1980s and 1990s. Therefore, I hypothesise that it enhanced the sensitivity of the bog to climatic stress, predisposing it to a succession that was eventually triggered by a series of drought years in 2009-2011. Data collected near the centre of the bog over the period 1998-2014 indicate not only a distinct change in the relationship between height and trunk circumference of the trees, but also an increase of dwarf shrub cover and changes in the composition of Sphagnum communities. Although the pH of near-surface water may have increased slightly over this period, pH and EC values remain within typical ranges for raised bogs in the Black Forest. Examination of peat profiles reveals that the peat is more highly humified now than it was in 2002, and water table records from 2012-2014 show a greater amplitude of fluctuation than water table data collected in 1998-2001. Even though its mean level is only 105 mm below the ground surface, the water table is now observed to fall rapidly to depths of at least 350 mm during both wet and dry summers. Mapping surface (meso) topography and flow lines from the adjacent slope shows that the Ennersbacher Moor is not domed in this direction, so that water arriving from upslope would reach the bog centre if the road were not present. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that the observed succession is a delayed effect of construction of the road.

AB Vast areas of peatlands have been drained for forestry endangering their carbon sink function. Peatland rewetting aims at mitigating the situation through restoring the hydrology and vegetation of these areas. We compared the carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and phytomass on four pairs of rewetted and pristine peatland sites in Finland and Estonia, and described correlations between phytomass and CO2 fluxes. We measured the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), respiration and photosynthesis over one growing season using manual chambers, and biomass of plant functional types (PFT) on rewetted sites and their pristine counterparts. Although pair-wise differences in the vegetation were small, pristine sites were on average stronger CO2 sinks than rewetted sites. Respiration was higher in hummocks while no differences were found in photosynthesis between hummocks and hollows. No clear relationship between the biomasses of PFTs and NEE was found. Generally, however, CO2 uptake decreased with increase in Sphagnum biomass.

AB 1. Peatlands are globally important habitats, which act as net carbon stores. As a result of drainage, peat extraction and agricultural intensification, raised bogs in the midlands of Ireland are a diminishing and increasingly fragmented peatland habitat. A network of protected sites has been established, which is intended to represent the best abiotic and plant community systems.
   2. Lepidoteran communities are an important component of raised bog biodiversity and may be useful as biodiversity indicators, yet they are a neglected area of research.
   3. We address this by surveying night-flying macro-moths on six protected and six degraded raised bogs to establish whether there is a distinct moth fauna associated with the wettest areas of protected sites by comparing them to assemblages found on degraded sites where this wet habitat has been lost.
   4. In general, differences between moth assemblages on protected and degraded raised bogs are rather subtle, with assemblages on both site types generally similar. But, a number of species were found to be associated with protected sites, three of which are bog-associated species of conservation concern and may be particularly vulnerable due to the continuing loss of the wettest areas of raised bogs.
   5. Degraded sites were found to harbour a significant number of bog-associated species of conservation concern and may have a role to play in peatland invertebrate conservation, hitherto undervalued. To determine this, further research is required to describe the invertebrate fauna of these sites and of marginal areas of protected sites.

AB Many peatlands in Europe have been subjected to land reclamation and systematic drainage, which have substantially affected nutrient cycles in the soil. This work reviews published studies on microbial processes linked to carbon and nitrogen transformations in the soils of the Ljubljana marsh, a drained peatland positioned close to Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. This region is known for its dramatic diversity of animal and plant life, but below ground it hides diverse bacterial and archaeal communities that are highly responsive to environmental changes and make the Ljubljana marsh soils a good source of N2O and CO2, and a sink for CH4. Methanogenesis is highly restricted in these soils due to competition for electron donors with iron reducers. In addition, methane is efficiently removed by methanotrophs, which are highly active, especially in the soil layers exposed to the changing water table. Denitrification is limited by electron acceptors and in deeper soil layers also by carbon, which becomes more recalcitrant with depth. Nitrification involves bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidisers with ammonia oxidation rates being among the highest in the world. Interestingly, ammonia-oxidising Thaumarchaeota in acidic bog soils thrive only on ammonia released through mineralisation of organic matter and are incapable of oxidising added mineral ammonia. The soils of the Ljubljana marsh are rich in bacterial laccase-like genes, which may encode enzymes involved in lignin degradation and are therefore interesting for bioexploitations. Future challenges involve designing studies that will reveal specific physiological functions of phenol oxidases and other enzymes involved in peat transformations and address relations between microbial diversity, function and ecosystem responses to anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Stream and wetland-landscape patterns in watersheds that drain active-cranberry bogs, abandoned-cranberry bogs, and forest land with no history of cranberry agriculture were compared at three different levels of detail. Stream-pattern variables included drainage density, sinuosity, and the number, density, and length of ditches. Landscape-pattern measures included wetland-patch structure (the size, shape, and number of wetland patches) and cover-type composition. The results of the stream-pattern analysis indicated that the effect of past and present cranberry agriculture on stream-drainage patterns was limited primarily to the occurrence of ditches. A greater number, density, median length, and total length of ditches were observed in cranberry and abandoned-bog basins compared to forest basins. Drainage density and sinuosity of the remaining non-ditched stream segments did not differ between basin types. Excluding areas of active-cranberry bogs where the native vegetation was removed, there was no significant difference in the relative number, size, shape, and composition of the remaining vegetation-cover types between the three basin types. The exact type and extent of vegetation removed to establish bogs in the active and abandoned basins are not known, but based on soil type and vegetation class associations, it was estimated that the largest losses were of pitch pine lowlands and cedar swamps.

AB The influence of permafrost growth and thaw on the evolution of ice-rich lowland terrain in the Koyukuk-Innoko region of interior Alaska is fundamental but poorly understood. To elucidate this influence, the cryostratigraphy and properties of perennially frozen sediments from three areas in this region are described and interpreted in terms of permafrost history. The upper part of the late Quaternary sediments at the Koyukuk and Innoko Flats comprise frozen organic soils up to 4.5 m thick underlain by ice-rich silt characterised by layered and reticulate cryostructures. The volume of visible segregated ice in silt locally reaches 50 per cent, with ice lenses up to 10 cm thick. A conceptual model of terrain evolution from the Late Pleistocene to the present day identifies four stages of yedoma degradation and five stages of subsequent permafrost aggradation-degradation: (1) partial thawing of the upper ice wedges and the formation of small shallow ponds in the troughs above the wedges; (2) formation of shallow thermokarst lakes above the polygons; (3) deepening of thermokarst lakes and yedoma degradation beneath the lakes; (4) complete thawing of yedoma beneath the lakes; (5) lake drainage; (6) peat accumulation; (7) permafrost aggradation in drained lake basins; (8) formation of permafrost plateaus; and (9) formation and expansion of a new generation of thermokarst features. These stages can occur in differing places and times, creating a highly complex mosaic of terrain conditions, complicating predictions of landscape response to future climatic changes or human impact.

TI Water Table and Vegetation Response to Ditch Blocking: Restoration of a
   Raised Bog in Southwestern British Columbia
SO CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID SPHAGNUM REGENERATION; CUTOVER BOG; PEATLAND; MOISTURE; QUEBEC
AB Large-scale peat harvesting operations alter hydrology of raised bogs so that natural regeneration may not occur without altering the water table. This paper describes efforts to restore key hydrologic and ecologic processes in a southwest BC raised bog (Burns Bog) highly disturbed by decades of peat extraction, drainage, filling, and conversion to agriculture, urban, and industrial uses. The restoration goals are to return a high water table throughout the bog, but particularly in the pine forests at the edge of the bog, to re-establish Sphagnum cover, and to re-start the peat-forming process in degraded peat-harvested sectors. Peripheral and interior ditches are being blocked to increase the retention of winter precipitation into the drier summer months. Piezometer/well measurements have detected water table increases in the past two years, including a relatively immediate response in one site. New Sphagnum colonies have become established in the dry perimeter forest, a first indication that the water table may be rising and that peat-forming vegetation may be responding positively. These preliminary results suggest that it is possible to detect a rapid hydrological response with a comprehensive monitoring net-work in raised bogs; this observation is key to early prediction of future peatland restoration initiatives.

AB Peat plateaus and palsas are characteristic morphologies of sporadic permafrost, and the transition from permafrost to permafrost-free ground typically occurs on spatial scales of meters. They are particularly vulnerable to climate change and are currently degrading in Fennoscandia. Here we present a spatially distributed data set of ground surface temperatures for two peat plateau sites in northern Norway for the year 2015-2016. Based on these data and thermal modeling, we investigate how the snow depth and water balance modulate the climate signal in the ground. We find that mean annual ground surface temperatures are centered around 2 to 2.5 degrees C for stable permafrost locations and 3.5 to 4.5 degrees C for permafrost-free locations. The surface freezing degree days are characterized by a noticeable threshold around 200 degrees C.day, with most permafrost-free locations ranging below this value and most stable permafrost ones above it. Freezing degree day values are well correlated to the March snow cover, although some variability is observed and attributed to the ground moisture level. Indeed, a zero curtain effect is observed on temperature time series for saturated soils during winter, while drained peat plateaus show early freezing surface temperatures. Complementarily, modeling experiments allow identifying a drainage effect that can modify 1-m ground temperatures by up to 2 degrees C between drained and water accumulating simulations for the same snow cover. This effect can set favorable or unfavorable conditions for permafrost stability under the same climate forcing.

AB In the first year's data of the 10th Finnish National Forest Inventory (2005-2008) 533 active and 178 abandoned ant mounds were found yielding 4.2 mounds ha(-1). We found 11 species: Formica rufa, F. polyctena, F. aquilonia, F. lugubris, F pratensis, F. exsecta, F. fennica, F. pressilabris, F. forsslundi, F. suecica and F. uralensis. Five species occurred throughout the country, and four were restricted to the south. We found species-specific associations with either mineral soils or mires, with forest site type and with tree-canopy openness. Low fertility decreased the occurrence of polygynous species with large worker force, and sun-exposition was favourable for species with smaller colonies presumably because only large worker force enables metabolic thermoregulation of nests. Forest fragmentation and increased amount of edge habitats favourable for colony founding have presumably increased nest density whereas drainage of mires has reduced the amount of habitat of three species since the 1950s.

AB The impacts of weed control, ash fertilization and their interaction were tested for the afforestation of former agricultural peat-based soil with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in northern Finland in a factorial arrangement of four treatments. Weed control with herbicides was carried out in July 1 and 2 years from planting, and wood ash (5 Mg ha(-1)) was applied in the spring of the 2nd year. Various vegetation, tree growth and nutrient assessments were made over the 21-year study period. Weed control decreased the weed cover by 36-56 percentage points, vegetation height by 4-26 cm and thus shading of seedlings by vegetation for at least 4 years after planting. For the same period, ash fertilization increased vegetation height by 6-15 cm and shading of seedlings. Weed control reduced seedling mortality by 27 percentage points in 21 years, but ash fertilization had no significant effect. Ash fertilization increased foliar potassium and boron concentrations, but its effect declined, and severe K-deficiency was recorded 21 years after planting. Up to the 9th year, weed control had a greater influence on growth than fertilization. Later the significance of fertilization increased due to an aggravated K-deficiency. Stand volume at year 21 for the untreated control plots was 8 m3 ha(-1). Weed control and fertilization increased stand volume by 20 and 35 m(3)ha(-1), with a combined effect of 55 m(3)ha(-1). The effects of weed control and fertilization were additive and no significant interactions were found. Due to severe K-deficiencies, re-fertilization of all treatments would be necessary for the continued survival and growth of Scots pine.

AB Peatlands on which there is vacuum peat harvesting must be drained to allow peat extraction. Peat erosion due to mechanical filling, vacuum harvest and rain can generate large suspended sediment concentrations that must be reduced before reaching the receiving waters. In this study, six sedimentation basins were monitored over one or two ice-free seasons, resulting in seven basin-years time series, to estimate their trapping efficiency. Using these data, two modelling approaches were first applied to predict the seasonal trapping efficiency of the basins, namely the Brown equation and a multilinear regression model (MLR). Secondly, an additional approach based on the hydrodynamic model MOHID was used to compute the trapping efficiency of one of the basins for a single rain event. The Brown equation, used worldwide in agricultural sedimentation ponds, proved to be less efficient in predicting the trapping efficiency of the basins (r = 0.67, p = 0.1, leave-one-out RMSE = 47.2%) than a MLR model using the volume of the basin, the surface of the harvested catchment and the Von Post decomposition degree of the peat as predictors (r = 0.87, p = 0.01, leave-one-out RMSE = 31.6%). The deterministic MOHID model was capable of reproducing high flow suspended sediment concentration at the basin outlet, based on measured settling velocity distribution of the peat through ViCAs protocol, but requires a good description of the settling velocity distribution across multiple hydrological conditions to simulate the suspended sediment concentrations over a full season in order to compute trapping efficiency. The results presented here provide new insights on eroded peat modelling and could lead to better design formulas for basin conception.

AB We analyzed the testate amoebae communities from two sets of moss samples taken forty years apart ( 1961 and 2001) in the same locations of a peat bog of the Swiss Jura Mountains. Peat Cutting and lateral drainage of Le Cachot bog have caused a clear increase in tree cover, especially near the edges. Changes affecting herbaceous plants, mosses. or soil organisms can be subtle, and may easily be overlooked. We hypothesized that we would see changes in the dominant Sphagnum species and the structure of testate amoebae communities living in the mosses. More specifically, we hypothesized that the frequency of bryophyte and testate amoebae species indicative for dry conditions Would increase and that the frequency of species indicative for wet conditions would decrease. The mean testate amoebae species richness per sample decreased from 11.9 to 9.6, but the overall species richness was identical (33 species) in both years. Three species increased significantly in mean relative abundance: Nebela tincta s.l. (+97 %), Bullinularia indica (+ 810 %), and Cyclopyxis eurystoma (+ 100 %; absent in 1961), while two species decreased significantly: Assulina muscorum (- 63 %) and Euglypha compressa (-93 %). The testate amoebae communities clearly differed among microhabitat types (hummocks, lawns, hollows), but no overall significant change in the community was detectable between the two sampling dates (Mantel test). These results could signify that changes at the microscopic level had already taken place by 1961 and no further overall significant changes in micro-enviromental conditions took place during the 40-year period of this Study. This Would agree with the faster response time usually attributed to microorganisms and would also imply that the bushes and trees may be poor predictors of the response of microorganisms if they are themselves in a non-equilibrium stage. Other possible causes for the lack of overall differences are discussed.

AB The aim of the study was to (1) examine the classification of forest land using airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, satellite images and sample plots of the Finnish National Forest Inventory (NFI) as training data and to (2) identify best performing metrics for classifying forest land attributes. Six different schemes of forest land classification were studied: land use/land cover (LU/LC) classification using both national classes and FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations) classes, main type, site type, peat land type and drainage status. Special interest was to test different ALS-based surface metrics in classification of forest land attributes. Field data consisted of 828 NFI plots collected in 2008-2012 in southern Finland and remotely sensed data was from summer 2010. Multinomial logistic regression was used as the classification method. Classification of LU/LC classes were highly accurate (kappa-values 0.90 and 0.91) but also the classification of site type, peat land type and drainage status succeeded moderately well (kappa-values 0.51, 0.69 and 0.52). ALS-based surface metrics were found to be the most important predictor variables in classification of LU/LC class, main type and drainage status. In best classification models of forest site types both spectral metrics from satellite data and point cloud metrics from ALS were used. In turn, in the classification of peat land types ALS point cloud metrics played the most important role. Results indicated that the prediction of site type and forest land category could be incorporated into stand level forest management inventory system in Finland. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recently in humid tropical Asia, human activities have begun to extend toward the coastal lowland areas where widespread peat swamps are distributed. Draining peat swamp areas for agricultural uses creates a high risk of sulfuric acidification. The research site in this paper was a strand plain comprising beach ridges, swales on inter-ridges, and peaty backswamps in southeast Thailand. Thus, the actual and potential acid sulfate soil in the peaty backswamps is a major problem there, but sandy podzols on older beach ridges are also considered an agricultural problem soil. To establish an agricultural landscape plan encompassing the whole of the strand plain, we studied the land characteristics associated with the landforms and soils, their spatial variability related to landscape evolution, and the status of present plant resources in terms of biomass and species diversity for local farmers on peaty backswamps and beach ridges. We found that all spatial attributes of the two soils, such as the locations, profiles, and chemical and physical properties, were closely related to the geomorphic formation process or chronosequence: the landward or older backswamp has ripe clay and the seaward or younger one partly has unripe clay; the degree of spodic horizon development with ortstein is highest in the most landward beach-ridge system and decreases seaward; and the profile positions of the spodic horizons were related to the fluctuations of marine sand sediments, as revealed in a fine-scale survey. Finding these spatial regularities is useful for predicting land characteristics in areas outside of detailed research sites, reducing time and cost as well as forming the basis of landscape planning. Plant resources presently utilized by local farmers on the strand plain are Melaleuca cajuputi forests on both the peaty backswamps and the beach ridges, and home gardens of tropical fruit trees around settlements. Ecological carrying capacity in terms of biomass of M. cajuputi was not significantly different among soil types in the strand plain, but the growth rate and potential biomass of the species appears to be highest in thick, water-saturated peaty backswamps with acid sulfate soils. By comparing the species composition of home gardens in different areas, we found that oil the beach ridges, although the ecological carrying capacity in terms of biomass for several types of fruit trees appears lower, a great number of species particular to the shrub layer are maintained. Based on the spatial variability of land characteristics and the ecological carrying capacity in terms of biomass, we identified separate land units and suggested future land-management and land-use systems appropriate to each unit.

AB A long-term challenge in managing the climate effects of land use is the development of an efficient, comprehensive approach to the identification of greenhouse gas (GHG) balances. The approach would help in establishing robust methods for the cost-effective and climate-friendly targeting of land use options, for example, in peatlands, which are globally important sinks and sources of GHGs. The aims of this study were to create spatial models with the maximum entropy method Maxent so as to 1) identify the environmental variables that control the distribution of GHG sinks and sources in forestry-drained peatlands in Finland and 2) predict the landscape level distribution of GHG balances in two regional mire complex zones (the aapa mire and the raised bog zone). Several environmental datasets were used as sources of explanatory variables. Even though the significance of the explanatory variables were different between mire complex zones, the variables describing habitat conditions, such as drainage intensity and site fertility, contributed most to the models. Drainage intensity describes indirectly the moisture conditions and can thereby be used as a proxy for the water table. The results showed that relatively coarse-scale environmental data (25 ha grid cells) combined with spatial modelling have potential in explaining and predicting GHG balances at the landscape level: To our knowledge, this is the first time that spatial Maxent models have been used to model the distribution of GHG balances.

AB The use of stable Pb isotopes for tracing Pb contamination within the environment has strongly increased our understanding of the fate of airborne Ph contaminants within the boreal forest. This paper presents new stable Pb isotope (Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio) measurements of solid soil samples, stream water (from a mire outlet and a stream draining a forest dominated catchment) and components of Picea abies (roots, needles and stemwood), and synthesizes some of the authors' recent findings regarding the biogeochemistry of Ph within the boreal forest. The data clearly indicate that the biogeochemical cycling of Pb in the present-day boreal forest ecosystem is dominated by pollution Pb from atmospheric deposition. The Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios of the mor layer (O-horizon), forest plants and stream water (mainly between 1.14 and 1.20) are similar to atmospheric Pb pollution (1.14-1.19), while the local geogenic Pb of the mineral soil (C-horizon) has high ratios (>1.30). Roots and basal stemwood of the analyzed forest trees have higher Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios (1.15-1.30) than needles and apical stemwood (1.14-1.18), which indicate that the latter components are more dominated by pollution derived Pb. The low Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios of the mor layer suggest that the upward transport of Ph as a result of plant uptake is small (<0.04 mg m(-2) a(-1)) in comparison to atmospheric inputs (similar to 0.5 mg m(-2) a(-1)) and annual losses with percolating soil-water (similar to 2 mg m(-2) a(-1)); consequently, the Ph levels in the mor layer are now decreasing while the pool of Pb in the mineral soil is increasing. Streams draining mires appear more strongly affected by pollution Ph than streams from forested catchments, as indicated by Pb concentrations about three times higher and lower Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios (1.16 +/- 0.01 in comparison to 1.18 +/- 0.02). To what extent stream water Pb levels will respond to the build-up of Ph in deeper mineral soil layers remains uncertain. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Reliable high spatial resolution information on the variation of extreme wind speeds under frozen and unfrozen soil conditions can enhance wind damage risk management in forestry. In this study, we aimed to produce spatially detailed estimates for the 10-year return level of maximum wind speeds for frozen (>20 cm frost depth) and unfrozen soil conditions for dense Norway spruce stands on clay or silt soil, Scots pine stands on sandy soil and Scots pine stands on drained peatland throughout Finland. For this purpose, the coarse resolution estimates of the 10-year return levels of maximum wind speeds based on 1979-2014 ERA-Interim reanalysis were downscaled to 20 m grid by using the wind multiplier approach, taking into account the effect of topography and surface roughness. The soil frost depth was estimated using a soil frost model. Results showed that due to a large variability in the timing of annual maximum wind speed, differences in the 10-year return levels of maximum wind speeds between the frozen and unfrozen soil seasons are generally rather small. Larger differences in this study are mostly found in peatlands, where soil frost seasons are notably shorter than in mineral soils. Also, the high resolution of wind multiplier downscaling and consideration of wind direction revealed some larger local scale differences around topographic features like hills and ridgelines.

AB The spatial variability of soil properties plays an important role in water and carbon cycles in peatlands. The objectives of this study were to analyze the spatial variation of hydro-physical properties of peat soils and to establish pedotransfer functions (PTFs) to estimate the hydraulic properties of peat using readily available soil properties. We selected three study sites, each representing a different state of peat degradation (natural, degraded and extremely degraded). At each site, 72 undisturbed soil cores were collected from 5 m by 5 m grid cells in an area of 35 m by 40 m. The saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), soil water retention curves, total porosity, macroporosity (pore diameter >30 mu m), bulk density and soil organic matter content (SOM) were determined for all sampling locations. The Van Genuchten (VG) model parameters (theta(s), alpha, and n) were optimized using the RETC software package. A strong positive correlation between macroporosity and Ks was observed irrespective of the degradation stage of the peat. However, the relationships between macroporosity and Ks differed between the natural and the drained peatlands. Adding macroporosity to the PTFs substantially improves the prediction of K-s as well as VG parameters. Results show that the soil physical and hydraulic properties (e.g. K-s and VG model parameters) exhibit different levels of spatial heterogeneity depending on the peat degradation stage. The geostatistical analysis suggests that the spatial dependence of soil hydro-physical properties varies depending on the considered property as well as land management (e.g. drainage). Bulk density and SOM are spatially dependent, whereas K-s and macroporosity are spatially independent if the peat is severely degraded. In conclusion, the peat degradation stage plays an important role and should be generally considered in the spatial analysis of peatlands. The obtained semivariograms may serve as a basis for 2D and 3D hydrological modelling as well as peatland restoration studies.

AB In drained forest sites, ditch cleaning (DC) may be needed to restore the drainage function of ditches and maintain favourable growing conditions. The main aims of this study were (i) to estimate the growth responses of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) stands following DC, and (ii) to test the hypothesis that stand stocking should be less than 150 m(3) ha(-1) at DC to obtain a growth response. This survey included 14 ditched stands in Sweden on both mineral and peat soils. The methodology was based on evaluating growth rates before and after the DC operation (growth ratio), reconstructing the growth by taking increment cores from the tree trunks. The measured growth was related to growth derived using a growth simulator as if DC had not been conducted. The results showed an average growth increase of 1.6 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1) for about 25 years after DC in the stands containing 50-200 m(3) ha(-1). The growth response appeared to be positively related to stand age, trees ha(-1) and site index, and negatively related to stand volume, supporting the hypothesis that stand stocking is an important factor to consider when assessing the need for DC.

AB The effects of soil compaction on root development in leys were investigated at three locations in northern Norway: Sortland, Tromso and the Pasvik Valley. At these sites, different soil amelioration measures and drainage methods of peat soils had been used. The investigations were carried out in 5-year-old Phleum pratense/Festuca pratensis or P. pratense/Poa pratensis leys. Tractor traffic decreased the maximum root depth at all sites, and the number of roots at 10-25 cm depth in the plough layer. The influence of compaction on root development in the upper 5 cm of the soils varied between the sites. A significant decrease was found for all compaction treatments at the Pasvik Valley, whereas only the heaviest compaction, with the use of double rear wheels, caused a significantly decreased number of roots in the upper 5 cm of the soil at Sortland. Soil compaction significantly decreased the infiltration rate at all sites. A significant positive correlation was found between infiltration rate and air-filled porosity.

AB The main aim of this study was to determine, during extreme hydrological conditions, the source(s) of acids, sulphate and metals (alkali and alkaline earths) in the Munsala stream (western Finland) draining mainly acid sulphate soil, peat and till. Samples were collected at 6 sites along the main stem on 3 high-flow and 3 low-flow events, and were analysed for the required chemical and isotopic variables. The acid sulphate soils (located under farmland) had a large impact on the stream as indicated by pH values occasionally down to 4.0, moderately to strongly increased concentrations of inorganic solutes, and a high acid SO42- load characterised by negative delta(34)S((sulphat)) values. In addition, the forested areas underlain mainly with till and peat released low SO42- but low pH waters (down to at least 4.6) during high flows, indicating the importance of humic acids in controlling the pH. These humic acids flocculated abundantly in the middle/lower reaches as a result of interaction with acid sulphate water. Therefore, not only the farmland acid sulphate soils but also the organic-rich soils/horizons in the forested areas contribute to water-quality deterioration.

AB Moose Alces alces is abundant throughout the boreal zone. However, in the landscapes occupied by moose the density of predators and human influence often vary considerably, as do the arrival of spring and phenology of vegetation - all crucial factors for moose, especially during their calving period.
   During calving, female moose are faced with a dilemma between choosing a habitat offering high quality forage or one offering protection for the vulnerable calf. This study examined the timing of calving and habitat structure of female moose during and after calving in two areas of Finland with different predator and human densities. Data from 14 GPS-collared moose were integrated with data on landscape composition and forest structure from airborne Lidar.
   In both study areas, calves were born in May and mostly in drained forests (with ditches) on peatland soils. After giving birth, females in the more human-influenced landscape moved to more fertile forests on mineral soils, whereas the females in the landscape with little human influence stayed mostly on the drained and pine-dominated peatland forests, which also had less shrub vegetation. Moose were also seen giving birth near human settlements (farms) and staying close to them (<500 m) throughout summer. Thus, females in both study areas illustrated a high degree of adaptability by selecting the highly modified drained landscapes or areas near humans for calving sites over other available landscapes.

AB Reed canary grass (RCG, Phalaris arundinacea L.) is a suitable energy crop for cultivation in northern peatlands. However, the atmospheric impact of RCG cultivation as influenced by harvest frequency and fertilization is not clear. Here, we compared the biomass yield and greenhouse gas (GHG) balance for RCG cultivation in peatlands affected by cutting frequency and fertilizer managements. The managements included one-cut (OC) and two-cut (TC) systems that were either fertilized (TC-F) or unfertilized (TC-U) after the first cut in summer. Biomass yield of OC, TC-F and TC-U were 12, 16 and 11 Mg dry biomass per hectare per year, respectively. GHG fluxes of CO2, N2O and CH4 were measured with closed chamber techniques in the period between first and second (final) harvest of the TC managements, i.e. from 15 June to 23 September 2011. In the GHG monitoring period of 100 days, all systems were net sources of CO2 corresponding to 64 +/- 3, 217 +/- 15 and 50 +/- 23 g CO2-C m(-2) (mean +/- standard error, n = 3) from the OC, TC-F and TC-U systems, respectively. In the same period, emissions of N2O from TC-F were ten times higher as compared to OC and TC-U. Emissions of CH4 were negligible from all systems. The TC systems could not improve the GHG balance during cultivation (271, 663 and 210 g CO(2)e-C m(-2) emissions from the OC, TC-F and TC-U systems, respectively), but in a broader GHG life cycle perspective, the increased biomass yield by TC-F could replace more fossil fuel and offset at least some of the higher emissions from the system.

AB The sustainability argument that more peat grows in Finland than is used does not hold. On designated peatlands, growth is about 85 times slower than peat use; growth elsewhere in Finland does not add to available resources. Claiming undisturbed peatlands as carbon sinks for sustainable peat use is also misleading as anthropogenic carbon sources require additional sinks, not natural ones. Undisturbed peatlands usually emit significant quantities of methane. About 57 000 km(2) of forestry drained peatlands now have effectively stopped emitting methane, and temporarily accumulate more carbon annually than earlier. These greenhouse reducing aspects are only modestly compensated or 'used' by emissions from peat used for energy. However, as forests mature and the peat underneath continues to oxidise, the new carbon sink will eventually turn into a carbon source. Multiple claims of this very same anthropogenic carbon sink (perhaps by the peat, paper and timber industry), i.e. double counting, may be avoided by certifying these sinks. After peat harvesting (liberating in the order of 375 kg atmospheric carbon per m(2)), wood in a production/harvest cycle may be grown (at 0.1 kgC/m(2) per a) on the now available area, as a renewable energy source. These numbers indicate the slow rate at which these cycles, that are in principle carbon neutral in themselves, help compensate for the carbon emissions from the earlier use of peat by avoiding the emissions of fossil fuels otherwise used.

AB Combination of rewetting and wetland crop cultivation (paludiculture) is pursued as a wider carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation option in drained peatland. However, information on the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) balance for paludiculture is lacking. We investigated the GHG balance of peatlands grown with reed canary grass (RCG) and rewetted to various extents.
   Gas fluxes of CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured with a static chamber technique for 10 months from mesocosms sown with RCG and manipulated to ground water levels (GWL) of 0, -10, -20, -30 and -40 cm below the soil surface. Gross primary production (GPP) was estimated from the above ground biomass yield.
   The mean dry biomass yield across all water table treatments was 6 Mg ha(-1) with no significant differences between the treatments. Raising the GWL to the surface decreased both the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and N2O emissions whereas CH4 emissions increased. Total cumulative GHG emissions (for 10 months) corresponded to 0.08, 0.13, 0.61, 0.68 and 0.98 kg CO2 equivalents m(-2) from the GWL treatments at 0, -10, -20, -30 and -40 cm below the soil surface, respectively.
   The results showed that a reduction in total GHG emission can be achieved without losing the productivity of newly established RCG when GWL is maintained close to the surface. Further studies should address the practical constrains and long-term productivity of RCG cultivation in rewetted peatlands.

AB The majority of peatlands in the temperate zone is subjected to drainage and agricultural land use and have been found to be anthropogenic emission hot spots for greenhouse gases. At the same time, many peatlands receive increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition by intensive agricultural practices. Here we provide eddy covariance measurements determining net ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange at a protected but moderately drained ombrotrophic bog in Northwestern Germany over three consecutive years. The region is dominated by intensive agricultural land use with total (wet and dry) atmospheric N deposition being about 25kgNha(-1)yr(-1). The investigated peat bog was a small net CO2 sink during all three years ranging from -9 to -73gCm(-2)yr(-1). We found temperature- and light-dependent ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross primary production, respectively, but only weak correlations to water table depths despite large interannual and seasonal variability. Significant short-term effects of atmospheric N deposition on CO2 flux components could not be observed, as the primary controlling factors for N deposition and C sequestration, i.e., fertilization of adjacent fields as well as temperature and light availability, respectively, exceeded potential interactions between the two.

AB Nitrogen additions as NH4NO3 corresponding to 0 (N0), 1 (N1), 3 (N3) and 10 (N10) g N m(-2) yr(-1) were made to Sphagnum magellanicum cores at two-week intervals in situ at four sites across Europe, i.e. Lakkasuo (Finland), Mannikjarve (Estonia), Moidach More (UK) and Cote de Braveix (France). The same treatments were applied in a glasshouse experiment in Neuchatel (Switzerland) in which the water table depth was artificially maintained at 7, 17 and 37 cm below the moss surface. In the held, N assimilation in excess of values in wet deposition occurred in the absence of growth, but varied widely between sites, being absent in Lakkasuo (moss N:P ratio 68) and greatest in Moidach More (N:P 21). In the glasshouse, growth was reduced by lowering the water table without any apparent effect on N assimilation. Total N content of the moss in field sites increased as the mean depth of water table increased indicating growth limitation leading to increased N concentrations which could reduce the capacity for N retention. Greater contents of NH4+ in the underlying peat at 30 cm depth, both in response to NH4NO3 addition and in the unamended cores confirmed poor retention of inorganic N by the moss at Lakkasuo. Nitrate contents in the profiles at Lakkasuo, Moidach More, and Cote de Braveix were extremely low, even in the N10 treatment, but in Mannikjarve, where the mean depth of water table was greatest and retention absent, appreciable amounts of NO3- were detected in all cores. It is concluded that peatland drainage would reduce the capture of inorganic N in atmospheric deposition by Sphagnum mosses.

AB In this study, microcosms were used to investigate the influence of temperature (4 and 28 degrees C) and water content (45% and 90% WHC) on microbial communities and activities in carbon-rich fen soil. Bacterial, archaeal and denitrifier community composition was assessed during incubation of microcosms for 12 weeks using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiling of 16S rRNA and nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) genes. In addition, microbial and denitrifier abundance, potential denitrification activity and production of greenhouse gases were measured. No detectable changes were observed in prokaryote or denitrifier abundance. In general, cumulatively after 12 weeks more carbon was respired at the higher temperature (3.7 mg CO2 g(-1) soil), irrespective of the water content, whereas nitrous oxide production was greater under wet conditions (98-336 mu g N2O g(-1) soil). After an initial lag phase, methane emissions (963 mu g CH4 g(-1) soil) were observed only under warm and wet conditions. T-RFLP analyses of bacterial 16S rRNA and nosZ genes revealed small or undetectable community changes in response to temperature and water content, suggesting that bacterial and denitrifying microbial communities are stable and do not respond significantly to seasonal changes in soil conditions. In contrast, archaeal microbial community structure was more dynamic and was strongly influenced by temperature.

AB The geochemical characteristics of peats and regularities in the distribution of mineral components have been studied in pent deposits in the Altai piedmont. These regularities depend on a number of factors including the closeness of the studied deposits to source areas, the petrographic compositions of rooks in these areas, the geomorphologic position of drainage systems and peat deposits, the amount of a mineral substance input, acid the intensity of postsedimentation processes. For the first time, we have traced regularities of gold transformation in peats and revealed a trend of gold accumulation caused by diagenetic alterations. It was shown that element concentrations in peats exceeding clarkes could he used as a criterion for prospecting ore accumulations in source areas. The use of systems analysis for establishing the genetic nature of minerals allows us to trace mineral-formation processes at various stages of sedimentation and diagenesis and assess the possibility of discovering ore formation products.

ID ATTAWAPISKAT RIVER; BAY LOWLAND; GROUNDWATER
AB Pliocene glaciations, post-glacial Tyrrell Sea deposition, peatland formation, and continuous isostatic uplift have created a unique environment for karst development on the Paleozoic carbonate rocks within the James Bay Lowland of Canada. Four types of sinkhole and two karst hydrogeological systems have been recognized in the study area. The hydrogeologically active karst system consists of solution sinkholes, solutionally enlarged fractures, and collapse sinkholes that have developed after the area emerged from the Tyrrell Sea approximately 4400 years ago. The active karst system encompasses the exposed reefal limestone of the Silurian Attawapiskat Formation along the Attawapiskat River and Nayshkootayaow River and isolated bioherms that protrude above the surrounding flat but poorly drained peatland between the two major rivers. The second karst system is in the form of paleokarst formed in the underlying limestone but buried beneath the peat and marine sediments. Although these buried sinkholes were only visible at excavation sites where these features were exposed, it is likely that they underlie most of the study area. Another form of paleokarst is the Bedrock Trench that cut through most of the Paleozoic formation to a depth of approximately 200 m. The bedrock trench encompassed an area of more than 3 km(2), was filled with unconsolidated materials, and did not have strong hydraulic connections to the active karst system. Formation mechanism of this bedrock trench is inconclusive but may result from polygenetic processes including glacial scouring and bedrock dissolution. Recognition of these two karst systems helps understand potential hydrogeological changes in response to continuous isostatic uplift and dewatering activities in this region.

AB Globally, peatlands are under threat from a range of land use related factors that have a significant impact on the provision of ecosystem services, such as biodiversity and carbon (C) sequestration/storage. In Ireland, approximately 84% of raised bogs (a priority habitat listed in Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive) have been affected by peat extraction. While restoration implies the return of ecosystem services that were characteristic of the pre-disturbed ecosystem, achieving this goal is often a challenge in degraded peatlands as post-drainage conditions vary considerably between sites. Here, we present multi-year greenhouse gas (GHG) and vegetation dynamics data from two former raised bogs in Ireland that were drained and either industrially extracted (milled) or cut on the margins for domestic use and subsequently rewetted (with no further management). When upscaled to the ecosystem level, the rewetted nutrient poor domestic cutover peatland was a net sink of carbon dioxide (CO2) (-49 +/- 66 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) and a source of methane (CH4) (19.7 +/- 5 g Cm-2 yr(-1)), while the nutrient rich industrial cutaway was a net source of CO2 (0.66 +/- 168 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) and CH4 (5.0 +/- 2.2 g Cm-2 yr(-1)). The rewetted domestic cutover site exhibited the expected range of micro-habitats and species composition found in natural (non-degraded) counterparts. In contrast, despite successful rewetting, the industrially extracted peatland did not exhibit typical raised bog flora. This study demonstrated that environmental and management variables can influence species composition and, therefore, the regeneration of species typical of natural sites, and has highlighted the climate benefits from rewetting degraded peatlands in terms of reduced GHG emissions. However, rewetting of degraded peatlands is a major challenge and in some cases reintroduction of bryophytes typical of natural raised bogs may be more difficult than the achievement of proper GHG emission savings.

AB As natural sources of methane (CH4), peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Climate models predict that evapotranspiration will increase under a 2 x CO2 scenario due to increased temperatures leading to lowered water tables at many northern latitudes. Given that the position of the water table within a peatland can have a large effect on CH4 emissions, climate change may alter the CH4 emissions from peatlands in this area. Research was conducted during 2001-2003 on natural and drained (8 years prior) sites within a poor fen in central Quebec. Flux measurements were made for each site at different microtopographical features that varied in depth to water table and vegetation cover. The quantity of CH4 dissolved in the pore water was measured in the field and the potential of the peat for CH4 production and consumption was determined in the laboratory. Methane emissions and storage were lower in the drained fen. Growing season CH4 emissions at the drained site were 55% lower than the control site, primarily due to significantly reduced fluxes from topographic highs (up to 97% reduction), while the flux from topographically low areas remained high. The maintenance of high fluxes at these hollow sites was related to hydrological and ecological effects of the water table drawdown. The removal of standing water removed a potential zone of CH4 oxidation. It also enabled plant colonization at these locations, leading to an increase in gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP). At the hollow sites, seasonal CH4 emissions were significantly correlated to seasonal GEP (R-2 = 0.85). These results suggest that the response of northern peatland CH4 dynamics to climate change depends on the antecedent moisture conditions of the site. Moreover, ecological succession can play an important role for determining future CH4 emissions, particularly from wetter sites.

AB The hydraulic conductivity (K) of peat beneath the water table varies over short (annual) periods. Biogenic gas bubbles block pores and reduce K, and seasonal changes in the water table position cause peat deformation, altering peat pore size distribution. Although it has been hypothesized that both processes reduce K during warm dry summer conditions, temporal variations in K under field conditions have been explained previously by peat volume changes (strain) alone. We determine the effect of both controls on K by monitoring changes in gas content (), strain and K within a poor fen. Over the growing season, K decreased by an order of magnitude. In the near-surface peat (0.3-0.7m), this reduction is more strongly correlated with , providing the first field-based evidence that biogenic gas bubbles reduce K. In the deeper peat (0.7-1.3m), K is correlated principally with strain. However, causality is uncertain because of multicollinearity between strain and . To mitigate for multicollinearity, we took advantage of a peatland drainage experiment where the water table was artificially dropped at the beginning of the growing season, reducing correlations between strain and . remained the primary cause of K variations just beneath the water table at a depth of 0.5-0.7m, although further down through the peat profile (0.7-1.2m) changes in K were controlled by strain. We suggest that the larger pore structure of the poorly decomposed peat just below the water table is impacted less by volume changes than that of the more decomposed peat at depth. However, within this poorly decomposed peat, K is reduced by the high gas contents that result from higher rates of methane production. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Drained organic soils are among the most risky soil types as far as their greenhouse gas emissions are considered. Reed canary grass (RCG) is a potential bioenergy crop in the boreal region, but the atmospheric impact of its cultivation is unknown. The fluxes of N2O and CH4 were measured from an abandoned peat extraction site (an organic soil) cultivated with RCG using static chamber and snow gradient techniques. The fluxes were measured also at an adjacent site which is under active peat extraction and it is devoid of any vegetation (BP site). The 4-year average annual N2O emissions were low being 0.1 and 0.01 g N2O m(-2) a(-1) at the RCG and BP sites, respectively. The corresponding mean annual CH4 emissions from the RCG and BP sites were also low (0.4 g and 0.9 g CH4 m(-2) a(-1)). These results highlight for the first time that there are organic soils where cultivation of perennial bioenergy crops is possible with low N2O and CH4 emissions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Restoration of endangered fen communities: the ambiguity of

AB 1. Low phosphorus (P) availability limits plant biomass production in fens, which is a prerequisite for the persistence of many endangered plant species. We hypothesized that P limitation is linked to soil iron (Fe) content and soil Fe : P ratios as iron compounds provide binding sites for dissolved P, presumably reducing P availability to plants.
   2. We sampled 30 fens in a trans-European field survey to determine how soil Fe pools relate to pools of P and Fe-bound P, and we measured vegetation P uptake and N : P ratio to assess where P limitation occurs. Next, we determined P uptake by Carex rostrata in experimental fen mesocosms to investigate interactive effects of soil Fe and P pools (and fractions) and water levels (drained or rewetted).
   3. The field survey revealed that soil P pools correlate positively with soil Fe pools, regardless of fen degradation level, location or sampling depth. Moreover, soil Fe and P pools correlated positively with P uptake by the vegetation and negatively with vegetation N : P ratios. Generally, N : P ratios dropped below 10 g g(-1) whenever thresholds of 15 mmol Fe L-1 soil and 3.3 mmol P L-1 soil were exceeded. Endangered fen species mainly thrived in Fe- (and thus P-) poor fens.
   4. The mesocosm experiment further showed that interactions between water levels and P pools determined plant P uptake: although fen rewetting led to an overall increase in P uptake, plants that had grown on drained Fe-rich soils with large acid-extractable P pools (> 1.6 mmol Pacid L-1) could still sequester large quantities of P. Soil Fe : P ratio had no effect on P uptake.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings have important implications for the management and restoration of endangered fen communities. We demonstrated the existence of an ironphosphorus (Fe-P) binding ambiguity in fens: large Fe pools 'trap' mobile P, thereby enhancing overall P availability to plants rather than diminishing it. For P limitation, we suggest an empirical threshold of < 3.3 mmol P L-1 soil, which is mainly found in Fe-poor fens. Restoring fens by rewetting increases the relative availability of P and may not always result in favourable conditions for endangered fen communities. Rewetting of drained fens is most likely to be successful if soil P and Fe pools are well below 3.3 and 15 mmol L-1 respectively.

AB Blanket bogs contain vast amounts of Sphagnum-derived organic substances which can act as powerful chelators for dissolved iron and thus enhance its export to the coastal ocean. To investigate the variations in quantity and quality of these exports, adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (CSV) was used to characterize the metal binding properties of molecular weight-fractionated dissolved organic matter (MW-fractionated DOM) in the catchment and coastal plume of a small peat-draining river over a seasonal cycle. Within the plume, both iron-and copper-binding organic ligands showed a linear, conservative distribution with increasing salinity, illustrating the high stability of peatland-derived humic substances (HS). Within the catchment, humic colloids lost up to 50% of their copper-binding capacity, expressed as a molar ratio to organic carbon, after residing for 1 week or more in the main reservoir of the catchment. Immediately downstream of the reservoir, the molar ratio [L-2]/[C-org] where L-2 was the second strongest copper-binding ligand, was 0.75 x 10(-4) when the reservoir residence time was 5 h but 0.34 x 10(-4) when it was 25 days. Residence time did not affect the carbon specific iron-binding capacity of the humic substances which was [L]/[C-org] = (0.80 +/- 0.20) x 10(-2). Our results suggest that the loss of copper-binding capacity with increasing residence time is caused by intracolloidal interactions between iron and HS during transit from peat soil to river mouth.

AB The Stockton coal bed (Middle Pennsylvanian) is a relatively high ash coal composed primarily of moderately thin banded, sparsely thin banded, and nonbanded coal (splint and cannel coal). Comparisons of petrographic, palynologic, and paleobotanic data gathered from the same sample sets from a single column of the Stockton coal bed indicate that compositional correspondences among the sets exist regardless of coal type. Some correspondences are believed to exist because of original plant constituents and others because of the paleoenvironment of peat formation. Using some combination of these data is critical when interpreting paleoenvironmental conditions because (1) a direct correspondence is lacking between many of the data and (2) each of the three data sets provides a unique and important perspective on the paleomire. The Stockton paleomire in the area of this study supported a diverse flora that consisted of both small and arboreous lycopsids, small ferns and tree ferns, calamites, cordaites, and pteridosperms. There appear to have been two successions of Lycospora spore-dominated, vitrinite-rich, liptinite-poor peat formation, which were followed by inertinite-rich peat formation marked by a tree fem-dominant spore assemblage and abundant unidentifiable plant tissues. These are interpreted to be two water-laden or topogenous peat formational stages followed by slightly domed, better drained peat formation.

Three growing seasons later there were no responses in injected trees in tree height increment, foliage nutrient levels of N, P, K, Ca, needle colour, needle weight or crown density. Foliage Mg levels were raised significantly. The injection procedure caused severe tissue damage around the infusion point and 84 per cent of the trees had stain in stem cross sections 50 cm above the treatment location.

AB The Holocene pear areas in the Province of Friesland consisting of peat and clay deposits are used extensively for agriculture and are drained by maintaining a low surface water level in polder ditches. Considerable rates of land subsidence (1 to 12mm/year) result from processes such as soil shrinkage, consolidation and peat oxidation, the last named being the major contributor.
   In the Province of Friesland studies of the future effects of continuous long-term land subsidence have been made as part of the hydrological masterplan. For these studies the Geological Survey of The Netherlands (RGD) has compiled maps showing the estimated subsidence over a 50-year period for three scenarios of freeboard (difference in elevation between surface water level and the ground surface). Data sources consist of recent ground surface levels measured for the construction of utility lines, to be used for the transport of water, gas or sewage, earlier topographical maps, historical surface water level records and soil profiles.
   Maximum estimates for rates of subsidence for peat with and without clay cover have been established by evaluation of the data with subsequent subsidence process analysis for various situations of drainage, duration of drainage, soil and hydrological conditions. Three maps showing the estimated land subsidence over a 50-year period for freeboards of 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 m have been compiled using a two-dimensional Geographical Information System (2D-GIS), coupled with the RGD database, and have been presented in 1 km(2) grids. A comprehensive map of estimated land subsidence is being compiled by the Province, taking into account the actual freeboards at each location. The presented study forms a new approach to the estimation of future land subsidence in peat areas on a regional scale.

AB Studies on greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted by hydroelectric reservoirs have shown until now that the fate of carbon, following impoundment, seems to reach the fate of carbon in natural aquatic ecosystems after a decade or so. To adequately assess this assumption and then obtain the net GHG emissions from the Eastmain-1 hydroelectric reservoir, the carbon stock and GHG emissions from peatlands and different succession stages of forested areas need to be characterized prior to the reservoir impoundment. It is therefore important to characterize the carbon flow process (surface fluxes and sequestrated carbon) from these terrestrial systems prior to impoundment. The Canadian Wildlife Service of Environment Canada, Quebec region, has developed an approach for mapping wetlands using Landsat/RADARSAT-1 satellite images. The method is based on image segmentation using the Definiens Professional software. The top-down object-based classification is based on the Canadian Wetland Classification System and quickly and precisely identifies ecologically meaningful wetland polygons. The main objective of this study is to produce a wetland map of the Eastmain River watershed using a SPOT-4 image aimed at identifying five classes of wetlands (bog, fen, marsh, swamp, shallow water) for a geographical unit of at least 1 ha, and to add to the peatland classes a description of their components, such as pool complexes and vegetation structures, to assign measured carbon values to these different peatland classes and scale up the data to obtain a regional carbon budget. The second objective of the study consists in determining whether SPOT-4 images can be used to map wetlands, using the object-based method developed with Landsat/RADARSAT-1 images, and if a finer spatial resolution would improve the wetland mapping results by adding information on wetland components. The SPOT-4 classification using the object-based method allowed the five main wetland classes to be identified in addition to pool complexes in three density classes (isolated, low density, and high density) and "bogs"/"fens" vegetation structure (treed or open) in peatland classes. Validation was done at two levels: (i) between the five classes of wetlands, and (ii) between pool complexes and vegetation structures. The overall accuracy was 81% for the first level and 75% for the second.

AB Monitoring peatland restoration can be labour intensive, and monitoring activities can result in further disturbance, suggesting that remote sensing can play an important role in assessing ecosystem responses to restoration efforts. In this study, we assessed the response of plant phenological parameters for Burns Bog, a highly disturbed peatland in Western Canada, to restoration efforts. We evaluated the potential for rewetting of disturbed areas to reverse impacts from prior drainage by assessing hydroclimatic controls of precipitation and water table height fluctuations in concert with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and evapotranspiration (ET) parameters obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer platform. Three transects, at different stages of rewetting were used in this study: a control transect with undisturbed native bog vegetation, and transects over disturbed areas with rewetting efforts begun in 2001 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, impacts from a fire event occurring in one of the rewetted transects were investigated. Results showed that rewetting was an efficient restoration procedure for Burns Bog, with both water table height and peat coverage increasing in the rewetted areas. Both rewetted transects are exhibiting characteristics in line with increased Sphagnum coverage in response to rewetting, with NDVI values ranging from 0.5 during the wet season to 0.9 during the growing season and with ET around 450mm y(-1). Additionally, changes in NDVI and ET were strongly correlated to precipitation, temperature and the change in water table height at each transect. We found that NDVI was more effective than ET for investigating the impacts of disturbance events (e.g., fires in the bog), whereas ET provided a better index to monitor the ecohydrological functioning of the bog in response to restoration efforts.

AB Radiocarbon dating and analyses of fossils contained in peat cliffs establish the history of peatland formation and development at the northern edge of Point Escuminac, New Brunswick. A 532 cm radiocarbon-dated mineral sediment and peat sequence, the oldest of four sections studied, yielded pollen and macrofossils that record bog development from 11 000 BP. The earliest landscape was open Juniperus shrubland. Picea was the first tree to move into the area, forming woodland communities by 10 200 BP and closed coniferous forests with Abies by 9200 BP. An early counterpart of the modem Acadian forests was in place by 6500 BP and was fully developed by 2900 BP when Fagus spread through the area. Shallow freshwater, open wetland communities acted as nuclei for the development of fen near the centre of the peninsula. Transformation into an ombrotrophic bog started around 6500 BP and was completed by 4700 BP, after which time the bog spread laterally by paludification onto higher parts of the peninsula.

AB Fens and bogs are distinct in terms of their biogeochemistry, water table behavior, and net peat-accumulation regimes. While most peatlands start developing as fens, a large fraction of them eventually shift to bogs in a step-like ecosystem shift. This transition has traditionally been assumed to be primarily controlled by the ecosystem itself (autogenic control). Here we use 90 peat profiles from southernmost South America (SSA) as a case study that illustrates a synchronous, regional-scale shift from fen to bog around 4200 years ago. In light of these results, we propose and discuss conceptual models that link environmental change (allogenic control) as a trigger to the fen-bog transition (FBT). In addition, our stratigraphic analyses show thatSphagnumdeposits are associated with greater peat masses, larger soil-carbon stocks, and higher rates of peat-carbon accumulation than their non-Sphagnumcounterparts, withSphagnumbogs being characterized by soil-carbon densities over twice that of non-Sphagnumpeatlands (medians = 141 vs. 56 kgC/m(2)). Since fens and bogs also behave differently in terms of their carbon exchanges with the atmosphere, a better appraisal of the processes involved in the FBT could help elucidate the role of this critical ecosystem shift in the past and future global carbon cycle.

AB This study shows that chemical properties of two restiad species, Empodisma minus and Sporadanthus traversii, may contribute to their success as peat-formers in a climate of the North Island of New Zealand which is not conducive to raised mire development. Unlike Sphagnum, the equivalent northern hemisphere peat-former, restiads possess lignin in their tissues. In addition, the presence of non-lignin polyphenols (including tannins and phenolic acids) in restiads may be an important factor in peat formation due to the allelopathic decay retardation. Patterns of degradation of plant biopolymers have been examined and the pathway of degradation of monocotyledons (loss of non-lignin phenolic fraction, depolymerization via modification of side chains of beta-O-4 lignin, depletion of hemicelluloses) was identified. Trends in chemical change far lignin were not necessarily paralleled by a similar change in the degree of plant structure preservation-an expression of a complex nature of degradation involving the contributions of several processes affecting different classes of biopolymers to different extents. A further finding of this study is that the degree of lignin breakdown, together with proportions of fungal hyphae and petrographic character, indicate that one of the two bogs studied, Moanatuatua, has undergone far more aerobic decay throughout its development than has its climatic and vegetational equivalent, Kopouatai. This is thought to be due to differing water tables in the two sedimentary environments. Moanatuatua developed in a flood plain distant from the sea with a migrating river system, while Kopouatai developed near the sea. A high degree of natural pest decomposition at Moanatuatua most probably precluded any further rapid decay after recent agricultural drainage. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated communities of oribatid mites in five peat bogs in the north-west of the East European plain. We aimed to determine the extent to which geographic factors (latitude, separation distance), local environment (Sphagnum moss species, ground water level, biogeochemistry) and local habitat complexity (diversity of vascular plants and bryophytes in the surrounding plant community) influence diversity and community composition of Oribatida. There was a significant north-to-south increase in Oribatida abundance. In the variance partitioning, spatial factors explained 33.1 % of variability in abundance across samples; none of the environmental factors were significant. Across all bogs, Oribatida species richness and community composition were similar in Sphagnum rubellum and Sphagnum magellanicum, but significantly different and less diverse in Sphagnum cuspidatum. Sphagnum microhabitat explained 52.2 % of variability in Oribatida species richness, whereas spatial variables explained only 8.7 %. There was no distance decay in community similarity between bogs with increased geographical distance. The environmental variables explained 34.9 % of the variance in community structure, with vascular plants diversity, bryophytes diversity, and ground water level all contributing significantly; spatial variables explained 15.1 % of the total variance. Overall, only 50 % of the Oribatida community variance was explained by the spatial structure and environmental variables. We discuss relative importance of spatial and local environmental factors, and make general inferences about the formation of fauna in Sphagnum bogs.

AB Calcareous fens are minerotrophic peatlands with very high species diversity, and maintenance of the water table is assumed to be a key contributor to this diversity. However, this assumption is based on limited study of fen water table dynamics. Here we monitor water table fluctuation in distributed locations across three calcareous fens differing in hydrogeomorphic setting for three growing seasons. Water table position was extremely variable with absolute ranges of 89, > 100, and > 118 cm in the Riparian, Trough and Basin Fens, respectively, and was controlled by landscape position and weather variability. Areas adjacent to a second-order stream experienced the least water table fluctuation, while the Basin Fen, at > 75 m from a surface water connection, was very prone to year-to-year precipitation differences. Mean and median water table values were found to be poor indicators of biologically relevant hydroperiods. We introduce the term duration of initial growing season saturation as a potentially more useful statistic to relate to plant species distribution. Across the studied fens, this duration ranged from 1 to 14 weeks from the start of the growing season. The water table resided below the ground surface for between 0 and 22 weeks of the growing season across the calcareous fens and study period. These findings impart great differences in the development of oxidized rooting depths. Our results demonstrate that there is much more variation in calcareous fen hydrology than previously reported, and this variability has important implications for fen vegetation patterning and management.

AB Drainage of peatlands for forestry starts a succession of ground vegetation in which mire species are gradually replaced by forest species. Some mire plant communities vanish quickly following the water-level drawdown; some may prevail longer in the moister patches of peatland. Drainage ditches, as a new kind of surface, introduce another component of spatial variation in drained peatlands. These variations were hypothesized to affect methane (CH(4)) fluxes from drained peatlands. Methane fluxes from different plant communities and unvegetated surfaces, including ditches, were measured at the drained part of Lakkasuo mire, Central Finland. The fluxes were found to be related to peatland site type, plant community, water-table position and soil temperature. At nutrient-rich fen sites fluxes between plant communities differed only a little: almost all plots acted as CH(4) sinks (-0.9 to -0.4 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1)), with the exception of Eriophorum angustifolium Honck. communities, which emitted 0.9 g CH(4) m(-2) stop d(-1). At nutrient-poor bog site the differences between plant communities were clearer. The highest emissions were measured from Eriophorum vaginatum L. communities (29.7 mg CH(4) m(-2) stop d(-1)), with a decreasing trend to Sphagna (10.0 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1)supercript stop) and forest moss communities (2.6 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1)). CH(4) emissions from different kinds of ditches were highly variable, and extremely high emissions (summertime averages 182-600 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1) stop) were measured from continuously water-covered ditches at the drained fen. Variability in the emissions was caused by differences in the origin and movement of water in the ditches, as well as differences in vegetation communities in the ditches. While drainage on average greatly decreases CH(4) emissions from peatlands, a great spatial variability in fluxes is emerged. Emissions from ditches constantly covered with water, may in some cases have a great impact on the overall CH(4) emissions from drained peatlands.

AB The Rejviz bog is an extensive mire complex in Central Europe, with up to 7 m deep sediments and two natural lakes. Recent vegetation is one of the best preserved examples of Pious uncinata subsp. uliginosa (syn. P rotundata) bog woodland in Central Europe. The origin and development of the mire and changes in the surrounding landscape vegetation are reconstructed using sediment stratigraphy, radiocarbon dating, pollen analysis and plant-macrofossils analysis, with particular emphasis on the processes that resulted in the origin of Rejviz bog and on pine woodland dynamics. Based on identified species the water level changes were reconstructed. The sediment started to accumulate more than 9000 years ago at an open mixed-woodland spring with Dichodontium palustre. Later, poor fen vegetation with sedges and horsetails developed. Around 6170 cal. yr BC the fen became inundated for 2000 years and (semi)aquatic vegetation thrived. Next step in the succession followed a decline in water level which resulted in the development of drier oligothrophic vegetation with a high representation of pine and dwarf shrubs. After ca 1020 cal. yr BC the mire became the bog it is now. Three wooded stages appeared in both the minerotrophic and ombrotrophic developmental phases: before 6720 cal. yr BC, during ca 1960-1020 cal. yr BC and recently. The vegetation in the surrounding landscape developed without marked human interventions up till ca the last six or five centuries, when deforestation and later settlement took place. Comparison with published data from the Gory Bystrzyckie/Orlicke hory Mu suggests that not only regional, but also local vegetation changed in a similar way across the middle-altitude eastern Sudetes, following oscillations in climate rather than local changes in mire water regime.

ID STREAMS
AB Vegetation change was documented along three permanent transects after nearly three decades of beaver flooding. The anchored forested wetland community was killed and replaced by a minerotrophic fen vegetation, whereas minimal change occurred within the tall scrub-shrub, dwarf shrub and open meadow communities. Along all transects, tree cover was reduced two- to five-fold, whereas low heath shrub cover, especially Chamaedaphne calyculata and Kalmia angustifolia, increased. Herbaceous cover, primarily sedges, increased, especially in the newly created fen. Within the floating mat communities the evergreen ericaceous shrubs and scattered stunted Picea mariana and Larix laricina persisted as did the herbaceous bog flora. Species richness showed little change from 1960-1988 although there was a floristic shift toward more hydric species. Flooding differentially affected the vegetation pattern favoring more minerotrophic species in some areas, but did not appear to threaten the typical bog flora. Historically, beaver and other environmental influences have probably modified the vegetation development over millenia, including prolonged quiescent periods interrupted by periodic disturbances as documented in this study. For most peatlands this dynamic model appears more realistic than any orderly successional dogma.

AB The understanding of succession from rich fen to poorer fen types requires knowledge of changes in hydrology, water composition, peat chemistry and peat accumulation in the successional process. Water flow patterns, water levels and water chemistry, mineralisation rates and nutrient concentrations in above-ground vegetation were studied along a extreme-rich fen - moderate-rich fen gradient at Biebrza (Poland). The extreme-rich fen was a temporary groundwater discharge area, while in the moderate-rich fen groundwater flows laterally towards the river. The moderate-rich fen has a rainwater lens in spring and significant lower concentrations of calcium and higher concentrations of phosphate in the surface water. Mineralisation rates for N, P and K were higher in the moderate-rich fen. Phosphorus concentrations in plant material of the moderate-rich fen were higher than in the extreme-rich fen, but concentrations of N and K in plant material did not differ between both fen types. Water level dynamics and macro-remains of superficial peat deposits were similar in both fen types.
   We concluded that the differences observed in the moderate-rich and the extreme-rich fens were caused by subtile differences in the proportion of water sources at the peat surface (rainwater and calcareous groundwater, respectively). Development of an extreme-rich fen into a moderate-rich fen was ascribed to recent changes in river hydrology possibly associated with a change in management practices. The observed differences in P-availability between the fen types did not result in significantly different biomass. Moreover, biomass production in both fen types was primarily N-limited although P-availability was restricted too in the extreme-rich fen. Aulacomnium palustre, the dominant moss in the moderate-rich fen, might be favoured in competition because of its broad nutrient tolerance and its quick establishment after disturbance. It might outcompete low productive rich fen species which were shown to be N-limited in both fens. We present a conceptual model of successional pathways of rich fen vegetation in the Biebrza region.

AB Rich-fen vegetation influenced by hay-making in the Solendet Nature Reserve, Central Norway, was fertilized with N, P and K in a full-factorial fertilization experiment to investigate the nutrient limitation of plant growth at both community and species levels. Above-ground biomass, shoot density and nutrient concentration were measured in several species and groups of species at three sites after two years of fertilization. At the community level, the results indicate multiple limitation by N and P in the two least productive rich-fen communities: one characterized by small sedges and herbs, and the other by high abundance of Menyanthes trifoliata and tall sedges. Increased nutrient availability had no effect on a more highly productive, tall-growing, spring-influenced community, indicating no nutrient limitation. The results at the species level correspond well with those at the community level, indicating multiple limitation by N and P in most of the dominant and sub-dominant species. However, P seems to limit growth more than N in Succisa pratensis, and N seems to limit growth more than P in Carex panicea. Furthermore, Eriophorum angustifolium seems to be limited by K. The results did not show which nutrient limits the growth of Carex dioica, C. lasiocarpa and Trichophorum cespitosum. Indications that growth in low-productive, boreal rich-fen communities is generally limited by P was not confirmed.

AB Multiple analyses of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from pore waters were conducted to define the processes that govern carbon balance in peatlands: (1) source, reactivity, and transport of DOC with respect to vegetation, peat, and age of carbon substrate, (2) reactivity of DOC with respect to molecular size, and (3) lability to photoxidation of surficial DOC. We found that surface organic production fuels heterotrophic respiration at depth in advection-dominated peatlands, especially in fens. Fen DOC was C-14 enriched relative to the surrounding fen peat, and fen respiration products were similar to this enriched DOC indicating that DOC was the main microbial substrate. Bog DOC was more variable showing either enrichment in C-14 at depth or C-14 values that follow peat values. This variability in bogs is probably controlled by the relative importance of vertical transport of labile carbon substrates within the peat profile versus DOC production from bog peat. These results extended our set of observations to 10 years at one bog-fen pair and add two additional bog-fen pairs to our series of observations. Anaerobic incubations of peat, rinsed free of residual DOC, produced DOC and respiration products that were strikingly similar to the peat values in a bog and two fens. This result demonstrated conclusively that downward advection is the process responsible for the presence of modern DOC found at depth in the peat column. Fen DOC has lower C/N values and up to twice as much LMW (<1 kDa) DOC as bogs due to differences in organic inputs and greater microbial processing. Fluorescence irradiation experiments showed that fen DOC is more photolabile than bog DOC.

AB We investigated the importance of water chemistry and water regime for vascular plant and bryophyte species distribution in Western Carpathian mires dominated by Sphagnum. Seventy-seven small circle plots distributed across a wide geographical area, a wide range of mineral richness and all possible microtopographical features were sampled in terms of species composition, physical-chemical water properties and water regime during one growing season. Both water chemistry and water regime were found to be important factors for vegetation composition. Bryophytes reflected only one clear gradient, connected to base-richness (pH, conductivity) and maximal water-level, whereas three different environmental gradients determined the occurrence of vascular plants: water-level amplitude, base-richness and an indistinct gradient presumably connected to peat layer thickness. When the entire data set was subjected to DCA ordination, the first resulting axis was governed by the bryophyte subset, whereas the second one was governed by the vascular plant subset. The species density of vascular plants was positively correlated with pH and conductivity. On the contrary, bryophyte species density showed no relationship to environmental factors. We further compared the pH values measured in groundwater and in water squeezed from bryophytes from the same plot; these plots were distributed along the base-richness gradient. Only in the acidic mires did the use of squeezed-water chemistry in the analyses give results similar to the use of groundwater pH. Further, we found that Sphagnum species with a similar response to the base-richness gradient had differentiated niches with respect to the water level gradient and vice versa. Sphagnum contortum and S. warnstorfii exhibiting the same demands for groundwater pH were segregated along the gradient of maximum water level. An analogous pattern was detected for acidophilous species Sphagnum magellanicum and S. papillosum.

AB Peatlands are a critical carbon store comprising 30% of the Earth's terrestrial soil carbon. Sphagnum mosses comprise up to 90% of peat in the northern hemisphere but impacts of climate change on Sphagnum mosses are poorly understood, limiting development of sustainable peatland management and restoration. This study investigates the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) (800ppm) and hydrology on the growth of Sphagnum fallax, Sphagnum capillifolium and Sphagnum papillosum and greenhouse gas fluxes from moss-peat mesocosms. Elevated CO2 levels increased Sphagnum height and dry weight but the magnitude of the response differed among species. The most responsive species, S. fallax, yielded the most biomass compared to S. papillosum and S. capillifolium. Water levels and the CO2 treatment were found to interact, with the highest water level (1cm below the surface) seeing the largest increase in dry weight under eCO(2) compared to ambient (400ppm) concentrations. Initially, CO2 flux rates were similar between CO2 treatments. After week9 there was a consistent three-fold increase of the CO2 sink strength under eCO(2). At the end of the experiment, S. papillosum and S. fallax were greater sinks of CO2 than S. capillifolium and the -7cm water level treatment showed the strongest CO2 sink strength. The mesocosms were net sources of CH4 but the source strength varied with species, specifically S. fallax produced more CH4 than S. papillosum and S. capillifolium. Our findings demonstrate the importance of species selection on the outcomes of peatland restoration with regards to Sphagnum's growth and GHG exchange.

AB The reintroduction of Sphagnum fragments has been found to be a promising method for restoring mire vegetation in a cutaway peatland. Although it is known that moisture controls Sphagnum photosynthesis, information concerning the sensitivity of carbon dynamics on water-level variation is still scarce. In a 4-year field experiment, we studied the carbon dynamics of reintroduced Sphagnum angustifolium material in a restored (rewetted) cutaway peatland. Cutaway peatland restored by Sphagnum reintroduction showed high sensitivity to variation in water level. Water level controlled both photosynthesis and respiration. Gross photosynthesis (P-G) had a unimodal response to water-level variation with optimum level at -12 cm. The range of water level for high P-G (above 60% of the maximum light-saturated P-G) was between 22 and 1 cm below soil surface. Water level had a dual effect on total respiration. When the water level was below soil surface, peat respiration increased rapidly along the lowering water level until the respiration rate started to slow down at approximately -30 cm. Contrary to peat respiration, the response of Sphagnum respiration to water-level variation resembled that of photosynthesis with an optimum at -12 cm. In optimal conditions, Sphagnum reintroduction turned the cutaway site from carbon source to a sink of 23 g C/m(2) per season (mid-May to the end of September). In dry conditions, lowered photosynthesis together with the higher peat respiration led to a net loss of 56 g C/m(2). Although the water level above the optimum amplitude restricted CO2 fixation, a decrease in peat respiration led to a positive CO2 balance of 9 g C/m(2).

AB In this study, we investigated the links between peat carbon accumulation and past ecological and hydrological conditions in three peatlands (Bouleau, Mista, Auassat) which developed along a South-North transect within a watershed encompassing the boreal and subarctic domain in Eastern Canada. Peatland development and long-term apparent rates of carbon accumulation (LORCA) were asynchronous in the watershed, suggesting an influence of both latitude and topography (altitude) on the length of the growing season (GGD(0)). Results show that peat initiation within the three peatlands (respectively ca. 9070, 8400, and 6270 cal BP) was delayed after the deglaciation and that LORCA (respectively 35.5, 15.4, and 9.0 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) decreased from South to North. Peatland development and fen to bog transitions were found to be almost synchronous for the two southernmost sites. The fen to bog transition in the northernmost subarctic site was delayed until the 20th century, owing to the less favorable climatic conditions. This suggests that recent warming has extended the length of the growing season and increased Sphagnum growth enough to potentially influence an ecosystem state-shift as observed in other Subarctic regions of eastern Canada.

AB Ombrotrophic bogs depend on nutrient input from the atmosphere, so bird droppings may be a significant nutrient source. We studied the influx of N, P, and K by bird droppings, and the effects of this nutrient influx on the vegetation composition and development of Irish ombrotrophic bogs. Bird droppings significantly increased the influx of N, K, and particularly P. Concentrations of N, P, and K in the peat and vegetation were much higher at sites with bird droppings than at reference sites without bird droppings. Pinus sylvestris L. trees were able to grow much better at the sites with bird droppings, and growth was severely limited by P and K at the reference sites. Sites with bird droppings allowed atypical species to grow on ombrotrophic bogs. This change in vegetation composition alters the structure of the ombrotrophic vegetation locally, thereby affecting the atmospheric nutrient input and interception of precipitation.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays a key role in the peatland carbon balance and serves numerous ecological and chemical functions including acting as a microbial substrate. In this study, we quantify the concentration, biodegradability, and intrinsic properties of DOC obtained from peat, fresh material, and litter from nine species of ombrotrophic bog vegetation. Potential biodegradability was assessed by incubating vegetation extracts for 28 days in the dark and measuring percent DOC loss as the fraction of biodegradable DOC (%BDOC) while DOC properties were characterized using UV-Vis absorbance and fluorescence measurements. The mean initial DOC concentration extracted differed significantly among species (P < 0.05) and was significantly higher in fresh material, 217 +/- 259 mg DOC l(-1), than either litter or peat extracts with mean concentrations of 82.1 +/- 117 mg DOC l(-1) and 12.7 +/- 1.0 mg DOC l(-1), respectively (P < 0.05). %BDOC also differed significantly among species (P < 0.05) and ranged from 52 to 73% in fresh cuttings with the greatest fraction observed in S. magellanicum; 22-46% in litter; and 24% in peat. The majority of variability (82.5%) in BDOC was explained by initial absorbance at 254 nm and total dissolved nitrogen concentration which was further resolved into significant non-linear relationships between %BDOC and both humic-like and protein-like DOC fractions (P < 0.05). Our results highlight the extremely heterogeneous nature of the surface vegetation-derived DOC input in peatlands and stress the importance of vegetation species in peatland ecosystem function.

AB To clarify the effect of differences in hydrophyte life forms on methane (CH4) production and its carbon stable isotopic signature (C-13-CH4), we analyzed CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, their stable carbon isotope values, and chemical constituents dissolved in pore water in a small floating peat bog in Japan. Because eutrophication has modified the surrounding water quality, the bog vegetation on the mat has been, in part, replaced by fen-type vegetation. We hypothesized that differences in hydrophyte habitats affect redox conditions, including dissolved oxygen (DO) in water and therefore the amounts and carbon isotopic values of CH4 and CO2 dissolved in pore water. Between the habitats of two Sphagnum species, DO was considerably higher, and CH4 concentrations were significantly lower in Sphagnum cuspidatum Ehrh. habitats in hollow (DO: 0.620.20mg/L (standard error (SE)) and CH4: 0.180.02mmol/L) than in Sphagnum palustre L. habitats in hummock (DO: 0.290.08 and CH4: 0.820.06) in pore water (10cm depth). Both DO and CH4 concentrations in three vascular plant habitats (Rhynchospora fauriei Franch., Phragmites australis [reed], and Menyanthes trifoliata L.) in pore water (10cm depth) were intermediate relative to the two Sphagnum species. However, CH4 flux in M. trifoliata site was significantly higher than that at both Sphagnum sites, suggesting that the type of gas transport (diffusive or convective via root and stem) affected the depth profile of CH4 concentrations and its flux. C-13-CH4 values in pore water also varied among the vegetation types, even within Sphagnum species (e.g., at 10cm depth, C-13-CH4: R. fauriei, -55.3 +/- 1.8 parts per thousand (SE); P. australis, -57.5 +/- 1.6 parts per thousand; M. trifoliata, -56.7 +/- 1.5 parts per thousand; S. cuspidatum, -71.2 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand; and S. palustre, -60.4 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand). Our results suggest that significant differences arise in CH4 concentration and C-13-CH4 values among the hydrophyte habitats even within a small peat bog and that change in vegetation relative to trophic conditions can affect CH4 emissions and associated C-13-CH4 values.

AB We present a method for analysing subfossil plant cuticles preserved in peat and apply the method to provide a preliminary, coarse resolution reconstruction of Holocene vegetation history at Moanatuatua Bog, northern North Island, New Zealand. The plant cuticle record reveals the early-Holocene development of a swamp and its transition to a raised bog, which is not apparent from other proxies. Comparison with a pollen record from the same sequence highlights the advantages of plant cuticle analysis in cases where pollen is hard to identify or poorly preserved. In particular, distinguishing between the pollen grains of the two main bog species, the restiads Empodisma robustum and Sporadanthus ferrugineus, relies on subtle gradational characteristics, whereas their cuticular patterns are very distinct. Furthermore, Cyperaceae pollen is poorly preserved at Moanatuatua Bog, being almost completely absent, whereas the Cyperaceae cuticles are present throughout the sequence. Therefore, we suggest that Cyperaceae pollen at this site is a less reliable indicator of local sedge communities than the cuticle record. The wide dispersal capabilities of these wind-dispersed pollen types also make them less suitable for determining local site vegetation and environmental change in comparison with cuticle remains. These results suggest that plant cuticle analysis may be a useful tool for the reconstruction of long-term vegetation changes from peat sequences, especially when used in concert with palynology. Sample preparation also proved to be fast with little equipment or chemicals needed.

AB Peat bogs preserve past biodiversity in a way which is unique among ecosystems, but the full realization of this, and the exploitation of the various records which are archived in the stratified layers of peat, is only now beginning. Present knowledge of peat formation in ombrotrophic or rain-fed bogs is reviewed and the many advantages of such systems as proxy-data sources are summarized. Some results of recent work involving pollen analysis and human impact, pollution histories, volcanic ash layers, plant macrofossils and the prospects for a detailed proxy-climate record are presented. The present vegetation of such bogs is only a very partial view of their past biodiversity; the conservation of the peat that remains must have a high priority.

AB [1] Methane fluxes were measured at five sites representing oligotrophic peatlands along a European transect. Five study plots were subjected to elevated CO2 concentration (560 ppm), and five plots to NH4NO3 (3 or 5 g N yr(-1)). The CH4 emissions from the control plots correlated in most cases with the soil temperatures. The depth of the water table, the pH, and the DOC, N and SO4 concentrations were only weakly correlated with the CH4 emissions. The elevated CO2 treatment gave nonsignificantly higher CH4 emissions at three sites and lower at two sites. The N treatment resulted in higher methane emissions at three sites (nonsignificant). At one site, the CH4 fluxes of the N-treatment plots were significantly lower than those of the control plots. These results were not in agreement with our hypotheses, nor with the results obtained in some earlier studies. However, the results are consistent with the results of the vegetation analyses, which showed no significant treatment effects on species relationships or biomass production.

AB In this long-term study, we identify the climate variables most important to flowering density in Eriophorum latifolium in boreal rich fen vegetation, and assess their relative importance. We analysed time-series data (1982-2008) of flowering density in 126 permanent plots in an oceanic and a continental area in Norway, and developed an autoregressive model where the density of flowering plants was determined by the cost of previous flowering, climate during the same year as flowering, and climate during the year prior to flowering. The cost of reproduction was the most influential of the factors affecting flowering. Our results suggest that dry conditions during the previous summer affected flowering negatively in the oceanic population, but had no effect in the continental population. We attribute this to differences in hydrology, with steeply sloping fens in the oceanic area, and gently sloping, spring-fed fens in the continental area. Furthermore, flowering increased with the length of the previous growing season (oceanic population), decreased with the amount of precipitation during the previous spring (continental population), and increased with temperature in spring the same year (both populations). We conclude that climate conditions during the previous year are more important than climate conditions during the year of flowering.

AB The large accumulation of organic matter in peat-lands is primarily caused by slow rates of litter decomposition. We determined rates of decomposition of major peat-forming litters of vascular plants and mosses at five sites: a poor fen in New Hampshire and a bog hummock, a poor fen, a beaver pond margin and a beaver pond in Ontario. We used the litterbag technique, retrieving triplicate litterbags six or seven times over 3-5 years, and found that simple exponential decay and continuous-quality non-linear regression models could adequately characterize the decomposition in most cases. Within each site, the rate of decomposition at the surface was generally Typha latifolia leaves = Chamaedaphne calyculata leaves = Carex leaves > Chamaedaphne calyculata stems > hummock Sphagnum = lawn/hollow Sphagnum, with exponential decay constant (k) values generally ranging from 0.05 to 0.37 and continuous-quality model initial quality (qo) values ranging from 1.0 (arbitrarily set for Typha leaves) to 0.7 (Sphagnum). In general, surface decay rates were slowest at the bog hummock site, which had the lowest water table, and in the beaver pond, which was inundated, and fastest at the fens. The continuous-quality model site decomposition parameter (up) ranged from 0.80 to 0.17. Analysis of original litter samples for carbon, nitrogen and proximate fractions revealed a relatively poor explanation of decomposition rates, as defined by k and q(0), compared to most well-drained ecosystems. Three litters, roots of sedge and a shrub and Typha leaves, were placed at depths of 10, 30 and 60 em at the sites. Decomposition rates decreased with depth at each site, with k means of 0.15, 0.08 and 0.05 y(-1) at 10, 30 and 60 cm, respectively, and up of 0.25, 0.13 and 0.07. These differences are primarily related to the position of the water table at each site and to a lesser extent the cooler temperatures in the lower layers of the peat. The distinction between bog and fen was less important than the position of the water table. These results show that we can characterize decomposition rates of surface litter in northern peatlands, but given the large primary productivity below-ground in these ecosystems, and the differential rates of decomposition with depth, subsurface input and decomposition of organic matter is an important and relatively uncertain attribute.

AB Data from 55 published studies of Sphagnum productivity were compiled covering 31 peat-moss species from Sphagnum-dominated wetlands. The relationships between productivity and geographical position and climatic parameters were investigated based on data from both the northern and southern hemispheres. There were interspecific differences in productivity, which could be explained by both phylogeny and microhabitat preferences. Species of section Cuspidata had greater productivity than species of section Acutifolia. The wetter microhabitat carpets and lawns had higher productivity than the drier hummocks. Climatic conditions (mean annual temperature and precipitation), together with geographical factors, were able to explain 40 of the variation in productivity. The most important single factor explaining productivity on a global scale in Sphagnum-dominated wetlands was the mean annual temperature. Climatic parameters, together with geographical position, are important for estimating the global patterns of Sphagnum productivity, and can be used to estimate productivity changes in Sphagnum-dominated wetlands under climatic warming scenarios.

AB The present study reports on the development of ombrotrophic raised bogs in NE Germany after the adoption of a protective program with a focus on the hydrological and floristic changes in two simultaneously restored cut-over bogs as a reference for all other bogs. At the moment, four fifths of the bogs area is dominated by woody vegetation forms and < 5 % is characterized by typical raised bog vegetation. The trend of increasing areas with woody vegetation forms and decreasing areas with vegetation typical for ombrotrophic raised bogs could not be prevented despite increasing the portion of revitalized areas. The reason for the negative developments is founded in the different types of raised bogs in NE Germany, which differ in regard to the historical lagg area and the original grown up raised peat body. This as well as the kind and intensity of anthropogenic use have significant implications for the possibilities of revitalization and protection. Except for those bogs where no peat remnants remain, the revitalization of cut-over raised bogs in NE Germany can succeed if an almost closed hydrological protection zone (HPZ which is equal to the historical lagg area) is established so that the gradient of entire lateral water flow between the higher lying peat remnant and the lower lying surrounding area is reduced. The attainment of a lateral water flow gradient comparable to the original state and of a water-saturated peat body succeeds in turn in the precondition for growing Sphagnum species, which readjust the system's self regulation. The comparison of two bogs with similar preconditions concerning location, climate, and anthropogenic transformation has shown that an incompletely closed HPZ is one important reason for the decreasing portion of intact raised bogs with their typical vegetation. The influence of climate change on current hydrological and floristic changes in NE German ombrotrophic raised bogs has less influence on the success of revitalization than the historic grown type of bog and the intensity of anthropogenic use.

DT Article
DE MIRE TYPOLOGY, PHYTOSOCIOLOGY, VEGETATION SCIENCE; HYDROCHEMISTRY;
   MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES
AB The rough morphology of the relief does not allow true raised peat bogs to develop in the Alps. Alpine peatlands are located on more or less inclined terrain and show series of transitional types from ombrosoligenous mires to fens, thus complicating the task of typifying mires and mire complexes. In this study five peatlands situated in the upper montane - lower subalpine vegetation belt of the South Tyrolian Alps (Italy) were considered as a representative sample of that range. Vegetation was studied by field releves and mapped. Watertable depth as well as hydrochemistry (pH, electrical conductivity, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) were monitored along transects at all sites.
   By means of average linkage clustering (with Jaccard-index as similarity-coefficient) and comparison with material published up to now 9 different vegetation types belonging to 4 alliances (Piceion abietis / Bazzanio-Piceetum; Sphagnion magellanici / Pine mugo-Sphagnetum, Sphagnetum magellanici with 2 subassociations; Rhynchosporion albae / Caricetum rostratae, Caricetum limosae with 2 subassociations; Caricion davallianae / Schoenetum ferruginei, Caricetum davallianae) were distinguished. The peatlands analysed revealed as complexes of hydrologically different segments. In no case, however, could a clear delimintation be defined between ombrotrophic and minerotrophic areas since the peat surface is never distinctly raised above the surrounding terrain.
   Two main groups of peatlands could be distinguished. First, fen complexes heavily influenced by ground water and covered by a brown-moss sedge vegetation. These peatlands also include more or less extensive carpets of Sphagna that can be either distinctly minerotrophic or nearly ombrotrophic. Second, bog complexes mostly covered by a hummock-hollow mosaic having, if any, only a very loose contact with telluric water. A peripheric lagg is poorly differentiated at all of these latter sites. However, a narrow belt of wet fen often develops at the downslope edge. It can either directly rest on the mineral substrate or on humified acidic peat.
   Plant communities defined by the BRAUN-BLANQUET approach are predictive with respect to mire habitat, especially when operating at a low hierarchical rank (subassociations). Even though most of those communities are by no means restricted to a given mire type, the whole vegetational pattern is well correlated with gross hydromorphological features.

AB Acidification and eutrophication have caused great changes in fen ecosystems in The Netherlands. The main problems are the surplus of acid rainwater, forming a lens above the calcareous groundwater, and the blanket effect of the Sphagnum cover which results in a loss of rare species and species-rich plant communities. Research on effects of restoration measures was carried out in a floating fen with a vegetation type at present dominated by Sphagnum squarrosum, S. fallax and Polytrichum commune. The nutrient dynamics were compared in 64 experimental plots which received foul different treatments: control, drainage, sod removal and combined drainage plus sod removal. The amounts of extractable and mineralisable N and P were significantly reduced after both sod removal treatments. There was a significant negative correlation (p < 0.001) between pH and nutrient availability. After two years the mosses had again become dominant (> 90% cover) in the plots that had only the sod removal. they remained dominant in the control and drainage treatments. In the drainage plus son removal plots, however, these bryophytes were still absent and the coverage of many characteristic fen species had increased considerably. These conditions have persisted for a further three years (to 1995). Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Limited

AB The investigations were carried out in six small mid-forest peat bogs with active peat-forming processes, all situated in the Lublin region (Eastern Poland). The bogs represented two floristically different types of peatland: raised bogs and transitional mires species composition analysis and specific chemistry analysis (pH, Eh, carbon content, N, P, Mg, Na, Ca, Mn, Fe, dehydrogenase activity and water level) were performed. The plant assotiations/communities of the peat bogs represented three phytosociological classes: Scheuchzerio-Caricetea nigrae, Oxycocco-Sphagnetea, and Vaccinio-Piceetea. The analysis of redox potential measured in the different communities revealed differences in the Eh values between these phytocoenoses (p < 0.001). Assotiations representing Vaccinio uliginosi-Pinetwn were found in areas characterised by the highest redox potential. Redox potential values in these communities were significantly higher than the values recorded in bog communities and mosaic associations. Seasonal variability of the redox potential was noted as well. The current research indicates that soil chemical parameters: pH, Eh are closely related with water table level and plant distributions.

AB Question: Large databases contain many plots, but few subsets with measured environmental data. To obtain broader datasets, researchers use expert-based indicator values as surrogates; alternatively, these can be estimated by imputation. Does imputation provide more exact approximations than indicator values?
   Location: West Carpathians (Slovakia, Poland, Czech Republic) and Bulgaria.
   Methods: We developed a simple imputation method based on plot similarity that estimates missing environmental variables for plots - MOSS (mean of similar samples). This was tested for pH and conductivity, important environmental factors influencing vegetation composition and structure within wetlands, on two datasets of 485 (West Carpathians) and 118 (Bulgaria) plots for which directly measured values were available. The West Carpathian dataset was used for calibration. Imputation was based on calculating mean of the measured factor from a group of most similar plots. Using pre-defined similarity criteria, we selected subsets of both datasets and compared estimated and measured values. Using root mean-squared error of prediction, we compared predictive power of MOSS with Ellenberg indicator values and other recent methods.
   Results: Within one study region, MOSS predicts sample pH and conductivity more precisely than Ellenberg and similar calibration methods. Predictive power slightly decreased when MOSS was transferred to a distant region.
   Conclusions: Imputation using MOSS appears to accurately predict pH and conductivity from existing composition data within a single geographical region, and thus increases number of replicates. MOSS does not require expert-based indicator values, which may be imprecise. We provide examples where MOSS can be utilised without risk of circular reasoning or introducing pseudo-replications.

AB Within an ombrogenous part of N. Kisselbergmosen, Rodenes, SE Norway, fine-scale changes in species abundance, successional trends relative to the main gradients (as represented by DCA axes), and co-ordinated change within pairs of the bottom layer species are studied. Data sets were sampled twice with a five-year interval, and included species abundance and cover of mud bottom, naked peat and litter in 436 sample plots (16 cm x 16 cm), and species abundance in 6976 subplots (4 cm x 4 cm). Depth from the surface of subplots to the water table was estimated in 1991. Most summers and growing seasons were somewhat drier than normal in the 5-yr period. The area covered by mud-bottom, naked peat and litter increased significantly, as did the frequencies of the dwarf shrubs Calluna vulgaris and Andromeda polifolia in hummocks and upper lawn. Sample plots were significantly displaced downward the peat productivity gradient (DCA 2), reflecting the reduced cover of many bottom layer species, including all Sphagnum spp. Significant coordinated changes in cover of bottom layer species are described. The changes observed in hummocks support the existence of a local regeneration cycle, as suggested by other researchers. Some of the vegetation changes seem parallel to those reported from areas with a higher nitrogen deposition, but it is not likely that nitrogen deposition alone is the major cause of the observed changes. Between-year variation in population size and climatic fluctuations may as well explain the observed changes.

AB 1. Long-term studies are necessary to describe effects of restoration efforts on plant communities and invasive species in North American fen communities. In 1986, 1999 and 2000, wetland plant communities and abiotic factors were sampled in two fens in Ohio that were actively managed as a state nature preserve since 1986. The correlation between plant species and environmental conditions was examined in 1986 to 2000, and changes in woody plant cover were measured on aerial photographs from 1938 to 1997 to analyse long-term effects of management practices.
   2. 142 vascular plant species and 32 bryophyte taxa were found in these rich fens, including 13 rare (i.e. state-listed as endangered, threatened or potentially threatened) and 14 alien species. TWINSPAN analyses identified nine plant community types, and species distributions were correlated with several abiotic factors (groundwater depth, pH, soil organic content, distance from wetland edge and depth of peat). Communities along the wetland edge in deep peat had higher richness, more woody species, more alien species and fewer rare species than communities in areas near sources of flowing groundwater with more marl and less peat.
   3. There was little change in species richness, evenness, and Shannon's diversity from 1986 to 2000. However, plant species assemblages changed during the study, and changes were different in unmanipulated transects compared with those where habitat managers removed invasive woody plants. An aerial photograph analysis indicated that woody plant cover increased by about 1% each year during 1938 to 1997 despite current management efforts to remove invasive trees and shrubs. Additional strategies should be directed toward reducing shrub encroachment and invasive species while promoting rare species. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Pristine bogs, peatlands in which vegetation is exclusively fed by rainwater (ombrotrophic), typically have a low atmospheric deposition of reactive nitrogen (N) (< 0.5 kg ha(-1) y(-1)). An important additional N source is N-2 fixation by symbiotic microorganisms (diazotrophs) in peat and mosses. Although the effects of increased total airborne N by anthropogenic emissions on bog vegetation are well documented, the important question remains how different N forms (ammonium, NH4+, versus nitrate, NO3-) affect N cycling, as their relative contribution to the total load strongly varies among regions globally.
   Here, we studied the effects of 11 years of experimentally increased deposition (32 versus 8 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) of either NH4+ or NO3- on N accumulation in three moss and one lichen species (Sphagnum capillifolium, S. papillosum, Pleurozium schreberi and Cladonia portentosa), N-2 fixation rates of their symbionts, and potential N losses to peat soil and atmosphere, in a bog in Scotland.
   Increased input of both N forms led to 15-90% increase in N content for all moss species, without affecting their cover. The keystone species S. capillifolium showed 4 times higher N allocation into free amino acids, indicating N stress, but only in response to increased NH4+. In contrast, NO3- addition resulted in enhanced peat N mineralization linked to microbial NO(3)(-)reduction, increasing soil pH, N concentrations and N losses via denitrification. Unexpectedly, increased deposition from 8 to 32 kg ha(-1) y(-1) in both N forms did not affect N-2 fixation rates for any of the moss species and corresponded to an additional input of 5 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) with a 100% S. capillifolium cover. Since both N forms clearly show differential effects on living Sphagnum and biogeochemical processes in the underlying peat, N form should be included in the assessment of the effects of N pollution on peatlands.

AB Peatland buffer areas are important means in reducing sediment and nutrient loading from discharge waters in a variety of landscapes; however, use of natural mires as buffer areas may induce unwanted changes in the plant species composition. Vegetation composition dynamics were studied at one rewetted peatland and two natural peatlands used as buffer areas in forested catchments in southern and central Finland. In addition to the sediment and nutrient loads from the upstream catchments, the buffer areas received nitrogen and phosphorus from two artificial additions made in 2003-2005 and 2008 in order to simulate loads caused by forestry operations. The first vegetation inventory was done in the year of buffer construction (1996 or 2000), the second inventory 4-5 years after the first one, and the third inventory after 9-13 years. The vegetation composition changed significantly at all three buffer areas. Grasses and sedges, as well as herbs were generally favored by the use of peatlands as buffer areas, and at the species level, the coverages of Menyanthes trifoliata and Calamagrostis purpurea increased the most. At the two natural sites, the change in vegetation composition was more apparent in the upstream parts of the buffer areas, probably because they received more sediments and nutrients than the lower parts. Also, the vegetation changed significantly more in the lawn-level surfaces than in the hummocks. As the vegetation composition in natural peatlands used as buffer areas is likely to undergo significant changes, the use of endangered mire site types should be avoided.

AB Multiple measures of plant diversity are vital to understand the response of plant communities to changing environmental conditions in peatlands. We assessed whether functional, phylogenetic and taxonomic diversities of woody and herbaceous fen peatlands in East Anglia, UK varied between plant communities under different management practices (mowing and grazing). We adjusted the weight of phylogenetic distances in a combined functional-phylogenetic distance matrix to assess functional and phylogenetic diversities separately and in combination. We tested the phylogenetic signal of four traits (leaf dry-matter content, leaf N, leaf delta C-13 and leaf delta N-15) and employed null models to determine patterns of clustering and over-dispersion of traits and phylogenies. We used rarefaction to determine if observed taxonomic diversity was higher or lower than expected. Functional, phylogenetic and taxonomic diversities varied across and within vegetation types. Annual grazing was associated with reduced functional and phylogenetic diversities but was not significantly associated with taxonomic diversity. Annual mowing was associated with increased phylogenetic and taxonomic diversities. Multiple diversity metrics can provide complementary or contrasting information. While there are benefits to annual management of wetlands (benefitting rare species), these must be weighed against eroding functional and phylogenetic diversities that can potentially adversely affect responses to environmental change. Communities mown every seven to eight years supported characteristic fen vegetation and maintained high plant diversity across a range of measures. Our results sound a cautionary note of neglecting to monitor multiple plant diversity measures in managed habitats, since attempts to maximize one may inadvertently lead to the erosion of others.

AB Spatial patterns of the oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) of soil, water level and chemistry were examined in the fen area of the Tohfutsu mire, northern Japan, where horse pasturage has been carried out throughout the growing season every year. The fen vegetation consisted mosaically of communities mono- or codominated by Eleocharis kamtschatica, Iris setosa and Carex lyngbyei. The highest concentration of total dissolved nitrogen of soil water was observed in the dwarf community dominated by E. kamtschatica with smaller biomass, whereas the nutrient level was lower in the community monodominated by C. lyngbyei with larger biomass. Principal component analysis denoted well that Eh, N, K, and pH contributed to the differentiation of these communities significantly. During the growing season that was investigated, the highest nitrogen concentration was observed in midsummer, when plants are expected to absorb nutrients intensely, indicating that the supply of dissolved nitrogen far exceeded the nutrient uptake of plants. Multiple habitats with reduced soil were formed by submergence and by an excess of nitrogen due to pasturage, and the soil reduction indirectly inhibited the incursion of species with large biomass at such sites. It was demonstrated that soil Eh contributed to the anomalous pattern of vegetation where the supply of available nitrogen exceeds the uptake by plants.

AB Peat cores from five Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in boreal continental Canada were analyzed for plant macrofossils. Results indicate that peatland development was influenced both by local autogenic and regional climatic factors. The general direction in peatland development from rich fen to poor fen to bog can primarily be ascribed to internal processes, especially peat accumulation. Quantitative paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on fossil moss assemblages indicate that all five peatlands were initially dominated by brown mosses with inferred pHs of approximately 6.0, and a water table at 5 - 15 cm below the surface of the peatland. Subsequently, Sphagnum-dominated peatlands developed with pHs of 4.0-4.5 and a water table at 15-30 cm of depth. Chemical factors triggered a rapid transition from rich fen (pH > 6) to poor fen and bog (pH < 5). The two most southerly peatlands are youngest, with basal dates of 4670 BP and 4230 BP. Sphagnum peat accumulation at these sites started at 2620 BP and 1790 BP, respectively. Two sites located at intermediate latitudes have basal dates of > 5140 BP and 5020 BP, while the development of Sphagnum-dominated ecosystems dates back to almost-equal-to 3100 BP and 3710 BP, respectively. The most northerly site has the oldest basal date (> 7870 BP), and the oldest date for the initiation of Sphagnum peat accumulation (almost-equal-to 7000 BP). The younger age of the peat deposits in the four southern sites is due to warm and dry climatic conditions during the middle Holocene that prevented peatland development until after 6000 BP when the climate gradually became cooler and moister. Farther north the climate was cool and moist enough to allow peatland development during the early to middle Holocene. In three southern peatlands, the development into a Sphagnum-dominated ecosystem took > 2000 years, while at the more northerly sites Sphagnum became dominant after < 1500 years.

AB Mires (bogs and fens) are nutrient-limited peatland ecosystems, the vegetation of which is especially sensitive to nitrogen deposition and climate change. The role of mires in the global carbon cycle, and the delivery of different ecosystem services can be considerably altered by changes in the vegetation, which has a strong impact on peat-formation and hydrology. Mire ecosystems are commonly open with limited canopy cover but both nitrogen deposition and increased temperatures may increase the woody vegetation component. It has been predicted that such an increase in tree cover and the associated effects on light and water regimes would cause a positive feed-back loop with respect to the ground vegetation. None of these effects, however, have so far been confirmed in large-scale spatiotemporal studies. Here we analyzed data pertaining to mire vegetation from the Swedish National Forest Inventory collected from permanent sample plots over a period of 20 yr along a latitudinal gradient covering 14 degrees. We hypothesized that the changes would be larger in the southern parts as a result of higher nitrogen deposition and warmer climate. Our results showed an increase in woody vegetation with increases in most ericaceous dwarf-shrubs and in the basal area of trees. These changes were, in contrast to our expectations, evenly distributed over most of the latitudinal gradient. While nitrogen deposition is elevated in the south, the increase in temperatures during recent decades has been larger in the north. Hence, we suggest that different processes in the north and south have produced similar vegetation changes along the latitudinal gradient. There was, however, a sharp increase in compositional change at high deposition, indicating a threshold effect in the response. Instead of a positive feed-back loop caused by the tree layer, an increase in canopy cover reduced the changes in composition of the ground vegetation, whereas a decrease in canopy cover lead to larger changes. Increased natural disturbances of the tree layer due to, for example, pathogens or climate is a predicted outcome of climate change. Hence, these results may have important implications for predictions of long-term effects of increased temperature on peatland vegetation.

AB 1 A literature comparison of 14 radiocarbon-dated macrofossil records of raised peat bog initiation indicates that there is a relationship between the prevailing climate and the character of the first ombrotrophic vegetation communities at peatland sites in Britain and Ireland.
   2 All that is required for ombrotrophy is the separation of the mire growing surface from the influence of surface and subsurface waters. This could occur via vertical accumulation of the peat mass or a lowering of the water table. The establishment of bog species can be rapid once isolation occurs.
   3 Peatlands may become ombrotrophic in a variety of water table conditions and climatic regimes. There are at least two distinctive routes to ombrotrophy, via a 'dry-pioneer oligotrophic community' or via a 'wet-pioneer oligotrophic community'.
   4 Tregaron South-east Bog does not fit the pattern suggested by the literature comparison. The Fen-Bog Transition (FBT) occurred in a period of increased effective precipitation but the first ombrotrophic community was indicative of relatively dry, 'hummocky' bog and a deep or unstable water table.
   5 The transitional poor fen communities at Tregaron South-east Bog were short-lived. Sphagnum palustre mire lasted for 90 years compared to 300 years at Bolton Fell Moss in Cumbria, and the FBT was synchronous across much of the bog.
   6 The Tregaron peatland complex has a long history of water table fluctuations as shown by the stratigraphy of the marginal peats.
   7 Channel incision in the River Teifi could have contributed to the development of 'dry hummock' pioneer bog in the humid climatic conditions at 7300 cal. BP, by reducing the level of lagg streams.

AB A Holocene history of vegetation, climate, and ombrogenous mire development is presented from pollen and plant macrofossil analyses of sediments at Kopouatai Bog, a large, raised, restiad bog in northern New Zealand. Tephra layers of established ages, supplemented by numerous radiocarbon dates, provide a secure chronology. The earliest peats, overlying last glacial sediments, and dated at c. 11700 radiocarbon years BP, with extensive accumulation after c. 10360 BP, are dominated by pollen of warm temperate podocarp-angiosperm forest, indicating a moist, mild early-Holocene climate. The bog began as a series of small soligenous mires within lowland podocarp-dominated swamp forest but was mostly oligotrophic by c. 8500 BP. Feat accumulation rates have varied spatially and temporally, averaging 0.9 mm yr(-1) in central and southern areas. The deposition of deltaic muds in the northern part of the bog accompanied a marine transgression c. 6500-5000 BP, while elsewhere an associated groundwater table rise resulted in a temporary return to mesotrophic conditions. As the marine influence subsequently receded, the northern areas remained subject to regular flooding, but underwent rapid peat growth at a mean rate of 1.7 mm yr(-1), while oligotrophic conditions returned to other parts of the bog. Regional vegetation developments indicate a change, c. 6000 BP, to drier, frostier conditions during the late Holocene. Ascarina lucida and Agathis australis may be used as regional pollen-stratigraphic markers for the early Holocene and late Holocene, respectively. The loss of tall trees and expansion of subcanopy species and seral vegetation in forests near Kopouatai Bog, just before the deposition of Kaharoa Tephra (c. 700 BP), are likely evidence for human activity dating from at least this time.

AB Half of the Finnish peatland area is drained for forestry. The remaining undrained peatlands are not all pristine, because surrounding drainage may disturb their hydrology. This concerns especially aapa mires, which are dependent on hydrological connections to their upper catchments. We investigated the amount and sizes of Finnish undrained peatlands, the drainage state of their margins, and the naturalness of aapa mires in large (> 50 ha) undrained peatland areas, using a GIS analysis based on digital map data, aerial images and an elevation model. The results show that a majority (66.7 % of count, 84.7 % of area) of undrained peatland areas have at least partly drained margins. Drainage activities commonly disturb minerotrophic water discharge to aapa mires. In the middle boreal zone, on average 41.6 % (median 42.8 %) of the catchment area of aapa mires is such that hydrological connection with the mire is disturbed by intervening drainage. In the southern boreal zone, the figure is 25.1 % (median 16.1 %), and in the southern part of the northern boreal zone 24.2 % (median 9.9 %). Possible implications of the disturbances include tree encroachment, hummock formation and fen-bog transition, which is likely to cause a loss of biodiversity but could potentially increase peat growth and carbon sequestration.

AB Questions What is the distribution of base-rich fen vegetation and the specialist species along European biogeographic regions? How do the gradients in species composition correlate to geography and climate at continental scale? What are the implications of such patterns for the classification of these habitats? Location Fifteen countries of Central, Western and Northern Europe. Methods We compiled a vegetation plot database of base-rich fens and related communities including vascular plants and bryophytes. The initial data set with 6943 plots was filtered according to the presence of specialists using discriminant analysis. We used DCA to analyse the correlation of species composition with geography and climate, and kriging interpolation for mapping gradients in the study area. Modified TWINSPAN was used to detect major vegetation groups. The results of the whole data set (plot size 1-100m(2)) were compared with those obtained from two subsets with plots of 1-5m(2) and 6-30m(2). Results Most of the specialists were distributed among all the biogeographic regions, but many were more represented in the Alpine than in the Atlantic, Boreal and Continental regions. Variation in species composition was mainly correlated to temperature, precipitation and latitude in the three data sets, showing a major gradient from (1) alpine belt fens characterized by spring species to (2) small sedge fens mainly distributed in mountain regions and (3) boreo-temperate fens reflecting waterlogged conditions. Conclusions Base-rich fen communities are widely distributed across European biogeographic regions, but the Alpine region can be considered as the compositional centre of this vegetation type. Large-scale gradients of species composition are mainly explained by climate, while the influence of latitude is probably correlated to increasing water table in the boreo-temperate regions. These gradients can be better understood by differentiating three major vegetation types, which should be considered when establishing classification systems of base-rich fens in Europe.

AB During the past few years, surveys of AOX (adsorbable organic halogens) in water and TOX (total amount of organic halogens) in soil have demonstrated that natural halogenation of organic macromolecules is responsible for the widespread occurrence of organohalogens in seemingly unpolluted environments. This study revealed the presence of several chlorinated aromatic structures in organic matter derived from different types of decaying plant material and soil. In samples derived from fresh plant matter, however, there was normally no evidence of such structures. Two types of samples were analyzed: (i) lignin materials isolated by acidic solvolysis of fresh and decaying spruce wood, birch leaves, peat moss (Sphagnum), and meadow grass and (ii) high molecular weight organic matter leached with base from spruce forest soil and meadow grass soil. An oxidative degradation technique was used to render the studied structures amenable to gas chromatography with atomic emission detection (GC-AED) and mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS). The identified degradation products were methyl esters of 3-chloro- and 3,5-dichloro-4-ethoxybenzoic acid, 5-chloro-4-ethoxy-3-methoxybenzoic acid, dichloro-and trichlorobenzoic acids, and 3,5-dichloro-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

AB In the Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), mires directly affected by peat extraction cover almost 90,000 ha. Of these, over 26,200 ha have already been extracted and are abandoned. The main aim of this article is to give an overview of the extent of extracted peatlands in the Baltics, the legislative background around the land-use options, and the directions of after-use of peatlands since the middle of the 20th century. We also critically review results from restoration of abandoned extracted peatlands and assess whether they are on a trajectory toward reinitiation of paludification and functioning mire ecosystems. Almost all currently existing abandoned extracted peatlands in the Baltics were abandoned during and shortly after the Soviet period (1940-1991) without any restoration measures. The rest of the extracted areas were mostly afforested, converted into agricultural lands, berry plantations, or water bodies. The after-use was mostly experimental, lacking systematic, proper assessment of outcome, cost and benefits, and side effects. The data are scarce but it could be estimated that only < 10% (Estonia and Lithuania) and < 20% (Latvia) of the total area of abandoned extracted peatlands were used for some purposes after peat extraction. Recently, several trials aimed at restoring the mire vegetation and ecosystem functions have been started in abandoned extracted peatlands in all three countries. In the coming years, the restoration of extracted peatlands in the Baltics will start on much bigger areas within different projects and initiatives cofinanced by the European Union.

AB Impacts of long-term drying and associated vegetation change on anaerobic decomposition, methane production, and pore water composition in peat bogs are poorly documented. To identify some of these impacts, we analyzed peat humification, pore water solutes, in situ and in vitro respiration rates, and Gibbs free energies of methanogenesis in a bog near a drainage ditch established in 1923. We compared drained peat under open bog vegetation and forest with a bog reference site. Drainage and tree growth induced an enrichment in carboxylic, aromatic, and phenolic moieties in the peat. Short-term in vitro respiration rates significantly decreased with humification (R (2) > 0.6, p < 0.01). Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CH4 concentrations also attained lower maxima in drained areas. However, near the water table in situ respiration intensified as indicated by steeper increases in DIC and CH4 concentrations than at the reference site, especially under forest. Maximum in situ CO2 production derived from inverse pore water modeling was 10.3 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) (forest) and 6.3 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) (bog) and was one to two orders of magnitude slower than in vitro anaerobic respiration. In the highly decomposed shallow peats under forest, methane production was suppressed and DOC concentration elevated. Raised H-2 concentrations (up to 200 nmol l(-1)) and in situ Gibbs free energies of down to -60 kJ mol(-1) (CH4) suggested an inhibition of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis by an unidentified factor at these sites. The study documents that several changes in biogeochemical process patterns do occur post-drainage, especially when tree growth is triggered. Most importantly, the establishment of forest on intensely humified peats can lower in situ methane production.

We evaluated the Holocene Peatland Model (HPM) simulation against the field observations from a chronosequence of peatlands and peat core data. The ongoing primary peatland formation on the isostatically rising coast of Finland offered us an exceptional opportunity to study the peatland succession along a spatial continuum and to compare it with the past succession revealed by vertical peat sequences. The current vegetation assemblages, from the seashore to a 3000 year old bog, formed a continuum from minerotrophic to ombrotrophic plant communities. A similar sequence of plant communities was found in the palaeovegetation. The distribution of plant functional types was related to peat thickness and water-table depth (WTD) supporting the assumptions in HPM, though there were some differences between the field data and HPM. Palaeobotanical evidence from the oldest site showed a rapid fen-bog transition, indicated by a coincidental decrease in minerotrophic plant functional types and an increase in ombrotrophic plant functional types. The long-term mean rate of carbon (C) accumulation varied from 2 to 34 g C/m(2) per yr, being highest in the intermediate age cohorts. Mean nitrogen (N) accumulation varied from 0.1 to 3.9 g N/m(2) per yr being highest in the youngest sites. WTD was the deepest in the oldest sites and its variation there was temporally the least but spatially the highest. Evaluation of the HPM simulations against the field observations indicated that HPM reasonably well simulates peatland development, except for very young peatlands.

AB In recent years an increasing number of streams have been restored to improve conditions for natural fen and meadow vegetation to develop in the associated riparian areas, but with modest success. Here we apply a controlled and replicated approach to investigate the role of flooding, sediment deposition, and seed addition for species recruitment in riparian areas with different types of standing vegetation. We expect that species recruitment is restricted in areas where the vegetation is dominated by fast-growing productive species because competition for light will make the establishment of new species difficult, especially for low-productive target species. We found that the naturally recruited species were few, mostly common, and widely distributed species. A majority of the recruited species, including target species added as seeds into the sediments, emerged in all areas independent of the characteristics of the standing vegetation. We observed significant temporal changes in compositional patterns throughout the experimental period (May to October). These changes were especially pronounced in areas with fen/fen-meadow vegetation and were closely associated with the emergence and growth of species originating from the deposited sediments (e.g. Equisetum pratense, Poa trivialis, Urtica dioica), including the seeded target species (Lychnis flos-cuculi and Lotus pedunculatus) and with a decline in fen-associated mosses and small sedges. Compositional changes were also associated with shifts toward more productive species in areas previously dominated by low and intermediately productive species. We infer that flooding and sediment deposition play a limited role for recruitment of target species in riparian areas and that sediment deposition may entail a risk of losing diversity in riparian areas.

AB The diversity of origins of peatland basins in Central Poland allowed the peatlands to be distinguished by location (in valleys or upland mires) and by the processes forming their basins (e.g. glacigenic, aeolian, fluvial or thermokarst processes). Peats prevail in the structure of the sediments in the analysed basins of peatlands; among them the most predominant are fens, whereas the amount of raised bogs is low. In parts of the analysed objects there are lake sediments, which usually form the bottom sections of the profiles of the biogenic sediments, and were usually deposited in the Late Vistulian. In the Holocene, peat series were accumulated. In the examined peatlands located on morainic uplands, lacustrine sediments of the Late Vistulian and Early Holocene covered by Late Holocene peats are documented. Peatlands located near aeolian forms do not show evidence of continuous accumulation of biogenic deposits. They are particularly sensitive to changes in humidity and they underwent frequent modifications during phases of aeolian activity. The sediments of valley peatlands are not suitable objects for stratigraphic analyses, but they are appropriate for reconstructions of short events that occurred in the river valleys.

AB Peat is a common land surface material in many countries of the world and is particularly important in upland regions of the UK. Peat landscapes represent an important land use for hill fanning, water management, and shooting, and are a globally scarce resource. Wind is a fundamental characteristic of upland environments in the UK and has long been recognised as a significant factor in peat erosion. This paper presents the first results of a project that aims to determine the significance of wind action in the erosion of upland peat. Wind erosion monitoring is being undertaken at Moor House in the North Pennines on a 3-ha area of relatively flat, sparsely vegetated peat. Measurements using arrays of passive horizontal mass flux gauges (fixed orientation vertical slot gauges), together with a vertical array of mass flux samplers (directional), provide estimates of sediment flux. A micrometeorological station records local wind speed (four heights), wind direction, rainfall, soil moisture, and temperature conditions. For 1999 and 2000, the annual horizontal net erosion flux is 0.46 and 0.48 t ha(-1), respectively. Results of detailed monitoring over a 10-month period demonstrate that the peat sediment flux collected in windward- and leeward-oriented sediment traps on 10 separate occasions is between 3 and 12 times greater in the windward-facing traps. The concentration of peat with height decays rapidly and the majority of the peat is transported close to the ground surface. Above 0.3 m, very little peat is found. Significant horizontal fluxes of peat occur in both wet and dry periods. This is evaluated using the local micrometeorological data to try and predict sediment yields. Correlations among time-averaged friction velocity measurements, surface conditions, and sediment flux are complex. Event-based measurements, as opposed to cumulative sediment yields, are required to resolve this. These results quantify for the first time the significance of wind action in the erosion of peat in a UK upland environment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Restoration of rich fens is commonly attempted through local-scale measures, such as removal of sod or blockage of ditches. However, regional-scale restoration measures, that aim to re-establish the original hydrology in which rich fens developed, might have a more long-lasting effect. We investigated the effect of local- and regional-scale restoration measures on a vulnerable rich fen in the Naardermeer nature reserve in the Netherlands. We compared water quality and vegetation composition of the fen before and after the restoration measures, almost 30 years apart. Overall rich fen species increased and although this indicates the desired increased supply of fresh mineral-rich groundwater to the fen, continued succession towards poor fen vegetation has not been prevented in the entire fen. Despite sod layer removal, we observed an increase in aPolytrichum-dominated vegetation in patches that are primarily fed by rainwater. Our findings confirm results from a previous study which showed that brackish palaeo-groundwater is still contributing substantially to the water balance of the fen, especially in periods of precipitation deficit. We conclude that the local- and regional-scale restoration measures have been successful in increasing the abundance of rich fen species in parts of the fen. However, considering the pressures of climate change and high atmospheric N-deposition on the fen, it is uncertain whether rich fen species can be sustained in quite nutrient-poor conditions in the future. Therefore, there is a need for continued management that keeps the nutrient-poor and mineral-rich conditions of the fen intact.

AB Oil sands mining in the Athabasca oil sands region disturbs large tracts of peatlands as the vegetation-soil layer must be removed. Processing oil sands produces large volumes of wet material containing oil sand process-affected water (OSPW) that has elevated concentrations of sodium (Na) and naphthenic acids (NAs). Attempts to reclaim mined landscapes to peat-forming systems command knowledge of the transport, fate and impact of OSPW in organic soils. Four mesocosms placed in a greenhouse were randomly assigned with two treatments: 1) a moss carpet () and 2) graminoids ( and ). Transport of Na and NAs through peat was significantly delayed by sorption and diffusion in peat matrix. After two growing seasons of receiving OSPW, the graminoid plants continued to grow without showing stress from OSPW, while mosses showed a considerable decline in health. Microorganisms were more active under sedges than mosses and their activity varied over time either because of seasonal variation or as a consequence of variation in Na concentration. The findings of this study are limited due to the small number of replicates and the lack of a control, but represent a first step towards the creation of peatlands in the post-mined areas.

AB The carbon (C) storage of northern peatlands is equivalent to similar to 34-46% of the similar to 795Tg C currently held in the atmosphere as CO2. Most studies report that northern peatlands are a sink of between 20 and 60g CO2-C m(-2)yr(-1). Since peatland hydrology and biogeochemistry are very closely related to climate, there is concern whether northern peatlands will continue to function as C sinks with climate change. We used a coupled land surface scheme and peatland C model, called CLASS3W-MWM, to examine the sensitivity of peatland C to climate change. Based on the data available to constrain our model, we simulated the C dynamics of the Mer Bleue (MB) bog in eastern Canada and the Degero Stormyr (DS) poor fen in northern Sweden for four Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change scenarios, i.e., A1B, A2, B1, and Commit, over four time periods, i.e., present day, 2030, 2060, and 2100. When the simulated future C fluxes were compared to the baseline fluxes under the present climate conditions, we found that fens were much more sensitive to climate change than bogs. Gross primary production (GPP) at MB significantly increased by 4-44% up to 2100 for all scenarios except Commit. GPP at DS significantly decreased by 34-39% for A1B and A2, and slightly increased by 6-10% for B1 and Commit. Total ecosystem respiration (TER) significantly increased by 7-57% for MB and 4-34% for DS up to 2100 for all scenarios except Commit. Net ecosystem production (NEP), therefore, significantly decreased. The bog, however, was still a C sink up to 2100, though much reduced, but the fen switched to a C source for A1B and A2 scenarios. Additional experiments where we climatically transplanted the study peatlands or forced vegetation changes when the fen became too dry showed similar but less dramatic results as the standard runs. Our results indicate that northern peatlands should be included in the C-coupled climate model to fully understand the response of C cycling in terrestrial ecosystems to climate change and to reduce the uncertainties for projecting the future climate.

AB To determine whether a highly disturbed peatland ecosystem was successfully regenerating, we monitored the natural revegetation of a vacuum-mined bog located in southern Quebec that was abandoned in 1989 (Cacouna bog). Vegetation surveys were carried out in 1994 and 1998. The presence/absence of all species of vascular and non-vascular plants along eight 264-m long transects was noted in both years. The height structure of the invading birch (Betula spp.) population was also reconstructed in 1998. Only 11 plant species were sampled in 1994 at the vacuum-mined site. The 1998 survey added only five other species to the list. Nevertheless, the 1994 and 1998 vegetation surveys were significantly different, particularly because the cover of four ericaceous shrub species (Chamaedaphne calyculata, Kalmia! angustifolia, Ledum groenlandicum, Vaccinium angustifolium) had ir;creased since 1994. Height structure of the birch population indicated that seedlings were very numerous at the study site, but few of them will probably survive to their first or second growing season. This suggests that the natural revegetation of the Cacouna bog's vacuum-mined (mechanically harvested) site is slowly converging towards that of most block-cut mined (manually harvested) sites in southern Quebec; i.e., a dense plant cover dominated by ericaceous shrub species. However, no Sphagnum species had established eight years after abandonment of the vacuum-mined section. This indicates that the site is not returning to a functional peatland ecosystem. Additional restoration measures should be elaborated to accelerate the revegetation process.

AB Evidence for coupling between vegetation and soils is examined along a successional sequence from forest to bog in southeast Alaska. Soil morphology and taxonomy were determined at 19 sites along an 8-km transect extending from the coast to treeline on Kruzof Island. Patterns in soil development appear to be closely related with successional status of the vegetation at each site. During the succession from forest to bog, soils exhibit increased acidification, podzolization, placic horizon formation, and histosol development. Soil chemistry data from Kruzof Island suggest that bryophytes, especially Sphagnum mosses, play a critical role in acidification and podzolization of soils. Feedback effects of these soil processes should favor the development and spread of bog vegetation. The findings support the hypothesis that, due to the coupling of iron-bearing soils and vegetation, changes in soil morphology and chemistry along vegetation succession in upland northern forests favor the establishment and spread of climax bog communities.

AB 1. Peatlands have suffered great losses following drainage for agriculture, forestry, urbanisation, or peat mining, near inhabited areas. We evaluated the faunal and vegetation patterns after restoration of a peatland formerly mined for peat. We assessed whether bog pools created during restoration are similar to natural bog pools in terms of water chemistry, vegetation structure and composition, as well as amphibian and arthropod occurrence patterns.
   2. Both avian species richness and peatland vegetation cover at the site increased following restoration. Within bog pools, however, the vegetation composition differed between natural and man-made pools. The cover of low shrubs, Sphagnum moss, submerged, emergent and floating vegetation in man-made pools was lower than in natural pools, whereas pH was higher than in typical bog pools. Dominant plant species also differed between man-made and natural pools.
   3. Amphibian tadpoles, juveniles and adults occurred more often in man-made pools than natural bog pools. Although some arthropods, including Coleoptera bog specialists, readily colonised the pools, their abundance was two to 26 times lower than in natural bog pools. Plant introduction in bog pools, at the stocking densities we applied, had no effect on the occurrence of most groups.
   4. We conclude that our restoration efforts were partially successful. Peatland-wide vegetation patterns following restoration mimicked those of natural peatlands, but 4 years were not sufficient for man-made pools to fully emulate the characteristics of natural bog pools.

AB During succession, plant species composition undergoes changes that may have implications for ecosystem functions. Here we aimed to study changes in plant species diversity, functional diversity and functional traits associated with mire development. We sampled vegetation from 22 mires on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Bothnia (west coast of Finland) that together represent seven different time steps along a mire chronosequence resulting from post-glacial rebound. This chronosequence spans a time period of almost 2500 years. Information about 15 traits of vascular plants and 17 traits of mosses was collected, mainly from two different databases. In addition to species richness and Shannon diversity index, we measured functional diversity and community weighted means of functional traits. We found that plant species diversity increased from the early succession stages towards the fen-bog transition. The latter stage also has the most diverse surface structure, consisting of pools and hummocks. Functional diversity increased linearly with species richness, suggesting a lack of functional redundancy during mire succession. On the other hand, Rao's quadratic entropy, another index of functional diversity, remained rather constant throughout the succession. The changes in functional traits indicate a trade-off between acquisitive and conservative strategies. The functional redundancy, i.e. the lack of overlap between similarly functioning species, may indicate that the resistance to environmental disturbances such as drainage or climate change does not change during mire succession. However, the trait trade-off towards conservative strategy, together with the developing microtopography of hummocks and hollows with strongly differing vegetation composition, could increase resistance during mire succession.

Vegetation types are presented on a map and by phytosociological analysis. While the pollen frequencies and their relationships to vegetation type of some taxa are similar to those found elsewhere, Betula, Acer and Quercus are distinctively low in their representation, and Carpinus is significantly under-represented. Only those non-arboreal vegetation types with high frequencies of grasses were detectable in the pollen spectra.

AB 1 In a glasshouse experiment we studied the effect of raised CO2 concentration (720 p.p.m.) on CH4 emission at natural boreal peat temperatures using intact cores of boreal peat with living vascular plants and Sphagnum mosses. After the end of the growing season half of the cores were kept unnaturally warm (17-20 degrees C). The potential for CH4 production and oxidation was measured at the end of the emission experiment.
   2 The vascular cores ('Sedge') consisted of a moss layer with sedges, and the moss cores ('Sphagnum') of Sphagnum mosses (some sedge seedlings were removed by cutting). Methane efflux was 6-12 times higher from the Sedge cores than from the Sphagnum cores. The release of CH4 from Sedge cores increased with increasing temperature of the peat and decreased with decreasing temperature. Methane efflux from Sphagnum cores was quite stable independent of the peat temperatures.
   3 In both Sedge and Sphagnum samples, CO2 treatment doubled the potential CH4 production but had no effect on the potential CH4 oxidation. A raised concentration of CO2 increased CH4 efflux weakly and only at the highest peat temperatures (17-20 degrees C).
   4 The results suggest that in cool regions, such as boreal wetlands, temperature would restrict decomposition of the extra substrates probably derived from enhanced primary production of mire vegetation under raised CO2 concentrations, and would thus retard any consequent increase in CH4 emission.

AB Ombrotrophic bogs can comprise a mosaic of vegetation patches and open-water pools, with hydrological and biogeochemical connections between pools and the surrounding peat and vegetation. To establish these connections, we studied the spatial heterogeneity of hydrology and water chemistry in two zones of distinct vegetation assemblages in the subboreal Grande plee Bleue peatland, southern Quebec, Canada. We show that seasonal water-level fluctuations are greater and organic C, N and P concentrations are higher in the peat pore water of a forested zone than in a neighboring open-bog zone; that vegetation is responsible for 69% of the spatial variations in hydrology and water chemistry. Vegetation also explains 31% of the temporal variation in water chemistry, with higher increases in C, N and P concentrations over the growing season in the forested peat and pools than in the open-bog zone. We also show that C, N and P concentrations and water-level fluctuations in pools, especially during precipitation events, were lower than in the surrounding peat. Our results suggest the existence of small "watersheds" to the pools with water flowing in during wet and out during dry periods. Localized patterns emerge from the vegetation-hydrology-water chemistry interactions, with pools influencing the persistence of trees in the central part of an ombrotrophic bog.

AB Recent accelerated decay of discontinuous permafrost at the Stordalen Mire in northern Sweden has been attributed to increased temperature and snow depth, and has caused expansion of wet minerotrophic areas leading to significant changes in carbon cycling in the mire. In order to track these changes through time and evaluate potential forcing mechanisms, this paper analyses a peat succession and a lake sediment sequence from within the mire, providing a record for the last 100 years, and compares these with monitored climate and active layer thickness data. The peat core was analysed for testate amoebae to reconstruct changes in peatland surface moisture conditions and water table fluctuations. The lake sediment core was analysed by near infrared spectroscopy to infer changes in the total organic carbon (TOC) concentration of the lake-water, and changes in delta C-13 and C, N and delta N-15 to track changes in the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) pool and the influence of diagenetic effects on sediment organic matter, respectively. Results showed that major shifts towards increased peat surface moisture and TOC concentration of the lake-water occurred around 1980, one to two decades earlier than a temperature driven increase in active layer thickness. Comparison with monitored temperature and precipitation from a nearby climate station indicates that this change in peat surface moisture is related to June-September (JJAS) precipitation and that the increase in lake-water TOC concentration reflects an increase in total annual precipitation. A significant depletion in C-13 of sediment organic matter in the early 1980s probably reflects the effect of a single or a few consecutive years with anomalously high summer precipitation, resulting in elevated DIC content of the lake water, predominantly originating from increased export and subsequent respiration of organic carbon from the mire. Based on these results, it was not possible to link proxy data obtained on peat and lake-sediment records directly to permafrost decay. Instead our data indicate that increased precipitation and anomalously high rainfall during summers had a significant impact on the mire and the adjacent lake ecosystem. We therefore propose that effects of increased precipitation should be considered when evaluating potential forcing mechanisms of recent changes in carbon cycling in the subarctic.

AB The extent of drainage impact was studied in five transitional mires along a hydrosequence. The principal environmental variables driven by drainage are the minimum water level in the peat layer, together with the dry matter and total-N contents of peat. The drawdown effect of a cutoff ditch (intercepting surface and subsurface flow) on the minimum water level extends to a distance of 250-320 m. Peat water levels above -50 cm are associated with a sharp increase in Sphagnum cover, and the percentage of bog-specific species increases markedly when the minimum water level is higher than -25 cm. The girths and heights of trees and canopy closure of the tree layer decrease rapidly up to a distance of 200 m from the cutoff ditch. Negative impacts of the cutoff ditch on the canopy cover and average height of trees, estimated using LIDAR data, can be followed for distances up to 400 m and 350 m, respectively. The density and height of shrub stems start to increase at a distance of 16 m and continue to increase up to 400 m from the cutoff ditch. The percentage of bog-specific species increases up to a distance of 100 m, whilst the percentage of fen-specific species begins to decrease remarkably at a distance of about 200 m from the cutoff ditch.

AB Understanding the long-term ecological dynamics of northern peatlands is essential for assessment of the possible responses and feedbacks of these carbon-rich ecosystems to climate change and natural disturbance. I used high-resolution macrofossil and lithological analyses of a fen peatland in western Canada to infer the Holocene developmental history of the peatland, to document the temporal pattern of long-term peat accumulation, and to investigate ecosystems responses to climate changes in terms of species composition and carbon accumulation. The peatland has been dominated by sedges and brown mosses during its 10,000-year history, despite interruption by tephra deposition. Peat accumulation rates vary by more than an order of magnitude and decline from 5500 to 1300 cal BP, resulting in a convex depth-age curve, which contrasts with the carbon accumulation patterns documented for oceanic peatlands. The synthesis of regional data from continental western Canada indicates that fens tend to accumulate more carbon than bogs of the same ages. These data suggest that the carbon sink potential of northern peatlands has varied dramatically in the past, so estimates of the present and projected carbon sink strengths of these peatlands need to take this temporal variation into consideration. Widespread slowdown of peat accumulation over the last 4000 years may have resulted from climate cooling in northern latitudes after the Holocene insolation maximum. The findings indicate that long-term peatland dynamics are modified by many local and regional factors and that gradual environmental change may be capable of triggering abrupt shifts and jumps in ecosystem states.

AB Raised and transitional bogs are one of the most threatened types of ecosystem, due to high specialisation of biota, associated with adaptations to severe environmental conditions. The aim of the study was to characterize the relationships between functional diversity (reflecting ecosystem-shaping processes) of raised bog plant communities and successional gradients (expressed as tree dimensions) and to show how impacts of former clear cuts may alter these relationships in two raised bogs in 'Bory Tucholskie' National Park (N Poland). Herbaceous layers of the plant communities were examined by floristic releves (25 m(2)) on systematically established transects. We also assessed patterns of tree ring widths. There were no relationships between vegetation functional diversity components and successional progress: only functional dispersion was negatively, but weakly, correlated with median DBH. Lack of these relationships may be connected with lack of prevalence of habitat filtering and low level of competition over all the successional phases. Former clear cuts, indicated by peaks of tree ring width, influenced the growth of trees in the bogs studied. In the bog with more intensive clear cuts we found more species with higher trophic requirements, which may indicate nutrient influx. However, we did not observe differences in vegetation patterns, functional traits or functional diversity indices between the two bogs studied. We also did not find an influence of clear cut intensity on relationships between functional diversity indices and successional progress. Thus, we found that alteration of the ecosystems studied by neighbourhood clear cuts did not affect the bogs strongly, as the vegetation was resilient to these impacts. Knowledge of vegetation resilience after clear cuts may be crucial for conservation planning in raised bog ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB There is growing awareness that an intensification of the hydrological cycle associated with climate change in many parts of the world will have profound implications for river ecosystem structure and functions. In the present study we link an ensemble of regional climate model projections to a hydrological model with the aim to predict climate driven changes in flooding regimes in lowland riparian areas. Our specific aims were to (1) predict effects of climate change on flood frequencies and magnitudes in riparian areas by using an ensemble of six climate models and (2) combine the obtained predictions with the distribution of rich fen communities to explore whether these are likely to be subjected to increased flooding by a climate change induced increase in river runoff. We found that all regional climate models in the ensemble showed increases in mean annual runoff and that the increase continued through the two scenario periods, i.e. 2035-2065 and 2070-2099. We found concomitant increases in flood levels and flood frequencies. Flood levels and frequencies increased at sites both where the maximum water level was governed directly by river water runoff and where it was governed by river flow roughness (weed cover). We did not find evidence that the present flooding regime was an overall key factor determining the distribution of fen vegetation. However, with the predicted changes in flooding frequencies in the investigated areas we expect to see changes in species compositional patterns within the fen areas under a future climate that may affect the conservation value of these.

AB Bogs and fens from northern Minnesota produce large quantities of CH4, which may be either emitted to the atmosphere or stored in below-ground reservoirs. The identity of the organic materials that support CH4 production has been uncertain, but we present evidence that a significant fraction of surface emission and below-ground CH4 is derived from recently fixed organic compounds. First, the CH4 emitted from both bogs and fens has a C-14 signature equivalent to contemporary values for atmospheric CO2. Second, in flooded fens rates of CH4 emission are linearly related to rates of CO2 exchange and to the delta(13)C of emitted CH4. Third, peat-porewaters as deep as several meters below the surface contain mixtures of CH4 derived from both modern and older organic substrates. The source of the modern organic substrates is most likely dissolved organic compounds produced from the decay of recently produced litter, roots and root exudation products and transported into deeper layers of the peat. These data indicate that CH4 emissions are closely linked to the living vegetation and hydrology of northern peatlands and less dependent on the lability and decomposition of peat within the deeper layers of the catotelm.

AB The valley mire 'Mittletes Trebeltal' in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania (northeast Germany) has recently been re-wetted in the course of an EU-funded conservation project. On the basis of geological cross-sections, a hydrological model applying the Boussinesq-equation has been developed to investigate the hydrological dynamics of the study area and to evaluate various management strategies. Modelled water levels corresponded well to measured ones. The optimised values of two of the main model parameters-the hydraulic conductivity and the proportions of vegetation types-agreed with measurement values, and, respectively, the real vegetation cover, while the third one, the specific yield, should pragmatically be used as a calibration parameter. Due to a proportion of around 30% of tall fen vegetation, the modelled evapotranspiration clearly exceeded grass evapotranspiration resulting in low groundwater levels in some parts of the fen during summer. Generally, the water levels are controlled by topographic features (i.e. former peat cuttings) and weather conditions during the summer months. When analyzing different management scenarios, even an optimal water supply (ditch water levels near the ground surface) could not raise the groundwater table to ecologically sound levels during summer. However, during winter, these ditch water levels enhanced flooding. The groundwater fluxes towards the river, and, respectively, towards the fen were low. The minor importance of these fluxes for the water balance was caused by very low hydraulic gradients. Therefore, it can be concluded that the risk of nutrient export from the fen into the river is very limited and compound transformations take place within the mire system itself. Hydrological analysis as a prerequisite for the assessment of nutrient and pollutant transport and transformation processes can be carried out-as a first approach-with simple models on the basis of a limited dataset.

AB In the present study we reviewed the genesis, development and classification of peatlands in the Iberian Peninsula by conducting chronostratigraphic analysis of 108 of these ecosystems. The findings are summarised as follows:
   1. The region has a wide variety of peatlands which are classified according to their biogeochemical, geomorphological and ecological characteristics into different types of bogs and fens.
   2. Most of the peatlands occur in the Atlantic region followed by the Mediterranean and Alpine regions. Fens are more widely distributed than bogs, and blanket and raised bogs are mainly found in the Eurosiberian biogeographical region.
   3. In many of the fens, the last active peat-forming cycle occurred during the Late Holocene (43 %). In most of the bogs, the peat-forming cycle occurred in the Middle Holocene (70 %), although in a substantial proportion of blanket bogs these processes occurred in the Early Holocene (30 %).
   4. The peat formed in the last active cycle is, on average, thicker in raised bogs (322 cm) than in blanket bogs (257 cm) and fens (156 cm).
   5. Vertical peat accumulation rates varied between 16 and 30 yr cm(-1) in more than 40 % of the peatlands. The accumulation rates differed significantly between the different types of peatlands and were highest in the raised bogs. The accumulation rates were very variable in the fens.
   6. The genesis, evolution and types of Iberian peatlands are similar to those observed in peatlands in northern latitudes in Europe and North America.

AB Analysis of aerial photographs taken in 1958 and 1994 and their comparison with the published data have shown an increase in the area occupied by fully-stocked and scattered thickets of the dwarf pine Pinus mugho Turra (from 28.48 to 29.57 ha) in the Izera mountains at the cost of the open territories, whose area decreased fromr 2.4 to 0.62 ha. The scale of changes in the areas occupied by laggs or covered by spruce varied with reference to local conditions. The changes were caused by a lowered water level in the peat bogs due to the erosion activity Of the river and streams, artificial lowering of the water level by means of draining ditches, as well as reduced water retention and raised runoff from the adjacent areas resulting from large-area deforestation and changes in the forest stand structure and density.

AB On the basis of about 550 phytosociological releves, the vegetation of fens, springs and snow fields in Central West Greenland was arranged in 20 plant communities within 5 classes (Tab. 1). Soil chemical analyses comprise pH, C/N-ratio and content of organic matter. The communities of fens, cold springs, snow fields and scree were characterized floristically and ecologically (Tab. 2-5). The communities were described concerning their edaphical and hydrological niches; their total distribution is discussed. In most cases they occur widespread in arctic and boreo-alpine areas; their distribution is primarily determined by edaphical, not by climatical limitations. For the Caricetum holostomae and the Caricetum gynocratis a valid nomenclatural type releve is selected (Tab. 3). The Ledo decumbentis-Betuletum nanae is firstly described from acid fen hummocks (Tab. 4). The vegetation of cold springs, snow fields and moist solifluction scree is summarized in Tab. 5. A survey on bryophyte synusiae within the fen communities is presented in Tab 6. These communities are clearly separated according to the soil acidity and hydrological gradients. They occur widespread on microscale patterns with a more or less comparable species composition in arctic and boreal areas.

AB We studied natural and forestry-drained peatlands to examine the effect of over 34 years lowered water table on the delta C-13 values of vegetation, bulk peat and subsoil. In the seven studied sites, delta C-13 in the basal peat layer was 1.1 and 1.2 parts per thousand lower than that of the middle-layer and surface layer, respectively. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the delta C-13 values of the basal and surface peat layers, possibly due to carbon (C) recycling within the peat column. In the same mire complex, natural fen peat delta C-13 values were lower than those of the nearby bog, possibly due to the dominance of vascular plants on fen and the generally larger share of recycled C in the fens than in the bogs. Furthermore, natural and 51 years previously drained fen and bog, on the opposite sides of a ditch on the same mire complex, showed no significant differences in delta C-13 values. Plant delta C-13 values were lower, while delta C-13 values of subsoil were higher in the drained than in the natural site of the fen.

AB Relevance. The analysis of changes in chemical and mineral composition of peat and soils is the important stage of searches ofminerals, development of corresponding methodology, and methodology of ecological monitoring as well.
   The aim of the research is to reveal the changes in chemical composition of peat and soil acid extracts in east part of the Vasyugan mire.
   Methods: landscape-geochemical and statistical methods, methods of definition of chemical and mineral composition of peat and soils, imitating mathematical modelling.
   Results and conclusions. According to approbation of peats and mineral soils in March 2017 and 2018 in east part of the Vasyugan mire (Western Siberia, the Ob river basin, the Russian Federation) the authors have analyzed: chemical composition of acid extracts from peats and soils using 1CP MS; composition of mineral inclusions in peat and soils using the method of scanning electronic microscopy and XRD-analysis. Concentration of 73 chemical elements was determined and three groups of elements were allocated: 1) with rather steady increase from a surface to bottom soils and/or a strongly pronounced maximum in bottom soils; 2) with well expressed maxima in the top and bottom parts of peat deposits; 3) with other types of distribution. The major factors of spatial changes in chemical composition of peat and soils are mainly natural biogeochetnical conditions, water exchange intensity, ratio of the atmospheric and ground water and mineral feed which determine the common availability of water and nutrients for bog vegetation, removal of toxic substances for this vegetation.

AB Rates and delta C-13 values of CH4 flux are reported from an upland blanket mire (Blaen Fign) situated in Wales UK. The delta C-13 values of CH4 flux were similar from Sphagnum and vascular flora dominated areas despite flux rates being an order of magnitude greater from the latter. Methane flux was C-13-depleted relative to belowground CH4, indicating that transport occurred predominately via passive diffusion through vascular flora and that pore water diffusion and ebullition contributed little to CH4 flux. The strong influence of vascular flora abundance on CH4 flux strength suggests that any factors altering vegetation assemblages in blanket mires will likely impact CH4 emission rates. Methane flux from Blaen Fign was highly C-13-depleted compared to emissions from minerotrophic wetlands, suggesting that delta C-13 values may be useful for tracing CH4 flux from blanket mires and other types of ombrogenous peatlands to the global CH4 budget.

AB Management of peatlands for conservation purposes is often directed at mitigation of damaging impacts of past and present human activity. Assessment of such impacts is often based on perspectives from short-term ecological data. Here we test a series of hypotheses for the causes of changes in mire hydrology and vegetation on the Border Mires in northern England using palaeoecological data for the last 200 years. Ecological data suggest peatlands surrounded by plantation forestry have become drier over the last 40 years. This could be caused by direct hydrological impacts of the growing trees and associated drainage or indirectly by the cessation of grazing and burning. A third hypothesis is that hydrological changes are the result of recent climatic change. High-resolution water-table reconstructions from testate amoebae analysis supported by plant macrofossil analysis and dated by Pb-210, spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs) and pollen data demonstrate that a site outside the direct influence of forestry has also become drier during the twentieth century. This suggests that forestry is not the main cause of changes observed on other sites. Water-table declines began earlier than the main phase of forest planting and the magnitude of change appears to be similar to that on a site within the forest. Subjective comparisons of reconstructed water tables with meteorological data suggest that hydrological changes on the mires are primarily driven by summer temperature changes. If future regional climatic change predictions are correct, further water-table decline will follow and current management activities are unlikely to restore mires to their former condition.

AB Calcareous fens in Minnesota are spring-seepage peatlands with a distinctive flora of rare calciphilic species. Feat characteristics and groundwater geochemistry were determined for six calcareous fens in the Minnesota River Basin to better understand the physical structure and chemical processes associated with stands of rare vegetation. Onset of peat accumulation in three of the fens ranged from about 4,700 to 11,000 C-14 yrs BP and probably resulted from a combination of climate change and local hydrogeologic conditions. Most peat cores had a carbonate-bearing surface zone with greater than 10% carbonates (average 27%, dry wt basis), an underlying carbonate-depleted zone with 10% or less carbonates (average 4%), and a carbonate-bearing lower zone again with greater than 10% carbonates (average 42%). This carbonate zonation was hypothesized to result from the effect of water-table level on carbonate equilibria: carbonate precipitation occurs when the water table is above a critical level, and carbonate dissolution occurs when the water table is lower. Other processes that changed the major ion concentrations in upwelling groundwater include dilution by rain water, sulfate reduction or sulfide oxidation, and ion adsorption or exchange. Geochemical modeling indicated that average shallow water in the calcareous fens during the study period was groundwater mixed with about 6 to 13% rain water. Carbonate precipitation in the surface zone of calcareous fens could be decreased by a number of human activities, especially those that lower the water table. Such changes in shallow water geochemistry could alter the growing conditions that apparently sustain rare fen vegetation.

AB The mapping and monitoring of Swiss mires has so far relied on a classification system based on expert judgement, which was not supported by a quantitative vegetation analysis and which did not include all wetland vegetation types described in the country. Based on a spatially representative sample of 17,608 relev,s from 112 Swiss mires, we address the following questions: (1) How abundant are wetland vegetation types (phytosociological alliances) in Swiss mires? (2) How are they distributed across the country--is there a regional pattern? (3) How clearly are they separated from each other? (4) How clear and reliable is their ecological interpretation? Using published wetland vegetation relev,s and lists of diagnostic species for phytosociological units (associations and alliances) established by experts, we developed a numerical method for assigning relev,s to units through the calculation of similarity indices. We applied this method to our sample of 17,608 relev,s and estimated the total area covered by each vegetation type in Switzerland. We found that vegetation types not included in previous mapping were either rare in Switzerland (partly due to mire drainage) or poorly distinguished from other vegetation units. In an ordination, the Swiss mire vegetation formed a triangular gradient system with the Sphagnion medii, the Caricion davallianae and the Phragmition australis as extreme types. Phytosociological alliances were clearly separated in a subset of 2,265 relev,s, which had a strong similarity to one particular association, but poorly separated across all relev,s, of which many could not be unequivocally assigned to one association. However, ecological gradients were reflected equally well by the vegetation types in either case. Overall, phytosociological alliances distinguished until now proved suitable schemes to describe and interpret vegetation gradients. Nevertheless, we see the urgent need to establish a data base of Swiss wetland relev,s for a more reliable definition of some vegetation units.

AB Effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration on northern peatland biogeochemistry was studied in a short-term experiment. Eight intact soil cores (11-cm diameter x 40-cm depth) with Juncus and Festuca spp. were collected from a calcareous fen in north Wales. Half of the cores were incubated under 350 ppm CO2 concentration, whilst the other four cores were maintained at 700 ppm CO2. After a 4-month incubation, significantly higher biomass (root + shoot + algal mat) was determined under elevated CO2 conditions. Higher emissions of N2O and CO2 and higher concentration of pore-water DOC (dissolved organic carbon) were also observed under elevated CO2. However, no significant differences were found in CH4 emission or soil enzyme activities (beta -glucosidase, phosphatase, and N-acetylglucosaminidase) in the bulk soil. Overall, the results suggest that elevated CO2 would increase the primary productivity of the fen vegetation, and stimulate N2O and CO2 emissions as a consequence of an enhanced DOC supply from the vegetation to the soil microbes.

AB The historical development of the hydroseral vegetation of three humic lakes was studied. We applied a combination of methods to reconstruct the past vegetation (plant macroscopic remains, peat decomposition, sediment chemistry and radiocarbon dating). The contemporary environment of these lakes was assessed by vegetation and water chemistry analyses. The oldest foreshore sediments were formed 13075-12700 cal BP (Lake Suchar VI), 10115-9670 cal BP (Lake Suchar III) and 8747-8479 cal BP (Lake Widne). The differences in contemporary vegetation are reflected in the subfossil plant assemblages. From the beginning, poor fens and bogs occurred beside Lake Suchar III, moderately rich and poor fens were developed at Lake Suchar VI, while reedswamps and moderately rich fens occurred at Lake Widne. The foreshore vegetation changed over time but only within a restricted range, specific for each lake corresponding to the hydrochemical differences between the lakes. Lakes are classified as humic if some features are combined, such as the specific vegetation and water parameters. However, over the past few decades escalating climatic and anthropogenic changes could transform the character of these water bodies. The application of multidisciplinary methods permitted comparison of the development of three apparently similar lakes and identification of significant ecological differences.

AB Located on the western flank of the Changbai Mountains in Northeast China, Hani (HN) peatland has been studied intensively for Holocene paleoclimate reconstruction on decadal to centennial scales. This study presented new datasets of hydroclimatic controls on the distribution and abundance of mosses through modern vegetation survey and plant macrofossil analysis of a historical peat profile. Survey on the abundance of ten different moss species in 40 vegetation quadrats and their depths to water table (DWT) in the HN mire have been conducted during the growing season (June to October) in 2015 and 2016. Our results indicated that (1) the abundances of these mosses showed close relationship with DWTs; and (2) DWT was a function of local precipitation with lower DWT corresponding to higher precipitation. Sphagnum fallax, S. cuspidatum and S. subsecundum preferred wet microhabitats under higher precipitation (i.e., lower DWT), and vice versa. Hence, the variation in the abundance of these sphagna was considered to be an indicator of changes in precipitation. An equation for quantitative estimation of DWT based on the abundances of the moss species along different moisture habitats has been established based on the modern survey, which was able to reconstruct the variation of DWT in the past from plant macrofossil analysis.
   A 50 cm core from HN mire was dated by AMS C-14, Pb-210, and Cs-137 methods, providing a 50-year record of hydroclimate. Plant macrofossils were identified at 1 cm intervals of the peat core, which exhibited detailed variations of the moss assemblages. The variation of DWT reconstructed from the coverage of S. fallax and the total coverage of S. fallax, S. cuspidatum and S. subsecundum in the core matched well in peak-to-peak and trough-to-trough with local growing season precipitation on annual scale during the past 50 years. Our study suggests that selecting well-responsive Sphagnum species is a key factor to reconstruct hydroclimate by using plant macrofossils.

TI North American approach to the restoration of Sphagnum dominated
   peatlands

LA English

   revegetation; technique
AB Sphagnum dominated peatlands do not rehabilitate well after being cutover (mined) for peat and some action needs to be taken in order to restore these sites within a human generation. Peatland restoration is recent and has seen significant advances in the 1990s. A new approach addressing the North American context has been developed and is presented in this paper. The short-term goal of this approach is to establish a plant cover composed of peat bog species and to restore a water regime characteristic of peatland ecosystems. The long-term objective is to return the cutover areas to functional peat accumulating ecosystems. The approach developed for peatland restoration in North America involves the following steps: 1) field preparation, 2) diaspore collection, 3) diaspore introduction, 4) diaspore protection, and 5) fertilization. Field preparation aims at providing suitable hydrological conditions for diaspores through creation of microtopography and water retention basins, re-shaping cutover fields and blocking ditches. It is site specific because it depends largely on local conditions. The second step is the collection of the top 10 centimetres of the living vegetation in a natural bog as a source of diaspores. It is recommended to use a ratio of surface collected to surface restored between 1: 10 and 1: 15 in order to minimize the impact on natural bogs and to insure rapid plant establishment in less than four years. Diaspores are then spread as a thin layer on the bare peat surfaces to be restored. It has been demonstrated that too scant or too thick a layer decreases plant establishment success. Diaspores are then covered by a straw mulch applied at a rate of 3 000 kg ha(-1) which provides improved water availability and temperature conditions. Finally, phosphorus fertilization favours more rapid substrate colonization by vascular plants, which have been shown to help stabilize the bare peat surface and act as nurse plants to the Sphagnum mosses.

AB To test the hypothesis that long-term peat accumulation is related to contemporary carbon flux dynamics, we present the Peat Decomposition Model (PDM), a new model of long-term peat accumulation. Decomposition rates of the deeper peat are directly related to observable decomposition rates of fresh vegetation litter, Plant root effects (subsurface oxygenation and fresh litter inputs) are included. PDM considers two vegetation types, vascular and nonvascular, with different decomposition rates and aboveground and belowground litter input rates. We used PDM to investigate the sensitivities of peat accumulation in bogs and fens to productivity, root:shoot ratio, tissue decomposability, root and water table depths, and climate. Wanner and wetter conditions are more conducive to peat accumulation. Bogs are more sensitive than fens to climate conditions. Cooler and drier conditions lead to the lowest peat accumulation when productivity is more temperature sensitive than decomposition rates. We also compare peat age-depth profiles to field data. With a very general parameterization, PDM fen and bog age-depth profiles were similar to data from the the most recent 5000 years at three bog cores and a fen core in eastern Canada, but they overestimated accumulation at three other bog cores in that region. The model cannot reliably predict the amount of fen peat remaining from the first few millennia of a peatland's development. This discrepancy may relate to nonanalogue, early postglacial climatic and nutrient conditions for rich-fen peat accumulation and to the fate of this fen peat material, which is overlain by a bog as the peatland evolves, a common hydroseral succession in northern peatlands. Because PDM sensitivity tests point to these possible factors, we conclude that the static model represents a framework that shows a consistent relationship between contemporary productivity and fresh-tissue decomposition rates and observed long-term peat accumulation.

AB Question: Why do similar fen meadow communities occur in different landscapes? How does the hydrological system sustain base-rich fen mires and fen meadows?
   Location: Interdunal wetlands and heathland pools in The Netherlands, percolation mires in Germany, Poland, and Siberia, and calcareous spring fens in the High Tatra, Slovakia.
   Methods: This review presents an overview of the hydrological conditions of fen mires and fen meadows that are highly valued in nature conservation due to their high biodiversity and the occurrence of many Red List species. Fen types covered in this review include: (1) small hydrological systems in young calcareous dune areas, and (2) small hydrological systems in decalcified old cover sand areas in The Netherlands; (3) large hydrological systems in river valleys in Central-Europe and western-Siberia, and (4) large hydrological systems of small calcareous spring fens with active precipitation of travertine in mountain areas of Slovakia.
   Results: Different landscape types can sustain similar nutrient poor and base-rich habitats required by endangered fen meadow species. The hydrological systems of these landscapes are very different in size, but their groundwater flow pattern is remarkably similar. Paleo-ecological research showed that travertine forming fen vegetation types persisted in German lowland percolation mires from 6000 to 3000 BP. Similar vegetation types can still be found in small mountain mires in the Slovak Republic. Small pools in such mires form a cascade of surface water bodies that stimulate travertine formation in various ways. Travertine deposition prevents acidification of the mire and sustains populations of basiphilous species that elsewhere in Europe are highly endangered.
   Conclusion: Very different hydrological landscape settings can maintain a regular flow of groundwater through the top soil generating similar base-rich site conditions. This is why some fen species occur in very different landscape types, ranging from mineral interdunal wetlands to mountain mires.

AB Questions: Is vegetation composition of ombrotrophic bogs with an undisturbed water regime resistant or sensitive to ongoing high atmospheric deposition and climatic changes?
   Location: The Sudeten Mountains (Czech Republic).
   Methods: Species composition of bryophytes and vascular plants was sampled in 25 permanent plots in suboceanic bogs of the Jizerske hory Mountains and in 26 permanent plots in subcontinental bogs of the Hruby Jesenik Mountains. The permanent plots were established and first sampled in 1991. These plots were re-sampled after 14 and 17 years, respectively. We also used historical vegetation plots (1947-1949; 1980) from the same localities in order to reveal possible changes that might start earlier. Water chemistry was analysed annually, usually three times a year. Compositional changes were analysed by PERMANOVA, beta-diversity changes by PERMDISP and other changes by t-test and Fisher's exact test.
   Results: At the community level, no statistically significant changes were detected in permanent plots (PERMANOVA, PERMDISP), either in hollows or in hummocks, but the vegetation composition changed between the oldest (historical) and the newest data sets. At the level of functional groups, cover of Cyperaceae significantly decreased and cover of other herbs (excluding graminoids) and Sphagna increased in the Hruby Jesenik Mountains, whereas no changes were detected in the Jizerske hory Mountains. Cover of ericoid dwarf shrubs has not changed in either area. At the level of particular species, the frequency of Sphagnum magellanicum, Carex limosa, Scheuchzeria palustris and Vaccinium myrtillus decreased, while the frequency of Straminergon stramineum, Sphagnum recurvum agg., Eriophorum angustifolium and Luzula sylvatica increased. These changes were more evident when recent and historical data were compared.
   Conclusions: When water regime is not affected, the bog vegetation seems to be rather resistant to high atmospheric deposition and climate fluctuation. A significant change of the species composition occurs only in the long-term perspective. Particular species could, however, decrease or increase their frequencies more rapidly. For some of these species a positive or negative response to nitrogen availability was also found in other studies, whereas for other species further research is needed in order to separate the effects of atmospheric deposition and internal ecosystem dynamics.

AB The response of peatlands to climate change can be highly variable. Through understanding past changes we can better predict the response of peatlands to future climate change. We use a multi-proxy approach to reconstruct the surface wetness and carbon accumulation of the Mukhrino mire (Western Siberia), describing the development of the mire since peat formation in the early Holocene, around 9360 cal. year BP. The mire started as a rich fen which initiated after paludification of a spruce forest (probably in response to a wetter climate), while the Mukhrino mire progressed to ombrotrophic bog conditions (8760 cal. year BP). This transition coincided with the intensive development of mires in Western Siberia and was associated with active carbon accumulation (31 g m(-2) year(-1)). The ecosystem underwent a change to a tree-covered state around 5860 cal. year BP, likely in response to warming and possible droughts and this accompanied low carbon accumulation (12 g m(2) year(-1)). If the future climate will be warmer and wetter, then regional mires are likely to remain a carbon sink, alternatively, a reversion to the wooded state with reduced carbon sink strength is possible.

AB The nitrogen (N) supply is limited in many peatlands, and the mineralization of organic matter represents a major source of N to plants. The goal of this paper is to establish the relationship between decomposition rates, mineralization rates, and the N concentration of peat along a peatland gradient in four peatlands in western, boreal Canada. The four peatlands differ physically, chemically, and floristically and include a bog, a poor fen, and two moderate-rich fens, one wooded and the other open. The fens are enriched by ground water inputs, which we hypothesized led to higher concentrations of N in peat, faster decomposition of litter, and higher N mineralization rates. Net N mineralization was virtually identical to net ammunification over a 2-y period, both measured using an in situ incubation technique. Net daily mineralization rates increased from the bog to the open, moderate-rich fen, with intermediate values in the poor fen and moderate-rich wooded fen. This increasing trend along the bog-open, moderate-rich fen peatland gradient was mirrored for mineralization rates on a temporal and spatial basis. Virtually no nitrification was detected in any of the sites. Estimated aboveground integrated ecosystem decomposition rates ranged from 17%(.)y(-1) in the bog to 31%(.)y(-1) in the wooded, moderate-rich fen. Decomposition rates were significantly correlated with the mean daily net N mineralization rate and with total N in the upper 20 cm of peat. The net mineralization rate also was positively correlated with the total N content of the peat in 1991. The total N content of the peat increased from 5.8 mg(.)g(-1) in the bog to 11.5 mg(.)g(-1) in the open, moderate-rich fen, with poor fen and moderate-rich wooded fen values intermediate. The total C content of the peat ranged from 3 70 to 400 mg(.)g(-1) and was not significantly different among the four peatlands. TC:TN quotients for the peat cores were 68 in the bog and 36-38 in the fens, correlating negatively with net ammonification rates. Based on our data, the processes of mineralization of N and decomposition are tightly linked processes, both of which were higher in the fens than in the bog in our four western continental peatlands. Moreover, both processes are more affected by the quality of the organic matter, as indicated by the TC:TN quotients of the surface peat, than by surface water chemistry variables.

AB Terrestrialization stages of mire vegetation are important to Dutch nature conservancy because of high biodiversity, particularly of base-rich fens. In recent turbaries, terrestrialization has however not shown development of such a stage, while existing rich fens show accelerated development towards species-poor Sphagnum-dominated vegetation, due to acidification and lack of base-rich water input. We apply the analysis of microfossils and macroremains in two peat cores in order to get a better understanding of terrestrialization in the past, and thus provide information on actual vegetation successions, which is directly relevant to nature conservation.
   The sampling site Stobbenribben showed a vegetation succession under relatively nutrient-poor conditions. The site at Westbroek underwent two peat digging events with one vegetation sequence starting in the 16th/17th century under nutrient-poor conditions, and another during the last century under relatively nutrient-rich conditions. Results from Westbroek showed that if the pond is shallow, rich-fen bryophytes develop relatively close to the bottom of newly formed peat, due to structural support by species such as Equisetum fluviatile and Schoenoplectus lacustris. For Stobbenribben, where the pond is much deeper, rich-fen bryophytes only established after development of a floating root mat with Stratiotes aloides. For both Stobbenribben and 20th century Westbroek, the base-rich fen stage took 60 years to establish and remained for only 30 years without additional input of base-rich water.
   Our palaeoecological records can be used to provide a longer temporal perspective to address conservation issues of base-rich fens. We conclude that digging up new turf ponds may not be enough to meet the obligations, of the Natura 2000 Habitat Directive, if extra measures to prolong the lifespan of rich fens through e.g. temporary inundations with base-rich and nutrient-poor water are not taken into account.

AB In southern South America, a sharp macroclimatic gradient is found, triggered by the Pacific oceanic influence through the Andes. Mires are substantial landscape units along the gradient, where they play varying roles through the area and include varying plant communities. In this study, we analysed the relationship between vegetation and main abiotic factors in the minerotrophic mires (fens) at two different scales. We chose three fens in Isla Grande from Cordillera and Magellanic Steppe zones and their ecotone. There we characterized the distinct habitats by means of monitoring the water table fluctuations, the peat and the groundwater chemistry, and the vascular plant species composition. The main floristic patterns were revealed by means of classification and ordination of 75 vegetation plots. Thus, we classified the releves through multivariate analyses into six plant community types, two of which found in each fen. Behind the floristic distinctiveness of each site and each community type, structural vegetation descriptors such as species richness were similar. Overall, water table variables and groundwater chemistry showed the most important environmental differences between fens. Our data point that the main environmental force driving vegetation patterns was the macroclimatic gradient, which shapes the regional floristic pools. This gradient would be also responsible for modifying the local conditions of the fen habitats, mostly in the form of broadening the hydrological conditions within the fens of the Steppe. At each fen, the hydrological regime is the main factor in the distribution of vascular plants, particularly through the varying water table depths.

AB The ants Formica podzolica, Myrmica fracticornis and M. incompleta commonly build nests in a large peatland complex in N-central Montana. Nests of Formica are much larger than those of Myrmica spp. and occur in a microtopographic mosaic of hummocks and hollows. The large mound nests of F. podzolica and the hummocks are similar in size, and both had elevated levels of K, PO4- Mg and Na compared to the peatland surface, suggesting that the hummock are abandoned ant mounds. Ant mounds provide an environment for plants that has better aeration and is warmer as well as nutrient-enriched. A few species of strongly rhizomatous graminoids occur enactive mounds, but abandoned nests (hummocks) provide habitat for larger shrubs as well as many species of plants that otherwise could not grow in the cold, nearly saturated pear. Formica workers obtain much of their nutrition by tending aphids that feed on the shrubs growing on hummocks. We hypothesize that this is a positive feedback relationship that has promoted the increase of Formica colonies and allowed them to permanently change the structure and composition of a large portion of the vegetation in this rich fen.

AB Stable carbon-isotope ratios (C-13/C-12) and the abundance of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur were measured in flora and soil organic matter from the Sifton Bog and Point Pelee Marsh, which are located in the temperate climatic zone of southwestern, Ontario, Canada. Characteristic bog vegetation contains less N and S than marsh flora; however, invasive species (e.g., Typha) at the Sifton Bog have N and S contents that are similar to vegetation from the Point Pelee Marsh. Flora from both wetlands have delta(13)C values that are similar and characteristic of vegetation possessing the C-3 photosynthetic pathway. The only exception is Utricularia vulgaris L. at the Point Pelee Marsh, which is C-13-enriched (average delta(13)C = -18.4 parts per thousand; range -18.8 to -17.6 parts per thousand) probably because of CO2 limitation during growth. Organic matter from peat soils at each wetland exhibits a similar depth distribution of C:N ratios and delta(13)C values. The C:N ratio of soil organic matter decreases with depth, consistent with consumption of labile carbohydrates and fixation of nitrogen by soil microorganisms. Both C:N ratios and delta(13)C values stabilize at a shallow depth in soils at the Point Pelee Marsh, consistent with greater decay efficiency and less recalcitrant vegetation in marsh than in bog environments. Paleovegetational changes associated with a fen to bog succession also may have contributed to the more gradual and larger change in delta(13)C values and C:N ratios observed for soil organic matter at the Sifton Bog.

AB Past vegetation assemblages, preserved in peat layers, are one of the key proxies when reconstructing historical peatland dynamics. Northern peatlands can be divided into two main types: fens and bogs. Compared with bog peat, the fen peat is usually more decomposed because of different eco-hydrological conditions and effective humification processes. A high level of decomposition hampers reliable identification of plant remains and constrains palaeoecological approaches. Biogeochemical studies on bog plants and bog peat have shown that plant group-specific biomarkers can be applied to identify fossil plants or plant groups from peat, given the identification of plant group-specific markers in living fen plants. In this study, we applied plant macrofossil, biomarkers and multivariate statistical analyses to two mid-boreal peat sequences to investigate whether biomarkers can be applied to distinguish fen and bog environments and whether plant-specific biomarkers can be identified from fen peat. Macrofossil analyses clearly separate dry bog hummocks, moist lawns and wet fen habitats apart. Corresponding division emerged when the biomarker data were combined with the macrofossil data. Moreover, we succeeded to separate bog and fen habitats apart by the changes in n-alkane and the n-alkane ratio distributions along the cores. The fen-bog transition zone was indicated by high sterol and triterpenoid concentrations and changes in degradation measures. However, it remains a challenging task to attain species-level information of past plant assemblages from highly humified fen peat layers based on biomarkers only.

AB We reconstructed peatland formation, succession and long-term rates of carbon (C) accumulation at a mid-elevation poor fen on Vancouver Island in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Multi-proxy paleoecological analyses including bulk chemistry, peat composition, macrofossils, pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs show terrestrialization starting from a small oligotrophic lake 14,000 cal BP. Peat accumulation began by 11,600 cal BP with the transition to an emergent Nuphar-dominated shallow-water marsh. Terrestrialization in the center of the peatland was more or less complete by 10,400 cal BP with the development of a Sphagnum-dominated poor fen that continues to the present. Outward expansion by paludification appears to have brought the peatland close to its modern lateral extent by 10,000 cal BP, suggesting that terrestrialization and paludification played important concurrent roles in the early development of this poor fen. Mean long-term rates of C accumulation (13 g C/m(2)/yr) are lower than at most Northern Hemisphere peatlands including nearby lowland bogs. Maximum rates of 43 g C/m(2)/yr occurred in the early Holocene during accumulation of Nuphar peat and the transition to Sphagnum peat and coincided with high summer temperatures and increased seasonality, which promote growing season productivity and reduce winter decomposition. Early Holocene increases in C accumulation rates occurred at two nearby lowland bogs during similar wetland stages. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that climate and autogenic succession, including changes in relative water table depth and plant functional groups, interacted to drive Holocene peatland dynamics and C accumulation rates in the maritime setting of coastal British Columbia.

AB Using the characteristic of accumulated woody debris, data on vegetation, and data on previous climate fluctuations, we reconstructed the history of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) encroachment and retreat in a raised bog. The available patchy information on plant cover allowed us to pinpoint events in the development of pine seedlings and the first cases of trees dying off on the time scale. The results obtained show that the process of natural bog afforestation and deforestation was very dynamic and lasted only 22 years. These short-term changes in the tree populations were clearly linked to short-term climate fluctuations. The annual precipitation and mean temperature of winter months were the most important variables and the main factors directly influencing the young woodland. We assumed that the woody remnants represent the last stage of the contemporary phase of high germination and dying-off (GDO) of pine trees. The spatial distribution of woody debris and its characteristics indicate the naturalness of vegetation during this temporary 'woodland phase'.
   The study show that the investigation of woody debris can be used to further improve our understanding of bog vegetation dynamics, especially with regard to the influence of periodical climate fluctuations on transitions between open and forested peatland.

AB Restoration of wet grassland communities on peat soils involves management of nutrient supply and hydrology. The concept of nutrient limitation was discussed as well as its interaction with drainage and rewetting of severely drained peat soils. Different methods of assessing nutrient limitation were compared and the type and extent of nutrient limitation were determined for several wet grassland communities. It was concluded that a full-factorial field fertilisation experiment is the most preferable method. Plant tissue analyses and soil chemical analyses were considered less suitable, although they may provide helpful additional information. Fertilisation experiments in the laboratory using sods or using test plants appear to be the proper means to study mechanisms or processes, but have a restricted predictive value for field situations. Generalising the results, it seems that many relativily undisturbed grassland plant communities on peaty soils are characterised by N limitation. Phosphate limitation for vegetation on peat soils is mainly observed in specific circumstances such as extreme calcium richness, high concentrations of Fe or as a result of drainage or long-term hay cropping. The latter two may also cause K limitation. Rewetting is regarded as a prerequisite in restoring wet grassland communities. Further restoration measures to influence nutrient availability depend on aims of the management and the individual site conditions.

AB The moss layer transfer technique removes the top layer of vegetation from donor sites as a method to transfer propagules and restore degraded or reclaimed peatlands. As this technique is new, little is known about the impacts of moss layer transfer on vegetation and carbon fluxes following harvest. We monitored growing season carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes as well as plant communities at donor sites and neighbouring natural peatland sites in an ombrotrophic bog and minerotrophic fen in Alberta, Canada from which material was harvested between 1 and 6 years prior to the study. Plant recovery at all donor sites was rapid with an average of 72% total plant cover one growing season after harvest at the fen and an average of 87% total plant cover two growing seasons after harvest at the bog. Moss cover also returned, averaging 84% 6 years after harvest at the bog. The majority of natural peatlands in western Canada are treed and tree recruitment at the donor sites was limited. Methane emissions were higher from donor sites compared to natural sites due to the high water table and greater sedge cover. Carbon budgets suggested that the donor fen and bog sites released higher CO2 and CH4 over the growing season compared to adjacent natural sites. However, vegetation re-establishment on donor sites was rapid, and it is possible that these sites will return to their original carbon-cycle functioning after disturbance, suggesting that donor sites may recover naturally without implementing management strategies.

SO MIRES AND PEAT

DE blanket mire; fen; mesotope; peat depth; wind farms
AB Blanket bogs are rare types of peatland that are recognised internationally for important habitat provision, and nationally and locally as important carbon stores and sinks. These ecosystems enjoy particular attention and protection within the European Union, but gaps highlighted in the Spanish national peatland inventory leave many areas of Spain's blanket bog habitat unprotected and exposed to anthropogenic pressures such as livestock or wind farm development. This research identifies and offers classification of four currently unmapped areas of blanket bog located in the Cordillera Cantabrica (north Spain) on the administrative boundaries between the regions of Cantabria and Castilla y Leon. Peat depth was surveyed on a 15 m spaced grid at all sites and mesotope units were defined from topography and hydrological flow patterns. Two sloping and two mound blanket bogs were identified containing a range of bog and fen mesotope units. Maximum peat depth at the five sites ranges from 1.78 to 2.82 m covering an area of 43 ha of blanket bog (>30 cm peat depth). The survey also estimates that more than 300,000 m(3) of peat has accumulated across all sites. This study adds significantly to the known global distribution of blanket mire and suggests that an urgent update of national peatland inventories is needed more widely, not least in Spain, to identify currently unmapped areas of blanket bog. The approach used here can be employed wherever blanket mires occur in the world to promote their designation and the preservation of peatland diversity and carbon storage.

AB As one of the most important ecosystems, wetlands are threatened from both natural and anthropogenic activities. Mapping wetland is one of the curtail needs in order to prevent further loss. Since the beginning of the Remote Sensing revolution, different approaches using satellite images have been used for mapping and monitoring wetlands.
   In this paper we investigate the potential of the recently launched Sentinel satellites, both separate and in combination, for accurately mapping of different wetland classes using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) learning classifier. For investigating the influence of the Sentinel-2 red-edge bands, and the radar bands from Sentinel-1, three different datasets have been analyzed.
   The results showed that for more accurate mapping of different wetland classes, different datasets should be used. Thus, the red-edge bands have significant influence over the intensive vegetated wetland classes such as swamps, and the radar bands have significant influence over partially decayed vegetated wetland areas such as bogs. For future studies, in addition to the analyzed datasets, we recommend adding and investigating several vegetation indices for mapping and monitoring wetland areas.

AB We compared the CO2 exchange and its controls in the plant communities of a strongly patterned aapa mire, the Kaamanen fen in northern Finland. Based on a systematic vegetation inventory and an ordination analysis, four plant community types were chosen for the study: Ericales-Pleurozium string tops, Betula-Sphagnum string margins, Trichophorum tussock flarks and Carex-Scorpidium wet flarks. We measured plant community CO2 exchange with a closed chamber technique during the growing season of 2007 and early summer of 2008. Nonlinear regression models were used for simulating the CO2 exchange over the measurement period for different mire components and for the whole mire. The CO2 exchange dynamics distinguished two functional components in the mire: an ombrotrophic component (Ericales-Pleurozium string tops) and a minerotrophic component (other plant community types). Minerotrophic plant communities responded similarly to environmental controls, the most important of these being variation in leaf area and aerobic peat volume (water level). The ombrotrophic component dynamics were more obscure; frost and possibly peat moisture played a role. The minerotrophic communities functioned as effective CO2 sinks in the simulation, while the net CO2 exchange of the ombrotrophic community was close to zero. The smaller NEE of the ombrotrophic community was due to less efficient photosynthesis per unit leaf area in combination with high ecosystem respiration resulting from a large aerobic peat volume. Our study shows that a fen/bog functional dichotomy can also exist within one mire. Wet minerotrophic communities within northern mires can act as effective CO2 sinks.

AB Associated with the development of the oil sands resource in northern Alberta, Canada are elevated emissions of NOx and SOx from diesel-fueled vehicle and upgrader stack emissions. Ultimately these emissions are returned to regional terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the form of elevated atmospheric N and S deposition. About 30 % of the regional landscape is covered with peatlands, including ombrotrophic bogs that receive nutrient inputs solely from the atmosphere. From 2009 to 2014 we examined the effects of N and S deposition on Sphagnum fuscum growth and on recent net accumulation of C, N, and S in peat in six bogs, located between 11 and 251 km from the oil sands industrial center. Averaged across all sites and years, average deposition of NH4 (+)-N, NO3 (-)-N, DIN, SO4 (2-)-S, Ca2+, Mg2+, and ortho-P was 0.52, 0.64, 1.17, 7.70, 10.04, 3.29, and 0.15 kg ha(-1) year(-1). Deposition of NO3 (-)-N, DIN, SO4 (2-)-S, Ca2+, and Mg2+ decreased exponentially with distance from the industrial center. Averaged across all sites and years, vertical growth and NPP of S. fuscum was 16.6 +/- 0.6 mm and 259 +/- 9 g m(-2) per growing season, increasing exponentially with proximity to the industrial center. Correlations suggested that climatic factors, and in particular late growing season precipitation and the growing season Aridity Index (potential evapotranspiration to precipitation ratio) may be more important than the chemistry of atmospheric deposition in affecting S. fuscum growth. Across all sites and years, net C, N, and S accumulation in peat over the most recent 25 years averaged 67, 1.29, and 0.30 g m(-2) year(-1) and increased with proximity to the industrial center. Over the past 25-50 years, net C, N, and S accumulation in peat was lower than in surface peat, with only net S accumulation exhibiting an increase with proximity to the industrial center. In a region where bogs have persisted on the landscape for millennia with low atmospheric deposition of elements, changing precipitation chemistry, and in particular elevated deposition of N, S, Ca and Mg, related to oil sands development is influencing bog function, as evidenced by S. fuscum growth and biogeochemical responses.

AB A one-meter long peat core was taken from the peatland in Wolbrom (Silesian-Cracovian Upland, southern Poland). The analysis of the botanical composition showed that Wolbrom is a fen. Vegetation species such as Carex rostrata and Phragmites australis have been found. An age-depth model was constructed using 12 conventional radiocarbon dates and 13 lead-210 dates from the upper part of the deposit. In this work, the results of radiocarbon dating are presented. According to the model, we can estimate the age of the fen. The oldest part comes from a depth of 1.05 meter and its conventional age is 5940 +/- 95 BP (modelled date 5000-4790 BC, 68.2% probability interval). The accumulation rate varies between approximately 0.53 mm.yr(-1) and 6.48 mm.yr(-1). The core has been also tested for the presence of trace elements (Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) using ICP-OES. There are considerable variations in the concentrations of the tested metals - in many cases the concentration starts to rise at about 40 cm and may be connected with the human activity. This depth corresponds to the modelled age intervals 355-300 BC (17.4%) and 205-45 BC (50.7%).

AB Future climate change and other anthropogenic activities are likely to increase nutrient availability in many peatlands, and it is important to understand how these additional nutrients will influence peatland carbon cycling. We investigated the effects of nitrogen and phosphorus on aerobic CH4 oxidation, anaerobic carbon mineralization ( as CO2 and CH4 production), and anaerobic nutrient mineralization in a bog, an intermediate fen, and a rich fen in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We utilized a 5-week laboratory nutrient amendment experiment in conjunction with a 6-year field nutrient fertilization experiment to consider how the relative response to nitrogen and phosphorus differed among these wetlands over the short and long term. Field fertilizations generally increased nutrient availability in the upper 15 cm of peat and resulted in shifts in the vegetation community in each peatland. High nitrogen concentrations inhibited CH4 oxidation in bog peat during short-term incubations; however, long-term fertilization with lower concentrations of nitrogen stimulated rates of CH4 oxidation in bog peat. In contrast, no nitrogen effects on CH4 oxidation were observed in the intermediate or rich fen peat. Anaerobic carbon mineralization in bog peat was consistently inhibited by increased phosphorus availability, but similar phosphorus additions had few effects in the intermediate fen and stimulated CH4 production and nutrient mineralization in the rich fen. Our results demonstrate that nitrogen and phosphorus are important controls of peatland microbial carbon cycling; however, the role of these nutrients can differ over the short and long term and is strongly mediated by peatland type.

AB The study examined the effect of variation in hydrology on seedling recruitment of shrubs, trees and herbs in peat bogs. The establishment of plants and hydrologic conditions were followed in two peatlands in the Polesie Zachodnie region, Eastern Poland. Meteorological conditions in the study sites ranged from very dry (2006) to very wet (2007) and strongly affected ground water level in the bogs. The emergence of woody species typical for advanced vegetation succession was higher in forest-bog, while the recruitment of typical peat bog plants was higher in open bog. Disturbance in the vegetation positively influenced emergence of typical peat bog species and Betula pubescens, but the effect was only found in the dry year. Only in Pinus sylvestris did recruitment increase in wet seasons. The results suggested that an increase in the number of woody species in peat bogs may be enhanced during relatively wet seasons and that disturbance in the vegetation cover are not required for seedling recruitment of these plants.

AB Peatland complexes in the humid highlands of Hawai'i are vital refuges of biodiversity and freshwater resources. Hawaiian peat deposits are also rare repositories of terrestrial ecosystem archives located in an otherwise vast expanse of ocean. We investigated the potential for researching the paleohydrological history of Hawaiian montane peatlands on Kohala, Hawai'i Island through analyses of testate amoebae and Cladocera. Surface peat was collected from a variety of ecohydrological habitats (from water pools to hummocks) and analyzed for modern testate amoeba and cladoceran species relative abundance. We identified 54 morphotype taxa from 21 genera of testate amoebae, 4 taxa and genera of littoral Cladocera, and the common peat rotifer Habrotrocha angusticollis. Testate amoeba diversity and morphotype occurrence mirrored observations from many high-latitude peatland studies. Constrained and unconstrained ordinations support the hypothesis that surface moisture, measured as water-table depth, is an important control on the distribution of testate amoebae and Cladocera in Hawaiian peatlands. Transfer functions relying on weighted-averaging and modern analogs were developed to predict water-table depths from species relative abundance data, and these perform well under leave-one-site-out cross-validation: RMSEP = 9.75-10.3 cm, R-2 = 0.56-0.62. Including cladoceran abundance data in the calibration dataset produced modest model improvement: RMSEP = 1-8% and R-2 = 2-13%. A weighted-average partial-least-squares transfer function was applied to microfossil assemblages from a 0.5 m-long peat core with a Pb-210 decay chronology anchored by ten existing measurements of Pb-210 activity and a Bayesian statistical framework. Microfossils were well-preserved in the peat core. The water-table depth optima of an abundant down-core taxa, Hyalosphenia subflava, is not precisely constrained in the calibration data set, but estimates match those of other tropical studies. A reconstruction of water-table depth indicates dry early nineteenth-century conditions, wet conditions in the late 19th to early twentieth centuries, followed by progressive drying for much of the twentieth-century. Testate amoeba composition appears to have been sensitive to severe drought in recent decades. The results signal that assemblages of testate amoebae and Cladocera are useful proxies of Hawaiian peatland paleohydrology and should be considered alongside other archives of Hawaiian environmental history.

AB Plant macrofossil analyses of five peat cores from undisturbed fens in the flood-plain of the Ant Valley of the Norfolk Broadland show the sequence of vegetation development during the last two millennia. Macrofossil assemblages have been grouped into five regional phases and are interpreted largely in terms of the response of the vegetation to changes in sea level, climate and management. Phase I represents pre-Roman fen woodland communities (>2000 cal. BP); phase 2 represents salt-marsh communities formed during an estuarine phase in Romano-British times (c. 2000-1600 cal. BP); phase 3 represents 'tussock-fen' and can communities suggestive of drier conditions in the post-Roman to early Medieval period (c. 1600-800 cal. BP); phase 4 represents aquatic communities indicative of wetter conditions from the late Medieval period to c. 300 cal. BP; phase 5 represents communities comparable with present-day vegetation. The biostratigraphic development of the Ant Valley floodplain mires has analogues in climatically induced humification changes of some British ombrotrophic mires, suggesting a response to similar climatic controls. Widespread human interference and control of the fen vegetation may be a relatively recent phenomenon (beginning possibly <400 cai. BP). Feat-accumulation rates in the undisturbed mire sites suggest that the original Medieval turbaries which later flooded to form the Norfolk Broads may have been at least 0.5 m shallower when dug than their present depth. The wide range of environmental conditions experienced by the mires during the last two millennia is of relevance to the development of strategies for their conservation.

AB Seasonal fluctuations in the biomass, necromass, and litter decay of Carex rostrata, Eriophorum vaginatum, and Calluna vulgaris were studied in the mire complex of Cote-de-Braveix, at 1350 m of altitude in the Forez Mountains of the eastern part of the Massif central (France). The primary production of these three dominant species of the main development stages of the studied peatland were respectively 456, 353, and 531 g.m(-2).a(-1); the corresponding N fluxes were 4.5 g.m(-2).a(-1) for the first two species and 5.2 g.m(-2).a(-1) for the latter. The subterranean parts (rhizomes and roots) represented 66, 73 and 46% of the C production and 44, 47 and 37% of the N production, respectively. The biomass and N turnover rates were the highest in the E. vaginatum community (1.3 and 1.6) and the lowest in C. vulgaris (0.8 and 0.9); they were 1.1 and 1.2 in the C. rostrata community. The first year decomposition rate was equal to 0.30, 0.21 and 0.16 in the C. rostrata, E. vaginatum, and C. vulgaris litters. The production/accumulation ratio decreased from the fen to the bog species: 1.4 (C. rostrata), 1.3 (E. vaginatum), and 1.2 (C. vulgaris). The C and N balances are discussed from the viewpoint of ecological succession and peatland ecosystem development.

AB We present the paleoecological development of a rich fen located in the dune area on the SE Baltic coast, during the last 7500 years. The Apuciems Mire hosts rare and endangered plant communities in Europe, such as Schoenus ferrugineus and Cladium mariscus. Analysis at high-resolution of plant macroremains in two peat cores was carried out to reconstruct local vegetation succession and fluctuations in moisture availability on the peatland, while a pollen record was developed to reconstruct plant succession, moisture variability and human activity at the regional scale. Based on the presence or the absence of macroremains of plants that occur in wet habitat e.g. Cladium mariscus, Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, Alisma plantago-aquatica and Botrycoccocus we distinguished four wet periods ca. 6000, 2000, 1750-1550, 1200-150 cal yr. BP and four dry periods (ca. 7000, 4600-4200, 1800-1750, 1550-1200 cal yr. BP) in the peatland's development. A water level increase at 1200 cal yr. BP triggered the development of plant communities containing Chara sp., Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, then Cladium mariscus. Our study shows a link between climate change at the regional scale and vegetation development in Apuciems Mire. We showed that changes in vegetation structure during last 150 years was caused by drainage and human activity.

AB Nitrogen addition experiments were conducted in three plant communities in a post-mined peatland and on the surrounding original Sphagnum bog in northern Japan to compare the effects of nitrogenous fertilization among the plant communities. Gradients of added nitrogen were prepared by adding nitrogen to 1 m x 1 m plots at rates of 0-36 g/m(2)/yr. These different levels of nitrogen addition were applied to four sites representing a vegetation development chronosequence: bare ground (BG), a Rhynchospora alba sedgeland (RA), a Moliniopsis japonica grassland (MJ) and the original Sphagnum bog (SS). Vegetation was monitored in each plot for three years, and the groundwater level and nitrogen concentration in peat-pore water were monitored in each plot. The nitrogen concentration in peat-pore water increased with increasing nitrogen addition on BG, but was constantly low at the vegetated sites, suggesting the occurrence of nutrient uptake by plants. Species richness decreased as a result of nitrogen addition at the SS site, where plant cover was high. The aboveground biomass of the two common grasses M. japonica and Phragmites communis was not influenced by nitrogen addition in the post-mined peatland. Grasses and sedges, which produce large underground organs, showed increased biomass as a result of nitrogen addition in the SS plot whereas Sphagnum declined. Additionally, forbs declined in the SS plot with increasing nitrogen, most likely due to competition with the increased populations of grasses. Therefore, nitrogen enrichment can promote the dominance grasses, leading to a decrease in mosses and forbs.

AB The vegetation of a subalpine fen in Colorado was studied. Insight was sought into the community structure and factors influencing species distribution of a vegetation type heretofore undescribed in the southern Rocky Mountains. A vegetational gradient was evaluated using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). Four types of vegetation were subjectively defined; these same types were distinguished by the DCA. DCA further revealed marked differences in the vegetation occurring on peat hummocks versus in hollows. Species composition was related to environment using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Water-table depth, hummock height, shading, groundwater temperature, and conductivity were significantly correlated with species distribution, accounting for 51% of the total species variance. Univariate regression was used to examine how tree density varied with environment. The above factors, except for shading and conductivity, were also significantly correlated with tree density. It is suggested that the peat hummocks that form on this moderate fen provide an environment similar to that of an ombrotrophic bog and that these ''miniature bogs'' form in areas unable to support expansive bogs. Further, these hummocks provide small-scale environmental heterogeneity that exerts a strong control over species composition that would not be evident in studies based on samples of a large areal extent.

AB Peat, as a heterogeneous mixture of decaying plant debris and microbial residues, has been widely used in many fields. However, little research focused on the impact of peat addition on food waste composting. To fill this gap, a composting experiment of food waste mixed with five varying percent peat 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20% (w/w, dry weight) was designed to investigate the effect of different dosages of peat on nitrogen conservation, physiochemical parameters, and fungal community dynamics during composting. The results showed that adding peat elevated the peak temperature of composting, lowered final pH, reduced ammonia emissions and increased the final total nitrogen content. Compared to control, adding 5, 10, 15, and 20% peat decreased ammonia emissions by 1.91, 10.79, 23.73, and 18.26%, respectively, during 42 days of composting. Moreover, peat addition increased fungal community diversity especially during maturation phase. The most two abundant phyla were Basidiomycota and Ascomycota in all treatments throughout the composting process. At the end of composting, in treatments with adding 10 and 15% peat, the richest fungi were Scedosporium spp. and Coprinopsis spp., respectively. Simultaneously, canonical correlation analyses showed that pH, moisture content, and seed germination index had significant association with fungal community composition. The study also showed that fungal community and nitrogen conservation had no direct obvious relation during composting. Overall, the results suggest that the addition of peat could efficiently enhance nitrogen conservation through reduction of ammonia emissions and 15% peat addition is the optimal formula for food waste composting.

AB Aims
   Our objective was to investigate how the after-effects of a heatwave interacted with nutrient addition in affecting the vegetation of an alpine mire. We also aimed to assess if the responses of vegetation to the environmental changes differed between mire habitats.
   Location
   A mire in the Dolomites (southeastern Alps, Italy, 1800m a.s.l.).
   Methods
   We carried out an 8-yr (2002-2009) experiment of nutrient addition in an alpine mire that experienced, in summer 2003, an unprecedented heatwave. The cover of vascular plants and mosses was assessed non-destructively and the presence of all vascular plant and moss species was recorded in 60 plots.
   Results
   Interacting effects of the heatwave and experimental fertilization brought about profound changes in the vegetation of the mire. Patterns of change varied considerably between two habitats (hummocks and lawns). In the short term (2003-2005), the 2003 heatwave triggered a change in vegetation structure and PFT cover, with vascular plants expanding at the expense of mosses in both habitats. In the mid-term (2005-2009), moss cover increased in hummocks because Sphagnum mosses recovered and non-Sphagnum mosses expanded, especially under N addition. Conversely, in lawns vascular plants expanded while mosses did not recover. These trends were strengthened when N was added with no concomitant P addition. A decline in species richness was observed in lawns, most likely due to stronger interactions among species.
   Conclusions
   Hummocks have a greater ability than lawns to recover from extreme climatic events under higher levels of N influx. Conversely, a persistent increase in vascular plant cover at the expense of moss cover in lawns may jeopardize the carbon sink function of lawn habitats.

AB Peatlands, while ecologically interesting and abundant in the northeast, have gone largely unstudied in New Hampshire. This baseline study focuses on a vegetation analysis of the vascular flora of Pequawket Bog, Ossipee, New Hampshire. A total flora of 109 species, including Eriophorum angustifolium, an endangered plant species for the state of New Hampshire, was documented for the bog. Using stratified random sampling, 287 plots from 10 transects were sampled for percent cover of vascular plant species. Five vegetation cover types and nine subtypes were determined using the computer classification program TWINSPAN. The five cover types include: a Nymphaea odorata cover type, a Carex lasiocarpa cover type, a Chamaedaphne calyculata-Woodwardia virginica cover type, a Chamaedaphne calyculata-Vaccinium oxycoccos-Eriophor um virginicum cover type, and an Acer rubrum-Vaccinium corymbosum-Lyonia ligustrina cover type.

AB The relationship between vegetation gradients and temporal variation of groundwater table depth, groundwater pH and electrical conductivity was studied in Bekanbeushi peatland, northern Japan. These environmental factors were expressed using four statistical parameters: maximum, minimum, mean and standard deviation or coefficient of variation during the growing season. The bog-fen-swamp/marsh gradient was primarily explained by minimum, maximum and mean groundwater table depth and minimum pH. The separation between the bog and the fen by minimum pH was particularly clear. Minimum conductivity was secondarily important for explaining this vegetation gradient. The swamp-marsh gradient was explained by the standard deviation of groundwater table depth. Maximum pH and conductivity were not significant in explaining either of these gradients. This study suggests that parameters that are obtained from the consecutive measurement of environmental factors may have differing significance in explaining vegetation gradients in these peatlands, and values from a single sampling may miss important ecological information.

AB Seventeen peatland complexes were investigated in a 2000-ha study area in the Barnes Lake region of the west-central Wind River Range in Wyoming, U.S.A. Sites ranged in elevation from 2970 to 3200 m. The peatlands are generally less than 2 ha in size and are supported by groundwater flow systems. Seventeen plant community types are recognized using two-way indicator species analysis and Braun-Blanquet table methods, including 4 aquatic communities, 6 peatland expanse communities, and 7 peatland margin communities. Surface water in the study area is neutral to slightly acidic with very low cation concentrations. The water pH and flora indicate rich fen conditions, while the cation concentrations are more comparable to poor fens or even bogs. We propose calling the study area peatlands transitional rich fens, which are fed by mineral-poor water. The chemical composition of surface waters was found to be similar among different communities. Patterns of plant species and plant community distribution are a function of the water table depth and duration gradient and flow rates of the water supply. The rich-poor and peatland expanse - peatland margin gradients that reflect nutrient gradients do not appear to be important in the study area.

AB A survey of the existing studies on peat and its decomposition processes is presented with the aim to characterise the long-term behaviour of peat accumulating systems. The chemical and physical characteristics of peat together with its accumulation and decay processes have been analysed.
   Peat is an acidic mixture of dead and decomposed. mainly vegetable, matter formed in boggy areas; it is the youngest and least altered component of the combustible rocks and is characterised by the lowest content of fixed carbon and the highest content of volatile constituents. Peat is formed by degeneration processes under exclusion of atmospheric oxygen by the action of water; the speed of formation depends upon the climatic and environmental conditions.
   In most peatlands two layers can be characterised: the aerobic acrotelm and the anaerobic catotelm, their relative importance being controlled mainly by the position of the water table. In the acrotelm the aerobic processes are responsible for the loss of up to 90% of the original mass, Degeneration in the acidic and anaerobic catotelm is still imperfectly characterised even though the catotelm is the real site of peat accumulation.
   Most of the recent literature considers peat as composed of easily degradable compounds, e.g. polysaccharides. and recalcitrant matter (lignin and complex aromatics). The lone-term destiny of peat has not been sufficiently characterised: although in a large majority of cases it seems probable that peat decomposes completely (even though slowly) provided that it is given a sufficiently long residence rime in the catotelm, some cases can still be interpreted as examples of simple accumulation.
   The rates of influx of oxygen and hence the degradation of organic matter into both saturated and partially saturated peat have been estimated. The depletion rate is about 4500 g m(-1) year(-1) for partially saturated peat. The average depletion rate of the peat for this case will then be such that it will take on the order of 5 to 50 years to degrade half of the organics in a 10 cm partially saturated layer. For the water-saturated case the depletion rate varies between 8 and 12 g m(-2) year(-1), which is considerably lower than in the partially saturated region. The models used to analyse the field and laboratory data on generation, diffusion and emission of methane and carbon dioxide indicate that laboratory data and field observations agree reasonably well.
   It is suggested that peat-accumulating ecosystems may be valuable natural analogues for the study of the long-term destiny of industrial and municipal solid wastes. Accurate studies of active mires together with an ad hoc review of the existing literature give valuable insights in this problem. Peatlands might then be considered as organic waste deposition experiments lasting up to several thousands years. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Palaeobotanical and palynological data were analysed from the Mississippian localities of the north-western part of Russia. The distribution of various fossil plants in the studied area has been traced. The palynological assemblages were described and palaeoecologically analysed. Arborescent lycopsids played the main role in the palaecommunities. Arthrophytes did not significantly influence the composition of the assemblages under study. Pteridosperms dominated only in repopulate disturbed areas. It has been demonstrated that the forest mire vegetation type dominated during all studied time intervals while the non-forest mire gradually diminished. Palaeoecological interpretation of palynological data is generally supported by palaeobotanical data.

AB We analysed and interpreted ecologically a part of classic peatland vegetation material of prof. Rauno Ruuhijarvi dating from 1960. Sample plots formed a compositional gradient along NMDS 1 across three traditionally recognized peatland subzones of Finnish Lapland, and Cajanderian site types showed a poor-rich gradient along NMDS 2. Analysis-based major vegetation groups were related to the regional and the mire-expanse-to-margin gradient. Southerly-focused Eriophorum gracile-Potentilla palustris-Straminergon stramineum major group was interpreted as an indication of a more voluminous spring flood in a more oceanic climate, while northerly-focused Carex rotundata-Trichophorum cespitosum m. g. was interpreted as a reflection of a minor spring flood in a more continental climate. Regional communities were compatible with Cajanderian site types and showed new regional and vegetation-ecological features for site types. They were related to three European fen alliances, which represented boreal (Stygio-Caricion limosae), arcto-boreal-alpine (Drepanocladion exannulati) and widespread (Scheuchzerion palustris) vegetation. Introduction Mires in treeless fjelds belong to the least studied peatland types in Finland. Such sites are scattered and very small in area; they are more numerous in Sweden and Norway, which host the mountain range of the Scandes (Moen 1999, Rydin et al. 1999).

AB The response of peatlands to changes in the climatic water budget is crucial to predicting potential feedbacks on the global carbon (C) cycle. To gain insight on the patterns and mechanisms of response, we linked a model of peat accumulation to a model of peatland hydrology, then applied these models to empirical data spanning the past 5000 years for the large mire Store Mosse in southern Sweden. We estimated parameters for C sequestration and height growth by fitting the peat accumulation model to two age profiles. Then, we used independent reconstruction of climate wetness and model reconstruction of bog height to examine changes in peatland hydrology. Reconstructions of C sequestration showed two distinct patterns of behaviour: abrupt increases associated with major transitions in vegetation and dominant Sphagnum species (fuscum, rubellum-fuscum and magellanicum stages), and gradual decreases associated with increasing humification of newly formed peat. Carbon sequestration rate ranged from a minimum of 14 to a maximum of 72 g m(-2) yr(-1), with the most rapid changes occurring in the past 1000 years. Vegetation transitions were associated with periods of increasing climate wetness during which the hydrological requirement for increased seepage loss was met by rise of the water table closer to the peatland surface, with the indirect result of enhancing peat formation. Gradual decline in C sequestration within each vegetation stage resulted from enhanced litter decay losses from the near-surface layer. In the first two vegetation stages, peatland development (i.e., increasing surface gradient) and decreasing climate wetness drove a gradual increase in thickness of the unsaturated, near-surface layer, reducing seepage water loss and peat formation. In the most recent vegetation stage, the surface diverged into a mosaic of wet and dry microsites. Despite a steady increase in climate wetness, C sequestration declined rapidly. The complexity of response to climate change cautions against use of past rates to estimate current or to predict future rates of peatland C sequestration. Understanding interactions among hydrology, surface structure and peat formation are essential to predicting potential feedback on the global C cycle.

AB In this study, we estimated the relative importance of vegetation and fungi for radiocesium uptake and biological retention in adjacent bog, pine swamp, and forest. The measurements for Cs-137 activity concentration in sporocarps (i.e. fruitbodies of fungi) and vegetation along a bog to forest transect were combined with complementary published data to calculate estimates. Aboveground vegetation comprised 17.7% of the total fallout-derived radiocesium in the system in bog, 16.5% in pine swamp, and 40.6% in forest. In fungal sporocarps grown along a gradient, Cs-137 activity comprised <0.001% of the total radiocesium for peat bog, <0.02% for pine swamp, and 0.11% for forest. Total Cs-137 activity in sporocarps increased along the gradient due to increased production of sporocarps in the presence of trees from 0.006 (bog), 0.097 (pine swamp) and 0.67 (forest) g dwt m(-2). Based on calculation of the total vegetation biomass and through relationships between fungal biomass in sporocarps and as mycelia in soil, the total Cs-137 activity located in fungi was estimated as 0.1% in bog, 2% in pine swamp, and 11% in forest. An analysis of the time-dependency of Cs-137 in the sporocarps in forest between 1990 and 2011 suggested an ecological half-life for Cs-137 between 8 and 13 years. Although fungi comprised a relatively small fraction of the total radiocesium in the systems, its activity decreased slowly with time, and ecological residence time for Cs-137 in sporocarps of fungi was long, suggesting they will continue to contribute to the accumulation and cycling of this radionuclide in forest.

AB In recent decades, a severe wildfire situation threatening the territory along the periphery of the Bastak State Nature Reserve (Russia) has developed in the Petrovskaya Pad'. In this paper, we assessed the current state of the vegetation cover and post-pyrogenic changes in the Petrovskaya Pad', based on the geobotanical survey during a joint expedition in 2009. At present, this area of the Middle Amur Lowland is a vivid example of wetland degradation due to the repeated wildfire impact initiated by the local people and agricultural workers in the Amur region. The widespread xerophytisation process of fen vegetation, due to a sharp drop in the groundwater level, was observed. A comparison with the data of previous studies led to the conclusions that now mesotrophic shrub-Sphagnum bogs, described earlier, have completely disappeared from the vegetation cover of the territory. We suggest that their degradation is caused by the continuously acting pyrogenic factor. In addition, the paper for the first time provides data on the dynamics of the acrotelm structure in the post-pyrogenic period, which were obtained during a nine-year monitoring. The profound changes in the acrotelm structure are responsible for the restoration of mesotrophic bogs taking decades.

AB There has been increasing interest in potential benefits to be gained by restoring damaged peatlands, with the majority of funding currently being driven by the recovery of protected habitats. However, few data are available linking vegetation community declines with peatland drainage, and so the potential for recovery remains difficult to predict. Surprisingly, there is a similar paucity of research demonstrating the extent of drainage impacts on grazing conditions for livestock, despite this being a priority amongst land managers. We attempt to address these two knowledge gaps, first by investigating whether ditches in blanket bog habitat have improved or increased grazing for sheep, and second by assessing the impact of ditches on the condition of vegetation communities. At an extensively drained upland blanket bog in Wales, currently undergoing ditch blocking restoration, we collected vegetation and sheep occurrence data across five catchments and over 2 years. We present evidence that drained areas had remained relatively wet and were less preferred by sheep. Furthermore, our results show that while sheep preferred graminoid-rich areas, drainage did not increase the abundance of this species group. Drainage at the site has, however, resulted in some degradation in blanket bog vegetation adjacent to ditches; although at the landscape scale, historic high grazing levels appear to explain much of the current poor ecological condition of the site. We conclude that drain-blocking restoration should not reduce sheep grazing conditions beyond their current relatively poor state, and thus in this respect may not represent a threat to hill farming productivity.

AB Here we investigate the vegetation history and peat accumulation at the eastern boarder of the West Siberian Plain, near the Yenisey River, south of permafrost. In this region, peat started to accumulate 15 000 years ago as gyttja of shallow lakes in ancient river valleys. This peat is older than previously reported, mainly due to separating particulate organic carbon (POC) from dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which was 1900-6500 years younger than POC. The probability of finding peat layers older than 12 000 years is about 2 %. Peat accumulated as fen peat at a constant rate of 0.2 mm yr(-1) and 0.01 kg C m(-2) yr(-1). The accumulation was higher in ancient river valley environments. Over the last 2000 years these bogs changed into Sphagnum mires which have accumulated up to about 0.1 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) until present.
   The long-lasting fen stage, which makes the Yenisey bogs distinct from the western Siberian bogs, is discussed as a consequence of the local hydrology. The high accumulation rate of peat in unfrozen mires is taken as an indication that thawing of permafrost peat may also change northern peatlands into long-lasting carbon sinks.

AB In order to clearly understand the response of raised mires to past climate change, it is important to consider the full range of drivers and responses of these ecohydrological archives. To this end, a high-resolution ecohydrological record from Littleton Bog, Co. Tipperary, Ireland, was generated utilizing a combination of plant macrofossils, testate amoebae and humification analysis. Chronological control for this record was provided by a Bayesian age-depth model based on AMS radiocarbon dates. Testate amoebae-derived reconstructed peatland water tables indicate a series of sudden shifts to dry bog surface conditions at c. 3140, c. 2510 and c. 1540 cal. BP. These events display a distinctive palaeoecological signal and chronological tempo that is best explained as a result of a series of bog burst events and which seem inconsistent with other explanations. The chronological correspondence between the bog bursts at Littleton and a set of similar events at Derryville Bog, c. 5 km to the north, is noted, as is the broad correspondence of these events with wet shifts indicated in regional peatland water table compilations from Britain and Ireland. A range of possible driving mechanisms for these events is proposed, including anthropogenic disturbance of the bog surface, non-linear response to climate forcing, internal bog dynamics, vegetation succession or a combination of factors. We illustrate the need for further multi-proxy investigations to fully understand these phenomena.

AB Sphagnum-bog ecosystems have a limited capability to retain carbon and nutrients when subjected to increased nitrogen (N) deposition. Although it has been proposed that phosphorus (P) can dilute negative effects of nitrogen by increasing biomass production of Sphagnum mosses, it is still unclear whether P-addition can alleviate physiological N-stress in Sphagnum plants. A 3-year fertilisation experiment was conducted in lawns of a pristine Sphagnum magellanicum bog in Patagonia, where competing vascular plants were practically absent. Background wet deposition of nitrogen was low (similar to 0.10.2 g.N.m-2.year-1). Nitrogen (4 g.N.m-2.year-1) and phosphorus (1 g.P.m-2.year-1) were applied, separately and in combination, six times during the growing season. P-addition substantially increased biomass production of Sphagnum. Nitrogen and phosphorus changed the morphology of Sphagnum mosses by enhancing height increment, but lowering moss stem density. In contrast to expectations, phosphorus failed to alleviate physiological stress imposed by excess nitrogen (e.g. amino acid accumulation, N-saturation and decline in photosynthetic rates). We conclude that despite improving growth conditions by P-addition, Sphagnum-bog ecosystems remain highly susceptible to nitrogen additions. Increased susceptibility to desiccation by nutrients may even worsen the negative effects of excess nitrogen especially in windy climates like in Patagonia.

AB Piezometric head data from various depths were examined at two peatlands in Ontario, Canada and one peatland in Sweden influenced by small-scale, shallow groundwater systems. Data from different hydrogeological settings show reversals in groundwater flow leading to discharge in topographically high regions of peatlands in isolation from large-scale groundwater flow. It is suggested that subsurface flow within peat can reverse in direction in response to water deficit and water-table drawdown. The data presented here refute the assumption that local groundwater flow in peatlands is unidirectional and further illustrate the fact that measurable subsurface water flow can occur at depth in peat isolated from large-scale groundwater flow systems. In the light of implicit assumptions made by many workers on water movement in peatlands, especially when connected to small-scale groundwater systems, the consequences of such reversals are paramount in understanding the hydrology and biogeochemistry of peatlands.

AB Increases in pool water and peat temperature in summer accelerate peat decomposition and production of biogenic gases, which can be trapped in peat pores and cause oscillation of peatland surfaces and the rise of peat from the bottom of bog pools. Associated changes in peat water conductivity, holding capacity and transpiration also affect bog hydrology. Our multi-year study is the first to show in detail the extent and dynamics of changes in bog pool depth and bottom topography associated with changes in temperature, peat type and other factors. The true seasonal rise of peat from the pool bottom begins once the water temperature at the pool bottom exceeds 13-14 degrees C, although the speed and extent of the rise depends on peat properties, making the rise more erratic than its subsequent descent. The more rapid descent occurs after the first large drop in the temperature of the pool's surface water at the end of summer, resulting from the combination of reduced methane production and increased gas solubility with less influence by peat properties. Much higher dissolved organic carbon concentrations (216 +/- 26mgl(-1)) in the pore water of peat risen from the bottom to the pool surface compared with that in the same type of peat at the pool bottom (62 +/- 20mgl(-1)) indicate an acceleration of peat decomposition at the warmer pool surface. We show the extent and character of changes in pool depth and bottom topography and how annual differences relate to temperature. Only a few degrees' increase in pool water temperature could induce the pool bottom to rise faster and more extensively for a longer period and enhance decomposition in the peat at the pool surface. This should be evaluated in greater detail to assess the effects of temperature increase on the carbon budget and hydrology of peatlands. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Vegetation and water table are important regulators of methane emission in peatlands. Microform variation encompasses these factors in small-scale topographic gradients of dry hummocks, intermediate lawns and wet hollows. We examined methane production and oxidization among microforms in four boreal bogs that showed more variation of vegetation within a bog with microform than between the bogs. Potential methane production was low and differed among bogs but not consistently with microform. Methane oxidation followed water table position with microform, showing higher rates closer to surface in lawns and hollows than in hummocks. Methanogen community, analysed by mcrA terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and dominated by Methanoregulaceae or 'Methanoflorentaceae', varied strongly with bog. The extent of microform-related variation of methanogens depended on the bog. Methanotrophs identified as Methylocystis spp. in pmoA denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis similarly showed effect of bog, and microform patterns were stronger within individual bogs. Our results suggest that methane-cycling microbes in boreal Sphagnum bogs with seemingly uniform environmental conditions may show strong site-dependent variation. The bog-intrinsic factor may be related to carbon availability but contrary to expectations appears to be unrelated to current surface vegetation, calling attention to the origin of carbon substrates for microbes in bogs.

AB 1. Chemical analyses are presented of major ions (H+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, Cl-, SO42-) in water samples from 39 ombrogenous bog sites and 10 basin and valley mires in Britain and Ireland.
   2. The first axis in principal component analyses of the data is most strongly correlated with Na+, Mg2+ and Cl-, reflecting total ionic concentration dominated by sea-spray components; subsequent axes correlate particularly with Ca2+, H+ and SO42- and largely reflect terrestrial and pollution inputs.
   3. The quotient of total to marine-derived Ca2+ shows a broad regional trend from values below 2 on the Atlantic coast of Ireland to 5 or more inland in Britain, with considerable local variation. Locally very high values may relate to, for example, nearby agriculture (liming) or quarrying.
   4. Measured concentrations of K+ in ombrogenous sites range from 0.25 to 4.04 times the expected value from marine input; they vary sporadically with little sign of regional trends. Some of the variation reflects uptake and release by vegetation, but some must be due to local inputs of terrestrial origin.
   5. The proportion of SO42- to Cl- on the Atlantic coasts of Ireland and Scotland is near that in seawater (0.103). Higher average SO42- concentrations farther east are broadly in line with expectation from published atmospheric SO42- deposition data. Concentrations of hydrogen ions and some heavy metals show comparable trends.
   6. The average proportions of most major ions in ombrogenous mire waters are similar to those in rainfall in the same areas. Ionic concentrations in ombrogenous bog waters are higher than the mean values in rainwater by a factor of 1.25-2.50 or more. There is evidence that some ombrogenous bog surfaces receive substantial dry deposition of Ca.
   7. Basin and valley mires are not sharply delimited from ombrogenous mires in their water chemistry, but they commonly show (i) rather higher concentration ratios of ions relative to rainwater, and (ii) proportions of ions differing markedly from those expected from precipitation inputs.
   8. The data show broad correlations between variation in ombrogenous bog vegetation, species limits, and the major-ion composition of the mire waters. These probably arise at least in part from parallel responses to topographical and climatic factors. Many ombrogenous bog species and vegetation types show wide amplitude in relation to major ions within the field of variation examined here: the factors limiting the more restricted species require more critical study.

The pollen and macrofossil analysis and the C-14 data were used for the spatio-temporal reconstruction of the development of the mire, including its vegetation and microclimatic conditions during the Holocene. The comparative analysis of the data gained allows us to estimate the relative influence of various local, extra-local, and regional natural processes on the dynamics of the ecosystems.

DE lepidoptera; larvae; submergence; peatland restoration
AB The rehabilitation of raised mires commonly requires water levels to be raised in order to reinstate Sphagnum-based raised mire vegetation over peatland areas which have previously been extensively, worked by commercial pear cutters. Coenonympha tullia larvae living on cotton-sedge tussocks Eriophorum vaginatum in the base of peat cuttings will be inundated by the rising water levels under such management regimes. The submergence of overwintering C. tullia larvae was found to have a marked impact on their long term survival. The numbers of larvae that survived to resume feeding the following spring was lower for all submergence times (3 to 108 days) compared with controls; no larvae survived a submergence period of 108 days. Total submergence had two effects. First, it caused an immediate increase in mortality after 7 days (with larval death occurring under water) and second, a longer term increase in mortality over the next few months. Behavioural tests suggested that C. tullia larvae usually respond to the raising of water levels by trying to climb out of the water. Results suggest that, on sites where the conservation of C. tullia is important, water levels should nor be raised so high as to totally submerge E. vaginatum foodplants containing C. tullia larvae until E. vaginatum has spread sufficiently on the higher peat surface to provide a replacement habitat.

AB Reclamation of sites affected by oil sands mining in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) targets the construction of new fen watersheds, which are dominant wetland types in the region. The aquifers of slopes that supply water to the fen watershed are formed with tailings sands containing residual oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) contaminants, whose effects on peat microbial community function are poorly explored. To understand the effect of potential OSPW contamination on microbial communities typical to the range of peatlands in the AOSR, we measured microbial functional characteristics (overall substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and catabolic evenness) and tested the effect of short-term in-vitro exposure to OSPW in peat samples from three representative fen types (treed rich fen, poor fen, and hypersaline fen) within the AOSR at the start (early May) and middle (late June) of the growing season. Overall, our results suggest that short-term exposure to OSPW has negligible impact on peat aerobic microbial activity, and that time of growing season and site physicochemical characteristics are the primary control on microbial potential activity. Further studies are necessary to assess the effects of OSPW contaminants on microbial-driven processes in the medium and long terms, under anaerobic conditions, which dominate in peatlands.

AB Crystal Fen in north-central Maine has become well-known as a locality with numerous rare plants.  Recent observations of apparent drying and an increase in abundance of woody vegetation in the fen have led to concerns that an adjacent railroad bed and drainage ditch may be causing changes that threaten the habitat of several rare and interesting plant taxa.  A description of these changes comes from analysis of (1) aerial photographs dating from 1938 to the present; (2) characteristics of the present vegetation, including the age of living woody plants; (3) evidence of fire on the fen; and (4) the fossil-pollen and charcoal stratigraphy for the past 200 years from an area of the fen that is becoming increasingly wooded.
   Results indicate that during much of its history the fen may have been at least partially wooded, except in the area that is wettest and most open today.  Construction of the railbed in 1893, and the passing of cinder-producing steam locomotives along the tracks thereafter, apparently promoted expansion of fen vegetation by impeding drainage and by igniting occasional fires that reduced the abundance of woody stems.  Thus, the extensive open habitat where populations of some rare plants occur is, in fact, an artificial result of human activities.  Recent drier conditions post-date the construction of a drainage ditch in 1937 and the introduction of diesel-powered locomotives around 1950, which largely eliminated the ignition of fires and allowed the re-expansion of woody taxa over most of the fen.  This trend represents a partial retreat to natural conditions.
   The study demonstrates that (1) rare plants occur in a variety of habitats (open, lightly forested, and heavily forested) at Crystal Fen, suggesting that these populations would be best served by maintaining such habitat diversity; and (2) past human disturbance led to expansion of open areas, which is the habitat most suitable for some of the rare taxa.  In the future, both open fen areas and overall habitat diversity could be artificially enhanced using a variety of management practices including cutting, prescribed burning, and manipulating drainage to maintain a mixture of vegetation types.

AB We determined concentrations of major nutrients in the vegetation of six habitat types (hummock, scrub, lawn, fen meadow, hollow and marginal stream), spanning a broad range of environmental conditions as regards water-table depth and water chemistry, in five mires on the southern Alps of Italy. Our study was based on chemical analyses of living tissues of plant species, grouped into growth-form based plant functional types (PFTs). We aimed at assessing to what extent the observed differences in tissue nutrient content were accounted for by community composition (both in terms of species and PFTs) and by habitat. Nutrient concentrations were overall lowest in Sphagnum mosses and highest in forbs, although the latter showed large variations presumably due to heterogeneity in mechanisms and adaptations for acquiring nutrients among species within this PFT. Nutrient content patterns in the other three PFTs varied greatly in relation to individual nutrients, with evergreen shrubs showing low nitrogen (N) concentrations, graminoids showing high N concentrations but low potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg) concentrations and deciduous shrubs showing rather high phosphorus (P) concentrations. Habitat accounted for a modest fraction of variation in tissue concentration of all nutrients except P. We concluded that the nutrient status of mire vegetation is primarily controlled by community composition and structure although habitat does exert a direct control on P concentration in the vegetation, presumably through P availability for plant uptake.

AB Peatlands have traditionally been exploited in forestry and agriculture over the boreal region, yet they also provide substantial source of fuel production. The large-scale exploitation of peatlands has raised a concern about the diversity of mire plant communities. We studied composition of mire plant communities along soil nutrient potential and water content gradients, to recognize the areas with the high plant diversity. Soil electrical conductivity (EC(b)) was measured to characterise soil nutrient regimes and soil dielectric permittivity (DP) the soil (volumetric) water regimes. A total of 115 mire sites were studied in the central boreal region of south-western Finnish Lapland. We found that Ward's hierarchical cluster analysis produced eight stable EC(b) and DP clusters with discrete vegetation compositions. On the basis of a locally weighted regression analysis (Loess), Carex dioica L., Comarum palustre L., Equisetum fluviatile L., Menyanthes trifoliata L., and Scorpidium scorpioides (Hedw.) Limpr. were found as indicator species for nutrient-rich regimes as designated by high soil EC(b). The soil EC(b) is a diagnostic measure of plant diversity as EC(b) > 7 mSm(-1) resulted in a considerable increase in species richness. Our classification method, based on electrical measurements, provides a simple way to classify mires and focus detailed research to areas with potentially high conservation value.

The catotelm portions of bog, permafrost-affected peat plateau, and Sphagnum-dominated cores were interpreted to conform to Clymo's (1984) model of C accumulation, while peat deposited under conditions with high water tables (rich fen and collapse fen) did not. The model assumes a consistent surface production, yet production in fens is thought to be highly sensitive to water table changes and may have contributed to poor model fits. Decay rates. measured over the past 1200 yr range from 0.0015 to 0.0004 yr(-1). True C accumulation rates (range 7.0 in peat plateau to 18.6 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in bog) and sequestration efficiencies (range 0.24 in peat plateau to 0.67 in poor fen) by 1200 yr BP were low in comparison with other North American sites. Decay rates measured over 1200 yr were significantly greater than that measured over the entire life span of the peatland (0.00033 yr(-1)), suggesting that a catotelm true C accumulation model incorporating a decreasing rate of decay would be more applicable.

AB Background: Northern peatlands are known for having significant stocks of terrestrial soil carbon (C). However, little is known about how peatlands function under various land uses and what impacts land-use change has on their functioning in central Europe.
   Aim: The objective of our study was to quantify the variability and controls of typical plant communities in terms of C gas dynamics on bogs and fens affected by a changed hydrological regime in the Bohemian Forest, Czech Republic.
   Methods: Carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange and methane emissions (CH4) were measured in bogs (pristine, drained, restored) and in fens (pristine, drained) during the 2009 growing season. We applied cluster analysis to define plant communities and non-linear response models to quantify the variation in CO2 dynamics among the communities.
   Results: Drainage had a strong impact on vegetation; forest and meadows species were dominant on drained peatland sites and the vascular green area was higher than on pristine sites. The net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) varied from -27 to 241 g CO2-C m(-2) per growing season on the bogs and from 27 to 153 g m(-2) on the fens. The most-drained parts of the bog and fen with the most changed vegetation structure acted as both net C sources and very weak C sinks; however, areas dominated by Molinia caerulea acted as a strong C sink. Plant communities on the wetter parts of drained sites had a positive seasonal NEE, comparable with NEE on pristine sites. Seasonal CH4 emissions were relatively low (0-9 g CH4-C m(-2)) at all sites and did not influence net C balance, with the exception of pristine fen where CH4 emissions with average 90 g C m(-2) led to a negative total growing season C balance. Water regime restoration caused neither a significant change in plant composition nor any major changes, such as plant die-back or increased CH4 emissions during the first season after restoration.
   Conclusions: Our results showed that C gas fluxes, and in turn the C balance of the whole ecosystem, were largely determined by plant community type. Drainage did not necessarily lead to a negative ecosystem C balance; however, a significant change of species composition occurred on most drained areas. The less-drained parts on drained sites, where original peatland species and original functions are preserved, could facilitate future ecosystem restoration.

AB In the western part of the Carpathian flysch zone, aquifers host several springwater chemistry types. Four vegetation types, distinguished along the poor-rich gradient (tufa-forming and peat forming brown moss fens, moderately rich and poor Sphagnum fens), have been compared with respect to the main habitat factors. Water calcium and magnesium concentrations, pH and conductivity as well as the soil organic carbon content were the properties measured that showed the strongest correlation with the main vegetation gradient (the poor-rich gradient). Further, significant differences in iron, sodium, potassium, sulphate and phosphate concentrations were also found between pairs of related vegetation types. The range of calcium concentrations is wide (2-300 mg/l). The calcium concentration in tufa-forming springs is higher than values usually reported from northern and western Europe. Tufa formation is influenced not only by high calcium concentrations, but also by the total chemical composition of springwater and both climatic and topographic conditions. There is a great excess of cations over Cl- and SO42-, balanced by HCO3- and CO32- in springs with the most intense tufa precipitation, Unusually high calcium concentrations combined with high iron concentrations were found in peat-forming brown moss fens. Rich Sphagnum-fens with calcitolerant Sphagnum species are distinctively low in phosphates, The Western Carpathian poor fens dominated by Sphagnum flexuosum have water and soil calcium concentrations comparable to those reported from rich fens of some other areas. The springwater of these fens are rich in iron, phosphates and sulphates, The poorest spring fens with Sphagnum fallax, S. magellanicum, S, papillosum and S. auriculatum are not only poor in calcium, but also in iron, sodium and potassium.

AB Plant litter provides a fresh source of energy and nutrients to fuel microbial activity in soil, and in northern peatlands this can be leaf litter from mosses, graminoids, shrubs, and/or trees. Because Sphagnum and other mosses decompose slowly, vascular plant litter assumes a principal role, but its role in microbial methane production is unclear. Therefore, we examined decomposition of leaf litter from nine species, including trees, shrubs, and graminoids, using litterbags positioned for up to 2.5 years in two raised bogs and in two rich fens. Across species leaf litter quality varied for concentrations of nitrogen, soluble organic matter, and cell wall composition. After 2.5 years of decay the amount of leaf litter mass remaining ranged from 43 to 63% in the bogs vs. 17 to 71% in the rich fens. Thus, site conditions interacted with litter quality to determine decay rates but with species-specific patterns. Leaf mass remaining after 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 years of decay was incubated in vitro, without soil, to assess its ability to support methane production and concomitant anaerobic carbon dioxide respiration. Residue from all nine species supported methane production, with the greatest rates (up to 5,000 nmol g(-1) day(-1)) in tissue with high concentrations of pectin. Rates were 2- to 700-times greater for the leaf material that decomposed in the rich fens than in the bogs. Production rates were more variable for methane than for anaerobic respiration. As seen for mass loss, differences in litter quality predicted variation in gas production rates but differently in the bogs than in the rich fens. The results underscore the importance of vascular plant litter in the biogeochemistry of carbon and methane in peatlands and why vegetation, plant species composition, and peatland type must be described to put peatland ecosystems into global budgets of carbon and methane.

AB Peat bogs play an important role in the functioning of the biogeochemical cycles of the chemical elements that are connected to climatological and environmental changes, at least at the regional level. For several decades, this has made the issue of wetland evolution of particular interest among the scientific community worldwide. A number of authors have studied different aspects of wetland geochemistry and evolution: the chemical composition of bog water and peat, including nutrient dynamics, bog vegetation, hydrological characteristics, and the mineralogical composition of peat. However, some issues remained insufficiently studied, including the distribution of chemical elements in peat deposits and, particularly, the causes of the formation of some minerals in the peat deposits. To research these issues, we estimated the geochemical conditions of the formation of some minerals in the oligotrophic pine-shrub-sphagnum bog and adjacent area (part of the Vasyugan Swamp, Western Siberia) in the winter period of 2017 and 2018. It was revealed that there were no less than two complex geochemical barriers in the peat deposit. These barriers correspond to changes in advective and diffusion flows and result in the accumulation of Fe and some other chemical elements in the peat deposit. The upper complex geochemical barrier of redox, sulfide, and sorption type is located approximately at a depth of 0.40-1.25 m. The bottom barrier, which is the combination of complex geochemical barrier of alkaline and sorption type with mechanical barrier, are located at the bottom layer of the peat deposit, at a depth of 2.25-2.50 m. Accumulation of substances in the upper geochemical barrier is always less significant than in the bottom barrier. Therefore, the probability of detecting high concentrations of various substances is very high in the bottom part of the peat deposit, the organomineral sediments, and the upper part of the underlying mineral ground.

AB The development and distribution of Northern mires, including minerotrophic fens and ombrotrophic raised bogs, frequently are presumed to be strongly controlled by the interplay of regional climate and site geomorphology and history. Investigations of these relationships provide insights into long-term trends in ecosystem development by linking geological and landscape-scale processes. In this study, a theoretical model for raised-bog development integrates internal bog hydrodynamics with external factors, including local substrate characteristics, and regional temperature and moisture conditions. The model is used to interpret the development of raised bogs in the Bergslagen region, which coincides with the modern northern distributional limit of those mires in central Sweden. The development of minerotrophic fens that precede bog formation is also considered. Basal radiocarbon dates along surveyed transects are used to assess the pattern and timing of peatland formation and rates of lateral expansion. Previous palynological and lake-level studies from the same region provide independent evidence for changes in Holocene climate.
   Fen initiation in the region occurred throughout the Holocene under a broad range of environmental conditions. Once established, fens appear to expand faster during moister periods. Locally, substrate slope is an important mediator of fen development, with slopes >0.5% inhibiting lateral expansion. Accumulation of Sphagnum peat, an indicator of raised-bog initiation, occurred from approximate to 4000 to 5000 yr BP during relatively dry phases. Rates of lateral expansion were not significantly affected by increasing moisture or by decreasing temperatures until at least 2000 yr BP. However, modern geographic trends in cross-sectional shape of mires suggest that, at the northern limit of their range today, raised bogs are limited by low temperatures.

ID REGIONAL GROUNDWATER-FLOW; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS;
   ENGLAND; SYSTEMS; WALES; LAKES
AB Inflow of nutrient poor alkaline groundwater is generally seen as a prerequisite for the development of species rich fen vegetation. Drainage and groundwater abstraction may lead to the development of so-called rainwater lenses in the upper groundwater of fens, which prevent upward seeping alkaline groundwater from reaching the fen root zone. This threatens the conservation of the species rich vegetation. To provide insight in rainwater lens dynamics as a basis for conservation and restoration of fen biodiversity, numerical groundwater flow model simulations were performed for a hypothetical case area in the Netherlands.
   The simulations indicate that drainage canal surface water levels mainly affect the phreatic level in the fens, while groundwater inflow fluxes mainly affect the thickness of the rainwater lens. Increasing thickness of a semi-confining surface layer results in a rise in phreatic level. As the phreatic level reaches the soil surface, the rainwater lens may split in two as a result of groundwater discharge windows, which come into existence in the centre of the parcel. The effect of seasonal recharge fluctuations on the rainwater lens appears small. Spells of dry and wet years have a considerably larger effect especially on the lower boundary of the rainwater lens, resulting in thinner lenses during spells of dry years.
   Most simulations show rainwater lens thicknesses well exceeding rooting depths of fen plants. This is inconsistent with the fact that fen vegetation is found in nature reserves for which the simulations are considered representative. Chemical buffer processes in the soil may explain this inconsistency, masking an acidification process under way. As buffer capacities become exhausted over time, acidification and fen deterioration will occur at a certain future moment. To arrive at more definite conclusions about this hypothesis, our simulations of convective groundwater flow need to be supplemented by modelling of hydrochemical processes in rainwater lenses, followed by verification at actual field locations.

AB 1 Records of Empetrum nigrum pollen from blanket peat profiles at 18 sites in the southern Pennines, covering a variety of topographic situations, were collated. Inferences were drawn from the pollen database about climatic change over the last 3000 years and the time of onset of gully erosion of the peats.
   2 Interpretations of the pollen record were based on observations of the present-day distribution of E. nigrum in British blanket mires, and on studies by surface-sample analysis of its pollen production and dispersal at a North Wales bog. Empetrum favours better-drained situations such as hummocks and gully sides, and its pollen is dispersed only over short distances. Pollen was found in quantity only at one hummock site.
   3 Two episodes of high Empetrum pollen were found consistently in the peat profiles: prior to about 860 BC, and between c. AD 1100 and 1250. These episodes were interpreted as the product of extended periods of drier climate, At sites exhibiting severe gully erosion at the present day, high Empetrum pollen values have been maintained subsequent to AD 1250; sites along the middle and upper reaches of erosion gullies, however, show high values only within the last 200-250 years.
   4 Because of the sensitivity of the southern Pennine bog vegetation to climatic change, the stratigraphic record of Sphagnum and Racomitrium, macrofossils, in combination with the Empetrum urn pollen record, call be used to provide a framework of climatic change in the region over the last 3000 years.

AB There are very few studies on the spontaneous revegetation of cutover fens or bogs from which peat has been extracted to the minerotrophic layers. Most peatlands with fen-type residual peat have problems regenerating a plant cover satisfactorily from a restoration point of view. We nevertheless found a site (Moss Spur, Manitoba, Canada) presenting a substantial and diversified spontaneous plant cover. We estimated that the site would provide insights about natural revegetation processes operating in peatlands. Vegetation assemblages and environmental conditions were surveyed 19 years after extraction activities ceased. Moss Spur has densely revegetated (163 plant species, vegetation cover of 94%) with minimal human assistance. However, the composition of plant assemblages varies considerably across the site, depending on certain abiotic variables, particularly water pH, water table level, and the thickness of the residual peat layer. Moss Spur was remarkably wet considering the past peat extraction activities and the absence of active rewetting procedures. The high water table level may in part explain the successful revegetation. However, plant assemblages were not of equal quality from a restoration perspective. Some assemblages were highly diversified, and especially those dominated by Scirpus cyperinus, a species that should be further considered in peatland restoration projects to direct the recovery of the peatland towards a natural fen species composition.

AB Aim Bogs and transition mires in Central Europe have undergone tremendous changes in the last decades, declining in spatial extent and favourable conservation status. However, species extinctions have been documented only rarely because of a lack of reliable floristic data. Here, we assessed species losses of bog complexes and analysed their potential drivers.
   Location Black Forest, Germany.
   Methods We made use of the unique situation that the majority of bogs in the Black Forest (124 sites) had been systematically surveyed from 1972 to 1980 and resurveyed the flora of the same sites between 2017 and 2020. In addition, we included further data from the preceding decades.
   Results Out of 88 species for which we compiled site occupancy data, two species went extinct in the whole study area and 37 decreased from 1972 to 2020, losing on average 33% of their initial frequency. In contrast, 46 species displayed a positive trend. While decreasing species were characteristic of raised bogs, moorland ponds and base-rich mires, increasing species were typical of poor mires, fens and wet meadows. Species losses were higher at low elevation, pointing to increasing temperature increase and decreasing precipitation as main drivers of extinction, while habitat area, distance to the nearest site and land use played no significant role. The mean altitude at which extinctions of populations occurred increased with time. Assuming a continuation of the observed negative trends for declining bog species, our models predict the extinction of further ten species by 2045.
   Main Conclusion Our study highlights the value of systematic and comprehensive past biodiversity surveys to assess biodiversity change. We demonstrated that low-mountain habitats have already suffered biodiversity loss as a result of climate change. There are only limited management options against rising temperatures and decreasing precipitation.

AB Knowledge about the biodiversity of Canada's vast peatlands is poor largely because peatlands have not been routinely differentiated from other types of habitats. Plants are better known than the animals. Systematic surveys of peatland plants began in the late 1800s, but did not begin in earnest until the 1950s. With the exception of a few marshes, peatlands are classified into bogs (18 forms), fens (17 forms), and swamps (21 forms). Bogs are the most widespread compared to fens and swamps. Peatlands occur throughout most of Canada but are most common in the Boreal, Subarctic, and Arctic Wetland Regions. Species richness for plants clearly separates bogs and fens. Average number of total species is greater in fens than in bogs. Species richness of herbs, fern and fern allies, and bryophytes is greater in fens than in bogs, and it is greater in bogs for trees and lichens. Bryophytes contribute the most to species richness in bogs, while herbs are most important in fens. Bogs on the Atlantic coast appear to have greater species numbers of lichens and shrubs than bogs on the Pacific coast. Herbs likely contribute more to total species numbers in fens in eastern Canada than in western Canada. There are species of mammals, birds, herptiles, biting flies, beetles, dragon-flies, water mites, rotifers, and protozoans that are restricted to peatlands or are found in both peatlands and other habitats.

AB Selenium (Se) is one of the trace elements that is enriched in bitumen. To assess the importance of atmospheric Se deposition from mining and upgrading of bituminous sands in northern Alberta, Canada, Sphagnum moss was obtained from 25 bogs near industrial operations. The average Se concentration in moss near industries (58 +/- 13 mu g/kg; n = 75) was greater than in remote sites in Alberta (29-50 mu g/kg), but comparable to bogs in central regions of the province and lower than bogs in southern Ontario (121-244 mu g/kg) or the west and east coasts (230-285 mu g/kg). In bog vegetation and peat, arsenic (As) concentrations and accumulation rates are 10 times greater at the industrial site (MIL) compared to the control site (UTK), but this is proportional to the differences in scandium (a surrogate for mineral matter concentrations), which points to dust as the predominant As source. An age-dated peat core collected near industries revealed that both Se and As deposition have declined in recent years. A peat core from UTK provided a record of atmospheric deposition dating back over 2700 years, indicating that As and Se deposition in northern Alberta increased considerably in the early 19th century and then went into decline during similar to 1950-1970.

AB Climate change projections forecast an intensification of the precipitation regime for many regions of the globe, including central North America, with fewer, larger events interspersed between longer periods devoid of rain or snow. This shift has the potential to affect the carbon cycling of peatland ecosystems, including the flux of methane from the peat. We conducted a field manipulation experiment where irrigation treatments were used to simulate different seasonal rainfall regimes. The treatments were designed such that total seasonal rainfall was held constant but discrete event frequency and magnitude were altered between treatments in a poor fen in southern Ontario, Canada. The rainfall regime was controlled over three vegetation types: Sphagnum capillifolium (moss); Carex oligoperma (sedge); and Chamaedaphne calyculata (shrub). Decreasing rainfall frequency from thrice-weekly to bi-monthly [ coupled with 6X increase in event intensity] led to significantly greater CH4 flux from the moss and sedge communities in the latter third of the growing season. The shrub communities were unaffected by the changing rainfall regime. A companion lab mesocosm experiment revealed the control the fluctuating water table had on the CH4 fluxes from the vegetation community, particularly from the moss communities. Overall, there were significantly greater CH4 fluxes from all communities with increasing days since the previous rainfall event. As precipitation frequency decreases results of this study demonstrate the potential for increased CH4 flux to the atmosphere from peatland areas dominated by Sphagnum and herbaceous species. Wetland restoration and creation projects should consider these effects on peatland carbon cycling and function. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB Pollen and plant macrofossil sequence of a core at the margin of the Farnham bog provide a local developmental record that can be subdivided into five main stages for this part of the peatland. Organic sedimentation began around 8500 year BP in a shallow pound at the centre of the depression following the retreat of the Champlain Sea. Subsequent centrifugal paludification caused the onset of peat accumulation at the sampling point about 8100 year BP. An initial forested fen dominated by larch (1) has been rapidly followed by a treed fen (2) until 6900 year BP. This stage was succeeded by a fen characterized by sparse trees and the development of open-water pools (3) until 5800 year BP. At that time, the vegetation changed to oligotrophic bog (4) until the present. Recently, the influence of external factors such as fire and anthropogenic activity resulted (5) in the establishment of tree species typical of disturbed environments. Paludification and local developmental trends are closely controlled primarily by continuous peat accumulation, local hydrology, climate and fire. The formation of pools around 6900 year BP and the synchronous spread of Tsuga canadensis populations in the surrounding forests suggest an increasing trend towards moister conditions with higher precipitation and/or reduced summer evapotranspiration.

AB In a period with frequently occurring hydrological extremes, research on areas with a high retention potential is brought into focus. The Sumava Mountains peat bogs are important parts of the landscape in the headwater area of the Otava river basin. The study objective is to describe the variability of discharges and the dynamics of groundwater level changes in various types of peat bogs, and to identify connections between observed physico-chemical water properties. This is assessed by basic statistical methods. The rainfall-runoff process and physico-chemical water properties can be affected by many factors. In this case, strong relations between the observed parameters were identified along with considerable differences in the involvement of various types of peat bog sites in the runoff process. It is evident that the peat bog pattern and its vegetation cover have an essential effect on the hydrological regime and water properties stored in a peat bog.

AB In this study, we present a record spanning the last 4000 years from a Baltic bog (Kusowskie Bagno) in northern Poland. Using numerous biotic and abiotic proxies, such as testate amoebae (depth to water table reconstructions), stable carbon isotopes (C-13), plant macrofossils (proxies for local vegetation and mire surface wetness), pollen and spores (proxies for regional vegetation and human impact), we reconstructed and identified the regional hydro-climatic signal of Kusowskie Bagno bog and compared it to other bog records around the Baltic Sea. Our aims were to: 1) combine the species traits of bryophytes and testate amoebae, and more common proxies (isotopes, plant micro-and macro-remains) to infer past peatland development, 2) compare the hydroclimatic signal of Kusowskie Bagno bog to existing records around the Baltic Sea. We found that Kusowskie Bagno bog was very wet during the last 4000 years, and even drainage and peat exploitation had not disturbed its hydrology in northern part in the last 200 years. Carbon isotopes and plant macrofossils were significantly related to specific traits of testate amoebae, which in turn reflected the water table changes over the last 4000 years. Kusowskie Bagno recorded at least the following wet shifts: AD 250, 550, 850, 1250 and 1700, while wet conditions occurred during the Migration period at ca AD 550. Furthermore, the testate amoeba-based quantitative wetness reconstruction in Kusowskie Bagno bog resembles the pattern observed in other sites around the Baltic, i.e., Estonia, Finland, Ireland, northern Britain and the 7500-year record from the Stazki bog, northern Poland. Our results provided statistically validated evidence that interactions between plant and microbe need to be more considered further to reconstruct past hydrological. This is the first study of past hydro-climatic changes in peatlands based upon a trait-based approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present data on a transitional mire in South-Western Siberia that evolved from early thermokarst lake succession. The vegetation of the mire shows a remarkable zonation from the edges to the center. Vegetation, peat characteristics, pH and electric conductivity were recorded at 10 sites along a transect of 1.5 km. At two of the transect points with contrasting vegetation and succession stage (floating mat vs. birch forest) pore water peepers were inserted once for 3 weeks and pore waters of the upper 60 cm were analyzed for major anions and cations, and dissolved CO2 and CH4 concentrations. Pore waters substantially differed between the floating mat and the birch forest regarding base cation chemistry and pH whilst nutrient availability was comparable. Compared to literature, depth integrated productions (DIPs) of CH4 and CO2 were high for both sites but three times higher for the floating mat (CH4 10.89 mmol m(-2) d(-1), CO2 34.19 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Along with other reasons, the higher DOC input at this location seems to be responsible for the higher DIP by fueling higher microbial activity. We discuss driving factors for biogeochemical differences between both sites and draw conclusions on CH4 production during mire evolution.

AB In general, mires develop by autogenic succession from more groundwater-fed to more rainwater-fed. This study from a calcareous mire in the West Carpathians (Slovakia) describes a similar development in the Early Holocene, followed by a reverse development in the Middle and Late Holocene. Pollen, macrofossil and testate amoeba analyses show that the site started as a minerotrophic open fen woodland. After 10 700 cal a BP autogenic succession led to the accumulation of at least 1 m of Sphagnum fuscum peat. Around 9000 cal a BP, as climate could no longer sustain a stable water regime, the bog desiccated and a fire broke out. The fire removed part of the peat layer and as a consequence relative water levels rose, leading to the establishment of a wet minerotrophic swamp carr with Thelypteris palustris, Equisetum sp. and Alnus sp. with extremely slow peat accumulation. After 600 cal a BP, rapid peat accumulation with calcareous tufa formation resumed as a result of anthropogenic deforestation and hydrological changes in the catchment and resulting increased groundwater discharge. At present the mire still hosts a wealth of relict and endangered plant and animal species typical of calcareous fens and fen meadows. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Open-pit mining of oil sands removes wetland plant communities from the landscape. Sandhill Watershed, located on Syncrude Canada's oil sands lease, is the first reclamation of a complex watershed that includes a 17 ha central wetland designed to develop into a rich fen. Here we sample the vegetation after three years. Of the 124 plant species recorded, 48% are peat-forming species, including 24 bryophyte species. We identified, using ordination techniques, four plant assemblages that vary in abundance of peat-forming plants. Each assemblage occurs in a spatially distinct area of Sandhill Fen, forming vegetation zones that are closely associated with height of water table. The plant assemblage distributed in the wettest areas has abundant marsh species. The assemblages in the driest areas of the fen have large numbers of upland and weed species and few species characteristic of fens. In between is a species assemblage with an abundance of species characteristic of natural peat-forming habitats. Two key findings are: water levels control spatial distributions of species assemblages, and non-peat-forming plant species are abundant and a concern for the establishment of peat-forming wetlands. Future designs should include plans for a number of interconnected site types such as marshes, fens, and riparian areas.

AB We explored the background of differences in long-term stability between two parts in an undisturbed mire system (Rospuda fen, NE Poland). We re-constructed the Holocene history of the mire and compared it with current vegetation, water level dynamics, water chemistry and nutrient availability in two basins: A, where the mire terrestrialised a deep gyttja-filled lake, and B, where peatland developed directly on fluvial sands. The current vegetation of sedge-moss fens was described in 10 relev,s from each basin, groundwater was sampled from piezometers and analysed for major ions, while its relative water level was recorded during three years. N and P content was measured in above ground vascular plant samples collected within the relev,s. Fens in basin A were stable in the past, whereas fens in basin B switched between open and wooded or reed-dominated phases. In basin B, where trees are more abundant, we found higher water fluctuations, occurrence of river floods and a higher N:P ratio than in basin A. Our interpretation follows that the subsurface geology of fen basin may govern mire stability by determining its hydrological-buffering capacity, which may affect N:P ratios. Our results suggest that P-limited fens are more vulnerable for changes in water level.

AB We analysed a continuous and well-dated record of pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, geochemistry and plant macroremains from the best preserved peat bog in the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands (Czech Republic). Darko peat bog is an isolated site of a pine bog woodland dominated by the central-European endemic Pinus uncinata subsp. uliginosa. It is protected as a National Nature Reserve and a Site of Community Importance. We describe major patterns and interesting details of the development of this site since the Late Glacial and provide a historical context for some natural phenomena of high conservation value. Until the High Middle Ages, macroclimate and autogenic succession appear to have been the main drivers of both the local and regional development of vegetation. The pine-dominated Late Glacial vegetation with cold-loving taxa survived until the first millennia of the Holocene. The first Late Glacial and Holocene record of Isoetes lacustris outside its present range in this country indicates the presence of a cold oligotrophic waterbody in this period. Corylus, Picea and mixed oak forest taxa started to expand already around 10,500 cal. BP. Indicators of a warm oceanic climate appeared around 7700 cal. BP and the AP:NAP ratio increased gradually up to its Holocene maximum close to 99%. Around 6800 cal. BP, the minerotrophic wetland developed into an ombrotrophic bog. Picea, Fagus and Abies started to dominate the pollen assemblage around 5500 cal. BP. Between AD 1100 and 1350, an abrupt change in the vegetation started, which coincided with the High Medieval colonization of the region. The pronounced peak of Pb in the geochemical record between AD 1200 and 1650 reflects extensive metallurgical activities in a wider area. Valuable pine bog woodland appeared only around AD 1500, when pine expanded. This late expansion, also recorded elsewhere, may have been triggered by human activities, which challenges the present non-intervention management of this habitat. The present marginal occurrence of fen species in the bog lagg may be considered a relict of Late Glacial and Early Holocene minerotrophic fen vegetation, the preservation of which requires active management. This study shows how palaeoecological knowledge helps explain present patterns in the composition of a valuable protected site. This knowledge may be used in prioritising conservation and in communicating the nature conservation goals to the public.

AB A water budget analysis (precipitation (P), surface runoff (Q), evapotranspiration (ET) and storage variations (Delta S)) was completed over a 3-year span for two Sphagnum bogs, three patterned fens and two shallow lakes all located in the La Grande River watershed in central Quebec. The high variability of P from 2005 to 2007 during summer and fall (July to October) allowed us to produce water budgets over a large spectrum of wetness conditions at seasonal and event timescales. Bogs and fens (not lakes) have the intrinsic ability to keep the water table near the surface most of the time, which affects Q. Fens and lakes showed a similar hydrological behavior when compared to bogs, in spite of differences in Q and Delta S variability due to the typical vegetation structure of fens. This structure also tends to produce sharper rises of Q when compared to lakes that have overall smoother hydrograms. The dominant water budget term for bogs, fens and lakes was Delta S, Q and Er, respectively. Finally, an adaptation of the Penman-Monteith equation was successfully used to estimate potential ET. This revised method is based on peatland vegetation identification that provides a simple weighing factor for stomatal resistance.

AB This study clarifies the area distribution of Estonian peat soils by three factors: main peat soil groups, peat thickness and peat decomposition degree. A digital soil map (1: 10,000) and supplementary database were used for summarizing the distribution of peat soils. From the combined database with 859,701 polygons the soil mapping unit code, formula of soil texture (including peat) and formula of epipedon fabric were compiled using the MapInfo software. Peat soils form altogether 10,038 km(2) or 23.5% of the total Estonian soil cover. From the peat soils the fen soils form 59.0%, bog soils 21.7% and transitional bog soils 14.7%. 45% of peat soils are well, 26% moderately and 29% slightly decomposed, by the peat thickness 13% are very shallow, 21% shallow and 66% thick. The general ecological characterization of peat soils and their mutual relationship with plant cover are given for the main peat soil taxa. The dominant natural ecosystems formed on peatlands are: (1) mixed birch, alder, spruce and pine forests on thin (<100 cm) well decomposed eutrophic fen soils, and (2) a sparse pine forests and hummock-ridge-hollow raised bogs wooded sparsely by pine on thick (> 100 cm) slightly decomposed oligotrophic bog soils. The accumulation of organic carbon in peatlands soil cover (0-50 cm) totals 269.4+/-12.7 Tg and in epipedon layer (as superficial part of soil cover; 0-30 cm) 129.9+/-5.8 Tg. The former is sequestrated into 543.7 Tg of peat, which forms 22.9% of the total Estonian peat resources (2.37 Pg).

AB We examined long-term rates of dry peat accumulation in 32 C-14-dated cores from poor fens in Alaska, to bogs and fens in midcontinental North Dakota and Minnesota, to oceanic bogs in Maine and the Atlantic Provinces of Canada. Sites along this belt transect exhibit mostly linear relationships between cumulative mass and age. Long-term rates of peat accumulation range from 16 to 80 g.m(-2).year(-1), with a median rate of 47 g.m(-2).year(-1) and a mean rate of 50 g.m(-2).year(-1). Rate of accumulation is inversely correlated with mean annual precipitation, but is not correlated with the area of the peat basin, basal age, or mean annual temperature. Four of the five highest rates are from relatively dry midcontinental locations in North Dakota and Minnesota; the other is for a coastal site in Newfoundland. The two lowest rates are from extremely rainy sites on Pleasant Island in the Alaskan panhandle. Individual accumulation rates between adjacent dates are quite variable within the peat cores, and across the transect, they do not correlate significantly with immediately previous rates. The same is true of the four sites with the greatest numbers of dates. There is a small but significant negative correlation within the Red Lake Peatland.

AB A broad sample of 79 montane fens in the Sierra Nevada revealed that underlying geology and topography exert strong control over the distribution and vegetation of these ecosystems. Distinct granodiorite, metamorphic, volcanic, carbonate and serpentine bedrock geology resulted in very different water chemistry, which had significant effects on the particular plant species found at each site. Wide-ranging values of pH (4.28-8.00) and dissolved cation concentrations (1.6-62.0 mg L-1) spanned the categories of transitional poor-rich to extremely rich fens. The vegetation of a pair of fens on carbonate bedrock and two floating mat fens was markedly different from the vegetation recorded at any other study sites. Once these outlier fens were removed from the analyses, the environmental variables that correlated most closely with the vegetation data were pH, altitude, presence of volcanic bedrock and fen slope. The measured environmental parameters explained 9.7 % of the variability in the vegetation data. Species richness was primarily (and negatively) correlated with altitude. Peat thickness (15-253 cm) was constrained in smaller catchments and on steeper slopes, and was positively correlated with soil organic matter content (16-92 %). Of the four typical fen landforms (bedrock contact, slope, spring mound and basin), sloping fens were the most common (63 % of the 79-fen sample).

AB The objective of this study was to examine plant community development and peat stratigraphy in the context of ground-water flow systems for five forested peatlands in central New York State for which extensive vegetation, surface hydrology, and water chemistry analyses has been performed. Peatland development trends, from the initial period of peat accumulation to the present, were explored using pear stratigraphy, analysis of ground-water flow systems and evidence fi om existing vegetation. Detailed analyses, including the construction of numerical ground-water models were performed for one of the five sites to examine the process of bog development within what was once a highly calcareous fen and to examine the impacts of agricultural drainage on peatland ground-water flow. Feat stratigraphy analysis indicated two pathways of peatland development: infilling of shallow lakes and peat accumulation on ground-water seeps. Lake-infill peatlands were characterized by a sequence of Limnic peat--> bryophyte-sedge peat-->hemic-fibric sedge peat-->sapric wood peat (or Sphagnum peat). Analysis of ground-water flow systems indicated that four of the peatlands were characterized by mineral-rich ground-water discharge along peatland margins, with lateral flow through the peatlands towards drainage features. The fifth peatland was characterized by a more complex ground-water flow system with a weakly minerotrophic water-table mound driving shallow ground-water recharge flow. The water-table mound has been reduced in extent by agricultural drainage and demonstrates seasonal fluctuations in hydraulic head and areal extent.

AB Stratigraphical analyses based on 1028 dated Holocene peat cores were used to estimate the rate of carbon accumulation in Finnish peatlands. Results were compared with data from other Boreal areas. The basal age of peat columns was found to be the best predictor of carbon accumulation and a significant correlation between depth and age of peat was evident. When normalized for the mean depth of peatlands in Finland (c. 1.5 m), the average long-term carbon accumulation was 26.1 g C m(-2) yr(-1). In individual cores the values ranged from 2.8 to 88.6 g (average 22.5 +/- 11.6 g) being much higher in bogs than in fens and almost double in southern mires as compared with those in the northern Boreal zone. The modelled rate of actual carbon accumulation is about 2/3 of that above. Boreal mires are actual sinks of carbon for thousands of years ahead in the present climate. The predicted greenhouse warming may shift the present Sphagnum mires northward and the net effect may be to restrain the radiative forcing. Poorly known 3D mass accumulation in mires and unpredictable functioning of northern mire ecosystems to climatic changes (for example via increased mire fires) complicate this interpretation.

AB In this paper, the history of Durne Bagno, i.e. the largest peat bog in the Lublin Polesie, is shown. Peat bogs are a unique element of the Polesie landscape. They occur mostly in the subregion of the Leczna-Wlodawa Lake District occupying 1.07% of its area. They fill basin-shaped depressions without outflow, often in the immediate vicinity of dystrophic lakes. Based on interdisciplinary research, the changes of vegetation cover and the Durne Bagno lake-mire ecosystem in the Late Glacial and Holocene are presented. The environmental conditions are reconstructed from pollen analysis, detailed identification of algae of Pediastrum genus and chemical composition of deposits, together with the results of Cladocera analysis. The distribution of archaeological artefacts in the surroundings of Durne Bagno peat bog gives the view on the intensity of settlement in this area. The duration of the limnic and mire stages during the development of the ecosystem was different in different parts of the examined depression. In its central part the limnic stage lasted about 8000 years and included the period from the Late Glacial to the middle Holocene (to about 6000 BP). It is represented by 7 pollen zones and 6 chemical zones. The mire stage contained a part the Atlantic period and on the Subboreal and Subatlantic periods. It is represented by 4 pollen zones and 5 chemical zones. Limnic and mire deposits differ widely in the concentrations of chemical elements. The contents of mineral material and almost all analyzed elements in limnic deposits are high. These deposits are characterized by positive correlation between the contents of Zn and Cr and the frequency of Cladocera fauna. Peat contains very low amount of mineral material. The contents of Ca, Sr and Ba are rather high in sedge-moss peat. The concentrations of these elements decrease upwards due to oligotrophic processes and sedentation of sedge-Eriophorum-Sphagnum peat. Peat succession was modified by pastoral economy of prehistoric man.

AB Peatland soils represent globally significant stores of carbon, and understanding carbon cycling pathways in these ecosystems has important implications for global climate change. We measured aceticlastic and autotrophic methanogenesis, sulfate reduction, denitrification, and iron reduction in a bog, an intermediate fen, and a rich fen in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan for one growing season. In 3-d anaerobic incubations of slurried peat, denitrification and iron reduction were minor components of anaerobic carbon mineralization. Experiments using C-14-labeled methanogenic substrates showed that methanogenesis in these peatlands was primarily through the aceticlastic pathway, except early in the growing season in more ombrotrophic peatlands, where the autotrophic pathway was dominant or codominant. Overall, methane production was responsible for 3-70% of anaerobic carbon mineralization. Sulfate reduction accounted for 0-26% of anaerobic carbon mineralization, suggesting a rapid turnover of a very small sulfate pool. A large percentage of anaerobic carbon mineralization (from 29% to 85%) was unexplained by any measured process, which could have resulted from fermentation or possibly from the use of organic molecules (e.g., humic acids) as alternative electron acceptors.

AB Forms and accumulation of soil phosphorus (P) were measured in a subalpine quaking peatland on Mt. Changbai in China that is located 1 km from the North Korea border. Peat cores were collected from four sites and radiometrically dated to determine long-term (Pb-210-based) rates of peat and P accumulation. Soil P forms at different depths in four peat cores were determined by a modified Hedley fraction method. In the minerotrophic fens (fen-W, fen-S, and fen-E), total P (P-t), organic P (P-o), NaOH extractable P-o (NaOH-P-o) and Residual-P ranged from 809 +/- 192 to 1214 +/- 530, 455 +/- 121 to 736 +/- 373, 282 +/- 100 to 462 +/- 247, and 152 +/- 36 to 325 +/- 118 mg P kg(-1), respectively. In an ombrotrophic bog (bog-N), the corresponding values were 705 +/- 163, 387 +/- 125, 204 +/- 103, and 101 +/- 15 mg P kg(-1) respectively. Many of those were higher in the fens than in the bog. Significantly different accumulation rates of peat were determined for the fens (0.063 to 0.081 g DM cm(-2) yr(-1)) and bog (0.038 g DM cm(-2) yr(-1)). Compared with other peatlands, the accumulation of Pt in the Yuanchi peatland (0.69 +/- 0.4 to 2.04 +/- 0.6 g P m(-2) yr(-1)) was higher, suggesting that the volcanic parent material had an influence on P accumulation.

AB The restoration of wetland ecosystems is one of the flagships of modern conservation ecology, and the development of methodologies is vital to the enhancement of biodiversity. Bogs in northeastern Estonia have been under intensive pressure from alkaline fly ash pollution emitted by oil shale-heated power plants since the 1950s. In the vicinity of pollution sources, the input of alkaline fly ash has increased the ash content in mosses and raised the pH value of bog water, which had caused the replacement of Sphagnum mosses by other bryophytes and the invasion of eutrophic plants by the 1980s. The results of our study show that in recent decades, after the reduction in atmospheric input by power plants, the ash content in mosses has fallen, bog water pH is lower, and bog-specific plant species have begun to return to the bogs that were moderately polluted in recent decades. However, historically heavily polluted bogs show little signs of self-restoration, and their vegetation is still threatened by continuing degradation. Based on the wide gradient of pollution intensity, we suggested a list of indicators that can be used to evaluate bog degradation rates and restoration success.

AB 1 A general model of peatland dynamics is presented that emphasizes the interaction between water table depth and peat production. The model consists of two coupled, non-linear differential equations representing change in depth of peat and depth to the water table. Several simplified models are also considered to show the logical development of this model from previously published ones. The model provides an integrated view of how peatlands function over long time scales, by focusing on the non-linear interactions among peat production, decomposition and hydrology.
   2 Analysis of the model shows that equilibrium peat accumulation and water table depth depend on the net water input to the peatland. In drier sites, peatlands with relatively deep water tables develop and the equilibrium peat depth increases with increasing water input. In very wet conditions, peatlands have water tables near the surface, peat accumulation is limited by low production rates, and equilibrium peat depth is lower than is possible in comparatively drier sites. Over a range of intermediate water balances, there are two simultaneous equilibrium states where deep, dry peatlands and shallower, wet peatlands can both occur. This sensitivity to water balance suggests that small changes in precipitation regime, such as are expected with climate variability and change, could rapidly convert peatlands that are now in equilibrium into either sources or sinks of carbon.

AB Vegetation, temperature and hydrology are major factors controlling wetland methane (CH4) dynamics. In order to test their importance, we measured CH4 emissions and environmental characteristics over 2 years from five mires representing a successional sequence, ranging in age from 178 to 2,520 years. We hypothesized CH4 emissions to be higher from the sedge-dominated fens than from the older bog stage. The more constant hydrological conditions at later successional stages as a consequence of the thicker peat layer appeared to result in lower temporal variation in CH4 emissions. Accordingly, the other controls, temperature and vegetation, had an effect on CH4 emissions only when the water table was sufficiently high. The seasonal variation in CH4 emissions was controlled by temperature only at the oldest study site, which had the lowest variation in water table. Within-season variation in emissions related to plant phenology was highest at the fen stage, which was dominated by aerenchymatous plants with a strong seasonal pattern, namely sedges and forbs. In contrast to our hypothesis, CH4 emissions increased with mire age towards the bog stage. However, the trend did not emerge during a rainy growing season, due to a rise in CH4 emissions at the younger stages. The results may imply two different mechanisms during mire succession: while old mires are able to avoid the perturbation associated with variation in the water table and maintain their function as CH4 emitters, young mires are exposed to perturbation but are able to recover their function.

AB The evaporation regimes of two northern New Zealand raised peat bogs with vegetation dominated by the restionaceous rush Sporadanthus traversii were investigated. One of the bogs is unmodified while the other is affected by the drainage practices of surrounding agricultural land. Measurements of the latent heat flux obtained concurrently with Bowen ratio and eddy covariance techniques were in close agreement, and good energy balance closure was demonstrated when there was adequate fetch. Evaporation rates and energy partitioning behaviour were similar for the two bogs despite differences in water table elevation and peat moisture content. Evaporation rates averaged 2.9 mm day(-1), equivalent to 55% of the equilibrium evaporation rate. Energy balance partitioning favoured the sensible heat flux, and Bowen ratios of around 2 were common. The importance of the latent heat flux in the energy balance depended on the state of canopy wetness following frequent rainfall events. When the canopy was completely wet, evaporation rates approximated, or exceeded, the equilibrium evaporation rate. Evaporation rates were evidently constrained by a combination of plant physiological and canopy structural factors which combined to prevent high rates of evaporation from the moist peat surface. These findings provide evidence of strong canopy-hydrological feedbacks within the raised peat bogs of northern New Zealand which result in conditions favourable for peat formation.

AB The uppermost portion of the peat profile, an area of active diagenetic processes, is exceedingly important for understanding peatland dynamics and the diagenesis and geochemistry of atmospherically-deposited materials. We investigated high resolution carbon (C) accrual and peat decomposition rates at two Sphagnum-rich ombrotrophic bogs and one fen in northern Minnesota, USA by analyzing 1 cm increments from 30 cm thick intact frozen blocks of peat soil. We conducted radiocarbon analysis of Sphagnum cellulose to determine peat age and net C accumulation at each depth interval. Calibrated peat ages were determined using CALIBomb and a compilation of calibration datasets for the pre-bomb period. We fit data with a negative exponential accumulation model and used model-derived parameters to estimate net primary productivity (NPP) and a peat decomposition rate constant k. FTIR spectroscopy and C:N were used to derive humification indices and to chemically characterize the peat. NPP ranged from 180 to 266 g C m(-2) year(-1), k ranged from 0.015 to 0.019 year(-1). Net C accumulation rates ranged from 112 to 174 g C m(-2) year(-1) at 25 years and 70 to 113 g C m(-2) year(-1) at 50 years. Mass loss was up to 55% during the first 50 years of peat accumulation. Decomposition is greater at depth in the bogs-where 25 cm of peat correspond to 55 years of peat accumulation-than in the fen, where peat age is approximately 25 years at 25 cm depth. Information on fine-scale variations in peat mass decomposition and loss across ombrotrophic bogs and a fen help interpret other diagenetic processes in peatlands.

AB The mineral-bound organic matter (OM) in soils is of great importance for the global carbon cycle. Long-standing debate exists regarding the mechanisms of soil organic matter (SOM) preservation and, especially, the role of organo-clay mineral associations. Investigation of such associations is rarely undertaken in peat soils. In this study, we examine organo-clay relationships in the Dajiuhu peat soil in Hubei Province, central China, based on molecular markers, which allows for understanding of rates of OM degradation and the preservation of OM associated with clay minerals. We analyzed the major and trace element chemistry, clay mineralogy, and lipid compositions of both the coarse- and clay-sized fractions of the soil. The uniformity of trace element and REE distribution patterns in the soil (except for Layer 2) suggests that the source materials were well mixed. Chemical index of alteration (CIA) values of 70-85 indicate moderate to strong weathering processes. A significant correlation between C-org:P and TOC may indicate that redox conditions were a significant control on OM preservation. The clay fraction of Dajiuhu peatland soils also has played an important role in preserving OM, especially in anoxic environments. Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis show that OM is absorbed mainly on the edges of illite grains rather than in interlayer sites. The amphoteric margins of illite crystals allow them to more effectively bind organic compounds. The high R-1/h ratio, high carbon preference index (CPI), and high ratio of unsaturated-to-saturated fatty acids (C-18:2/C-18) in the clay sized fraction provide further biomarker evidence that illite efficiently protects OM from biodegradation, thus enhancing the OM content of soils.

AB Permafrost patterning in boreal peatlands contributes to landscape heterogeneity, as peat plateaus, palsas, and localized permafrost mounds are interspersed among unfrozen bogs and fens. The degradation of localized permafrost in peatlands alters local topography, hydrology, thermal regimes, and plant communities, and creates unique peatland features called "internal lawns." I used laboratory incubations to quantify carbon dioxide (CO2) production in peat formed under different permafrost regimes (with permafrost, without permafrost, melted permafrost), and explored the relationships among proximate organic matter fractions, nutrient concentrations, and decomposition. Peat within each feature (internal lawn, bog, permafrost mound) is more chemically similar than peat collected within the same province (Alberta, Saskatchewan) or within depth intervals (surface, deep). Internal lawn peat produces more CO2 than the other peatland types. Across peatland features, acid-insoluble material (AIM) and AIM/nitrogen are significant predictors of decomposition. However, within each peatland feature, soluble proximate fractions are better predictors Of CO2 production. Permafrost stability in peatlands influences plant and soil environments, which control litter inputs, organic matter quality, and decomposition rates. Spatial patterns of permafrost, as well as ecosystem processes within various permafrost features, should be considered when assessing the fate of soil carbon in northern ecosystems.

AB In this paper we present the results of a geophysical study of water distribution in the peat bog at Luitel Lake. The goal of the study was to determine water distribution within the bog, which is part of a protected nature preserve. The small peat bog (17 ha) provides a good test site for developing and testing surface geophysical methods. For this study we used magnetic resonance sounding (MRS), electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR). Because the water distribution in the bog is a 2D target for MRS, we had to develop a measuring procedure and 2D inversion routine for MRS. The fieldwork consisted in establishing seventeen MRS stations and conducting three ERT profiles and one GPR line. The MRS, ERT and GPR results on the reservoir geometry correlated well with each other. Pine and birch trees cover most of the bog surface but they have not yet populated the centre of the bog, the location where the maximum water content was observed. This result agrees well with vegetation distribution in the study area: at the centre of the bog, vegetation is typical of a swampy environment but outside the centre the vegetation is typical of a forest. According to MRS, the water content of the peat formation at the centre of the bog is 60-70%, whereas GPR estimated the water content to be between 64-70%. Outside the centre, MRS showed the water content of the peat to be about 30%.

AB Raised bogs have accumulated more atmospheric carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem on Earth. Climate-induced expansion of trees and shrubs may turn these ecosystems from net carbon sinks into sources when associated with reduced water tables. Increasing water loss through tree evapotranspiration could potentially deepen water tables, thus stimulating peat decomposition and carbon release. Bridging the gap between modelling and field studies, we conducted a three-year mesocosm experiment subjecting natural bog vegetation to three birch tree densities, and studied the changes in subsurface temperature, water balance components, leaf area index and vegetation composition. We found the deepest water table in mesocosms with low tree density. Mesocosms with high tree density remained wettest (i.e. highest water tables) whereas the control treatment without trees had intermediate water tables. These differences are attributed mostly to differences in evapotranspiration. Although our mesocosm results cannot be directly scaled up to ecosystem level, the systematic effect of tree density suggests that as bogs become colonized by trees, the effect of trees on ecosystem water loss changes with time, with tree transpiration effects of drying becoming increasingly offset by shading effects during the later phases of tree encroachment. These density-dependent effects of trees on water loss have important implications for the structure and functioning of peatbogs.

AB Shrubification of arctic tundra is a well-recognized phenomenon, and it can be particularly rapid in moist habitats. Reindeer grazing can inhibit shrubification, but grazing impacts on mire vegetation have been overlooked. We studied grazing effects on plant communities and Salix lapponum in oroarctic mires at the border of Finland and Norway. We compared plant community structure and S. lapponum abundance and traits between (1) grazed fens (Finland); (2) experimental exclosures (Finland), where reindeer have been kept out for 13 years; and (3) nongrazed fens (Norway). Grazing effect on shrubification was assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and leaf area index (LAI). We did not find a uniform direction of vegetation change connected to the exclosure treatment, and grazing treatments were overlapping in multivariate ordination. Neither NDVI nor LAI indicated clear differences. Instead, significant results were revealed in total abundance of species groups and in S. lapponum traits. The cover of bryophytes was significantly lower under free grazing. Reindeer grazing reduced the abundance, height, and flowering and increased leaf N concentration of S. lapponum. We conclude that reindeer grazing controls willows and affects total abundance of important species groups, and plant community structure is resistant to grazing effects in oroarctic mires.

AB Northern peatlands are a large repository of atmospheric carbon due to an imbalance between primary production by plants and microbial decomposition. The James Bay Lowlands (JBL) of northern Ontario are a large peatland-complex but remain relatively unstudied. Climate change models predict the region will experience warmer and drier conditions, potentially altering plant community composition, and shifting the region from a long-term carbon sink to a source. We collected a peat core from two geographically separated (ca. 200 km) ombrotrophic peatlands (Victor and Kinoje Bogs) and one minerotrophic peatland (Victor Fen) located near Victor Bog within the JBL. We characterized (i) archaeal, bacterial, and fungal community structure with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of ribosomal DNA, (ii) estimated microbial activity using community level physiological profiling and extracellular enzymes activities, and (iii) the aeration and temperature dependence of carbon mineralization at three depths (0-10, 50-60, and 100-110 cm) from each site. Similar dominant microbial taxa were observed at all three peatlands despite differences in nutrient content and substrate quality. In contrast, we observed differences in basal respiration, enzyme activity, and the magnitude of substrate utilization, which were all generally higher at Victor Fen and similar between the two bogs. However, there was no preferential mineralization of carbon substrates between the bogs and fens. Microbial community composition did not correlate with measures of microbial activity but pH was a strong predictor of activity across all sites and depths. Increased peat temperature and aeration stimulated CO2 production but this did not correlate with a change in enzyme activities. Potential microbial activity in the JBL appears to be influenced by the quality of the peat substrate and the presence of microbial inhibitors, which suggests the existing peat substrate will have a large influence on future JBL carbon dynamics.

AB Mires are characterized by plant communities of high conservation and societal value, which have experienced a major decline in area in many parts of the world, particularly Europe. Evidence suggests that they may be particularly vulnerable to changes in climate and nutrient addition. Although they have been the focus of extensive paleoecological research, few attempts have been made to examine the dynamics of mire vegetation during the current era of anthropogenic environmental change.
   To assess long-term change in the spatial structure and composition of a lowland mire community, in 2016 we resurveyed plots first surveyed in 1951. Measures of species richness and composition were compared between the two surveys, and changes in community composition were related to plant traits.
   Overall, mean species richness declined by 26%. The area of occupancy declined in 37% of species, which were primarily oligotrophic species typical of nutrient-poor bog communities. Conversely, occupancy increased in 21% of species, especially those that were more tolerant of higher nutrient availability. These changes were associated with variation in plant functional traits, as indicated by an increase mean Ellenberg trait values for nitrogen and mean temperature, and a decline in values for precipitation. These results suggest that eutrophication and climate change have been key drivers of floristic change on this site.
   Synthesis. This investigation provides a rare assessment of the dynamics of a mire community over a multi-decadal interval. Results indicate that substantial change has occurred in the composition of the community, and the distribution of species within it. The investigation provides evidence of the impact of environmental change on the composition and structure of a lowland mire community, and highlights challenges for its future conservation.

AB Northern peatlands store similar to 500 Pg of carbon (C); however, controls on the spatial distribution of the stored C may differ regionally, owing to the complex interaction among climate, ecosystem processes, and geophysical controls. As a globally significant C sink, elucidation of controls on the distribution of C in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada (HBL), is of particular importance. Although peat age is related to timing of land emergence and peat depth in the HBL, considerable variation in the total C mass (kg m(-2)) among sites of similar peat age suggests that other factors may explain spatial patterns in C storage (Pg) and sequestration. Here we quantify the role of two key factors in explaining the spatial distribution of the C mass in the HBL (n = 364 sites), (i) climate variability and (ii) peat lithology, for two major peatland classes in the HBL (bogs and fens). We find that temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration each explained nearly half of the C mass variability. Regions characterized by warmer and wetter conditions stored the most C as peat. Our results show that bogs and fens store similar amounts of C within a given climate domain, although via distinct storage mechanisms. Namely, fen peats tend to be shallower and more C dense (kg m(-3)) compared to bogs. Following geophysical controls on the timing of peat initiation, our results reveal that both the widespread bog-fen patterning and variability in regional climate contribute to explaining the spatial distribution of the peat C mass in the HBL.

AB Results of a fossil Coleoptera (beetle) fauna from a fen edge sequence from Hatfield Moors, Humberhead Levels, England, are presented. Mire ontogeny inferred from this location and others are discussed, particularly in the light of previous palynological and plant macrofossil investigations. Peat initiation across most of the site centres around 3000 cal. BC, characterized by a Calluna-Eriophorum heath with areas of Pinus-Betula woodland. The onset of peat accumulation on the southern margins of the site was delayed until 15201390 cal. BC and appears to overlap closely with a recurrence surface at a pollen site (HAT 2) dated to 16101440 cal. BC, suggesting that increased surface wetness may have caused mire expansion at this time. The faunas illustrate the transition from eutrophic and mesotrophic fen to ombrotrophic raised mire, although the significance of both Pinus- and Calluna-indicating species through the sequence suggests that heath habitats may have continued to be important. Elsewhere, this earlier phase of rich fen is lacking and mesotrophic mire developed immediately above nutrient-poor sands, with ombrotrophic conditions indicated soon after. Correspondence analysis of the faunas provides valuable insights into the importance of sandy heath habitats on Hatfield Moors. The continuing influence of the underlying coversands suggests these may have been instrumental in mire ontogeny. The research highlights the usefulness of using Coleoptera to assess mire ontogeny, fluctuations in site hydrology and vegetation cover, particularly when used in conjunction with other peatland proxies. The significance of a suite of extinct beetle species is discussed with reference to forest history and climatic change.

Data collected in wells and piezometers along 10 transects (within 6 bogs), of the New Brunswick Eastern Lowlands are used to analyse the hydraulic and hydrochemical gradients, while airborne LiDAR data provides new insight on the geomorphology and the vegetation patterns of the bog-lagg-mineral transition zone. Based on their geomorphic character, the study transects are placed into 2 categories: confined and unconfined. Laggs of confined transition are found in a topographic depression, between the bog and a mineral slope >1%, while laggs of unconfined transitions are adjacent to a flat (<= 1%) or receding mineral slope (sloping away from the lagg). Water level (4 +/- 9 cm vs. -3 +/- 9 cm), pH (4.8 +/- 0.9 vs. 4.2 +/- 0.4), electrical conductivity (ECcorr) (105 +/- 52 mu S cm(-1) vs. 52 +/- 28 mu S cm(-1)) and peat depth (55 +/- 9 cm vs. 30 +/- 9 cm) are found to be higher, respectively, for the confined laggs than for the unconfined. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) of the lagg's upper peat layer resembles that of bog environments, but quickly reduces with depth, impeding Vertical water flow. The greatest abiotic control of the lagg appears to be topography, which affects water flow rates and direction, thus water chemistry, nutrient transport and availability, hence vegetation characteristics. Our results suggest that the features of the transition zone that include the lagg, influence the quantity and variability of water within the adjacent peatland, and should be considered as integral part of the peatland complex.

AB The floating mat fens of the Tanana Flats in interior Alaska are productive wetlands near the urban center of Fairbanks. Airboat traffic has created a network of trails through the floating vegetation mats. We established protected areas along established trails, which allowed for measurement of plant community resistance to airboat traffic and resilience following cessation of traffic. The fen plant community was resistant to airboat traffic for two growing seasons, but productivity declined dramatically by the third year. Woody plants, grasses, and most forbs were eliminated in new airboat trails. Aboveground biomass and species diversity in plots protected from airboat traffic re-grew to undisturbed levels after four years. However, woody plants and many forbs did not re-grow in protected areas. Fen vegetation was therefore not resilient following cessation of traffic, as re-grown communities differed in both plant community composition and canopy structure. The loss of woody vegetation in particular has ramifications for possible alterations of ecosystem function. Airboats also reduced the amount of live belowground biomass and changed the vertical distribution of live roots.

AB Six calcareous fens in the Minnesota River Basin, USA are in regional hydrogeologic settings with large discharges of calcareous ground water. These settings juxtapose topographically high areas of ground-water recharge with fens in lower areas of discharge, thus creating steep upward hydraulic gradients at the fens. Coarse glacial deposits with high permeability connect recharge areas to discharge areas and transmit large amounts of ground water to the fens. Calcareous fens in the Minnesota River Basin are associated with two regional landforms, river terraces and glacial moraines. The calcareous drift is the likely source of carbonate for the fens; carbonate bedrock is not required. Five of the calcareous fens form peat aprons over broad areas of diffuse ground-water discharge on river terraces. One of the calcareous fens is a peat dome over an aquifer window, a relatively small area (about 15-m radius) of localized ground-water discharge through a breach in the clayey confining layer of the underlying aquifer. Carbonate content of calcareous fen peat averaged about 27% (calcium carbonate equivalent, dry weight basis) in the surface layer, which commonly overlies a carbonate-depleted zone with a carbonate content of 10% or less. Hydraulic conductivity (K) of calcareous fen peat determined from slug tests ranged from 2.7 x 10(-7) to 9.8 x 10(-5) m s(-1) and had a geometric mean of 3.8 x 10(-6) m s(-1). These values likely underestimate the true horizontal hydraulic conductivity (K-h) and overestimate the true vertical hydraulic conductivity (K-v) because of errors in assumptions commonly used in slug-test analyses. Median (over time) hydraulic heads in wells screened below the base of the peat ranged from about 25 to 69 cm above the peat surface. Upward vertical gradients (dimensionless) through the peat ranged from 0.040 to 0.209. Vertical ground-water discharge was calculated by Darcy's Law and ranged from 2 to 172 L m(-2) d(-1). Because of bias in estimating K-v, these values likely overestimate the true vertical ground-water discharge and indicate the importance of better field methods to estimate K, especially K-v. Calcareous fens may need water tables sustained near the peat surface by large vertical ground-water discharges to allow carbonate precipitation, which is associated with the rare fen vegetation.

AB Two different types of mire which had been subject to drainage for about 40 years before restoration of the water table have been studied. The abundance and distribution of testaceans were assessed in both mires before and after restoration. Human activities have changed the moisture conditions and surface chemistry of the mires. The occurrence of testate amoebae was related to the peat stratigraphy, plant remains and peat chemistry, and signs of the effects of these human activities were sought. Testacean shells were abundant throughout the full depth of peat studied in the ombrotrophic bog, but were numerous only in the surface peat of minerotrophic fen. Deeper layers of the fen had only small numbers of testate amoebae. Decomposition of organic material is generally greater at the fen site and has been accelerated during the drainage phase in the bog site, presumably with effects on the occurrence of testacean shells.
   Moisture conditions and peat composition were the main factors determining the occurrence of testaceans. In this study the pH of both mires was low and thus all the species were adapted to acidic conditions. Further, certain species showed correlation with mineral elements of the peat. The species that indicated dry conditions in the bog disappeared or their numbers decreased after the restoration. The effect of the moisture gradient was not as clear as before the restoration, and the testacean species seemed to be more dispersed according to the variation in mineral elements.

AB We present a record of peatland development during the last 1000 years from Mauntschas mire in the eastern Swiss Alps (Upper Engadine valley; 1818 m a.s.l.) inferred from testate amoebae (pH and depth to the water table (DWT) reconstructions), stable oxygen isotopes in Sphagnum (delta O-18; proxy for water vapour pressure) and carbon isotopes in Sphagnum (delta C-13; proxy for mire surface wetness), peat accumulation rates, charcoal (indicating local burning), pollen and spores (proxies for human impact), and plant macrofossils (reflecting local vegetation and trophic state). Past human impact on the local mire conditions was strong but fluctuating during AD 1000-1570 (+/- 50 yr; depth-age model based on 29 C-14 AMS dates) with local irrigation of nutrient-enriched water and grazing. Human impact was minor AD 1570-1830 (+/- 30 yr) with partial recovery of the local mire vegetation, and it was absent AD 1830 (+/- 30 yr)-present when hummock formation took place. Correlations among DWT, pH, delta C-13, and delta O-18, carried out both with the raw data and with linear trends removed, suggest that the factors driving peatland development changed over time, since only testate amoeba-based pH and DWT co-varied during all the three aforementioned periods. delta O-18 correlates with delta C-13 only in the period AD 1830-present and with DWT only during AD 1570-1830, delta C-13 correlates with DWT only during AD 1000-1570. Part of this apparent instability among the four time series might be attributed to shifts in the local mire conditions which potentially formed very different (non-analogue) habitats. Lack of analogues, caused, for example, by pre-industrial human impact, might have introduced artefacts in the reconstructions, since those habitats are not well represented in some proxy transfer functions. Human impact was probably the main factor for peatland development, distorting most of the climate signals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Northern peatlands are projected to be crucial in future atmospheric methane (CH4) budgets and have a positive feedback on global warming. Fens receive nutrients from catchments via inflowing water and are more sensitive than bogs to variations in their ecohydrology. Yet, due to a lack of data detailing the impacts of moving water on microhabitats and CH4 fluxes in fens, large uncertainties remain with respect to predicting CH4 emissions from these sites under climate changes. We measured CH4 fluxes with manual chambers over three growing seasons (2017-2019) at a northern boreal fen. To address the spatial variation at the site where a stream flows through the long and narrow valley fen, we established sample plots at varying distances from the stream. To link the variations in CH4 emissions to environmental controls, we quantified water levels, peat temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, vegetation composition, and leaf area index in combination with flux measurements during the growing season in 2019. We found that due to the flowing water, there was a higher water level, cooler peat temperatures, and more oxygen in the peat close to the stream, which also had the highest total leaf area and gross primary production (GPP) values but the lowest CH4 emissions. CH4 emissions were highest at an intermediate distance from the stream where the oxygen concentration in the surface peat was low but GPP was still high. Further from the stream, the conditions were drier and produced low CH4 emissions. Our results emphasize the key role of ecohydrology in CH4 dynamics in fens and, for the first time, show how a stream controls CH4 emissions in a flow-through fen. As valley fens are common peatland ecosystems from the Arctic to the temperate zones, future projections of global CH4 budgets need to take flowing water features into account.

AB The south-eastern part of the Bohemian Massif (the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands, the Trebon basin, Czech Republic) is an important hotspot of fen biodiversity. Especially rich fens with calcium-tolerant peat mosses (the Sphagno warnstoifii-Tomentypnion alliance) currently harbour highly endangered organisms. In this study we gathered phytosociological and environmental (water chemistry, water table depth) data from 57 unique and well-preserved fens. The ISOPAM algorithm reproduced the expert-based classification at the alliance level presented in the Vegetation of the Czech Republic monograph. Particular types of vegetation were nearly completely differentiated in the PCA of environmental data and all their pairs differed significantly with respect to pH, which together with calcium was correlated with the major vegetation gradient. The secondary gradient coincided with the concentration of nitrate and potassium, but was not apparent in the bryophyte subset. When only data for vascular plants were analyzed, the major gradient reflected increasing number of species from poor to extremely-rich fens, including ubiquitous grassland species, and only partially coincided with pH and calcium. Contrary to expectations, neither the extremely rich or rich fens were associated with low concentration phosphorus in the water. In addition, particular vegetation types did not differ in the N:P ratio of bryophyte biomass. Species composition of extremely rich fens thus seemed to be determined predominantly by a high pH/calcium level and waterlogging, low iron concentration and absence of sphagna that would hamper regeneration of some competitively weak vascular plants. We demonstrated that the delimitation of the major vegetation types (alliances) along the poor-rich gradient makes great floristic and ecological sense also in the Hercynian Mountains and that pH and calcium rather than nutrient availability differentiate causally major vegetation types by determining structure of the moss layer.

AB A valley mire was sampled on the flanks of Swampy Hill, east Otago, New Zealand. It formed in a narrow valley, apparently originally comprising two basins. The end of the mire nearest the outlet contained species typical of fens (i.e., rheotrophic mires). At the head of the valley there was a section of the mire with mixed vegetation cover comprising the tussock grass Chionochloa rubra, Sphagnum species, and cushion/herb/shrub cover. Ombrotrophic status of this section was indicated by a slightly raised profile, greater acidity, lower exchangeable Na and K, and lower substrate cation exchange capacity, identifying it as a bog. Total Ca:Mg molar ratios were generally above 1.0, but this rule-of-thumb for ombrotrophic status may be inapplicable here. It is not known whether New Zealand Sphagnum species are as efficient at lowering the pH as those investigated elsewhere. Macrofosssil evidence indicates that some components of the bog, such as Sphagnum and epacridaceous subshrubs, have remained constant, almost since the inception of the bog. However, Empodisma minus, currently absent from the bog and rare in the region, was present at one stage. The change from cover with Empodisma and Dracophyllum as significant components, to the present Chionochloa/Sphagnum/cushion composition, occurred a few hundred years ago, probably initiated by fire. Comparison with preliminary information for other bogs suggests that those in the eastern part of the South Island vary considerably in species composition, with individualistic assemblages of species. The site is seen as having high conservation values. To protect these values the bog needs protection from invasive exotic weeds, and from damage by wild pigs.

AB Background and aims Estimation of root-mediated carbon fluxes in forested peatlands is needed for understanding ecosystem functioning and supporting greenhouse gas inventories. Here, we aim to determine the optimal methodology for utilizing ingrowth cores in estimating annual fine-root production (FRP) and its vertical distribution in trees, shrubs and herbs.
   Methods We used 3-year data obtained with modified ingrowth core method and tested two calculation methods: 'ingrowth-dividing' and `ingrowth-subtracting'.
   Results The ingrowth-dividing method combined with a 2-year incubation of ingrowth cores can be used for the 'best estimate' of FRP. The FRP in the nutrient-rich fen forest (561 g m(-2)) was more than twice that in the nutrient-poor bog forest (244 g m(-2)). Most FRP occurred in the top 20-cm layer (76-82 %). Tree FRP accounted for 71 % of total FRP in the bog and 94 % in the fen forests, respectively, following the aboveground vegetation patterns; however, in fen forest the proportions of spruce and birch in FRP were higher than their proportions in stand basal area.
   Conclusions Our methodology may be used to study peatland FRP patterns more widely and will reduce the volume of labour-intensive work, but will benefit from verification with other methods, as is the case in all in situ FRP studies.

AB Raised bogs dominated by the vegetation association Ledo-Sphagnetum magellanici Sukopp 1959 em. Neuhausl 1969 are a valuable and ecologically important plant community that occurs in Central Europe. They develop in impervious depressions with precipitation as the only water source, and are particularly sensitive to drainage, climate change, eutrophication and overgrowing by trees and shrubs. The high pressure of threat justifies taking protective measures. This research focused on the effects of the removal of birch from two bogs, which were dominated by two birch species (Betula pubescens, B. pendula) and also included stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris); the bogs are located in northeastern Poland and showed signs of drying. The trees were removed in early spring 2008. To capture the response to tree cutting, vegetation monitoring was performed for 7 years. The results were compared to pre-cutting environmental conditions (precipitation, temperature, air transpiration). At the first site, which was drained at the beginning of the twentieth century, the ground water level initially decreased; then, from 2010 onwards, the level stabilised and exhibited a negative correlation with the average annual air temperature. While the second site exhibited no significant differences in the ground water table, a correlation with the average annual rainfall was found. At both sites, there was an increase in the coverage of species appropriate for raised bogs, Oxycocco-Sphagnatea Br.-Bl. et R. Tx. 1943, whereas only the second site had significant coverage of these species. These actions improved the habitat conditions and initiated the process of raised bog restoration at that site because Oxycocco-Sphagnatea species cover and frequency increased.

AB Peat accumulating mires are important sources of the greenhouse gas methane. Methane emissions and methanogenic Archaea communities have been shown to differ between fens and bogs, implying that mire succession includes an ecological succession in methanogen communities. We investigated methane production and the methanogen communities along a chronosequence of mires (ca. 100-2500 years), which consisted of five sites (1-5) located on the land-uplift coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. Methane production was measured in a laboratory incubation experiment. Methanogen communities were determined by amplification of a methyl coenzyme M-reductase (mcr) gene marker and analyzed by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting resulted in 15 terminal restriction fragments. The ordination configuration of the terminal restriction fragments data, using nonmetric multidimensional scaling, showed a clear gradient in the methanogen community structure along the mire chronosequence. In addition, fingerprint patterns of samples from the water table level and 40 cm below differed from one another in the bog site (site 5). Methane production was negligible in the three youngest fen sites (sites 1-3) and showed the highest rates in the oligotrophic fen site (site 4). Successful PCR amplification using mcr gene primers revealed the presence of a methanogen community in all five sites along the study transect.

AB Peat samples collected in six peatlands located in north-eastern Poland were analysed. Two of the investigated peatlands were fens, two were transitional bogs and two of them were raised bogs. All peat deposits were investigated in the whole stratigraphic profile, and peat samples were chosen according to the differentiation of peat genus in deposit. pH in water and KCI, degree of decomposition, ash content, carbon content as well as the ratio of humic to fulvic acid were evaluated. The highest degree of peat decomposition was found in wood peat (Alneti), and the in moss peat (Bryaleti). The strongest humification was observed in low peat of genus Limno-Phragmitioni (hypnum-moss peat) and Magnocaricioni (sedgeous peat).

AB New pollen and plant macrofossil evidence from the Polistovo-Lovatskaya Mire System is presented. The results show that local vegetation of the mire system was affected by various factors such as climate, hydrogeology and autochthonous processes in the peat bog. An important palaeoecological event took place around 6500 cal BP and led to a dramatic increase of paludification processes and lateral expansion of the mire. Forests of spruce and broad-leaved species in various combinations represented primary vegetation of uplands; they began to degrade around 1500 years ago and disappeared in historical times (400-500 cal BP). First signs of arable farming in the area occurred around 4200 cal BP, regular and mild human pressure established about 1000 years cal BP, and a significant impact at the regional level became evident around 400 years ago.

AB The Baltic coast of Northern Poland is an interesting region for palaeoclimatic studies because of the mixed oceanic and continental climatic influences and the fact that the dominance of one or the other of these two influences might have changed over time. Also, unlike many more intensively studied regions of Europe, human impact in the region was rather limited until the 19th century. We present a 1200-year high-resolution record from Stazki mire, an ombrotrophic bog located 35 km from the Baltic Sea coast. Using testate amoebae, stable isotopes (delta C-13) of Sphagnum stems, pollen, plant macrofossils and dendroecological analyses, our aims were to: 1) reconstruct the last millennium palaeoenvironment in the study site and its surroundings, 2) identify the major wet-dry shifts, 3) determine if those events correlate with climate change and human impact, 4) assess the resilience of the Baltic bog ecosystem following human impact, and 5) compare the palaeo-moisture signal from the Baltic coast with records from more oceanic regions. Two dry periods are inferred at AD 1100-1500 and 1650-1900 (-2005). The first dry shift is probably climate-driven as pollen record shows little evidence of human indicators. The second dry shift can be related to local peat exploitation of the mire. In the 20th century additional limited drainage took place and since ca. AD 1950 the mire has been recovering. From 1500 AD onwards all proxies indicate wetter condition. The beginning of this wet shift occurred during the Little Ice Age and may therefore be a climatic signal. The macrofossil data show that Sphagnum fuscum dominated the pristine mire vegetation but then declined and finally disappeared at ca. AD 1900. This pattern is comparable with the timing of extinction of Sphagnum austinii (-Sphagnum imbricatum) in the UK. This study illustrates the value of high-resolution multi-proxy studies of peat archives to assess the magnitude of anthropogenic land-use changes. This study presents the first direct comparison of testate amoebae and stable isotope data from the same core. The two proxies correlate significantly throughout the record and most strongly for the latter part of the record when most of the variability was recorded. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB 1 British and world distribution patterns of the moss Racomitrium lanuginosum (Hedw.) Brid. are used to deduce the likely conditions governing the occurrence of its preserved leaves in the upper layers of British blanket peats. It is suggested that R. lanuginosum dominates in blanket mires only under conditions of lowered water table and high atmospheric humidity.
   2 Detailed stratigraphic records from blanket mires in the Southern Pennines (Northern England) and the Berwyn Mountains (North Wales) show remains of R. lanuginosum preserved in the peat columns of both eroded and uneroded sites. At uneroded sites in the Southern Pennines, Racomitrium remains predominate between about AD 1250 and 1450 and again in the mid-Eighteenth Century. At hummock sites in both regions, and at gullied sites in the Southern Pennines, Racomitrium remains are continuously present in the peat column from about AD 1250-1800.
   3 It is concluded that the presence of Racomitrium remains in the peat column constitutes a clear proxy-climate signal, signifying, in uneroded areas, a prolonged period of drier climate succeeded by a return to a wetter, more humid climate (though that signal may be blurred by superimposed effects of burning and grazing of the mire surface).
   4 The macrofossil record demonstrates the marked effects on the blanket mire vegetation of both study regions of the documented period of drier climate from c. AD 1115-1300 (the 'Early Mediaeval Warm Period').
   5 Possible consequences of that episode on the blanket mires of the two regions include the onset of gully erosion and the development of a 'stagnation complex' in pool-and-hummock systems. The extension of these findings to other blanket mire regions of the British Isles is discussed.

AB A large proportion of northern peatlands consists of Sphagnum-dominated ombrotrophic bogs. In these bogs, peat mosses (Sphagnum) and vascular plants occur in an apparent stable equilibrium, thereby sustaining the carbon sink function of the bog ecosystem. How global warming and increased nitrogen (N) deposition will affect the species composition in bog vegetation is still unclear. We performed a transplantation experiment in which mesocosms with intact vegetation were transplanted southward from north Sweden to north-east Germany along a transect of four bog sites, in which both temperature and N deposition increased. In addition, we monitored undisturbed vegetation in control plots at the four sites of the latitudinal gradient. Four growing seasons after transplantation, ericaceous dwarf shrubs had become much more abundant when transplanted to the warmest site which also had highest N deposition. As a result ericoid aboveground biomass in the transplanted mesocosms increased most at the southernmost site, this site also had highest ericoid biomass in the undisturbed vegetation. The two dominant Sphagnum species showed opposing responses when transplanted southward; Sphagnum balticum height increment decreased, whereas S. fuscum height increment increased when transplanted southward. Sphagnum production did not differ significantly among the transplanted mesocosms, but was lowest in the southernmost control plots. The dwarf shrub expansion and increased N concentrations in plant tissues we observed, point in the direction of a positive feedback toward vascular plant-dominance suppressing peat-forming Sphagnum in the long term. However, our data also indicate that precipitation and phosphorus availability influence the competitive balance between Sphagnum, dwarf shrubs and graminoids.

AB Peatlands are valuable but threatened ecosystems. Intervention to tackle direct threats is often necessary, but should be informed by scientific evidence to ensure it is effective and efficient. Here we discuss a recent synthesis of evidence for the effects of interventions to conserve peatland vegetation - a fundamental component of healthy, functioning peatland ecosystems. The synthesis is unique in its broad scope (global evidence for a comprehensive list of 125 interventions) and practitioner-focused outputs (short narrative summaries in plain English, integrated into a searchable online database). Systematic literature searches, supplemented by recommendations from an international advisory board, identified 162 publications containing 296 distinct tests of 66 of the interventions. Most of the articles studied open bogs or fens in Europe or North America. Only 36 interventions were supported by sufficient evidence to assess their overall effectiveness. Most of these interventions (85 %) had positive effects, overall, on peatland vegetation although this figure is likely to have been inflated by publication bias. We discuss how to use the synthesis, critically, to inform conservation decisions. Reflecting on the content of the synthesis we make suggestions for the future of peatland conservation, from monitoring over appropriate timeframes to routinely publishing results to build up the evidence base.

AB Many high-elevation wetlands have been degraded by activities related to the skiing industry. However, few studies exist on their restoration in this harsh environment. From 2010 to 2017, we set up an experiment on a degraded bog located at 2500 m within the ski resort of Val-Thorens (France). We tested (1) if transplanting two sedge species, Trichophorum cespitosum and Eriophorum scheuchzeri effectively helped to initiate the restoration of the bog vegetation and (2) if different planting combinations of the species under different mulch treatments affected transplant survival and cover. After stabilising the bare peat with wood fascines and installed weirs in the incised gully that drained the bog, we planted tussocks of T. cespitosum and ramets of E. scheuchzeri, each alone or in mixture. We used straw mulch or a "biomulch" made of live shoots of Polytrichum moss. After a slight increase the first 2 years, the number of E. scheuchzeri ramets decreased continuously in all treatments and reached zero in 2016. T. cespitosum had a low mortality in all treatments; its annual survival rate and cover were significantly higher with biomulch. Because of strong winds and snow action, all the straw was removed after 2 years while the biomulch cover remained between 10 and 25% from the third to the fifth year then was close to zero from 2016. Nevertheless, this low cover seemed sufficient to favour the survival and growth of T. cespitosum. In 2017, bare soil was lower in all treatments with biomulch and T. cespitosum. This treatment appears to be the best restoration option, but it is likely that more than 7 to 10 years will be required to establish adequate plant cover at degraded high-elevation sites.

AB Peatlands provide important ecosystem services including carbon storage and biodiversity conservation. Remote sensing shows potential for monitoring peatlands, but most off-the-shelf data products are developed for unsaturated environments and it is unclear how well they can perform in peatland ecosystems. Sphagnum moss is an important peatland genus with specific characteristics which can affect spectral reflectance, and we hypothesized that the prevalence of Sphagnum in a peatland could affect the spectral signature of the area. This article combines results from both laboratory and field experiments to assess the relationship between spectral indices and the moisture content and gross primary productivity (GPP) of peatland (blanket bog) vegetation species. The aim was to consider how well the selected indices perform under a range of conditions, and whether Sphagnum has a significant impact on the relationships tested. We found that both water indices tested [normalized difference water index (NDWI) and floating water band index (fWBI)] were sensitive to the water content changes in Sphagnum moss in the laboratory, and there was little difference between them. Most of the vegetation indices tested [the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), structure insensitive pigment index (SIPI), and chlorophyll index (CIm)] were found to have a strong relationship with GPP both in the laboratory and in the field. The NDVI and EVI are useful for large-scale estimation of GPP, but are sensitive to the proportion of Sphagnum present. The CIm is less affected by different species proportions and might therefore be the best to use in areas where vegetation species cover is unknown. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) is shown to be best suited to small-scale studies of single species.

AB The moss Racomitrium lanuginosum (Hedw.) Brid. is widely distributed in the cool-oceanic north and west of the British Isles, where it is an important element in the vegetation of blanket mire. It has been described as occurring on the present-day surface of British blanket mire in two situations (i.e. where the local mire water table may be lowered, despite high atmospheric humidity), on the tops of tall hummocks and adjacent to areas of peat erosion, where it may be dominant in the vegetation. Accordingly, the occurrence of R. lanuginosum is widely perceived as indicative of drier mire conditions and/or mire degradation. In contrast, recent palaeoecological studies have documented the recurrence of R. lanuginosum in the absence of either hummock upgrowth or peat erosion. Such studies suggest that R. lanuginosum may also occur on blanket mire as a component of climatically-mediated mire development. This paper presents critical new data to document the decomposition of R. lanuginosum and describes the results of recent palaeoecological studies that have negated the exclusive role of R. lanuginosum in mire drying/degradation. We present evidence for the active role of R. lanuginosum in persistent blanket mire development, suggesting the moss may occur during periods of climate change towards increased wetness, after a sustained period of drier conditions. The results are of wider relevance in evidencing the sensitivity of oceanic blanket mire to past climate change.

AB Macrofossil analyses were used to reconstruct long-term vegetation successions within ombrotrophic peatlands (bogs) from the northern shorelines of the St. Lawrence Estuary (Baie-Comeau) and the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Havre-St-Pierre). Over the Holocene, the timing and the ecological context of peatland inception were similar in both regions and were mainly influenced by fluctuations in relative sea level. Peat accumulation started over deltaic sands after the withdrawal of the Goldthwait Sea from 7500 cal yr BP and above silt-clay deposits left by the Laurentian marine transgression after 4200 cal yr BP. In each region, the early vegetation communities were similar within these two edaphic contexts where poor fens with Cyperaceae and eastern larch (Larix laricina) established after land emergence. The rapid transitions to ombrotrophy in the peatlands of Baie-Comeau are associated with particularly high rates of peat accumulation during the early developmental stage. The results suggest that climate was more propitious to Sphagnum growth after land emergence in the Baie-Comeau area. Macrofossil data show that treeless Sphagnum-dominated bogs have persisted over millennia and that fires had few impacts on the vegetation dynamics. This study provides insight into peatland vegetation responses to climate in a poorly documented region of northeastern America. (C) 2014 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Despite existing management agreements, significant change has occurred on Carnwath Moss and Coladoir Bog, two mire complexes in central and western Scotland. Spontaneous succession has accelerated, resulting in extensive degradation of the mire vegetation on both bites and, in particular, widespread expansion of Calluna vulgaris- and Molinia caerulea-dominated vegetation types. Vegetation surveys across strong gradients of change were conducted with the aim of quantifying the extent of early (desirable) and late (undesirable) successional vegetation on both sites. For each site multivariate analyses of the vegetation data were carried out using TWINSPAN, which clearly differentiated higher quality and degraded surfaces. In management terms percentage Sphagnum cover can act as a useful proxy measure of water level and shrub layer height can also serve as a useful indicator of the degree of degradation. A broad-based, five class condition continuum was developed for the Carnwath Moss site. While such an assessment scheme is a somewhat arbitrary means of allocating mesotope areas to specific condition classes, it is rapid to apply and simple enough to be applied by a range of users. A drawback is that the methodology is data-light in temporal terms and is not a long-term substitute for properly-funded monitoring programmes for important sites. For both mires, recommendations are made for management with the main emphasis being on maintaining water tables at appropriate levels to maximise the floristic diversity of active mires.

AB Surface water chemistry was monitored in three fens through one growing season by weekly sampling in the southern aapa mire zone, middle boreal Finland. The fens included a soligenous moderately rich fen, a soligenous extremely poor fen, and a topogenous extremely poor fen. The chemical variables most clearly related to the poor-rich gradient were pH, alkalinity, Ca, Mg, and Na concentrations. The soligenous and topogenous extremely poor fens differed in DOC, Al, Fe, Si, and S concentrations. The main chemical gradients were related to the season. In early summer (June to July) the chemical gradients were variable and weakly definable. In late summer (August to September) the gradients were more stable and separated the three fens clearly. Late summer is suggested optimal for comparable sampling of surface water in boreal fens.

AB While considerable attention has been given to the measurement of mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) concentrations and accumulation in detailed peat cores in central Canada, the geographic distribution and density of sampling are generally limited. Here, we use the Ontario Peatland Inventory to examine broad patterns of Hg and Pb concentration with depth, based on 338 peat cores (containing > 1500 analyzed samples) from 127 bogs, fens and swamps located in southeastern, northeastern and northwestern sections of Ontario. Overall, Hg concentrations averaged 0.05 mu g g(-1) and that of Pb averaged 10.8 mu g g(-1). Maximum values in the top 50 cm of the profiles are 0.08 mu g g(-1) and 26.2 mu g g(-1) for Hg and Pb, respectively. The ratio between these values (surface) and the values from below 100 cm (background), where peat likely accumulated before 1850 and industrial activities were limited, are 23 and 6.6 for Hg and Pb, respectively. The highest surface:background concentration ratios are generally found in the westernmost part of the province and in the southeast for Hg and around areas that are more heavily populated for Pb. Our results show that a vast amount of Hg and Pb are stored in Ontarian peatlands, although the spatial distribution of these stores varies. The rapid decomposition of peat in a changing climate could release these pollutants to the atmosphere. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many areas of blanket mire in Britain display apparently degraded vegetation, having a limited range of ericaceous and Sphagnum species. Data are presented here from Wales from the upland locality of Drygarn Fawr (Elenydd SSSI), which is dominated overwhelmingly by Molinia caerulea. Palaeoecological techniques were used to chronicle vegetation history and to determine the nature and timing of vegetation changes, as an aid to devising conservation management and restoration strategies. Although for the past 2000 years the pollen and plant macrofossil data indicate some evidence for cyclic vegetation change, they demonstrate that here the major vegetation change post-dated the start of the industrial revolution. The palaeoecological data show a greater proportion of Sphagnum than currently. Local extinction of some species (e.g., Myrica gale) apparently took place in Medieval times, but most of the degradation and floral impoverishment apparently occurred during the 20th Century. The implications for conservation management are far-reaching. The overwhelming dominance of Molinia is clearly unprecedented. While it was locally present for hundreds of years, some factor(s)-possibly a change in grazer and grazing regime-encouraged its recent ascendancy in the 20th Century. Consequently, any management attempts to reduce the pre-eminence of Molinia would not be countering an ingrained, long-established dominance. It is suggested that investigation of degraded blanket mires elsewhere by historical and multi-proxy palaeoecological techniques-through multiple, dated cores to track species extinctions and directional vegetation changes-would help ascertain previous mire floras and so indicate a range of restoration targets for mire vegetation.

AB This study investigated how hydrogeological setting influences aquifer-peatland connections in slope and basin peatlands. Steady-state groundwater flow was simulated using Modflow on 2D transects for an esker slope peatland and for a basin peatland in southern Quebec (Canada). Simulations investigated how hydraulic heads and groundwater flow exported toward runoff from the peatland can be influenced by recharge, hydraulic properties, and heterogeneity. The slope peatland model was strongly dominated by horizontal flow from the esker. This suggests that slope peatlands are dependent on the hydrogeological conditions of the adjacent aquifer reservoir, but are resilient to hydrological changes. The basin peatland produced groundwater outflow to the surface aquifer. Lateral and vertical peat heterogeneity due to peat decomposition or compaction were identified as having a significant influence on fluxes. These results suggest that basin peatlands are more dependent on recharge conditions, and could be more susceptible to land use and climate changes.

AB Young coastal fens are rare ecosystems in the first stages of peatland succession. Their drainage compromises their successional development toward future carbon (C) reservoirs. We present the first study on the success of hydrological restoration of young fens. We carried out vegetation surveys at six young fens that represent undrained, drained, and restored management categories in the Finnish land uplift coast before and after restoration. We measured plant level carbon dioxide (CO2) assimilation and chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) from 17 most common plant species present at the sites. Within 5 years of restoration, the vegetation composition of restored sites had started to move toward the undrained baseline. The cover of sedges increased the most in response to restoration, while the cover of deciduous shrubs decreased the most. The rapid response indicates high resilience and low resistance of young fen ecosystems toward changes in hydrology. Forbs had higher photosynthetic and respiration rates than sedges, deciduous shrubs, and grasses, whereas rates were lowest for evergreen shrubs and mosses. The impact of management category on CO2 assimilation was an indirect consequence that occurred through changes in plant species composition: Increase in sedge cover following restoration also increased the potential photosynthetic capacity of the ecosystem. Synthesis and applications. Restoration of forestry drained young fens is a promising method for safeguarding them and bringing back their function as C reservoirs. However, their low resistance to water table draw down introduces a risk that regeneration may be partially hindered by the heavy drainage in the surrounding landscape. Therefore, restoration success is best safeguarded by managing the whole catchments instead of carrying out small-scale projects.

AB The large accumulation of carbon in peatlands arises from slow organic matter decomposition where microorganisms and their enzyme activities play a critical role. However, there is a dearth of studies on the natural patterns of peatland microbial enzyme activity and inhibitory phenolic compounds over seasons, and across a range of depths and biogeochemically different peatland types. We report the spatiotemporal patterns for phenol oxidases, phenolics, and a suite of five key hydrolase enzymes at two depths in two ombrotrophic bogs, mineral poor and rich fens, and a forested basin swamp over the growing season. Results obtained using linear fixed and mixed effect models suggest that phenol oxidase activity varies significantly with temperature and, to a lesser extent pH, leading to a breakdown of inhibitory phenolics and increased hydrolase enzyme activity across all peatland types. Overall, enzyme activity decreased significantly with depth and showed significant variation over the course of the growing season with a minimum in the spring and a maximum in the summer and fall. Enzyme activities were generally greatest in the rich fen and lowest in the forested basin swamp with no significant difference between bogs and poor fens. Site-specific factors such as nutrient availability explain deviations from these patterns. Our results illustrate the widespread but conditional applicability of the enzyme latch mechanism to peatlands and the vulnerability of the peatland soil organic carbon stock to climate warming.

AB Although ombrotrophic peatlands are nutrient deficient, it is not clear to what extent plants will respond to changes in nutrient availability.
   We examined the changes in foliar stoichiometry and species abundance of four shrub species and moss after a decade of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilization at the Mer Bleue bog, eastern Canada.
   Shrub abundance increased and moss cover decreased after fertilization with 6.4, 5 and 6.3 g m(-2) yr(-1) of N, P and K, respectively; foliar concentrations of N, P, K and calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) were affected. Stoichiometry showed mainly N limitation after P and K fertilization and P (co)limitation after high levels of N addition in shrubs; moss showed consistent K or KN-co-limitation, even with PK and NPK additions. Shrubs exhibited the strongest homeostasis (the maintenance of an organism's tissue chemical composition with changes in environmental resources) to N, with the homeostatic regulation coefficient (H) > 9.7, compared to 1.4 in moss. For P and K, shrubs showed weaker homeostasis than N, while moss had a stronger homeostasis.
   The strong homeostasis of shrubs may be an adaptive strategy to limited availability of soil N and P.

TI Evolution of the vegetation in the southern part of the fagne Wallonne
   raised bog, during the last 60 years (Hautes-Fagnes, Belgium)
SO BELGIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
LA French
DT Article
AB Less than 500 years ago, raised bogs covered over 1000 ha on the Hautes-Fagnes plateau. Today, only +/- 125 ha of ombrotrophic little disturbed raised bogs remain. Recent studies have proved that these remnants show evidences of typical peat-forming communities regression.
   The aim of this study is to follow the vegetation dynamic of the southern part of the fagne Wallonne raised bog, by comparison of old and recent vegetation transects made in 1938, 1957 and 1995 and to detect in it some possible signs of evolution or regression.
   The vegetation has been mapped at 1:10 scale and qualitatively surveyed on 4 m(2) plots each 20 m along the transect. The cover degree of each species has been estimated. The results show a large reduction of the cover degree of Sphagnum species, an almost disappearance of the "Schlenken" and an increase of heathland species.
   These results are compared with the observations for the northern and the central zones (HINDRYCKX 1989). The damage to the typical raised bog vegetation is very clear and important in the northern part of the bog: disappearance of typical species overgrown by Molinia caerulea. In the central and the southern parts, the increasing cover degree of ericaceous plants indicates clearly that the peat forming activity is strongly slowed down.

AB The Archaea represent a significant component of the plant microbiome, whereas their function is still unclear. Different plant species representing the natural vegetation of alpine bogs harbor a substantial archaeal community originating from five phyla, 60 genera, and 334 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). We identified a core archaeome for all bog plants and ecosystem-specific, so far unclassified Archaea. In the metagenomic data set, Archaea were found to have the potential to interact with plants by (i) possible plant growth promotion through auxin biosynthesis, (ii) nutrient supply, and (iii) protection against abiotic (especially oxidative and osmotic) stress. The unexpectedly high degree of plant specificity supports plantarchaeon interactions. Moreover, functional signatures of Archaea reveal genetic capacity for the interplay with fungi and an important role in the carbon and nitrogen cycle: e.g., CO2 and N-2 fixation. These facts reveal an important, yet unobserved role of the Archaea for plants as well as for the bog ecosystem.
   IMPORTANCE Archaea are still an underdetected and little-studied part of the plant microbiome. We provide first and novel insights into Archaea as a functional component of the plant microbiome obtained by metagenomic analyses. Archaea were found to have the potential to interact with plants by (i) plant growth promotion through auxin biosynthesis, (ii) nutrient supply, and (iii) protection against abiotic stress.

AB We studied the effects of restoration on water-table depth (WTD), element concentrations of peat and vegetation composition of peatlands drained for forestry in southern Finland. The restoration aimed to return the trajectory of vegetation succession toward that of undisturbed systems through the blockage of ditches and the removal of trees. Permanent plots established on a bog and a fen were sampled 1 year before, and 1, 2, 3, and 10 years after the restoration. The restoration resulted in a long-term rise of the water-table in both peatlands. Ten years after restoration, the mineral element concentrations (Ca, K, Mg, Mn, and P) of peat corresponded to those reported from comparable pristine peatlands. In particular, the increase of K and Mn concentrations at both sites suggests the recovery of ecosystem functionality in terms of nutrient cycling between peat and plants. The restoration resulted in the succession of plant communities toward the targeted peatland vegetation of wetter condition at both sites. This was evident from the decreased abundance of species benefiting from drainage and the corresponding increase of peatland species. However, many species typical of pristine peatlands were missing 10 years after restoration. We conclude that the restoration led to a reversal of the effects of drainage in vegetation and studied habitat conditions. However, due to the slow recovery of peatland ecosystems and the possibility that certain failures in the restoration measures may become apparent only after extended time periods, long-term monitoring is needed to determine whether the goals of restoration will be met.

AB Ecological patterns of mollusc assemblages and vegetation in relation to water chemistry, water regime, nutrient availability and climate were studied in eastern Polish lowland fens. Our goal was to examine if major compositional changes differ for molluscs and vegetation under the joint influence of multiple ecological gradients. Altogether 32 fen sites were investigated in 2010-2011, and analyzed using metric multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis and generalized additive models. Two major gradients driving the differences in mollusc species composition were revealed. The main direction of compositional changes was associated with the water table gradient, governing a species turnover from inundated and strongly water-logged sites occupied mostly by aquatic mollusc species, to moderately wet sites with the predominance of fen and meadow species. The second most important gradient for molluscs was that of mineral richness. For vegetation, three major gradients explained the changes in species composition. The highest importance was assigned to the nitrogen-to-phosphorus availability gradient (defined as a shift from N-limited to P-limited vegetation), followed by the water table gradient, and the mineral richness gradient. Our results demonstrate that the impact of mineral richness gradient, which has been often reported as the major determinant of compositional changes of fen molluscs and vegetation, can be exceeded by other ecological gradients of comparable variation. We also document for the first time that the main species turnover of fen vegetation is not accompanied by the analogous change in species composition of mollusc assemblages, due to a different sensitivity of these taxa to particular environmental factors (i.e. water level dynamics and type of nutrient limitation).

AB Question Can UAV-based NIR remote sensing support restoration monitoring of cut-over bogs by providing valid information on species distribution and surface structure? Location Restored polders of the Uchter Moor, a bog complex in NW Germany. Methods We used autonomously flying quadrocopters, supplied with either a panchromatic or colour infrared calibrated small frame digital camera to generate high resolution images of the restored bog surface. We performed a two-step classification process of automatic image segmentation and object-based classification to distinguish between four pre-defined classes (waterlogged bare peat, Sphagnum spp., Eriophorum vaginatum and Betula pubescens. An independent validation procedure was performed to evaluate the accuracy of the classification. Results A set-up composed of decision rules for reflectance, geometry and textural features was applied for identification of the four classes. The presented classification revealed an overall accuracy level of 91%. Most reliable attribution was obtained for waterlogged bare peat and Sphagnum-covered surfaces, revealing producer accuracies of 95% and 91%, respectively. Lower but still feasible accuracy levels were obtained for Eriophorum vaginatum and Betula pubescens individuals (89% and 84%, respectively). Conclusions UAV-based NIR remote sensing is a promising tool for monitoring the restoration of cut-over bogs and has the potential to significantly reduce laborious field surveys. UAVs may increasingly play a significant role in future ecological monitoring studies, since they are small in size, highly flexible, easy to handle, non-emissive and available at a comparatively low cost.

AB Changes in vegetation composition due to nitrogen deposition may influence the role of peatlands in the carbon cycle. The impact of nitrogen (N) on vegetation composition of the Mer Bleue Bog (Ontario) and the underlying mechanisms were studied using a coupled carbon (C) and nitrogen wetland model (PEATBOG). The model was applied to data from a long-term nutrient fertilization experiment and the results were compared with the observed C and N pools in plants, peat, and soil water after 8 years of fertilization with 1.6, 3.2, and 6.4 gN m(-2) y(-1) and additional phosphorus and potassium. The evaluated model was employed to simulate the vegetation dynamics in the peatland fertilized with different loads and concentrations of N. The model suggested a shift in plant functional types from moss-shrub dominated to graminoid dominated with increasing N load. Suppression of mosses by N fertilization was mitigated by daily deposition of N at a low concentration. Mosses became extinct in the simulations only when the concentration and load of N deposition were high, corroborating empirical results from the fertilization experiment. Tracking the deposited N in the system, the model indicated that it was primarily sequestered in the peat. Dissolved N concentrations in peat and export from the bog increased with N load and decreased with N concentration, leading to higher N uptake by vascular plants. The results further suggested that the observed detrimental effect of N on mosses was most likely due to toxicity caused by N uptake exceeding N assimilation. Exposure of mosses to high N concentrations in precipitation and evaporating water on moss tissues is thus a factor that needs attention when considering critical loads of N deposition on peatlands.

These rich fens were used for traditional hay cutting until ca. 1950. Three management regimes are used: 1) biennial mowing, 2) quadrennial mowing and 3) unmown. The unmown areas were traditional hay fens, with no management since the 1950s. Of the 89 plant taxa and corresponding 65 taxa of pollen and spores, 29 and 22, respectively, were sufficiently represented in both vegetation and as pollen, to allow direct comparisons of the two data sets. Most of the plant and pollen taxa were found in the plots from both study areas and in plots with different mowing frequencies. Therefore, quantitative differences in vegetation cover and pollen percentages were the main focus in this investigation of plant-pollen relationships in mown and unmown vegetation. The relative difference in plant cover was largest between biennially and unmown plots. 12 species showed a significant positive correlation with difference in plant cover between mown and unmown areas (p < 0.05; Wilcoxon signed rank test), most pronounced for Molinia caerulea (most common in unmown plots), and Carex dioica and Thalictrum alpinum (most common in mown plots). A significant positive plant-pollen correlation (Spearman rank-correlation) was found for 10 pollen taxa. Thalictrum alpinum is a very good pollen indicator, and Cyperaceae, Eriophorum-type and Pedicularis-type are good pollen indicators of mowing. Poaceae/M. caerulea and Succisa pratensis are negatively correlated with mowing. The impact of mowing on species composition was similar in both study areas. Mown and unmown areas were differentiated in the vegetation data and could be identified by modern pollen data. These results will improve the interpretation of past land-use practices using pollen analysis of rich-fen vegetation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The richness and ecological roles of yeasts in peatlands are largely unknown. This paper presents a review of the literature on yeasts in peatlands and also provides new data with species isolated from peatlands in Saskatchewan, Canada, and West Siberia, Russia. To date, 75 yeast taxa have been reported from peatlands, including 46 identified species and 29 isolates identified only to genus or not at all. This represents 5%-10% of known yeasts and about 10% of all peatland fungi. Cryptococcus, Candida, Pichia, and Rhodotorula are the most prevalent genera, accounting for 58% of known peatland yeast species. We obtained 34 isolates from western Canadian and West Siberian bog and fen peat, including 12 identified species and eight unidentified taxa. Identified taxa comprised mostly species of Candida, Cryptococcus, and Rhodotorula. Unidentified taxa were described based on physiology and morphology. Globally, more species have been reported from bogs than fens (41 vs. 13 taxa), and the species composition differs between the two peatland classes. The effect of depth within the acrotelm on yeast abundance and species composition varies among peatlands. Physiological profiling of the yeasts from our study showed that they can use (poly)saccharides (primarily D-glucose, maltotriose, n-acetyl glucosamine, trehalose, and sucrose), organic acids (primarily D-gluconic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, and succinic acid), sugar alcohols (primarily D-arabitol, D-mannitol, and D-sorbitol), glycosides (primarily arbutin and salicin), and amino acids (primarily L-glutamic acid) as carbon and nitrogen sources. Based on these profiles, yeasts likely access simple polymers that leach from senesced and/or dead plant materials in peatlands and probably play important roles during the initial stages of organic matter decomposition.

AB Two new peat-based climate records from Ireland covering the late Holocene are presented. The sequences are dated by a strong chronological framework formed by AMS radiocarbon dates anal SCPs. Three proxy indicators (testate amoebae, macrofossils and humification) have been determined allowing the limitations and strengths of each to be identified and utilised to provide a bog surface wetness (BSW) record for both sites. Age-depth models take into account the potential for accumulation rates to vary with bog vegetation. The records from each site have been used to derive a combined BSW record that displays changes to a wetter/cooler climate from ca. AD 30 (1920 BP), ca. AD 310 (1640 BP), ca. AD 805 (1145 BP), ca. AD 1040 (910 BP) and ca. AD 1300 (650 BP). Changes follow closely those identified in a northern Britain composite BSW record and largely correspond with lake-level data in central France suggesting the main changes in water balance were coherent over a large region. Correspondence with increases in IRD and slower Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (I SOW) suggests that these changes were related to oceanic forcing influencing the track of dominant westerly air flow over Ireland.

AB Blanket bogs are a globally rare type of ombrotrophic peatland internationally recognized for long-term terrestrial carbon storage, the potential to serve as carbon sinks, habitat provision and for their palaeoenvironmental archive. This habitat is protected in the European Union under the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), but a number of blanket bogs located in the Cantabrian Mountains (northern Spain), representing the southernmost known edge-of-range for this habitat in Europe, are currently not recognized and are at increased threat of loss. Using climatic data, topography, aerial photography and peat depth surveys, this study has identified 10 new areas of blanket bog located between the administrative regions of Cantabria and Castilla y Leon. Peat depth data and topography were used to provide a detailed geomorphological description and hydromorphological classification (mesotope units) of these currently unrecognized areas of blanket bog. Maximum peat depth measured across the 10 sites ranged from 1.61 to 3.78 m, covering a total area of 18.6 ha of blanket bog (>40 cm peat depth). The volume of peat accumulated across the sites was determined to be more than 216 000 m(3)and is estimated to hold 19.89 +/- 3.51 kt C. Twenty-four individual hydrological mesotope units were described, indicating a diverse assemblage of blanket bogs in this region. The peatlands identified in this research extend the known limit of blanket bogs in Europe farther south than previously recorded and - combined with four other unprotected blanket bogs recently identified in the Cantabrian Mountains - these peatlands represent 10.5% of blanket bog currently recognized and protected in Spain. The range of anthropogenic pressures currently acting on peatlands in the Cantabrian Mountains indicates that without protection these important landforms and stored carbon may be lost. An urgent update of European peatland inventories is thus required to preserve these valuable carbon stores and potential carbon sinks. (c) 2020 The Authors.

AB Plant cover and past vegetation development of five mires were analyzed in different orographic and mesoclimatic situations along the NW-SE transect through the Bohemian Forest, Central Europe. Bogs at various altitudes (m). precipitation total (mm) and mean annual temperature (degreesC) were compared among: (1) wet windward cooling upslope plains at 860 m. 807 mm and 5.1degreesC (2) very wet, cold and wind-exposed summit plains at 1120 and 1060 m. 1337 and 1100 mm. 3.2degreesC and 3.7degreesC. respectively, and (3) downwind rain-shadow valleys at 750 m. 757 mm. and 6.2degreesC. The mires of summit plains differ from the others by both present day plant cover and past vegetation development,which began Lis late as the Preboreal, 10,000 years ago. Plant cover of their margins is predominated by the krummholz Pinus x pseudopumilio and open central mire expanses are noted by remarkable biodiversity and surface patterning. Mires of lover elevations are represented by domed raised-bogs forested by Pinus rotundata. According to pollen analysis, their development in the NW followed a typical sequence of the Bohemian Forest from the Late Glacial, with steppe-tundra prevailing 11,000 years ago, to the Boreal. with open Pinus and Corylus forests. Since the Atlantic period 6000 years ago, the surrounding forests were formed mainly by Picea, then by Picea and Fagus, and later by Abies, which became dominant in the whole Bohemian Forest since the Subboreal. 4000 years ago. Pinus expanded in the last 100 years. At present. herb and moss communities with scattered Betula pubescens occupy wet lagg. and closed-canopy bog-pine forest of primeval appearance covers the entire mire. In the SE bogs. the development started earlier. 13,000 years ago, Vegetation history here was slightly different Alnus-Betula carrs have developed since the Atlantic period. At present and in spite of NE. the very centers of these SE bogs remain open, in lagg woods of Betula pubescens with the undergrowth of Phragmites australis prevail. The analysis confirmed that development, vegetation and mire types correspond to the differences in mountain mesoclimate. In extrapolations of paleoecological data from mountain areas the diversification of biotic development has to be taken into account. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 was measured in four peatlands along plant community, hydrologic, and water chemistry gradients from bog to rich fen in a diverse peatland complex near Thompson, Manitoba, as part of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). A simple model for estimating growing season net ecosystem productivity (NEP) using continuous measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and peat temperature was constructed with weekly chamber measurements of NEE from May to October 1996. The model explained 79-83% of the variation in NEE across the four sites. Model estimation and parameter uncertainty calculations were performed using nonlinear regression analyses with a maximum likelihood objective function. The model underestimated maximum NEE and respiration during the midseason when the standard errors for each parameter were greatest. On a daily basis, uncertainty in the midday NEE simulation was higher than at night. Although the magnitude of both photosynthesis and respiration rates followed the trophic gradient bog less than poor fen less than intermediate fen less than rich fen, NEP did not follow the same pattern. NEP in the bog and rich fen was close to zero, while the poor and intermediate fens had higher NEP due to a greater imbalance between uptake and release of CO2. Although all sites had a positive growing season NEP, upper and lower 95% confidence limits showed that the bog and rich fen were either a source or sink of CO2 to the atmosphere, while the sedge-dominated poor and intermediate fens were accumulating approximately 20-100 g CO2 C m(-2) over the 5 month period in 1996. Peatland ecosystems may switch from a net sink to a source of carbon on short timescales with small changes in soil temperature or water table position. Since the difference between production and decomposition is small, it is important to understand and quantify the magnitude of uncertainty in these measurements in order to predict the effect of climatic change on peatland carbon exchange.

AB Boreal peatlands represent globally important long term sinks of carbon; however, horticultural peat extraction disrupts this carbon sink function, converting these ecosystems to large sources of greenhouse gases. Peatland restoration mitigates these emissions but to date no measurement of greenhouse gas exchange has been conducted on restored peatlands in western Canada, a region where continental climate could impact restoration success. We measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes during the growing season in a restored, cutover peatland in northern Alberta (Boreal Plain Ecozone) and compared these to fluxes measured on a neighboring unrestored area. Restoration resulted in a shift in mean growing season fluxes from 378g CO2C and 0.2g CH4-C at the unrestored site to 30g CO2-C and 3.7g CH4-C at the restored site, where positive values indicate flux of carbon from the peatland to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide exchange was correlated to vascular vegetation cover that varied depending on local water table position. Water table was also related to CH4 flux, with higher emissions from wet sites. Restoration activities should avoid creating very dry microsites where greenhouse gas emissions will remain high, while very wet sites may accumulate carbon as CO2 but will likely create areas of high CH4 flux.

AB Open-water mire pools play an important role in sustaining biodiversity. However, many mire pools have disappeared by artificial drainage all over the world. This study aimed at exploring how mire pools are changed by artificial drainage in terms of open water area and vegetation in Shizukari Mire, Hokkaido. We analyzed the changes of drainage ditches and open water of mire pools using multi-temporal aerial photographs. In order to elucidate how pool plant communities change by drainage, we analyzed the vegetation on the persisting pools and drained area of former pools. Our results indicated that most pools were lost soon after digging of ditches, and the remaining pools have shrunk by more diffuse, continued drainage effect. Due to open water loss, pool plant communities were considered to change towards the plant communities of drier conditions, comprising woody plants and non-wetland plant species. If the drainage continues, the remaining mire pools will ultimately disappear and the species composition of the mire could become more homogenous, being dominated by few species with high coverage.

AB Floral character in mires has changed progressively through time, In the Carboniferous, pteridophytes, sphenophytes and lycophytes were dominant but by the Permian gymnosperms were an important component of mire flora, During the early Mesozoic gymnosperms remained the characteristic mire vegetation, together with pteridophytes, and conifers became dominant during the Jurassic. Cretaceous and Paleocene vegetation are similar, with taxodiaceous flora being important in mire vegetation. From the Eocene onwards, however, angiosperms were increasingly dominant in mire communities and in the Miocene herbaceous vegetation began to play a significant role. Together with these changes in floral character at least three aspects of coal character also appear to vary sequentially with lime and are distinctive in the Tertiary: (1) proportions and thickness of vitrain banding, (2) coal bed thickness and (3) proportions of carbonised material, A compilation has been made of data from the coal literature comparing older coals with those of the Tertiary, in order to give a perspective in which to examine Tertiary coals. It was found that only Tertiary coals contain significant proportions of coal devoid of vitrain bands. In addition, Tertiary coals are the thickest recorded coal beds and generally contain low percentages of carbonised material (many less than 5%) as compared to older coals. It is interesting to note that Paleocene coal beds are similar to Cretaceous coals in that they tend to be thinner and contain higher proportions of carbonised material than do younger Tertiary coals.
   The absence of vitrain bands in some Tertiary coal beds is thought to result from the floras dominated by angiosperms, which are relatively easily degraded as compared to gymnosperms, The thickness of Tertiary coals may be related to an increase in biomass production from the Carboniferous through to the Tertiary, as plants made less investment in producing lignin, an energy-intensive process, In addition, with less lignin in plants, easier degradation of biomass may have facilitated nutrient recycling which, in turn, led to greater biomass production. Increased biomass production may have also 'diluted' the carbonised material present in some Tertiary pears, leading to lower proportions in the coal. Another possible cause of decreased carbonised components in Tertiary coal is that decreasing lignin content resulted in decreased charring during fires, as lignin is particularly prone to charring. A third possibility is that the carbonised component of peat may be concentrated during coalification so that Tertiary coals, generally of lower rank than Mesozoic or Paleozoic coals, contain a smaller fraction of carbonised plant material. It is not at present clear which of these mechanisms may have affected carbonised material in peat and coal but it is clear that lignin type and content has had an important role in determining peat and coal character since the Paleozoic.

AB The paper presents the results of field experiment on peat decomposition in peat deposits of mires in West Siberia and Poland. Two principal factors determining the dynamics of peat mass are revealed: position in relief and contribution from the below ground organs of herbaceous plants. In a raised bog, an upland microlandscape, maximum values of peat mass loss were obtained in the upper layer of peat and minimum values in the lower layer. In all poor fen ecosystems which are lowland microlandscapes, similar values of peat mass losses at different depths were obtained. In mire ecosystems with a considerable proportion of grasses in the phytocenosis, the supply of peat in the upper half-meter layer is replenished by dead below ground organs of plants.

AB Rich fens are known as biodiversity hot spots among peatlands encompassing many endangered bryophytes. In some European regions, specialised rich-fen bryophytes, including red-listed species, have been outcompeted by expansive Sphagnum species and competitively strong vascular plants. One of the main causes of the rapid succession was a cessation of traditional management such as scything, raking, or occasional grazing. Most of the current rich fens in Central and Western Europe depend on such management-related disturbances because they have been initiated or altered by humans. Removal of expansive Sphagnum species together with tussocks of graminoids is occasionally suggested to reverse the succession to previous rich fen stage before re-establishing the traditional management or its imitation. We carried out such treatment on 31 sites to restore microhabitats for fen-specialised bryophytes. Expansive Sphagnum species declined after the sod-and-moss removal. After one and a half years, the treated plots showed a gradual increase in species richness and abundance of fen-specialised bryophytes, which, however, only slightly increased in total cover. In regions where no Sphagnum species are endangered or legally protected, a sod-and-moss removal is a possible tool for restoration of rich fen vegetation that developed to poor fens because of modern anthropogenic interventions in the agricultural landscapes. However, its repetition after approximately a decade might be required due to the rapid regeneration of expansive Sphagnum species. Yet, further research is needed on the effectiveness and applicability of sod-and-moss removal over a longer period.

AB Our goal was to test, whether a classification by means of multivariate analysis could be used to revise the traditional vegetation classification of Cajanderian poor Picea abies mires of Finland, perhaps by including climatic variation alongside the ecological variation. We used agglomerative clustering (cluster analysis) for the classification and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) for interpreting gradients. A four-cluster solution provided a reasonable hierarchic classification with a poorer Rubus chamaemorus-Sphagnum angustifolium main group (including two site types) and a less poor Sphagnum girgensohnii main group (including two site types). The NMDS revealed a climatic south-north gradient (axis 1), an ecological poor-rich (fertility) gradient (axis 2) and a forest-mire gradient (axis 3). Distribution differences among the site types (i.e. climatic result) was a new feature for the Finnish Picea abies mires. The revised vegetation types can help in defining threatened habitat types at the national level as well as can be used in forest planning.

AB Electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS) was used to identify the qualitative differences between dissolved organic matter (DOM) in fen and bog porewaters from the Red Lake II system in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands (CLAP) of northern Minnesota. Approximately 80% of the molecular composition in surface porewater was maintained throughout the upper portion of the bog profile (0.17-2.50 m). The qualitative stability of the composition of the DOM was accompanied by a quantitative increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with depth. The composition of DOM in the fen was significantly different at depth, with slightly varying DOC levels. Aromaticity index (AI) values were used to identify condensed aromatic and phenol-type compounds in the porewater of both peatlands. Surface bog and deep fen DOM had surprisingly similar molecular composition. Differences in enzymatic degradation rates via phenol oxidase in the bog and surface fen horizons, slower transport down the bog vertical profile and the presence of a stratum of Sphagnum-woody peat at depth in the fen are suggested as being responsible for the observed variations in DOM composition.

ID TIME-DOMAIN REFLECTOMETRY; NEWFOUNDLAND
AB Time domain reflectometry (TDR) was used to estimate soil water storage dynamics in several uncultivated blanket bogs and poor fens in southeastern Newfoundland during the summer growing season. The purpose of the research was to evaluate links between surface moisture conditions, evapotranspiration, and recharge processes in order to elucidate factors that govern blanket pear formation in the region. Water storage changes in the peat/Sphagnum above the water table (Delta SWS) were found to be important storage terms in daily water balance estimates. Daily mean Delta SWS values for bog and fen approximated -0.3 and -0.45 mm, respectively. It was also found that, i) fairly high peat water-holding capacities, ii) frequent atmospheric recharge, iii) atmospheric controls on evapotranspiration, and, iv) the transport of water into the unsaturated zone from the shallow water table via capillary and external wicking processes helped to preclude significant de-watering over the bulk of the peatland surfaces. Recharge via groundwater appears to be an important factor governing moisture conditions requisite for peat accrual and the growth of Sphagnum spp., especially in the fens.

AB Belowground plant structures are inherently difficult to observe in the field. Sedge peat that mainly consists of partly decayed roots and rhizomes offers a particularly challenging soil matrix to study (live) plant roots. To obtain information on belowground plant morphology, research commonly relies on rhizotrons, excavations, or computerized tomography scans (CT). However, all of these methods have certain limitations. For example, CT scans of peat cores cannot sharply distinguish between plant material and water, and rhizotrons do not provide a 3D structure of the root system. Here, we developed a low-cost approach for 3D visualization of the root system in peat monoliths. Two large diameter (20 cm) peat cores were extracted, frozen and two smaller peat monoliths (47 x 6.5 x 13 cm) were taken from each core. Slices of 0.5 mm or 1 mm were cut from one of the frozen monoliths, respectively, using a paper block cutter and the freshly cut surface of the monolith was photographed after each cut. A 3D model of the fresh (live) roots and rhizomes was reconstructed from the resulting images of the thinner slices based on computerized image analysis, including preprocessing, filtering, segmentation and 3D visualization using the open-source software Fiji, Drishti, and Ilastik. Digital volume measurements on the models produced similar data as manual washing out of roots from the adjacent peat monoliths. The constructed 3D models provide valuable insight into the three-dimensional structure of the root system in the peat matrix.

AB We present the first testate amoeba-based palaeohydrological reconstruction from the Swiss Alps, and the first depth to the water table (DWT) calibration dataset for this region. Compared to existing models, Our new calibration dataset performs well (RMSEP=4.88), despite the length of the water table gradient covered (53 cm). The present-day topography and vegetation of the study mire Mauntschas suggest that it is partly ombrotrophic (large Sphagnum fuscum hummocks, one of which was the coring site) but mostly under the minerotrophic influence of springs in the mire and runoff from the surrounding area. Ombrotrophic Sphagnum fuscum hummocks developed at the sampling site only during the last 50 years, when testate amoebae indicate a shift towards dry and/or acid conditions. Prior to AD 1950 the water table was much higher, suggesting that the influence of the mineral-rich water prevented the development of ombrotrophic hummocks. The reconstructed DWT correlated with Pinus cembra pollen accumulation rates, suggesting that testate amoebae living on the mire and P. cembra growing Outside of it partly respond to the salve factor(s). Finally, temperature trends from the nearby meteorological station paralleled trends in reconstructed DWT. However, contrary to other studies made on raised bogs of northwestern Europe, the highest correlation was observed for winter temperature, despite the fact that testate amoebae would more logically respond to moisture conditions during the growing season. The observed correlation with winter temperature might reflect a control of winter severity on surface moisture during at least the first part of the growing season, through snow melt and soil frost phenomena influencing run-Off. More ecohydrological work on subalpine mires is needed to understand the relationships between climate, testate amoebae and peatland development. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Succession has a strong influence on species diversity and composition of terrestrial ecosystems. Peat bogs are among them. They have a large area in Belarus compared to other Central European countries. While in several studies have analyzed the effects of succession on vegetation in peat bog ecosystems, the response of peatland insects to succession has not been investigated yet. To address this issue were sampled Auchenorrhyncha abundance and environmental parameters on the ancient and one of the largest natural peat bog along a successional gradient from the margin to the bog dome. The results provide evidence that succession of peat bogs has influence on planthoppers and leafhoppers abundance, diversity and species composition. Along the successional gradient from younger towards older successional stages an increase abundance of specialized peat bog species, chamebionts, oligophagous and monophagous was observed. On the contrary, the younger stages of natural peat bog succession offer favorable conditions to eurytopic, polyphagous and chortobiont planthoppers and leafhoppers. The highest abundance and species richness of Auchenorrhyncha were in the lagg zone followed by early stages of natural peat bog succession. The highest diversity was in the middle stages of succession. A determinant of Auchenorrhyncha diversity was the cover of ericaceous dwarf shrubs. Linear models shrub cover and number of plants species had a positive effect on planthoppers and leafhoppers diversity and a negative effect on their abundance. Amount of ericaceous dwarf shrubs within the peat bog could be as a measure of heterogeneity.

AB Paleoecological studies indicate that peatland ecosystems may exhibit bistability. This would mean that these systems are resilient to gradual changes in climate, until environmental thresholds are passed. Then, ecosystem stability is lost and rapid shifts in surface and vegetation structure at landscape scale occur. Another remarkable feature is the commonly observed self-organized spatial vegetation patterning, such as string-flark and maze patterns. Bistability and spatial self-organization may be mechanistically linked, the crucial mechanism being scale-dependent (locally positive and longer-range negative) feedback between vegetation and the peatland environment. Focusing on bogs, a previous model study shows that nutrient accumulation by vascular plants can induce such scale-dependent feedback driving pattern formation. However, stability of bog microforms such as hummocks and hollows has been attributed to different local interactions between Sphagnum, vascular plants, and the bog environment. Here we analyze both local and longer-range interactions in bogs to investigate the possible contribution of these different interactions to vegetation patterning and stability. This is done by a literature review, and subsequently these findings are incorporated in the original model. When Sphagnum and encompassing local interactions are included in this model, the boundaries between vegetation types become sharper and also the parameter region of bistability drastically increases. These results imply that vegetation patterning and stability of bogs could be synergistically governed by local and longer-range interactions. Studying the relative effect of these interactions is therefore suggested to be an important component of future predictions on the response of peatland ecosystems to climatic changes.

AB The vegetation ecology of a paramo cushion mire was studied along four transects. Six local vegetation types were distinguished. Two types are called cushion bogs; one is dominated by Oreobolus cleefii and the other by Plantago rigida. Types 3 and 4 are mire vegetation dominated by bryophytes; one is characterised by Sphagnum sparsum, Breutelia sp. and Campylopus cucullatifolius, the other one is dominated by Lophozia subinflata with Cortaderia sericantha. Vegetation type 5 is dominated by submerged Sphagnum cyclophyllum; type 6 refers to aquatic vegetation with only Equisetum bogotense and algae.
   The relation between the first four vegetation types and edaphical and hydrological gradients is analysed by means of Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). From the results of CCA it can be concluded that the occurrence of the Oreobolus cleefii type is restricted to areas with a thinner peat layer, a wider distance surface-anaerobic zone and water table-anaerobic zone, a higher NO2 concentration and a lower pH. The occurrence of the Plantago rigida type is restricted to a situation with a lower electrical conductivity of the ground water, a lower N03 and PO, concentration, and a higher Fe concentration. The occurrence of the Sphagnum type is restricted to places with a higher conductivity of the ground water, a higher N03 and PO4 concentration, and a lower Fe concentration. The occurrence of the Lophozia subinflata with Cortaderia sericantha type is restricted to a situation with a lower K and Al concentration.

AB Peatlands represent a vast carbon reserve that has accumulated under conditions of low nitrogen availability. Given the strong coupling between the carbon and nitrogen cycles, we need to establish the consequences of the increase in reactive nitrogen deposition for the sustainability of peatlands, and whether the form in which the nitrogen is deposited makes a difference. We have addressed these questions using a globally unique field simulation of reactive N deposition as dry deposited ammonia and wet deposited reduced N, ammonium and oxidised N, nitrate, added as ammonium chloride or sodium nitrate, to an ombrotrophic peatland, Whim bog in SE Scotland. Here we report the fate of 56 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) additions over 10 yr and the consequences. The effects of 10 yr of reactive N additions depended on the form in which the N was applied. Ammonia-N deposition caused the keystone Sphagnum species, together with the main shrub Calluna and the pleurocarpous mosses, to disappear, exposing up to 30% of the peat surface. This led to a significant increase in soil water nitrate and nitrous oxide emissions. By contrast wet deposited N, despite significantly reducing the cover of Sphagnum and Pleurozium moss, did not have a detrimental effect on Calluna cover nor did it significantly change soil water N concentrations or nitrous oxide emissions. Importantly 10 yr of wet deposited N did not bare the peat surface nor significantly disrupt the vegetation enabling the N to be retained within the carbon rich peatland ecosystems. However, given the significant role of Sphagnum in maintaining conditions that retard decomposition, this study suggests that all nitrogen forms will eventually compromise carbon sequestration by peatlands through loss of some keystone Sphagnum species.

AB Modem extraction methods permit peat to be extracted to the minerotrophic layer of ombrotrophic peatlands (bogs). As the environmental conditions of these harvested peatlands are similar to minerotrophic peatlands (fens), such sites should be restored towards a fen system. However, it is not known whether fen species would recolonize such harvested sites on their own. We surveyed vegetation and environmental variables in 28 harvested peatlands with minerotrophic residual peat across Canada and in Minnesota, USA, and compared them to I I undisturbed fens. Compared to harvested bogs previously studied, the harvested fens sampled in this study revegetated remarkably quickly (50%-70% vegetation cover) when the hydrological conditions were suitable. However, revegetation was less extensive for sites that were still drained (25% vegetation cover). A high water table and a thin layer of residual peat were the most important factors contributing to rapid recolonization rates. Although the harvested fens were rapidly recolonized, species composition was not the same as observed on undisturbed fens. Carex and Sphagnum, dominant in undisturbed fens, generally did not recolonize harvested fens. Thus, whether the goal is to increase species richness or to ensure the return of peat accumulating functions, fen species may have to be actively introduced.

AB The large belowground carbon stocks in northern peatland ecosystems are potentially susceptible to release because of the expected differential responses of photosynthesis and respiration to climate change. This study compared net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) measured using the eddy covariance technique at two peatland sites in northern Alberta, Canada, over three growing seasons (May-October). We observed distinct differences between the poor fen (Sphagnum moss dominated) and extreme-rich fen (Carex sedge dominated) sites for their responses of NEE to interannual variation in temperature and water table depth. The rates of growing season cumulative NEE at the poor fen were very similar among the three study years with an average (+/- standard deviation) of -110.1 +/- 0.5 g C m (2) period (1). By contrast, the growing season cumulative NEE at the extreme-rich fen varied substantially among years (-34.5, -153.5, and -41.8 g C m(-2) period(-1) in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively), and net uptake of CO2 was lower (on average) than at the poor fen. Consistent with the eddy covariance measurements, analysis of Pb-210-dated peat cores also showed higher recent net rates of carbon accumulation in the poor fen than in the rich fen. Warm spring temperatures and sufficient water availability during the growing season resulted in the highest-magnitude ecosystem photosynthesis and NEE at the extreme-rich fen in 2005. Cool spring temperatures limited photosynthesis at the extreme-rich fen in 2004, while reduced water availability (lower water table) in 2006 constrained photosynthetic capacity relative to 2005, despite the warmer spring and summer temperatures in 2006. The combination of contrasting plant functional types and different peat water table features at our two study sites meant that the poor fen showed a reduced response of ecosystem CO2 exchange to environmental variation compared to the extreme-rich fen.

AB This study deals with changes in the plant cover and its net carbon sequestration over 30 years on a subarctic Sphagnum-mire with permafrost near Abisko, northernmost Sweden, in relation to climatic variations during the same period. Aerial colour infrared images from 1970 and 2000 were compared to reveal changes in surface structure and vegetation over the whole mire, while the plant populations were studied within a smaller, mainly ombrotrophic part. The results demonstrated two processes, namely (1) that wet sites dominated by graminoids expanded while hummock sites dominated by dwarf shrubs receded, and (2) that on the hummocks lichens expanded while evergreen dwarf shrubs and mosses decreased, both processes creating an instability in the surface structure. A successive degradation of the permafrost is the likely reason for the increase in wet areas, while the changes in the hummock vegetation might have resulted from higher spring temperatures giving rise to an intensified snow melt, exposing the vegetation to frost drought. Because of the vegetation changes, the annual litter input of carbon to the mire has increased slightly, by 4 g m(-2) a(-1) (7.3%), over these years while an increased erosion has resulted in a loss of 40-80 Mg carbon or 7-17 g m(-2) a(-1) for the entire mire over the same period. As the recalcitrant proportion of the litter has decreased, the decay rate in the acrotelm might be expected to increase in the future.

AB Peatlands are remarkable for their specific biodiversity, crucial role in carbon cycling and climate change. Their deposits preserve organism remains that can be used to reconstruct long-term ecosystem and environmental changes as well as human impact in the prehistorical and historical past. This study presents a new multi-proxy reconstruction of the peatland and vegetation development investigating climate dynamics and human impact at the border between mixed and boreal forests in the Valdai Uplands (the East European Plain, Russia) during most of the Holocene. We performed plant macrofossil, pollen, testate amoeba, Cladocera, diatom, peat humification, loss on ignition, carbon and nitrogen content, delta C-13 and delta N-15 analyses supported by radiocarbon dating of the peat deposits from the Krivetskiy Mokh mire. The results of the study indicate that the wetland ecosystem underwent a classic hydroserial succession from a lake (8300 BC-900 BC) terrestrialized through a fen (900 BC-630 AD) to an ombrotrophic bog (630 AD-until present) and responded to climate changes documented over the Holocene. Each stage was associated with clear changes in local diversity of organisms responding mostly to autogenic successional changes during the lake stage and to allogenic factors at the fen-bog stage. The latter can be related to increased human impact and greater sensitivity of peatland ecosystems to external, especially climatic, drivers as compared to lakes.

AB The restoration of peatland function and services on damaged peatland sites is seen as an increasingly important goal for ecological, environmental and societal reasons. Restoration monitoring often places fauna as secondary in importance to water table depth and vegetation, and when carried out, it often focuses on taxonomic indices. The use of functional traits, however, can be a complementary approach that clarifies mechanistic links between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
   This study was conducted in large blanket bog site in northern Scotland, using a space-for-time-substitution of restoration sites from which conifer plantations had been removed 2-18 years previously. Carabid beetles were sampled by pitfall trapping in each of three treatments (undamaged bog, restored, afforested). Functional trait data were summarised from available literature.
   The study found that sites under forestry had different functional traits than blanket bog, and that restoration initially shifted the suites of functional traits away from both forested and open blanket bog. However, no other change in functional traits was observed, and after two decades, restoration sites continue to support carabid communities with higher dispersal capacity and more diurnal activity than the open bog. On the other hand, the functional diversity measures used in this study failed to differentiate the different treatments and further analyses suggest that environment, rather than traits, better explain carabid beetle composition following restoration of formerly afforested blanket bog. In particular, the lack of recovery of typical blanket bog vegetation and microhabitat following felling to waste and drain blocking appear to limit carabid functional recovery.

AB The moss layer transfer technique is effective at restoring extracted peatland surfaces. However, remnant peatlands persist on the periphery of extracted surfaces. These remnant peatlands drop steeply to extracted surfaces, producing artificial ecotones that are more challenging to restore. We asked to what degree natural ecotones at undisturbed reference fens can act as models for the restoration of artificial ecotones around an extracted peatland, and whether management actions can ameliorate conditions in artificial ecotones. We compared changes in elevation, water table, peat, and multiple vegetation characteristics between natural ecotones and unmanaged artificial ecotones. We then clear-cut peripheral strips, completely filled perimeter canals, and smoothed peripheral slopes around sections of the extracted surfaces to assess whether hydrological conditions improved. Without management, artificial ecotones are not good models of natural ecotones. The elevation gradient is steep, and water tables drop steeply within 8 m of blocked perimeter canals, with possible effects at 25 m. The consequent vegetation had denser tree saplings, faster tree growth, almost no moss cover, and low moss species richness. After these management actions, water tables increased to within approximately 5 cm of those along natural ecotones. Future study is required to assess the extent of vegetation recovery, but these results hold promise for a more holistic rehabilitation of ecotones on the periphery of extracted peatland surfaces. We present recommendations to optimize the management actions on the periphery of extracted peatlands.

AB The article presents a study of the physico-chemical properties of fen peat and their influence on the metal accumulation patterns in three Latvian fens: Svetupes Mire, Elku Mire and Viku Mire. Full peat profiles were obtained at all study sites and analysed with a multi-proxy approach. The content of metals in fen peat was determined using the atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and normalised to the concentration of Ti in the studied peat profiles. Both the character of deposits and agricultural land use in the mire catchment areas were taken into account and the possible natural and anthropogenic metal supply sources were evaluated. The content of metals in the studied fen peat significantly varied due to the heterogeneity of fen environment; however, noticeable similarities were also traced throughout all study sites. The results indicate an increased amount of transition metals and Pb in the upper peat layer. This can be explained by a direct impact from anthropogenic sources (agricultural land use, pollution, etc.). Metal binding in fen peat profiles is directly related to the alkali and alkaline earth metal content in peat, as Ca, Mg, Na and K ions are replaced by more tightly bound metal ions. In raised bogs, in turn, metal binding is associated with the acidic functional groups cornmon to peat.

AB Montane wetlands in the North Cascades were dominated by small red peat moss, white marshmarigold, and many spiked cotton grass, the species with highest cover and frequency. Overall, 139 species were recorded in the 24 wetlands studied. Of the common species, nine were distributed independently of margin vs. central expanse locations, eight were more prominent in the margin habitat, and six were more prominent in the central expanse. Species diversity was described by species richness, and by Shannon-Wiener and Simpson's indices. These data were interpreted according to three wetland sizes (<0.5 ha; 0.5-1.5 ha: >1.5 ha) and margin vs. central expanse location. Species richness was significantly correlated with wetland size and was significantly greater in the larger wetlands. The Shannon-Wiener index was significantly correlated with wetland size and was significantly greater in wetland margins vs. central expanse. Simpson's index was unrelated to size or location in the wetland. Habitat heterogeneity in the wetlands was increased by buried logs, where conifer saplings were concentrated, even in the central expanse. North Cascades wetlands were distributed along gradients of elevation, annual precipitation, and degree of water movement. Lower elevation wetlands were characterized by higher annual precipitation and still water, whereas higher elevation wetlands were characterized by lower annual precipitation and moving water.

AB The plant macrofossil records from three raised bogs from western and central Ireland and from Cumbria were compared to investigate variations in the character and timing of the fen-bog transition (FBT). Two modes of raised or ombrotrophic peat formation were recognized. In the first mode the transition develops through a sedge-fen stage directly to raised-bog lawn, maintaining a near surface water table throughout the FBT (Abbeyknockmoy Bog). The second mode is characterized by a switch from fen or reedswamp to a dry Eriophorum-dominated mire type, suggestive of low or unstable water tables (Mongan Bog and Bolton Fell Moss). Comparisons with the Holocene effective precipitation record suggest that the type of transition and its timing may be affected by the prevailing climate regime. All that is required for ombrotrophy is a separation of the growing peat surface from the influence of ground and surface waters. This separation may be achieved by rapid peat accumulation in a moist climate, the accumulation of decay-resistant Eriophorum vaginatum hummocks or by a lowering of the water table, leading to a 'perched peat bed'. In the latter two cases, a I pseudo-raised bog' community often persists, laying down highly humified peat, until increased oceanicity enables Sphagnum to dominate.

AB 1. Peatlands are complex ecohydrological systems. In a theoretical modelling study we identify three ecohydrological links - commonly omitted from existing models - as potentially important to long-term peatland development, namely those between: I oxic-zone thickness and the rates of litter addition and depth-integrated decay; II time-integrated decay and hydraulic conductivity; and III drainage and peatland lateral expansion via paludification.
   2. In a simple model that includes none of these links, total peat thickness increases monotonically with annual rainfall, while oxic-zone thickness is controlled by the rates of litter addition and depth integrated decay.
   3. In an intermediate model that includes Link I, bi-stable behaviour occurs, with both 'dry' and 'wet' peatland forms possible at low rainfall, but only 'wet' peatland forms possible above a threshold value of rainfall. This finding agrees with those from a similar published model.
   4. In a more complicated model that includes both Link I and Link II, the bi-stability of the intermediate model is lost. Increases in net rainfall lead to little change in oxic-zone thickness because the model's feedbacks confer self-dampening (stabilizing) behaviour. Bog height after 5000 years is maximal at an intermediate anoxic decay rate, an initially counter-intuitive finding that reflects complex behaviour arising from the interacting feedbacks represented within the model.
   5. In a final model that includes Links I, II and a partial representation of Link III, the mode of peatland lateral expansion (i.e. linear, logarithmic or step-wise expansion) has a strong effect on patterns and rates of peat accumulation.
   6. Synthesis. Understanding long-term peatland development requires consideration of ecohydrological feedbacks; models without such feedbacks are likely to misrepresent peatland behaviour. Down-profile changes in peat properties, commonly taken to indicate external (climatic) influences in palaeoclimatic studies, may in some cases be consequences of internal peatland dynamics under a steady climate.

AB In Albertas Western Boreal Plain, oil sands mining strips overburden materials including vegetation and soils, leaving unnatural, undulating landforms where wetlands previously covered > 50% of the landscape. Due to their complexity, the re-establishment of peatland ecosystems had not been tested prior to two fen reclamation projects on oil sands leases north of Fort McMurray. One of which, the Nikanotee Fen, was constructed using peat stripped as part of the mining process and placed in an engineered watershed designed to provide the requisite groundwater supply to support fen hydrological functions and vegetation. The unknown effects of disturbed, placed peat and vegetation treatments on the constructed fens soil water dynamics were studied from 2013 to 2015, the first three growing seasons post-construction. Water table, soil moisture (theta), pore water pressure (Psi), evapotranspiration (ET) and surface elevation were monitored in thirty-one study plots designed to test revegetation strategies, including control (bare peat), moss, seedling, mulched moss and mulched seedling treatments. Fifty-four peat samples were tested for a suite of hydrophysical parameters, including saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and soil-water retention. Plot water table positions fluctuated 36 cm below ground surface (bgs) despite a relatively small range in surface elevation between plots (similar to 24 cm), where plots located at higher elevations had consistently lower and more variable water tables. Although average plot water tables all ranged within 5-7 cm bgs, theta, Psi and ET differed significantly between certain plot types (p < 0.05). The observed hydrology is partially affected by the heterogeneous peat properties across the fen, created by the salvage and placement methods of the peat, which significantly differed with location (p < 0.05). The variability in the hydrophysical properties and surface elevations, thus water table position, appear to mask the effects of vegetation and treatment type on plot hydrology, at least at this early stage of development. While significant increases in plot Psi and theta were observed from 2013 to 2015, further studies are required to track the effects of greater vegetation establishment and peat formation and elucidate the effects of different vegetation treatments.

   Implication for climate change?
SO GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY

DT Article
ID SUBFOSSIL PINE; TEMPERATURE
AB A dendrochronological study was made on fossil tree trunks of Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris, preserved in a pear bog at Hanvedsmossen, 50 km SW of Stockholm, Sweden. Of 56 sampled pines, 48 were assembled in a 204-year long floating chronology. The chronology spans 1686-1483 Be +/- 23 years. The trunks are found at the very bottom of the pear accumulation. Because the roots stand in underlying clay, the tree stand germinated before or simultaneously with bog growth and provides maximum age for bog vegetation development which started c. 1480 Be. The pine growth steadily decreased during the last 30 years of the chronology and most trees died during the same period. It is proposed that the drainage outlets from Hanvedsmossen overgrew with brushwood simultaneously with the succession of pines, resulting in a higher sensitivity of tree growth to small changes in water levels. The preservation of the logs is suggested to be a re suit of a raised water table providing anaerobic conditions and later the logs were enveloped by peat growth. It is suggested that this period was the initial phase of the ensuing climate deterioration. The climate shifted to wetter conditions, i.e, higher amounts of precipitation, lower temperature or bath. This resulted in lower evaporation giving additional peat bog growth and a locally raised water table.

AB P>1. We investigated the characteristics and causes of striped patterning in minerotrophic Sphagnum cristatum mires on the western Central Plateau in Tasmania by surveying the mire vegetation, surface and subsurface topography, analysing their topographic exposure to the prevailing strong winds relative to non-striped mires, stratigraphic analysis, measurements of wind speed and direction across and along ridges and swales in typical synoptic conditions, and measurement of growth rates and asymmetry of shrubs.
   2. The stripes were orientated south-west-north-east, independent of the aspect of the general slope. The shrub Richea scoparia was dominant on the north-west-facing slopes of the low ridges that formed the stripes. Sphagnum cristatum was dominant on the south-east-facing ridge slopes and the restiad, Baloskion australe was dominant in the swales. The stripes were independent of the topography of the underlying block stream. Striped mires were more exposed to both north-westerly and south-westerly winds than non-striped mires.
   3. Strong north-westerly winds formed rotors behind each ridge, with wind speed being highest on the north-west-facing ridge slope and lowest on the south-east-facing ridge slope. The annual growth of R. scoparia inversely reflected this variation in wind speed. South-westerly winds were stronger in the swales than on the ridges and stronger on the south-west extremity of the ridges than further to the north-east. Asymmetry in R. scoparia on the ridges reflected this variation in wind speed.
   4. We infer that the ridges slowly migrate in a cyclic successional pattern as the result of differential growth rates of R. scoparia in response to variation in the speed of drying north-westerly winds. The stripes appear to result from training of shrubs by strong, cold south-westerly winds, which also inhibit the growth of R. scoparia in the swales.
   5. Synthesis. There are no other documented cases of wind-controlled patterning and cyclic succession in mires, and no case of exposure to two distinct wind directions being responsible for patterning in any vegetation type. The distinctiveness of the process and the form merit recognition of these striped mires as outstanding in their universal value under the world heritage area criteria.

AB In view of the extremely important role of wetlands, an attempt was made to determine the state of preservation of peat forming processes as a condition for the proper functioning of those areas. By addressing this question, we hoped to determine whether the peat bogs and mires of the Lcczna-Wlodawa Plain currently act as carbon sources. The aim of the present study was to compare the ash content and the contents of selected macro-and micronutrients in the deposits. The research was carried out in the years 2010-2013 and covered eight peatland areas (three midfield and five mid-forest peatlands). The ash content, as well as the content of biogens, and selected macro- and micronutrients of the studied deposits varied and depended on the type of the deposit forming a given layer. In all the studied deposits, the carbon content was high, especially in the transitional Sedge-Sphagnum peat and the raised pine peat. The marsh layers, in relation to the studied peat minerals and gyttja, were characterized by a lower carbon content, and the restriction of C:N and N:P ratios. In all the studied peat bogs, located in the Lcczna-Wlodawa Plain, the accumulation phase dominated, so they do not act as carbon suppliers.

AB In the cool-temperate Bibi Mire, Hokkaido, Japan, valley fens and flood-plain fens have quite different vegetation. The main variables controlling the vegetation were all hydrological: mean water level, water level fluctuation and surface water flow. Chemical factors such as electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen and related pear decomposition were less important. The pH was about neutral and has little effect. The flood-plain fen developed under fluctuating water table conditions. The dominant species are Calamagrostis langsdorffii and Carex pseudocuraica. When temporal inundation occurs in the rainy or typhoon seasons, the submergence stimulates bud germination of the stoloniferous C. pseudocuraica, which can rapidly elongate its stolons upward. Some large floating peat mars occurred in the flood-plain fen zone. On these mats some Alnus japonica saplings establish and patches of alder forest can arise. Here the water level was higher than in the peripheral alder forest zone.
   The valley fen is dominated by Carex lasiocarpa var. occultans and/or C. limosa. It is formed under stable water table conditions in the inundated parts of the mire -where the non-inundated wet areas are dominated by alder trees. In the area where the surface water is flowing, these two fen sedges grow in deeper water since the high oxygen content is considered to compensate the flooding stress.

AB Peat cores from boreal bog and fen sites in the Hudson Bay Lowlands of Northern Ontario, Canada, were analysed to calculate Holocene carbon accumulation rates, and to show how testate amoeba taxonomic assemblages, inferred depths to water table, and four morpho-traits that may be linked to function (mixotrophy, aperture size, aperture position, and biovolume) changed since peatland initiation. Carbon accumulation rates were on average higher for the Holocene in the fen record (19.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) in comparison with the bog record (15.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), which underwent a fen-to-bog transition around 6900 cal yr BP. Changes in rates of carbon accumulation were most strongly driven by changes in rates of peat vertical accretion, with more rapid rates in the fen record. Carbon accumulation rates were highest following peatland initiation when reconstructed water tables were highest, and in the late Holocene, when water table positions were variable. Taxa with larger biovolumes and apertures were generally more abundant when reconstructed water tables were higher, most notably following peatland initiation. Mixotrophic taxa were more prevalent in drier conditions and in the bog record. Changing frequencies of morpho-traits suggest that testate amoebae may occupy a higher trophic position in the microbial food web during wetter periods, signaling the possibility of internal feedbacks between peatland ecohydrology and critical ecosystem functions including long-term carbon accumulation.

AB Northern peatlands store approximately one-third of the terrestrial soil carbon (C), although they cover only 3% of the global land mass. Northern peatlands can be subdivided into bogs and fens based on their hydrology and biogeochemistry. Peat/and hydrology and biogeochemistry are tightly coupled to climate and, therefore, may be very sensitive to climate variability and change. To address the fate of the large peatland soil C storage under a future changed climate, a peatland C model, the McGill Wetland Model (MWM), was coupled to a land surface climate model (the wetland version of the Canadian Land Surface Scheme, CL4SS3W), referred as CLASS3W-MWM. We evaluated the CL4SS3W-MWM for a bog (Mer Bleue, located at 45.41 degrees N, 75.48 degrees W, in eastern Canada) and a poor fen (Degero Stormyr, located at 64 degrees 11'N, 19 degrees 33'E, in northern Sweden).
   CLASS3W-MWM captured the magnitude and direction of the present day C cycling very well for both bogs and fens. Moreover, the seasonal and interannual variability were reproduced reasonably well. Root mean square errors (RMSE) were <0.65 and the degree of agreements (d*) were >0.8 for the components of net ecosystem production (NEP) for both the Mer Bleue bog and the Degero Stormyr fen. The performance of the coupled model for both bog and fen is similar to that of the stand-alone MWM driven by observed weather rather than simulated surface and soil climate. This modelling study suggests that northern peatlands are hydrologically and thermally conservative ecosystems. It was also shown that C cycling for bogs and fens was more sensitive to changes in air temperature than precipitation. Changes in temperature within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected range switch the peatlands from a present-day C sink to a source, but projected changes in precipitation still maintain the peatlands as a C sink, although to a somewhat lesser degree. Increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration enhances C sequestration for both bogs and fens. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that northern peatlands respond to changes in temperature, precipitation and doubled CO2 concentration in a highly non-linear way. The sensitivity of C cycling in northern peatlands with respect to changes in air temperature, precipitation and the concentration of atmospheric CO2 together is not a simple addition or subtraction of the sensitivity of the individual changes. Therefore, the sensitivity of a combination of changes in temperature, precipitation and doubled CO2 concentration is very different from the sensitivity of peatlands to each environmental variable on their own. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that fens have a narrower tolerance to climate changes than bogs.

AB The importance of peatlands is being increasingly recognized internationally for both the conservation of biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services; strategies are being developed world-wide to help maintain their integrity. Prescribed burning has been highlighted as a threat with considerable debate over its use as it is perceived to produce a Calluna vulgaris monoculture and a decline in preferred peat-forming species. We investigated the impact of prescribed burning on vegetation composition and diversity in a long-term experiment at Moor House NNR in northern England. The study comprised a comparison between no-burn reference plots last burned in ca. 1924 and an experiment where all plots were burned in 1954/5. Within the experiment, the effects of very light sheep grazing vs. no grazing and three burning rotations (no-burn since 1954/5, repeat-burning at 10- and 20-year intervals) were tested. Calluna vulgaris and Hypnum jutlandicum cover and bryophyte species richness increased in the least-disturbed, no-burn reference plots, but bryophyte cover did not. Lichen diversity declined. Within the formal experiment, low-intensity sheep grazing had little impact but there were substantive changes produced by the different burning rotations. There was divergence between the burning rotation treatments with the least-disturbed, no-burn treatment changing towards a C.vulgarisH.jutlandicum community, whereas the most-disturbed 10-year rotation had a much greater abundance of both Eriophorum and Sphagnum spp. Synthesis and applications. Our findings suggest that blanket-bog vegetation on peat responds to prescribed burning in a complex manner. Where burn return interval is long (>20years), C.vulgaris becomes dominant and there was no evidence that preferred peat-forming species (Eriophorum/Sphagnum) increased. Where burn return interval is short (10years), E.vaginatum/Sphagnum abundance increased. We found no evidence to suggest that prescribed burning was deleterious to the abundance of peat-forming species; indeed, it was found to favour them. These results inform conservation management policy for blanket bogs in the UK and more generally for future wildfire-mitigation strategies on dwarf-shrub-dominated peatlands elsewhere. Some lessons for the management of long-term experimental studies are also discussed.

AB Freshwater wetlands around the Mediterranean Sea have decreased considerably in number and quality. Greece has lost two thirds of its wetlands during the last seventy-five years; however, many wetlands with considerable conservation value remained. Kalodiki Fen is an inland, freshwater wetland belonging to the western chain of Greek wetlands. This paper describes the plant communities of Kalodiki Fen and their synecology. To determine the relationship between vegetation and environmental parameters, the vegetation of Kalodiki Fen is described and analysed in terms of parameters determining the observed distribution pattern. Eighteen vegetation types, of which nine are ranked as associations and nine as frame communities, are described and are presented in a synoptic table. They belong to the Phragmition communis, Magnocaricion elatae, Nymphaeion albae, Parvopotamion, Ranunculion aquatilis, Lolio-Potentillion anserinae, Nerion oleandri, and Bidention tripartitae. Through ordination, soil moisture and water depth, and to a lesser extent nitrogen, were identified as underlying environmental factors determining the composition of these plant communities. Community differentiation follows an edaphic-water depth pattern. The floristic and vegetation value of the wetland is discussed as a basis for the application of conservation management measures.

AB P>Vascular wetland plants may substantially increase methane emissions by producing root exudates and easily degradable litter, and by providing a low-resistance diffusion pathway via their aerenchyma. However, model studies have indicated that vascular plants can reduce methane emission when soil oxygen demand is exceeded by oxygen released from roots. Here, we tested whether these conditions occur in bogs dominated by cushion plants.
   Root-methane interactions were studied by comparing methane emissions, stock and oxygen availability in depth profiles below lawns of either cushion plants or Sphagnum mosses in Patagonia.
   Cushion plants, Astelia pumila and Donatia fascicularis, formed extensive root systems up to 120 cm in depth. The cold soil (< 10 degrees C) and highly decomposed peat resulted in low microbial activity and oxygen consumption. In cushion plant lawns, high soil oxygen coincided with high root densities, but methane emissions were absent. In Sphagnum lawns, methane emissions were substantial. High methane concentrations were only found in soils without cushion plant roots.
   This first methane study in Patagonian bog vegetation reveals lower emissions than expected. We conclude that cushion plants are capable of reducing methane emission on an ecosystem scale by thorough soil and methane oxidation.

AB This study evaluates relationships between vegetation and stable isotope distribution within a large, northern peat-accumulating wetland. Concentration and delta(13)C for both porewater and emitted methane were obtained from June-September for two systems characterized by different plant assemblages and hydrologic regimes: a Carer-dominated fen and a Sphagnum-dominated, forested bog crest. Average methane emissions were higher in the fen than at the bog crest across the entire growing season. Fen porewater methane concentrations were maintained at consistently low levels in the upper one-third of the peat column, and emitted methane was substantially C-13-depleted (by approx. 6 parts per thousand) relative to shallow porewater methane, trends which are characteristic of passive plant-mediated transport of rhizospheric methane to the atmosphere. Fen porewater delta(13)C-CH4 values in shallow pear (approx. -59 parts per thousand) suggest that microbial respiration was primarily driven by acetate fermentation. CO2 reduction became more important deeper in the peat column with delta(13)C-CH4 values ranging from approx. -65 to -69 parts per thousand between 1 and 2.8 m. In contrast to the fen, porewater methane concentrations in the bog were usually at near-maximum levels just below the water table. delta(13)C values for emitted CH4 in the bog were enriched relative to those for shallow porewater CH4 by approx. 10 parts per thousand, indicating that methane was subject to oxidation as it exited from the pear via passive diffusion. Methanogenesis in the peat at the bog crest appears to have been substrate-limited, with porewater delta(13)C-CH4 (approx. -67 parts per thousand) suggestive of CO2 reduction at all depths.

AB An empirical model for the annual shoot production of heather Calluna vulgaris in the absence of grazing in the uplands of Great Britain is presented. Production is modelled as a function of the growth phase of the heather and weather conditions during the summer growing season and the previous winter.
   The effects of grazing, principally by sheep, on changes in heather cover after burning are reviewed. A simple model of annual cover change is proposed, and fitted to data from dry and wet heaths in Scotland.
   A model of the influence of grazing on annual heather shoot production is developed for dry heath.
   The models indicate that previously published estimates of the utilization levels that heather can tolerate without a reduction in shoot production may be too high. For pioneer and early building heather, estimated threshold utilization levels are 16% in summer and 24% in autumn. Furthermore, it is suggested that any level of utilization will reduce the rate of increase of heather ground cover after burning.

AB We conducted a multi-year study in two boreal peatlands to determine the impacts of resource access roads on methane (CH4) emission from adjacent peatland. Data were collected from transects aligned perpendicular to, and on both sides of two roads, one cutting through a bog and one cutting through a fen and from reference areas at each peatland. During the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017, we measured CH4 flux, water table, and peat temperature every second week. At the bog, the road associated impacts (changes to water table, peat temperature, and vegetation cover) were visible up to 20 m on both sides of the road (disturbed areas) with CH4 emission from disturbed areas being significantly higher compared to the reference areas in both years. There were no significant differences in CH4 emissions from disturbed areas compared to reference areas at the fen due to the limited hydrologic impact of the road crossing at this site. Bog plots located upstream of the road on transects located at >20 m from culverts and closer to the road emitted significantly more CH4 (124.6-mg CH4.m(-2).day(-1)) than other disturbed (10.2 mg CH4.m(-2).day(-1)) and reference areas (0.7-mg CH4.m(-2).day(-1)) due to shallower water table and warmer peat temperature. The road induced CH4 emissions (90.8 and 212.2 kg CH4/year for each kilometer of road, in 2016 and 2017, respectively) indicated that road construction across peatlands enhances CH4 emissions from these ecosystems, creating an additional source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas.
   Plain Language Summary Construction of resource access roads is common across the boreal region of Canada, and significant numbers of these roads are passing through peatlands. Peatlands are natural sources of methane, which is one of the important greenhouse gases. To determine the impacts of resource access roads on methane emission from the adjacent peatland, we conducted a study in two boreal forested peatlands (a bog and a fen). Our results showed that, at the bog, methane emission from disturbed areas were significantly higher compared to the reference areas. Similarly, the changes to the water table, peat temperature, and vegetation cover were visible up to 20 m on both sides of the road. In contrast, we did not find differences in methane emissions from disturbed areas compared to reference areas at the fen due to the limited hydrologic impact of the road crossing at this site. The increased methane emission from road adjacent areas indicates that road construction across peatlands enhances methane emissions from these ecosystems, creating an additional source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas. However, our study showed that aligning roads parallel to water flow when and where possible, and adequate culvert placement can help to minimize induced methane emissions.

AB Inter-dune wetlands in Europe harbour many Red List species because they are very nutrient-poor ecosystems. Most of these wetlands are geologically very young and no or little peat formation has occurred. In Slitere National Park the numerous inter-dune wetlands are relatively old, up to 4500 years old, and most mire communities are peat forming and they are well preserved. However, the hydrological systems that have conserved the mires are largely unknown. In the present study we analysed 128 vegetation relevees of dune mires in order to assess the variation in ecological mire types. We also carried out several short-time studies to get an insight into the peat development and hydrological conditions that sustain the mires. We describe peat profiles and measured temperature profiles and electrical conductivity in 26 dune valleys. We distinguished three main vegetation units and ten sub-units, representing various stages in peat formation. Based on electrical conductivity and temperature profiles we hypothesised that the mires were sustained by both local and more regional groundwater flows, of which the latter were possibly disturbed by anthropogenic influences, mainly outside the National Park. The importance of the Park was evaluated by comparing it to species lists of wetlands from all countries bordering the Baltic Sea. On the European scale the inter-dune wetlands of Slitere National Park are very important because they represent well-developed examples of mire formation on a landscape scale, which elsewhere in most of Europe are rare or have become extinct due to intensive land use.

AB This study presents a new data synthesis of Finnish peatland area and carbon (C) store in peat from 1950 to 2015. We present updated results from the most comprehensive compilation of Finnish peat soil properties with associated C accumulation rates from undrained mires and C sources from different forms of anthropogenic land use. Since 1950, different forms of land use of Finnish peatlands have reduced the total peat C store by 3-10%, approximately 172-510 Tg. The most significant C losses have occurred from forestry-drained peatlands, but significant losses have also occurred from agricultural peat soils, peat extraction, and other forms of peatland exploitation such as building water reservoirs. However, the C accumulation of undrained mires and especially the increased biomass production of drained peatlands have partly compensated for the anthropogenic C losses. The total C store of peatland vegetation biomass (trees, seedlings, ground vegetation, detritus and below-ground roots) was estimated to have increased by 92 Tg due to intensive peatland drainage. The present total C store of Finnish peatland ecosystems was estimated at 5618 Tg, which includes 5079 Tg as peat. The total C store estimate is approximately 1-7 % lower compared to the 1950s. Today, the undrained mires still represent a significant national C sink, with the rate of C sequestration estimated at 0.82 Tg yr(-1). However, across all land uses the present peat soil is a C source by 3.7-10.0 Tg yr(-1). Significant anthropogenic C losses from peat soil underline the urgent need for sustainable C management of all peatlands, including the preservation of the C store in existing natural mires, stopping land clearing on undisturbed organic soils, and improving the peatland hydrology by restoration to create long-term C sinks especially within the large unproductive drainage area and northern aapa mire area.

AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from pristine peatlands and peatlands drained for agriculture, forestry or peat extraction have been studied intensively. However, few studies have compared GHG emissions from peatlands under different land-use type within the same peatland area. This study examined methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and respiration (CO2) from a peatland complex in northern Finland, including a peatland used for grass cultivation, a Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens dominated forested peatland, a peat-extraction site and a pristine mire. Gas fluxes were measured in 2011 and 2012 with chambers during the snow-free period, and using the snow-gradient method in winter 2012/2013. Soil respiration was highest in the cultivated site (median during growing season 350 mg CO, m(-2) h(-1)), and lower in the forest site and in the peat-extraction site (median for growing season 49 and 130 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), respectively). The peat-extraction site and the cultivated site were large sources of N2O during the growing season (median 89 and 28 pig m(-2) h(-1), respectively) and during the winter (median 56 and 460 mu g m(-2) h(-1), respectively). The pristine site was a large source of CH4 during the growing season (median 0.98 mg m(-2) h(-1)), whereas CH4 emissions from the drained sites during the growing season were minor. However, during winter, the peat-extraction site and the cultivated site emitted CH4 (median 0.58 and 0.029 mg m(-2) h(-1), respectively). The cultivated site had the highest estimated CO2 equivalent emissions, due to the high CO2 and N2O fluxes, but the peat-extraction site also had large annual emissions, mainly as N2O. The study suggests that rising ground-water level from 60 to 40 cm could potentially mitigate the emissions from the cultivated site.

AB Peatlands in Australia and New Zealand are composed mainly of Restionaceous and Cyperaceous peats, although Sphagnum peat is common in wetter climates (Mean Annual Precipitation > 1,000mm) and at higher altitudes (> 1,000m). Experimental trials in two contrasting peatland typesfire-damaged Sphagnum peatlands in the Australian Alps and cutover restiad bogs in lowland New Zealandrevealed similar approaches to peatland restoration. Hydrological restoration and rehydration of drying peats involved blocking drainage ditches to raise water tables or, additionally in burnt Sphagnum peatlands, peat-trenching, and the use of sterilized straw bales to form semipermanent dam walls and barriers to spread and slow surface water movement. Recovery to the predisturbance vegetation community was most successful once protective microclimates had been established, either artificially or naturally. Specifically, horizontally laid shadecloth resulted in Sphagnum cristatum regeneration rates and biomass production 3-4 times that of unshaded vegetation (Australia), and early successional nurse shrubs facilitated establishment of Sporadanthus ferrugineus (New Zealand) within 2-3 years. On severely burnt or cutover sites, a patch dynamic approach using transplants of Sphagnum or creation of restiad peat islands markedly improved vegetation recovery. In New Zealand, this approach has been scaled up to whole mine-site restoration, in which the newly vegetated islands provide habitat and seed sources for plants and invertebrates to spread onto surrounding areas. Although a vegetation cover can be established relatively rapidly in both peatland types, restoration of invertebrate communities, ecosystem processes, and peat hydrological function and accumulation may take many decades.

AB We studied the effects of experimentally induced variation in leaf litter chemistry on leaf litter decomposition and leaf litter nutrient release of Carer species from habitats that differ in nutrient availability. Carer diandra, C. rostrata, and C. lasiocarpa are dominant in less productive mesotrophic fens, whereas C. acutiformis is dominant in more productive eutrophic fens. For each species, three types of litter were used: litter collected in the field (FLD); and litter from experimental populations grown at low (LN: 3.3 g N . m(-2). yr(-1)) and high N supply (HN: 20.0 g N . m(-2). yr(-1)). For all the litter chemistry parameters studied there were highly significant interactions between species and litter type. This implies that, due to differential plant-mediated controls on leaf litter chemistry, it is not always possible to predict changes in litter chemistry in response to increased nutrient supply.
   Litter decay was determined in a long-term (3 yr) field experiment using litter bags. The litter types of each species were incubated at their native growing sites. Contrary to what is generally found, the leaf litter decomposition rate of the species growing at the nutrient-poorest site (C. diandra) was higher than that of the species growing at the nutrient richest site (C. acutiformis). Only for C. diandra and C. lasiocarpa was the decomposition rate of the litter from the HN treatment higher than that of the field litter. Thus, increased nutrient supply does not necessarily lead to higher litter decomposition rates. Nutrient controls on litter decay changed with time: initial litter decay (less than or equal to 3 mo) was strongly controlled (high r(2) values) by all P-related litter quality parameters, whereas long-term litter decay (>1 yr) was most strongly related with the phenolics : N ratio, the phenolics : P ratio, the lignin : N ratio, and the C:N ratio. Our data suggest that high levels of atmospheric N deposition, such as in the study area (The Netherlands), may lead to a relative shortage of P in the plant-derived substrates for bacteria and fungi. As a result, P-related litter chemistry parameters exert a strong influence on litter decay.
   Our data did not support the hypothesis that high-nutrient species increase nutrient cycling due to the production of easily decomposable litter with high rates of nutrient release. The leaf litter from Carer acutiformis, the species from the high-productivity fens, decomposed more slowly than that of the other species, immobilized more N and P and had a longer period of net N and P immobilization. However, this species has a higher litter production than the other species and thereby increases the rate of nutrient cycling. At the intraspecific level, increased nutrient supply led to lower amounts of immobilized N and P and faster N and P release from litter in most species, and thereby to a higher rate of nutrient cycling. This positive feedback between nutrient supply rate and the rate of nutrient cycling is reinforced by the increase in litter production in response to increased nutrient supply.

AB We studied vegetation changes in a small floating mat bog in Mizorogaike Pond (Kyoto, Japan), which had experienced a severe decrease in the number and area of hummocks caused by nutrient loading in the 1960s and 1970s, to examine whether reducing the extent of nutrient loading can restore degraded wetland vegetation. However, nutrient loading in the region has been minimized since the 1980s. We examined the distributions of hummocks and Sphagnum cuspidatum mats in 1980, 1988, and 2006, as well as nine major vascular plants that dominated the hollows on the floating mat in 1980 and 2006. The total area of normal hummocks formed by Sphagnum palustre increased from 5865.3 m(2) in 1980 to 5913.6 m(2) in 1988 and 8485.2 m(2) in 2006. The total area of the S. cuspidatum mats also changed, from 416.4 m(2) in 1980 to 322.3 m(2) in 1988 and 1012.5 m(2) in 2006. Examination of the spatial distribution patterns of major plants revealed that emergent plants decreased in the northern part of the mat, but increased in the southern part. Thus, the improved pond water quality was effective at restoring hummocks, although nutrient loading may have caused some irreversible changes in the wetland vegetation.

AB The spatial development and vegetation history of a large boreal peatland complex in east-central Alberta was reconstructed to examine factors that control peatland development in continental regions. Peat depth throughout the site was interpolated from over 300 depth measurements, and basal radiocarbon dates were obtained from 16 cores. Peat first initiated about 7400 calibrated C-14 years BP (cal. BP), and early peat-forming communities were wet fens or marshes. Rates of expansion from these nucleation sites were dependent on both moisture availability and topography, with asynchronous expansion in different regions. Basal macrofossil assemblages suggest that paludification on slopes of large basins was the result of flooding caused by rising peatland water tables. In many areas that initiated after 3000 cal. BP, paludification involved invasion of upland forest by Sphagnum. Long-term apparent rates of peat accumulation were fastest in wet, moderate-rich fen areas where little community change has occurred over time. Macrofossil analysis of core profiles reveals a tendency for sites that initiated wet and minerotrophic to eventually be colonized by Sphagnum. However, the thickness of surficial Sphagnum layers differs between cores, and there are several examples of minimal or apparently reverse successional development.

AB At the biogeographical limit between the boreal and the subarctic domain in northeastern Canada, peatlands are mainly oligotrophic fens characterized by a dominance of aquatic microforms such as pools and wet hollows. These peatlands present similar features as the appa mires in Scandinavia. They show evidence for recent water-table rise indicated by tree mortality, physical degradation of strings, and pool expansion. This study aims to evaluate the timing of pool inception and their impact on the long-term dynamics of these microforms within two patterned oligotrophic fens in the Laforge region, northern Quebec. Plant macrofossil and testate amoeba analyses from sediment underneath pools were used along with radiocarbon dating to reconstruct peatland pool dynamics over the Holocene. Our data indicate that wet hollows or shallow pools developed at minimal ages between similar to 4200 and similar to 2500 cal. a BP. Pool initiation in the peatlands of the Laforge region corresponds to the climate shift toward cooler and wetter conditions from the onset of the late-Holocene cooling. We suggest that the pool developed as secondary features influenced by short growing seasons, low accumulation rates, and wet conditions, which in turn affected the wettest microforms to shift into permanent pools. The differential response of microforms to shift in surface wetness shows the complexity of processes involved in pool initiation.

AB The water and substrate properties in the vegetation zones characteristic of the late stages of lake overgrowth were determined. It was demonstrated that the spatial distribution of plant communities conformed with the spatial gradient of habitat conditions. With regard to water properties the largest differences between the zones were found in Mg2+, Ca2+, electrolytic conductivity and NH4+. In the case of substrate the zones differed significantly in Ca2+ total Fe and organic matter content. The water properties varied greatly during the vegetative season in the successive zones. The temporal changes often proceeded at a different level of a given component or factor in most zones. The differences between the zones were, however, maintained. It appears that the plant communities can alter their habitats to a large extent. In the lake studied, the invasion of raised and transitional bog vegetation was observed. The process of dystrophy proceeded from the terrestrialized peripheral parts of the lake to the centre of the lake.

AB Regional analysis of bryophyte vegetation in 65 ombrogenous peatlands from across northern Alberta, are classified into eight vegetation groups based mainly on the dominance pattern of several Sphagnum species and on the occurrence of lichens. Using canonical correspondence analysis, bryophyte vegetation patterns are related to shade and dryness gradients. Surface water chemistry gradients are of less importance. Four ombrogenous landforms, two associated with present-day permafrost and two with areas not having present-day permafrost, are recognized; these are related to allogenic (climatic) factors. The landforms are influential in determining the shade and dryness of individual peatlands, and these two correlated autogenic factors largely control the bryophyte vegetation patterns. Surface water chemistry is less variable in continental bogs than in fens, and is less of a factor than in other wetlands.

AB The dominant plants of the Late Carboniferous lowland tropics were taxonomically and structurally distinct from those of any later time periods. Dominance was distributed among lycopsids, ferns, sphenopsids, pteridosperms and cordaites, and each of these groups had distinctive and different ecological preferences and amplitudes. Peat-forming habitats were dominated by lycopsids throughout the Westphalian, with a significant cordaitean element in the middle Westphalian; during the Stephanian tree ferns were dominant, following major extinctions near the Westphalian-Stephanian transition.
   Each of the major plant groups had distinctive architectures and tissue composition. Trees contributed up to 95% of the peat biomass and tree forms of lycopsids, Psaronius and Medullosa lack good modern analogues. The cordaites were the only woody plant group to contribute significantly to peat, and then only during the mid-Westphalian. Structurally wood-like lycopsid bark is the major ''woody'' tissue encountered in most Westphalian coals. Tree ferns and pteridosperms were largely parenchymatous in construction; the stigmarian root systems of lycopsids also were largely parenchymatous. The tissue structure of these dominant plants suggests the need for extreme caution in the inference of mire ecological conditions or vegetational structure from coal petrographic data. Peat formed under arborescent ferns or pteridosperms, or peat repeatedly exposed to decay and rerooting by stigmarian root systems of lycopsids, would have a distinctly non-woody signature and yet would have formed in a forested environment. A summary is presented of the autecology and synecology of mire plants, emphazing the structural framework provided by lycopsids during the Westphalian. Certain constraints in the links between peat biomass and miospore palynology are discussed in terms of over-representation, under-representation and non-representation. The formulation of Smith's four-phase hydroseral model is discussed and compared with more recent data available from plant paleoecology.
   The current debate over an ombrotrophic vs. rheotrophic origin of Late Carboniferous peats relies in large part on paleobotanical data, almost entirely palynological, in combination with petrographic analyses. Ecological studies of miospores and of coal-ball and compression macrofossils, and the linkage of miospores to source plants, permit the re-evaluation of mire successional models. Evidence for tree lycopsids, sphenopsids, pteridosperms and cordaites suggests growth mainly in rheotrophic mires. Tree ferns are likely candidates for growth in domed mires, although evidence is ambiguous and some tree ferns clearly grew under rheotrophic conditions. Densospores, produced by at least Sporangiostrobus lycopsid subtrees, have been considered diagnostic of ombrotrophic conditions; abundant evidence refutes this simplistic interpretation and suggests broad ecological amplitudes for densospore producers, including growth under rheotrophic conditions.
   Although plant fossils alone can not resolve most of the major debates in modern coal geology, paleobotany does contribute significantly to our understanding of ancient mires. An approach combining paleobotanical data with petrography, sedimentology and geochemistry, on a case by case basis, is most likely to produce a clear picture.

AB Drainage-driven changes in peatland ecosystems in Finland were studied, using aerial photographs taken in 1995 and 1946. The species composition of the vegetation cover was examined in one drained and one undrained mire in 1995. The data were correlated with tone and texture values of digitized colour infrared aerial photographs taken the same year, using canonical correspondence analysis. The results obtained were used to reconstruct the vegetation cover of the aerial photograph from 1946. The analysis clearly differentiated drained and undrained mire site types from each other, forming the moisture gradient in the first axis. The undrained mire site types were distributed along the nutrient gradient, but the correlation between site types and different tone values was relatively weak. The main difference between 1946 and 1995 was that the open and sparsely forested peatland vegetation types diminished and two drained mire site types (drained, pine-dominated Vaccinium type and drained, pine-dominated dwarf shrub type) became dominant. Digitized aerial photographs were unable to identify the vegetation at the mire site-type level, especially in natural habitats.

AB Fens belong to the most threatened ecosystems in Europe. Maintaining a high water table through rewetting is an effective measure to rehabilitate many of their ecosystem functions. However, the impact of meteorological conditions such as vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and precipitation on water tables is still unclear for rewetted fens. Here, we compare the impact of meteorological factors on water table dynamics in a drained and a rewetted fen, using multiple regression with data from continuous high-resolution (temporal) water level monitoring and weather stations. We find that an increase in the daily mean VPD causes a higher drop in the water table at the drained and degraded fen compared to the rewetted fen. Precipitation contributes to recharge, causing the water table to rise higher at the drained site than at the rewetted site. We attribute the differential influence of meteorological conditions on water table dynamics to different soil specific yield values (i.e., water storage capacity) largely driven by lower water table position at the drained site. Our study underlines the importance of understanding how and why water tables in peatlands vary in response to meteorological factors for management decisions (e.g., rewetting). Continuous monitoring of water table and vegetation development in rewetted fen peatlands is advisable to ensure long-term success especially under climate change conditions and associated drought events.

AB Recently, fen construction projects on surface mines in northeastern Alberta have been attempted as a reclamation strategy to reintroduce peatlands into the region where industry disturbs a substantial amount of wetland ecosystems. Knowledge of carbon cycling and greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics, including methane (CH4), is one way to understand the biogeochemical function of newly constructed fen ecosystems. In this study we monitored CH4 emissions and CH4 pore water concentration, as well as ecological and soil chemistry controls on CH4 emissions and pore water concentration, from a constructed fen. The same variables were also monitored at two natural reference fens that had similar vascular vegetation to the constructed fen. Methane emissions were lower at the constructed fen compared to the reference poor fen, but similar to the reference saline fen. However, CH4 concentration in pore water at 0.2 m and 0.7 m depth was lower at the constructed fen than either of the natural reference sites. The supply rate of sulfur (all mobile forms) was the most dominant control on CH4 emission and CH4 pore water concentration. While low CH4 emissions may be beneficial for constructed fens from a GHG perspective, this condition indicates that peat and carbon accumulation at these reclaimed sites may ensue slowly. Therefore, a clear statement of goals is required to determine how CH4 dynamics from constructed fen ecosystems relate to the reclamation outcome. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We compared the amount and composition of different aboveground biomass (BM) fractions of four mires with their net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) measured by eddy covariance. We found clear differences in response of green biomass (GBM) of plant functional types (PFTs) to water table (WT), which resulted in larger spatial variation in GBM within a mire than variation between mires. GBM varied between mires from 126 +/- 7 to 336 +/- 16 g.m(-2) (mean +/- SE), while within mire variation at largest was from 157 +/- 17 to 488 +/- 20 g.m(-2) (mean +/- SE). GBM of dominant PFTs appeared to be better in explaining the peak growing season NEE than the total BM or GBM of a mire. The differences in photosynthetic capacity between PTFs had a major role, and thus a smaller GBM with different species composition could result in higher NEE than larger GBM. Vascular plant GBM, especially that of sedges, appeared to have a high impact on NEE. Eleven PFTs, defined here, appeared to capture well the internal variation within mires, and the differences in GBM between communities were explained by the water table response of PFTs. Our results suggest the use of photosynthesizing BM, separated into PFTs, in modelling ecosystem carbon exchange instead of using just total BM.

AB Vegetation patterns in peatlands suggest autogenic peatland development and hydrological processes are controlling factors in peatland evolution. These processes regulate vegetation ordination by influencing pH and nutrient availability at the peat surface. Geophysical studies in Caribou Bog, a 2200-hectare peatland in central Maine, indicate a close correlation between underlying geologic deposits and dominant vegetation type. The location of pools within the bog also appears to be related to subsurface geologic materials. Electrical resistivity imaging along a 1 km transect across the central unit of Caribou Bog resolved underlying lake sediment and glacio-marine clay thickness, as well as variability in depth to glacial till. Ground penetrating radar precisely defined the organic-rich lake sediment, the glacio-marine interface, and elevated till surfaces where peat thickness is less than 10 m. Direct verification of peat and lake sediment thickness, in addition to samples of the glacio-marine and till deposits, constrained the geophysical interpretation. Wooded heath (WH) interspersed with occasional Sphagnum lawn occurs where lake sediment and glacio-marine clay accumulation is thickest. Abrupt thinning of both layers (such that peat rests directly on till in places) correlates with a sharp transition to shrub heath dominated vegetation. A major open pool area located within the WH coincides with a localized sandy mineral soil-lake sediment contact at the base of the bog. The geophysical data suggest the underlying double basin system influences peatland development and dictates vegetation patterning. Limited groundwater elevation data suggest that sub-organic sediment stratigraphy mapped with geophysics regulates water levels at the peat surface, exerting a control on vegetation patterning. The major pool area, located between the basins, appears to reflect isolation of stagnant water at a point where peat development is incomplete and thus suggests that pools exist concurrent with peatland formation.

AB To elucidate the impact of high nitrogen (N) deposition on intact bog vegetation, as affected by phosphorus (P) availability, we conducted a 4-year fertilization experiment with N and P at six sites, one with moderate N deposition and five with high N deposition. During the growing season, N (40 kg ha(-1) ya(-1)), P (3 kg ha(-1) y(-1)), or a combination of both elements was applied to the vegetation. The fertilization effects turned out to be additive in nature. Adding P decreased the inorganic N concentration and increased the P concentration in the rhizosphere at two sites. Furthermore, P stimulated Sphagnum growth and Sphagnum net primary productivity (NPP) at two sites; it also seemed to encourage growth at two other sites including the moderate-deposition site. Vascular plant growth remained largely unaffected but was depressed at one high-deposition site. Adding N increased the concentration of inorganic N in the rhizosphere at the moderate-deposition site and at two of the three high-deposition sites; vascular plant growth and litter production were encouraged at three high-deposition sites. The addition of N depressed Sphagnum height increment at four high deposition sites and reduced Sphagnum NPP at two sites. Shading by vascular plants was of minor importance in explaining the negative effects of N on Sphagnum. We conclude that because P alleviates the negative impact N has on Sphagnum by enhancing its capability to assimilate the deposited N, P availability is a major factor determining the impact of N deposition on Sphagnum production and thus on carbon sequestration in bogs.

AB The NIES integrated catchment-based eco-hydrology (NICE) model was expanded to include the vegetation succession processes in the Kucyoro River catchment, Japan (NICE-VEG). The NICE-VEG simulated the water/heat budget and dynamic vegetation processes iteratively. The simulation results indicated that the spatial occupation rate of alder invasion is positively correlated with hydrogeological changes. Some discrepancies are attributable to local heterogeneity of changes in groundwater level, porosity, deposited sediments, and other limiting factors (nutrients, soil moisture, light, temperature). Furthermore, simulation of channelized rivers showed that the recharge rate of Kushiro Mire decreases greatly. This indicates that channelization will also cause an increase of sedimentation/nutrient load and flooding in the downstream area around the mire. The NICE-VEG reproduced excellently the invasion of alder in the mire over the last 30 years, which represents a dramatic advance in our understanding of the drying phenomenon associated with alder invasion. The reproducibility of these simulation results suggests that the NICE-VEG includes some of the important factors affecting vegetation succession in Kushiro Mire. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Although methanogenic pathways generally produce equimolar amounts of carbon dioxide and methane, CO2 concentrations are often reported to be higher than CH4 concentrations in both field and laboratory incubation studies of peat decomposition. In field settings, higher pore water concentrations of CO2 may result from the loss of methane by: (1) ebullition due to the low solubility of methane in pore water and (2) vascular-plant transport. Higher CO2 concentrations may also be caused by: (1) production of additional CO2 by high-molecular weight (HMW) organic matter (OM) fermentation and/or (2) respiration from non-methanogenic pathways. In this study of a peatland where advection and transverse dispersion were the dominant pore water solute transport mechanisms, an isotope-mass balance approach was used to determine the proportions of CO2 formed from non-fractionating OM respiration and HMW fermentation relative to CO2 production from methanogenesis. This approach also allowed us to estimate the loss of CH4 from the belowground system. The pathways of CO2 production varied with depth and surface vegetation type. In a Carex-dominated fen, methane production initially produced 40 % of the total CO2 and then increased to 90-100 % with increasing depth. In a Sphagnum-dominated bog, methanogenesis resulted in 60 % of total CO2 production which increased to 100 % at depth. Both bogs and fens showed 85-100 % of methane loss from pore waters. Our results indicate that the isotopic composition of dissolved CO2 is a powerful indicator to allow partitioning of the processes affecting peat remineralization and methane production.

AB After fires in 1984 and 1989 at Whangamarino wetland, and in 1972 at Moanatuatua Bog, peatland flora and vegetation were monitored to determine rates and patterns of recovery. Species with rhizomes that survived the fires were able to resprout and grow rapidly in the initial post-fire period. Species that were eliminated had to re-establish from seed and so recovered more slowly. The vegetation at Moanatuatua took almost 12 years to recover to pre-fire condition, twice as long as at Whangamarino. Adventive and early colonising native species were prominent only in the first 1-2 post-fire years, probably because of temporarily increased availability of nutrients and/or open habitat. Ordination techniques arranged the plots and species in a sequence from shrub-sedgeland (Whangamarino), through Empodisma minus restiad rushland (Whangamarino), to Sporadanthus traversii/Empodisma restiad rushland (Moanatuatua) following a gradient of decreasing fertility with time. Fires reset the bog development process but generally do not alter the recovery pathways. In the absence of future major disturbance, including invasion by troublesome adventive species, the younger Whangamarino peatlands are expected to develop eventually into floristically poor, oligotrophic raised bogs similar to those at Moanatuatua and elsewhere in the Waikato district.

ID RADIOCARBON AGE CALIBRATION
AB The raised bog sediments that have been continuously accumulated over time represent the most suitable natural object which enables us to reconstruct Late Glacial and Holocene vegetation and palaeoclimates. Bog peat consists of organic carbon formed in situ. It contains moss, plant fragments and microfossils that are necessary for the study of palaeovegetation and palaeoclimate. However, a successful study of palaeoenvironment can be carried out on the basis of investigation of a great quantity of samples along the whole peatbog thickness. In the present paper, the authors present the results of palynological, botanical investigations and radiocarbon dating of 31 peat samples taken from the raised bog Velikoye, located in the eastern part of Kaliningrad Region. The data obtained have enabled us to reconstruct the palaeovegetation, reveal the evolution of the bog and determine rate of peat formation at different evolutional stages over the last 7500 cal BP.

AB Question: What is the nature and relative importance of compositional gradients within- and between fens?
   Location: Iowa, USA.
   Methods: 506 0.5 m x 0.5 m quadrats were sampled from 31 fens across a 550 km extent. Presence/absence of all vascular plant taxa, plus the non-vascular genera Sphagnum and Chara, and values for 24 environmental variables were noted. Global Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling and Monte Carlo tests were used to describe compositional variation and identify significant environmental co-variables. Model-based cluster analysis was used to identify the optimal number of groups supported by the data, while k-means clustering was used to assign each quadrat to a group. The number of occurrences (and frequency) of each species within each group was calculated. Two-dimensional 95% Gaussian confidence intervals, ANOVA, correlation coefficient homogeneity tests, log-linear modelling, and Fisher's exact tests were used to document patterns of compositional change.
   Results: Two stable axes of variation were identified: the first being most closely correlated with soil pH, Mg, Ca, P, S, vegetation height, surface and -10 cm soil temperature, site area, perimeter, perimeter/area ratio, growing season, and air temperature, with the second being most correlated to soil moisture, N, disturbance level, % organic matter, hummock height, N-S coordinate, and precipitation. Individual sites harboured between 20-47% of total compositional variation, with 28% of Axis 1 and 55% of Axis 2 scores being contained within-sites. Five compositional regions were identified that differed in the proportion of calciphile and hydrophile species. Compositional groups differed significantly between geologic types.
   Conclusions: While the principal axis of variation (corresponding to the rich-poor fen gradient) is present largely between sites, the second axis (corresponding to water level) is largely repeated within sites. Documentation and protection of vegetation patterns and species diversity within Iowa fens will thus require consideration of multiple sites across the landscape.

AB Research in the Northern Hemisphere shows the principal control on species distribution and abundance of testate amoebae to be local hydrology, which in ombrotrophic mires is linked directly to climate. Fossil faunas can therefore be used to infer past hydrological and climatic conditions. This study investigates whether a similar relationship can be found for New Zealand peatlands, as a first step towards developing a method for palaeomoisture reconstructions. Fifty-seven samples from 13 peatlands were analysed for testate amoebae and related to site hydrology, pH and conductivity of mire waters, climate, and vegetation type using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Water table and soil moisture were the dominant factors, and their relationship with species assemblage was modelled using four transfer functions: weighted averaging (WA), tolerance downweighted weighted averaging (WA-Tol), partial least squares (PLS), and weighted average partial least squares (WA-PLS). PLS and WA-PLS performed best, and suggest that palaeohydrology could be accurately inferred from fossil faunas. Results are contrasted with those found in the northern peatlands.

AB In a species-rich poor fen (Caricetum nigrae) and a species-poor drained fen, the difference in nutrient limitation of the vegetation was assessed in a full-factorial fertilization experiment with N, P and K. The results were compared to the nutrient ratios of plant material and to chemical analysis of the topsoil. A rewetting experiment with intact sods was carried out in the glasshouse and the results are discussed in view of restoration prospects of drained and degraded peatlands. In the undrained poor fen the above-ground biomass yield was N-limited while the vegetation of the drained fen was K-limited. Experimental rewetting of intact turf samples, taken in the drained site, did not change the biomass yield or the type of nutrient limitation. It was concluded that mire systems which have been subjected to prolonged drainage are inclined to pronounced K-deficiency, probably due to washing out of potassium and harvesting the standing crop. This may hamper restoration projects in degraded peat areas where nature conservation tries to restore species-rich vegetation types with a high nature value.

AB Using multivariate analysis, we created a hierarchical modeling process that describes how differently-scaled environmental factors interact to affect wetland-scale plant community organization in a system of small, isolated wetlands on Mount Desert Island, Maine. We followed the procedure: 1) delineate wetland groups using cluster analysis, 2) identify differently scaled environmental gradients using non-metric multidimensional scaling, 3) order gradient hierarchical levels according to spatiotemporal scale of fluctuation, and 4) assemble hierarchical model using group relationships with ordination axes and post-hoc tests of environmental differences. Using this process, we determined 1) large wetland size and poor surface water chemistry led to the development of shrub fen wetland vegetation, 2) Sphagnum and water chemistry differences affected fen vs. marsh/sedge meadows status within small wetlands, and 3) small-scale hydrologic differences explained transitions between forested vs. non-forested and marsh vs. sedge meadow vegetation. This hierarchical modeling process can help explain how upper level contextual processes constrain biotic community response to lower-level environmental changes. It creates models with more nuanced spatiotemporal complexity than classification and regression tree procedures. Using this process, wetland scientists will be able to generate more generalizable theories of plant community organization, and useful management models.

AB We investigated the mycorrhizal status of the dominant vascular plant species occurring in ten peatlands along a bog-fen-marsh gradient in southern boreal Alberta in 1997. All members of the Ericaceae were ericoid mycorrhizal, and members of the Salicaceae and Pinaceae were ectomycorrhizal. Also, some members of the Salicaceae and Betulaceae were simultaneously ecto- and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM). Fruiting bodies of the known ectomycorrhizal fungal genera Cortinarius, Lactarius, and Russula were collected in late fall. Furthermore, the cosmopolitan ectomycorrhizal taxon Cenococcum geophilum was associated with trees and shrubs in all fens and bogs. VA-mycorrhizal fungi were not found in any of the dominant herbaceous plant species in these peatlands; however, vesicles suggesting the presence of VAM fungi were found in Calamagrostis canadensis in the riverine marsh and Rubus chamaemorus in the bog. Neither Carer species in fens and marshes, nor Typha latifolia in the lacustrine mycorrhizal; however, microsclerotia, sclerotial plaques, septate, aseptate, and clamped hyphae were observed to grow on and within cortical cells of their roots. Many of these hyphae were dematiaceous and may belong to the Mycelium radicis atrovirens complex (MRA), partially consisting of the endophytic fungal genera Phialocephala and Leptodotidium. Hyphae resembling Rhizoctonia were also observed, although definitive identifications were nor attempted. The ecological significance of MRA genera remains largely unknown. Thus, the dominant vegetation in southern boreal bogs and fens is mycorrhizal, possibly enabling these plant species to proliferate in these nutrient-poor ecosystems by accessing otherwise unavailable nutrient pools. In contrast, marsh vegetation is generally non-mycorrhizal, possibly due to higher surface-water nutrient concentrations and fluctuating water levels.

AB Question: Can the biodiversity of fens in Europe and North America be maintained through the use of grazing (especially cattle grazing), fire, and/or cutting?
   Location: European and North American fens.
   Methods: This paper is a review of the literature on the effects of grazing, fire and cutting on fens, to explore the relationship between management and biodiversity in fens.
   Results: A reduction of cattle grazing, mowing and burning in fens has led to a reduction in biodiversity in fens. The vegetation of abandoned fens shifts to trees and shrubs after 10-15 years, which shade the smaller and rarer species of these wetlands. While careful use of fire is used to manage fens in North America, it is not widely used in European fens, perhaps because the peat of drained fens may catch fire. Cattle grazing cannot be considered a natural disturbance in North America, since cattle did not evolve on that continent. In Europe, cattle do not generally graze in unaltered fens, but they do use slightly drained fen meadows.
   Conclusions: Three approaches have been used to control the dominance of tall woody and herbaceous species in abandoned fens, including the re-introduction of cattle, mowing, and burning. Overgrazing results in a permanent reduction in biodiversity, therefore cattle re-introduction must be approached cautiously. In Europe, but not in North America, mowing has been an important management tool, and mowing has been successful in maintaining species richness, particularly in fens that have been mowed annually for centuries. Fire has been the most common and successful management tool in North America although it is not effective in removing shrubs that have become large. Because the problems and solutions are similar, the literature of both European and North American fen management can be analyzed to better assess the management of fens on both continents. Many management questions require further study and these are listed in the paper.

AB Large-scale changes in climate may have many unexpected effects on ecosystems, given the importance of climate as a control over almost all ecosystem attributes and their many internal feedbacks. In particular, the interactions among energy flux, plant dynamics, and soil carbon and nutrient cycling are poorly known. In this study, we examined biotic controls over soil temperature and evapotranspiration (ET) in a climate change experiment in two peatlands, a bog and a fen. Bogs are isolated from groundwater inputs (i.e., ombrogenous) and are acidic, whereas fens receive groundwater inputs (i.e., minerogenous) and are more alkaline. They also have many associated differences in soil chemistry, nutrient availability, and plant communities.
   We removed 27 intact peat monoliths each from a bog and a fen in northern Minnesota to construct a large mesocosm facility that allows for direct manipulation of climatic variables in a replicated experimental design. The treatment design was a fully crossed factorial with three infrared-loading treatments, three water table treatments, and two ecosystem types (bogs and fens), with three replicates of all treatment combinations. Heating was achieved with overhead infrared lamps, so soil temperature was a dependent variable.
   Increased infrared loading caused mean monthly soil temperature to increase by 1.6 degrees-4.1 degrees C at 15 cm depth during the growing season (May-October). The soil temperature response was strongly seasonal, with much greater effects during the growing season than during the winter. Within the growing season, heating caused greater increases in soil temperature in May-June in the bog plots and in May-June and September-October in the fen plots. Occasionally during the winter, increased infrared loading cooled the soil by up to 5.1 degrees C, probably due to melting of the insulating snow cover. Fen plots were on average 0.8 degrees-1.0 degrees C warmer than bog plots during the growing season, although bog plots had a steeper soil temperature gradient with depth. Water level had no effect on soil temperature.
   Annual ET was 12-23% greater in the bog plots than in the fen plots, at least partially explaining the cooler soil temperatures in the bog plots due to latent heat of evaporation. Additionally, warmer, wetter conditions increased ET. In the fen plots, ET was more sensitive to water table depth than in the bog plots. Differences in the composition and seasonality of the plant canopies accounted for much of the observed differences in ET between bog and fen mesocosms, and hence soil temperature. We present a conceptual model of how above- and belowground ecosystem processes control energy fluxes in northern peatlands and suggest that such controls represent a general phenomenon that should be incorporated into climate change models that include biotic feedbacks.

AB To assess whether raised bog restoration measures contribute to the conservation and restoration of the fauna diversity, macroinvertebrate species assemblages were compared between water bodies created by rewetting measures and water bodies which have not been subject to restoration measures, but are remnants of former peat cuttings and trenches used for buckwheat culture in the past. The restoration sites were inhabited by characteristic raised bog species and rare species, but their numbers were higher at the remnant sites not affected by restoration management. A considerable number of characteristic and rare fauna species were only found at the remnant sites. The remnant sites included considerably more variation in macroinvertebrate species assemblages and had a higher cumulative species richness. The number of characteristic macroinvertebrate species was not clearly related to the presence of a characteristic raised bog vegetation. In restoration sites numbers of rare and characteristic species per site tended to increase with the time elapsed after rewetting. However, restoration measures will not automatically result in restoration of a more or less complete macroinvertebrate species spectrum, as restoration measures have so far resulted in habitats for only a limited number of the characteristic species. When planning restoration measures, it is recommended to protect the populations of rare and characteristic species present in the area, as these populations may become the sources for colonization of rewetted sites. Safeguarding habitat diversity during the restoration process and restoration of different elements of the habitat diversity of complete raised bog systems will result in the characteristic fauna diversity being conserved and restored more successfully.

AB The influence of pre-industrial animal husbandry on the boreal forest in south-central Sweden has been studied by pollen and charcoal analyses of peat profiles from two mires in the vicinity of a shieling site. The impact of farming on the local vegetation development is demonstrated from cal. A.D. 1300-1500 in three ways: forest clearance and cultivation of cereals at the local shieling site; alterations of hydrology and vegetation, such as an increase in Cyperaceae, at mires used for hay production; changes in the composition in the surrounding forest, with decreasing proportions of Betula, Picea and boreo-nemoral broadleaved trees and a consequent increase in Pinus, due to grazing and a change of fire regime. Similar alterations to the forest vegetation are noted at other sites in central and northern Sweden during the last thousand years, when the system of using shielings became more widespread. Hence, early animal husbandry is demonstrated to have had a regional impact on the long-term boreal forest development, replacing the original mixed deciduous-coniferous forest with Pinus dominated forest.

AB Calcareous springs support bryophyte-dominated habitats relevant to biodiversity and conservation, but not much is known about the ecology of vascular plants restricted to these environments. Here, we investigate vegetation and hydrogeological patterns within the distribution of Centaurium somedanum, a threatened vascular plant endemic to mountain calcareous springs in the Cantabrian range (Spain). We studied the hydrogeological characteristics of the spring systems where this species occurs and identified three types of springs: (a) springs with active travertine deposition in small valleys, (b) springs in rock fall avalanches and (c) springs fed by calcareous water close to geological faults. Vascular plants and bryophytes co-occurring with the study species were sampled in 1-m(2) plots to identify major vegetation types and to assess the relationships between species composition and topography. The presence of C. somedanum was associated with vegetation of calcareous spring fens (Caricion davallianae) in geological faults, tufa concretions (Adiantion) in active travertines, and another vegetation type of calcareous flushes (Pinguiculion) that was found in all of the spring types. C. somedanum shows a wider ecological range than other vascular plants of calcareous springs, occupying micro-habitats with similar cover of bryophytes but different from the cover of vascular plants. Although these plant communities are primarily dependent on the hydrology of springs, the variation in species composition is also correlated to the slope and solar radiation at the micro-scale. Our study demonstrates how a vascular plant with a calciphilic character may adapt to tufa-forming niches along the spring-flush-fen gradient, thus allowing it to occupy a wide range of habitats at different altitudes and geohydrological conditions.

AB Peatlands are long-term sinks of atmospheric carbon (C) largely due to water-saturated soil conditions, decay-resistant plant litter, and the presence of biochemical compounds such as soluble phenolics. As phenolics are known inhibitors of microbial enzymes in soils, the concept of the 'enzymic latch' on peat C was introduced, assuming that phenolics accumulate in peat water due to protection from degradation by oxidative enzymes as a result of anoxia. However, their inhibitory role in peat has not been unambiguously confirmed.
   We aimed to verify whether peat phenolics inhibit microbial and enzyme activities in laboratory-incubated Sphagnum litter, and bog and fen peat. Soluble humic substances were extracted from bog water as a source of natural phenolics and separated into two molecular-weight fractions. We tested the effects of (1) phenolics concentration, (2) their molecular weight and (3) anoxia on the activity of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes, and on microbial respiration rate.
   The added phenolics did not suppress hydrolytic enzyme activities nor microbial respiration. Quite the contrary, phenolics addition (up to 1000 mg L-1) sometimes supported enzyme and microbial activities, indicating that phenolics (or another constituent of peat humic substances) served as a source of C. The activities of hydrolytic enzymes did not vary between oxic and anoxic peat but were double in oxic than anoxic conditions in Sphagnum litter. Differences in enzymatic and microbial activities were driven by peat type with about three times greater microbial respiration rates and enzyme activities in fen peats.
   Our results do not support the concept of the enzymic latch, particularly its key assumption that peat phenolics inhibit hydrolytic enzymes. While the concept was established on oceanic peatlands with low phenolic concentrations, the peat microbial community in our experiments seemed acclimated to the naturally high phenolic concentrations, characteristic for other, non-oceanic northern peatlands. Thus, the enzymic latch should not be considered as a determinative mechanism preserving the global C store in peatlands. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We studied the effects of increasing levels of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition on nutrient limitation of ombrotrophic Sphagnum plants.
   Fifteen mires in 11 European countries were selected across a natural gradient of bulk atmospheric N deposition from 0.1 to 2 g/m(2) year(-1). Nutritional constraints were assessed based on nutrient ratios of N, phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in Sphagnum plants collected in hummocks (i.e. relatively drier microhabitats) and in lawns (i.e. relatively wetter microhabitats).
   Nutrient ratios in Sphagnum plants increased steeply at low atmospheric N input, but above a threshold of N deposition of c. 1 g/m(2) year(-1) the N : P and N : K ratios tended to saturation. Increasing atmospheric N deposition was also accompanied by a reduced retention of Ca and Mg in Sphagnum plants and a decreased stem volumetric density in hummock Sphagnum plants.
   We suggest a critical load of N deposition in Europe of 1 g/m(2) year(-1) above which Sphagnum plants change from being N-limited to be K + P colimited, at N : P > 30 and N : K > 3.

ID BOG; VEGETATION; HISTORY
AB A new species, Sporadanthus ferrugineus (Restionaceae), is described from the peat bogs of the northern North Island, New Zealand. It is distinguished from S. traversii by its more robust, brittle culms with swollen bases, different coloured rhizome scales and culms, and smaller, dehiscent fruit. In the past S. ferrugineus has been referred to Sporadanthus traversii, which is now treated as a Chatham Island endemic. Because of this past confusion a detailed description for S. traversii is also provided and a lectotype for the species selected. The ecology of both species of Sporadanthus is reviewed. There are marked differences in their preferred habitats and response to fire. In particular, Sporadanthus ferrugineus is a late-successional species of raised peat bogs. Within these ecosystems, S. ferrugineus is eliminated by fire and re-establishment is from seed subsequently deposited by remnant plants. Following fire, S ferrugineus takes five years to recolonise former habitat and requires 12 years or more to re-establish itself fully within the peat bog vegetation. Sporadanthus traversii is less specialised, colonising a variety of mid- to late-successional peat habitats on the Chatham Islands, as well as coastal cliff scarps, peaty dune hollows, and lake margins. Although S. traversii is also eliminated by fire, it can re-establish itself through activation of dormant seed within a few months of a fire. The possibility that S. traversii has become more common as a result of increased fire frequency on the Chatham Islands is discussed.

AB Species-rich plant communities characteristic for succession from mesotrophic open water to fen are very rare in The Netherlands. These vegetation types used to occur in turf ponds in the low lying peatland area, created by pear dredging and filled with water due to seepage of mesotrophic, well-buffered groundwater. One of the goals of the National Nature Policy Plan is to create new opportunities for the initial terrestrialization communities through ecological engineering, e.g., restoration and creation of open water habitats. Restoration of the abiotic conditions in acidified floating fen communities is only possible by a combined measure of removal of the Sphagnum-layer and superficial drainage of surplus rain water. New turfponds have been excavated. This study showed that the abiotic conditions (i.e., water depth and water chemistry) are favorable for the development of aquatic communities characteristic of mesotrophic conditions. The aquatic plant species found in the new ponds also point in this direction, e.g., Chara major and Ch. delicatula are very abundant as are seven Potamogeton species. It is concluded that a constant discharge of groundwater and a good connectivity between the ponds and the existing remnants of plant communities desired in the area are essential for the conservation and development of these species-rich plant communities.

AB Ongoing climate warming threatens the survival of bogs at the warm/dry limit of their distribution (e.g. in central Europe), and jeopardises the restoration of damaged bogs even more. Because vegetation changes can be slow, early indicators of hydrological change such as testate amoebae are useful. We used testate amoeba community structure and community weighted mean of functional traits to monitor the impact of two very hot and dry summers on a small (around 100 m(2)) artificial peatland constructed in the botanic garden of Neuchatel, Switzerland. We collected analogous samples in a naturally regenerating cutover peatland at 1000 m a.s.l. in the Jura Mountains as a reference. The comparison of living and dead assemblages in the botanic garden showed an increased representation of smaller testate amoeba taxa (Corythion dubium, small Euglypha sp.) with a small pseudostome (indicative of dry conditions) and a loss of mixotrophy in 2015, followed by a weaker further shift in 2016. Nevertheless, the testate amoeba community structure in 2016 still indicated a dry Sphagnum bog. Testate amoeba analysis allows rapid assessment of peatland health and/or restoration success. The comparison of living and dead assemblages makes it possible to observe changes within a season in a single sampling campaign.

AB In the Athabasca Oil Sands Region of the Western Boreal Plain mining companies now recognize the importance of reclaiming peatlands, as they cover >50% of the pre-mined regional landscape. To date, reclamation efforts have focused on marsh and open water wetlands. However, these wetland systems are not abundant in the sub-humid climate of the WBP because of their excessive evapotranspiration (ET) losses, compared to peatland wetlands. The experimental Nikanotee Fen was constructed as part of the landscape reclamation, engineered with the intent to support natural fen vegetation and hydrologic processes. The influences of vegetation and treatment types on plot-scale energy fluxes and ET demands were examined over the 2014 growing season, one year post-construction. Actual ET and environmental variables, such as water table, soil moisture, temperature and relative humidity, were monitored in thirty-one study plots comprising control, moss and seedling plots (with and without wood-strand mulch), as well as three ponds. Actual ET was measured with weighing lysimeters and used to correct equilibrium ET, calculated using the Priestley-Taylor combination method. A roaming meteorological station was instrumented to quantify and compare available energy over different cover types. Modeled plot-scale ET was validated against continuously measured eddy covariance ET values. Cumulative ET exceeded precipitation in all plot types with average rates of 4.4, 3.2, 3.9 and 2.8 mm/day from open water, control, seedling and moss plots, respectively. Mulch reduced ET rates in both seedling and moss plots, where moss-mulch plots showed the lowest rates (2.4mm/day). The presence of mulch lowered the near-surface vapour pressure deficit, thus providing a more favorable microclimate for moss establishment by elevating near-surface relative humidity and reducing air and soil temperature by similar to 2 degrees C. Although vapour pressure deficit did not significantly control ET (p > 0.05), mulch appeared to have a greater influence on ET in moss plots than seedling plots. Water table position displayed a weak yet significant (p <0.05) control on ET in seedling plots. As these reclamation practices have not yet been well tested in the Alberta oil sands region; this study provides recommendations to reduce evaporative stress and aid in the establishment of functioning constructed peatland ecosystems.

AB Mire terminology, subdivision and gradient structure have been subjected to an intense debate intensified in the last years. The conception of Wheeler and Proctor (J. Ecol. 88, 187-203), which divides mires into bogs, having pH < 5.5, and fens, having pH > 5.5, becomes generally accepted despite a certain critique from the Scandinavian perspective and despite the fact that few contributions to the debate have come from central and southern Europe and from other than botanical disciplines. In this paper, we demonstrated that the bog-fen boundary is clearly determinable not by pH, but by a set of nutrient-requiring species that avoid truly ombrotrophic conditions in central Europe. We therefore defined fens as groundwater-fed wetlands Thai host low productive nutrient-limited vegetation dominated by Cyperaceae and bryophytes. The fertility gradient within fens, another controversial point in the ongoing debate, is easily distinguishable using both plant and animal data, but it appears primarily within calcium-richer fens. We suggest defining fen grasslands by the high abundance of nutrient-requiring grasses and forbs rather than purely by fen origin and management. Concerning pH/calciurn gradient, there is large variation in plant, mollusc, algal, fungal and testacean assemblages within fens with a pH > 5.5 in central Europe even though some authors named all mires having such pH '(rich) fens'. This clear and extended poor-rich (pH/calciurn) gradient in floristical data is independent of the fertility gradient. Conductivity (approximating water mineral richness) contributes significantly to the pH in explaining the vegetation variation. Vegetation composition accounts for a larger amount of the variation in algal, molluscan. testacean and fungal assemblages than even long-term measured environmental data. The chemical limit of the occurrence of any Sphagnum species, wen the calcitolerant ones, is the most important and easily recognised natural boundary between major functional fen types, although it varies among regions and hydrological situations. We therefore believe that fen classification based exclusively on floristical data is necessary to avoid circular argumentation and provides the best basis for the characterization of habitats. We propose to subdivide fens into five standard vegetation types with defined boundaries: poor fens (Sphagno recurvi-Caricion canescentis), moderately rich fens (Caricion fuscae), rich fens (Sphagno warnstorfii-Tomenthypnion), extremely rich fens and calcareous fens (both corresponding to Caricion davallianae). Calcareous fens were neglected during the ongoing debate due to its relative scarcity in some traditionally explored regions. Its ecological boundary is the point at which calcium carbonate starts to precipitate. which is connected with marked change in plant and animal species composition. The ecological differentiation of all proposed fen types was tested using a data set from two different regions (Carpathians and Bulgaria). Both conductivity and pH differ significantly between pairs of vegetation types. All proposed fen types also markedly differ in molluscan assemblages. (c) 2006 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich.

TI Classification and distribution of freshwater peatlands in Maine
SO NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST

ID ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS; RAISED BOGS; VEGETATION; HABITAT
AB This classification of Maine's freshwater organic wetlands (peatlands) uses nutrient source, geomorphic-hydrologic setting, gross topography of the peat mass, micro topographic pattern, and presence of pools for distinguishing peatland types. We apply these primarily hydro-geomorphological criteria to landscape units called peatland complexes. Vegetation, while important at lower levels of classification and for the description of individual peatlands, is not used in this classification because, typically, all but the smallest peatland complexes in Maine have major areas of differing vegetational physiognomies and types. This classification resembles the peatland division of Canada's current wetland classification more than the classification in most common use in the United States because a large percentage of Maine peatlands are northern in character.
   Our classification contains eight peatland types. Two of these are divided into two subtypes. Only one of the types has unique floristic and vegetational elements: plateau (coastal) bog. Large Maine peatlands typically contain multiple complexes, commonly of more than one type. We use the term multiple-unit peatland for these multiple complexes. Our classification and survey of the distribution of peatland types in Maine is based on a large representative sample of peatlands. We conducted an air photo survey of similar to1100 peatlands throughout the state, observed a representative subset of 171 of these from aircraft at low altitude, and studied a representative subset of 100 of the 171 on the ground. However, to classify a peatland using our system, only air photo study or aerial observation is needed.
   The distribution of peatland types in Maine is controlled by gradients of topography, geological substrate, climate, and hydrology. Peatlands are least abundant in the well-drained western uplands. Unpatterned fens occur throughout Maine, hundreds of the smaller ones (similar to<10 ha) occur in ice-block depressions (kettles). Five types, all of which also occur in Canada, reach their eastern North American southern limits in Maine: ribbed (string) fens at 45degreessimilar to30'N, eccentric bogs at 45degreessimilar to10'N, domed bogs with concentric pattern at 44degreessimilar to45'N, plateau bogs at 44degreessimilar to15'N. and gently convex bogs at 43degreessimilar to20'N. These latitudinal limits exclude individual southern outliers). Distributions of peatland types in adjacent areas of New Hampshire and Canada are consistent with those in Maine. We propose that the geographic position of Maine along a steep south (coastal) to north (inland) climatic gradient and a less-steep west-southwest to east-northeast climatic gradient paralleling the coast are the major factors accounting for the diverse representation of peatland types in so limited an area.

AB A revision of the Spanish helophytic vegetation combining phytosociological data and multivariate analysis was carried out. Classification analysis (UPGMA with similarity ratio) was used in order to assess how the associations are organised into groups within the class. The hierarchical clustering established a first separation between a group constituted by sedges and tall-herb fen vegetation, developed on base-rich substrates and mainly distributed throughout the Eastern half of the Iberian peninsula, and another group constituted by sedges and tall-herb fens developed on base-poor substrates distributed mainly throughout the Western half of the Iberian peninsula, as well as other water margin vegetation (forbs and low mats). The relationships of the communities type to complex environmental gradients were analysed using Detrended Correspondence Analysis. In this case, the associations have been related with phytosociological orders in physiognomic groups. The ordination analysis showed that floristic composition and community structure are controlled primarily by edaphic aspects such as the organic content and nutrient status of the substrate.

AB Little information exists about the ecological determinants of the mollusc species composition of Scandinavian fens. Therefore, we investigated water chemistry, hydrology, climate and vegetation composition of fens in southern and central Norway and in Sweden hosting mollusc assemblages. According to the results of the MDS ordination, variation in the mollusc composition was related to the hydrology of the studied sites, reflecting a transition from soligenous to topogenous fens. The second axis of the MDS reflected a complex gradient of mineral richness and climatic conditions. By analogy, cluster analysis revealed three main groups of sites, i.e. topogenous fens characterized by a frequent occurrence of Vertigo lilljeborgi, soli-genous lowland fens characterized by Cochlicopa lubrica and Nesovitrea hammonis, and soligenous highland fens characterized by Columella columella. Results of the RDA closely resembled those of the MDS, suggesting that the selected explanatory variables defined mollusc assemblages well.

AB In addition to some of the most southerly peat bogs in Europe, Slovenia also has some spruce mires. In general, these are transitional bogs with a mixture of ombrotrophic and minerotrophic elements. The vegetation of the spruce mires and the surrounding ecosystems was examined on the Pokljuka plateau in the north-western part of Slovenia.
   In accordance with the heterogeneous site conditions we found different types of vegetation. We found some spruce forests with Sphagnum mosses (Sphagno girgensohnii-Piceetum var. geogr. Carex brizoides) on supposedly autochthonous sites. The edges of the mires melded into the serried spruce forest (Rhytidiadelpho lorei-Piceetum). In the centre of the mires we found Sphagno-Pinetum mugo or other vegetation: Sphagno-Caricetum rostratae s. lat. and the plant communities where Carer davalliana Sm. or Trichophorum alpinum (L.) Pers. dominated. We also found some transitional types.
   Because of the harsh conditions both the height and radial growth of the spruce trees on mire sites are very slow and variable. Differences between the group means of spruce height and diameter were significant.

AB 1 We tested the influence of geographical gradients upon nutrient dynamics in the root environment of the vegetation of mires in north-eastern Poland and the Netherlands. The study areas show differences in the water level fluctuations, and atmospheric nitrogen deposition (the Netherlands, 50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1); Poland, 5-10 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)).
   2 Nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization, decomposition, denitrification and nitrous oxide emission were studied during 6 weeks in May-June and correlated with characteristics of the interstitial water and the soil. Five types of mires (herbaceous bog, forested bog, herbaceous rich-fen, river marginal fen and alder fen forest) were compared.
   3 Inorganic N as well as P release were faster in the Dutch than in the Polish mires of the same type. Denitrification and nitrous oxide emission were also faster in the Dutch mires, with the exception of the Polish alder forest, where denitrification was high because of high N richness and a strongly falling water table.
   4 Principal component analysis of 18 physical and chemical soil and interstitial water variables resulted in four components: I, 'soil redox status'; II, 'soil base status'; III, 'interstitial water nutrient richness'; IV, 'soil P richness'. In multiple regressions, N mineralization correlated positively with component III, P release with components III and IV, and cellulose decomposition with components II and IV. Both denitrification and nitrous oxide emission correlated positively with components I and II.
   5 It was concluded that the lower P release rates in the Polish compared to the Dutch mires were due to higher calcium levels and lower summer water tables, which was partly attributed to the Polish continental climate. The higher rates for N mineralization, denitrification, nitrous oxide emission and cellulose decomposition in the Dutch sites were attributed to the high N deposition in the Netherlands.

ID BOG DEVELOPMENT; SWEDEN; CANADA
AB Sediment-stratigraphical techniques, together with radiocarbon dating, are applied in this paper to basal peat sequences of Lammansmossen, a sloping mire-complex in southwestern Finland, to reconstruct patterns of peat initiation within the pearland, and by inference, changes in environmental conditions. Peat accumulation commenced simultaneously over the whole lower-lying area of the drainage path about 4500 cal BP, and progressed rapidly by paludification in an upslope direction. By ca 3000 cal BP. about 70% of the present mire area was buried by peat, and the mire received its current configuration 2000 years ago. It is concluded that the rapid replacement of the forest by peatland vegetation occurred mainly in response to a climate change towards humid conditions at 4500 cal BP, although other complex driving mechanisms were operating as well. This interpretation is consistent with findings from other peatlands in southern Finland, as well as a growing body of evidence from other sources.

AB Non-biting midges are one of the most diverse and abundant aquatic insects in peatlands. The Rabien mire is a raised bog located on the edge of the Lodz Agglomeration in Central Poland. After peat extraction, many ponds remained in the Rabien area. During the growing season in 2012, adult chironomids were collected by a light trap and a hand net near one of the excavation ponds. The phenology of adult flight period was documented from April to November. Thirty-one species were recorded and assigned to one of five phenology groups. Three parameters reflecting duration of daytime and weather conditions, i.e. air temperature, air humidity, were found to covary significantly with the observed flight periods. Taxa emerging in the spring may be classified as cold-adapted and those collected in the summer only as preferring higher air temperature. Emergence in late summer was related to a shorter duration of daytime.

   POCOSINS
AB Soil chemistry and hydrology gradients are closely associated with and have often been cited as the causative agents for changes in wetland plant community composition. We analyzed the biogeochemistry and hydrology of three freshwater peatland communities on the North Carolina Coastal Plain-short pocosins, tall pocosins, and gum swamps. We compare this community gradient to the classical bog-fen gradient of northern peatlands. Short pocosins, in the ombrotrophic center of the raised bog complex, have the highest summer water table, with a large part of the peat profile remaining anaerobic throughout the year. They are highly nutrient-deficient with low levels of total and extractable P, N, and basic cations. They additionally have the greatest peat depth, with an organic matter content of ca. 95%. Tall pocosins have a highly seasonal water table, shallower peat depth, low soil nutrient levels, and an average soil organic matter content from 76 to 93% in the top 30 cm. Gum swamp forests have a highly seasonal water table and the shallowest peat depth. They are the most minerotrophic community, based on low organic matter and high N and P content of the soil, but have low levels of exchangeable Ca and Mg and low percent base saturation. All communities had low soil pH (< 4). Short pocosins and tall pocosins were effectively differentiated by seasonal hydrology and peat depth but not by soil characteristics, while the pocosins and swamp forest had large differences in seasonal hydrology, peat depth, percent organic matter, and soil nutrients.
   This community gradient contrasts sharply with the bog-fen gradient of northern peatlands, in which there is an increase in soil pH, basic cations, percent base saturation, and ash content, and a decrease in extractable N, P, and K. This biogeographical comparison suggests a need for further study of the nutrients likely to control plant growth in peatlands (i.e., P, N, and K), in addition to the historical emphasis on basic cations and pH.

AB Pollen and macroscopic analyses of two Upper Holocene spring fen sites in the vicinity of the Turcek village in the south-western foothills of the Kremnicke vrchy Mts (central Slovakia) revealed new and unique information on the precultural and natural climazonal forests, and the origin and development of local meadow fen vegetation. Pollen-analytical data indicate the prevalence of natural spruce (Picea abies) and fir (Abies alba) forests in this region. The mixed beech forests depicted on the geobotanical map of Slovakia must have, therefore occupied much smaller areas than previously thought. After human colonization of the region during the 13th and 14th centuries natural forests were transformed mainly into grasslands and pastures, and to a lesser extent into arable fields. These changes were connected with gold and silver mining in the vicinity of the nearby town of Kremnica, with Turcek one of the important areas producing timber for the mining industry. The development of these fen mires is also connected with deforestation and transformation of the landscape. They originated as forest springs but after human colonization of the area they were transformed into treeless fen meadows by the direct or indirect effect of man cutting of trees, grazing livestock and mowing.

ID GRASSLANDS
AB An important component of many fens is large mounds created by ants, for nesting purposes. Because these mounds differ in microtopography, hydrology, and soil characteristics from the surrounding fell, they have the potential to strongly influence fell vegetation. This study examined the effects of ant mounds oil plant cover and species composition in two vegetation types within a Michigan prairie fen complex. Vegetation was sampled oil ant mounds and in control plots in sedge meadow and shrub carr vegetation types. Total plant cover was significantly greater oil ant mounds than in control plots in the sedge meadow, hilt significantly lower on ant mounds than in control lots in the shrub carr. plants varied in their response to ant mounds as a function of their wetland indicator status. Both facultative upland and facultative species occurred more frequently oil mounds, whereas obligate wetland species were more common in control plots. There was no significant difference for facultative wetland species. Plant life form also strongly influenced patterns of distribution Oil mounds vs. control plots. with grasses occurring more frequently oil mounds. and forbs and sedges occurring less frequently oil mounds than in control areas. Thus. especially in the sedge meadow. ant mounds provide an important refuge for species more adapted to dry conditions.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE

AB Peatlands are an important component of the global carbon cycle because they comprise huge amounts of terrestrial carbon (C). Different conditions during peat formation and secondary peat decomposition affect the quantity and composition of soil organic matter (SOM) in peats. There are few comparative studies on the chemical composition of SOM in temperate peatland soil. This study investigates compositional changes of SOM functional groups in peats and corresponding peat-forming plants by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Three plant samples and 29 peat samples were taken from seven temperate peatland sites with different genesis and land-use intensity. Site-specific differences, such as genesis of the peat, were found to be reflected in the FTIR spectra. In general, there was more variation in FTIR spectra in samples from fens than in those from bogs and peat-forming plants. The samples from fens have a smaller C-H absorption band than those from bogs and plants, which reflects greater biochemical activity in the minerotrophic than ombrotrophic environments. In addition to peat genesis, drainage and secondary peat decomposition also affect SOM composition substantially. The larger amounts of aliphatic compounds in undrained peats could be explained by selective preservation caused by anaerobic conditions. With increasing drainage of the sites, there was a decrease in the C-H absorption that was accompanied by a relative increase in C=O absorption. These changes in absorption intensities reflect the enhanced aerobic decomposition and mineralization that accompanies drainage and land-use intensity. However, the degree of peat decomposition', a diagnostic tool used in the field, is not reflected by OM composition determined by FTIR spectroscopy. Our results contribute to further understanding of changes in SOM composition during peat formation and processes of secondary decomposition caused by drainage.

AB The competition between peat mosses (Sphagnum) and vascular plants as affected by raised CO2 and increased N deposition was studied in a glasshouse experiment by exposing peat monoliths with monocultures and mixtures of Sphagnum magellanicum and Eriophorum angustifolium to ambient (350 ppmv) or raised (560 ppmv) atmospheric CO2 concentrations, combined with low (no N addition) or high (5 g m(-2) yr(-1) added) N deposition. Growth of the two species was monitored for three growing seasons.
   The presence of Eriophorum did not affect Sphagnum biomass, because Eriophorum density did not become high enough to severely shade the moss surface. In contrast, Sphagnum had a negative effect on Eriophorum biomass, particularly on the number of flowering stems. Possibly, the presence of a living Sphagnum layer decreased nutrient availability to Eriophorum by immobilising nutrients mineralised from the peat.
   Raised CO2 and/or increased N deposition did not change these competitive relationships between Sphagnum and Eriophorum, but had independent effects. Raised CO2 had a positive effect both on Sphagnum and Eriophorum biomass, though on Eriophorum the effect was transient, probably because of P limitation. Nitrogen addition had a direct negative effect on Sphagnum height growth in the first growing season, but by the third year an increased shoot density had cancelled this out, so no N effect on Sphagnum biomass was present at the end of the experiment. The response of Eriophorum to N addition was small; N availability appeared not to limit its growth.

AB New data on the diurnal variability of methane emission in summer (2013-2014) from West Siberia peatland ecosystems are presented. It is demonstrated that diurnal variations in methane emission differ much depending on a peatland ecosystem under study. Diurnal variations in methane emission in the fens and hollows of the ridge-hollow complex (RHC) are revealed as well as their reproducibility in 2013-2014. The maximum emission is registered in the daytime, and the minimum is observed at night. There is no diurnal variation in methane emission in ryams (pine bogs) and ridges of RHC. It is revealed that in the upper layer of peat (at the depth up to 10 cm for hollows and at the depth of 2 and 5 cm for fens) the contribution of temperature variability to methane emission variations in fens and hollows is 15-20%. The multiple linear regression with peat temperature at several depths allows explaining 44-54% of the variability of methane flux from peatlands. No significant correlation between methane fluxes and the temperature of peat and air was identified in the diurnal cycle in ryams and ridges.

AB Vegetation and environmental patterns, and associated ecological processes, were quantified from 42 sites on several transects in each of two extensive (5 and 220 ha) low-alpine patterned mires in the same region of south-central New Zealand. Plant communities, as derived from multivariate analyses, were correlated with 15 physical and chemical environmental factors. Various measures of water availability and chemistry were consistently the most significant factors in relation to vegetation patterns in both mires. In the smaller mire, plant cover adjacent to pools, which were partly or completely drained through underground tunnels, dominated the overall correlations. The nutrient status of surface water had a consistent negative relationship with water availability. No consistent spatial or temporal patterns were found in the concentrations of Ca, Mg, K or Na, nor pH or conductivity in pool water. Evaporative enrichment of cations on the surface of both mires was noted, with levels consistently higher in surface than in adjacent pool water. The somewhat higher nutrient status in the smaller mire may be a result of the size and/or the amounts of run-off from the surrounding slopes onto the mire surface or through the underground pipe system. Hydrogen (D) and oxygen ((18) O) isotopic compositions in water from pools, the mire surface and below ground from the smaller mire, suggested that there was negligible mixing of evaporation-enriched surface water with groundwater. Differences in overall nutrient levels in the two mires were relatively small and indicative of mesotrophic or marginally ombrotrophic status for these mires. Although of international significance, the wetland complex currently has inadequate formal protection. Possible options are assessed.

AB Wetlands are important and restricted habitats for dependent biota and play vital roles in landscape function, hydrology and carbon sequestration. They are also likely to be one of the most sensitive components of the terrestrial biosphere to global climate change. An understanding of relationships between wetland persistence and climate is imperative for predicting, mitigating and adapting to the impacts of future climate change on wetland extent and function. We investigated whether mire wetlands had contracted, expanded or remained stable during 1960-2000. We chose a study area encompassing a regional climatic gradient in southeastern Australia, specifically to avoid confounding effects of water extraction on wetland hydrology and extent. We first characterized trends in climate by examining data from local weather stations, which showed a slight increase in precipitation and marked decline in pan evaporation over the relevant period. Remote sensing of vegetation boundaries showed a marked lateral expansion of mires during 1961-1998, and a corresponding contraction of woodland. The spatial patterns in vegetation change were consistent with the regional climatic gradient and showed a weaker co-relationship to fire history. Resource exploitation, wildland fires and autogenic mire development failed to explain the observed expansion of mire vegetation in the absence of climate change. We therefore conclude that the extent of mire wetlands is likely to be sensitive to variation in climatic moisture over decadal time scales. Late 20th-century trends in climatic moisture may be related primarily to reduced irradiance and/or reduced wind speeds. In the 21st century, however, net climatic moisture in this region is projected to decline. As mires are apparently sensitive to hydrological change, we anticipate lateral contraction of mire boundaries in coming decades as projected climatic drying eventuates. This raises concerns about the future hydrological functions, carbon storage capacity and unique biodiversity of these important ecosystems.

AB Peatlands and permafrost are important components of the carbon cycle in the northern high latitudes. The inclusion of these components into a dynamic global vegetation model required changes to physical land surface routines, the addition of two new peatland-specific plant functional types, incorporation of an inundation stress mechanism, and deceleration of decomposition under inundation. The new model, LPJ-WHy v1.2, was used to simulate net ecosystem production (NEP), net primary production (NPP), heterotrophic respiration (HR), and soil carbon content. Annual peatland NEP matches observations even though the seasonal amplitude is overestimated. This overestimation is caused by excessive NPP values, probably due to the lack of nitrogen or phosphorus limitation in LPJ-WHy. Introduction of permafrost reduces circumpolar (45-90 degrees N) NEP from 1.65 to 0.96 Pg C a(-1) and leads to an increase in soil carbon content of almost 40 Pg C; adding peatlands doubles this soil carbon increase. Peatland soil carbon content and hence HR depend on model spin-up duration and are crucial for simulating NEP. These results highlight the need for a regional peatland age map to help determine spin-up times. A sensitivity experiment revealed that under future climate conditions, NPP may rise more rapidly than HR resulting in increases in NEP.

AB We studied the effect of ditch blocking on vegetation composition and water-table depths in a blanket peatland. Measurements were made for a period of four years (water tables) and five years (vegetation) in the inter-ditch areas of three experimental treatments: (i) open ditches, (ii) ditches blocked with closely-spaced dams and (iii) ditches partially infilled with peat and blocked with dams. It is often assumed that ditch blocking will lead to an increase in the abundance of Sphagnum and, potentially, a reduction in the abundance of sedges, particularly the cotton grasses. However, our data show no treatment effects on the abundance of either group. We did find an effect of time, with the abundance of both sedges and Sphagnum spp. varying significantly between some years. For the sedges there was no systematic change over time, while for the Sphagnum spp. abundance tended to increase through the study period. This systematic change was not related to a measure of the vigour of the sedges, although vigour was lower towards the end of the study compared to the beginning. Our vegetation data are consistent with our water-table data. As with plant type abundance, we did not find any statistically significant differences in water-table depths between treatments, both for annual averages and summer averages. We comment on why ditch blocking does not seem to have affected water tables and vegetation composition at our study site.

AB Fine roots contribute to ecosystem carbon, water, and nutrient fluxes through resource acquisition, respiration, exudation, and turnover, but are understudied in peatlands. We aimed to determine how the amount and timing of fine-root growth in a forested, ombrotrophic bog varied across gradients of vegetation density, peat microtopography, and changes in environmental conditions across the growing season and throughout the peat profile.
   We quantified fine-root peak standing crop and growth using non-destructive minirhizotron technology over a two-year period, focusing on the dominant woody species in the bog: Picea mariana, Larix laricina, Rhododendron groenlandicum, and Chamaedaphne calyculata.
   The fine roots of trees and shrubs were concentrated in raised hummock microtopography, with more tree roots associated with greater tree densities and a unimodal peak in shrub roots at intermediate tree densities. Fine-root growth tended to be seasonally dynamic, but shallowly distributed, in a thin layer of nutrient-poor, aerobic peat above the growing season water table level.
   The dynamics and distribution of fine roots in this forested ombrotrophic bog varied across space and time in response to biological, edaphic, and climatic conditions, and we expect these relationships to be sensitive to projected environmental changes in northern peatlands.

AB Studying boreal-type peatlands near the edge of their southern limit can provide insight into responses of boreal and sub-arctic peatlands to warmer climates. In this study, we investigated peatland history using multi-proxy records of sediment composition, plant macrofossil, pollen, and diatom analysis from a C-14-dated sediment core at Tannersville Bog in northeastern Pennsylvania, USA. Our results indicate that peat accumulation began with lake infilling of a glacial lake at similar to 9 ka as a rich fen dominated by brown mosses. It changed to a poor fen dominated by Cyperaceae (sedges) and Sphagnum (peat mosses) at similar to 1.4 ka and to a Sphagnum-dominated poor fen at similar to 200 cal yr BP (similar to AD 1750). Apparent carbon accumulation rates increased from 13.4 to 101.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during the last 8000 yr, with a time-averaged mean of 27.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). This relatively high accumulation rate, compared to many northern peatlands, was likely caused by high primary production associated with a warmer and wetter temperate climate. This study implies that some northern peatlands can continue to serve as carbon sinks under a warmer and wetter climate, providing a negative feedback to climate warming.

AB The effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) and water table draw-down on soil carbon sequestration in an ombrotrophic bog ecosystem were examined. Peat monoliths (11 cm diameter, 25 cm deep) with intact bog vegetation were exposed to ambient or elevated (ambient + 200 mg l(-1)) atmospheric CO2, combined with a natural water table (level with the peat surface) or a water table draw-down (-5 cm). Eight observations per treatment were included in the study, which was conducted over a 12 week period. Concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), phenolic compounds and the fluxes of CO2 and CH4 were measured. The eCO(2) treatment caused an increase in the CH4 and CO2 fluxes and a small decrease in both the DOC and phenolic concentrations. The water table draw-down invoked decreases in phenolic and DOC concentrations, a decrease in CH4 flux and a small increase in CO2 flux. The combined (eCO(2) + water table draw-down) treatment caused a larger than expected CH4 flux decrease and CO2 flux increase and an increase in DOC concentration. Our results suggest very different effects on the system dependent on the treatment applied. The draw-down treatment principally increased oxidation of the rhizosphere resulting in increased decomposition and as such a removal of material from the dissolved carbon pool. The data also suggest labile carbon availability may be limiting the rate of decomposition and so slowing inorganic nutrient and carbon pool turn-over. The elevated CO2 addressed the labile-carbon limitation. Under the environment of the combined treatment, these limitations were effectively removed, culminating in a destabilisation of the carbon-sequestering environment to a weaker sink (or even a source) of atmospheric carbon.

AB Northern peatlands are sinks for atmospheric carbon (C), but peat extraction converts these ecosystems to C sources. Due to a dry regional climate, undisturbed bog peatlands in western Canada often have a tree cover of Picea mariana (Mill.) B. S. P. Thus, a coniferous forest plantation may be an appropriate land use for cutover peatlands. This study determined the effect of a 7-year-old P. mariana plantation on C balance of a cutover peatland. We measured C stored in P. mariana biomass and carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes from bare peat at each of four fertilizer doses. Carbon stored in biomass of Betula papyrifera (Marsh.) that had spontaneously colonized the postfertilized site was also determined. Given that the water table remained very deep and that the sphagnum moss-ericaceous shrub peat-accumulating vegetation was not present, the site remained a source of C when only the planted P. mariana trees were considered, primarily in the form of CO2 emissions by soil respiration. However, C accumulation in trees, including B. papyrifera biomass, resulted in a net C sink in fertilized plots. Results from this study indicate that tree plantations on cutover peatland may be a suitable land-management strategy on sites difficult to effectively rewet.

AB The Bell coal bed is one of the stratigraphically oldest coals (Atokan, Duckmantian) in the Illinois Basin that has been commercially mined and occurs near the Morrowan-Atokan boundary, which was a time of significant lithologic change in the basin. The Bell coal occurs as a series of discontinuous pods, in contrast to younger (Asturian) coals in the basin that are thicker and more extensive in occurrence. Thirty-two samples of coal and carbonaceous shale, collected from surface mine, outcrop, and drill core locations were analyzed geochemically, petrographically and palynologically to ascertain the origin of the Bell coal bed in western Kentucky.
   The Bell coal exhibits a great deal of variability in thickness and composition, both temporally and spatially. Based on ash yields, the Bell coal consists of intercalated layers of coal (<= 25% ash), impure coal ( > 25 to < 50% ash) and carbonaceous shale ( >= 50% ash). Sulfur contents vary significantly, from 0.2% to 10.0%. Petrographically, the Bell coal is mainly a high vitrinite coal ( > 80%, mmf), with telovitrinite occurring more frequently than detrovitrinite and gelovitrinite. Certain layers, however, contain elevated amounts of liptinite and inertinite. Among the inertinite macerals, examples of both fire (e.g., fusinite) and degradation (e.g., macrinite) origin are evident. Samples with elevated amounts of inertinite are commonly, though not exclusively, high in ash, indicating that some of the inertinite may be of allochthonous origin.
   Palynologically, the Bell coal is dominated by arborescent lycopod spores (avg. > 70%), occurring primarily as Lycospora, with some samples containing increased proportions of spores and pollen from other Pennsylvanian plant groups. Samples with more heterogenous palynofloras commonly have elevated ash yields, indicating that some portion of the assemblages may be also of allochthonous origin.
   Collectively, the Bell coal is interpreted to have formed from a series of small, disconnected paleomires that were planar and topogenous with paleotopography having an influence on peat development. A planar, topogenous origin helps to explain the highly variable ash yields and sulfur contents. Accumulating peat, principally from arborescent lycopod source material, was mainly well-preserved, but punctuated with intervals marked by sediment influx, the development of more heterogeneous palynofloras and degradation and oxidation of the surficial peat by both biologic (decay) and abiotic (fire) processes.

AB VEGETATION HISTORY OF ROMERSBERG FOREST (LORRAINE PLAIN, FRANCE) SINCE THE MIDDLE AGES
   Many wet closed depressions are located in low altitude "ancient" forests of the Lorrain plateau on the Keuper marl substratum. The origin of these depressions remains hypothetical. Some of these depressions are filled with peat and colonized by acid peat bog vegetation. A 440 cm deep peat core from the Romersberg forest was analysed for pollen and radiocarbon dated. Sediment and palynological records begin during the 8(th) century in forested context marked by a direct anthropogenic impact corresponding to Carolingian clearance. Aquatic taxa (Potamogeton, Nymphaea) colonized the structure which can be compared to a small pond bordered by Alnus and Salix. The main period of anthropogenic impact occurs during the 12(th) century linked with salt factory establishment in Dieuze town which used a part of the Romersberg forest for wood supply. Anthropogenic impact increases during the 14(th) century with salt industry development. Peat formation begins during this period along with acid vegetation development. In the 15(th) century, Romersberg forest becomes an exclusive forestry supply area for rock salt industry with short tree exploitation cycle. During the industrial revolution, salt industry substitute wood by coal as fuel and Romersberg forest exploitation switch from short exploitation cycle to actual forestry exploitation system.

AB We studied the natural regeneration of an ombrotrophic peatland (Cacouna bog) located in southern Quebec that was disturbed by peat mining and other anthropogenic activities over a 200-year period. Using an extensive collection of historical documents, as well as dendrochronological data, we reconstructed the history of the peatland. We also sampled vegetation and environmental variables, and integrated the data in a geographic information system. More than 60% of the total area of the bog was mined between 1942 and 1975, and 98 km of ditches were dug to drain the site. The peatland lost 34% of its initial peat volume between 1946 and 1998. Although the bog was severely disturbed, the spontaneous revegetation of the site by vascular plants was successful (90%-100% cover). However, only 10% of the total mined area has been recolonized by Sphagnum species, mainly because drainage ditches are still operational and contribute to drying out the bog. Water table level, peat deposit thickness, and pH are abiotic factors strongly influencing the vegetation composition in the bog. Spatial and historical factors are also important components in this study since they explain, either alone or in interaction with abiotic factors, 44% of the variation of the species data. The intensity of mining activities and the pattern of abandonment of mined sectors strongly influenced abiotic factors, which in turn affected the revegetation process. Even if the Sphagnum cover of the bog is low, the rapid "recovery" of the vegetation cover in the peatland indicates that after the reestablishment of an appropriate hydrological regime, a highly disturbed peatland has a considerable potential for regeneration.

AB Peat plateaus are widespread at high northern latitudes and are important soil organic carbon reservoirs. A warming climate can cause either increased ground subsidence (thermokarst) resulting in lake formation or increased drainage as the permafrost thaws. A better understanding of spatiotemporal variations in these landforms in relation to climate change is important for predicting the future thawing permafrost carbon feedback. In this study, dynamics in thermokarst lake extent during the last 35-50 years has been quantified through time series analysis of aerial photographs and high-resolution satellite images (IKONOS/QuickBird) in three peat plateau complexes, spread out across the northern circumpolar region along a climatic and permafrost gradient. From the mid-1970s until the mid-2000s there has been an increase in mean annual air temperature, winter precipitation, and ground temperature in all three study areas. The two peat plateaus located in the continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones, respectively, where mean annual air temperatures are below -5 degrees C and ground temperatures are -2 degrees C or colder, have experienced small changes in thermokarst lake extent. In the peat plateau located in the sporadic permafrost zone where the mean annual air temperature is around -3 degrees C, and the ground temperature is close to 0 degrees C, lake drainage and infilling with fen vegetation has been extensive and many new thermokarst lakes have formed. In a future progressively warmer and wetter climate permafrost degradation can cause significant impacts on landscape composition and greenhouse gas exchange also in areas with extensive peat plateaus, which presently still experience stable permafrost conditions.

AB Bog ecosystems are sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance, including drainage and air pollution. Carbon (C) balance measurements to determine the effect of disturbance on bog functioning are laborious; therefore reliable proxies for C fluxes that could facilitate upscaling from single studies to a larger scale would be valuable. We measured peat CO2 emissions (R (s)), CH4 efflux and vegetation characteristics in four bog areas that formed a gradient from pristine to severely disturbed peatlands, affected by drainage, peat mining, alkaline air pollution and underground oil-shale mining. We expected that sites experiencing higher human impact (i.e., the vegetation was more distinct from that of a natural bog) would have higher R (s) and lower CH4 emissions, but differences in peat C emissions between the most disturbed and pristine sites were not significant. Growing period median R (s) ranged from 0.5 to 2.2 g C m(-2) day(-1) for our plots; methane emissions, measured from July to December were an order of magnitude lower, ranging from -5.9 to 126.7 mg C m(-2) day(-1). R (s) and CH4 emissions were primarily determined by water table depth, as was tree stand productivity. Therefore, stand structural parameters could potentially be good indicators of soil C emissions from poorly drained forested bogs.

AB Paleoecological records from two Holocene peat bogs in northern Germany are linked by two microscopic volcanic ash layers, correlated by petrology and geochemistry to explosive volcanism on Iceland. The younger "Microlite tephra" cannot be correlated to any known eruption, while the older tephra layer is identified as a deposit of the Hekla 3 eruption. The tephra layers are dated by an age-depth regression of accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 ages that have been calibrated and combined in probability distributions. This procedure gives an age of 730-664 cal yr B.C. for the "Microlite tephra" event and 1087-1006 cal yr B.C. for the Hekla 3 event. Accordingly, the tephra layers were deposited during the late Bronze Age. At this time, human settlement slowly increased pressure on the environment, as indicated by changes in woodland pollen composition at the two bogs. The tephra-marker horizons further show that the palynologically defined transition from the Subboreal to the Subatlantic Period is synchronous in the investigated area. However, the macroscopic visible marker in peat, the change from fibrous to sapric peat, the "Schwarztorf-Weisstorf-Kontakt," is asynchronous. Bog vegetation did not immediately react in unison to a climatic change at this pollen zone boundary; instead, the timing of vegetation change depended on the location within the bog.

AB Production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from peatland soil is controlled by rates of organic matter decomposition; soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition is influenced by the quality of the SOM and the soil temperature. This study determined the effect of increasing temperature and SOM quality on rates of greenhouse-gas production in lab incubations from peat soils formed under different plant functional types found in temperate rich and poor fens of southern Ontario, Canada. Peat derived from different plant functional type (sedge, shrub, and non-vascular vegetation) between the fens was composed of different amounts of SOM, lignin, and cellulose. Rates of CO2 and CH4 production from the lab slurriesin creased with increasing temperature; however, the relative increases were specific to the vegetation type overlying the soils. Anaerobic to aerobic production ratios ranged from 7% (Chamaedaphne soils) to > 30% (Sphagnum soils). Ratios of potential anaerobic production (CO2 to CH4) generally decreasedwith increasing temperature. The interaction between temperature and SOM quality was demonstrated through the range of Q(10) values (1.09-2.38 for CO2; 2.98-21.40 for CH4). These measures were correlated to lignin and cellulose content and the lingo-cellulose index. Results of this study indicate the variability of greenhouse-gas fluxes from peatland soils is influenced by the SOM quality derived from the overlying vegetation. As the climate warms soil temperatures will increase rates of decomposition, and this study will improve models of temperate peatland carbon cycling and can inform land management planning by providing options for minimizing carbon loss.

AB Here we present the first high-resolution multi-proxy analysis of a rich fen in the central-eastern European lowlands. The fen is located in the young glacial landscape of the Sta(z) over dotki river valley. We investigated the fen's development pathways, asking three main questions: (i) what was the pattern and timing of the peatland's vegetation succession, (ii) how did land use and climate affect the succession in the fen ecosystem, and (iii) to what degree does the reconstructed hydrology for this site correlate with those of other sites in the region in terms of past climate change? Several stages of fen history were determined, beginning with the lake-to-fen transition ca. AD 700. Brown mosses dominated the sampling site from this period to the present. No human impact was found to have occurred until ca. AD 1700, when the first forest cutting began. Around AD 1890 a more significant disturbance took place - this date marks the clear cutting of forests and dramatic landscape openness. Deforestation changed the hydrology and chemistry of the mire, which was revealed by a shift in local plant and testate amoebae communities. We also compared a potential climatic signal recorded in the peat profile before AD 1700 with other sites from the region. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The restoration of ecosystem services, i.e., production, regulation, and information, is a global challenge, which the federal state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in NE Germany addressed in 2000 by rewetting over 20,000 ha of degraded peatlands within the Mire Restoration Program. We evaluated ecosystem services in 23 rewetted sites by assessing the following mire parameters within a ten year period: (a) dominant vegetation at the ecosystem level, (b) peat formation potential at the landscape level, and (c) aboveground biomass and nutrient levels. Seven to 10 years after rewetting, the wetlands formed a mosaic of vegetation types with the highest potential for peat formation and several dominant, peat-forming species accumulated high levels of aboveground biomass and nutrients (C, N, P). Common reed (Phragmites australis) accumulated the most biomass (up to 24 t dry matter/ha), and N+P during the growing season. A future management option is to annually harvest aquatic and wetland plants to reduce nutrient levels in restored mire ecosystems.

AB Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are designed for the study of past, present and future vegetation patterns together with associated biogeochemical cycles and climate feedbacks. However, most DGVMs do not yet have detailed representations of permafrost and non-permafrost peatlands, which are an important store of carbon, particularly at high latitudes. We demonstrate a new implementation of peatland dynamics in a customized "Arctic" version of the LPJ-GUESS DGVM, simulating the long-term evolution of selected northern peatland ecosystems and assessing the effect of changing climate on peatland carbon balance. Our approach employs a dynamic multi-layer soil with representation of freeze-thaw processes and litter inputs from a dynamically varying mixture of the main peatland plant functional types: mosses, shrubs and graminoids. The model was calibrated and tested for a sub-Arctic mire in Stordalen, Sweden, and validated at a temperate bog site in Mer Bleue, Canada. A regional evaluation of simulated carbon fluxes, hydrology and vegetation dynamics encompassed additional locations spread across Scandinavia. Simulated peat accumulation was found to be generally consistent with published data and the model was able to capture reported long-term vegetation dynamics, water table position and carbon fluxes. A series of sensitivity experiments were carried out to investigate the vulnerability of high-latitude peatlands to climate change. We found that the Stordalen mire may be expected to sequester more carbon in the first half of the 21st century due to milder and wetter climate conditions, a longer growing season, and the CO2 fertilization effect, turning into a carbon source after mid-century because of higher decomposition rates in response to warming soils.

AB Globally, peatlands have been affected by drainage and peat extraction, with adverse effects on their functioning and services. To restore peat-forming vegetation, drained bogs are being rewetted on a large scale. Although this practice results in higher groundwater levels, unfortunately it often creates deep lakes in parts where peat was extracted to greater depths than the surroundings. Revegetation of these deeper waters by peat mosses appears to be challenging due to strong abiotic feedbacks that keep these systems in an undesired bare state. In this study, we theoretically explore if a floating peat mat and an open human-made bog lake can be considered two alternative stable states using a simple model, and experimentally test in the field whether stable states are present, and whether a state shift can be accomplished using floating biodegradable structures that mimic buoyant peat. We transplanted two peat moss species into these structures (pioneer sp. Sphagnum cuspidatum and later-successional sp. S. palustre) with and without additional organic substrate. Our model suggests that these open human-made bog lakes and floating peat mats can indeed be regarded as alternative stable states. Natural recovery by spontaneous peat moss growth, i.e., a state shift from open water to floating mats, is only possible when the water table is sufficiently shallow to avoid light limitation (<0.29 m at our site). Our experiment revealed that alternative stable states are present and that the floating structures facilitated the growth of pioneer S. cuspidatum and vascular plants. Organic substrate addition particularly facilitated vascular plant growth, which correlated to higher moss height. The structures remained too wet for the late-successional species S. palustre. We conclude that open water and floating peat mats in human-made bog lakes can be considered two alternative stable states, and that temporary floating establishment structures can induce a state shift from the open water state to peat-forming vegetation state. These findings imply that for successful restoration, there is a clear water depth threshold to enable peat moss growth and there is no need for addition of large amounts of donor-peat substrate. Correct species selection for restoration is crucial for success.

AB The results of studying the carbon dioxide fluxes from the soil's surface during three years taking into account the microrelief are summarized. More precise estimates were obtained for the annual CO2 emission from the oligotrophic peat bogs differing in vegetation and waterlogging in the southern taiga of European Russia. The maximum differences in the rates of the CO2 emission related to the microrelief elements are characteristic of the treeless ridge-pool complex, where the hollows (without vegetation) emitted CO2 twice less than the flat areas and thrice less than the hummocks. In the forest bogs, the differences related to the microrelief were significantly lower. In the areas with the ridge-pool microrelief, the weighted average (for 3 years) CO2 emission was 436 g C/m(2) per year; in the better drained natural dwarf shrub-cotton grass-sphagnum pine forest, 930; and in the drained pine forest, 1292 g C/m(2) per year. The share of the CO2 amount emitted in the cold period (November-April) amounted to 10% of its annual flux from the peat soils of the ridge-pool complex and 17 and 24%, respectively, in the natural and drained pine forests.

AB In November 2005, Tierra del Fuego (Argentina) hosted the biennial conference and field excursion of the International Mire Conservation Group (IMCG). The group considered the vegetation, hydrology, peat stratigraphy and possible management options for about 20 mires which were visited during a seven-day excursion. We report here some field observations and measurements of electrical conductivity (EC25) in five mires which have been selected to encompass the most important ecohydrological features of the mires of Tierra del Fuego. Existing and new data on landscape topography and vegetation were combined in three-dimensional drawings. These drawings are actually conceptual models which could underpin further ecohydrological research, and proved to be very useful as a basis for discussions amongst conference participants about possible ecohydrological relationships. The mires that were studied developed under a wide range of climatic conditions and included fens and bogs. The bogs typically developed from lakes or fens and most are now dominated by Sphagnum magellanicum. This species forms large hummocks, and can invade weakly-buffered fens. Most of the mires were well preserved, but effects of human impact - such as road building and peat extraction - were also noticeable.

AB The West Siberian Lowland (WSL) contains the world's most extensive peatlands and a substantial fraction of the global terrestrial carbon pool. Despite its recognition as a carbon reservoir of great significance, the extent, thickness, and carbon content of WSL peatlands have not been analyzed in detail. This paper compiles a wide array of data into a geographic information system (GIS) to create a high-resolution, spatially explicit digital inventory of all WSL peatlands and their associated physical properties. Detailed measurements for nearly 10,000 individual peatlands (patches) are based on compilation of previously unpublished Russian field and ancillary map data, satellite imagery, previously published depth measurements, and our own field depth and core measurements taken throughout the region during field campaigns in 1999, 2000, and 2001. At the patch level, carbon storage is estimated as the product of peatland area, depth, and carbon content. Estimates of peatland area are validated from RESURS-01 satellite images, and the quality of the Russian peatland depth and carbon content data is independently confirmed by laboratory analysis of core samples. Through GIS-based spatial analysis of the peat areal extent, depth, and carbon content data, we conservatively estimate the total area of WSL peatlands at 592,440 km(2), the total peat mass at 147.82 Pg, and the total carbon pool at 70.21 Pg C. Our analysis concludes that WSL peatlands are more extensive and represent a substantially larger carbon pool than previously thought: Previous studies report 9,440-273,440 km(2) less peatland area and 15.11-30.19 Pg less carbon than found in this analysis.

AB Peatlands cover a small portion of the Earth's land surface but hold similar to 30% of soil carbon (C) globally. However, few studies have focused on the early stage of peatland development, which is a key stage in the initial C sink function of peatlands. An immature peatland is vulnerable to changes in environmental conditions, e.g., temperature and water conditions, as the peat accumulation process can be easily interrupted by such changes. It is important to understand how immature peatlands develop, what conditions are beneficial to this process, and the present status of these important peatlands. Plant macrofossil analysis and geochemical characteristics of peat were used to determine the plant succession and the degree of decomposition at two peatlands developing in the Changbai Mountain region of northeastern China. The results show that during the entire plant community succession, plants in the two studied peatlands are mainly characterized by sedges (Cyperaceae) and mosses (mainly Sphagnum). Plans macrofossil analysis reveals a wetter trend in the Yuan Lake (YL) peatland in the most upper parr of peat layer, which provides favorable conditions for peal accumulation and peatland development. The C/N ratios of core Chi Lake (CL) show a steady peal decomposition and accumulation process in the CL peatland. Additionally, there was a clear impact of presence of Sphagnum on the variations in the C. ratio. In the YL peatland, macro-charcoal pieces indicated that fire events during dry hydrological conditions had great effects on biogeochemical processes within the peatland, affecting peat decomposition and the succession of the local plant community. An increase in major and trace elements suggests only weak disturbance due to the considerable distance to human settlements. This study determines the characteristics of pristine mountainous peatlands and highlights the importance of understanding the regular plant community in the early stage of peatland formation, as well as its potential effects on C sinks.

AB We have compared microbial biomass and respiration rates in soils and decomposition of peat materials from the different components of a raised mire system. The microbial biomass in the lagg fen was not greater than that of the mineral soil or the mire expanse, but the respiration rate of the decomposer organisms in the lagg fen exceeded that of either the mire expanse or surrounding mineral soils. The respiration rate of microorganisms in litter recovered from litter bags in the lagg fen was greater than that in the mire expanse, and the microbial biomass of the litter was greater for the lagg fen than for either the mineral soil or the mire expanse. Further, the litter from minerotrophic plants decomposed faster than the ombrotrophic species.

AB Pattern and zonation of peatland vegetation are regulated by environmental gradients, as well as by effects of biomass and competitive exclusion on distribution of species richness. The interplay of these factors has not been closely examined in calcareous prairie fens, which are isolated, species rich, calcareous peatlands in the Prairie Peninsula region of North America. We used multivariate analyses to classify vegetation and to quantify species richness in relation to substrate conditions and vegetation structure in a 23 ha calcareous prairie fen in northeast Illinois, USA. Plant assemblages formed a floristic continuum across sedge meadow, graminoid fen, calcareous seep, marl flat, and spring run vegetation, with complete dissimilarity between spring run and sedge meadow. These vegetation zones corresponded to gradients of decreasing organic content and cation exchange capacity, and increasing pH, Na, Mg, and total Ca concentrations, which reach extremes in spring run and marl flats. Species richness was unimodal across the fen gradient, fitting an expected model of low richness in vegetation either with large biomass (as shown by low light penetration in tall sedge meadow) or with environmentally harsh conditions and low biomass (shown by high light penetration in short marl flat and spring run vegetation). These biotic and abiotic factors, as well as hydrology, mediate vegetation pattern across the fen.

AB Peatland ground layer species composition is intricately tied to ecosystem function (for example, carbon storage). As the primary disturbance in boreal bogs, wildfire selectively removes the ground layer vegetation, creating heterogeneous habitat conditions and initiating succession. However, the successional trajectory of the ground layer community following fire is poorly understood. Here we assess spatial and temporal changes in community composition along a chronosequence of post-fire bogs (1-105 years since fire) in north central Alberta, Canada. We established vegetation plots in 13 bogs and repeatedly monitored them from 2003-2006. We found three phases of the post-fire bog community, grading from pioneer true moss (for example, Polytrichum strictum) dominance soon post-fire (< 10 ysf) to persistent Sphagnum dominance in mature sites (20-80 ysf) with partial replacement by feathermosses (for example, Pleurozium schreberi) in older bogs (> 80 ysf). Mature bogs dominated by Sphagnum fuscum had the greatest species richness, although species evenness was low. Spatial heterogeneity of ground layer community composition was bimodal, peaking approximately 10 ysf (co-occurrence of true mosses and Sphagnum) and more than 80 ysf when feathermosses encroach and break-up Sphagnum dominance, resulting in inverse relationships of community species richness and diversity along the post-fire recovery gradient. Based on these results, we develop a conceptual model of post-fire bog recolonization and succession, in which microtopography, soil moisture, and combustion severity interact, thereby presenting the first comprehensive description of the spatio-temporal post-fire successional trajectory of the bog ground layer.

AB Rates of methanogenesis vary widely in peat soils, yet the reasons are poorly known. We examined rates of methanogenesis and methanogen diversity in relation to soil chemical and biological characteristics in 2 peatlands in New York State. One was an acidic (pH < 4.5) bog dominated by Sphagnum mosses and ericaceous shrubs, although deeper peat was derived from sedges. The other was a fen dominated by Carex lacustris sedges with near-neutral pH soil. At both sites, the most active rates of methanogenesis occurred in the top 20 cm of the peat profile, even when using a substrate-induced methanogenesis technique with added glucose that stimulated rates up to 2 mu mol g(-1) day(-1) in the bog and 6 mu mol g(-1) day(-1) in the fen. Rates of anaerobic CO(2)production were greater in the bog (0-36 mu mol g(-1) day(-1)) than in the fen (0-5 mu mol g(-1) day(-1)), and added glucose induced greater rates in the sedge-derived peat from the bog than the fen. The peat soil was much more decomposed throughout the profile in the fen. Analysis of chemical elements in the peat profile revealed a striking anomaly: a very high concentration of Pb in surface peat of the bog, which might have constrained methanogenesis. Application of T-RFLP analysis to methanogens revealed dominance by a Methanomicrobiales E2 clade of H-2/CO2 users in the acidic peat soil of the bog, whereas deeper peat had a different Methanomicrobiales E1 clade, uncultured euryarchaeal rice cluster (RC)-I and RC-II groups, marine benthic group D (MBD) and a new cluster called subaqueous cluster (SC). In contrast, T-RFLP analysis of peat from the fen revealed codominance by Methanosaetaceae and Methanomicrobiales E1. The results showed complex relationships between rates of methanogenesis, methanogen populations and metabolic substrate availability with idiosyncratic interactions of trace chemical elements.

Basal ages from LG3 and LG2 indicate up to an 1100 years later and possibly more abrupt Tyrrell Sea retreat in the LG3 area compared with the timeline for the region. Both autogenic and allogenic factors were found to have influenced local vegetation succession and rates of peat accumulation. Internal autogenic factors such as peat accumulation were key elements for the general peatland developmental pathway that followed the classic hydrosere sequence (pond-fen-bog). Regional climate and hydrography are the main external factors associated with changes in vegetation assemblages, surface wetness and consequently rates of peat accumulation. The LG2 and LG3 peatlands began developing shortly after 7000 cal. BP as shallow ponds with herbaceous fresh water aquatic and emergent taxa. Both sites rapidly evolved into fens with brown mosses. The autogenic transition from fen to bog occurred at both sites between 6000 and 5500 cal. BP. A long-term decrease in peat accumulation rates corresponding to a gradual densification of the local tree and shrub cover occurred at the LG2 and LG3 sites between 5000 and 1500 cal. BP. These changes were simultaneous at the two sites and therefore suggest the influence of external factors such as a shift to cooler and drier climatic conditions from the middle to late Holocene (Neoglacial period). Development of the LG1 site was delayed by a much later Tyrrell Sea retreat and started with a relatively long eutrophic aquatic phase. Both internal factors (minerotrophic conditions) and external factors (local topography and climate) contribute to the somewhat slower pace of vegetation succession. Synchronous increased peat accumulation rates in the last 1500 years at the three sites are attributable to regional vegetational shifts possibly due to the influence of recent climatic conditions and lower peat compaction of the acrotelm.

AB Floating fens are species-rich succession stages in fen areas in the Netherlands. Many of these fens are deteriorating due to acidification; Sphagnum species and Polytrichum commune build 10-25 cm thick moss carpets, and the species diversity decreases. Earlier experiments in wet ecosystems indicate that successful restoration of circum-neutral and mesotrophic conditions requires a combination of hydrological measures and sod removal. In an acidified fen recharged by rainwater in the nature reserve Ilperveld (The Netherlands), a ditch/trench system was dug for the purpose of creating a run-off channel for acid rainwater in wet periods and to enable circum-neutral surface water to enter the fen in dry periods. Moreover, the sod was removed in part of the fen. Ditch/trench creation or sod cutting had no effect individually, but a combination of the two measures led to a change in the abiotic conditions (higher pH and Ca), and in turn to an increase of species-richness and the reestablishment of a number of characteristic species. Reestablishment of rare vascular plant species and characteristic bryophytes might be a long-term process because of incomplete recovery of site conditions and constraints in seed dispersal.

AB The reconstruction of past environments by means of macrofossil and pollen analysis is commonly based on the modem ecological preferences of the taxa that may have produced these fossils. Here we present a modelling approach, in which we use modem vegetation surface height relationships to quantify past surface heights in an Arctic ice-wedge polygon mire. Vegetation composition and ground surface height (GSH) were assessed in a polygon mire near Kytalyk (Northeastern Siberia). Cluster analysis revealed five plant communities, which are clearly separated with respect to ground surface height, frost surface height and coverages of open water and vegetation. Based on the composition of modem vegetation we constructed two sets of potential fossil types (plant macrofossils and pollen), an extensive one and a more restricted one to reflect different conditions of preservation and recognisability. We applied Canonical Correspondence Analysis to model the relationships between potential fossil types and measured GSH. Both models show a strong relationship between modelled and measured GSH values and a high accuracy in prediction. Finally, we used the models to predict GSH values for Holocene peat samples and found a fair correspondence with expert-based multi-proxy reconstruction of wetness conditions, even though only a minor part of the encountered fossils were represented in the GSH models, illustrating the robustness of the approach. Our approach can be used to reconstruct palaeoenvironmental conditions in a more objective way and can serve as a template for further palaeoecological studies.

AB Peatlands store globally significant quantities of soil carbon, and Sphagnum moss is the main peat forming vegetation type in bogs. Sphagnum moss productivity is driven by the moisture content of its apical cluster of branches, the capitulum. Capitulum moisture content is dependent on the arrangement of leaves, branches and stems for a given species and also on hydrological conditions of the underlying peat. Despite this link, the response of CO2 exchange in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands to extreme drought is still unclear, particularly under field conditions.
   We used drainage to expose Sphagnum rubellum to extreme drought and monitored water table, volumetric water content (VWC), gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) at plots in a 25 m transect perpendicular to a deep drainage ditch and compared results to an undrained site. VWC in the upper 10 cm of peat was strongly related to water table at depths shallower than 55 cm. Below this depth, near surface VWC remained relatively constant between 25 and 28% and Sphagnum GEP was effectively shut down. This also resulted in decreased ER at these locations. The combined effect was a linear relationship between VWC and NEE with moist sites acting as net CO2 sinks (up to -5 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)) whereas sites closest to the ditch were consistently small carbon sources. We suggest that understanding how climate change will alter peatland hydrology relative to the moisture thresholds of Sphagnum mosses is critical to determining the fate of their carbon sink function.

AB This study used a two-dimensional steady-state finite-element groundwater flow model to simulate groundwater flow in two Newfoundland blanket peat complexes and to examine flow system sensitivity to changes in water table recharge and aquifer properties. The modelling results were examined within the context of peat-forming processes in the two complexes. Modelled flow compared favourably with observed flow. The sensitivity analyses suggested that more highly decomposed bog peat along bog margins probably has/had a positive impact on net peat accumulation within bog interiors. Peat with lower hydraulic conductivity along bog margins effectively impedes lateral drainage, localizes water table drawdown to extreme bog margins, and elevates water tables along bog interiors. Peat formation and elevated water tables in adjacent poor fens/laggs currently rely on placic and ortstein horizons impeding vertical drainage and water flow inputs from adjacent bogs. Modest reductions in atmospheric recharge were found to govern bog-flow-system geometries in a way that would adversely affect paludification processes in adjacent fens/laggs.

AB Overabundance of wild ungulates, especially exotic species, is a major threat to several ecosystems worldwide. While the response of forest vegetation to high density of herbivores has been well studied, far less is known about peatland vegetation. In this paper, we assessed the long term impact of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on plant communities of ombrotrophic (bog) and minerotrophic (fen) peatlands in eastern North America. Vegetation of five peatlands that have experienced high deer densities for at least 75 years was compared with that of five peatlands situated at proximity but on deer-free islands. We investigated deer impacts on plant species composition and cover, shrub height and cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus) fruit/flower production and morphology. In bogs, white-tailed deer had no long term impact on plant species assemblages, but reduced lichen cover and increased sedges and grasses cover as well as the surface area of bare peat. On the other hand, the floristic composition of fens differed significantly between sites where deer were present or absent. Plant diversity was greater in undisturbed fens than in disturbed fens, especially for shrubs, sedges and liverworts. No detrimental effects of browsing on shrub height were observed. Conversely, deer browsing seemed to have deleterious impacts on cloudberry fruit/flower production as well as on the number of leaves per individual. overall, our results suggest that white-tailed deer had some important impacts on the vegetation of peatlands that could be harmful for the long term conservation of peatland plant diversity.

AB Nitrogen (N) nutrition in pristine peatlands relies on the natural input of inorganic N through atmospheric deposition or biological dinitrogen (N-2) fixation. However, N-2 fixation and its significance for N cycling, plant productivity, and peat buildup are mostly associated with the presence of Sphagnum mosses. Here, we report high nonsymbiotic N-2-fixation rates in two pristine Patagonian bogs with diversified vegetation and natural N deposition. Nonsymbiotic N-2 fixation was measured in samples from 0 to 10, 10 to 20, and 40 to 50cm depth using the N-15(2) assay as well as theacetylene reduction assay (ARA). The ARA considerably underestimated N-2 fixation and can thus not be recommended for peatland studies. Based on the N-15(2) assay, high nonsymbiotic N-2-fixation rates of 0.3-1.4 molN(2)g(-1)day(-1) were found down to 50cm under micro-oxic conditions (2 vol.%) in samples from plots covered by Sphagnum magellanicum or by vascular cushion plants, latter characterized by dense and deep aerenchyma roots. Peat N concentrations point to greater potential of nonsymbiotic N-2 fixation under cushion plants, likely because of the availability of easily decomposable organic compounds and oxic conditions in the rhizosphere. In the Sphagnum plots, high N-2 fixation below 10cm depth rather reflects the potential during dry periods or low water level when oxygen penetrates the top peat layer and triggers peat mineralization. Natural abundance of the N-15 isotope of live Sphagnum (5.6 parts per thousand) from 0 to 10cm points to solely N uptake from atmospheric deposition and nonsymbiotic N-2 fixation. A mean N-15 signature of -0.7 parts per thousand of peat from the cushion plant plots indicates additional N supply from N mineralization. Our findings suggest that nonsymbiotic N-2 fixation overcomes N deficiency in different vegetation communities and has great significance for N cycling and peat accumulation in pristine peatlands.

AB Over the past century an ongoing establishment of Scots pine (Pinta sylvestris I.), sometimes at accelerating rates, is noted at three studied Lithuanian peat bogs, namely Kereplis, Rekyva and Aukstumala, all representing different degrees of tree coverage and geographic settings. Present establishment rates seem to depend on tree density on the bog surface and are most significant at sparsely covered sites where about three-fourth of the trees have established since the mid-1990s, whereas the initial establishment in general was during the early to mid-19th century. Three methods were used to detect, compare and describe tree establishment: (1) tree counts in small plots, (2) dendrochronological dating of bog pine trees, and (3) interpretation of aerial photographs and historical maps of the study areas. In combination, the different approaches provide complimentary information but also weigh up each other's drawbacks. Tree counts in plots provided a reasonable overview of age class distributions and enabled capturing of the most recently established trees with ages less than 50 years. The dendrochronological analysis yielded accurate tree ages and a good temporal resolution of long-term changes. Tree establishment and spread interpreted from aerial photographs and historical maps provided a good overview of tree spread and total affected area. It also helped to verify the results obtained with the other methods and an upscaling of findings to the entire peat bogs. The ongoing spread of trees in predominantly undisturbed peat bogs is related to warmer and/or drier climatic conditions, and to a minor degree to land-use changes. Our results therefore provide valuable insights into vegetation changes in peat bogs, also with respect to bog response to ongoing and future climatic changes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB 1. Soil samples were collected from 86 undrained, rich-fen sites chosen as representing similar numbers of the main types of rich-fen vegetation in lowland England and Wales.
   2. Concentration of major cations, nitrogen and phosphorus in soil extracts and digests were measured, together with the growth of seedlings of Epilobium hirsutum L. and, in some cases, of Phalaris arundinacea L. on the soils (phytometric assays). April-September increment of above-ground vegetation standing crop ('productivity') was also determined at each sampling site.
   3. Correlation and regression analyses showed that only a few chemical variables were significantly (and usually weakly) related to variation in either in situ above-ground 'production' or to phytometric response. Extracted and total concentrations of K and P showed a similar, weak, but significant relationship whilst N concentrations had no relationship.
   4. Standard measurements of N, P and K concentrations in fen soils do not provide a very reliable guide to their fertility. Results expressed in terms of volume of fresh soil were more satisfactory than those expressed per unit dry weight.
   5. The phytometric response of Epilobium hirsutum seedlings was strongly related to in situ 'production' and may provide a better estimate of soil fertility. The response of E. hirsutum was very strongly correlated with that of P. arundinacea.
   6. Seedlings of both phytometer species responded positively to experimental nutrient enrichment of a low fertility peat, but E. hirsutum responded more than did P. arundinacea and provides a more sensitive phytometer, especially in low fertility conditions. However, because E. hirsutum is sensitive to very high concentrations of available Fe and Mn, P. arundinacea may be a better phytometer for soils rich in reduced toxins.

AB 1 The bryophyte and vascular flora were described for a range of forested and open peatlands in the mid-boreal Clay Belt region of Canada, and in the subarctic region of the Labrador Trough, Quebec. The floristic patterns and their relationships to methane (CH4) emission, hydrology and water chemistry were analysed with classification (TWINSPAN), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA).
   2 Despite differences in vegetation physiognomy, chemistry, and geology, water chemistry (pH, Ca, Mg, K-corr) and hydrology explain most of the species distribution in both peatland regions. In the Clay Belt, bryophytes respond primarily to water table position, and secondarily to water chemistry; the reverse is true for the vascular flora. The bryophyte and vascular ordinations are more similar to each other in the Labrador Trough than in boreal sites.
   3 Although CH4 emissions are lower in subarctic than in boreal sites, mean CH4 flux is strongly correlated with mean water table position (r(2) = 0.73) in both regions, but is not correlated with water chemistry. The highest CH4 emissions (seasonal mean greater than or equal to 100 mg m(-2) day(-1)) occur in raised bog and patterned poor fen pools where the peat mat is degrading.
   4 The relationships among CH4 flux, mean water table position, and species distribution are similar in both boreal and subarctic regions. Bryophytes are generally better predictors of CH4 flux than vascular plants, except for certain species in flooded sites (e.g. Carer spp.). Bryophytes are also better indicators of the long-term average position of the water table, reflecting relative zones of methane production and oxidation over the season. In the vascular plant analyses, shrub cover indicates dry conditions and low CH4 flux in the sharply differentiated string-flark-pool topography of the subarctic fens, but is less predictive of CH4 emission in the drier hummock-hollow microtopography at boreal sites where shrubs and trees are more pervasive. Overall herbaceous or sedge cover is not indicative of CH4 flux in either region.

AB The importance of vegetation for nutrient retention was estimated in an overland flow area (OFA) in northern Finland, where peat mining water is purified by conducting it across a virgin mire. In the OFA the phytomass of herbs, sedges, graminoids and below-ground parts of plants was greater, and that of shrubs and bryophytes smaller, than in a reference area (RA). Overland flow treatment favoured plant species, such as Menyanthes trifoliata and Carer lasiocarpa, and discriminated against Sphagnum spp. in particular. The differences in the nutrient contents of plants in the OFA resulting from nutrient enrichment by peat mining water were compared with the actual decrease in amounts of nutrients in the area. Total phytomass in the OFA increased by 20%, and its N concentration increased from 1.00 to 1.24% of dry weight, but the P concentration decreased from 0.26 to 0.22% of dry weight. These changes in total phytomass and nutrient concentrations resulted in a 40% increase in the N bound by plants in the area, but a 5% decrease in P. The increase in N bound by the total phytomass in the OFA during the 6 years of usage accounted for only about 4% of the observed total retention of inorganic N. In contrast, the vegetation in the area served as a source of P rather than a sink with the decrease in P accounting for nearly 20% of the measured PO4-P retention. The average total decreases in both P and N in the OFA in 1987-91 were 55%. Thus, the net retention of N and P from the peat mining water was mainly the result of other processes rather than retention in the plant cover.

AB Wooded rich fens (WRF), characterized by high variation in surface topography and numerous plant species organized along microtopographic gradients, are abundant in continental western Canada. In regions where in situ oil sands exploration (OSE) prevails, however, winter operations eliminate the surface vegetation and mechanically flatten the exposed peat. This results in saturated or flooded soils during the growing season and eliminates plant species dependent on naturally elevated microhabitats, with implications for peatland recovery. In northeastern Alberta, we redeveloped hummock topography on replicate WRF after OSE by extracting blocks of frozen peat from peatland surfaces in the winter. Peat mounds and adjacent unmounded flattened areas were left to regenerate naturally and were sampled four to five summers later. Mounds facilitated the colonization of many peatland plants not adapted to waterlogged soils. For bryophytes, mean richness and diversity of liverworts, Sphagnum, and true mosses were higher in mounded plots than in unmounded plots. For vascular plants, woody plants (trees and shrubs) had higher richness, cover, and diversity (trees only) in mounded plots. Peat mounding may be effective for stimulating vegetation development on OSE-degraded WRF. All mounds, however, will require lateral expansion by hummock-forming mosses to provide the habitat volume required for development of large woody plants.

TI PLOT SIZE AND ESTIMATION EFFICIENCY IN PLANT COMMUNITY STUDIES

DE COVARIANCE; EIGENANALYSIS; PATTERN; SAMPLING; SPATIAL PROCESS;
   UNDERSTORY; VARIANCE
AB We examine the effects of changing plot size on parameter estimation efficiency in multivariate (community-level) ecological studies, where estimation efficiency is defined in terms relating to the statistical precision of estimates of all variables (e.g. species) in a data set.  Three 'efficiency criteria' for multivariate estimation are developed, and the relationship between estimation efficiency and plot size examined using three field data sets (deciduous understory, coniferous understory, and mire vegetation) from central Canada.
   For all three communities, estimation efficiency was found to increase monotonically with increasing plot size.  However, relative gains in efficiency at larger plot sizes were offset by substantial increases in sampling effort (enumeration time per plot).  Our results indicate that the largest plot size possible, given the constraints of time, should be used for parameter estimation in plant communities.  Also, plots that are larger than the mean patch size should be utilized when sampling heterogeneous vegetation.

AB We explore the environmental effects on variation in floristic compositional among montane shrub-dominated wetlands at the edge of their geographic distribution within the New England Batholith of eastern Australia. Canonical Correspondence and Redundancy Analyses revealed patterns and gradients in vascular plant species and families of bog communities. Variance partitioning quantified the relative contributions to variation in: (1) species composition; and (2) family composition due to climate, space, and landscape variables. Eleven of the 55 explanatory variables explained 29.2% of the total variance in the species dataset. Climatic factors were overall the best explanatory variables followed by spatial and then landscape characteristics. We found that climate variables were of most importance in determining whether shrub-dominated wetlands will occur at all and also their composition, which is in contrast to results from other studies not conducted at the edge of community distribution. Climate variables associated with seasonality were found to be highly significant correlates of composition as has been found for montane shrub-dominated wetlands in other parts of Australia. The season in which moisture availability becomes critical varies across different rainfall climatic zones. Under current predicated changes in regional climate, it is likely that an increase in variability and seasonality of climate will cause a retraction in the distribution of Australian montane bogs.

AB Climate change in the subarctic region has increased the rate of inundation of peatlands due to increased temperatures, precipitation, and permafrost thaw. Increased inundation may result in vegetation community shifts, as documented in a subarctic mire near Abisko, Sweden. The wet fen communities have established in former sphagnum areas, and sphagnum colonized in degraded palsa hummocks. At Stordalen mire, we studied the influence of vegetation community on chemical composition of peat soil organic matter (SOM). Vegetation and soil samples were obtained along a hydrologic gradient with representative communities: palsa, sphagnum, and fen. Soil organic matter chemical composition indicated shifts in vegetative communities. Total N and N isotope signatures in fen soils showed characteristics of sphagnum and palsa communities at >6-cm depth, and sphagnum soil profile signatures shifted from sphagnum to palsa properties at a 20-cm depth. Soil chemical composition measured by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and C-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy showed increasing recalcitrant C (alkyl and aromatic) in palsa soil. Sphagnum soil profiles sustained labile organic C (O-alkyl) until 15 cm then shifted to humified soil, and fen soil profiles showed areas of sphagnum and palsa signatures. Furthermore, the strong relationship between functional group C (O-alkyl and alkyl) and total N demonstrated that soil N is an effective indicator of peat decomposition. Our results identified change points in soil chemical composition in regards to N content and C functional group which highlights the importance of historic vegetation community on chemical composition of peat soils.

AB The Mer Bleue peatland is a large ombrotrophic bog with hummock-lawn microtopography, poor fen sections and beaver ponds at the margin. Average growing-season (May-October) fluxes of methane (CH(4)) measured in 2002-2003 across the bog ranged from less than 5 mg m(-2) d(-1) in hummocks, to greater than 100 mg m(-2) d(-1) in lawns and ponds. The average position of the water table explained about half of the variation in the season average CH(4) fluxes, similar to that observed in many other peatlands in Canada and elsewhere. The flux varied most when the water table position ranged between -15 and -40 cm. To better establish the factors that influence this variability, we measured CH(4) flux at approximately weekly intervals from May to November for 5 years (2004-2008) at 12 collars representing the water table and vegetation variations typical of the peatland. Over the snow-free season, peat temperature is the dominant correlate and the difference among the collars' seasonal average CH(4) flux is partially dependent on water table position. A third important correlate on CH(4) flux is vegetation, particularly the presence of Eriophorum vaginatum, which increases CH(4) flux, as well as differences in the potential of the peat profile to produce and consume CH(4) under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The combination of peat temperature and water table position with vegetation cover was able to explain approximately 44% of the variation in daily CH(4) flux, based on 1097 individual measurements. There was considerable inter-annual variation in fluxes, associated with varying peat thermal and water table regimes in response to variations in weather, but also by variations in the water level in peripheral ponds, associated with beaver dam activity. Raised water level in the beaver ponds led to higher water tables and increased CH(4) emission in the peatland.

AB Rewetting can effectively reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from drained peatlands. Reliable emissions estimation approaches are needed for accounting of such reductions and for evaluating the potential in terms of carbon credits. Annual mean water level and vegetation are reliable and widely used proxies for emissions estimation. However, indications of water level based on plant species (e.g. Ellenberg Indicator Values) are qualitative with large variances, and there are insufficient high-quality flux measurement data to support the direct use of vegetation as a proxy for GHG fluxes. Here we combine vegetation and water level proxies to estimate emissions, by using bioindication of vegetation communities for water level together with the linear correlation between annual mean water level and GHG fluxes. This approach is demonstrated in the Drentsche Aa brook valley in The Netherlands, where peatlands were rewetted to restore rich fen vegetation. Biodiversity of the landscape was monitored by repeated vegetation mapping before and after rewetting, which enables the estimation of emissions reduction as a co-benefit. Mean annual water level values are assigned to mapped vegetation types using existing data on water level dynamics from measurements on corresponding plant communities. GHG emissions are estimated using linear regression models of gas fluxes against mean annual water levels. This approach provides spatially explicit and quantitative estimation of mean annual water levels and GHG fluxes. When combined with information on spatial patterns and variances, the resulting estimations can promote recognition of the carbon co-benefits of biodiversity restoration while facilitating more site-specific optimisation of management practices.

AB Mires forming an ecohydrological gradient from nutrient-rich, groundwater-fed mesotrophic and oligotrophic fens to a nutrient-poor ombrotrophic bog were studied by comparing potential methane (CH4) production and methanogenic microbial communities. Methane production was measured from different depths of anoxic peat and methanogen communities were detected by detailed restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of clone libraries, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Potential CH4 production changed along the ecohydrological gradient with the fens displaying much higher production than the ombrotrophic bog. Methanogen diversity also decreased along the gradient. The two fens had very similar diversity of methanogenic methyl-coenzyme M reductase gene (mcrA), but in the upper layer of the bog the methanogen diversity was strikingly lower, and only one type of mcrA sequence was retrieved. It was related to the Fen cluster, a group of novel methanogenic sequences found earlier in Finnish mires. Bacterial 16S rDNA sequences from the fens fell into at least nine phyla, but only four phyla were retrieved from the bog. The most common bacterial groups were Deltaproteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Acidobacteria.

AB Mineral roads in peatlands change the nature of the substrate, influence the water table level of the peatland on either side of the road and the physicochemical characteristics of the water and peat. These changes can in turn affect plant community composition. The efficiency of an innovative and affordable method for the restoration of peatlands impacted by roads was evaluated: the Burial Under Peat Technique. To be considered effective from an ecological point of view, the technique should meet restoration goals by 1) confining the chemical elements and compounds potentially leaching from the mineral material; 2) creating and maintaining a restored surface elevation similar to the adjacent peatland for optimal rewetting; and 3) re-establishing typical peatland vegetation communities. Three years post-restoration, water sampled at various depths and distances to the buried road presented chemical elements and compounds concentrations similar to the means measured in the pristine surrounding peatland for most of the ions analyzed. The different steps of the technique ensured the reestablishment of an elevation similar to the surrounding peatland. The return of peatland plant communities was slow, mainly due to local factors (e.g., presence of drainage ditches). Furthermore, the Burial Under Peat Technique fulfilled the restoration objectives in re-establishing an acid organic soil. Finally, it is a cost-effective method in comparison to completely removing the mineral material and transporting new material to fill the depression left by the excavation of the road.

AB Vegetation switches are those processes in which there is positive-feedback between vegetation and environment, i.e. a vegetation state modifies its environment producing conditions more favourable to itself (Wilson & Agnew 1992). Switches can produce and maintain abrupt ecotones between plant communities.
   Such a sharp ecotone exists between beech-podocarp forest and mire vegetation, both on deep peat, in southwest New Zealand. One such site was examined. There was no apparent explanation for the ecotone in the present topography nor in the substrate.
   Levelled transects through the forest demonstrated that most seedling establishment occurred on dead fallen tree boles. These microsites were significantly richer in N, P and K than die wet sump microsites. We argue that this is a mechanism whereby trees can become established in the forest, but not in die open mire. In the forest, the presence of trees ensures the presence of dead-log microsites on the ground, permitting tree seedlings to grow. In the mire, there are no such microsites, and trees cannot establish.
   The ecotone may be sharpened because of the presence of an ecotonal band of the small tree Leptospermum scoparium between forest and mire. This species can reproduce vegetatively by root suckers in the mire. Its boles are light, and even if they fall to the mire surface they are not thick enough to form a substrate for tree-seedling establishment. The larger tree species may be prevented from falling onto the mire by the wind-sheltering of the forest, and by the zone of Leptospermum.
   The postulated process would represent a new kind of water-/nutrient-mediated switch, of Type 1 ('One-sided'). It may occur in many waterlogged forests worldwide.

AB To elucidate the roles of hydrology and vegetation in belowground carbon cycling within peatlands, radiocarbon values were obtained for pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CH4, and peat from the Glacial Lake Agassiz peatland. The major implication of this work is that the rate of microbial respiration within a peat column is greater than the peat decomposition rate. The radiocarbon content of DOC at both bog and fen was enriched relative to solid-phase peat by similar to 150-300 parts per thousand consistent with the advection of recently photosynthesized DOC downward into the peat column. Fen Delta C-14 values for DIC and CH4 closely track the Delta C-14 of pore water DOC at depth, indicating that this recent plant production was the predominant substrate for microbial respiration. Aceticlastic methanogenesis apparently dominated the upper third of the peat column (alpha = 1.05), shifting toward CO2 reduction with depth (1.05 < <alpha> < 1.08). Upwelling groundwater contributed as much as 15% of the DIC to the bulk DIC pool at depth in the fen. The similarity of <Delta>C-14 values for DIC and CH4 suggests that methanogens utilized DIC from this source as well as DIC produced in situ. Bog Delta C-14 values for pore water DIC and CH4 differ by less than or equal to 15 parts per thousand at all depths and are depleted in C-14 relative to DOC by similar to 100 parts per thousand, suggesting microbial utilization of a mixture of older and modern substrate. CO2 reduction was the primary pathway for methanogenesis at all depths in the bog (a = 1.08), and groundwater influence on bulk DIC was negligible. For bath sites, Delta C-14-DIC and Delta C-14-CH4 are approximately equal at depths where stable isotope data indicate a predominance of CO2 reduction and dissimilar when acetate fermentation is indicated.

AB Wetlands in general and mires in particular belong to the most important terrestrial carbon stocks globally. Mires (i.e. bogs, transition bogs and fens) are assumed to be especially vulnerable to climate change because they depend on specific, namely cool and humid, climatic conditions. In this paper, we use distribution data of the nine mire types to be found in Austria and habitat distribution models for four IPCC scenarios to evaluate climate change induced risks for mire ecosystems within the 21st century. We found that climatic factors substantially contribute to explain the current distribution of all nine Austrian mire ecosystem types. Summer temperature proved to be the most important predictor for the majority of mire ecosystems. Precipitation-mostly spring and summer precipitation sums-was influential for some mire ecosystem types which depend partly or entirely on ground water supply (e.g. fens). We found severe climate change induced risks for all mire ecosystems, with rain-fed bog ecosystems being most threatened. Differences between scenarios are moderate for the mid-21st century, but become more pronounced towards the end of the 21st century, with near total loss of climate space projected for some ecosystem types (bogs, quagmires) under severe climate change. Our results imply that even under minimum expected, i.e. inevitable climate change, climatic risks for mires in Austria will be considerable. Nevertheless, the pronounced differences in projected habitat loss between moderate and severe climate change scenarios indicate that limiting future warming will likely contribute to enhance long-term survival of mire ecosystems, and to reduce future greenhouse gas emissions from decomposing peat. Effectively stopping and reversing the deterioration of mire ecosystems caused by conventional threats can be regarded as a contribution to climate change mitigation. Because hydrologically intact mires are more resilient to climatic changes, this would also maintain the nature conservation value of mires, and help to reduce the severe climatic risks to which most Austrian mire ecosystems may be exposed in the 2nd half of the 21st century according to IPCC scenarios.

AB Northern peatlands store a globally significant amount of soil organic carbon, much of it found in rapidly thawing permafrost. Permafrost thaw in peatlands often leads to the development and expansion of thermokarst bogs, where microbial activity will determine the stability of the carbon storage and the release of greenhouse gases. In this study, we compared potential enzyme activities between young (thawed similar to 30 years ago) and mature (similar to 200 years) thermokarst bogs, for both shallow and deep peat layers. We found very low potential enzyme activities in deep peat layers, with no differences between the young and mature bogs. Peat quality at depth was found to be highly humified (FTIR analysis) in both the young and mature bogs. This suggests that deep, old peat was largely stable following permafrost thaw, without a rapid pulse of decomposition during the young bog stage. For near-surface peat, we found significantly higher potential enzyme activities in the young bog than in the mature-associated with differences in peat quality derived from different Sphagnum species. A laboratory incubation of near-surface peat showed that differences in potential enzyme activity were primarily influenced by peat type rather than oxygen availability. This suggested that the young bog can have higher rates of near-surface decomposition despite being substantially wetter than the mature bog. Overall, our study shows that peat properties are the dominant constraint on potential enzyme activity and that peatland site development (successional pathways and permafrost history) through its influence on peat type and chemistry is likely to determine peat decomposition following permafrost thaw.

AB Canada's Boreal Plains peatland vegetation species assemblages are characterized by their functional ecosystem roles and feedbacks, which are important for carbon and water storage in a sub-humid climate. The vegetation communities at the peatland-upland interface, or the peatland margin ecotone, have not been extensively delineated or characterized as a distinct ecotone. Because these ecotones constitute a smouldering hotspot during wildfire, with carbon loss from these margins accounting for 50-90% of total peatland carbon loss, their delineation is critical. Post-fire, areas of severe peat smouldering have previously been shown to undergo shifts in vegetation community composition, resulting in a loss of key peatland ecohydrological functions. The aim of this study was to delineate Boreal Plains peatland margin ecotones and assess their prevalence across the landscape. Using split moving window analysis on vegetation transect data from a chronosequence of study sites, the margin ecotones were delineated at sites having different times since fire. No significant differences were identified in margin width over time or margin peat depths across hydrogeological settings. However, with peat depths of up to 2.46m in small peatlands characteristic of moraine and glaciofluvial deposits, vulnerable margin peat has been demonstrated to represent a significant carbon store. Fire managers employing peatland fuel treatments for wildfire abatement and community protection should consider these confined peatlands more carefully to mitigate catastrophic carbon losses. Further, we suggest that a greater understanding is needed of the roles of peatland margin ecotones in sustaining peatland autogenic feedback mechanisms that promote paludification and recovery following wildfire.

TI Sphagnum peatland development at their southern climatic range in West

AB A region of western Siberia is vulnerable to the predicted climatic change which may induce an important modification to the carbon balance in wetland ecosystems. This study focuses on the evaluation of both the long-term and contemporary trends of peat (carbon) accumulation and its patterns at the southern climatic range of Sphagnum peatlands in western Siberia. Visible and physical features of peat and detailed reconstructions of successional change (or sediment stratigraphies) were analysed at two types of forest -peatland ecotones, which are situated close to each other but differ by topography and composition of their plant communities. Our results suggest that Siberian peatlands exhibit a general trend towards being a carbon sink rather than a source even at or near the southern limit of their distribution. Furthermore, two types of peat accumulation were detected in the study area, namely persistent and intermittent. As opposed to persistent peat accumulation, the intermittent one is characterized by the recurrent degradation of the upper peat layers at the marginal parts of raised bogs. Persistent peat accumulation is the case for the majority of Sphagnum peatlands under current climatic conditions. It might be assumed that more peat will accumulate under the ' increased precipitation' scenarios of global warming, although intermittent peat accumulation could result in the eventual drying that may change peatlands from carbon sinks to carbon sources.

AB The aim of this study was to determine the effect of drainage on peat properties, porewater chemistry, and peat decomposition proxies in an ombrogenous peatland in the Hudson Bay Lowland (HBL). We anticipated that drainage would change peatland hydrology, vegetation, and biogeochemistry, leading to an increase in peat decomposition. As indicators of peat biogeochemical change and potential proxies for peat decomposition, we compared peat porewater chemistry and in situ nutrient availability of different microforms in a pristine ombrogenous bog, with a bog that has been subject to gradual lowering of the water table by 20 to 80 cm for approximately 7 years prior to, and during, our study. We also examined the chemical composition of peat and peat leachates (organic matter) fromSphagnumand lichen-covered hummocks at each site. Nutrient availability was greater in pools at the drained bog, indicating mineralisation of the dry and bare peat surface. However, our results did not show evidence of significant peat biogeochemical change or advanced decomposition in hummocks at the drained bog, with no difference in nutrient availabilities, peat porewater chemistry, or peat leachate chemistry at the drained and pristine bog. We also found no significant difference in enzyme activity (phenol oxidases) in hummocks at each site, proposed to be an important factor for C loss from peatland ecosystems in drier conditions. Overall, the effects of drainage on peat properties, porewater chemistry, and peat chemical composition at our sites were small and varied for different vegetation-microform types. Although decomposition in drained peatlands is likely constrained by cool temperatures in the HBL, our results suggest that ecohydrological feedbacks at the microform scale may also be important in slowing decomposition in these peatlands.

AB At the global scale peatlands are an important sod organic carbon (SOC) pool. They sequester, store and emit carbon dioxide and methane and have a large carbon content per unit area. In Ireland, peatlands cover between 17% and 20% of the land area and contain a significant, but poorly quantified amount of SOC. Peatlands may function as a persistent sink for atmospheric CO2. In Ireland the detailed information that is required to calculate the peatland SOC pool, such as peat depth, area and carbon density, is inconsistent in quality and coverage. The objective of this research was to develop an improved method for estimating the depth of blanket peat from elevation, slope and disturbance data to allow more accurate estimations of the SOC pool for blanket peatlands. The model was formulated to predict peat depth at a resolution of 100 ha (1 km(2)). The model correctly captured the trend and accounted for 58 to 63% of the observed variation in peat depth in the Wicklow Mountains on the east coast of Ireland. Given that the surface of a blanket peatland masks unknown undulations at the mineral/peat interface this was a successful outcome. Using the peat depth model, it was estimated that blanket peatland in the Wicklow Mountains contained 230 Mt of carbon. This compares to the previously published values ranging from 0.45 Mt C to 2.18 Mt C. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study summarizes the present knowledge of Finnish peatland areas and carbon (C) storage in peat from 1950 to 2000. In 1950, approximately 8.8 million ha of the Finnish peatland area was still undisturbed and 1.4 million ha drained. In 2000, almost 55% (5.7 million ha) of the peatland area in Finland was drained for forestry, 38.4% (4.0 million ha) was undrained, 0.8% (85 000 ha) was in agriculture, 0.6% (60 000 ha) was under water reservoirs, 0.3% (35 000 ha) was under roads and 0.6% was in peat harvesting or had been removed from the harvesting business (63 000 ha). The change in mire area is considered relatively reliable, whereas the net changes in the actual C sequestration and the actual C storage change from 1950 to 2000 involves much more uncertainty. In 2000, the total C storage of Finnish peatland ecosystems was estimated at 5960 Tg, which includes 5304 Tg as peat. Since 1950, the C sequestration of undrained and drained peatlands (peat, plant biomass) basically compensated for the anthropogenic losses. The most important forms of anthropogenic C losses have occurred from agricultural peat soils, water reservoirs, harvested peat and DOC output from forestry drained peatlands. From 1950 to 2000, the total C storage of Finnish peatlands, which includes peat and living plant biomass, was estimated to increased by 52 Tg because the intensive peatland drainage significantly increased the total C storage of vegetation. However, the actual C storage in peat decreased by about 73 Tg. The well-defined changes include the decrease of mire diversity because of forestry drainage.

AB To date, the areal extent, carbon pools, rate of carbon accumulation, and role of peatlands of the former Soviet Union (FSU) in the terrestrial carbon cycle has not been fully recognized. This is a consequence of the fact that many peatlands in the FSU, especially noncommercial peatlands, were never studied and properly mapped. An estimate of the areal extent, carbon pools, and rate of carbon accumulation in peatlands of the FSU obtained by interrelating a number of regional databases and maps, including formerly classified maps, is presented herein. Commercial peatlands were categorized by regional type which facilitated an evaluation of their age and quality. Noncommercial peatlands were evaluated from classified regional topographic maps. Air photographs were used to identify peatIands of northern landscapes. The total peatland area of the FSU was estimated at 165 Mba (10(6) hectares) which was two times greater than the most recent estimates based on thematic maps. The peat carbon pool was estimated at 215 Pg C. Half of this amount was in raised bogs. The rate of peat accumulation varied from 12 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (polygonal mires) to 72-80 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (fens and marshes). The total rate of carbon accumulation in FSU peatlands was 52 Tg C yr(-1). Carbon emissions from peat utilization in the FSU were estimated at 122 Tg C yr(-1). Thus, at present, peat accumulation/utilization in the FSU is a net source of approximately 70 Tg C yr(-1) to the atmosphere.

AB Peatland was subject to heavy drainage and degradation throughout the world and thus is now the focus of large scale restoration attempts. The monitoring of both vegetation development and balance of matter after restoration has started is indispensable, since an important objective of peatlands rewetting is the rehabilitation of their sink function. Against this background, we investigated rewetted fens in NE Germany in order to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the vegetation development after restoration measures. The aim of this study was to analyse the vegetation composition with multispectral and very high spatial resolution satellite imagery. We investigated two sites with different rewetting dates and also took biomass and carbon content samples for the main plant species in order to estimate nutrient storage. We tested the applicability of various satellite sensors (QuickBird, WorldView I and SPOT) and an iterative classification scheme based on decision trees for mapping several wetland plant species (e. g. Phragmites australis, Typha spp. and Carex spp.) and vegetation types. We chose three different widely used decision tree classifiers for this study: AdaBoost, See5 and Random Forest. Evaluation criteria were overall accuracy and mean class accuracy. Multispectral and very high spatial resolution satellite data and the developed method allow for the identification of the most important vegetation types in rewetted fens. All applied sensors yielded good results with overall accuracies of 85% and 92%. Some classes reached lower accuracies due to different reasons (capture date, size of training set or spatial resolution of the sensor). We found remote sensing a very valuable tool not only for the observation of the restoration success in rewetted peatland but also for the analysis of the peat accumulation potential as well as biomass and nutrient storage.

AB Nutrient availability is an important control on the vegetation distribution, productivity and functioning of peatland ecosystems and we examined spatial and temporal patterns of nutrient availability through ion exchange at Mer Bleue bog, southeast Ontario, Canada. We installed ion exchange probes at 5-15 cm for 4 weeks and determined nutrient sorption at undisturbed sites as well as those affected by nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) fertilization and drainage. Under undisturbed conditions, the bog had very small amount of available nutrients, especially N(ammonium > nitrate) and P, and exhibited small variations in nutrient availability during the growing season (May to October). The increase in NPK availability upon fertilization was short-lived over the season and the stoichiometry of available NPK captured by the probes was mismatched with the vegetation. The increase in nutrient availability with drainage was confounded by substantial changes in vegetation. We compare these results with data from other Canadian bogs and fens to provide baseline data on nutrient availability in peatlands. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of fires on conservation values and in determining present-day vegetation are poorly known in New Zealand. This study of vegetation recovery at Awarua Bog, Southland, began after a fire in 1985, Nine samplings were recorded over 10 years from permanent transects in six vegetation types: mixed Batimea-Empodisma bog, Leptospermum scrub. Pteridium fernland, Sphagnum bog, Chionochloa grassland, and Ulex scrub. Rapid initial vegetative regrowth was mainly by rhizomatous species. Low-growing species (herbaceous dicotyledons, grasses, bryophytes) peaked in abundance 15-22 months after fire but subsequently declined in cover or disappeared. Leptospermum shrubs established rapidly from seed; epacrid shrub species established later and more slowly. Former dominants (e.g., Empodisma minus, Gleichenia dicarpa, and Chionochloa rubra) were slow to recover. Sphagnum recovery was mainly by slow recolonisation of fire-bared peat, rather than regrowth of fire-damaged former cushions. Cushion bog (Donatia novae-zelandiae) is particularly sensitive to fire and very slow to recover. Fire provides open sites for gorse (Ulex europaeus) establishment, but also easy access for its eradication, Long-term fire prevention and prompt containment protect conservation values.

AB Three Upper Miocene (Pontian) lignite seams are present in the Smederevsko Pomoravlje field (Kostolac Basin, Serbia). The origin of their organic matter (OM), the characteristics of the depositional environment and certain utilisation properties have been evaluated based on petrographic data, bulk organic geochemical parameters, biomarker patterns and their isotope signatures. Moreover, results of isotopic analysis were used for the investigation of the influence of diagenetic aromatisation on delta C-13 signatures of biomarkers.
   The studied lignites are typical humic coals. The OM of lignites is derived from woody vegetation and herbaceous peat-forming plants, with a strong prevalence of the former. The peat-forming vegetation is dominated by decay resistant conifers, including gymnosperm families Cupressaceae, Taxodiaceae, and Pinaceae. Angiosperms occurred in lower amounts. Minor contribution of ferns, fungi and emergent aquatic macrophyta to the biomass is also evident. Chemoautotrophic- and heterotrophic bacteria played an import role during diagenesis. Diagenetic alterations, associated with change in the number of carbon atoms, influence delta C-13 ratios. Diagenetic aromatisation of di- and non-hopanoid triterpenoids is accompanied with C-13 depletion, whereas aromatisation of hopanoids displays the opposite trend.
   Peatification proceeded in a fresh water environment under variable, anoxic to slightly oxic redox conditions. The lowermost coal seam III accumulated in a topogenous fresh water peat mire with open water areas, which changed occasionally into a wet forest swamp. This resulted in the deposition of mineral-rich coal. The characteristics of lignite in coal seam II are similar to those of coal seam III. This is supported also by generally similar delta C-13 values of individual biomarkers. Coal seam I is dominated by xylite-rich coal, formed under mesotrophic to ombrotrophic conditions. Rapid flooding of the bogs stopped peat growth in all three coal seams. The ratios of ring-A-degraded and non-degraded aromatic diterpenoids and non-hopanoid triterpenoids, proposed in this study, as well as degree of aromatisation of these biomarkers, reflect changes in the water table.
   Calorific values of the samples indicate that they meet basic requirements for utilisation in the thermal power plants. None of the lignite samples is suitable for coal briquetting, whereas, based on petrographic data, lignite from coal seam I possesses certain potential for fluidized bed gasification.

AB Peatland plant communities surrounding small (< 200 ha) boreal ponds were characterized by indicator species, water and peat chemistry, and diversity. Peatland-pond complexes are common in boreal Alberta and are found in three different landforms (clay-till plain, outwash plain, and moraine). Pond area and perimeter were larger in the clay-till plain than in other landforms, although not significantly different. Across the three landforms, cluster analysis detected five peatland communities: marshes, wet open fens, dry open fens, treed fens, and bogs. The zonation pattern of communities surrounding the ponds varied at all sites, and there was no typical pattern, except that marshes were always found closest to water. Based on the bryophyte species, most communities are considered moderate-rich fens. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling indicated communities fell along a wet-to-dry gradient and a bare-to-vegetated gradient. Water depth and temperature, peat depth, and peat C/N ratios differed between open and treed peatland communities, and pH was similar in all communities. Alpha and gamma diversity was highest in the treed fen and lowest in the marsh community in both total species and bryophyte species. The total number of plant species, some of which are considered rare, found in all communities was 139.

AB Ombrotrophic peatlands (bogs) act as important terrestrial sinks of organic carbon (C). These ecosystems are widespread in coastal maritime regions of eastern Canada. This study aims to evaluate and compare Holocene peatland C dynamics between two maritime ecoclimatic regions along the St. Lawrence North Shore. The investigated bogs are located on two postglacial deltas along the Estuary (Baie-Comeau) and the Gulf of St Lawrence (Havre-St-Pierre) in eastern Quebec. Long-term apparent rates of C accumulation (LORCA) are calculated for eight peat cores, and temporal variations in C accumulation are compared between six peatlands. Our data suggest that long-term C sequestration is affected by a constant anoxic decay, but the LORCA are considerably lower in Havre-St-Pierre (16-46 g C/m(2)/yr) than in Baie-Comeau (53-68 g C/m(2)/yr). The interactions between water table levels, peat humification and C accumulation are also evaluated and suggest an influence of internal (autogenic) processes and feedbacks. The bogs of the two regions show distinct patterns of C sequestration and different sensitivities to climate especially during the late Holocene. These results show that in spite of the internal influences, the regional climate has exerted a pervasive control on primary production in these peatlands over the Holocene.

AB This paper presents reconstruction of lake/mire vegetation changes recorded in a continuous profile, which spans the Late Pleniglacial and Late Glacial in south-eastern Poland. This is done on the basis of pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs), plant macrofossils and diatom evidence. Initially, a small eutrophic lake, which originated and developed through permafrost thawing, existed at the site from ca. 14,910 cal. BP. The lake was characterized by mass algae blooms and wide taxonomic diversity of Potamogeton representatives. The succession of submersed macrophytes started with the appearance of Characeae and ranged from communities composed of taxa preferring alkaline conditions and the thin organic layer at the bottom, such as Potamogeton filiformis and Potamogeton praelongus, to those requiring alkaline-neutral waters with a thick organic layer (e.g. Potamogeton alpinus, Potamogeton friesii, Potamogeton obtusifolius and Potamogeton pectinatus). Despite the alkaline pH of water in the lake, there were also suitable niches for Nuphar pumila, a taxon associated with acidic waters. About 13,730 cal. BP a rich fen developed within the lake basin where Carex was prevalent, with more oligotrophic patches being occupied by Sphagnum mosses. The water table of this mire fluctuated, which is visible in the irregular occurrences of NPPs suited to an aquatic environment. The local vegetation points to slightly alkaline conditions on the fen. An eutrophic water body reappeared ca. 12,700 cal. BP and was functioning at least until ca. 11,620 cal. BP. This alteration of palaeoecosystem created niches for Ranunculus sceleratus in the shoreline section of the water body. The algae content and Potamogeton diversity was significantly smaller than in the water body that had existed there during the Late Pleniglacial and early Late Glacial. The succession of submersed macrophytes was the reverse of that of the initial water body. Taxa preferring more neutral-acidic conditions, such as P. alpinus, appeared at the onset of the renewed lake. Together with the accumulation of a layer of calcareous-detritus gyttja there was the spread of more 'alkaline' taxa, such as P. pectinatus and Myriophyllum spicatum. The present study revealed a lack of diatoms in the deposits along the entire length of the profile. In the case of peat section it stems from limited niches for their occurrence in fen habitats and their consequent low concentrations in peat deposits. However, the problem of the diatoms' absence in lacustrine sediments remains unsolved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB The production and decomposition of organic matter are major processes determining peat accumulation dynamics, both of which vary over different time scales. Here we evaluate three types of experimental and observational data related to peatlands, which are from litter, oxic (acrotelm) peat, and anoxic (catotelm) peat. The Pb-210-dated peat-core profiles for the last 100-200 years are used to understand the oxic decomposition processes; C-14-dated peat profiles for the last several millennia are used for understanding anoxic decomposition processes. Analysis of data from litter-bag experiments suggests that a significant portion of the litter is lost in the first few years owing primarily to rapid initial decomposition processes, including movement/leaching of soluble materials. This is also confirmed indirectly by Pb-210-dated peat-core data. Several records of acrotelm peat show similar estimated litter-addition (265 +/- 37.3 g m (-2) year (-1)) and decay rates (0.017 +/- 0.0047 year (-1)), despite the climatic difference among study areas. The litter-addition rate of 255 g m (-2) year (-1) is at most about half of measured net primary production. Warmer climate causes higher production but also higher decomposition. The balance of production and decay processes in the litter and acrotelm determines the peat addition rate to the catotelm, where long-term peat accumulation occurs. Our sensitivity analysis shows that change in the peat-addition rate would affect both young and old peat; in contrast, a change in the decay rate has more influence on old peat. We therefore hypothesize that the wiggles often seen in peat age-depth profiles are caused by changes in peat addition rates, which are determined by climatically sensitive processes including photosynthesis and acrotelm decomposition. Evaluating these litter and peat-core data provides insights useful to the design and implementation of a peatland dynamics simulation model. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pitcher plant bogs of the Little River Canyon National Preserve in northern Alabama contain the federally endangered green pitcher plant (Sarracenia oreophila (Kearney) Wherry). Multivariate analysis of the bog vegetation and environmental variables revealed three communities with unique species compositions and soil characteristics. The significant soil characteristics were percent A-horizon sand and A-horizon depth. A blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica Marsh.)-yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.)-azalea (Rhododendron canescens (Michx.) Sweet) type was found on sites bisected by ephemeral streams with a closed canopy. A scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea Muenchh.)-flowering dogwood (Cornus florida L.)-sweet goldenrod (Solidago speciosa Nutt. var. erecta (Pursh) MacM.) type was found on upland sites close to the canyon rim and along perennial streams sites. A smooth yellow false foxglove (Aureolaria flava (L.) Farw.)-pale-spike lobelia (Lobelia spicata Lam.)-violet lespedeza (Lespedeza violacea (L.) Pets. type was found on relatively flat sites away from the canyon rim. The results can be used to locate potential sites for restoration of green pitcher plant bogs. Survival of the bogs is threatened by encroachment of over and midstory vegetation.

AB Northern peatlands represent important stocks of organic carbon (C). Peatland C dynamics have the potential to influence atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and are therefore of interest concerning future climate change. Quantification of Holocene variations in peat C accumulation rates is often based on a single, deep core. However, deep cores may overestimate accumulation rates when extrapolated to the ecosystem scale. We propose a reconstruction of C sequestration patterns based on multiple cores from three ombrotrophic peatlands in boreal Quebec, Canada. Both total C accumulation and temporal variations herein were quantified. Radiocarbon-dated stratigraphies from different sections resulted in peatland-specific age-depth models. Peatland initiation started rapidly after deglaciation around 7500 cal BP. Vertical accumulation slowed down in the course of the Holocene, whereas lateral expansion was rapid in the early stages but slowed down near mid-Holocene. Total C accumulation showed maximum rates between 5250 and 3500 cal BP with a regional mean Holocene apparent rate of 16.2 g m(-2) yr(-1). The Eastmain peatlands have been modest sinks of organic C compared to those of Alaska, western Canada, and western Siberia, although differences in calculation methods hamper direct comparisons. Considering within-peatland dynamics, maximum total C sequestration coincided with a period of slowing down in both lateral expansion and vertical accumulation. Late-Holocene diminishing peatland C sink functions have been attributed to autogenic as well as allogenic factors. Height-induced surface drying and/or neoglacial cooling effects may have forced the slowing down of C sequestration in the studied bogs. Results further show that, in order to obtain an accurate quantification of past C sequestration, reconstructions of peatland expansion are essential.

AB Aim Biogeographers increasingly realize the importance of seeing plant communities as spatial mosaics and understanding the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of a site is often a key to successful conservation. The aim of this paper is to examine the approaches to the description and analysis of spatial and temporal variation in sub-communities within patch mosaics of vegetation in order to inform conservation management. The activities of the tin streaming industry in Cornwall over the last century have created a highly varied mosaic of poor fen vegetation on Goss Moor National Nature Reserve (NNR). The wetland mosaics comprise dry hummocks and different sized wet pools. The size and depth of the pools determines the rate and type of vegetation that develops, as does the nature of boundary or edge. The ergodic hypothesis is used to describe the various plant sub-communities and their boundaries to identify pathways of hydroseral succession. A further aim was to test the use of Ellenberg Indicator (EI) values as a tool for the rapid description of spatial and temporal environmental change on wetland sites with a view to their management.
   Location Goss Moor National Nature Reserve, Cornwall, UK.
   Methods An extensive survey of the whole wetland complex was undertaken to identify patches of poor fen vegetation containing Potentilla palustris (L.) Scop. and Menyanthes trifoliata L. At each patch, species abundance data were collected as well as associated environmental information such as depth of the organic layer and standing water depth, patch location, patch size and boundary type. The plant sub-communities present were defined using techniques of numerical classification [two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN)] and ordination [detrended correspondence analysis (DCA)] and these were ordered using the ergodic hypothesis in order to characterize the stages of the hydrosere. Floristic and environmental relationships were examined using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Further environmental differences between the poor fen sub-community types were characterized by weighted EI values for acidity (R), moisture (F), nitrogen (N) and light (L).
   Results and conclusions Twelve poor fen sub-community types were described and found to be distributed along a primary environmental gradient of organic matter depth, surface water height and bare substrate. Separation of the poor fen communities by a moisture gradient was considered as spatial evidence for hydroseral succession, which begins with the colonization of open-water pools created by tin excavations. High water levels were associated with the swamp communities, increased organic depth was associated with poor fen, and the type of boundary was shown to affect the resulting community composition. Weighted Community Ellenberg Indicator values for nitrogen, light, reaction and moisture are recommended as an effective tool for indicating differences between plant (sub-)communities. The importance of examining sub- community mosaics in the study of hydroseral development is stressed and the manner in which both sets of information may be used to underpin the conservation management of the site is demonstrated.

AB Growing public interest in conserving peatlands has created a need for restoration and rapid indicators of progress in peat formation. Vegetation and hydrological indicators are commonly assessed, but changes in mineralization and decomposition rates might better indicate when peat formation is underway in restored peatlands. In Finland, we investigated differences in mineralization and decomposition in the upper peat layer of five undrained and eight drained Pinus-dominated fens from 2006 to 2009. Forestry-drained fens were restored in 2007 by harvesting either whole trees or only stems, and by damming and filling ditches. Before restoration, net N mineralization rate was slightly higher in the drained than in undrained fens, whereas soil pH and Betula leaf litter decomposition rate were lower. After restoration, net N mineralization rate was similar for the undrained and restored fens, except near ditches after stem harvest. Also, soil pH and decomposition rate of Betula leaf litter became similar for undrained and restored fens. We conclude that whole tree harvest is a more suitable method for peatland restoration than stem harvest and that mineralization and decomposition rates are suitable indicators for peat formation after restoration.

AB Measurements of CH3Br exchange at two New Hampshire peatlands (Sallie's Fen and Angie's Bog) indicate that net flux from these ecosystems is the sum of competing production and consumption processes. Net CH3Br fluxes were highly variable and ranged from net emission to net uptake between locations within a single peatland. At Sallie's Fen, net CH3Br flux exhibited positive correlations with peat temperature and air temperature during all seasons sampled, but these relationships were not observed at Angie's Bog where flux varied according to microtopography. The major CH3Br production process at Sallie's Fen appeared dependent on aerobic conditions within the peat, while CH3Br production at Angie's Bog was favored by anaerobic conditions. There was evidence of aerobic microbial consumption of CH3Br within the peat at both sites. In a vegetation removal experiment conducted at Sallie's Fen with dynamic chambers, all collars exhibited net consumption of CH3Br. Net CH3Br flux had a negative correlation with surface temperature and a positive correlation with water level in collars with all vegetation clipped consistent with aerobic microbial consumption. Vegetated collars showed positive correlations between net CH3Br flux and air temperature. A positive correlation between net CH3Br flux and surface temperature was also observed in collars in which all vegetation except Sphagnum spp. were clipped. These correlations are consistent with seasonal relationships observed in 1998, 1999, and 2000 and suggest that plants and/or fungi are possible sources of CH3Br in peatlands. Estimates of production and consumption made on two occasions at Sallie's Fen suggest that peatlands have lower rates of CH3Br consumption compared to upland ecosystems, but a close balance between production and consumption rates may allow these wetlands to act as either a net source or sink for this gas.

AB Peatlands comprise a globally important carbon pool whose input-output budgets may be significantly altered by climate change. To experimentally determine the sensitivity of the carbon stored in peatlands to climate change, we constructed a mesocosm facility with 54 peat monoliths from a bog and fen in northern Minnesota, USA. These mesocosms were subjected to nine combinations of heat and water-table levels over eight years. Bog mesocosms initially accumulated soil carbon, with greater gains in wetter mesocosms, but after three years no further water-table effects occurred. In contrast, fen mesocosms lost or had no change in soil carbon, with the greatest losses in drier and warmer mesocosms. Changes in soil-carbon storage resulted in concomitant changes in water-table depth, so that water-table depths were similar to those in the natural source sites by the end of the experiment regardless of the initial treatment. These results were primarily due to water-table effects on Sphagnum moss production in the bog mesocosms and to a more complicated suite of warming and water-table effects on production and decomposition in the fen mesocosms. We show that different kinds of peatlands will rapidly gain or lose carbon following hydrological disturbance until they return to their characteristic ("equilibrium'') water-table levels. Our results illustrate the potential for a rapid homeostatic response of these ecosystems to future climate change at small spatial scales. Climate change will likely also interact with other carbon cycle-hydrological feedbacks at the scale of the entire peatland over longer time frames and larger spatial scales.

AB The species composition of 22 mires (brown-moss rich fens) was surveyed in north-eastern Poland, located in continental boreo-nemoral Europe. Detailed analyses of the water chemistry, biomass N, P, and K content, productivity and water level were made. Two floristically different types of rich-fen vegetation occur in this area, one with numerous Caricetalia davallianae (calcicole) species such as Scorpidium cossonii, Campylium stellatum, Carex lepidocarpa and Eriophorum latifolium (Cd fens) and the other with a few Caricetalia davallianae species and mainly Hamatocaulis vernicosus, Marchantia polymorpha, Plagiomnium ellipticum, Carex diandra and C. rostrata (non-Cd fens). In these two rich-fen types surface water chemistry and water levels were similar, but the Cd fens characteristically had higher pHs and lower PO43- concentrations. N and P availability revealed by the N:P ratio is the ecological factor that best accounts for the differences in species composition of the two rich-fen types: the non-Cd fens are N-limited while the Cd-fens are usually P-limited. Moreover, the Cd fens differ from the non-Cd fens in a higher productivity of the bryophyte layer. In the case of P and K concentrations, there is a correlation between that in vascular plants and bryophytes, while N concentrations are not correlated. We believe that in the case of low productive ecosystems the use of the broad "nutrient availability gradient" should be replaced by a (from) N-(to) P-limitation gradient with N:P ratio as a useful measure. Natural N-limited, low-productive rich fens and their ecological conditions can be a phenomenon typical of continentaleastern temperate European areas, which have been poorly surveyed and need further research.

AB Groundwater-fed fens are known sources of methane (CH4) emissions to the atmosphere, and these are known to be mediated by the vegetation. In a fen located in the Bale Mountains, Ethiopia, we assessed the effects of a cushion plant (Eriocaulon schimperi) and a sedge (Carex monostachya) on rhizosphere biogeochemistry.
   Methane and CO2 concentrations and pH were measured in pore-water at different depths in the profile. Redox potentials and NaCl-extractable element concentrations were analysed in soil samples from sites dominated by either E. schimperii or C. monostachya. Nutrient and element concentration were analysed in plant tissues.
   At Carex-dominated sites, CH4 concentrations increased from 70 mu mol.l(-1) at a depth of 10 cm to 130 mu mol.l(-1) at a depth of 100 cm. CH4 concentrations at Eriocaulon-dominated sites were almost zero (< 1 mu mol.l(-1)) to a depth of 100 cm. Simultaneously, soil redox potentials and CO2 concentrations were higher at Eriocaulon-dominated sites, indicating a low potential for CH4 production and a high potential for CH4 oxidation.
   Eriocaulon schimperi displayed a root investment strategy to cope with the harsh environment, similar to the cushion plant Astelia pumila in Patagonian bogs. This strategy is characterised by high root/shoot ratios, high root porosity and density under high redox conditions. Both cushion plant species create an aerobic rhizosphere through radial oxygen loss from deep roots, which strongly reduce CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere.

AB Rising global temperatures tied to increases in greenhouse gas emissions are impacting high latitude regions, leading to changes in vegetation composition and feedbacks to climate through increased methane (CH4) emissions. In subarctic peatlands, permafrost collapse has led to shifts in vegetation species on landscape scales with high spatial heterogeneity. Our goal was to provide a baseline for vegetation distribution related to permafrost collapse and changes in biogeochemical processes. We collected unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery at Stordalen Mire, Abisko, Sweden to classify vegetation cover types. A series of digital image processing routines were used to generate texture attributes within the image for the purpose of characterizing vegetative cover types. An artificial neural network (ANN) was developed to classify the image. The ANN used all texture variables and color bands (three spectral bands and six metrics) to generate a probability map for each of the eight cover classes. We used the highest probability for a class at each pixel to designate the cover type in the final map. Our overall misclassification rate was 32%, while omission and commission error by class ranged from 0% to 50%. We found that within our area of interest, cover classes most indicative of underlying permafrost (hummock and tall shrub) comprised 43.9% percent of the landscape. Our effort showed the capability of an ANN applied to UAS high-resolution imagery to develop a classification that focuses on vegetation types associated with permafrost status and therefore potentially changes in greenhouse gas exchange. We also used a method to examine the multiple probabilities representing cover class prediction at the pixel level to examine model confusion. UAS image collection can be inexpensive and a repeatable avenue to determine vegetation change at high latitudes, which can further be used to estimate and scale corresponding changes in CH4 emissions.

AB Selective inhibition of substrate-induced respiration with antibiotics cycloheximide and streptomycin sulphate provided insight into eukaryotic versus prokaryotic activities in surface peat soil of three Canadian peatlands. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities in peatlands are important in the net sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and therefore play a unique role in global carbon cycling. Selective inhibition techniques were generally successful, with a maximum non-target inhibition of only 17%. Assuming that eukaryotic and prokaryotic activities were dominated by fungi and bacteria respectively, across 3 ecologically and hydrologically diverse and spatially dispersed peatlands, we demonstrated bacterial dominance in a bog and a poor fen both with acidic and primarily Sphagnum derived peat soil and in a near pH neutral wetter rich fen with sedge peat (fungal to bacterial activity ratio = 0.31 to 0.68). These results differ in that in other acidic environments, such as conifer forest soils, fungal to bacterial activity ratios are mostly greater than 1 indicative of fungal dominance.

ID BASALT INTERACTIONS
AB Catchment areas of Icelandic rivers are mostly barren or with little vegetation cover in the highlands, but with heathland and mire vegetation in the lowlands. Chemical composition and nutrient availability in Icelandic rivers are influenced by geology, topography and vegetation cover in the river basins. This seems to determine the density and diversity of benthic invertebrates, species composition of anadromous fish and catch of salmon in Icelandic rivers. Species composition of benthic communities is determined by particulate organic matter drifting downstream from river head-waters. Filter feeding blackfly larvae dominate lake outlets, while algal grazing chironomid larvae dominate rivers not influenced by lakes. In well vegetated catchment basins, lake-fed rivers have higher catches of salmon than non-lake fed rivers. Only a few of the rivers flowing from poorly vegetated areas sustain salmon. Glacial rivers have the lowest density and diversity of benthic invertebrates of all river groups and do not sustain fish populations.

AB Questions
   What impact do a wet and a dry growing season have on CO2 dynamics of mire plant communities along a primary succession gradient from the initiation stage to the bog stage?
   Location
   Mires on a land uplift coast, Finland.
   Methods
   We measured CO2 dynamics and vascular plant green area development on five mires that form a sequence of mire succession. TWINSPAN was used to define successional mire plant communities and regression analyses were used to explore the temporal variation in CO2 dynamics of the communities.
   Results
   CO2 dynamics of successional plant communities reacted differently to a wet and a dry growing season. The net CO2 uptake rate of the earlier successional communities decreased in the dry growing season due to a decrease in photosynthesizing leaf area. Concurrently, CO2 uptake of the later successional communities moderately increased or did not change. Generally, the difference in net ecosystem exchange (NEE) between a dry and a wet year resulted from the altered rate of gross photosynthesis (P-G) rather than ecosystem respiration (R-E).
   Conclusions
   Critical factors for the more stable carbon (C) gas dynamics in the later stages of mire succession were (1) higher autogenic control of the physical environment and (2) an increase in the number of factors regulating the P-G rate. These factors may buffer mire ecosystems (in terms of the C sink function) from extreme and unfavourable variations in environmental conditions.

AB Stratigraphic data on gross peat components, plant macrofossils, pollen, ash after ignition, and radiocarbon ages are used to reconstruct the developmental history of the north unit of Caribou Bog in central Maine, which presently consists of a sparsely wooded, ombrotrophic (raised), center surrounded by extensive wooded fen. A lake existed from 12 500 to 8500 BP, when terrestrialization led to peatland initiation throughout the basin within similar to 500 years. Near the center of the present peatland, limnic sedge fen developed to sedge fen at 8000 BP, and to Larix laricina wooded fen at 7000 BP. At 5500 BP the wooded fen became Sphagnum dominated and sparsely wooded, a condition that has persisted at the peatland center. Only two early transitions are clearly related to climate forcing. An abrupt shift from silt-clay to organic lake sediment similar to 10 400 BP is typical of basins throughout the region. This shift correlates with rapid changes in local and regional vegetation, and likely reflects increased biological productivity caused by a rapid warming of climate. Peatland initiation 8500-8000 BP coincides with a drop of water level, probably associated with a rapid shift to drier climate. We estimate that the water level around the peatland was at least 0.4 m above the present level at and before 8500 BP, dropped at least 1.7 m (min. 1.4 m with correction for peat compaction) in the next 500 years, and rose to the present level around 7000 BP or later. Major hydroseral changes after 8000 BP are asynchronous at several coring sites and are not consistently correlated with regional paleoclimatic events. These changes were probably induced by autogenic hydrological processes associated with peat accumulation.

AB The peatlands of Atlantic Canada are classified in four plant alliances, consisting of 10 plant associations. The four plant alliances comprise the dry bog communities (Kalmio-Cladonion Wells 1981), wet bog communities (Scirpo-Sphagnion Wells 1981), hummock and ridge communities of slope and string fens (Betulo-Sphagnion Wells all. nov.), and poor, intermediate and rich fen plant communities (Scirpo-Myricion Wells 1981). Distribution maps are presented for releves in each of the 10 associations. Based on species distributions, floristic regions are defined for peatlands in Atlantic Canada. Nutritional characteristics are also described for each plant association. pH and total soil concentrations of calcium, nitrogen and iron proved reliable in separating bog from fen. A boundary between ombrotrophic peatlands and minerotrophic peatlands is suggested, based on a soil pH of 4.0, total soil concentrations of 3.0 mg g(-1) Ca, 4.0 mg g(-1) Fe, 13.0 mg g(-1) N and a Ca/Mg ratio of 2.5. Comparisons between the syntaxa for peatlands in Atlantic Canada and those in Europe are discussed for higher taxa. The possibility of establishing a new order (Chamaedaphno-Scirpetalia Wells ord. nov.) for peatlands in Atlantic Canada is also discussed.

AB Drainage and peat harvesting may induce considerable changes in the fluxes to the atmosphere of the greenhouse gases CH4 and CO2 in peatlands. In this study, fluxes of CH4 and CO2 were measured with the closed chamber method in 6 Swedish peatlands that are being mined. Fluxes of CH4 were much higher from ditches than from mining "strips", i.e. emissions from ditches dominated in most peatlands. The total CH4 emission during the growing season (0.41 to 4.5 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)) was similar to emissions from virgin peatlands. Emissions from ditches can probably be kept low by keeping the ditches clear from vegetation. Like CH4, CO2 was released to the atmosphere from both ditches and strips in most peatlands. The total emission during the growing season (0.23 to 1.0 kg CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)) was strongly dominated by the strips. Compared to the total peat yield during mining these CO2 emission rates imply that on average ca 6% of the peat carbon is lost by microbial decomposition in the mire.

AB This paper studies mire initiation modalities from the Late-Glacial to the Holocene by comparing radiocarbon ages on basal peat layers (112 sites from the Eastern French Massif Central - EFMC) with long-term land cover changes. We developed a semi-quantitative method based on the degree of openness and on Anthropogenic Impact Factors (AIF scores) from palaeoecological data (mire and lake records). Archaeological information was also considered to evaluate human impact. We compared regional mire development trends with datasets from Northern Europe, Siberia, Alaska and Canada, and with global CH4 emission. Heterogenous cases of mire initiation were highlighted during the last 15 ka years in the EMFC. From 15 to 11.7 ka cal. BP, some mires and histic horizons occurred, although further research is needed to better understand these peat accumulation phases. Related to the Early Holocene warming, a mire generation established by terrestrialization, in the southern EFMC where geomorphology favoured fens. Bogs also formed by paludification in the whole area between 10 and 7 ka cal. BP. Then, various cases of mire initiation were found from 4.4 to 2.4 ka cal. BP. The high number of mires established since 2.4 ka cal. BP could be related to major anthropogenic changes, indirectly favouring fens (in former ponds for instance) or small bogs (at the back of roads, walls or in abandoned drainage systems). This last generation was typical of Western European mountains and implied that moderate human impact may also produce socio-ecosystems with high ecological value. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

SO APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE

DT Article
DE Climate change; Nutrient limitation; P-availability; Rich fen; Summer
   drought
AB . Phosphorus availability in low P-soils is primarily controlled by soil processes that are subject to seasonal fluctuation. There is evidence that summer drought causing low fen-water levels induces temporal high P-availability. We investigate here whether and how fen vegetation responds to P-pulses at different times in the season. Plots were fertilized with equal P-doses at three different times in the season. Four conclusions can be drawn from the experiment: 1. The vegetation is able to increase P-uptake independent of the timing of fertilizer application; 2. Early-season fertilization stimulates growth and increases P-concentration in above-ground tissue while late-season fertilization does not stimulate growth but strongly increases above-ground tissue concentration; 3. Timing effects cause differential species responses: the response of Carex demissa, a stress-tolerant species, is truly independent of timing, while Juncus articulatus, a CSR-type species (sensu Grime) profits more from early-season fertilization; 4. Timing effects persist over several years. The differences between the experimental treatment and the events it aimed to simulate are discussed. We expect that higher frequencies of drought events, that may be induced by climate change, will cause a shift from nutrient-stress tolerant towards stress-tolerant-competitor fen species.

AB Drainage of peatlands for agriculture causes an increase of CO2 flux from peat decomposition, contributing to national CO2 emission. The reverse process, i.e. for re-creation of wetlands, reduces the CO2 flux, but increases the CH4 flux. We developed a process model (PEATLAND) to simulate these fluxes from peat soils subject to different water-table management scenarios. The model combines primary production, aerobic decomposition of soil organic matter (including the soil-parent material, peat), CH4 formation, oxidation, and transport. Model input requires specification of water table and air temperature data sets, vegetation parameters such as primary production and parameters related to gas transport, and basic soil physical data. Validation using closed flux-chamber measurements Of CO2 and CH4 from five different sites in the western Netherlands shows that seasonal changes in fluxes Of CO2 and CH4 are correctly modelled. However, the CO2 submodel underestimates peat decomposition when peat decomposition rates obtained from laboratory incubation experiments are used as input. Field decomposition rates are considerably higher. This is attributed to enhancement of decomposition by the addition of easily decomposable material from root exudation ('priming effect'). Model experiments indicate that 1) drainage increases the CO2 production from peat decomposition strongly; 2) restoring a high water table may decrease the total greenhouse gas flux by a small amount although the CH4 flux increases strongly; 3) a warmer climate may cause higher greenhouse gas fluxes from peat soils resulting in a positive feedback to climate warming, and 4) high vegetation productivity in fen meadows may stimulate peat decomposition by the priming effect.

AB The effect of humification on the content and composition of the lipids in Sphagnum, Carex, Bryales and Carex-Bryales peats has been studied by capillary GC and GC-MS. The content of lipidic matter and those of its principal parts, i.e. lipid monomers (30-50% of total lipids), non-volatile matter (30-50%) and other volatiles (10-20%) mainly increased with increasing humification in all peat types. The extract content increased in the order Bryales, Carex-Bryales < Sphagnum < Carex, ranging from the average 4-5% on dry weight basis in Bryales and Carex-Bryales peats up to 11% in highly humified Carex peat. Fatty and omega-hydroxy acids comprised 65-90% of the lipid monomer fraction; normal 1-alkanols and sterols together comprised up to 25%. Sphagnum peat was rich in sterols, Carex peat contained high amounts of fatty and omega-hydroxy acids, and Bryales peat showed a comprehensive 1-alkanol content. In Carex-Bryales peat the characteristics of both Bryales and Carex peats were found. Peat lipids originate in mosses and higher plants. Under oxygen-poor or anaerobic conditions they are, however, subjected to microbial changes, e.g. to hydrogenation and degradation, as reflected by the stanol/stenol ratios and changes to the CPI values of n-alkanes. The one-carbon loss in the degradation of n-alkanoic acids was also found to occur under aerobic conditions in the low-decomposed Sphagnum peat samples. The long-chain omega-hydroxyalkanoic acids with other longer-chain (greater-than-or-equal-to C22) lipid monomers accumulate in polymerized lipids, resulting in increased decay resistance of the various peat-forming plants. Polymerized polyhydroxyalkanoic (9,16- and 10,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic and 9,10,18-trihydroxyoctadecanoic) acids are thought to be responsible for the especially high decay resistance of Sphagnum mosses. It also seems likely that the primary reaction type changes from degradation to polymerization at the low-decomposed (H3-H4 on the von Post scale) stage of peat.

AB (1) Andromeda polifolia (bog rosemary) is a common plant species in northern circumboreal peatlands. While not a major peat-forming species in most peatlands, it is characterised by a substantial woody below-ground biomass component that contributes directly to the accumulation of organic matter below the moss surface, as well as sclerophyllous leaf litter that contributes to the accumulation of organic matter above the moss surface. Rather little is known about the fungal communities associated with this plant species. Hence, we investigated the fungal consortium of A. polifolia in three distinct vegetation communities of ombrotrophic bogs near Khanty-Mansiysk, West Siberia, Russia, in 2012 and 2013. These vegetation communities were forested bog (Tr = treed), Sphagnum-dominated lawn (Ln), and Eriophorum-Sphagnum-dominated hummock (Er).
   (2) In total, 37 fungal taxa, belonging to five classes and 16 families, were identified and described morphologically. Seven fungal species were previously known from Andromeda as host. Others are reported for the first time, thus considerably expanding the fungal consortium of this dwarf shrub. Most taxa were saprobic on fallen leaves of A. polifolia found amongst Sphagnum in the bog. Two taxa were parasitic on living plant tissues and one taxon was saprobic on dead twigs. Three taxa, recorded only on A. polifolia leaves and on no other plant species or materials, may be host-specific to this dwarf shrub.
   (3) A quantitative analysis of the frequency of occurrence of all taxa showed that one taxon (Coccomyces duplicarioides) was very abundant, 64 % of the taxa occurred frequently, and 32 % of the taxa occurred infrequently. The mean Shannon diversity index of the community was 2.4.
   (4) There were no statistical differences in the fungal community composition of A. polifolia in the three vegetation communities investigated in this study. Redundancy analysis suggested that some fungal taxa were positively, and others negatively, correlated with the water level relative to the moss surface in the bog.
   (5) The information about the composition and structure of the fungal consortium of A. polifolia reported here could be supplemented using other techniques such as cultural and molecular methods. Nevertheless, the data presented improve our understanding of the different microbial communities functioning in peatlands and, thus, of carbon dynamics in these ecosystems.

AB In this study we present the plant communities, their abiotic site conditions and the main environmental gradients underlying variation in species composition of mire sites in three montane mires in the Northern Limestone Alps. For the phytosociological description of the mires we sampled species composition in 115 releves. In order to characterize the site conditions of the most important plant communities we measured humification as well as water table depth, pH and electrical conductivity at 46 sites during a large part of the growing season. The main environmental gradients were identified by fitting environmental vectors and smoothed surfaces onto NMDS ordination. The most frequent communities on subneutral and neutral sites were the Caricetum davallianae, the Amblystegio stellati-Caricetum dioicae and the Schoenetum ferruginei, whereas acidic sites were mainly covered by the Eriophoro-Trichophoretum cespitosi. The most important factor for floristic variation between sites was pH. However, within bogs and fens, variation in species composition was mainly due to differences in water table depth.

AB Peatlands are an important potential sink or source of carbon and play a significant role in climate change regulation. Understanding peatland as 3D-landforms is as important as mapping their spatial extent. The main aim of this work was to estimate a 3D representation of peat properties and assess the associated spatial uncertainty, to provide baseline information for climate and land use change analyses. In this study a combination of 3D Generalized Additive Models and 3D geostatistics was applied to a raised basin bog using legacy data to map carbon content. The study presents a novel approach based on methods providing quantification of the spatial uncertainty and the possibility to model complex relationships. The approach fully exploits the 3D spatial relationships between the survey points while supported by environmental variables. The methods proved to be general and highly flexible.
   The results of this study showed that it is possible to model peat properties to obtain a detailed volumetric assessment of the peat, including carbon stocks from a limited set of legacy data. The estimates of spatial uncertainty are important when including the results in further environmental and climate-change models or for decision making to provide alternatives and prioritisation.

AB 1. Detailed floristic records from 12 mires on three Suffolk fens were gathered in 1959 and 1991. The data were analysed using tabulation and ordination to elucidate change at the plant community and individual species levels.
   2. Substantial changes at both levels were observed. The respective roles of three factors, namely lack of traditional management, changes in water regime and increased fertility, in accounting for these changes, have been explored.
   3. At community level, those mires which showed the greatest alteration were those subject to hydrological disturbance combined with dereliction. In terms of the British National Vegetation Classification they changed from short sedge mires allied to M13 Schoeno-Juncetum towards highly fertile tall herb fens with many ruderals and allied to S26 Phragmites australis-Urtica dioica fen. Partial dewatering led to M27 Filipendula ulmaria-Angelica sylvestris tall herb fen with few non-fen ruderals.
   4. Mires where ground water influx was reduced or eliminated but where traditional management was sustained showed less community change, with more of the principle community dominants being maintained. Here M13 Scheono-Juncetum mires developed into dry variants of M24 Molinia caerulea-Cirsium dissectum fen meadows,
   5. Mires with undisturbed hydrology but which became derelict were transformed from M13 Schoeno-Juncetum into hydrophytic Cladium-dominated communities of the S25 Phragmites australis-Eupatorium cannabinum tall herb fens. Many fen species were retained or recruited, while the colonization of ruderals, scrub and non-fen species that was noted in the dewatered mires did not occur.
   6. The dewatered mires showed the greatest alteration at species level. In unmanaged areas, all of the fen associates and bryophytes were lost and replaced by non-fen species and ruderal tall herbs. Where traditional management was maintained, most of the small species characteristic of wet fens and semi-aquatic conditions were still lost, although recruitment of ruderals and non-fen plants was less evident, being restricted to species of mesotrophic meadows. Retained species tended to be common fen plants or non-fen species.
   7. Mires which were derelict, but where the natural hydrology persisted, showed the least change in associated flora. Nevertheless, many of the smaller herbs were still eliminated by competition in the now dense tall-herb fen, indicating that traditional management was required as well as hydrological integrity for the survival of most wet-fen species. However, some wet-fen species were retained or recruited, indicating management to be subordinate to hydrology in their maintenance. They include Caltha palustris, Valeriana dioica, Lotus uliginosus and the bryophytes Campylium stellatum, Aneura pinguis, Sphagnum subnitens and Riccardia multifida.
   8. All mires showed a decline in conservation importance as measured by indices of botanical 'quality'. The mires which showed least decline (15-64% reduction in Rarity Weighted Principal Fen Species Score) were those which retained their hydrological integrity, regardless of management status. One mire, only partially dewatered but still managed, declined by nearly 70%.
   9. Although there were problems with the data, tentative comments are made on the relative importance of the three environmental factors to the maintenance of mire systems. It is concluded that maintenance of stable hydrologies is more important than extensive management in the long-term conservation of these sites.

AB High latitude peatlands act as globally important carbon (C) sinks and are in constant interaction with the atmosphere. Their C storage formed during the Holocene. In the course of time, the aggregate effect of the C fluxes on radiative forcing (RF) typically changes from warming to cooling, but the timing of this shift varies among different peatlands. Here we investigated Holocene peatland development, including vegetation history, vertical peat growth and the lateral expansion of a patterned subarctic fen in northern Finland by means of multiple sampling points. We modelled the Holocene RF by combining knowledge on past vegetation communities based on plant macrofossil stratigraphies and present in situ C flux measurements. The peatland initiated at ca. 9500 calibrated years Before Present (cal yr BP), and its lateral expansion was greatest between ca. 9000 and 7000 cal yr BP. After the early expansion, vertical peat growth proceeded very differently in different parts of the peatland, regulated by internal and external factors. The pronounced surface microtopography, with high strings and wet (larks, started to form only after ca. 1000 cal yr BP. C accumulation within the peatland recorded a high degree of spatial variability throughout its history, including the recent past. We applied two flux scenarios with different interpretation of the initial peatland development phases to estimate the RF induced by C fluxes of the fen. After ca. 4000 cal yr BP, at the latest, the peatland RF has been negative (cooling), mainly driven by C uptake and biomass production, while methane emissions had a lesser role in the total RF. Interestingly, these scenarios suggest that the greatest cooling effect took place around ca. 1000 cal yr BP, after which the surface microtopography established. The study demonstrated that despite the high spatial heterogeneity and idiosyncratic behaviour of the peatland, the RF of the studied fen followed the general development pattern of more southern peatlands. Holocene climate variations and warm phases did not seem to induce any distinctive and consistent peatland-scale patterns in C accumulation, whereas our data suggests that the changes in vegetation related to autogenic succession were reflected in the C accumulation patterns and RF more clearly.

AB The Cenozoic Krabi Basin in the southern part of peninsular Thailand contains about 112 million tons proven coal reserves. At present, coal is only produced from the Bang Mark mine located in the southern part of the basin, where the main lignite bed is 7-20 m thick. The lignite bed occurs in an overall paralic succession. The present paper investigates the depositional conditions of an approximately 8 m thick lignite bed (main seam) in the Bang Mark mine using organic petrography, including maceral ratios, and geochemistry. The results are further interpreted in a sequence stratigraphic context. The lignite is of low rank and is completely dominated by huminite indicating generally oxygen-deficient conditions in the precursor mire. Very low inertinite contents suggest rare occurrences of wildfires. The lower part of the lignite bed represents a topogenous fresh water peat mire with open water areas that in few cases may have experienced influx of saline water. The peat mire was subjected to periodic inundations and deposition of siliciclastics. Tissue preservation was relatively poor. The upper part of the lignite bed represents a slightly domed fresh water ombrogenous peat mire with a stable watertable and a balance between peat accumulation and accommodation space creation that favoured preservation of plant tissues. In general, the mire vegetation changed from less woody in the topogenous mire to more arborescent in the ombrogenous mire, where plants with suberinised wood cell walls also were more frequent. Decompacted, the lignite bed corresponds to a minimum similar to 11 m thick peat deposit that records from similar to 22,000 to 55,000 years of peat accumulation. Watertable rise in the peat mire was controlled overall by relative sea-level rise. In a sequence stratigraphic context, the lignite bed overlies a terrestrialisation surface (TeS; sensu Diessel, 2007) and the lowermost part records peat formation during a falling watertable and a decreasing accommodation/peat accumulation ratio (terrestrialisation). An accommodation reversal surface (ARS; sensu Diessel, 2007) indicates a change to paludification style of peat formation characterised by rising watertable and a high accommodation/peat accumulation ratio. Another ARS marks a gradual change to a situation with a balanced accommodation/peat accumulation ratio. The overall watertable rise throughout peat formation, but at a gradually slower rate from base to top, suggests that the lignite bed could be located in the late transgressive systems tract (TST).

AB Megascopic, micropetrographic and scanning-electron microscopic investigations of fibrous coal indicate that paleo-wildfires were common occurrences in the mire which produced Highvale coals. At least 20 fibrous coal (fusain) horizons have been identified in corehole samples from the pit no. 3 locality at Highvale, in the central Alberta Plains. Thicknesses of individual horizons vary, and are not particular to any stratigraphic position within coal seams. The majority of these fibrous horizons is within the two thick economic seams, the Highvale Nos, 1 and 2, which are characteristically megascopically dull. The dullness of given lithotypes is largely related to inertinite content with fibrous coal containing 51% inertinite on average, and selected horizons comprised of as much as 85% inertinite. Semifusinite and inertodetrinite are the predominant inertinites, with a few horizons exhibiting highly reflecting fusinite. Macrinite is rare, and micrinite is absent. SEM investigations reveal that certain fibrous coals exhibit excellent preservation of the original gymnospermous (Taxodium) woody tissue. Features such as homogenization and swelling of the cell walls, elimination of the middle lamellae, and preservation of bordered pits are clearly indicative of charcoal formation as a product of paleo-wildfires. Depending upon the nature of the fire, temperatures obtained and the nature of the mire vegetation, a wide range of inertinite precursors can be produced.

AB 1 As peatlands form they create a temporal archive of community development, allowing the reconstruction of vegetation dynamics through the analysis of sediments and the development of detailed chronologies of successional change. Peatland formation occurs through two mechanisms: (i) terrestrialization, when a water body fills with sediments and peat; and (ii) paludification, the conversion of dry land to peatland. In temperate regions, where high summer temperatures may limit peat accumulation, general models of peatland development suggest that allogenic factors such as climate change control peatland development and that terrestrialization is the primary mechanism of formation.
   2 This study evaluates this widely accepted model by comparing the developmental histories of three peatlands within the same climate region in New England in order to: (i) describe the development and timing of successional events among peatlands; (ii) document the roles of paludification and terrestrialization as developmental mechanisms; and (iii) evaluate the importance of climate change vs. autogenic factors in peatland development in this temperate region.
   3 Basin morphometry, sediment stratigraphies, and chronologies of community change determined through radiocarbon dating indicate that peatland development at each site involved terrestrialization followed by paludification, with no apparent influence of broad-scale climate change on the timing of these processes. Paludification was consistently initiated coincident with the consolidation of a shrub mat across each lake-basin, and was controlled in extent and rate by the topography of the adjoining uplands. The timing of stratigraphic changes varied among sites, suggesting that autogenic factors associated with the accumulation of peat rather than regional climate change controlled development. These results provide the foundation for a model of temperate peatland development driven by autogenic factors and caution against the use of temperate peatland development as a proxy for climatic reconstruction.

ID VEGETATION; SUCCESSION; GRASSLAND; PLANTS; IMPACT
AB Campylopus introflexus is an invasive alien moss in Europe and North America considered as a threat to biodiversity, especially in dune habitats. In this study, we found that C. introflexus is a common pioneer species in vacuumharvested peatlands in Latvia occurring on dry peat substrates and peat substrates with highly fluctuating water tables, but not on waterlogged peat surfaces. The spread of this species is limited by dense vegetation cover, shading and high water table, but it is tolerant of different peat substrate properties and a wide range of pH values. The invaded plant communities do not represent a species composition typical of natural bogs and fens. C. introflexus can be considered as a successful pioneer invader on cutaway peatlands with minor impacts on vegetation diversity or particular native species and cannot be considered as a threat to peatlands. In cutaway peatlands, the vegetation recovery toward formation of bog or fen communities is hindered by lowered water table, not by invasion of C. introflexus.

AB Post-mine landscape reclamation of the Athabasca Oil Sands Region requires the use of tailings sand, an abundant mine-waste material that often contains large amounts of sodium (Na). Due to the mobility of Na in groundwater and its effects on vegetation, water quality is a concern when incorporating mine waste materials, especially when attempting to construct groundwater-fed peatlands. This research is the first published account of Na redistribution in groundwater from a constructed tailings sand upland to an adjacent constructed fen peat deposit (Nikanotee Fen). A permeable petroleum coke layer underlying the fen, extending partway into the upland, was important in directing flow and Na beneath the peat, as designed. Initially, Na+ concentration was highest in the tailings sand (average of 232 mg L-1) and lowest in fen peat (96 mg L-1). Precipitation-driven recharge to the upland controlled the mass flux of Na from upland to fen, which ranged from 2 to 13 tons Na per year. The mass flux was highest in the driest summer, in part from dry-period flowpaths that direct groundwater with higher concentrations of Na into the coke layer, and in part because of the high evapotranspiration loss from the fen in dry periods, which induces upward water flow. With the estimated flux rates of 336 mm yr 1, the Na arrival time to the fen surface was estimated to be between 4 and 11 years. Over the four-year study, average Na concentrations within the fen rooting zone increased from 87 to 200 mg L-1, and in the tailings sand decreased to 196 mg L-1. The planting of more salt-tolerant vegetation in the fen is recommended, given the potential for Na accumulation. This study shows reclamation designs can use layered flow system to control the rate, pattern, and timing of solute interactions with surface soil systems.

DE Grouse moor; Blanket peat; Burning; Sphagnum; Remote sensing
AB Burning of ericaceous vegetation on moorland in the United Kingdom is a routine part of management for red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica) but its contribution to peatland degradation and loss of key ecosystem services is widely debated. Studies in the North Pennines, northern England, have shown that regular fires at approximately ten-year intervals can benefit Sphagnum mosses and cotton grass (Eriophorum) cover at the expense of ling heather (Calluna vulgaris). We repeated an assessment from a Pennine study of post-burning vegetation succession at a moor in south-west Scotland also managed for grouse. Here, GPS-mapped fires from 2009 to 14 were visited in 2019 to measure the vegetation response and compare it with unburned control plots. Heather cover, vegetation height and biomass increased linearly over time since burning, whereas cotton grass decreased during the first eight years. Sphagnum cover in plots burnt eight to ten years earlier averaged five times higher than that in the no-burn control plots and was positively correlated with peat depth. These results support earlier studies in northern England, showing that prescribed burning at regular intervals can increase Sphagnum cover by reducing heather cover and canopy vegetation biomass. We discuss the repercussions of this for management of blanket peat habitat, including reducing wildfire risk across UK moorlands.

AB Questions: Were continued groundwater discharge and mowing regimes sufficient for vegetation preservation from 1944 to 1993? Which has a stronger effect on vegetation development; groundwater discharge or mowing? What is the role of surface water eutrophication as driver of vegetation change?
   Location: Het Hol, The Netherlands (ca. 92 ha, 52 degrees 13' N, 5 degrees 05' E).
   Methods: Hydrology was simulated for the late 1940s, early 1960s and 1987. Vegetation maps (1944, 1960, 1975 and 1993) were compared for biotope cover. Vegetation recordings in 1944 and 1987 were compared. Surface water quality was compared between 1950 and 1987. Which sites were mown was reconstructed from an interview. Effects of periodic mowing and groundwater discharge on vegetation development were tested for correlation.
   Results: Biotope diversity reduced significantly through decrease of semi-aquatic and tall-herb biotopes, and expansion of forest. The quagfen terrestrialization sere nearly disappeared from 1987 recordings, while the reed sere did well concerning abundance and species richness. Several typical (rich) fen species disappeared from recordings, while new species were mostly field margin species. Periodic mowing and discharge combined are correlated with increasing species numbers. The P-concentration in surface water increased while N-concentration decreased.
   Conclusions: Preservation of the reed sere was successful, whereas preservation of the quagfen sere was not. Periodic mowing and discharge stimulate species richness, discharge more so than periodic mowing. But slight eutrophication likely induced a shift from P-limitation to N-limitation, which stimulated the reed sere at the expense of the quagfen sere.

AB The survival and establishment of tree seedlings represents a critical step in the process of forest stand regeneration. In this study, we evaluated the effect of peat mining and vegetation scarification (removal of understorey vegetation and peat moss layer up to depth of 15 cm) on seedling survival and establishment of two congenerous tree species, R rotundata and R sylvestris, under different moisture and light conditions. Two long-term experiments with planted and sown seedlings were conducted on three peat bogs in the Bohemian Forest and the Trebon Basin (Czech Republic). Significant differences in seedling survival and establishment for both pine species were found. The positive effect of lower groundwater level and shading was the best predictor for survival and establishment of planted seedlings of both pine species in a mined peat bog, especially for R rotundata. Nevertheless, low groundwater level and vegetation scarification had negative effect on R rotundata seedling survival and establishment in pristine peat bogs. P rotundata seems to be more adaptable to newly appearing conditions in both environments of abandoned mined peat bog and of vegetation scarification. Our results suggest that it is more reasonable to use seedlings of R rotundata than seedlings of P sylvestris to restore mined peat bogs.

AB Rich fens (minerotrophic peatlands with surface water pH > 5-5) have greater alkalinity and species richness than other boreal peatlands. We used short-term laboratory incubations to quantify CO2 and CH4 production in peat from five extreme-rich fens in Alberta. Carbon dioxide production rates averaged 48.29 +/- 1.36 mu mol CO2 g organic matter(-1) d(-1) across sites and sampling events. Peat from all sites produced CH4 during anaerobic incubations, leading to average anaerobic CH4 production rates of 359.53 +/- 138.7 nmol CH4 g organic matter(-1) d(-1). However, methane frequently was consumed (oxidized) during aerobic incubations, leading to aerobic CH4 consumption rates averaging 75.2 +/- 63.7 nmol CH4 g organic matter(-1) d(-1) across sites. Calculated rates of dissolved H2CO3 + HCO3- production averaged 59.7 +/- 13.4 mu mol g organic matter(-1) d(-1), suggesting that dissolved inorganic C is important to the overall C fluxes in these rich fens. Our results suggest that changing hydrologic conditions will influence the balance between methanogenesis and methanotrophy in rich fens, but that surface water chemistry, likely influenced by marl precipitation, also is important to decomposition. Rich fens are estimated to represent the most common wetland type in Alberta, and these peatland ecosystems could play an important role in trace gas emissions across boreal regions.

AB It is not well understood how the ecological status and microbial community composition of spruce swamp forests (SSF) relate to those found in bogs and fens. To clarify this, we investigated biogeochemical parameters and microbial community composition in a bog, a fen and two SSF using high throughput barcoded sequencing of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) variable region V4. The results demonstrated that the microbial community of SSF is positioned between those of bogs and fens, and this was confirmed by in silico predicted metabolic potentials. This corresponds well with the position of SSF on the trophic gradient and reflects distinct responses of microbial communities to environmental variables. Species richness and microbial diversity increased significantly from bog to fen, with SSF in between, reflecting the variation in pH, nutrient availability and peat decomposability. The archaeal community, dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens, was more similar in SSF and the bog compared with the fen. The composition of the bacterial community of SSF was intermediate between those of bog and fen. However, the production of CO2 (an indicator of peat decomposability) did not differ between SSF and bog, suggesting the limiting effect of low pH and poor litter quality on the functioning of the bacterial community in SSF. These results help to clarify the transitional position of SSF between bogs and fens and showed the strong effect of environmental conditions on microbial community composition and functioning.

AB Fen-bog succession is accompanied by strong increases of carbon accumulation rates. We tested the prevailing hypothesis that living Sphagna have extraordinarily high cation exchange capacity (CEC) and therefore acidify their environment by exchanging tissue-bound protons for basic cations in soil water. As Sphagnum invasion in a peatland usually coincides with succession from a brown moss-dominated alkaline fen to an acidic bog, the CEC of Sphagna is widely believed to play an important role in this acidification process. However, Sphagnum CEC has never been compared explicitly to that of a wide range of other bryophyte taxa. Whether high CEC directly leads to the ability to acidify the environment in situ also remains to be tested.
   We screened 20 predominant subarctic bryophyte species, including fen brown mosses and bog Sphagna for CEC, in situ soil water acidification capacity (AC), and peat acid neutralizing capacity (ANC). All these bryophyte species possessed substantial CEC, which was remarkably similar for brown mosses and Sphagna. This refutes the commonly accepted idea of living Sphagnum CEC being responsible for peatland acidification, as Sphagnum's ecological predecessors, brown mosses, can do the same job. Sphagnum AC was several times higher than that of other bryophytes, suggesting that CE (cation exchange) sites of Sphagna in situ are not saturated with basic cations, probably due to the virtual absence of these cations in the bog water. Together, these results suggest that Sphagna can not realize their CEC in bogs, while fen mosses can do so in fens. The fen peat ANC was 65% higher than bog ANC, indicating that acidity released by brown mosses in the CE process was neutralized, maintaining an alkaline environment.
   We propose two successional pathways indicating boundaries for a fen-bog shift with respect to bryophyte CEC. In neither of them is Sphagnum CE an important factor. We conclude that living Sphagnum CEC does not play any considerable role in the fen-bog shift. Alternatively, we propose that exclusively indirect effects of Sphagnum expansion such as peat accumulation and subsequent blocking of upward alkaline soil water transport are keys to the fen-bog succession and therefore for bog-associated carbon accumulation.

AB Spatial surface patterns of hummocks, hollows, ridges, and pools (microtopography) are common features of many northern peatlands and are particularly distinct within the vast peatlands of the Hudson Bay Lowland (HBL), Canada. Hypotheses and models describe how small-scale feedbacks among vegetation, hydrology, and nutrients cause spatial differences in peat accumulation that enable microforms and surface patterns to develop over time. Empirical tests of the predictions from theoretical models of these proposed feedback mechanisms are limited, particularly in large peatland complexes such as the HBL. We investigate feedbacks controlling peatland structure and function in an ombrogenous bog and a minerogenous fen in the HBL. Our sites represent surface patterns found in many northern peatlands, specifically spatially irregular hummocks and hollows, and parallel ridges and pools that are perpendicular to slope. We found the occurrence of different spatial patterns depends on position within a peat landform, with these differences attributed to the ecohydrological setting. In turn, the ecohydrological setting, with different water table depths, nutrient availability, and species composition, influences the strength and direction of feedback mechanisms at the microform scale. Our data support the prediction of a positive feedback between plant productivity and acrotelm thickness for peat accumulation and hummock growth and that this may be enhanced by water ponding on slopes to form ridge-pool tracks. We did not find evidence to support the proposed feedback among evapotranspiration-driven transport of water and nutrients for the development of hummocks. Our results suggest a combination of mechanisms operating at various temporal and spatial scales is associated with the development of surface patterns in northern peatlands.

AB Peatlands are characteristic features of the Fennoscandian landscape, about one-quarter of the land surface being classified as peatland. The aim of this work was to determine the extent to which the distribution of four main mire complex types (aapa mire, blanket bog, palsa mire, raised bog) can be modelled on the basis of climatological parameters. Additionally, the relative importance of different climatological variables in influencing the distribution of different mire complex types was scrutinized using the variation partitioning method. Variation partitioning is a novel statistical approach that provides deeper understanding of the importance of different explanatory variable groups for geographical patterns than traditional regression methods. The variation in the distribution of mire complex types was decomposed into independent and joint effects of temperature, precipitation and spatial variables.
   The distributional limits of aapa mires, palsa mires and raised bogs were primarily associated with thermal factors, whereas moisture regime also played an obvious role for blanket bogs. A considerable amount of variation in the distribution of mire complex types was accounted for by the joint effects of explanatory variables and may thus be causally related to two or all three groups of variables. Although the present distribution of mire complex types corresponded well to the contemporary climate in Fennoscandia, our results indicate that the climate envelopes of palsa mires are narrow. Thus, they can be expected to be extremely sensitive to changes in future climatic conditions.

AB The temperate peatlands are extensive, covering around 3.5 million km(2) of land. They contain about 455 Gt of carbon, almost equivalent to the carbon stored in all of the living things on the surface of the planet, and representing around 25% of all the soil carbon on earth. These bogs are a sink for atmospheric carbon and their carbon uptake accounts for about 12% of current human emissions. They vary considerably in their form and structure and are an important resource for scientific research, including the study of past environments and climate change, and they are also valuable in environmental education. They are low in biodiversity, but their fauna and flora are distinctive and many groups are confined to this habitat. For all these reasons, the future conservation of peatlands is a matter for concern. Threats to peatlands come from direct human exploitation in the form of peat harvesting for energy and horticulture, and drainage for forestry. Rising environmental awareness should control both of these processes in the western world, but continued northern peatland losses are likely locally, especially in Asia. Peatland drainage for forestry or agriculture will result in losses of carbon to the atmosphere, adding to the greenhouse effect. Human population pressures, industrialization and urbanization are unlikely to have an important direct and immediate influence in the boreal zone. Fragmentation of the habitat is not an important consideration because bogs are by their very nature 'island' habitats. Acidification by aerial pollution may be a local problem close to sources, but the habitat is naturally acid and should not be severely affected, The input of aerial nutrients, however, particularly nitrogen, could have widespread impact on bogs, enhancing their productivity and altering their vegetation composition. The physical rehabilitation of bogs damaged by human activities presents many problems, particularly relating to the re-establishment of peat structure and vegetation, but the process can result in the re-formation of a carbon sink so it is worth the effort. Climate change is the most important consideration in its impact on bogs. Higher temperature (especially if accompanied by raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and increased nitrate deposition) will enhance productivity, but will also result in faster decomposition rates. The outcome of these opposing factors for peat formation will ultimately depend on the future pattern of precipitation. If, as seems most likely, summer conditions become warmer and drier in continental regions and winters become milder and wetter, the summer drought could cause peat loss and bog contraction. An excess of decomposition will lead to bogs becoming a carbon source and thus a positive feedback in global warming. Emissions of methane and nitrous oxide would add to the greenhouse gas problem, but likely oxidation of methane and low N(2)O production may well mean that this impact will not prove to be significant. Tree invasion of bogs as a consequence of summer drought could locally lead to increased water loss through transpiration, and higher heat absorption through albedo change. This will enhance the drying effect on the bog surface. Oceanic mires will be less severely affected if the expected increase in precipitation takes place in these regions. The most important overall factor in determining the future of the northern bogs is likely to be the quantity and pattern (both spatially and temporally) of future precipitation in the zone.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions from managed peatlands are annually reported to the UNFCCC For the estimation of greenhouse gas (GHG) balances on a country-wide basis, It is necessary to know how soil-atmosphere fluxes are associated with variables that are available for spatial upscaling We measured momentary soil-atmosphere CO2 (heterotrophic and total soil respiration), CH4 and N2O fluxes at 68 forestry-drained peatland sites in Finland over two growing seasons We estimated annual CO2 effluxes for the sites using site-specific temperature regressions and simulations in half-hourly time steps Annual CH4 and N2O fluxes were interpolated from the measurements We then tested how well climate and site variables derived from forest inventory results and weather statistics could be used to explain between-site variation in the annual fluxes The estimated annual CO2 effluxes ranged from 1165 to 4437 g m(-2) year(-1) (total soil respiration) and from 534 to 2455 g m(-2) year(-1) (heterotrophic soil respiration) Means of 95% confidence intervals were +/- 12% of total and +/- 22% of heterotrophic soil respiration Estimated annual CO2 efflux was strongly correlated with soil respiration at the reference temperature (10 degrees C) and with summer mean air temperature. Temperature sensitivity had little effect on the estimated annual fluxes Models with tree stand stem volume, site type and summer mean air temperature as independent variables explained 56% of total and 57% of heterotrophic annual CO2 effluxes. Adding summer mean water table depth to the models raised the explanatory power to 66% and 64% respectively Most of the sites were small CH4 sinks and N2O sources The interpolated annual CH4 flux (range -0 97 to 12 50 g m(-2) year(-1)) was best explained by summer mean water table depth (r(2) = 64%) and rather weakly by tree stand stern volume (r(2) = 22%) and mire vegetation cover (r(2) = 15%) N2O flux (range. -0 03 to 092 g m(-2) year(-1)) was best explained by peat CN ratio (r(2) = 35%). Site type explained 13% of annual N2O flux We suggest that water table depth should be measured in national land-use inventories for improving the estimation of country-level GHG fluxes for peatlands (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB Juncus castaneus and J. triglumis are umbrella species of moist calcareous tundra and arctic-alpine initial fens (the Caricion atrofusco-saxatilis alliance), considered to be glacial relicts in the central-European Mts. Here we report new findings from the Western Carpathians (Slovakia). We analysed species composition of plant communities with the target Juncus species in a wide geographical context, using 20 available vegetation-plot records from the Carpathians, 711 records from other European regions, and formal definitions of fen alliances taken from a pan-European vegetation synthesis. The first gradient of non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) differentiated alpine and arctic samples. The second principal gradient between Caricion atrofusco-saxatilis and other vegetation types was of similar importance. Records from the Western Carpathians assumed a marginal position in the gradient space, while records from the Eastern Carpathians (Romania) appeared to be similar to those from the Alps. Generally, Carpathian records did not match the formal definition of the Caricion atrofusco-saxatilis alliance. Although the arctic-alpine rush species persist occasionally in spring, fen and tundra microrefugia in the Carpathians, they do not belong in similar plant communities as in the Alps or in the Arctic.

   AVAILABILITY; NUTRIENT ADDITION
AB Biomass production, length of current-season shoots, number of new shoots produced per plant, reproductive effort, and tissue-nutrient concentrations of the ericaceous evergreen Chamaedaphne calyculata (leatherleaf) were determined at two acidic peatland sites. Measurements were made under unfertilized conditions and following the addition of NPK over two consecutive years. The ''shrub'' site, a poor fen, had a deeper aerobic zone during most of the growing season, larger pools of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg within the surface peat (0-30 cm) and the leatherleaf biomass, and greater amounts of extractable P and K within the peat. At the poor fen, taller leatherleaf shrubs had significantly more biomass and longer shoots, and more flowers and fruits were produced. At the ''open'' site, a bog, leatherleaf plants doubled biomass productivity, shoot length, and allocation to reproductive structures, and increased the concentration of N, P, and K in current shoots in response to the addition of NPK. In contrast, leatherleaf at the poor fen site responded to the addition of NPK by only increasing the concentration of N, P, and K in the current shoots. These results suggest that the growth of leatherleaf may be limited by the availability of N, P, and/or K in bogs but not in poor fens.

AB Beaver activity is often considered a hydrologic disturbance that "resets" succession. We determined how beaver impoundment and wetland size and water chemistry affected the vegetation and succession of 25 beaver meadows and ponds using the space-for-time substitution. We used aerial photography to investigate whether a large 1947 fire in one region of Mount Desert Island, Maine, led to differences in regional temporal fluctuations in beaver pond occupancy over 60 y and determined whether these fluctuations led to different regional distributions of beaver wetland plant community types. Cluster analysis segregated 4 wetland groups: sedge meadows, sedge fens, shrub fens, and forested fens, which segregated along gradients of time since dam collapse, water chemistry, and wetland size. Beaver did not affect water chemistry or wetland size. Pond vegetation was a function of community type prior to flooding, water chemistry, and geomorphic setting. The successional model consisted of 2 separate cycles, corresponding to differences in pH and peat accumulations. Beaver pond creation rates differed in burned and unburned regions over time. Due to increased activity in the burned region, there was a different distribution of plant communities between the regions. Wetlands abandoned at the peak of beaver pond creation in 1979 were flooded for shorter durations, resulting in forested fen vegetation.. Beaver activity created different successional cycles within different water chemistry and geomorphic contexts. Water chemistry, wetland size, and initial wetland state, which primarily determined non-forested wetland type, were not influenced by beaver.

AB A field experiment was carried out to validate the results of a previous laboratory experiment showing that part of the carbon released from decaying Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needle and fine root litter was retained in the peat soil. C-14-labelled litter was incubated for up to 1.5 years in pristine and drained pear soils. During this period, 40-60% of the: initial C-14-activity was lost from the litter and 10-30% of the lost activity was retained in the soil. Needle litter decomposed faster than fine root litter. On average, drainage increased the mass and C-14 losses from the needle litter in Carex-peat but not in Sphagnum-peat. Losses from the fine root litter were not clearly affected by drainage. Drainage did not significantly affect the relative proportion of C-14-activity found in the peat. The results support the earlier hypothesis that a flow of organic C from decaying tree litter contributes to C storage in drained peatlands. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Methane emissions from sis mires in northern Sweden were measured using a closed chamber technique during the frost free season in 1992. The average methane flux over the measurement period, calculated either for each mire or for different plant communities within one mire, ranged from 9 to 83 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). The emission rate on each occasion was related to physical and chemical environmental variables, both in a general data set for all mires (n=836) and in subdata sets for individual mires, using multiple linear regression. The variables with significant contributions to the models were water table, standing water above the vegetation surface, peat temperatures, and principal components of the near infrared reflectance spectra of peat samples reflecting variations in organic chemical composition. To account for the actual contribution of methane production and methane oxidation, variables describing the active parts of the vertically distributed potentials of methane production or oxidation were constructed. The interaction terms between these variables, respectively, describing the active proportion of methanogens and methanotrophs, and the temperature values representing the anoxic and oxic parts of the profile were significantly correlated to the methane emission rate; positively for the production zone and negatively for the consumption zone. By using this mechanistic approach, a significant temperature effect in both the methane production and consumption zone was detected. These constructed temperature variables explain 21% of the variance in the logarithmically transformed methane fluxes using the entire data set (n=836) but only 5% of the variance using peat temperatures from fixed depths. Adding variables describing the organic chemical composition of the peat to the models improved the predictability in 10 of the 11 model sets tested, decreasing the unexplained variance by maximally 50% for a poor fen community model and increasing R-2 from 0.40 to 0.68. In the general model, R-2 increased from 0.42 to 0.49 with the inclusion of organic chemical composition. The explained variance in the final models, including the substrate variables, ranged from R-2=0.49 to R-2=0.75, with one exception, Torsmyran (R-2=0.36) which is a mire that most closely relates to an eccentric ombrotrophic bog among the mires studied.

AB Drained peatlands are known to be important sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). While CO2 emissions occur mainly during the growing season, large N2O emissions may occur during the non-growing season as well. Peatland re-wetting may be an effective measure to prevent those emissions. However, recent research shows that re-wetted peatlands may release large amounts of methane (CH4) during the years immediately after re-wetting whereas abandonment of intensive grassland on drained peat soils possibly leads to low nutrient supply and thus to small greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here we examine the role of extensification practices (such as abandonment of mineral fertilisation, reduced cutting frequency and a cattle-free winter period) on GHG emissions from a temperate peatland during winter. From November 2009 to March 2010 GHG measurements were made on a minerotrophic fen five years after intensive grassland use was abandoned. During the measurement period CO2 and N2O emissions amounted to 4.4 t ha(-1) and 2.6 t ha(-1) CO2-equivalent, whilst CH4 emissions were negligible. Altogether the site emitted 7 t ha(-1) CO2-equivalent, of which 37 % was N2O, even though the winter 2009/2010 was extraordinarily cold. Thus, extensification of grassland use alone may not be sufficient to reduce GHG emissions from temperate peatlands.

AB Plant communities of Unalaska Island in the eastern Aleutian Islands of western Alaska, and their relationship to environmental variables, were studied using a combined Braun-Blanquet and multivariate approach. Seventy releves represented the range of structural and compositional variation in the matrix of vegetation and landform zonation. Eleven major community types were distinguished within six physiognomic-ecological groups: I. Dry coastal meadows: Honckenya peploides beach meadow, Leymus mollis dune meadow. II. Mesic meadows: Athyrium filix-femina - Aconitum maximum meadow, Athyrium filix-femina - Calamagrostis nutkaensis meadow, Erigeron peregrinus - Thelypteris quelpaertensis meadow. III. Wet snowbed meadow: Carex nigricans snowbed meadow. IV. Heath: Linnaea borealis - Empetrum nigrum heath, Phyllodoce aleutica heath, Vaccinium uliginosum - Thamnolia vermicularis fellfield. V. Mire: Carex pluriflora Plantago macrocarpa mire. VI. Deciduous shrub thicket: Salix barclayi - Athyrium filix-femina thicket. These were interpreted as a complex gradient primarily influenced by soil moisture, elevation, and pH. Phytogeographical and syntaxonomical analysis of the plant communities indicated that the dry coastal meadows, most of the heaths, and the mire vegetation belonged, respectively, to the widespread classes Honckenyo-Elymetea, Loiseleurio-Vaccinietea, and Scheuchzerio-Caricetea, characterized by their circumpolar and widespread species. Amphi-Beringian species were likely diagnostic of amphi-Beringian syntaxa, many of these yet to be described.

AB Background: Peatlands are an important component of Canada's landscape, however there is little information on their national-scale net emissions of carbon dioxide [Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE)] and methane (CH4). This study compiled results for peatland NEE and CH4 emissions from chamber and eddy covariance studies across Canada. The data were summarized by bog, poor fen and rich-intermediate fen categories for the seven major peatland containing terrestrial ecozones (Atlantic Maritime, Mixedwood Plains, Boreal Shield, Boreal Plains, Hudson Plains, Taiga Shield, Taiga Plains) that comprise > 96% of all peatlands nationally. Reports of multiple years of data from a single site were averaged and different microforms (e.g., hummock or hollow) within these peatland types were kept separate. A new peatlands map was created from forest composition and structure information that distinguishes bog from rich and poor fen. National Forest Inventory k-NN forest structure maps, bioclimatic variables (mean diurnal range and seasonality of temperatures) and ground surface slope were used to construct the new map. The Earth Observation for Sustainable Development map of wetlands was used to identify open peatlands with minor tree cover.
   Results: The new map was combined with averages of observed NEE and CH4 emissions to estimate a growing season integrated NEE (+/- SE) at - 108.8 (+/- 41.3) Mt CO2 season(-1) and CH4 emission at 4.1 (+/- 1.5) Mt CH4 season(-1) for the seven ecozones. Converting CH4 to CO2 equivalent (CO2 e; Global Warming Potential of 25 over 100 years) resulted in a total net sink of - 7.0 (+/- 77.6) Mt CO2 e season(-1) for Canada. Boreal Plains peatlands contributed most to the NEE sink due to high CO2 uptake rates and large peatland areas, while Boreal Shield peatlands contributed most to CH4 emissions due to moderate emission rates and large peatland areas. Assuming a winter CO2 emission of 0.9 g CO2 M-2 day(-1) creates an annual CO2 source (24.2 Mt CO2 year(-1) ) and assuming a winter CH4 emission of 7 mg CH4 M-2 day(-1) inflates the total net source to 151.8 Mt CO2 e year(-1).
   Conclusions: This analysis improves upon previous basic, aspatial estimates and discusses the potential sources of the high uncertainty in spatially integrated fluxes, indicating a need for continued monitoring and refined maps of peatland distribution for national carbon and greenhouse gas flux estimation.

AB Over 50% of UK soil carbon is stored in peatland systems and 75% of these peatlands are upland blanket bog. The upland blanket bogs of the UK have suffered severe erosion over the last millennium so that they are widely dissected by gully systems. Gully erosion entails primary removal of particulate carbon from the peatland system but also has secondary effects in that it enhances drainage and lowers water tables, potentially enhancing decomposition of surface peats. This paper exploits recent high resolution mapping of the gully erosion on the Bleaklow Plateau in the southern Pennines and existing data on peat growth rates in the area to assess the impact of gully erosion on peatland carbon balance and the relative importance of primary and secondary impacts of gullying on carbon sequestration. The results indicate that gully erosion during the last millennium has shifted the Bleaklow Plateau from being a net sink of carbon (-20.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) to a net source (29.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The relative importance of gullying impacts can be expressed as follows: particulate organic carbon (POC) flux > change in gully net ecosystem exchange >> loss of gully margin carbon sequestration. The implication of these findings is that the magnitude of the potentially reversible impacts of gully erosion (reduced carbon fixation due to vegetation loss and ongoing erosional loss of POC) far exceed the effects associated with irreversible morphological change (enhanced peat decomposition in gully margin locations).

AB The initial question of any ecological restoration project should be whether the degraded ecosystem may recover spontaneously in a reasonable time period or active intervention is needed. We examined the successional trajectories of vegetation within peatlands exploited by the traditional block-cut technique in Eastern Canada, with the final purpose of identifying sites which need human intervention to ensure the return of a typical Sphagnum-dominated bog community that accumulates C. Ordinations showed that the development of vegetation was different between three block-cut peatland regions. Peatlands of one of the regions were initially colonized by tall, dense ericaceous shrubs. There, communities tended to become increasingly dominated by trees and understories were closing over time, therefore not being on a trajectory toward the recovery of a Sphagnum-dominated system that accumulates peat in the future. Intervention is therefore recommended, for example by blocking still active drainage ditches. In the peatlands of the other two regions, Sphagnum had a high initial cover and remained dominant ten years later. However, species typically found in hummocks gained relative importance vs. those associated to hollows. More time is needed to decide whether these sites could be left unmanaged as they have remained after their abandonment 35 years ago.

TI CALCIUM CONCENTRATIONS IN WETLAND GROUNDWATER IN RELATION TO WATER
   SOURCES AND SOIL-CONDITIONS IN THE RECHARGE AREA

AB Over the past several decades, vegetation communities in lowland wetlands in Western Europe have changed. Species-rich, low-productivity (i.e. low primary biomass production) communities characteristic of rich fens (fens characterized by minerophilous species) have declined and are being replaced by vegetation communities characteristic of high-productivity rich fens, poor fens (fens characterized by ombrophilous species) and bogs. High concentrations of calcium in groundwater are generally believed to be an important controlling factor on the vegetation of rich fens. Management for the protection of low-productivity rich fens therefore generally aims at conservation of calcareous groundwater conditions in the root zone of lowland wetlands.
   This paper relates the occurrence of calcium-rich groundwater in lowland wetlands of the Central Netherlands to water sources and soil conditions in the groundwater recharge area. The chemical composition of the following groundwater types is compared: groundwater recharged at a sandy ridge adjacent to the wetland area (ridge water); groundwater recharged by precipitation within the wetland (peat water); groundwater recharged by surface water in the wetland. Objective hydrological criteria are used to classify groundwater analyses according to recharge area. Oxygen-18 proved an essential criterion for the distinction between genetic groundwater types. It is therefore recommended to make oxygen-18 analysis standard procedure in geohydrological wetland research. Calcium concentrations are generally not suitable as tracers of different types of recharge areas.
   All groundwater types contain calcium. In contrast to what is generally assumed, lowest concentrations are observed in ridge water. Higher calcium concentrations are found in groundwater recharged in wetlands, especially in infiltrated surface water. Nutrient concentrations in both ridge and peat water are low, while those in infiltrated surface water are significantly higher.
   The main conclusion for nature conservation is that calcium-rich and mesotrophic conditions in the root zone can be realised not only by the seepage of groundwater from upland sandy recharge areas, as is generally thought, but also by the seepage of peat water. This is important as a severe deterioration in the quality of ridge water seeping upward on the river plain may be anticipated in the near future. which forms a threat to low-productivity rich fens. Peat water may offer an alternative water source for the conservation or regeneration of low-productivity rich fens. forms at threat to low-productivity rich fens.

AB When restoring ecosystems, the simple removal of stresses causing degradation may seem preferable over other more costly and time consuming approaches. However, some restoration techniques can be implemented at reasonable cost and with increased efficiency in certain cases. We examined the successional trajectories of vegetation within abandoned block-cut peatlands in a major peat-producing region of Eastern Canada to evaluate whether the use of rewetting as a restoration technique can assist in the recovery of a typical bog plant community dominated by Sphagnum compared to spontaneous recolonization alone. We surveyed a total of 55 trenches in 6 peatlands twice, similar to 25 and similar to 35 years after the cessation of peat extraction. Canonical ordinations evidenced a generalized process of afforestation during the decade studied, partially driven by agricultural drainage in the surrounding landscape. Plant communities were dominated by ericaceous shrubs that hampered the spontaneous recovery of a Sphagnum-dominated system typical of bogs in the short and medium-term. Three of the six peatlands surveyed were partially restored by blocking drainage ditches. There, we surveyed plant composition in rewetted (28) and non-rewetted (26) trenches and observed that rewetting mitigated the increase in tree dominance, decreased the dominance by ericaceous shrubs, and favored the spread of non-vascular species with a wet habitat preference (notably Sphagnum species from the Cuspidata section). We conclude that the use of low intervention restoration techniques in block-cut bogs, such as the blockage of former drainage ditches, can re-orient undesired vegetation trajectories driven by spontaneous recolonization alone.

AB Identifying the processes controlling the carbon balance in northern peatlands is crucial for their integration in global climate models. As a first step, current models of peatlands dynamics need to be adequately evaluated to verify the consistency of processes before their integration in global models.
   We compared here the sensitivity of the total carbon mass of a peatland simulated by the Holocene Peat Model (HPM) derived from different sensitivity methods: a 'classic' local sensitivity analysis method and a global approach with the screening method.
   We observed that the conclusions drawn by the different methods are very different and, moreover, that it is not advisable to draw any general conclusion from a local one-at-a-time (OAT) experiment because the model space represented is very limited. The results also stressed that the representation of several processes, such as runoff or peat decomposition under different saturation conditions, lack sufficient empirical data and knowledge to be adequately represented in the model. In addition to the evaluation of the model per se, the exploration of its behaviour allowed us to observe simulations of two fen-bog transition patterns.
   This study showed that interactions between parameters should be taken into account when evaluating peatland dynamics models. The results of the screening method are useful for model improvement and simplification. Moreover, this method enables the exploration of model processes in detail, thus providing insight into peatland system dynamics. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Methane (CH4) production is often impeded in many northern peatland soils, even though more thermodynamically favorable inorganic terminal electron acceptors (TEAs) used in anaerobic respiration are often present in low concentrations in these soils. Recent studies suggest that humic substances in wetland soils can be utilized as organic TEAs for anaerobic respiration and may directly inhibit CH4 production. Here we utilize the humic analog anthraquinone-2, 6-disulfonate (AQDS) to explore the importance of humic substances, and their effects on the temperature sensitivity of anaerobic decomposition, in two peatland soils. In a bog peat, AQDS was not initially utilized as a TEA, but greatly inhibited the fermentative production of acetate by >98%, carbon dioxide by >49%, hydrogen by >90%, and CH4 production by 86%. When added together with glucose, <47% of added AQDS was reduced after a lag period of 5 to 10 days. In contrast, no inhibitory effect of AQDS on fermentation was found in a fen peat, and AQDS was readily reduced. The addition of glucose and AQDS to both bog and fen peats caused complicated temporal dynamics in the temperature sensitivity of CH4 production, reflecting temporal changes in the temperature responses of other decomposition processes with effects on methanogenesis. Our results show that the inhibitory effects of a humic analog on CH4 production depend on peatland type, acting primarily as a toxic compound in bog soils and as a competitive TEA in fen soils. The results also suggest that the high concentrations of humic substances in northern peatlands may impact the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon cycling in these ecosystems.

AB In the first of this pair of papers we introduced the conceptual and hydrological basis of the peatland development model-DigiBog. Here we describe the submodels which simulate (i) the production of plant litter, (ii) peat decomposition, and (iii) changes in peat hydraulic conductivity due to decomposition. To illustrate how the model works, DigiBog was applied to three example situations: Bogs 1, 2, and 3. For each, the net rainfall was held constant at 30 cm year(-1) and the oxic decomposition parameter kept at 0.015 year(-1). The anoxic decomposition parameter varied from 5 x 10(-6) (Bog 1) to 5 x 10(-4) year(-1) (Bog 3). Peatland development was simulated for 5000 years. For Bogs 1 and 2, plausible large peatland domes develop. Despite having a higher anoxic decomposition rate, Bog 2 grew thicker than Bog 1. This apparently counter-intuitive result is caused by the feedback between hydraulic conductivity and degree of peat decomposition. For both Bogs 1 and 2, DigiBog also simulates transitions from wet to dry states, demarked by sudden switches from poorly decomposed to well-decomposed peat moving upwards in the peat profile. These regime shifts result from internal peatland dynamics and not from allogenic influences, and challenge the view that peat properties are always a reflection of climate. In Bog 3, a mini-bog developed and persisted near the margin of the peatland; this bog can also be explained in terms of the internal feedbacks within the model.

AB Extraction of oil sands in the relatively dry Western Boreal Plains near Fort McMurray, Alberta, destroys the natural surface cover including fen peatlands that cover upto 65% of the landscape. Industry and environmental monitoring agencies have questioned the ability to reclaim fen peatlands in the post-mine landscape. This study proposes a conceptual model to replace fen systems with fen peat materials supported by groundwater inflow from a constructed watershed. A numerical model is used to determine the optimum system geometry, including the ratio of upland to fen area, thickness and slope of sand materials, and thickness of peat and of the liner that would result in flows that sustain peat wetness to a critical threshold soil water pressure of -100 cm of water at a peat depth of 10 cm. We also test the sensitivity of the system to variations in the value and spatial configuration of the hydraulic conductivity (K) of locally available materials. The optimal conditions were achieved using an upland area at least twice that of the fen, underlain by a sloping (3%) layer of fine-grained material with hydraulic conductivity (K) of 10(-10) m/s, that maintains lateral groundwater flow in a sand layer with K of 10(-4) to 10(-5) m/s. Using daily climate inputs that included 1998, the driest summer on record, the model suggests that adequate wetness can be sustained in the fen for the growing season, and that the extent of water table recession was similar to undisturbed systems during that period.

AB Macrofossil and chronostratigraphic data of a peat monolith extracted from a palsa within a subarctic permafrost peatland were used to reconstruct changes in vegetation and trophic conditions of the study site during the last 4500 cal y BP. The vegetation cover developed from Carex marsh or wet meadow to poor fen, bog, and to palsa peatland communities. The ombrotrophication was favoured by late-Holocene cooling and by the high peat accumulation. Permafrost inception began about 1660-1630 calibrated y BP, at the end of the Sphagnum accumulation stage. A comparison of the late-Holocene development of two peatlands in the same region (Arlen-Pouliot & Bhiry, 2005, and this study) suggests that permafrost initiation was due to a cool, dry climate associated with the Little Ice Age. However, Sphagnum cover prevented the permafrost from melting.

AB Understanding the development of northern peatlands and their carbon accumulation dynamics is crucial in order to confidently integrate northern peatlands into global carbon cycle models. To achieve this, northern peatland models are becoming increasingly complex and now include feedback processes between peat depth, decomposition, hydrology, and vegetation composition and productivity. Here we present results from a global sensitivity analysis performed to assess the behavior and parameter interaction of a peatland simulation model. A series of simulations of the Holocene Peat Model were performed with different parameter combinations in order to assess the role of parameter interactions on the simulated total carbon mass after 5000 years of peatland development. The impact of parameter uncertainty on the simulation results is highlighted, as is the importance of multiple parameter interactions. The model sensitivity indicates that peat physical properties play an important role in peat accumulation; these parameters are poorly constrained by observations and should be a focus of future research. Furthermore, the results show that autogenic processes are able to produce a wide range of peatland development behaviors independently of any external environmental changes.

AB South Africa has a limited number of peatlands and most of them are relatively small compared to those in cooler temperate regions in the northern hemisphere. We gathered 40 basal peat samples representative of South Africa's peatlands to explore their development during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. Depth profiles of nine of them were also investigated using radiocarbon dating, which yielded information on past environmental changes affecting South African peatlands. The data showed three peaks in the frequency of peatland initiation, which are consistent with available climatic and sea level fluctuation data: one after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and two during the Mid to Late Holocene. Inland peatlands in mountain valleys showed optimal growing conditions during the glacial-interglacial transition, continuing until the Early-Holocene. This is due to the switch to the wet and warm interglacial climate. In contrast, coastal peatlands showed optimal initiation conditions over two phases during the Holocene, which is consistent with sea level rise peaks that led to optimal moist conditions occurring ca. 6,000-3,000 and 1,000 years ago. Sea level rise reduced groundwater drainage, which led to a rise in the primary groundwater table. However, data from some of the coastal peatlands indicate independence from the sea level fluctuation, and that they are rather controlled by climatic conditions and their local hydrogeomorphic setting, e.g. perched groundwater aquifers. Some peatland complexes show a pattern of phased initiation with peat initiation consistent with altitude difference, which could be due to a positive feedback of blocking caused by peat accumulation in lower reaches, reducing groundwater drainage to the sea.

AB Background and aims Sphagnum mosses are ecosystem engineers that create and maintain boreal peatlands. With unique biochemistry, waterlogging and acidifying capacities, they build up meters-thick layers of peat, reducing competition and impeding decomposition. We quantify within-genus differences in biochemical composition to make inferences about decay rates, related to hummock-hollow and fen-bog gradients and to phylogeny.
   Methods We sampled litter from 15 Sphagnum species, abundant over the whole northern hemisphere. We used regression and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to evaluate general relationships between litter quality parameters and decay rates measured under laboratory and field conditions.
   Results Both concentrations of the polysaccharide sphagnan and the soluble phenolics were positively correlated with intrinsic decay resistance, however, so were the previously understudied lignin-like phenolics. More resistant litter had more of all the important metabolites; consequently, PC1 scores were related to lab mass loss (R-2 = 0.57). There was no such relationship with field mass loss, which is also affected by the environment. PCA also revealed that metabolites clearly group Sphagnum sections (subgenera).
   Conclusions We suggest that the commonly stated growth-decomposition trade-off is largely due to litter quality. We show a strong phylogenetic control on Sphagnum metabolites, but their effects on decay are affected by nutrient availability in the habitat.

AB The impact of cattle grazing on the vegetation of calcareous fens was compared to the effects of traditional autumn mowing in southern Germany. Vegetation composition was studied in adjacent pairs of fen meadows and pastures with similar environmental conditions and biomass production. Vegetation data were analysed with respect to species richness, species composition and response of species traits to disturbance, including morphology, defence mechanisms, clonal growth form and generative reproduction. Species richness was significantly reduced by grazing, but the percentage of typical fen species or Red Data Book species was not affected by land use type. Detrended Corrspondence Analysis indicated that species composition could best be explained in terms of a land use gradient. Species traits showed a clear trend in their response to land use type. Grazing favoured grasses and small forbs. Only a few species with defence mechanisms against foraging were more frequent or abundant on pastures. Many other species with defence mechanisms, however, did not have an advantage on pastures. Flowering and seed dispersal traits did not respond significantly to grazing or mowing. Species with fast spreading stem derived clonal organs were favoured on pastures, whereas all other clonal growth forms and, particularly, non-clonal species were more abundant on meadows. More indicator species of wet soil conditions and species adapted to flooding were found on pastures. Grazing can be recommended as an alternative land use to mowing in contrast to abandonment, but a reduction in species richness and changes in species composition and species traits may occur.

AB [1] Peatlands are sinks for carbon dioxide (CO2) because net primary production exceeds decomposition. The contribution of non-growing-season fluxes to the annual C budget of a peatland is, to date, little studied. We therefore measured the changes in the pattern of carbon exchange with seasons in a bog located in the cool temperate climate region. The growing season CO2-C uptake was of -113 g m(-2). During the non-growing season, 36 g C m(-2) was lost to the atmosphere, resulting in an estimated net ecosystem production of -76 g C m(-2). Despite the non-growing-season loss equaling 33 to 40% of the summer uptake, the net annual accumulation of was 3 times the long-term average net accumulation rate usually cited in the literature. The high rate of non-growing-season efflux could be supported directly by temporal concurrent respiration and the release of stored CO2 from prior production. These results indicate the need to revise current models to address peat thermal properties inducing CO2 production at lower temperature ranges.

AB Peatlands store similar to 20 %-30% of the global soil organic carbon stock and are an important source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for inland waters. Recent improvements for in situ optical monitoring revealed that the DOC concentration in streams draining peatlands is highly variable, showing seasonal variation and short and intense DOC concentration peaks. This study aimed to statistically determine the variables driving stream DOC concentration variations at seasonal and event scales. Two mountainous peatlands (one fen and one bog) were monitored in the French Pyrenees to capture their outlet DOC concentration variability at a high-frequency rate (30 min). Abiotic variables including precipitation, stream temperature and water level, water table depth, and peat water temperature were also monitored at high frequency and used as potential predictors to explain DOC concentration variability. Results show that at both sites DOC concentration time series can be decomposed into a seasonal baseline interrupted by many short and intense peaks of higher concentrations. The DOC concentration baseline is driven, at the seasonal scale, by peat water temperature. At the event scale, DOC concentration increases are mostly driven by a rise in the water table within the peat at both sites. Univariate linear models between DOC concentration and peat water temperature or water table increases show greater efficiency at the fen site. Water recession times were derived from water level time series using master recession curve coefficients. They vary greatly between the two sites but also within one peatland site. They partly explain the differences between DOC dynamics in the studied peatlands, including peat porewater DOC concentrations and the links between stream DOC concentration and water table rise within the peatlands. This highlights that peatland complexes are composed of a mosaic of heterogeneous peat units distinctively producing or transferring DOC to streams.

AB Peatland ecosystems store about 500-600 Pg of organic carbon, largely accumulated since the last glaciation. Whether they continue to sequester carbon or release it as greenhouse gases, perhaps in large amounts, is important in Earth's temperature dynamics. Given both ages and depths of numerous dated sample peatlands, their rate of carbon sequestration can be estimated throughout the Holocene. Here we use average values for carbon content per unit volume, the geographical extent of peatlands, and ecological models of peatland establishment and growth, to reconstruct the time-trajectory of peatland carbon sequestration in North America and project it into the future. Peatlands there contain similar to 163 Pg of carbon. Ignoring effects of climate change and other major anthropogenic disturbances, the rate of carbon accumulation is projected to decline slowly over millennia as reduced net carbon accumulation in existing peatlands is largely balanced by new peatland establishment. Peatland; are one of few long-term terrestrial carbon sinks, probably important for global carbon regulation in future generations. This study contributes to a better understanding of these ecosystems that will assist their inclusion in earth-system models, and therefore their management to maintain carbon storage during climate change.

AB Knowledge on the Sphaeriidae fauna in southern South America is significantly improved with the description of three new species of the genus Pisidium from Salta and Jujuy provinces (northwestern Argentina). This paper provides the first record of sphaeriids in restrictive high-altitude South American environments, particularly from very small water courses found in "vegas", exceptionally localized areas of 11 cushion vegetation" or "cushion peat bogs" developing between 2000-4000 m altitude in the Argentine pre-Andean ranges. Furthermore, the geographic distribution range of Pisidium chiquitanum Ituarte, 2001, only reported to date from the type locality in sub-Andean regions of central Bolivia, is considerably enlarged.

AB The restoration of peatlands is critical to help reduce the effects of climate change and further prevent the loss of habitat for many species of flora and fauna. The objective of this research was to evaluate RADARSAT-2 satellite imagery and high-resolution Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) to determine if they could be used as surrogates for monitoring the success of peatland restoration. Areas of peatland that were being actively harvested, had been restored from past years (1994-2003), and natural shrub bog in Lac St. Jean, Quebec were used as a test case. We compared the Freeman-Durden and Touzi decompositions by applying the Bhattacharyya Distance (BD) statistic to see if the spectral signatures of restored peatland could be separated from harvested peat and natural shrub bog. We flew Unmanned Aerial Surveys (UASs) over the study site to identifySphagnumandPolytrichum strictum, two indicator species of early peatland restoration success. Results showed that the Touzi decomposition was better able to separate the spectral signatures of harvested, restored, and natural shrub bog (BD values closer to 9). Symmetric scattering type alpha s1, Helicity |tau(1,2,3)|, a steep incidence angle, and peak growing season appear to be important for separating the spectral signatures. We had moderate success in detectingSphagnumandPolytrichum strictumvisually by using texture and pattern but were unable to use colour due to differences in sun angle and clouds during the UAS flights. Results suggest that RADARSAT-2 data using the Touzi decomposition and UAS imagery show potential for monitoring peatland restoration success over time.

AB Mississippian, Tournaisian, lycopsid megaspores isolated from lacustrine deposits of the Horton Bluff Formation at Three Mile Plains in Nova Scotia, Canada, are identified and illustrated by scanning electron microscopy. Three morphospecies of Sublagenicula: S. brasilliensis (Dijkstra) Glasspool, S. dulcis (Dijkstra) Dybova-Jachowicz et at, and S. variabilis (Winslow) Dybova-Jachowicz et al., one morphospecies of Auritolagenicula: A. angulata (Zerndt) Dybova-Jachowicz et al., three morphospecies of Lagenicula: L. subpilosa (Ibrahim) Potonie and Kremp, L. cervicornis (Winslow) comb. nov., and cf. L. rarispinosa (Dijkstra) Dybova-Jachowicz et al., one morphospecies of Setosisporites: S. aries (Winslow) Dybova-Jachowicz et al. and four megaspores assigned to Laevigatisporites cf. cheveriensis (Bell) comb. nov., are described. This assemblage is compared with other assemblages from contemporaneous strata in North America, Western Europe and North Africa. Gulate morphotaxa, which are considered to have been produced by an arborescent lepidodendropsid parent vegetation, dominate this assemblage, which is diverse in comparison with coeval assemblages and probably represents a lowland floodplain rather than a lycopsid-dominated mire vegetation.

AB Rewetting can strongly affect the matter balance of peatlands. Owing to evidence of increasing CH4 emissions and P mobilisation after rewetting, the effects of peatland restoration on climate, eutrophication risks and related controversies are discussed. Our study focuses on the role of helophytes in the carbon and nutrient balance of rewetted fen grasslands of NE Germany. We hypothesise that the helophytes Carex riparia, Glyceria maxima, Phalaris arundinacea, Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia differ in biomass production and nutrient standing stock according to site conditions and harvest time. We analysed the helophyte biomass three times a year and continuously measured water levels and quality. Biomass production, nutrient standing stock and litter accumulation were highly species specific and depended on nutrient availability, mean water levels and harvesting time. We conclude that helophytes store considerable amounts of carbon and temporarily improve the water quality by withdrawing high amounts of nutrients from the top soil during the growing season, and by reducing nutrient discharges. Restoring peatlands as effective nutrient and carbon sinks in the landscape should favour highly productive potentially peat-forming helophytes as Phragmites australis by establishing adequate water levels. If nutrients are to be removed from the degraded peatland, then management can combine the restoration of helophyte stands by rewetting with harvesting measures.

AB Processes affecting CO2 and CH4 emissions and their budgets have been relatively well studied in northern temperate peatlands, whereas similar studies are almost absent in southern Patagonia and the high-altitude Andean peatlands, both of which are currently under heavy anthropogenic pressure. Theobjectives of this study were to compare greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in natural and managed peatlands to examine the effect of management on GHG emissions and identify the environmental parameters affecting them. We analysed CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions related to the physical and chemical conditions of the peat: in a natural and managed transitional bog in Quebec, Canada, a natural paramo andgrazed peatland in the Colombian Andes, and a bog and a fen in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. GHG fluxeswere measured using the dark static chamber method. Groundwater table, temperature, O-2 content, pH and redox potential were measured from observation wells, soil temperature was measured at four depths, peat samples were analysed for pH, soil organic matter and dry matter content, P, K, Ca, Mg, NH4-N, NO3-N, total N and C. In all regions, human- impacted peatlands showed significantly higher CO2-C, N2O-N and CH4-C emissions than their natural counterparts. The Canadian managed transitionalbog showed the highest average CO2-C (575 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) and N2O-N (0.08 mg N m(-2) h(-1)) emissions, whereas the Colombian pasture was the largest emitter of CH4-C (2.35 mg C m(-2) h(-1)). CO2-C emissionswere controlled by soil temperature and C content, whereas CH4-C flux was negatively correlated to dissolved oxygen content in peat water, and positively to water table level and soil log (C/NO3-N) ratio. Total Inorganic Nitrogen (TIN), C/N ratio, and soil temperature were the main factors controlling N2O emissions. Intensive peatland management alters the soil C/N balance, and increases and leads to higher variability of GHG emissions. Agricultural activities, especially crop production in peatlands, as well asintensive grazing in mountain peatland pastures, are the main factors increasing GHG emissions in the peatlands studied. Mitigation is possible via regulation of grazing intensity and replacing arable fields with grasslands. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Plant macrofossil and testate amoebae analyses were conducted on a sedimentary core taken from a headwater peatland located near the summit of a hill at the northern extension of the Adirondack Mountains (Quebec, Canada). The aims were to reconstruct the developmental stages of the peatland and to examine the allogenous and autogenous factors associated with its long-term dynamics. Results were compared with a quantitative paleodimatic reconstruction based on the modern analog technique using pollen data from the same core. The long-term development of the peatland (pond-rich fen-intermediate fen-poor fen-bog) mainly reflects an autogenous hydroseral succession. Active peat accumulation under the relatively dry climate of the Early Holocene suggests that summer temperature was a critical factor in peat accumulation through enhanced biomass production. A major long-term decrease in net peat accumulation rates and a progressive decline of mean water-table depth occurred during the Mid- to late-Holocene (7900-500 cal yr BP), even though annual precipitation was abundant at the time. The high summer temperature associated to the highest evapotranspiration rates maintained a low water table which in turn led to strong humification of the peat. A similar, synchronous pattern in vertical peat accumulation dynamics characterized another nearby peatland. Based on these results, we suggest that small peatlands situated atop a watershed and/or within a small watershed are ecosystems sensitive to changes in precipitation and/or evapotranspiration, due to their limited water supply.

AB Using an isotope-mass balance approach and assuming the equimolar production of CO2 and CH4 from methanogenesis (e.g., anaerobic decomposition of cellulose), we calculate that the proportion of total CO2 production from methanogenesis varies from 37 to 83% across a variety of northern peatlands. In a relative sense, methanogenesis was a more important pathway for decomposition in bogs (8013% of CO2 production) than in fens (645.7% of CO2 production), but because fens contain more labile substrates they may support higher CH4 production overall. The concentration of CO2 produced from methanogenesis (CO2-meth) can be considered equivalent to CH4 concentration before loss due to ebullition, plant-mediated transport, or diffusion. Bogs produced slightly less CO2-meth than fens (2.91.3 and 3.71.4mmol/L, respectively). Comparing the quantity of CH4 present to CO2-meth, fens lost slightly more CH4 than bogs (89 +/- 2.8% and 82 +/- 5.3%, respectively) likely due to the presence of vascular plant roots. In collapsed permafrost wetlands, bog moats produced half the amount of CO2-meth (0.8 +/- 0.2mmol/L) relative to midbogs (1.6 +/- 0.6mmol/L) and methanogenesis was less important (42 +/- 6.6% of total CO2 production relative to 55 +/- 8.1%). We hypothesize that the lower methane production potential in collapsed permafrost wetlands occurs because recently thawed organic substrates are being first exposed to the initial phases of anaerobic decomposition following collapse and flooding. Bog moats lost a comparable amount of CH4 as midbogs (63 +/- 7.0% and 64 +/- 9.3%).

AB Alteration of the global nitrogen (N) cycle because of human-enhanced N fixation is a major concern particularly for those ecosystems that are nutrient poor by nature. Because Sphagnum-dominated mires are exclusively fed by wet and dry atmospheric deposition, they are assumed to be very sensitive to increased atmospheric N input. We assessed the consequences of increased atmospheric N deposition on total N concentration, N retention ability, and delta(15)N isotopic signature of Sphagnum plants collected in 16 ombrotrophic mires across 11 European countries. The mires spanned a gradient of atmospheric N deposition from about 0.1 up to about 2 g m(-2) yr(-1). Mean N concentration in Sphagnum capitula was about 6 mg g(-1) in less polluted mires and about 13 mg g(-1) in highly N-polluted mires. The relative difference in N concentration between capitulum and stem decreased with increasing atmospheric N deposition, suggesting a possible metabolic mechanism that reduces excessive N accumulation in the capitulum. Sphagnum plants showed lower rates of N absorption under increasing atmospheric N deposition, indicating N saturation in Sphagnum tissues. The latter probably is related to a shift from N-limited conditions to limitation by other nutrients. The capacity of the Sphagnum layer to filter atmospheric N deposition decreased exponentially along the depositional gradient resulting in enrichment of the mire pore water with inorganic N forms (i.e., NO3-+NH4+). Sphagnum plants had delta(15)N signatures ranging from about -8parts per thousand to about -3parts per thousand. The isotopic signatures were rather related to the ratio of reduced to oxidized N forms in atmospheric deposition than to total amount of atmospheric N deposition, indicating that delta(15)N signature of Sphagnum plants can be used as an integrated measure of delta(15)N signature of atmospheric precipitation. Indeed, mires located in areas characterized by greater emissions of NH3 (i.e., mainly affected by agricultural activities) had Sphagnum plants with a lower delta(15)N signature compared with mires located in areas dominated by NOx emissions (i.e., mainly affected by industrial activities).

AB The vegetation, environment, and ecological gradients present on three calcareous mires in the South Park valley, Park County, Colorado, were investigated. Vegetation was classified into four habitat classes, nine subclasses, and twelve species associations using two-way species indicator analysis (TWINSPAN). Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was used to ordinate vegetation samples along two axes representing the three predominant ecological gradients: water table height, miremargin to expanse, and region. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to directly relate local environmental conditions to vegetation. Water table depth, microtopographical development, soil and water pH and nutrient level, soil organic matter, and hydraulic head were significantly correlated with vegetation gradients. The mire soils consist of intermixed areas of organic and mineral soils. Mire soils and water are highly alkaline and nutrient-rich. Mean pore water calcium concentration on these mires is 115 mg/L, electrical conductivity averages 575 muS, and mean pH is 7.4. Owing to these conditions, the fen floras include a number of highly minerophilic species. Based on water chemistry and species criteria, each site was classified as rich to extremely rich fen, with the two fen types mixing in complex patterns according to local environmental conditions. The species Trichophorum pumilum, Salix candida, Salix myrtillifolia, Carex microglochin, Carex viridula, Carex scirpoidea, Eriophorum gracile, Triglochin maritimum, Triglochin palustris, Kobresia myosuroides, Kobresia simpliciuscula, Thalictrum alpinum, Scorpidium scorpioides, Scorpidium turgescens, and Calliergon trifarium were determined to be indicative of extremely rich fen conditions in the southern Rocky Mountains.

AB Grasslands established on drained peat soils are regarded as negligible methane (CH4) sources; however, they can still exhibit considerable soil CH4 dynamics. We investigated archaeal community composition in two different fen peat soils and one bog peat soil under permanent grassland in Denmark. We used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) fingerprinting and clone libraries to characterize the soils' archaeal community composition to gain a better understanding of relationships between peat properties and land use, respectively, and CH4 dynamics. Samples were taken at three different depths and at four different seasons. Archaeal community composition varied considerably between the three peatlands and, to a certain degree, also with peat depth, but seemed to be quite stable at individual sampling depths throughout the year. Archaeal community composition was mainly linked to soil pH. No methanogens were detected at one fen site with soil pH ranging from 3.2 to 4.4. The methanogenic community of the bog (soil pH 3.9-4.6) was dominated by hydrogenotrophs, whereas the second fen site (soil pH 5.0-5.3) comprised both aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Overall, there seemed to be a significant coupling between peat type and archaeal community composition, with local hydrology modifying the strength of this coupling.

AB Net primary production (NPP) and decomposition were measured in a suite of representative microsite types, and Ph-210 age was determined on near-surface peat in a hypermaritime sloping peatland in British Columbia, Canada. Hummock and depression communities had significantly higher aboveground NPP, and were characterized by higher moss NPP than other communities. Mass loss of a standard litter material was significantly different among the microcommunities, possibly because of the differences in microsite oxic conditions and water movement. Incubated litter material lost C and gained N during the 2-yr trial in all microcommunities, except for the Sphagnum austinii hummock, where N was lost at shallow depth. Low N content in the living Sphagnum and further N depletion in hummocks suggest that the hummock Sphagnum peat is recalcitrant to decomposition. Peat accumulation was found to be faster in hummock than in lawn communities. The hummock Sphagnum NPP and mass loss values were higher than published values for continental peatlands, possibly due to the wet and mild hypermaritime climate in this region. The recalcitrant nature of the litter and high NPP in hummocks likely account for rapid peat accumulation at the surface, whereas peat decomposition is most pronounced with depth, resulting in similar C sink strength as in hummocks in continental peatlands. Given that lawn community predominates, overall C sequestration capacity at the study site was estimated to be smaller than in continental peatlands. Possible range of C sink strength in sloping open peatlands in the hypermaritime region, therefore, is lower than or close to that in continental peatlands.

AB Large peatland complexes at the boreal-temperate ecotone are essential habitats for boreal species at their southern range limits where they are threatened by tree encroachment accelerated by climate change and nitrogen deposition. To inform vascular plant and biodiversity conservation, we studied tree encroachment patterns in a large (> 400 ha) boreal peatland complex in the northeastern United States across vegetation types and environmental gradients. We characterized vascular plant composition, environmental drivers and tree demography on 50 plots (each 25 m(2)). We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) to identify two main drivers of vascular plant composition in the herbaceous layer-pH and tree canopy openness-that described three broad plant community types (open bog, forested bog, and fen). Tree demography suggested that woody encroachment (i.e., tree seedling recruitment) varied across these community types; open bog was colonized byPicea marianaseedlings, while forested bog and fen (dominated by evergreen conifers,Picea marianaandThuja occidentalis, respectively) were colonized by deciduous tree species (Acer rubrumandBetula alleghaniensis). Our findings provide early warning signs of vegetation change in boreal peatlands near their southern range limits caused by the encroachment of temperate tree species into forested peatlands and expanding tree cover in open bogs.

AB The annual net CO2 exchange over undisturbed deep peatland in Scotland was measured continuously for 22 months using eddy covariance. Annual CO2 exchanges over peatlands that had been drained, ploughed and afforested with conifers 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 26 years previously were estimated by extrapolating two to four weekly measurements, using relationships between daytime fluxes and solar radiation and night-time fluxes and air temperature. The contribution of the trees to the overall net CO2 flux was estimated using a carbon accounting model, calibrated to fit conifer volume yield data. The carbon exchange of the peat and ground vegetation was then the difference between the overall carbon flux and the amount accumulated in trees and tree litter. The undisturbed peat accumulated similar to0.25 t C ha(-1) a(-1). Newly drained peatland (2-4 years after ploughing) emitted between 2 and 4 t C ha(-1) a(-1), but when ground vegetation recolonized, the peatland became a sink again, absorbing similar to3 t C ha(-1) a(-1) 4-8 years after tree planting. Thereafter, the trees dominated the budget and afforested peatlands absorbed up to 5 t C ha(-1) a(-1). Assuming that the trees accumulated carbon at rates commensurate with yield class 10 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1), the peat beneath the trees after canopy closure was estimated to be decomposing at only similar to1 t C ha(-1) a(-1) or less. This is slower than previously thought and suggested that afforested peatlands in Scotland accumulate more carbon in trees, litter, forest soil and products than is lost from the peat for 90-190 years.

AB Northern peatlands accumulate atmospheric CO2 thus counteracting climate warming. However, CH4 which is more efficient as a greenhouse gas than CO2, is produced in the anaerobic decomposition processes in pear. When peatlands are taken for forestry their water table is lowered by ditching. We studied long-term effects of lowered water table on the development of vegetation and the annual emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O in an ombrotrophic bog and in a minerotrophic fen in Finland. Reclamation of the pear sites for forestry had changed the composition and coverage of the field and ground layer species, and increased highly the growth of tree stand at the drained fen. In general, drainage increased the annual CO2 emissions but the emissions were also affected by the natural fluctuations of water table. In contrast to CO2, drainage had decreased the emissions of CH4, the drained fen even consumed atmospheric CH4. CO2 and CH4 emissions were higher in the virgin fen than in the virgin bog. There were no N2O emissions from neither type of virgin sites. Drainage had, however, highly increased the N2O emissions from the fen. The results suggest that post-drainage changes in gas fluxes depend on the trophy of the original mires.

AB Aims: Peat bogs are ecosystems with a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and varied characteristic structure. Nutrient poor peat bogs are one of the most important providers for maintaining the biodiversity of algae sensitive to eutrophication. However, they are also one of the most threatened oligotrophic biotopes in Europe. Algae, especially desmids and diatoms, are the dominant aquatic organisms in European peat bogs. Despite their importance, long-term algal species monitoring is limited, although it is a crucial aspect of algal biodiversity conservation. Study area: The acidic oligo-ombrotrophic Biale Lugi peat bogs located in the southern part of Poland. Methods: We sampled five peat bogs zones (riparian, alder carr, marshy coniferous forest, transitional mire and raised bog) in two summer vegetation seasons (2010 and 2011), and compared our findings with the algological material collected in 1996-1998, and also in 1999-2000, to assess local diversity of freshwater algae over the long-term. We examined diatom and desmid species diversity in acidic oligo-ombrotrophic peat bogs and determined the main environmental factors influencing their development. In each zone, physical (stream, river width, depth, temperature) and chemical (dissolved oxygen, conductivity and pH) data were collected. The color, water turbidity and concentration of orthophosphates, nitrates, ammonium nitrogen and sulfates were investigated. Results and conclusions: Altogether, we found 65 desmid and 115 diatom taxa. Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, phosphorus and iron concentrations were found to have a positive effect on the development and biodiversity of the studied algal assemblages. Significant differences occurred among the spatial distribution of desmids and diatoms in relation to the zone type. The highest Shannon H' diversity index was recorded for alder carr, whereas the lowest for the raised bog. Our results confirm that desmids and diatoms are dominant aquatic groups in Polish and European peat bogs and are strongly influenced by environmental factors.

AB Climate change is predicted to bring about a water level (WL) draw-down in boreal peatlands. This study aimed to assess the effect of WL on the carbon dioxide (CO2) dynamics of a boreal oligotrophic fen ecosystem and its components; Sphagnum mosses, sedges, dwarf shrubs and the underlying peat. We measured CO2 exchange with closed chambers during four growing seasons in a study site that comprised different vegetation treatments. WL gradient in the site was broadened by surrounding half of the site with a shallow ditch that lowered the WL by 10-25 cm. We modeled gross photosynthesis (P-G) and ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) and simulated the CO2 exchange in three WL conditions: prevailing and WL draw-down scenarios of 14 and 22 cm. WL draw-down both reduced the P-G and increased the R-ECO, thus leading to a smaller net CO2 uptake in the ecosystem. Of the different components, Sphagnum mosses were most sensitive to WL draw-down and their physiological activities almost ceased. Vascular plant CO2 exchange, en bloc, hardly changed but whereas sedges contributed twice as much to the CO2 exchange as shrubs in the prevailing conditions, the situation was reversed in the WL draw-down scenarios. Peat respiration was the biggest component in R-ECO in all WL conditions and the increase in R-ECO following the WL draw-down was due to the increase in peat respiration. The results imply that functional diversity buffers the ecosystem against environmental variability and that in the long term, WL draw-down changes the vegetation composition of boreal fens.

AB Peat layers are well represented in the Holocene coastal deposits of the southern North Sea and provide evidence as to the extent and nature of the fens and bogs that occupied the region in the mid and late Holocene. While natural processes contributed to their demise, without human interference extensive areas of peatland would remain. We review the characteristics of the vegetation of these peatlands along with the processes that influenced their development. Spatial and temporal trends are explored through the use of palaeogeographic maps from three areas: the East Anglian Fenland, the Romney Marsh area and the Netherlands. The palaeoecological evidence indicates that eutrophic vegetation promoted by rising relative sea level (RSL) dominated in the mid Holocene, with a trend towards the development of oligotrophic and ombrotrophic vegetation in the late Holocene as the rate of RSL rise declined. Nevertheless, areas of eutrophic vegetation appear capable of long-term stability with areas of fen woodland and herbaceous fen persisting at some locations for several thousand years in the mid and late Holocene. Areas of active peat growth in the region are now largely confined to small remnants within agricultural settings. To retain their characteristic biodiversity these remnants have been managed using traditional practices, although their small size and fragmented distribution limits their biodiversity value. Biodiversity concerns and the ecosystem services peatlands provide, notably carbon sequestration and flood attenuation, underlie recent restoration projects. These efforts are likely to receive additional impetus as a consequence of rising water levels, given projected rates of RSL rise. Future large-scale restoration can be informed by a greater understanding of the processes that formed and sustained coastal peatlands in the past. We identify advances in palaeoenvironmental research that could enhance restoration efforts and help maximise the ecosystem services delivered through such projects.

AB The agricultural use of peatlands, the stabilization of the substrate for building or road construction or for increasing the capacity of soil to support heavy machinery for industrial activities (peat and petroleum extraction), harvesting to provide peat for energy, and the growing media and initiation of chemical processes must be preceded by drainage. As a consequence of drainage, peat underwent an irreversible conversion into moorsh (secondary transformation of the peat). The object of the study was to investigate comparatively the organic matter composition and molecular structure of humic acids (HAs) in the raised bog, fen, and peat-moorsh soils developed in various compositions of botanical cover, peat-forming species, and oxic and anoxic conditions as a result of the oscillation of ground water during drainage as well as to evaluate the vulnerability of soil organic matter (SOM) to decomposition. Drainage was shown to be the principal factor causing the various chemical compositions and physicochemical properties of HAs. Large and significant differences in chemical composition of peat and the properties of HAs were found to be related to the degree of decomposition. The HAs from drained peatlands were less chemically mature. In contrast, the HAs from fen and raised bog were found to be more mature than that of the corresponding drained peatlands. The above findings showed the distinguishable structure of HAs within the soil profile created by the plant residue biodegradation and formed in both oxic and anoxic conditions. The analytical methods of thermal analysis together with the optical densities and paramagnetic behaviour are suitable and effective tools for studying structure-property relationships characterizing the origin and formation process of HAs in various environmental conditions.

AB In this study we address the question of the extent to which iron may be a limiting factor in restoring rich fens in the temperate climate zone of Europe. Rewetted fens that were heavily degraded in the past by draining over a long period, were compared with pristine fens or fens with slightly altered hydrological systems. The chemical composition of peat and of pore water was analysed and related to the composition of the vegetation of the fens. The species composition and chemistry of the topsoil of restored fens differed markedly from that of the other fens, while the chemistry of the pore water from deeper layers showed only minor differences. Multivariate analysis revealed that differences in species composition between both categories were strongly related to the concentration of Fe in the pore water in the topsoil. Restored sites with high iron concentrations in the pore water (> 100 mu mol.L-1) lacked many vascular plants and mosses typical of peat forming fens. Iron and inorganic phosphorus pools in the topsoil of most restored fens were much greater than in the reference fens. A higher soil phosphorus pool originated mainly from the iron-bound fraction. We conclude that these differences are strongly governed by local processes and not by regional differences in climate, which were associated with geographical distribution of the different fens studied. The strong accumulation of iron and phosphorus in restored fens is attributed to a long history of drainage, which enhanced the accumulation of oxidized iron in the topsoil and also lowered the concentrations of calcium, magnesium and sulphur through drainage-caused reoccurring oxidation-reduction and leaching processes. A high iron and associated high phosphorous content appears to be an important and possibly irreversible bottleneck to restoring biodiversity and accumulation of peat with a low degree of humification in degraded fens. If a degraded fen has a low iron content then it is more likely to be restorable.

   RESPONSES; PEATLAND; BOG
AB The first continuous multi-year measurements of the CO2 exchange between a subarctic fen and the atmosphere were conducted at Kaamanen in northern Finland (69degreesN). According to our six-year data-set, the fen is presently a sink of atmospheric CO2 with a mean rate of -22 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The interannual variation of the CO2 balances originates almost completely from the variations during the snow-free period, but the efflux in the wintertime constitutes a significant part of the annual balance. The snow melt timing is the most important single determinant of the annual carbon balance. In contrast to a commonly-held view, the hydrometeorological conditions during the growing season had only a minor effect on the annual balance, emphasizing the importance of year-round measurements. This study indicates that climate warming may increase the length of the growing season and thus benefit rather than threaten the carbon pool of subarctic peatlands.

AB Ring width (TRW) chronologies from Siberian (Pinus sibirica) and Scots (Pinus sylvestris) pine trees were sampled at Mukhrino - a large mire complex in central-western Siberia - to evaluate the impacts of hydroclimatic variability on tree growth over the last three centuries. For this purpose, we compared climate-growth correlation profiles from trees growing on peat soils with those growing on adjacent mineral soils. Tree growth at both peat and mineral soils was positively correlated to air temperature during the vegetation period. This finding can be explained by (i) the positive influence of temperature on plant physiological processes (i.e. growth control) during the growing season and (ii) the indirect impact of air temperatures on water table fluctuations. We observe also a strong link between TRW and the winter Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), especially in Siberian pine, reflecting the isolating effect of snow and limited freezing damage in roots. Significant negative relations were, by contrast, observed between bog TRW chronologies and hydroclimatic indices during spring and summer; they are considered an expression of the negative impacts of high water levels and moist peat soils on root development. Some unusually old bog pines - exhibiting >500 growth rings - apparently colonized the site at the beginning of the Little Ice Age, and therefore seem to confirm that (i) peat conditions may have been drier in Siberia than in most other regions of western Europe during this period. At the same time, the bog trees also point to (ii) their strong dependence on surface conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands play an essential role in the global carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. In order to ascertain the draining effects on recent accumulation rates of C (RERCA) and N (RERNA) in the Zoige peatland in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the core samples of peat growth, C and N accumulation for both natural and drained peatlands were measured using Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating methods. As a result, RERCA and RERNA showed an increasing trend from the bottom to the surface of the peatland, which was in accordance with the peat accumulation rates. However, the average RERCA in permanently flooded and seasonally flooded peatlands were 1.5-2.5 times that of drainage peatlands, and the average of RERNA were 1.2-1.7 times. Our findings indicate that the Zoige peatland is still in the stage of peat development with a large carbon sequestration capacity, and drainage from human activities leads to the decreasing of RERCA and RERNA, which will contribute to the selection of the effective ways to slow down the anthropogenic effects on the degradation of the Zoige peatland.

AB Groundwater discharge from an esker aquifer to a fen was studied to understand relevant hydrological processes for groundwater-surface water interaction in an esker-peatland hillslope. Piezometric levels of the peat layer and esker sand layer were continuously monitored and compared to climate data. Groundwater exfiltration points were spatially mapped and related to peat depth. The study showed a clear interaction between fen surface water and sand esker groundwater although the hydraulic conductivity of peat was low and the peat depth thick. In the artesian aquifer beneath the fen, the piezometric head showed a clear response to precipitation and evapotranspiration. Wetting of the peat is rapidly seen as pressure increase in the confined aquifer. This provides new information on hydraulics of wetlands found in aquifer discharge areas. Groundwater exfiltrated through thick peat layers in vertical preferential point discharges demonstrating how double porosity provides flow through the peat layer with low hydraulic conductivity in the peat matrix. The "pipe flow" channels were found in the deep peat area in the transition zones from deep peat to shallow peat. Diffuse seepage through the ditch bottom was found where ditches cut into the sand layer. Increased discharge through the ditch bed reduced the flow resistance at the aquifer boundary which can lower the groundwater level in the esker. The results show new processes in the groundwater discharge zone that are useful for groundwater modelling and policy development for future groundwater protection. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI Growth and vegetation history of alpine mires on the Old Man Range,

SO ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH

ID SOUTHERN NEW-ZEALAND; ISLAND
AB Alpine mires are widespread on the flat-topped mountains of Central Otago, the driest and most continental region in New Zealand. Feat profiles, pollen analyses, and radiocarbon dates are presented for several mires from the Old Man Range as part of a study of the environmental history of this region. Precipitation in the early Holocene may have been up to 30% less than that of the present, and peat accumulation was restricted to topogenous mires. Alpine ombrogenous bogs began growth at ca. 7500 BP. At the same time, forest and tall scrub spread in the adjacent lowlands in response to increasing rainfall, replacing grassland-shrublands. Feat accumulation was slow and episodic and declined to very low rates after 3000 BP, probably as a result of cooler winters and drier summers. Low levels of natural fire occurred throughout the Holocene. However, from 750 BP onwards, lowland forest and scrub was severely reduced, subalpine shrubland declined, and snow tussock grassland increased markedly as fires lit by Polynesian hunters swept the region. From A.D. 1850 onwards, European pastoralists introduced sheep and increased the burning of the uplands to improve grazing. Feat accumulation increased in topogenous mires after burning and grazing of the alpine grassland, possibly because of accelerated runoff and nutrient input.

AB Colonization by Scots pine of ground up to 850 m in the Northern Corries of Cairn Corm has been taking place for about 40 years, since the fencing of lower ground for commercial forestry and reductions in grazing pressure from red deer. Sapling densities were monitored in 1984 and 1994 along fixed transects. The highest densities were generally in the western corries of the series, but there were also substantial numbers in the ski area and in the eastern corries. The highest densities above 650 m were in the ski area. There were more saplings on ridges than in corries, and fewer than expected in mire vegetation. Densities increased between 1984 and 1994, with a higher proportion of seedlings to saplings at the second analysis. The age structure showed a slow progression towards that recorded for the natural tree-line at Creag Fhiaclach. Outside the part of the area designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest it might be possible to speed up the progression by additional planting or other measures.

AB The aim of the study was to document methane (CH4) dynamics from fen ecosystems in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) in northern Alberta to create a reference database for evaluation of peatland restoration and reclamation projects in the region. The study included three types of fens commonly occurring in this region: poor fen (open and treed), moderately-rich treed fen, and open saline fen (SF). We quantified CH4 fluxes, pore water concentration (PW[CH4]), and production potential together with ecohydrological variables that may influence CH4 dynamics over four growing seasons. Mean (standard deviation) fluxes for open and treed poor fen [99.8 (269.7) and 68.3 (118.8) mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1), respectively] were higher than for treed rich [32.8 (63.7) mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1)] and open SFs [34.6 (91.3) mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1)]. The total growing season CH4 emissions from these fens ranged between 3.7 and 11.3 g CH4 m(-2). Methane production potential varied from 0.1 (0.1) mu mol CH4 g peat(-1) day(-1) at the SF to 4.6 (0.8) mu mol CH4 g peat(-1) day(-1) at the treed rich fen. The variability of CH4 fluxes and pore water concentration between study sites and years was mostly controlled water table (WT) and soil temperature indicating that these variables should be used to assess the expected CH4 flux in peatland reclamation projects. Large inter-annual variability in CH4 flux illustrates the importance of multi-year records for data used in functional evaluation of restoration outcomes.

AB Hydrological dynamics act as a primary control on ecosystem function in mountain peatlands, serving as an important regulator of carbon fluxes. In western North America, mountain peatlands exist in different hydro geological settings, across a range climatic conditions, and vary in floristic composition. The sustainability of these ecosystems, particularly those at the low end of their known elevation range, is susceptible to a changing climate via changes in the water cycle. We conducted a hydrological investigation of two mountain peatlands, with differing vegetation, hydrogeological setting (sloping vs basin), and climate (strong vs weak monsoon influence). Growing season saturated zone water budgets were modeled on a daily basis, and subsurface flow characterizations were performed during multiple field campaigns at each site. The sloping peatland expectedly showed a strong lateral groundwater potential gradient throughout the growing season. Alternatively, the basin peatland had low lateral gradients but more pronounced vertical gradients. A zero-flux plane was apparent at a depth of approximately 50 cm below the peat surface at the basin peatland; shallow groundwater above this depth moved upward towards the surface via evapotranspiration. The differences in groundwater flow dynamics between the two sites also influenced water budgets. Higher groundwater inflow at the sloping peatland offset higher rates of evapotranspiration losses from the saturated zone, which were apparently driven by differences in vegetative cover. This research revealed that although sloping peatlands cover relatively small portions of mountain watersheds, they provide unique settings where vegetation directly utilizes groundwater for transpiration, which were several-fold higher than typically reported for surrounding uplands.

AB This study compares eddy-covariance measurements of carbon dioxide fluxes at six northern temperate and boreal peatland sites in Canada and the northern United States of America, representing both bogs and fens. The two peatland types had opposite responses of gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) to inter-annual fluctuations in water table level. At fens, wetter conditions were correlated with lower GEP and ER, while at bogs wetter conditions were correlated with higher GEP and ER. We hypothesize that these contrasting responses are due to differences in the relative contributions of vascular plants and mosses. The coherence of our results between sites representing a range of average environmental conditions indicates ecosystem-scale differences in resilience to hydrological changes that should be taken into account when considering the future of peatland ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration under changing environmental conditions.

AB Predicted daily fluxes from an ecosystem model for water, carbon dioxide, and methane were compared with 1994 and 1996 Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) field measurements at sites dominated by old black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) (OBS) and boreal fen vegetation near Thompson, Man. Model settings for simulating daily changes in water table depth (WTD) for both sites were designed to match observed water levels, including predictions for two microtopographic positions (hollow and hummock) within the fen study area. Water run-on to the soil profile from neighboring microtopographic units was calibrated on the basis of daily snowmelt and rainfall inputs to reproduce BOREAS site measurements for timing and magnitude of maximum daily WTD for the growing season. Model predictions for daily evapotranspiration rates closely track measured fluxes for stand water loss in patterns consistent with strong controls over latent heat fluxes by soil temperature during nongrowing season months and by variability in relative humidity and air temperature during the growing season. Predicted annual net primary production (NPP) for the OBS site was 158 g C.m(-2) during 1994 and 135 g C.m(-2) during 1996, with contributions of 75% from overstory canopy production and 25% from ground cover production. Annual NPP for the wetter fen site was 250 g C.m(-2) during 1994 and 270 g C.m(-2) during 1996. Predicted seasonal patterns for soil CO2 fluxes and net ecosystem production of carbon both match daily average estimates at the two sites. Model results for methane flux, which also closely match average measured flux levels of -0.5 mg CH4.m(-2). day(-1) for OBS and 2.8 mg CH4.m(-2). day(-1) for fen sites, suggest that spruce areas are net annual sinks of about -0.12 g CH4.m(-2), whereas fen areas generate net annual emissions on the order of 0.3-0.85 g CH4.m(-2), depending mainly on seasonal WTD and microtopographic position. Fen hollow areas are predicted to emit almost three times more methane during a given year than fen hummock areas. The validated model is structured for extrapolation to regional simulations of interannual trace gas fluxes over the entire North America boreal forest, with integration of satellite data to characterize properties of the land surface.

AB Although much attention in recent years has been devoted to methane (CH(4)) emissions from northern wetlands, measurement based data sets providing full annual budgets are still limited in number. This study was designed to help fill the gap of year-round measurements of CH(4) emissions from subarctic mires. We report continuous eddy correlation CH(4) flux measurements made during 2006 and 2007 over the Stordalen mire in subarctic Sweden (68 degrees 20'N, 19 degrees 03'E, altitude 351 m) using a cryocooled tunable diode laser. The landscape-scale CH(4) fluxes originated mainly from the permafrost free wet parts of the mire dominated by tall graminoid vegetation. The midseason average CH(4) emission mean was 6.2 +/- 2.6 mg m(-2) h(-1). A detailed footprint analysis indicates an additional strong influence on the flux by the nearby shallow Lake Villasjon (0.17 km(2), maximum depth 1.3 m). A stable bimodal distribution of wind flow from either the east or the west allowed separating the lake and mire vegetation signals. The midseason lake emission rates were as high as 12.3 +/- 3.3 mg m(-2) h(-1). Documented CH(4) fluxes are similar to results obtained by automatic chamber technique and higher than manual chamber measurements made in the wet minerotrophic section dominated by Eriophorum angustifolium. The high fluxes observed from this vegetation type are significant because the areal distribution of this source in the mire is expanding due to ongoing thawing of the permafrost. A simple peat temperature relationship with CH(4) emissions was used to fill data gaps to construct a complete annual budget of CH(4) fluxes over the studied area. The calculated annual CH(4) emissions in 2006 and 2007 equaled 24.5 and 29.5 g CH(4) m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. The summer season CH(4) emissions dominated (65%) the annual flux, with the shoulder seasons of spring and autumn significant (25%) and a minor flux from the winter (10%).

AB The importance of bogs in the catchment hydrology of the Australian Alps has been long recognised but little studied. Damaged bogs are thought to be the source of dried peats now common throughout the Alps. We described the characteristics of a bog peat and a dried peat, to better understand the relationship between the two. Standard chemical properties of peat were measured: pH, loss on ignition, gravimetric contents of carbon and nitrogen, and electrical conductivity. We also measured the concentrations of total and plant-available elements, and the chemical composition of the organic carbon, leading to a measure of the extent of decomposition. The results suggest that this is a typical Sphagnum bog peat - low pH, high carbon content - and the distribution of carbon groups and other elements reflect the stable water source of this groundwater-fed Sphagnum bog. The properties of the dried peat were most similar to the catotelm (lower layer) of the bog peat. This resemblance, combined with decades of field observations, indicates that dried peat may form from the catotelm of bog peat, after the acrotelm (upper layer) dries and erodes. These results have implications for the management of Alps catchments, and further studies are needed to ascertain the hydrologic and carbon cycling roles of organic soils in the Australian Alps.

AB Peatlands represent the largest and most concentrated carbon pool in the terrestrial biosphere, and their dynamics during the Holocene have had significant impacts on the global carbon cycle. In this Introduction paper, we provide an overview of the contributions presented in this Special Issue on Holocene peatland carbon dynamics. We also provide a brief history and current status of peat-core-based research on peatland carbon dynamics. Finally, we identify and discuss some challenges and opportunities that would guide peatland carbon research in the near future. These challenges and opportunities include the need to fill data gaps and increase geographic representations of peat carbon accumulation records, a better understanding of peatland lateral expansion process and improved estimate of peatland area change over time, developing regional carbon accumulation histories and carbon pool estimates, and projecting and quantifying overall peatland net carbon balance in a changing world.

AB We measured the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and respiration rates and modeled the photosynthesis and respiration dynamics in a cutover bog in the Swiss Jura Mountains during one growing season at three stages of regeneration (29, 42, and 51 years after peat cutting; coded sites A, B, and C) to determine if reestablishment of Sphagnum suffices to restore the C-sequestration function. From the younger to the older stage Sphagnum cover increased, while net primary Sphagnum production over the growing season decreased (139, 82, and, 67 g m(-2) y(-1) for A, B, and C respectively), and fen plant species were replaced by bog species. According to our NEE estimations, over the vegetation period site A was a net CO2-C source emitting 40 g CO2-C/m(2) while sites B and C were accumulating CO2-C, on average 222 and 209 g CO2-C/m(2), respectively. These differences are due to the higher respiration in site A during the summer, suggesting that early regeneration stages may be more sensitive to a warmer climate. Methane fluxes increased from site A to C in parallel with Eriophorum vaginatum cover and vascular plant leaf area. Our results show that reestablishing a Sphagnum cover is not sufficient to restore a CO2-sequestrating function but that after circa 50 years the ecosystem may naturally regain this function over the growing season.

AB A monolith of peat taken from an upland blanket mire at Talla Moss, southern Scotland, was subjected to peat humification and pollen analyses to produce both a proxy-climate record and a vegetational history covering the last 5500 years. While the pear showed little visible stratigraphy, with no intimation of major peat humification changes, colorimetric data indicate a markedly oscillatory climate record, which is apparently largely independent of, or out of phase with, major vegetational changes. The raw data imply particular wet shifts in climate at c. 3455 BP, c. 2600 BP, c. 1930 BP, c. 1095 BP, with a markedly wet (or cool and wet) episode commencing at c. 540 BP. (These are central age estimates, and should not be regarded as precise dates for the inferred climate shifts.) Other wet shifts apparently date from c. 3070 BP, c. 2265 BP and c. 1700 BP, although the first of these corresponds with pollen evidence for significant prehistoric human activity in the locality. Spectral analysis of the peat humification data, when expressed on an interpolated calibrated age-scale, suggests a cycle of c. 210 years; this is dependent on the accuracy of the radiocarbon chronology and should be treated with caution. The upland site is amenable to tephrochronology, which, if also applied to ombrotrophic mire sites elsewhere, might then permit more precise correlation and comparisons of proxy-climate data between sites.

AB The free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) and N deposition experiments on four ombrotrophic bogs in Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands and Switzerland, revealed that after three years of treatment: (1) elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration had no significant effect on the biomass growth of Sphagnum and vascular species; and (2) increased N deposition reduced Sphagnum growth, because it increased the cover of vascular plants and the tall moss Polytrichum strictum , while vascular plant biomass growth was not affected. This paper focuses on water chemistry, plant nutrient content, and litter decomposition rates. Potassium limitation, or low supply of K and P, may have prevented a significant increase of Sphagnum growth under elevated CO2 and N deposition. Vascular plant growth under elevated CO2 and N deposition was also limited by K, or by K in combination with P or N (N in CO2 experiment). Elevated CO2 and N deposition had no effect on decomposition rates of Sphagnum and vascular plant litter. Aside from a possible effect of N deposition on light competition between species, we expect that elevated atmospheric CO2 and N deposition concentrations will not affect Sphagnum and vascular plant growth in bogs of north-west Europe due to K-, or K in combination with N- or P-, limited growth. For the same reason we expect no effect of elevated CO2 and N deposition on litter decomposition. Net primary production of raised ombrotrophic bogs that are at or close to steady state, is regulated by input of nutrients through atmospheric deposition. Therefore, we hypothesize that the expected increase of plant growth under elevated CO2 and N deposition is diminished by current levels of K (and to some extent P and N) in atmospheric deposition.

AB To evaluate the contribution of proton flux from precipitation on peat acidification in mire ecosystems, we estimated ion fluxes to peat soils from bulk deposition in Sphagnum-dominated bogs and from throughfall plus stem flow in spruce forests in three cool-temperate ombrogenous mires in the Ochiishi district, northeastern Japan. We tested the hypothesis that proton fluxes from the atmosphere to peat soils are affected by vegetation types, leading to the consequent difference in soil acidity. The proton flux in bulk deposition was higher than that in throughfall plus stem flow, but the concentration of H+ in the peat surface water in Sphagnum bogs was lower than that in spruce forests. The inverse relationship between proton flux and soil water acidity means that the soil water acidity could not be explained quantitatively by proton flux from the atmosphere to the peat surface. The ion fluxes of sea-salt components were dependent on the distance from the coast to the mires. This means that the sea-salt accumulation in the peat surface soil can be directly attributed to the high flux of sea-salt from precipitation. The flux of sea-salts deposited on the mires positively correlated with the H+ concentration of the peat surface water in each community, implying that the acidity of peat surface water depends on the cation fluxes from precipitation.

AB Drier conditions caused by drainage for infrastructure development, or associated with global climate warming, may test the resilience of carbon-rich northern peatlands. Feedbacks among biological and hydrological processes maintain the long-term stability of peatlands, but if hydrological thresholds are passed, these feedbacks may be weakened, causing a shift in ecosystem state and potentially large losses of carbon (C). To determine peatland response to hydrological change, we examined the structure (vegetation composition and hydrology) and biogeochemical function (carbon dioxide exchange) of a pristine bog and a bog subject to similar to 7 years localised drainage (caused by regional groundwater drawdown due to mine dewatering) in the Hudson Bay Lowland, Canada. Water tables at the drained bog were similar to 1mbelow the hummock surface at the time of study compared to similar to 0.3mat the pristine bog. For hummocks and intermediate microforms at the drained bog, plant production was significantly less than at the pristine bog, most likely due to small changes in vegetation structure (reduced Sphagnum cover and smaller shrub leaf:stem ratios) caused by deeper water tables and significantly reduced moisture content of surface peat. Despite these changes in vegetation and hydrology, net ecosystem production (NEP) remained positive (C sink) for these microforms at the drained bog. Dry pools with mostly bare peat at the drained bog had negative NEP (C source to atmosphere), in stark contrast to Sphagnum- and sedge-dominated pools at the pristine bog with small but positive NEP. Our study shows that dry pools now occupy an unstable state, but the hydrological thresholds for a shift in ecosystem state have not yet been reached for hummocks and intermediate microforms at the drained bog. However, weak or no relationships between water table depth, peat surface moisture content, and plant production for these microforms at the drained bog, suggest that drainage has weakened the hydrological feedbacks regulating peat production, causing peat accumulation to slow. If drier conditions prevail, this reduced resilience increases the potential for a shift in ecosystem state and raises the risk of large C loss due to continued decomposition of deeper peat in oxic conditions, and wildfire.

AB Peatlands are globally important stores of carbon (C) that contain a record of how their rates of C accumulation have changed over time. Recently, near-surface peat has been used to assess the effect of current land use practices on C accumulation rates in peatlands. However, the notion that accumulation rates in recently formed peat can be compared to those from older, deeper, peat is mistaken - continued decomposition means that the majority of newly added material will not become part of the long-term C store. Palaeoecologists have known for some time that high apparent C accumulation rates in recently formed peat are an artefact and take steps to account for it. Here we show, using a model, how the artefact arises. We also demonstrate that increased C accumulation rates in near-surface peat cannot be used to infer that a peatland as a whole is accumulating more C - in fact the reverse can be true because deep peat can be modified by events hundreds of years after it was formed. Our findings highlight that care is needed when evaluating recent C addition to peatlands especially because these interpretations could be wrongly used to inform land use policy and decisions.

   history
SO VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY
LA English
DT Article
DE palaeoenvironment; human impact; raised bog; Massif Armorican
AB Logne, one of three raised bogs (Hochmoor) in the Massif Armorican, was officially designated as a nature reserve in 1987 and is of considerable ecological interest from botanical, ornithological and herpetological aspects. Palynological investigations reveal the history of local and regional vegetation during the last ca. 4000 years. From the end of the Neolithic Age to the present day, changes in the bog appear to have been considerably influenced by variations in local watertable level that may be of natural origin or caused by human activity. Alder carr with Osmunda regalis, which was the dominant vegetation around the periphery of the bog at ca. 4200 B.P., underwent many changes. Its final demise occurred in Gallo-Roman times when the local landscape took on a distinctly open appearance. The first clear evidence for cereal cultivation relates to the Bronze Age. After a decline in farming at the beginning of the Iron Age, there was a strong renewal of farming in the La Tene period, which included a distinct arable component and also records for Juglans and Castanea pollen. The timing of the introduction of walnut and chestnut to the Massif Armorican is discussed.

AB Globally, peatlands are regarded as important carbon stores and their conservation essential for ensuring continuation of terrestrial carbon storage. Numerous peatlands in particular regions of Europe have been degraded by drainage, burning, extraction, overgrazing and pollution in recent decades, often leading to erosion, loss of peat mass and a loss of a variety of flora. In the UK, some 90% of peatlands can be regarded as degraded. Implemented restoration schemes have been aimed at blocking drainage ditches, re-vegetating bare peat or changing the present vegetation assemblage to a more 'desirable' alternative. Here we use palaeoecological techniques to reconstruct the development of a blanket peatland through its entirety with a particular focus on recent land management practices and their impact on vegetation in order to determine and support restoration targets. Analysis at West Arkengarthdale, Yorkshire, UK, shows that the present vegetation is not characteristic and has only been present for c. 200 years. Peat has been developing at the site for approximately 6700 years with Sphagnum particularly abundant between 0-40 cm depth (present day-450 cal. BP) and 150-190 cm depth (c. 3200-3900 cal. BP) and seldom recorded elsewhere in the core. A very recent change in Sphagnum composition is seen towards the surface of the profile, with Sphagnum papillosum making up 100% of the identified Sphagnum in the last 50 years. Monocots, Poaceae, Rumex and Polytrichum commune increase with the beginning of the industrial revolution and an increase in charcoal fragments is indicative of increased pollution and managed burning to support grouse management. It is suggested that any intention to alter land management at the site to encourage a greater variety of Sphagnum species and a decrease in Calluna is in line with peatland development at the site over the past 450 years. This collaborative approach between research palaeoecologists and conservation agency staff has wider application elsewhere. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Question: What is the influence of hydrological regime, soils and management on the plant community composition and species richness of Skealoghan turlough (groundwater dependent calcareous wetland).
   Location: Skealoghan turlough, County Mayo, Ireland.
   Methods: Percentage cover of vascular plants and bryophytes were recorded, and data on hydrological regimes, soils and management were collected. Data were analysed using multivariate statistical techniques.
   Results: A total of 69 species of vascular plants and mosses were recorded. Cluster analysis grouped the samples into two separate communities, the Cirsio-Molinietum and the Ranunculo-Potentilletum anserinae plant communities. The plant community composition and species richness followed a main gradient down into the turlough basin, but also varied with microtopography, resulting in a mosaic of vegetation types.
   Conclusions: The biodiversity and conservation value of the site is linked to the heterogeneity in its physical environment in which hydrology, soils and grazing management all play critical roles.

AB This paper demonstrates the results of analyses of Cladocera, pollen, plant macrofossil, lithological and radiocarbon data recovered from a mire located in the Rawka River valley in central Poland. These studies permit to recognise the development of hydrology phases in Kopanicha mire and give insight into Holocene fluvial dynamics of the system; radiocarbon dating partly allowed da-ting of the patterns of Holocene valley floor development of the Rawka River. The Kopanicha mire was formed during the Atlantic period. At that time, an oxbow lake formed, becoming a mire during the Subboreal and possibly Subatlantic periods. The high sensitivity of the oxbow lakes, fens, fauna, and flora remains to climate variations - especially to changes in water level connected with the ag-gradation-erosion cycle of rivers - allows the reconstruction of the palaeoecological changes that oc-curred in the mire. The frequency and timing of hydroclimatic oscillations at Kopanicha show strong similarities to records from other sites in Poland. Changes in Cladocera frequency and plant assem-blages were mostly influenced by the Rawka River which controlled the hydrological regime of the mire. The main factors controlling the presence of Cladocera taxa were the water level and the pres-ence of favourable conditions in the mire (e.g. pH, vegetation). Most of the changes occurred in re-sponse to climate changes, but some of them were connected with local factors.

AB Strata of Westphalian D age on the western coast of the Sydney Basin expose a fossil forest of approximately 30 lepidodendrid trees within one of several elastic splits of the Harbour Seam. A mutidisciplinary approach was employed to interpret the origins of the coal bed, the depositional history of the site and the response of the fossil forest to changing edaphic conditions. The megaspore and miospore records indicate that the mire vegetation was dominated by arboreous lycopsids, especially Paralycopodites, with subdominant tree ferns. Petrographic, palynological and geochemical evidence suggest that the Harbour coal bed at Table Head originated as a rheotrophic (cf. planar) mire (eutric histosol). The mire forest is interpreted to have been engulfed by prograding distributary-channel sediments; sparse protist assemblages are suggestive of a freshwater delta-plain lake environment occasionally in contact with brackish waters. Lepidodendrids persisted as site colonizers of elastic substrates even after burial of the rheotrophic peatland and influenced the morphology of deposited sediment, but apparently were unable to colonize distributary channels. Equivocal taxonomic data (compression fossils) show the fossil forest to have been composed of both monocarpic (Lepidodendron) and polycarpic (Diaphorodendron, Paralycopodites, ?Sigillaria) lycopsids, genera recorded in the palynology of the uppermost ply of the underlying coal bed. Comparatively rare within the elastic beds of the fossil forest, however, is the stem compression of Paralycopodites, whose dispersed megapores and miospores dominate the underlying coal bed. Tree diameter data recorded equivalent to breast height indicate a forest of mixed age. These data would appear to suggest that some lepidodendrids employing a polycarpic reproductive strategy were better able to cross the ecological barrier imposed between peat and elastic substrates. Foliar compressions indicate that an understory or stand of Psaronius type tree ferns co-existed with the lepidodendrids on elastic substrates. which developed as incipient gleysol soils. The entombment of the forest can be ascribed to its distributary coastal setting, local subsidence and a seasonal climate that fostered wildfire and increased sedimentation.

AB 1. Many peatland ecosystems in Europe have become degraded in the last century owing to the effects of drainage, burning, pollution and climate change. There is a need to understand the drivers of peatland degradation because management and restoration interventions are expensive and can affect the natural ecohydrological dynamics of such sensitive environments. However, if given enough time, peatlands may have the ability to recover spontaneously without deliberate action.
   2. We use a detailed multiproxy palaeoecological data set from a degraded raised bog in Northern England to examine its ecosystem stability and long-term dynamics in response to anthropogenic disturbance over a variety of timescales. One feature of many degraded peatlands (including our study site) is the local dominance of Molinia caerulea (purple moor-grass), which has expanded at the expense of characteristic peatland plants, including sedges and Sphagnum mosses.
   3. Our data show that there has been a long history of human impacts at the site which have culminated in its current unfavourable condition. Several distinct episodes of past peat cutting are evident as hiatuses in peat accumulation; however, peat accumulation and plant community structure have subsequently recovered spontaneously. The appearance of M. caerulea occurs coevally with an unprecedented variety of recent anthropogenic impacts, all of which have contributed to providing a suitable environment for its rise to dominance. We have dated the appearance of M. caerulea to the latter half of the twentieth century which corresponds to a number of anthropogenic press disturbances, including the following: dust loading from post-war expansion of the adjacent quarry; burning; drainage; airborne pollution; and contamination from soil dust and agrochemicals.
   4. [Synthesis] Our study demonstrates the importance of palaeoecology for understanding the trajectories of peatland development and ecosystem dynamics, including their resilience and resistance to pulse and press disturbances. We show that peatlands have the capability to recover spontaneously from severe disturbances such as peat cutting, albeit on timescales much longer than those applied to contemporary monitoring of restoration efforts. The implications are relevant for determining whether it is preferable to manage and restore peatlands, or to allow them to recover naturally without human intervention.

AB Background/Purpose. Peat is a plant material that is decayed in anaerobic and acidic conditions. Peat is known for its pain relief effect on degenerative and rheumatologic diseases for hundreds of years. This research aims to see effects of peat intervention on knee osteoarthritis patients' pain, biomarkers, and parameters about gait. Methods. Knee osteoarthritis patients with Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of 3 or more and Kellgren-Lawrence osteoarthritis grades 1 to 3 were included. Patients with history of intraarticular injection treatment were excluded. Forty-one participants were randomly allocated to the peat intervention group (n = 22) or the hot-pack-only control group (n = 19). Peat and hot pack were applied to both knees of each group of patients. Each intervention session lasted 20 minutes, and eight sessions were completed over five days. VAS, serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), and gait parameters were evaluated before and after the whole interventions. Results. VAS in the peat group decreased from 6.000 to 3.409 after intervention (p<0.001) and also decreased in the control group from 5.737 to 4.421 (p<0.001). VAS score reduction between two periods was greater in the peat group than that in the control group (p<0.001). There was no significant difference in the serum COMP level in either intergroup or intragroup analysis. In gait analysis, the gait velocity of the peat group increased from 0.781 m/s to 0.873 m/s after intervention (p=0.002), while it decreased in the control group. The knee varus/valgus range of motion during gaits was reduced from 11.455 degrees to 8.439 degrees after intervention in the peat group (p=0.006). Conclusions. This study showed that peat can be considered as a therapeutic option for pain relief of knee osteoarthritis patients. The reduction in knee joint varus/valgus range of motion and the increase in gait velocity after peat intervention were also identified through this research, which is the first to analyze the effects of peat on gait.

AB Natural peatlands represent a long-term sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), however, drained and extracted peatlands can represent a source of atmospheric CO2. The restoration of Sphagnum mosses on abandoned milled peatlands has the potential to sequester atmospheric CO2 thereby returning the peatland to a peat accumulating system. Micrometeorological and chamber measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange are proven methods for investigating production and decomposition processes in both natural, extracted, and restored peatlands. However, this approach is relatively expensive because of infrastructure and human resources that not only limits potential use for ecological managers but it limits the number of sites that can be monitored due to high spatial variability. Here we present crank wire and destructive sampling production measurements, litter bag decomposition measurements and measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange made in a restored peatland and natural peatland sites nearby. The objectives were to assess production and decomposition rates in the two systems as well as to compare the different measurements techniques.
   Estimates of Sphagnum fuscum production at a restored peatland, using the different methods, followed the trend: crank wire < destructive sampling < gas exchange, with the two last methods providing comparable estimates. Production estimates using crank wires in cutover peat surfaces with a thin newly formed Sphagnum mat were shown unreliable due to peat subsidence. Results using the destructive sampling method suggest that Sphagnum production varies between species (S. fuscum > S. capillifolium) according to their ability to withstand harsh conditions on restored peat surfaces. Decomposition rate was also significantly greater (p < 0.05) for S. capillifolium than S. fuscum, resulting in an overall plant accumulation greater for S. fuscum. Although the restored surfaces were fairly young, production rates estimated on cutover surfaces that were fully covered with a thin Sphagnum mat compared with production rates observed in natural sites nearby.

AB Three independent methods were used to measure net ecosystem production (NEP) in four wetlands near Thompson, Manitoba, Canada. The first method calculated NEP by subtracting heterotrophic respiration from net primary productivity, using both measurements and estimates derived from the literature. The second method used radiocarbon data from cores to derive long-term NEP averaged over the past several decades. The third method used direct measurement of NEP combined with a model to fill in for days with no data. The three methods, with their independently derived uncertainties, ail show the same magnitude and pattern of NEP variation across four different wetland types. However direct measurement yielded distinctly lower estimates of NEP in the most productive sites. Highest NEP (31 - 180 gC m(-2) yr(-1)) was observed in the two wetlands with the highest proportion of sedge vegetation. A bog collapse scar and a nutrient-rich fen had NEP values not significantly different from zero. The maximum NEP at sites with intermediate nutrient status is due to slower overall decomposition and is likely associated with greater allocation of production below ground by sedges. The three methods for estimating NEP differ in the effort required, the sources of error, and in the timescale over which they apply. Used in combination, they allow estimation of parameters such as belowground production and the contribution of heterotrophic decomposition to total soil respiration. Using the radiocarbon method, we also derived estimates of the rate of N accumulation in the four wetland types.

AB Permafrost in peatlands strongly influences ecosystem characteristics, including vegetation composition, hydrological functions, and carbon cycling. Large amounts of organic carbon are stored in permafrost peatlands in northwestern Canada. Their possible degradation into permafrost-free wetlands including thermokarst bogs may affect carbon (C) stocks, but the direction and magnitude of change are uncertain. Using peat core reconstructions, we characterized the temporal and spatial variability in vegetation macrofossil, testate amoebae, C content, and peat decomposition along a permafrost thaw chronosequence in the southern portion of the Scotty Creek watershed near Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories. The accumulation of limnic and minerotrophic peat prevailed at the site until permafrost formed around 5000 cal. yr BP. Three distinct permafrost periods were identified in the permafrost peat plateau profile, while permafrost only aggraded once in the thermokarst bog profile. Permafrost thawed at similar to 550 and similar to 90 cal. yr BP in the thermokarst bog center and edge, respectively. Both allogenic (climatic shifts and wildfire) and autogenic (peat accumulation, Sphagnum growth) processes likely exerted control on permafrost aggradation and thaw. While apparent carbon accumulation rates (ACARs) were lower during present and past permafrost periods than during non-permafrost periods, long-term C accumulation remained similar between cores with different permafrost period lengths. Deep peat was less decomposed in the permafrost plateau compared with the thermokarst bog, which we speculate is due more to differences in peat type rather than differences in decomposition environment between these two ecosystem states. Our study highlights the importance of considering potential deep peat C losses to project the fate of thawing permafrost peat C stores.

AB Boreal peatlands in Canada have harbored relict permafrost since the Little Ice Age due to the strong insulating properties of peat. Ongoing climate change has triggered widespread degradation of localized permafrost in peatlands across continental Canada. Here, we explore the influence of differing permafrost regimes (bogs with no surface permafrost, localized permafrost features with surface permafrost, and internal lawns representing areas of permafrost degradation) on rates of peat accumulation at the southernmost limit of permafrost in continental Canada. Net organic matter accumulation generally was greater in unfrozen bogs and internal lawns than in the permafrost landforms, suggesting that surface permafrost inhibits peat accumulation and that degradation of surface permafrost stimulates net carbon storage in peatlands. To determine whether differences in substrate quality across permafrost regimes control trace gas emissions to the atmosphere, we used a reciprocal transplant study to experimentally evaluate environmental versus substrate controls on carbon emissions from bog, internal lawn, and permafrost peat. Emissions of CO2 were highest from peat incubated in the localized permafrost feature, suggesting that slow organic matter accumulation rates are due, at least in part, to rapid decomposition in surface permafrost peat. Emissions of CH4 were greatest from peat incubated in the internal lawn, regardless of peat type. Localized permafrost features in peatlands represent relict surface permafrost in disequilibrium with the current climate of boreal North America, and therefore are extremely sensitive to ongoing and future climate change. Our results suggest that the loss of surface permafrost in peatlands increases net carbon storage as peat, though in terms of radiative forcing, increased CH4 emissions to the atmosphere will partially or even completely offset this enhanced peatland carbon sink for at least 70 years following permafrost degradation.

AB A Holocene record of pollen, macrofossils, testate amoebae and peat humification is presented from a small montane bog. Sediment accumulation began before 9000 yr BP, but peat growth not until ca. 7000 BP. From 12 000 to 7000 yr BP, a shrub-grassland dominated under a dry climate, with increasing conifer forest and tall scrub from ca. 9600 yr BP. At 7000 yr BP a dense montane-subalpine low conifer forest established under a moist, cool climatic regime. Between 7000 and 700 yr BP the bog surface was shrubby, lending to be dry but with highly variable surface wetness. The catchment was affected by major fire at least four times between 4000 and 1000 yr BP. Both fire and bog surface wetness may have been linked to ENSO-caused variations in rainfall. Cooler, cloudier winters and disturbance by fire promoted the expansion of the broadleaf tree Nothofagus menziesii between 4000 yr BP and 1300 yr BP at the expense of the previous conifer forest-scrub vegetation. Polynesian fires (ca. 700 yr BP) reduced the vegetation to tussock grassland and bracken. Deforestation did not markedly affect the hydrology of the site. European pastoralism since AD 1860 has increased run-off and rising water tables in the bog have led to a Sphagnum-dominated cover. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Stream and wetland-landscape patterns in watersheds that drain active-cranberry bogs, abandoned-cranberry bogs, and forest land with no history of cranberry agriculture were compared at three different levels of detail. Stream-pattern variables included drainage density, sinuosity, and the number, density, and length of ditches. Landscape-pattern measures included wetland-patch structure (the size, shape, and number of wetland patches) and cover-type composition. The results of the stream-pattern analysis indicated that the effect of past and present cranberry agriculture on stream-drainage patterns was limited primarily to the occurrence of ditches. A greater number, density, median length, and total length of ditches were observed in cranberry and abandoned-bog basins compared to forest basins. Drainage density and sinuosity of the remaining non-ditched stream segments did not differ between basin types. Excluding areas of active-cranberry bogs where the native vegetation was removed, there was no significant difference in the relative number, size, shape, and composition of the remaining vegetation-cover types between the three basin types. The exact type and extent of vegetation removed to establish bogs in the active and abandoned basins are not known, but based on soil type and vegetation class associations, it was estimated that the largest losses were of pitch pine lowlands and cedar swamps.

AB We investigated the changes of water level and vegetation in a restored cut-over raised bog in response to a hydrological protection zone established around the bog. The restoration began 1997 and techniques involved ditch blocking within and around the bog to stimulate a return to conditions of intact bog ecosystems. In order to monitor the rehabilitation of the raised bog, water levels and vegetation have been recorded since before restoration measures began. The monitoring is ongoing, but an assessment of 15 year's data (1994-2008) is presented. A hydrological protection zone with continuous high water levels could be established around the raised bog which minimizes the runoff of precipitation. Shortly after the first measures, the water levels increased significantly at all dipwells. Parallel to the increasing water levels a vascular plant species assemblage and a diverse Sphagnum community developed. In particular Sphagnum fimbriatum, S. palustre, S. recurvum and S. squarrosum spread efficiently. The cover of trees decreased significantly because of high water levels and ongoing acidification by Sphagnum spp. The high water levels have stimulated the re-vegetation and the hydrology self-regulation of the acrotelm. The successful regeneration of the acrotelm particularly became apparent in years with below-average precipitations (e.g. 2008), when the water levels in the central parts of the raised bog did not fall back to the low level reached in previous years, which had also remarkably water deficits (e.g. 2003).

AB The bryophyte component of peatland vegetation is analysed for 395 stands on 335 study sites in western Canada.  Sites are located along a broad transect from the Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia to southeastern Manitoba.  The climate in the study area is divided into five zones:  hyperoceanic, oceanic, suboceanic, subcontinental.  A TWINSPAN analysis separated the stands into six groups and selected indicator species for each group.  A DCCA ordination showed that surface water chemistry, climate, and height above the water surface are the most influential gradients distinguishing between stand groups and indicator species.  Response surfaces are generated for 31 indicator species along three gradients:  pH, height above the water table, and climate as determined by calculating an aridity index.
   Hyperoceanic, oceanic, and suboceanic fens and bogs are characterized by Sphagnum tenellum, S. austinii, S. rubellum, S. papillosum, Rhytidiadelphus loreus, and Racomitrium languinosum.
   Continental fens and bogs are, in general, characterized by Aulacomnium palustre.  These continental mires are further classified into neutral and acidic fens (and bogs) characterized by Sphagnum warnstorfii and wet, extreme-rich fens having Calliergon trifarium, Scorpidium scorpiodes, Drepanocladus revolvens and Campylium stellatum as indicator species.  Spagnum-dominated fens and bogs are dominated by S. magellanicum, S. angustifolium and S. fuscum.  Further divisions of the stand classification recognized wet poor fens with Sphagnum riparium and S. jensenii; dry fens and bogs with Polytrichum strictum, Dicranum undulatum, and Drepanocladus uncinatus; dry poor fens and bogs with Pleurozium schreberi; dry rich fens with Tomenthypnum nitens, and moderate-rich fens with such indicators as Drepanocladus aduncus, D. polycarpus, and D. vernicosus.
   Response surfaces quantify the abundances of individual species along several gradients and are an efficient means of determining responses of bryophyte species to various chemical and physical gradients over a broad cimatic regime.

AB We analysed the response of microbial communities, characterized by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), to changing hydrological conditions at sites with different nutrient levels in a southern boreal peatland. Although PLFAs of Gram-negative bacteria were characteristic of the peatland complex, microbial communities differed among sites (ombrotrophic bog, oligotrophic fen, mesotrophic fen) and sampling depths (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30 cm). The microbial communities in each site changed significantly following water-level drawdown. The patterns of change varied among sites and sampling depths. The relative proportion of Gram-negative bacteria decreased in the upper 10 cm but increased in deeper layers of the fen sites. Fungi benefited from water-level drawdown in the upper 5 cm of the mesotrophic fen, but suffered in the drier surfaces of the ombrotrophic bog, especially in the 5-10 cm layer. In contrast, actinobacteria suffered from water-level drawdown in the mesotrophic fen, but benefited in the drier surfaces of the ombrotrophic bog. Basal respiration rate correlated positively with pH and fungal PLFA, and negatively with depth. We suggest that the changes in microbial community structure after persistent water-level drawdown follow not only the hydrological conditions but also the patterns of vegetation change. Our results imply that changes in structure and activity of the microbial community in response to climate change will be strongly dependent on the type of peatland.

AB Calcareous mires are peat forming systems fed by calcareous groundwater that regularly deposit travertine (CaCO3) on the soil surface or in small pools that are present in such mires. At present almost all calcareous mires in Poland are degraded, most often by land use, which has led to disturbances in local hydrological systems. An experiment was set up in a degraded spring mire in western Poland to test if travertine deposition could be restored. Trees were removed to increase surface water temperatures, and a system of open water pools was constructed to measure CaCO3 deposition in the surface water. We also studied three references systems with active CaCO3 deposition in Poland and in Latvia. The pools in the restoration site in Poland showed very little CaCO3 deposition (less than 0.2 mu g center dot cm(-2) center dot d(-1)), while the Polish reference site had significantly higher, but still modest, rates of CaCO3 deposition (ca 0.8 mu g center dot cm(-2) center dot d(-1)). At the reference sites in Latvia, we measured considerable CaCO3 deposition (up to 8 mu g center dot cm(-2) center dot d(-1)). Five years after the restoration measures in the Polish restoration site had been carried out, the vegetation showed little resemblance to the vegetation in spring systems with active calcite deposition in Poland and Latvia. Water analyses showed that the water in our restoration project was not supersaturated by calcite and had very low CO2 concentrations compared to the reference areas. The CO2 concentrations in the pool seemed a good predictor for CaCO3 deposition, better than Ca2+ concentrations. Changes in ground water flows in the source area could have been responsible for the loss of supersaturated groundwater at our restoration site. Our study showed that efforts to restore former calcareous mires can be frustrated when groundwater flow paths have been altered.

AB In peatlands the balance between litter input and decay loss in the oxic acrotelm determines the rate of carbon input to the anoxic catotelm with carbon lost at very slow rate. In the acrotelm the C/N-quotient decreases with depth and indicates the loss of carbon from the acrotelm. On one boreo-nemoral and three subalpine ombrotrophic bogs in Sweden the carbon losses in the acrotelm plus the apparent carbon-accummlation rates in the catotelm for the last millennium revealed a constant carbon-sequestering rate up to the end of the nineteenth century equalling that in recent Sphagnum-dominated communities. On the boreo-nemoral bog the carbon-accumulation rate in the catotelm decreased by 50% over the same period while it remained constant on the subalpine bogs. A catotelm with permafrost may have provided more constant conditions for the carbon accumulation than a rising water level creating anoxic conditions. Due to vegetation changes, the recent carbon sequestering in the peat-forming communities is lower than previously and only just enough to compensate for the integrated losses. It is argued that because of internal processes the bogs up to the end of the nineteenth century had obtained or were approaching a steady-state with regard to the carbon input to the catotelm and the supply of mineral nutrients. In contrast, an increased climatic humidity around 1000 cal. BP resulted in high carbon-accumulation rates in the boreo-nemoral bog. Climate could have triggered the recent vegetation changes, but an increased nitrogen deposition is also a probable reason.

AB The geochemical differentiation of major elements in various peat bog profiles from Bieszczady Mountains Region (south-east of Poland) was compared to its botanical origin. Peat cores were taken from ombrotrophic, mesotrophic, and oligotrophic peatlands, which were developed in the stream valley of the River San. Twenty-four various peat samples were analysed for peat genus, degree of peat decomposition, ash content, total nitrogen, and total carbon content of hydrolytic matter as well as content of major elements: Na, K, Mg, Ca. The results show that the botanical composition of peat deposits is no reliable indication of their trophic status. The common feature of investigated Holocene peatlands is their valley localisation on the flood terrace. The specific character of local geomorphological and hydrological condition caused that the bottom layer of all investigated bog profiles was made of wood peats (Piceaeti, Pineti, Alneti, and Saliceti peat). The geochemical investigations of stratigraphical profiles confirm that the presented peat bogs showed specific morphological separateness comparing to other raised bogs situated in mountains or lowlands.

AB The material described as "mineral matter" in coal encompasses dissolved salts in the pore water and inorganic elements associated with the organic compounds, as well as discrete crystalline and non-crystalline mineral particles. A range of technologies, including but not restricted to low-temperature oxygen-plasma ashing, may be used to evaluate the total proportions of minerals and other inorganic constituents in a coal sample. The relative proportions of the individual minerals in the coal may be further determined by several different techniques, including Rietveld-based X-ray powder diffractometry, computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy (CCSEM), and non-native interpretation of chemical analysis data. The mode of occurrence of particular minerals may be evaluated by optical or electron microscopy techniques.
   The minerals in coal may represent transformed accumulations of biogenic constituents such as phytoliths and skeletal fragments, or they may be of detrital origin, introduced as epiclastic or pyroclastic particles into the peat bed. Other minerals are produced by authigenic precipitation, either syngenetically with peat accumulation or at a later stage in cleats and other pore spaces by epigenetic processes. They may represent solution and reprecipitation products of biogenic and detrital material, or they may be derived from solutions or decaying organic matter within the peat bed. Non-mineral inorganics may be derived from a range of subsurface waters, and possibly redistributed within low-rank seams by post-depositional ion migration effects. They may also be expelled in different ways from the organic matter with rank advance.
   Quantitative analysis of minerals and other inorganics contributes significantly to defining coal quality. It may also be useful as an aid to stratigraphic correlation, either between seams in a coal-bearing sequence or between sub-sections within an individual coal bed. Mineralogical analysis may help in identifying the mode of occurrence and mobility of particular trace elements, including potentially toxic components such as arsenic and mercury. Knowledge of the mineral matter can also be used to evaluate the behaviour of particular coals in different utilization processes, including the processes that control the characteristics of fly ashes, stags and other combustion by-products.

AB Ombrotrophic peatlands have provided important archives for understanding Holocene palaeoenvironmental change. However, records are predominantly from raised bogs due to potential issues regarding preservation of proxy indicators, record length and low temporal resolution in other peat types including blanket bogs. By carrying out peat depth and stratigraphy surveys we demonstrate how blanket peatlands can provide archives capable of providing records that are not reliant on single proxies, as has been often the case in the past, and can provide good resolution records. A record containing humification, testate amoebae and plant macrofossils was derived for the last 3000 years with accumulation rates as high as 8 yrs cm(-1) providing favourable temporal resolution, particularly over the last 1500 years. Major changes in proxy indicators reflecting potential changes in water-table depth were often coherent with changes in climate. Human activity also had a major impact on the peatland throughout the record especially in the last 100 years where the influence of wildfire and managed burning, together with an effect of atmospheric pollution, fundamentally changed the state of the peatland.

AB The objective of this paper is to assess the accuracy of C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets in mapping peat-land types over a region of Canada's subarctic boreal zone. This paper assessed contributions of quad-polarization linear backscatter intensities (sigma degrees HH, sigma degrees HV, sigma degrees VV), image textures, and two polarimetric scattering decompositions: 1) Cloude-Pottier, and 2) Freeman-Durden. Four quad-polarimetric RADADSAT-2 images were studied at incidence angles of 19.4 degrees, 23.1 degrees, 45.8 degrees, and 48.1 degrees. The influence of combining dual-angular information acquired within a short temporal span was also assessed. These C-band SAR data were used to classify peatlands according to isolated flat bogs (bogs), channel fens (fens), raised peat plateaus (plateaus), and forested uplands (uplands) using a supervised support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Numerous classifications were examined to compare the unique contributions of these variables to classification accuracy. Results suggest linear backscatter variables in isolation produce comparable classification results with those of the Freeman-Durden and Cloude-Pottier decompositions. Combining polarimetric decomposition and texture data into classifications with linear backscatter data resulted in only minor (similar to 1-3%) improvement. Combining classifications from small and large incidence angles (dual-angular) significantly improved classification results over those of a single image. Classification accuracy was the highest for isolated bogs and open water surfaces, whereas fens, uplands, and plateaus had lower accuracies. The highest accuracy classification (84% and kappa coefficient of 0.80) used a dual-angular approach, with additional decomposition and texture information. However, it is noted that texture information rarely improved classification results across all tests. This approach identified isolated flat bogs, channel fens, and raised peat plateaus with >76% producer's accuracies.

AB This study investigated the response of freshwater wetland vegetation to hydrological driving factors by assessing collective vegetation variables, traits of dominant plant populations and hydrological and hydrochemical variables, repeat-sampled within wetland sites across Scotland and northern England. Sampling was conducted at 55 permanent sample stations located along 11 independent transects. Eco-hydrological interactions were investigated using a regression-based modelling approach. Facets of the water-table dynamic (e.g., level of drawdown, level of fluctuation), along with vegetation abundance (e.g., biomass, stem density) and diversity (e.g., species richness) values, were used to build predictive models. Of the models predicting vegetation characteristics, the greatest predictive power was R-2 = 0.67 (p < 0.001) for a model predicting stem density (m(-2)). Conversely, vegetation variables proved useful for predicting characteristics of the water-table environment. In this instance, the greatest predictive power was R-2 = 0.79 (p < 0.001) for a model predicting minimum water table level (i.e. maximum level of drawdown). The models were tested using data collected during 2000 from repeat sites and independent sites. This approach might be successfully applied for the purposes of integrated eco-hydrological management and monitoring of freshwater wetland vegetation.

AB Fully integrated physically based hydrological modeling is an essential method for increasing hydrological understanding of groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions in peatlands and for predicting anthropogenic impacts on these unique ecosystems. Modeling studies represent peat soil in a simplistic manner, as a homogeneous layer of uniform thickness, but field measurements consistently show pronounced spatial variability in peatlands. This study evaluated uncertainty in groundwater levels and exfiltration fluxes associated with the simplified representation of the peat soil layer. For transferability of the results, impacts of selected topographical and hydrogeological conceptual models on GW-SW exchange fluxes were simulated in a hypothetical hillslope representing a typical aquifer-mire transect. The results showed that peat soil layer geometry defined the simulated spatial GW-SW exchange patterns and groundwater flow paths, whereas total groundwater exfiltration flux to the hillslope and groundwater level in the peatland were only subtly altered by different conceptual peat soil geometry models. GW-SW interactions were further explored using different scenarios and dimensionless parameters for peat hydraulic conductivity and hillslope-peatland system slope. The results indicated that accurate representation of physical peat soil properties and landscape topography is important when the main objective is to model spatial GW-SW exchange. Groundwater level in virtual peatland was not greatly affected by groundwater drawdown in an adjacent aquifer, but the magnitude and spatial distribution of GW-SW interactions was significantly altered. This means that commonly used groundwater depth observations near peat-mineral soil interfaces and within peatlands may not be a suitable indicator for monitoring the hydrological state of groundwater-dependent peatland ecosystems.
   Key Points
   Peat soil layer geometry controls spatial pattern and extent of simulated groundwater exfiltration flux Landscape slope and porous media hydraulic properties control total groundwater exchange flux magnitude more than peat layer geometry Hydrological impact of groundwater drawdown near groundwater-fed peatlands is not captured by monitoring peatland groundwater levels alone

   Surface Scheme

ID CONDUCTIVITY; SOILS; WETLAND; MODEL
AB A hydraulic parametrization is developed for peatland environments in the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS). Three wetland soil classes account for the typical variation in the hydraulic characteristics of the uppermost 0.5 m of organic soils. Review of the literature reveals that saturated hydraulic conductivity varies from a median of 1.0 x 10(-7)m/s in deeply humified sapric peat to 2.8 x 10(-4) m/s in relatively undecomposed fibric peat. Aver age pore volume fraction ranges from 0.83 to 0.93. Parameters have been designed for the soil moisture characteristic curves for fibric, hemic and sapric peat using the Campbell (1974) equation employed in CLASS, and the van Genuchten (1980)formulation. There is little differance in modelled soil moisture between the two formulations within the range of conditions normally found in peatlands. Validation of modelled water fable depth and peat temperature is performed for a fen in northern Quebec and a bog in north-central Minnesota. The new parametrization results in a more realistic simulation of these variables in peatlands than the previous version of CLASS, in which unrealistic mineral soil "equivalents" were used for wetland soil climate modelling.

AB The initial conditions for the development of a large peatland complex in the St Lawrence Lowlands were reconstructed to increase the understanding of early development and expansion modes in this region. Peatland basin morphometry was identified by creating a model based on over 1500 existing peat depth measurements, and six cores were extracted along transects from a central (deepest) location towards the margins. C accumulation rates and ecohydrological conditions were reconstructed from plant macrofossils, testate amoeba assemblages and C-14 chronologies. Luminescence dating was performed to better delineate the timing of dune stabilization in the area and potentially related climate changes. Shallow freshwater plant communities acted as nuclei for the development of a rich minerotrophic fen around 10300cal. a BP in the deepest part of a shallow depression at the surface of the St-Maurice river delta. Peat inception was followed by the paludification of peripheral parabolic dune systems. Luminescence dating suggested dune stabilization between 11500 and 10900years ago. The initial rich fen persisted until 9500cal. a BP, and was replaced by a poor fen dominated by sedges as a result of a decrease in mineral nutrient influx from upland runoff. The shift to ombrotrophic conditions in the oldest section of Lac-a-la-Tortue peatland started around 5150cal. a BP. This major ecohydrological change coincides with those observed in several other peatlands in southern Quebec. Variations in carbon and peat accumulation rates in both ombrotrophic and minerotrophic sectors appear to have been primarily controlled by hydroseral succession, peat-forming vegetation, hydrological conditions, topography and fire activity. This study is the first to provide a quantification of the total carbon pool of a peatland complex in southern Quebec at 6.39 Mt C, corresponding to a mean C mass per area of 96.9kgCm(-2) (sigma=50.60kgCm(-2)).

AB We measured net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) (NEE) during wet and dry summers (2000 and 2001) across a range of plant communities at Mer Bleue, a large peatland near Ottawa, southern Ontario, Canada. Wetland types included ombrotrophic bog hummocks and hollows, mineral-poor fen, and beaver pond margins. NEE was significantly different among the sites in both years, but rates of gross photosynthesis did not vary spatially even though species composition at the sites was variable. Soil respiration rates were very different across sites and dominated interannual variability in summer NEE within sites. During the dry summer of 2001, net CO2 uptake was significantly smaller, and most locations switched from a net sink to a source of CO2 under a range of levels of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The wetter areas-poor fen and beaver pond margin-had the largest rates of CO2 uptake and smallest rates of respiratory loss during the dry summer. Communities dominated by ericaceous shrubs (bog sites) maintained similar rates of gross photosynthesis between years; by contrast, the sedge-dominated areas (fen sites) showed signs of early senescence under drought conditions. Water table position was the strongest control on respiration in the drier summer, whereas surface peat temperature explained most of the variability in the wetter summer. Q(10) temperature-respiration quotients averaged 1.6 to 2.2. The ratio between maximum photosynthesis and respiration ranged from 3.7:1 in the poor fen to 1.2:1 at some bog sites; it declined at all sites in the drier summer owing to greater respiration rates relative to photosynthesis in evergreen shrub sites and a change in both processes in sedge sites. Our ability to predict ecosystem responses to changing climate depends on a more complete understanding of the factors that control NEE across a range of peatland plant communities.

AB Methane emissions from mires in all climate-vegetation zones of West Siberia (forest steppe, subtaiga, south taiga, middle taiga, north taiga, forest tundra and tundra) were measured using a static chamber method. The observed fluxes varied considerably from small negative values in forested bogs and palsa to hundreds of mgC m(-2) h(-1) in ponds and wet hollows. Observed data were consolidated in the form of the empirical model of methane emissions designated as the 'standard model'. The model is based on medians of CH4 flux distributions of eight different micro-landscape types depending on their location and estimated duration of methane emission period within the climate-vegetation zone. The current version (Bc8) of the 'standard model' estimates methane flux from West Siberia mires at 2.93 +/- 0.97 TgC CH4 yr(-1) that accounts for about 2.4% of the total methane emission from all mires or 0.7% of global methane emission from all sources.

AB Predicting the trajectory of ongoing diversity loss requires knowledge of historical development of community assemblages. Long-term data from palaeoecological investigations combined with key biodiversity measures in ecology such as taxonomic richness, functional diversity (FD), phylogenetic diversity (PD) and environmental factors expressed as Ellenberg indicator values (EIVs) could provide that knowledge. We explored the modern pollen-plant (moss polster pollen vs. surrounding vegetation) diversity relationships for herbaceous and woody taxa in calcareous fens from two different regions in Estonia, NE Europe. Associations of taxonomic richness, vegetation composition, FD (including functional alpha diversity and trait composition), PD and EIVs in modern pollen vs. plant data were studied with correlation analysis, Procrustes analysis and linear regression models. To test their potential use in palaeoreconstructions, diversity measures were applied on pollen data from Kanna spring fen reflecting fen vegetation development over the last nine millennia and diversity changes through time were studied using generalized additive models. Results showed significant pollen-plant richness correlations for herbaceous taxa at vegetation estimate scales up to 6 m radius and Procrustes analysis showed significant compositional associations at all plant estimate scales (up to 100 m). Woody taxa had no significant pollen-plant richness correlations but composition relationships were significant at plant estimate scales of 6-100 m. Traits that were best reflected by pollen data (both in terms of trait composition and functional alpha diversity) among woody and herbaceous taxa were seed number, clonality, SLA and LDMC. PD of herbaceous species was reflected by pollen data. Among the EIVs, Ellenberg L and T were significantly reflected by pollen data for both woody and herbaceous communities. Palaeoreconstruction from Kanna fen indicates that trends of woody taxa are mostly related to long-term changes in climate while diversity variables of herbaceous taxa closely follow autogenic processes within the fen. We suggest that pollen-based diversity estimates should be calculated separately for woody and herbaceous taxa as they clearly represent different spatial scales. Present study suggests that linking sedimentary pollen data with FD, PD and EIVs provides possibilities to examine long-term trends in community assembly and ecosystem processes that would be undetectable from traditional pollen diagrams.

AB Soil samples were taken from two transects (total 63 sampling points; 25 cm quadrats) representing the Betula pubescens (Betulaceae) woodland, rush-pasture and peat-based mire vegetation of the west coast and Highlands of Scotland, in an attempt to relate soil and vegetation features to the occurrence of Culicoides impunctatus Goetghebuer larvae.  The covers of vegetation groups were recorded at each sample site and soil wetness was assessed on an arbitrary scale.  Culicoides spp. larvae were extracted from half of each sample and stored for subsequent identification of C. impunctatus larvae, while the remaining half was used for analysis of soil pH and organic content (loss on ignition, LOI).  Correspondence analysis (using DECORANA) separated the sample sites and vegetation groups and the ordination axes were significantly correlated with the density of C. impunctatus larvae, soil organic content and soil wetness index.  Simple regression analyses revealed that the density of Juncus acutiflorus/J. articulatus (Juncaceae) and soil wetness index were positively related to the overall variation in C. impunctatus larval density.  The wetness index had the strongest relationship and this remained the case in step-wise multiple regression.  There was no relationship between larval density and soil pH.  This information on the specific microhabitat preferences of the larvae could aid colonization attempts of this dominantly important species of biting midge in the UK.

AB Mire vegetation phenology is closely linked to the ecosystem carbon cycle but rarely monitored and quantified with high temporal resolution. In this study, we use digital repeat photography to explore phenology as a control of the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange measured by eddy covariance (EC) in a minerogenic boreal mire in northern Sweden over 2 years (2011-2012). Strong correlations and seasonal hysteresis effects were observed between the green chromatic coordinate (g (cc)) derived from the digital image archive and leaf area index, day length, and growing degree-day sum (GDDS). Differences in GDDS between the 2 years were the main control on the between-year variations in the spring patterns of g (cc). Periods with lower water table level coincided with an increase of the red chromatic coordinate. The onset and magnitudes of EC-derived photosynthetic CO2 uptake (that is, gross ecosystem production, GEP) and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) during the spring green-up of vascular plants were more closely related to those of g (cc) than to those of air temperature and photosynthetically active radiation. In contrast, abiotic variables controlled GEP during the summer period when vascular plant canopy cover was fully developed. Stepwise regression analysis suggested that g (cc) contributed substantially in explaining variations in GEP during spring and autumn. Over both growing seasons, g (cc) was well correlated with GEP (r (2) = 0.68), NEE (r (2) = 0.58), and ecosystem respiration (r (2) = 0.50). Overall, we show that digital repeat photography provides an inexpensive and effective method for the continuous quantification of the phenological patterns of the vascular plant community in mire ecosystems. Our results suggest that vegetation phenology is an important control of the mire CO2 exchange and should be considered in both experimental and modeling studies to better account for the separate effects of phenology and abiotic drivers on mire carbon dynamics.

AB Anthropogenic disturbance (drainage and peat harvesting works in adjacent area) accelerates water outflow from and mineralization of top peat layer in the raised bog of Aukstumala Telmological Reserve (Western Lithuania) thus inducing peatland degradation and promoting penetration of atypical plant species and woody vegetation. Possibilities of restoration of the most affected parts of the Aukstumala raised bog (contact zone of the bog and peat harvesting fields) were investigated. Specifically, we aimed to assess effectiveness of two different means of hydrological regime restoration installed in the contact zone: (i) bog isolation from peat harvesting fields (to prevent direct water runoff) using polyethylene membrane (PM measure, installed in November 2006) and "peat lock" system (PL measure: water runoff blocked by highly decomposed peat; installed in November 2010), and (ii) blocking of ditches of the old drainage system using peat dams (PD measure, installed in November 2012). The research was carried out by performing monthly (from April to October) water level measurements in a system of water level monitoring profiles installed in zones of impact of each measure and non-treated (control) areas. Moreover, dendrochronological analysis of pine growth was performed in PM-treated and control areas.
   Although in general positive effect of the applied treatments (raised water table, reduced amplitudes of seasonal water level fluctuation, reduced radial increment of pine trees, re-establishment of Sphagnum cover) could be observed, none of the three measures has fully restored hydrological regime to create favourable conditions for peat accumulation and thriving of typical raised bog communities. The results of the present study suggest that aiming to more efficiently regulate hydrological regime in drainage-affected parts of the Aukstumala raised bog, blocking or filling of the old drainage system should always be applied in combination with the installation of water insulation measures along the contact zone of the bog and peat harvesting fields. Longer observation time is needed to fully assess the effect of the installed restoration measures on hydrology and ecosystem functioning in the raised bog of Aukstumala Telmological Reserve.

AB Northern peatlands are among the most carbon-rich ecosystems on Earth, but many unanswered questions remain regarding linkages between their long-term developmental processes and climatic variability. In this paper, we present a detailed paleoecological reconstruction of the developmental history of a kettle peatland in northern Wisconsin, USA (Fallison Bog) based on 21 coring locations and temporally constrained by 69 radiocarbon dates. This record of within-basin developmental history is compared to a regional dataset containing estimated ages of peatland establishment for 75 core samples collected from 37 depressional peatlands throughout the Great Lakes Region. Finally, our data are used to develop a spatially explicit model of whole-system carbon accumulation in Fallison Bog, which distinguishes between carbon pools stored in limnic sediments and peat deposits. Results indicate that peatland development in Fallison Bog was episodic and spatially complex. Peatland development was related to the morphology of the underlying basin and characterized by pulses of both terrestrialization and paludification. Major episodes of terrestrialization centered on 4980 and 3180 years before A.D. 1850 (cal yr BP), with less extensive episodes occurring around 3840, 1060, 670, and 410 cal yr BP. Extensive peatland area developed by paludification of shallow portions of the basin around 2040 cal yr BP. The timing of peatland development within Fallison Bog was correlated with the timing of peatland development in other depressional peatlands across the Great Lakes Region (r = 0.70), suggesting a common climatic driver. Comparison of peatland development in Fallison Bog and independent paleoclimate records suggested that both millennial-scale and sub-centennial-scale variability in moisture balance influenced spatiotemporal patterns of peatland development. Model results indicated that Fallison Bog accumulated similar to 6655 t of carbon during the Holocene, with 66% of this total stored in peat deposits that have accumulated in only the last similar to 5000 years. Collectively, model results and the strong correlation between the timing of within-basin and regional pulses of peatland establishment imply that depressional peatlands likely experienced climate-sensitive and episodic changes in carbon accumulation rates during the Holocene, and similar dynamics could be expected in response to ongoing and future climatic change.

AB The Karlich-Seeufer archaeological site in Germany's central Rhineland was excavated between 1980 and 1992. The site provides evidence for hominid activity during a Middle Pleistocene interglaciation known up to now only from the Karlich day pit and therefore defined as the Karlich Interglaciation, which is considered to be post-Cromer IV and pre-Holstein (sensu stricto) in age, The site is characterized by Acheulean artifacts, a fauna dominated by Elephas (Palaeoloxodon) antiquus, and a unique and outstanding preservation of wooden and other palaeobotanical remains. Assuming all finds are associated, the site previously was interpreted as an elephant hunting camp with a wooden structure, together with wood and bone implements preserved in situ. Recent analysis of the same features has shown that the site can also be interpreted as a reworked archaeological sample, Hominid occupation occurred in the vicinity of a small, lake with prevailing meso-oligotrophic conditions. Expanding boreal forests and fen vegetation characterized the landscape. (C) 1996 University of Washington.

AB A study of more than 70 fens in the Midwestern United States and a review of the literature indicates that these temperate zone wetlands may differ from fens of the boreal zone and are not adequately differentiated from them by present classification systems. Fens of the Midwestern temperate zone 1) are wetlands with high botanical diversity, 2) are supported in part by ground water with conductivity > 100mS/cm and circumneutral pH, 3) contain water in the root zone during most of the growing season yet are not usually inundated, and 4) accumulate organic and/or carbonate substrates. Individually, none of these descriptors is adequate to distinguish fens from other wetland communities of the Midwest such as marshes, sedge meadows, and wet prairies; yet, when they are taken together, such discrimination is possible. While fens of this zone share many species, our study does not support using indicator species because too few are both faithfully represented and geographically widespread. Midwestern temperate fens are sustained by forces of climate, landscape, and geology, which permit ground water to seep continuously into the root zone in a focused location. Since water availability in the temperate Midwest is less than in the boreal zone, continuous discharge is needed to maintain the saturation conducive to peat formation.

AB Hydrological processes maintain wetlands, whose position in the landscape determines their character and possible response to climate change. We studied such responses to long periods of climate change in a large groundwater fed fen (Mfabeni Mire), which is one of the oldest fen systems in South Africa. The geological and geomorphological setting of the mire was studied as well as its stratigraphy and chronology. The basal peat of the mire was at a depth of 9.9 m dated at ca. 44,000 cal years Before Present (BP). The average accumulation rate during the Late Pleistocene was 0.15 mm/year. During the Holocene it was higher (0.3 mm/year). Despite climate change over this period, peat formation has hardly been interrupted, suggesting that the system has been able to almost continuously sustain peat formation processes. This is possible because the peatland is situated in a valley that is bordered by a highly permeable sand dune cordon with an elevated groundwater table that directs groundwater towards the mire. The mulling of the valley by peat has resulted in a basin with lower permeability than in the surrounding dunes, forcing the water table in the adjacent aquifer to rise, thus ensuring the mire system a supply of groundwater that is large enough to dampen the effects of climatic variation.

AB Background: In fens, plant species composition is predominantly controlled by two environmental factors: root anoxia and low nutrient availability. Aims: We asked how these filters were reflected to the functional structure of plant communities in natural and drained rich fens. Methods: We analysed traits related to species response to anoxia and nutrient availability, using single-trait and multi-trait approaches in fens of a river valley (Biebrza, Poland). We evaluated results concerning multi-trait indices using a null model consisting of simulated communities. Results: Mycorrhizal status and specific leaf area (SLA) clearly distinguished the communities with different levels of anoxia and nutrient deficiency. Mean values, ranges and variance of canopy height showed the differences in the distribution of plant heights among analysed communities. Conclusions: Functional traits distinguish plant communities of the most endangered mesotrophic fens from eutrophic and drained fens. We highlight the role of nutrient and oxygen deficiency in the assembly of fen vegetation and show the impact of the altered environment on the composition of communities in degraded habitats. We demonstrate that single-trait indices are suitable for identifying of environmental filtering in different types of fen communities. We suggest that caution is justified when using multi-trait indices to assess vegetation patterns.

AB A much improved understanding of how water-table fluctuations near the surface affect decomposition and preservation of peat-forming plant litter and surficial peats is needed in order to predict possible feedbacks between the peatland carbon cycle and the global climate system. In this study peatland plants (bryophytes and vascular plants), their litter and peat cores were collected from the Ryggmossen peatland in the boreonemoral zone of central Sweden. The extracted insoluble residues from whole plant tissues were depolymerized using thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) in the presence of both unlabelled and C-13-labelled tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) which yielded both vascular plant-and Sphagnum-derived phenols. Methylated 4-isopropenylphenol (IUPAC: 1-methoxy-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)benzene), methylated cis-and trans-3-(4'-hydroxyphen-1-yl)but-2-enoic acid (IUPAC: (E/Z)-methyl 3-(4-methoxyphenyl)but-2-enoate), and methylated 3-(4'-hydroxyphen-1-yl)but-3-enoic acid (IUPAC: methyl 3-(4-methoxyphenyl)but-3-enoate) (van der Heijden et al., 1997) are confirmed as TMAH thermochemolysis products of "bound" sphagnum acid and also as being specific to Sphagnum mosses. These putative biomarkers were also significant components in the unlabelled TMAH thermochemolysis products from the depolymerization of ultrasonically extracted samples from eight peat cores, one from a hummock and one from a hollow at each of the four stages along the bog plateau-to-swamp forest gradient. We have proposed and measured two parameters namely (i) sigma which is defined as the total amount of these four molecules normalised to 100 mg of OC; and (ii) an index (SR%) which is the ratio of sigma to the K parameter giving a measure of the relative amounts of "bound" sphagnum acid to the "bound" vascular plant phenols in peat moss and the surficial peat layers. Changes in sigma and SR% down the bog plateau (BP), bog margin (BM) and fen lagg (FL) cores in the Ryggmossen mire indicates that the sphagnum acid bound into the peat is being degraded in the unsaturated and seasonally-saturated layers. There is then a stabilisation of Sphagnum-derived phenols in the deepest horizons of the seasonally-saturated layer and into the permanently-saturated layer. These results suggest that "bound" sphagnum acid will be stabilised in peatlands shifting to a wetter and more variable precipitation regime whereas it will be gradually stripped away (e. g. by hydrolysis/enzymatic activity) in surficial peats shifting to a drier climate, such that any subsequent rewetting of the peat could lead to anaerobic hydrolysis and fermentation of the newly exposed carbohydrates. This highlights the sensitivity of Sphagnum surficial peats to climate-induced changes in water levels albeit there may be differences in the extent of degradation along the bog-fen gradient.

AB Characteristic species of sedge-moss fen communities occur in constantly wet, nutrient-poor sites with a high penetration of light through the vegetation canopy. We studied the effects of water table depth and differences in light intensity on the performance of fen species. Three fen species (Carex curta, Viola palustris, Hydrocotyle vulgaris) and one species with a wide range of occurrence (Poa trivialis) were grown for 10 weeks in a sedge-moss peat substrate at 4 different water levels and 3 light intensities. In all species differences in light availability had a larger effect on biomass production than differences in water level. Under a light availability reduced to only 10% the root weight ratio of all the species decreased while leaf weight ratio increased. The biomass allocation ratios were hardly affected by differences in water level. For Viol a and Hydrocotyle an interaction between the two factors was observed. Poa did not show particular differences compared to the other species. We discuss the results in the context of the establishment of fen species in riparian vegetation. It is suggested that the occurrence of fen species in the landscape is directly related to the availability of light, whereas the relationship between fen species occurrence and hydrological conditions seems to be an indirect one.

AB Peatlands are important carbon reserves in terrestrial ecosystems. The microtopography of a peatland area has a strong influence on its carbon balance, determining carbon fluxes at a range of spatial scales. These patterned surfaces are very sensitive to changing climatic conditions. There are open research questions concerning the stability, behaviour and transformation of these microstructures, and the implications of these changes for the long-term accumulation of organic matter in peatlands. A simple two-dimensional peat microtopographical model was developed, which accounts for the effects of microtopographical variations and a dynamic water table on competitive interactions between peat-forming plants. In a case study of a subarctic mire in northern Sweden, we examined the consequences of such interactions on peat accumulation patterns and the transformation of microtopographical structure. The simulations demonstrate plausible interactions between peatland growth, water table position and microtopography, consistent with many observational studies, including an observed peat age profile from the study area. Our model also suggests that peatlands could exhibit alternative compositional and structural dynamics depending on the initial topographical and climatic conditions, and plant characteristics. Our model approach represents a step towards improved representation of peatland vegetation dynamics and net carbon balance in Earth system models, allowing their potentially important implications for regional and global carbon balances and biogeochemical and biophysical feedbacks to the atmosphere to be explored and quantified.

AB It is anticipated that a lowering of the water table and reduced soil moisture levels in peatlands may increase peat decomposition rates and consequently affect nutrient availability. However, it is not clear if patterns will be consistent across different peatland types or within peatlands given the natural range of ecohydrological conditions within these systems. We examined the effect of persistent drought on peatland nutrient dynamics by quantifying the effects of an experimentally lowered water table position (drained for a 10-year period) on peat KCl-extractable total inorganic nitrogen (ext-TIN), peat KCl-extractable nitrate (ext-NO3 (-)), and water-extractable ortho-phosphorus (ext-PO4 (3-)) concentrations and net phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) mineralization and nitrification rates at natural (control) and drained microforms (hummocks, lawns) of a bog and poor fen near Qu,bec City, Canada. Drainage (water table drawdown) decreased net nitrification rates across the landscape and increased ext-NO3 (-) concentrations, but did not affect net N and P mineralization rates or ext-TIN and ext-PO4 (3-) concentrations. We suggest that the thick capillary fringe at the drained peatland likely maintained sufficient moisture above the water table to limit the effects of drainage on microbial activity, and a 20 cm lowering of the water table does not appear to have been sufficient to create a clear difference in nutrient dynamics in this peatland landscape. We found some evidence of differences in nutrient concentrations with microforms, where concentrations were greater in lawn than hummock microforms at control sites indicating some translocation of nutrients. In general, the same microtopographic differences were not observed at drained sites. The general spatial patterns in nutrient concentrations did not reflect net mineralization/immobilization rates measured at our control or drained peatlands. Rather, the spatial patterns in nutrient availability may be regulated by differences in vegetation (mainly Sphagnum moss) cover between control and drained sites and possibly differences in hydrologic connection between microforms. Our results suggest that microform distribution and composition within a peatland may be important for determining how peatland nutrient dynamics will respond to water table drawdown in northern peatlands, as some evidence of microtopographic differences in nutrient dynamics was found.

   FROM PALEOECOLOGICAL DATA
SO JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE PEATLAND DEVELOPMENT; PATTERNED FEN; NORTHERN SCOTLAND; MACROFOSSILS;
   POLLEN
AB The recent discovery and description of patterned fens in Scotland has raised questions about their origins and development.  A series of possible developmental models has been derived which are tested using data from a well-developed site in Sutherland, northern Scotland.  The site morphology indicates that the fen has developed over a more complex subpeat topography and that the present-day features are unrelated to the original mineral surface.  Stratigraphical information together with radiocarbon dates and pollen age estimates suggest that the mire developed initially in one, perhaps two, narrow gullies as poor fen peats from the early tenth millenium BP.  The mire then spread on to surrounding slopes with the onset of ombrotrophic peat accumulation, where the most recent basal age estimate is ca. 3500 yr BP.  Poor fen peats extending to the surface began growth at ca. 2850 yr BP, once this ombrotrophic peat cover was complete.  A reconstruction of mire conditions based on macrofossil, pollen and other microfossils shows the nature and timing of these changes in more detail.  The findings show that the existing models of patterned fen development are not applicable to the Scottish systems.  Instead, the poor fen systems are recent developments, which may overlie extensive earlier peat deposits of ombrotrophic character, and are unrelated to earlier peat development.  The site has probably developed as a result of localised hydrological changes within the underlying peat body and mineral base, resulting in increased volume and quality of the water supply.  It is suggested that this may be by the development and emergence of sub-peat pipes at the head of a suitable slope.

AB Peatlands accumulate organic matter as peat because of disproportionate rates of production and decomposition. However, peat accumulation heterogeneity has not been well studied along the microtopographic gradient (hummocks vs. hollows), particularly with respect to fire. Fire affects peatland species composition by differentially removing vegetation and resetting succession, resulting in peat accumulation changes. We examined peat accumulation and microtopography in two historically burned bogs in Alberta, Canada. Measurements of current and historic microtopography were made, and cores were collected along the gradient to identify depth of peat accumulated since fire, as well as to assess properties of the accumulated peat. Current microtopography is significant and correlated with the immediate postfire surface relief. However, differences in the magnitude of variability between sites suggests that differential rates of growth between features are exacerbated between sites and reflected in bog microtopography. Rates of organic matter accumulation, ranging from 156 to 257 g(.)m(-2.)year(-1), were elevated but comparable to published rates of recent accumulation. Organic matter content and accumulation rate were greater for hummocks than hollows at Athabasca bog, but the difference between features diminished at Sinkhole Lake, suggesting that the pattern and properties of peat accumulation and microtopography postfire may be attributable to differences in site conditions.

AB Grime's model of plant species richness was used as a basis for examining how local and regional processes interact in the regulation of the species richness of vascular plants growing on individual Carer stricta (tussock sedge) tussocks in New Hampshire, USA. We first used a correlational study of 71 tussocks in five marshes to examine the relationships between species richness and standing crop + leaf litter biomass. We found humped (unimodal) relationships with a wide variation in peak species richness per tussock among sites. Then, using a factorial design involving 167 tussocks in three marshes, we performed Carer stricta standing crop removals, leaf litter removals, and seed additions to examine how these factors interacted to influence species richness. The results of both studies supported Grime's model, which implies that the magnitude of local competitive effects on plant species richness is dependent on regional propagule availability.

AB Species in the genus Sphagnum create, maintain, and dominate boreal peatlands through 'extended phenotypes' that allow these organisms to engineer peatland ecosystems and thereby impact global biogeochemical cycles. One such phenotype is the production of peat, or incompletely decomposed biomass, that accumulates when rates of growth exceed decomposition. Interspecific variation in peat production is thought to be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of ecological gradients such as the microtopographic hummock-hollow gradient, along which sympatric species sort within communities. This study investigated the mode and tempo of functional trait evolution across 15 species of Sphagnum using data from the most extensive studies of Sphagnum functional traits to date and phylogenetic comparative methods. We found evidence for phylogenetic conservatism of the niche descriptor height-above-water-table and of traits related to growth, decay and litter quality. However, we failed to detect the influence of phylogeny on interspecific variation in other traits such as shoot density and suggest that environmental context can obscure phylogenetic signal. Trait correlations indicate possible adaptive syndromes that may relate to niche and its construction. This study is the first to formally test the extent to which functional trait variation among Sphagnum species is a result of shared evolutionary history.

AB The dynamics of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degradation in Sphagnum litters and the decomposition of the litters were investigated. PAH concentration decreased to approximately half of the initial concentration as Sphagnum litters decayed. The initial PAH concentration was 489.2 +/- 72.2 ng g(-1), and the concentration after 120 days of incubation was 233.0 +/- 5.8 ng g(-1). The different PAH compositions changed concentrations at different times. The low-molecular-weight (LMW) and high-molecular-weight (HMW) PAHs started to be degraded after incubation and after 40 days of incubation, respectively. PAH concentrations in the Sphagnum litters correlated with the total organic carbon (TOC) content (p < 0.05), indicating that PAHs were associated with the TOC of the Sphagnum litters and were degraded as organic matter decayed. The positive relationship between LMW PAH concentration and the soluble carbohydrate content (p < 0.05) indicated that LMW PAHs and the readily decomposed organic carbon fractions were cometabolized, or that LMW PAHs were mainly absorbed by soluble carbohydrate. The weak negative correlation between fulvic acid (FA) and PAH concentrations (p < 0.1) indicated that FA may enhance PAH degradation. Redundancy analysis suggested that the contents of both soluble carbohydrate and cellulose significantly affected the changes in PAH concentrations (p < 0.05), and that FA content and C/N ratios may also contribute to the changes in PAH concentrations (p < 0.1). However, the polyphenol that was related to microbial activities was not associated with changes in PAH concentrations. These results suggested that litter quality is more important than microbial activities in PAH degradation in Sphagnum litters.

AB Peat carbon accumulation is controlled by both large scale factors, such as climate and hydrological setting, and small scale factors, such as microtopography and plant community. These small scale factors commonly vary within peatlands and can cause variation in biogeochemical traits and carbon accumulation within the same site. To understand these within-site variations, we investigated long term carbon accumulation, peat decomposition, biogeochemistry of pore water and plant macrofossils along a transect in an ombrotrophic bog in southern Patagonia. An additional question we addressed is how historical deposition of volcanic ash on the peatland has affected its carbon balance.
   Variability in plant community and water table led to differences in long term peat and carbon accumulation (peat moss > cushion plant), organic matter decomposition (cushion plant > peat moss), and methane production (peat moss > cushion plant). Macrofossil analysis and radiocarbon dating indicated a relationship between plant community and carbon accumulation or decomposition during the historical succession of vegetation in the peatland. C/N ratio and isotopic signatures reflected variability in plant community as litter source, and DOC concentrations were controlled by humification level. Volcanic ash deposition had only limited effect on plant composition, but it was associated with increased decomposition in overlying peat layers. This study highlights the importance of understanding how plant communities develop, as changes in communities could significantly affect the potential of ombrotrophic peatlands as C sink.

AB Fluxes of methane were measured by a static chamber technique at hummock, hollow, and lawn microtopographic locations in 12 peatland sites near Cochrane, northern Ontario, from May to October 1991. Average fluxes (mg . m-2 . d-1) were 2.3 (SD = 1.9) at hummocks, 44.4 (SD = 49.0) at hollows, and 15.6 (SD = 12.9) at lawns. Methane flux was negatively correlated with average water table position based on the 36 locations (r2 = 0.649, p < 0.001), with hummocks having a smaller flux than hollows or lawns, where the water table depth was < 25 cm. Peat samples from a bog hummock and hollow failed to produce methane during anaerobic incubations in the laboratory; samples from a poor fen hollow produced < 1.4 mug . g-1 . d-1. The production decreased with depth but was greater than the rates observed during the incubation of samples from an adjacent hummock. Rates of methane consumption during aerobic incubations ranged from 1 to 55 mug . g-1 . d-1 and were greatest in the surface layers and decreased with depth. Differences in methane emissions between hummocks and hollows appear to be controlled primarily by greater methane production rates in hollows compared with hummocks. Of secondary importance are the capacity of the peat profiles to consume methane during its transport to the peat surface and warmer temperatures at the water table beneath hollows compared with hummocks.

AB This study is based on releves from 96 peatlands representing the typologic, environmental, and geographic variation of Maine peatlands, and on peat pore-water chemistry at a representative set of 51 of these peatlands. We give optima and tolerances of pH, Ca, P, NO3-N, NH4-N, and influence of upper on lower vegetational strata for the 73 most common vascular plant species, excluding sedges, which are presented elsewhere. The program TWINSPAN differentiated 30 plant communities. Environments of the first seven TWINSPAN divisions differed largely by Ca, pH, P, NH4, Fe, microrelief, substrate depth, degree of humification, and climate. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with forward selection entered pH, P, Na, Fe, Ca, Mg, and percent H2O as the minimum number of variables which best explains species variation. A CCA of the lower strata vascular plants demonstrated the importance of the upper strata (percent overstory) on species' distributions. Gradients of pH-alkalinity and percent overstory are primary in determining Maine's peatland vegetation. Other important gradients are percent H2O in upper peat, concentrations of lithic elements (P, Fe, Mn, Al, and Si) in pore water, and climate. Although these gradients partially covary, some of the variation in species' distributions can be attributed to independent aspects of individual gradients. Species richness across the range of peatland types is related to pH-alkalinity for vascular plants, and to percent H2O, microrelief, and percent overstory for bryophytes.

AB Peatlands could become important foraging habitats, and their plant communities threatened, in areas with an overabundance of large herbivores. Peatland response to herbivore exclusion may vary widely according to abiotic conditions and associated species because of a strong minerotrophic gradient. We assessed the impact of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimm.) on peatland vegetation using an exclosure experiment. A total of 53 pairs of exclosures and unprotected plots were set up in bogs (13 pairs), sedge fens (20), shrub fens (7), and laggs (13), and surveyed prior to exclosure construction as well as three, five, and eight years after. Vascular plant composition of exclosures diverged from that of unprotected plots through time only in shrub fens and laggs. Bryophytes remained constant in all habitats. On average, shrub cover was 30% higher in exclosures in all habitats after five years, whereas herb cover increased only in laggs, by 43%, after eight years. Reclassification of sites by pH showed deer exclusion promoted alpha diversity in low-and high-moderate rich fens (pH 5.3-6.8) and beta diversity in the latter as well as in rich fens (pH 6.3-7.5). Overall, our results suggest that conservation efforts in areas with overabundant large herbivores should target richer peatland habitats since they showed a higher resilience and fostered alpha and beta diversity.

AB Forested peatlands are widespread in boreal regions of Canada, and these ecosystems, which are major terrestrial carbon sinks, are undergoing significant transformations linked to climate change, fires and human activities. This study targets millennial-scale vegetation dynamics and related hydrological variability in forested peatlands of the Clay Belt south of James Bay, eastern Canada, using palaeoecological data. Changes in peatland vegetation communities were reconstructed using plant macrofossil analyses, and variations in water-table depths were inferred using testate amoeba analyses. High-resolution analyses of macroscopic charcoal >0.5 mm were used to reconstruct local fire history. Our data showed two successional pathways towards the development of present-day forested peatlands influenced by autogenic processes such as vertical peat growth and related drying, and allogenic factors such as the occurrence of local fires. The oldest documented peatland initiated in a wet rich fen around 8000 cal. a BP shortly after land emergence and transformed into a drier forested bog rapidly after peat inception that persisted over millennia. In the second site, peat started to accumulate from similar to 5200 cal. a BP over a mesic coniferous forest that shifted into a wet forested peatland following a fire that partially consumed the organic layer similar to 4600 cal. a BP. The charcoal records show that fires rarely occurred in these peatlands, but they have favoured the process of forest paludification and influenced successional trajectories over millennia. The macrofossil data suggest that Picea mariana (black spruce) persisted on the peatlands throughout their development, although there were periods of more open canopy due to local fires in some cases. This study brings new understanding on the natural variability of boreal forested peatlands which may help predict their response to future changes in climate, fire regimes and anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Peatlands store large amounts of organic carbon, but the carbon stock is sensitive to changes in precipitation or water table manipulations. Restoration of drained peatlands by drain blocking and flooding is a common measure to conserve and augment the carbon stock of peatland soils. Here, we report to what extent flooding affected the contribution of heterotrophic and rhizosphere respiration to soil CO2 efflux in a grass-dominated mountain fen in Germany. Soil CO2 efflux was measured in three un-manipulated control plots and three flooded plots in two consecutive years. Flooding was achieved by permanent irrigation during the growing seasons. Radiocarbon signatures of CO2 from different sources including soil CO2 efflux, incubated peat cores and live grass roots were repeatedly analyzed for partitioning of soil CO2 efflux. Additionally, heterotrophic respiration and its radiocarbon signature were determined by eliminating rhizosphere respiration in trenched subplots (only control). In the control plots, rhizosphere respiration determined by C-14 signatures contributed between 47 and 61% during the growing season, but was small (4 +/- 8%) immediately before budding. Trenching revealed a smaller rhizosphere contribution of 33 +/- 8% (2009) and 22 +/- 9% (2010) during growing seasons.
   Flooding reduced annual soil CO2 efflux of the fen by 42% in 2009 and by 30% in 2010. The reduction was smaller in 2010 mainly through naturally elevated water level in the control plots. A one-week interruption of irrigation caused a strong short-lived increase in soil CO2 efflux, demonstrating the sensitivity of the fen to water table drawdown near the peat surface. The reduction in soil CO2 efflux in the flooded plots diminished the relative proportion of rhizosphere respiration from 56 to 46%, suggesting that rhizosphere respiration was slightly more sensitive to flooding than heterotrophic respiration.

AB The aims of the study were: (1) to investigate the modern distribution pattern of snails in the Western Carpathians (Czech Republic and Slovakia) and compare it with the modern distribution pattern of plants, in which a conspicuous Species turnover o(curs on the scale of only tens of kilometres; and (2) to construct an hypothesis explaining why such a steep geographical gradient exists in such a small area, which is homogenous with respect to water chemistry and climate. Snail assemblages of 111 treeless base-rich spring-fen sites were sampled quantitatively from a homogeneous area of 16 in 2 (one sample of 121 volume) in which a vegetation releve was also recorded. The result of a partial detrended correspondence analysis of snail data with water pH and conductivity as co-variables confirmed clear differences between snail assemblages of the study area's western and eastern region. The regions differed in their species pool and the frequencies of particular species. In the castern region, fen specialists and relics occurred and they were fairly frequent and abundant (e.g. Vertigo geyeri and Papilla alpicola). The western region differed by its higher frequency and abundance of woodland and ubiquitous species. The classification of snail species based on their co-occurrence with plant species reflected the known geographical pattern as well. We found that Western Carpathian fen vegetation as well as the fens' snail assemblages display a clear geographical gradient within a rather small area, independently of any climate or ir her environmental variation. Previously published palaeoecological data and both species composition and structure of modern assemblages suggest clear differences in the historical development of the two principal regions. Historical development seems to be one of the most important variables constituting qualitative characters of modern fragmented communities. Oil a small scale it can influence especially orgarnisms with slower migration rates, Such as molluscs.

AB This paper reports the results of plant-macrofossil investigations from a peat layer buried within coastal alluvium at the Caburn, a site adjacent to the English chalkland. The data collected are compared against a published mid-Holocene pollen sequence with the macrofossil record providing greater taxonomic resolution and establishing a local presence for many taxa. Alnus glutinosa pollen is abundant and Alnus macrofossils are recorded continuously over a c. 3000 cal year period. Fluctuations in the number of Alnus propagules and the presence of seeds of light-demanding herbaceous plants suggest that regeneration occurred at a local scale, a process which is likely to have been promoted by a rising water table and sediment consolidation. Taxus baccata macrofossils were also recovered, indicating that the high pollen values previously reported may be the result of yew being present within the wetland area. The Tilia macrofossils establish the presence nearby of T. cordata, T. x europaea and T. platyphyllos. High pollen values for Quercus, Tilia and Alnus coincide with the occurrence of their anthers. Deposition within inflorescences is therefore likely to have been an important mode of pollen delivery. The usefulness of both techniques in studies that utilize peats derived from fen carr vegetation are discussed. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

SO GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ORGANIC-MATTER; CLIMATE
AB Recent advances in the precision and accuracy of the optical techniques required to measure luminescence permit the nondestructive analysis of solid geologic samples such as speleothems (secondary carbonate deposits in caves). In this paper we show that measurement of speleothem luminescence demonstrates a strong relationship between the excitation and emission wavelengths and both the extent of soil humification and mean annual rainfall. Raw peat with blanket bog vegetation has the highest humification and highest luminescence excitation and emission matrix wavelengths, because of the higher proportion of high-molecular-weight organic acids in these soils. Brown ranker and rendzina soils,vith dry grassland and woodland cover have the lowest wavelengths. Detailed analysis of one site where an annually laminated stalagmite has been deposited over the past 70 yr during a period with instrumental climate records and no vegetation change suggests that more subtle variations in luminescence emission wavelength correlate best with mean annual rainfall, although there is a lag of similar to 10 yr. These results are used to interpret soil humification and climate change from a 130 ka speleothem at an upland site in Yorkshire, England. These data provide a new continuous terrestrial record of climate and environmental change for northwestern Europe and suggest the presence of significant variations in wetness and vegetation within interglacial and interstadial periods.

AB Two controlled experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential for vascular plants to germinate and establish in milled peatlands and to assess whether easily measured plant traits can be used to predict their probable success. Study species included twenty species of perennial herbs, shrubs and trees occurring frequently in undisturbed bogs or abandoned milled bogs in Quebec, Canada. First, a glasshouse experiment was performed to test the effect of burial under peat on germination and seedling emergence. Second, a growth chamber experiment was conducted to measure relative growth rate and other growth parameters of seedlings between 1 and 3 weeks of age. In the burial experiment, seedling emergence decreased exponentially with peat depth for most species examined. The slope of the exponential decline varied between species and was strongly correlated to seed mass. Seeds less than 0.1 mg in mass were most sensitive to burial. In the seedling growth experiments, Betula species had the highest absolute and relative growth rates, which may help to explain their prevalence in milled bogs. Relative growth rate (RGR) was not correlated with seed mass, however it was strongly correlated with leaf area ratio (LAR) and especially specific leaf area (SLA) of seedlings, except for species with seed mass less than 0.01 mg. Screening of species for seed mass and SLA should help predict their germination and establishment success or failure in milled peatlands and allow more directed interventions to favour the establishment of desirable species in milled bogs.

AB This study seeks to investigate the role of Calluna vulgaris canopy height in the CO2 balance of ombrotrophic peatlands to address what implications this relationship may have for management of these peatlands for maximal carbon storage. This study uses a monthly dataset of CO2 flux and associated environmental variables gathered from three localities in the South Pennines and the Peak District National Park of northern England between 2007 and 2010, covering a range of C. vulgaris canopy heights. It was found that both gross fluxes of CO2 (ecosystem respiration and photosynthesis) were modelled best by models incorporating a dependence on canopy height. Ecosystem respiration was positively correlated and photosynthesis was negatively correlated to canopy height. It was found that as canopy height increases, the amount of photosynthesis per unit respiration decreased and thus that net ecosystem exchange became more positive. Despite the relationship between the gross fluxes and canopy height, models of net ecosystem exchange suggested that there was no canopy height at which blanket peat dominated by C. vulgaris would be a net annual sink of CO2. This was due to the relatively deep water tables at the sites which served to enhance ecosystem respiration. Looking at the dataset as a whole, for a 10 cm increase in canopy height there was a median increase of 0.829 +/- 0.583 g CO2 m(2) d(-1) in net CO2 flux, with considerable seasonal variation. Managers interested in minimising CO2 losses from blanket peat should note that C. vulgaris on blanket peat in the areas studied is predicted to be a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere for all canopy heights. As such, vegetation management away from C. vulgaris dominance is recommended to improve the functioning of these bogs. If vegetation management away from heather on climatically marginal blanket peat is infeasible then managers should avoid taller canopies, where day time photosynthesis is almost always less than day time respiration.

AB Wetlands represent a substantial part of Manitoba's terrestrial landscape, covering 233,340 km(2) or 43% of the province; peatlands represent 90% of all wetlands. A wetland inventory for Manitoba is presented following a classification scheme grounded in wetland function, vegetation, and landform. The province is subdivided into twelve wetland regions each having distinctive wetland types and abundances. A hybrid Detrended Canonical Correspondance Analysis (DCCA) indicates that wetland distribution in the province is largely controlled by allogenic factors of climate and physiography. The first canonical axis represents the variance in wetland distribution occurring along a north-to-south gradient within the province. In northern Manitoba, permafrost bogs dominate, replaced southwards by bogs without permafrost and fens with and without internal lawns. Farther south, peatlands are replaced by non-peat-accumulating wetlands. This wetland distributional gradient is most strongly correlated to mean annual temperature, with thermal seasonal aridity, annual precipitation, and moisture deficit (precipitation-potential evaporation) also significant. Significant allogenic variables correlated to the first canonical axis are not restricted to climate alone. The type of bedrock geology in the area also plays an important role in determining wetland distribution, with bogs occurring preferentially in areas of acidic bedrock, while fens are found on calcareous bedrock. The second canonical axis represents a surface-water flow gradient, with patterned fens and marshes having relatively large amounts of surface-water flow on one end and nonpermafrost bogs and swamps with low amounts of surface-water flow on the other. Texture of the subsurface is the most important variable explaining the second axis, with sediments having high hydraulic conductivity correlated to wetlands with high surface-water flow, while sediments with low hydraulic conductivity are related to wetlands with low surface-water how. Annual precipitation is also a statistically significant variable explaining the variance in wetland distribution along the second axis.

AB To assess the effect of the invasion of vascular plants on the heat and water balance in a Sphagnum bog, evapotranspiration was compared throughout a growing season in the Sphagnum bog and in the adjoining transition peatland where vascular plants completely cover the ground surface in the Sarobetsu mire, northern Japan. Cumulative evapotranspiration over 152 days was 372 mm in the transition peatland and 285 mm in the bog, with the differences between the sites becoming clear from mid-August. Therefore, we consider the invasion of the vascular plants into the Sphagnum bog to accelerate water consumption. However, levels of evapotranspiration in mid-summer did not differ greatly between the sites. In mid-summer, the ratio of latent heat flux to net radiation decreased in the transition peatland on days when humidity deficit was large, although, in the bog, the ratio showed a large value in those days. We attribute the decrease in the ratio to stomatal closure with the increase in humidity deficit. We also conclude that the invading vascular plants developed a negative feedback mechanism of stomatal response to the humidity deficit of the ambient air in mid-summer.

AB Question: How can long-term monitoring of hydrological and ecological parameters support management strategies aimed towards wetland restoration and re-creation in a complex hydrological system?
   Location: Newham Bog National Nature Reserve, Northumberland, UK, a site with a long history of active management, and recorded as drought-sensitive over the last 100 years.
   Methods: Water level readings are correlated with longer-term hydrological databases, and these data related to vegetation data collected intermittently over a 12 year period. Two analyses are undertaken: (1) a composite DCA analysis of 1993 and 2002 survey data to assess plant community transitions within the wetland and over time, and (2) analysis of recent vegetation data to explore wider vegetation gradients. This allows (3) communities to be classified using NVC classes and (4) integrated with revised Ellenberg F-values.
   Results: Drought impact and subsequent hydrological recovery over a 22-year period are quantified. Vegetation data display strong moisture and successional gradients. Analysis shows a shift from grassland communities toward mire communities across much of the site.
   Conclusion: The site is regionally unique in that it has a detailed long-term monitoring record. Hydrological data and vegetation survey have allowed the impact of the most recent 'groundwater' drought (1989-1997) to be quantified. This information on system resilience, combined with eco-hydrological analyses of plant community-water regime/quality relationships, provide a basis for recommendations concerning conservation and restoration.

AB We measured seasonal patterns of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 in a diverse peatland complex underlain by discontinuous permafrost in northern Manitoba, Canada, as part of the Boreal Ecosystems Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). Study sites spanned the full range of peatland trophic and moisture gradients found in boreal environments from bog (pH 3.9) to rich fen (pH 7.2). During midseason (July-August, 1996), highest fates of NEE and respiration followed the trophic sequence of bog (5.4 to -3.9 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) < poor fen (6.3 to -6.5 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) < intermediate fen (10.5 to -7.8 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) < rich fen (14.9 to -8.7 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). The sequence changed during spring (May-June) and fall (September-October) when ericaceous shrub (e.g., Chamaedaphne calyculata) bogs and sedge (Carex spp.) communities in poor to intermediate fens had higher maximum CO2 fixation rates than deciduous shrub-dominated (Salix spp. and Betula spp.) rich fens. Timing of snowmelt and differential rates of peat surface thaw in microtopographic hummocks and hollows controlled the onset of carbon uptake in spring. Maximum photosynthesis and respiration were closely correlated throughout the growing season with a ratio of approximately 1/3 ecosystem respiration to maximum carbon uptake at all sites across the trophic gradient. Soil temperatures above the water table and timing of surface thaw and Freeze-up in the spring and fall were more important to net CO2 exchange than deep soil warming. This close coupling of maximum CO2 uptake and respiration to easily measurable variables, such as trophic status, peat temperature, and water table, will improve models of wetland carbon exchange. Although trophic status, aboveground net primary productivity, and surface temperatures were more important than water level in predicting respiration on a daily basis, the mean position of the water table was a good predictor (r(2) = 0.63) of mean respiration rates across the range of plant community and moisture gradients. Q(10) values ranged from 3.0 to 4.1 from bog to rich fen, but when normalized by above ground vascular plant biomass, the Q(10) for all sites was 3.3.

AB We examined the relative importance of exogenous (pH, water table, soil nutrient and cation availability) and endogenous (carbon quality, nutrient and cation concentrations of litter) controls on litter decay over both the short term (1 yr) and intermediate term (3 yr) in four freshwater peatland communities that occur along a P and N availability gradient in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. Four litter types were reciprocally transplanted into each community. Additionally, the effects of exogenous nutrient availability and low pH on decomposition dynamics were examined by fertilizing and liming plots in the most nutrient-deficient community, the short pocosin. Both exogenous and endogenous factors were important in controlling decay rates and nutrient mineralization-immobilization dynamics. The most important site factor controlling decay rates was water table, with greater rates of decomposition in drained sites. High initial soluble phenolic concentrations and a low holocellulose quotient (% holocellulose / % lignocellulose) in litter inhibited decay rates. Despite the extremely low nutrient availability in the pocosins and low soil pH in all three communities, both the cross-community comparison and the amendment experiment in the short pocosin demonstrated that exogenous nutrient availability, endogenous nutrient concentrations in litter, and low soil pH do not inhibit decomposition in these sites. In contrast, immobilization-mineralization dynamics of N and P were largely driven by a source-sink relationship, with greatest immobilization found with high exogenous nutrient availability and low initial endogenous nutrient concentrations. We suggest a conceptual model of nutrient control over decomposition as a function of carbon quality of litter.

AB Peatland surface patterning motivates studies that identify underlying structuring mechanisms. Theoretical studies so far suggest that different mechanisms may drive similar types of patterning. The long time span associated with peatland surface pattern formation, however, limits possibilities for empirically testing model predictions by field manipulations. Here, we present a model that describes spatial interactions between vegetation, nutrients, hydrology, and peat. We used this model to study pattern formation as driven by three different mechanisms: peat accumulation, water ponding, and nutrient accumulation. By on-and-off switching of each mechanism, we created a full-factorial design to see how these mechanisms affected surface patterning (pattern of vegetation and peat height) and underlying patterns in nutrients and hydrology. Results revealed that different combinations of structuring mechanisms lead to similar types of peatland surface patterning but contrasting underlying patterns in nutrients and hydrology. These contrasting underlying patterns suggest that the presence or absence of the structuring mechanisms can be identified by relatively simple short-term field measurements of nutrients and hydrology, meaning that longer-term field manipulations can be circumvented. Therefore, this study provides promising avenues for future empirical studies on peatland patterning.

AB In this study, we reconstructed the long-term fire history of a set of ombrotrophic peatlands (bogs) located in a temperate region of southern Quebec (Bas-Saint-Laurent). Past and recent fire-free intervals (time interval between two consecutive fires) were compared using macrofossil analyses. During most of the Holocene epoch, fires were relatively rare events in bogs of the Bas-Saint-Laurent region. The fire-free intervals were approximately ten times longer (all sites considered) before the beginning of agricultural activities in the region (1800 AD) than after. This strongly suggests an anthropogenic influence on the fire regime prevailing in the bogs over the last 200 years. However, the shortening of the fire-free intervals was mainly the result of the ignition of one or two fires in almost every site during a relatively short period (200 years), rather than a higher fire frequency in each of the bogs. In some cases, fires had an influence on the vegetation structure of bogs, but it is more likely that a combination of several disturbances (fire, drainage, and drier than average summers) favoured the establishment of dense stands of pine and spruce, a forest expansion phenomenon that is now widespread in temperate bogs.

AB This study presents the results of an investigation of drainage effects of the Romeriksporten railway tunnel on peatlands in the Lake Northern Puttjern area. Drainage impacts on peatlands occurred in marked depressions reflecting faults or weakness zones in bedrocks. The impacts were most evident near the tunnel trace, but dry peatlands and streams were observed as far as 600 m from the tunnel trace. Several types of drainage effects were observed on peatland surfaces after tunnelling; surface subsidence and formation of local depressions, peat slides, peat cracking, dry peat holes, and death of vegetation. The effects depended clearly on peatland properties. The greatest and most damaging effects were associated with thick peat layers around open water surface. Here lowering of the water table caused peat slides. Such areas will generally be extremely vulnerable to lowering of the water level. The magnitude of subsidence of peatlands depends on peat thickness, peat decomposition and groundwater lowering. Even after seven years with artificial infiltration in bedrock wells in dry periods to counteract water table lowering, peat subsidence and peat slides were evident, demonstrating that temporary draw down of water can result in irreversible impacts on peatlands. To better be able to avoid damaging effects of tunnel drainage on environment, investigations of properties of peatlands above possible tunnel traces should be integrated in the planning procedure for tunnel constructions. In mires above such traces, the occurrence of floating peat mats, degree of peat decomposition, peat thickness, deliveries of water from surrounding catchments in dry periods and possible pathways of leakage through subsoils and bedrocks should be examined as basis for assessment of vulnerability of peatlands to tunnel drainage and selection of tunnel traces that evade the most vulnerable peatlands. When such areas can not be avoided, requirements should be set to the tightening of the tunnel to prevent damaging water draw downs in dry periods. Observations of drainage effects on peatland surfaces can complement hydrological information from measurements of tunnel leakages and groundwater levels and thus contribute to provide a broader picture of hydrological impacts and bedrock hydrogeology.

AB The response of peatland carbon accumulation to climate can be complex, with internal feedbacks and processes that can dampen or amplify responses to external forcing. Records of carbon accumulation from peat cores provide a record of carbon which persists as peat over long periods of time, demonstrating the long-term response of peatland carbon stocks to climatic events. Numerous records of long-term carbon accumulation exist globally. However, peatlands from oceanic climates, and particularly blanket bog, remain under-represented. Scottish bogs, which collectively have more than 475 separate palaeoecological records, may prove to be a valuable resource for studying the impact of environmental change on past rates of carbon accumulation. Here we present 12 records of carbon accumulation from the north of Scotland. We support these results with a further 43 records where potential carbon accumulation is inferred from published ages. These reveal a trend of high carbon accumulation in the early Holocene, declining in the mid-to-late Holocene. The trend is consistent with accumulation profiles from other northern peatlands and is likely to have been caused by climatic cooling. Considerable variability in carbon accumulation rates between locations is apparent for the mid-to-late Holocene. We attribute to hydrologically induced changes in carbon accumulation which are likely to be inconsistent between sites.

AB In the Athabasca oil sands region near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, peatlands are disturbed extensively in order to recover bitumen below the surface. Hence, following oil sands mining, landscape reclamation is a part of the mine closure process in order to return functioning ecosystems, including peatlands, to the region. This study was conducted at a pilot fen reclamation project and three other diverse natural (poor, rich and saline) fens in the oil sands region during the growing seasons of 2013 and 2014, the first and second year post-construction. Ecosystem functioning of the constructed fen (CF) was evaluated with reference to natural fens based on pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and chemistry. Significant variation of DOC concentration among the reference fens was observed, varying from an average of 42.0 mg/L at the rich fen (RF) to 70.8 mg/L at the saline fen (SF). Dissolved organic carbon concentration at CF was significantly lower than at all reference fens, but increased significantly over the first two years. Seasonal variation of DOC concentration was also observed in each site with concentration increasing over the growing season. At CF, DOC was comprised of larger, more humic and complex aromatic compounds than reference fens in the first year post-construction based on its spectrophotometric properties; however, these differences were reduced in the second year. Initial DOC concentration and chemistry at CF was indicative of the source being largely the peat placed during fen construction. Changes in chemistry and increasing concentration of DOC in the second growing season likely resulted from increasing inputs from plants established on site. These results suggest that DOC concentration is likely to increase in future at CF as vascular plant productivity increases and in response to salinity sourced from tailing sand used to construct the catchment.

AB Calcareous fens are wetlands fed by calcareous groundwater and with predominantly low (< 1 m) vegetation. They are critical habitat for rare species, and development of tall vegetation alters this habitat. Our purpose was to better understand how human activities influence the fen habitat. In 1997 in eastern New York and northwestern Connecticut we located 25 fens using soil maps and field surveys, and delimited these sites using 73 indicator plants classified a priori as fen species, disturbance species, or non-fen woody species. In three plots in each fen we measured species cover, water table depth, organic matter, total inorganic nitrogen, groundwater pH and conductivity, and described land use on and within 100 m of each fen to identify the conditions that may lead to fen degradation. Total inorganic nitrogen correlated most significantly with plant species composition. Fen-species richness was negatively correlated with nitrogen, whereas non-fen woody species richness and cover were positively correlated with nitrogen, suggesting that nitrogen inputs contribute to dominance of tall vegetation in fens. Richness of disturbance indicator species was negatively correlated with soil organic matter. Thus, fens with mineral soil layers may be more susceptible to dominance by non-fen species. Percent cover of disturbance indicator species was greater in fens near public roads. Cover of Lythrum salicaria, an invasive weed, was positively correlated with land-use intensity and was greater near public roads. The use of soil maps, indicator plant richness and cover, inorganic nitrogen, water table, and soil organic matter may be an efficient method for locating, delimiting, and assessing the ecological status of fens.

AB The hydraulic conductivity (K) of peat beneath the water table varies over short (annual) periods. Biogenic gas bubbles block pores and reduce K, and seasonal changes in the water table position cause peat deformation, altering peat pore size distribution. Although it has been hypothesized that both processes reduce K during warm dry summer conditions, temporal variations in K under field conditions have been explained previously by peat volume changes (strain) alone. We determine the effect of both controls on K by monitoring changes in gas content (), strain and K within a poor fen. Over the growing season, K decreased by an order of magnitude. In the near-surface peat (0.3-0.7m), this reduction is more strongly correlated with , providing the first field-based evidence that biogenic gas bubbles reduce K. In the deeper peat (0.7-1.3m), K is correlated principally with strain. However, causality is uncertain because of multicollinearity between strain and . To mitigate for multicollinearity, we took advantage of a peatland drainage experiment where the water table was artificially dropped at the beginning of the growing season, reducing correlations between strain and . remained the primary cause of K variations just beneath the water table at a depth of 0.5-0.7m, although further down through the peat profile (0.7-1.2m) changes in K were controlled by strain. We suggest that the larger pore structure of the poorly decomposed peat just below the water table is impacted less by volume changes than that of the more decomposed peat at depth. However, within this poorly decomposed peat, K is reduced by the high gas contents that result from higher rates of methane production. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Water resources and associated ecosystems are becoming highly endangered due to ongoing global environmental changes. Spatial ecological modelling is a promising toolbox for understanding the past, present and future distribution and diversity patterns in groundwater-dependent ecosystems, such as fens, springs, streams, reed beds or wet grasslands. Still, the lack of detailed water chemistry maps prevents the use of reasonable models to be applied on continental and global scales. Being major determinants of biological composition and diversity of groundwater-dependent ecosystems, groundwater pH and calcium are of utmost importance. Here we developed an up-to-date European map of groundwater pH and Ca, based on 7577 measurements of near-surface groundwater pH and calcium distributed across Europe. In comparison to the existing European groundwater maps, we included several times more sites, especially in the regions rich in spring and fen habitats, and filled the apparent gaps in eastern and southeastern Europe. We used random forest models and regression kriging to create continuous maps of water pH and calcium at the continental scale, which is freely available also as a raster map (Hajek et al., 2020b; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4139912). Lithology had a higher importance than climate for both pH and calcium. The previously recognised latitudinal and altitudinal gradients were rediscovered with much refined regional patterns, as associated with bedrock variation. For ecological models of distribution and diversity of many terrestrial ecosystems, our new map based on field groundwater measurements is more suitable than maps of soil pH, which mirror not only bedrock chemistry but also vegetation-dependent soil processes.

AB Peat excavation has altered carbon balance in large areas in the Northern Hemisphere and turned peatlands from CO2 sinks to CO2 sources. Peatland restoration aims at mitigating that situation by supporting CO2 uptake in these areas through raising the water table, in this way creating conditions for vegetation development and organic matter accumulation. We analysed the relationships between recovering vegetation and CO2 fluxes on three abandoned peat excavation sites in northern Estonia, which were rewetted and restored using the moss-layer-transfer technique three to ten years before the first measurements. Using chamber measurements, we determined whether these sites were CO2 sinks or sources during two growing seasons in 2015 (drier) and 2016 (wetter). In the drier growing season, all sites were CO2 sources from the peatland to the atmosphere (emissions from 1 to 77 g CO2 m(-2)), while in the wetter growing season, two sites were CO2 sinks (uptake from 13 to 210 g CO2 m(-2)). CO2 uptake was higher with higher plant and Eriophorum vaginatum cover, and biomass and cover of Sphagnum. The remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) explained about 25% of variation in Net Ecosystem Exchange; CO2 uptake was higher in plots with higher NDVI values. This provides a potential avenue of investigation of developing remote sensing methods in assessing spatial pattern of CO2 fluxes in restored peatlands. In order to increase CO2 uptake in abandoned milled peatlands, it is essential to raise the water level and thus reduce peat oxidation and create conditions for the development of vegetation similar to pristine peatlands.

AB A vegetation survey was carried out in a relatively intact Atlantic blanket bog in Southwest Ireland to study the vegetation patterns in relation to environmental variation, and to quantify the effect of artificial and natural borders on compositional variation. The data were analysed using canonical correspondence analysis. In terms of both vegetation and water chemistry, the study site can be categorized as typical of Atlantic blanket bogs in the maritime regions of North-western Europe. The distribution of plant species was explained mainly by depth of the water table. The distribution of bryophytes was secondarily explained by the pH of the bog water, while the distribution of vascular plants was secondarily explained by concentrations of ammonia. The vegetation distribution exhibited little variation between the central sector of the peatland and its disturbed edges (hill-grazing and restoration areas), but a substantial variation was observed between the area along a natural edge (stream) and the areas close to the other peatland borders or centre. Similarly, the internal variation within each sector (centre, hill-grazing edge and restoration area edge) was small, but substantial vegetation variation was observed within the area located along the stream. The area along the stream was associated with relatively deep water table, shallow peat depth, high water colour, pH and NH(4) (+) concentrations, and low Cl(-) concentrations in the bog water. Our results suggest the existence of strong centre-natural margin gradients, as in raised bogs, and indicate that human or animal disturbance do not give rise to the marked transition zones that often characterize natural margins of mire systems. This indicates that even small areas and remnants of Atlantic blanket bogs are worthy of conservation and that their conservation value would benefit from the inclusion of sectors close to the natural peatland borders, which would increase the plant biodiversity of the conserved area.

AB An overview of peatland development and peat formation during the Holocene in Latvia is presented. Altogether, 24 peatlands each with at least three C-14 dates, plant macrofossil data and degree of peat decomposition were assembled in order to compare and discuss spatial and temporal changes. A series of 2000-year time windows for the entire Holocene were produced, showing peatland development processes as reflected by peat composition. The results show that the oldest peatlands started to develop at the beginning of the Early Holocene (11,600-8200 cal. BP), mainly in depressions in the uplands. Peat macrofossil composition is characterised by remains of plants growing under conditions of excess humidity, represented by various Hypnum species and sedges (Carex lasiocarpa, Carex appropinquata and Carex teretiuscula), and less frequently by woody plants. The degree of peat decomposition indicates a wet-dry-wet pattern for the Holocene climate, which accords with other regional climatic studies. Climate change influenced groundwater and lake levels, promoting the establishment of peatlands during the Early Holocene. Warm and dry conditions resulted in low peat accumulation rates throughout the Middle Holocene (8200-4200 cal. BP). The present study shows that a large number of bogs became established in the Late Holocene (4200-0 cal. BP), formed by a wide variety of various raised-bog-type peats (cotton grass-Sphagnum, Sphagnum fuscum and cotton grass peat), which continue to accumulate at the present day. The Early, Middle and Late Holocene as recognised in the present study correspond closely to a recent global scheme suggested by the INTIMATE-SQS working group on the subdivision of the Holocene.

AB Under predicted scenarios of global climate change, peatlands may become a net source of greenhouse gases which will accelerate warming of the atmosphere. Comparative studies of peat bogs along present climatic gradients may provide an insight into the future response of boreal and subarctic peatlands to changing temperature and moisture. Three maritime peat bogs in the British Isles, and two high-elevation peatlands in the Czech Republic were studied. All sites were relatively wet, the mean annual temperatures were higher by up to 6 degrees C at the British/Irish sites than at the Czech sites. Cumulative carbon content in Pb-210-dated Sphagnum-dominated vertical peat cores increased from the warmer to the colder sites when evaluated for the most recent decades (since ca. 1950). That would correspond to formation of thinner, more highly decomposed peat deposits over the long-term in warmer conditions, and deeper peat bogs in colder conditions. However, when cumulative carbon content was evaluated for the last ca. 150 years, no relationship was found between mean annual temperature and the carbon pool size. Even along broad present-day climatic gradients, site-specific factors controlled organic carbon preservation in peat. Pollen analysis was instrumental in corroborating the Pb-210 dates, identifying wet and dry periods in the past, and it also provided evidence for increasing nitrogen loads in wetland areas.

SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SPECIES RICHNESS; VEGETATION
AB The vegetation communities of East Anglian valley head fens are dependent for their water supply upon calcareous spring water. Many of these fen vegetation types are nationally localised, some are rare and all have considerable conservation importance.
   Many of the fens have been detrimentally influenced by drainage, and increasingly abstraction of water from the aquifer threatens their nature conservation importance directly and by exacerbating the effects of climatic drought. Changes have occurred in the species composition of a significant number of sites and in some instances this has resulted in a change in vegetation community type.
   The effect of drainage upon fens is longstanding and whilst this has undoubtedly caused a decrease in nature conservation interest, the spring-dependent communities have often survived. The threat of groundwater abstraction is comparatively more recent and directly threatens the springs themselves and the nationally important vegetation communities associated with them. With the exception of a few cases where intensive hydrological studies have been undertaken, it is difficult to establish the impact of groundwater abstraction upon fen water table levels. In many cases reference is made to past floristic records and the descriptions of fens to provide evidence of dehydration.
   Engineered measures to ameliorate the impact of water loss are often suggested but are seldom ecologically acceptable. The problem of dehydration due to water abstraction needs to be tackled strategically in the long term, though action needs to be taken over currently existing licences. The alleviation of the problem-will be helped if water resource plans accommodate the water demand of those fens with a high wildlife interest.

AB The vegetation within an ombrotrophic mire expanse in SE Norway is studied in detail. Presence/absence of species and depth to the water table are recorded for 6976 plots (4 x 4 cm). The cumulative probability distributions along the water-table gradient are calculated for 24 species, and inter-transect variability tested. Shifts in realised depth to the water table (niche shifts) are frequent for most species. It is concluded that interactions are of minor importance for species in the field layer. The Sphagnum spp. possess some attributes indicating equilibrium, while others indicate ongoing competition. The patchy distribution of hepatics and lichens depend on chance and successional stage, and coexistence within these guilds depend on creation of new naked peat patches.

AB A number of hydrological, botanical, macro- and micro-climatological processes are involved in the formation of patterned peatlands. La Grande Tsa at 2336 m a.s.l. is probably the highest bog in the central Swiss Alps and is unique in its pattern. In two of five pools there is in the contact zone between the basal peat and the overlying gyttja an unconfonnity in the depth-age models based on radiocarbon dates. Palynostratigraphies of cores from a ridge and a pool confirm the occurrence of an unconformity in the contact zone. We conclude that deepening of the pools results from decomposition of peat. The fact that the dated unconformities in the two pools and the unconfonnity in the ridge-core all fall within the Bronze Age suggest they were caused by events external to the bog. We hypothesize that early transhumance resulted in anthropogenic lowering of the timberline, which resulted in a reduction in the leaf-area index and evapotranspiration, and in higher water levels and thus pool formation.

AB Alkaline fens are ecosystems with extraordinarily high biodiversity. However, they belong to the most threatened ecosystems in Europe due to drainage, land use intensification and cessation of traditional management. In such systems, evapotranspiration (ET) is an important hydrological process as it is the principal way of water loss. However, there is a knowledge gap concerning the effect of vegetation structure and management on this process. Thus, we quantify actual ET rate based on diurnal groundwater fluctuation in different vegetation and management types (forested, only-mowed, mowed/cleared) as well as analyze the differences in vegetation composition. We utilize medium-term, high frequency hydrological data from an alkaline fen in northern Germany as well as data on floral species composition and light availability. Our results show that ET rates are similar in the mowed fen with tree clearance (cleared/mowed fen) and in the only-mowed fen. The only-mowed fen has significantly higher ET rates compared to the alder carr and one part of the willow forest. Similarly the cleared/mowed fen also had significantly higher ET rates than those in the alder carr. Although the results are not entirely consistent with those of other authors, few studies support our findings. We conclude that the difference we observe may be caused by differences in microclimate such as lower temperature and wind speed and higher humidity in the forest, compared to the open fens. Species composition was significantly different between the forested fen and the cleared fen. (C) 2020 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB The capabilities of several multispectral satellite data types to identify the status of peatlands affected by peat extraction and abandoned deposits are examined to assess potential fire dangers and rewetting effectiveness. The available level of detail of describing land/vegetation cover for monitoring abandoned peat extraction sites using Spot-5 HRG, Spot-6 HRG, and Landsat-7 ETM+ satellite images has been demonstrated using the example of peatlands in the Meschera National Park (Vladimir oblast). The results reflect the pros and cons of using different data types to analyze the status of abandoned peat-extraction lands for purposes of peatland inventory, land-cover monitoring, and the prioritization of sites subject to rewetting and mire restoration, as well as for an evaluation of the effectiveness of these measures.

AB A peat deposit from the East European Russian Arctic, spanning nearly 10 000 years, was investigated to study soil organic matter degradation using analyses of bulk elemental and stable isotopic compositions and plant macrofossil remains. The peat accumulated initially in a wet fen that was transformed into a peat plateau bog following aggradation of permafrost in the late Holocene (similar to 2500 cal a BP). Total organic carbon and total nitrogen (N) concentrations are higher in the fen peat than in the moss-dominated bog peat layers. Layers in the sequence that have lower concentrations of total hydrogen (H) are associated with degraded vascular plant residues. C/N and H/C atomic ratios indicate better preservation of organic matter in peat material dominated by bryophytes as opposed to vascular plants. The presence of permafrost in the peat plateau stage and water-saturated conditions at the bottom of the fen stage appear to lead to better preservation of organic plant material. delta 15N values suggest N isotopic fractionation was driven primarily by microbial decomposition whereas differences in delta 13C values appear to reflect mainly changes in plant assemblages. Positive shifts in both delta 15N and delta 13C values coincide with a local change to drier conditions as a result of the onset of permafrost and frost heave of the peat surface. This pattern suggests that permafrost aggradation not only resulted in changes in vegetation but also aerated the underlying fen peat, which enhanced microbial denitrification, causing the observed 15N-enrichment.

AB Sphagnum mosses are a fundamental component of bog vegetation in northern regions, where these plants play a major role in controlling important ecosystem processes. As heat waves are expected to become increasingly intense and frequent, especially in cold territories, it is important to improve our knowledge of heat resistance in Sphagnum species. We investigated the response to heat stress of S. fuscum and S. magellanicum. Three populations of the two species collected at different altitudes (1090 m, 1870 m and 2100 m) were grown at three daytime temperature levels: 25 degrees C (AT); 36 degrees C (MT); 43 degrees C (HT). The HT treatment decreased concentrations of chlorophyll and nitrogen in the plant tissues, which resulted in lower net CO(2) exchange rates and quantum yield of PS(II). The plants recovered significantly within six days, probably because temperature in the living tissue did not reach lethal thresholds because of the high water content in the plant tissues. Contrary to our main hypothesis, that S. magellanicum had greater resistance to high temperatures because of its more southern distribution, the two species showed much the same response patterns to heat stress. Supporting our second hypothesis, populations of both species originating from the highest site suffered somewhat stronger, although still reversible, damage when grown at HT. Heat stress brought about by heat waves will unlikely have differential effects on these two Sphagnum species. We also conclude that heat waves are unlikely to exert irreversible damage to the Sphagnum layer in bog ecosystems if high temperatures are not coupled with drought. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hydrology has been suggested as the mechanism controlling vegetation and related surficial pore-water chemistry in large peatlands. Peatland hydrology influences the carbon dynamics within these large carbon reservoirs and will influence their response to global warming. A geophysical survey was completed in Caribou Bog, a large peatland in Maine, to evaluate peatland stratigraphy and hydrology. Geophysical measurements were integrated with direct measurements of peat stratigraphy from probing, fluid chemistry, and vegetation patterns in the peatland. Consistent with previous field studies, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) was an excellent method for delineating peatland stratigraphy. Prominent reflectors from the peat-lake sediment and lake sediment-mineral soil contacts were precisely recorded up to 8 m deep. Two-dimensional resistivity and induced polarization imaging were used to investigate stratigraphy beneath the mineral soil, beyond the range of GPR. We observe that the peat is chargeable, and that IP imaging is an alternative method for defining peat thickness. The chargeability of peat is attributed to the high surface-charge density on partially decomposed organic matter. The electrical conductivity imaging resolved glaciomarine sediment thickness (a confining layer) and its variability across the basin. Comparison of the bulk conductivity images with peatland vegetation revealed a correlation between confining layer thickness and dominant vegetation type, suggesting that stratigraphy exerts a control on hydrogeology and vegetation distribution within this peatland. Terrain conductivity measured with a Geonics EM31 meter correlated with confining glaciomarine sediment thickness and was an effective method for estimating variability in glaciomarine sediment thickness over approximately 18 km(2). Our understanding of the hydrogeology, stratigraphy, and controls on vegetation growth in this peatland was much enhanced from the geophysical study.

AB Measurements of carbon dioxide and water vapour flux densities were carried out for a disturbed raised peat bog in the north of the Netherlands during an 18 month continuous experiment. Tussock grass (sp. Molinea caerulae) mainly dominated the vegetation of the bog area. The maximum leaf area index (LAI) of the vegetation reached a numerical value of about 1.7 in mid-August.
   When the LAI is large enough (LAI > 0.2), a mean net uptake of carbon dioxide is observed with a clear daily pattern. The total evapotranspiration consists of a soil, an open water, and a plant transpiration part. When the LAI is large enough (LAI > 0.2), plant transpiration dominates the total evapotranspiration. The mean daily transpiration pattern, however, is not similar to the carbon dioxide uptake pattern.
   During the summer months, the daytime carbon dioxide uptake shows a single early morning maximum value followed by a decline in uptake during the rest of the day. The evapotranspiration, however, follows more or less the incoming short-wave radiation pattern. Effects of the vapour pressure deficit are suggested as a possible cause of this discrepancy.

AB Forestry-drained peatlands in the boreal region are currently undergoing restoration in order to bring these ecosystems closer to their natural (undrained) state. Drainage affects the methane (CH4) dynamics of a peatland, often changing sites from CH4 sources to sinks. Successful restoration of a peatland would include restoration of not only the surface vegetation and hydrology, but also the microbial populations and thus CH4 dynamics. As a pilot study, CH4 emissions were measured on two pristine, two drained and three restored boreal spruce swamps in southern Finland for one growing season. Restoration was successful in the sense that the water table level in the restored sites was significantly higher than in the drained sites, but it was also slightly higher than in the pristine sites. The restored sites were surprisingly large sources of CH4 (mean emissions of 52.84 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)), contrasting with both the pristine (1.51 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) and the drained sites (2.09 mg CH4 m-(2) d(-1)). More research is needed to assess whether the high CH4 emissions observed in this study are representative of restored spruce mires in general.

AB Choosing past and present-day indicators could strengthen the reference ecosystem used for ecological restoration projects. Based on the paleoecological analysis of four peat cores and the characterization of 13 contemporary natural sites, the reference ecosystem for minerotrophic peatlands in southeastern Canada is composed of two broad categories of plant assemblages described as tall-sedge and Sphagnum-Thuja/brown moss. In paleoecological peat profiles, tall-sedge communities were found at the transition between aquatic and terrestrial, and were associated with high graminoid production, riverine peatlands, and elevated water table in the present-day analyses. Sphagnum-Thuja communities resemble the present-day vegetation found in natural basin type peatlands. Except for Sphagnum warnstorfii Russ., these communities, with high taxonomical diversity, contain more generalist species from boreal peatland vegetation, such as Rhododendron groenlandicum (Oeder) Kron & Judd, Thuja occidentalis L., Linnaea borealis L., and Maianthemum trifolium L. They grow in dryer or shady habitats such as hummocks or forest understory. The importance of brown mosses was revealed by paleoecological analysis. Overall, findings from both approaches are complementary: paleoecological stratigraphy informs us about past ecosystem dynamics, while present-day inventories allow us to define current plant communities and their major environmental characteristics. The range of variability of vegetation and environmental variables found in these studies are essential tools for fen restoration projects.

DT Article
ID RANGE TRANSECTS; VEGETATION; TRENDS
AB Sphagnum peatlands or bogs in the Kosciuszko National Park ranging from montane to alpine in elevation were sampled on two occasions spanning a maximum interval of 32 years. Data analysed for individual samples (305 quadrats) clustered into consistent microhabitat (hummock/hollow) groups and subalpine/alpine subgroups. Quadrat data were aggregated for sites (13 bogs) and analysed for floristic trends over time. Cluster and ordination analyses showed a large change in a single montane bog, but relatively little composition (presence/absence) change for the subalpine and alpine bogs. Analyses of dominant species in alpine (three) and subalpine bogs (three) showed some temporal trends in cover. There appears to be an increase in the cover of Sphagnum and a decrease in shrub cover in the subalpine bogs over the 20-32 years. Changes in shrub cover in undisturbed subalpine sites are attributed to shrub senescence and lack of recruitment. Changes at a site with intensive ski field development (Smiggin Holes) were analysed separately and compared with adjacent sites with no such development. Sphagnum cover had not increased at this site and shrub decline was pronounced. Bare ground and ruderal species increased in cover whereas 13 native species that were originally recorded in 1959 were not re-recorded in 1991. The detection of vegetation change in bogs through monitoring is important for adaptive management of vegetation under intensive use.

AB Various peatland restoration strategies developed during the last two decades have aimed to stop degradation and bring back the original hydrology, biodiversity and other peatland functions. This study evaluated progress 6-15 years after rewetting in vegetation development, physicochemical properties of peat, soil organic matter (SOM) quality and microbial activity in previously long-term drained bogs and spruce swamp forests (SSF) in comparison with pristine and long-term drained sites in the Bohemian Forest, Czech Republic.
   Long-term drainage led to overall ecosystem degradation, indicated by a change in vegetation composition, reduced decomposability of peat, with high content of recalcitrant compounds and decreased pH, and reduced soil microbial biomass and activity. The degradation was more pronounced in SSF, while bogs seemed to be relatively resistant to environmental changes caused by drainage. Post-rewetting progress has occurred with regard to vegetation composition, peat pH, microbial biomass and potential anaerobic CO2 and CH4 production, all of which tending towards characteristics of the pristine sites. However, overall SOM quality has not yet responded significantly, indicating that some peat properties and functions, such as C accumulation, need much longer periods of time to return to the original level.

AB Nitrogen dynamics were quantified for two years using N-15 (as NH,CI at 3 g N m(-2) year(-1)) in a bog and a rich fen in continental western Canada. After two years, 81-88% of the applied nitrogen was recovered; 98.4-98.7% of the recovered nitrogen occurred in the top 45 cm of the moss-peat layer and 1.3-1.6% occurred in the above ground shrub component In the bog, 29% was recovered from the top 0-5 cm of Sphagnum fuscum, while in the fen 19% was recovered from this zone in Tomenthypnum nitens. Sphagnum sequestered the applied nitrogen more efficiently than did Tomenthypnum. However, over time Tomenthypnum retained it better in the upper moss layers. Overall, after two years Sphagnum retained 42% and Tomenthypnum 48% in the top 12 cm of the ground layer. The nitrogen of the current year's moss growth contained 26-28% applied nitrogen (% NDFF) after one season and 19-20% after two seasons. Moss production increased from 4-30% annually over the two year period, while production for Betula pumila in the fen and Ledum groenlandicum in the bog did not increase significantly. Decomposition of S. fuscum in the bag was significantly less than T. nitens in the fen after two years, but no differences were evident after nitrogen additions in either peatlands. We conclude that I) nearly all nitrogen is immediately sequestered by the mass layer; 2) much of this new nitrogen is found in the actively growing region and mass production increases; 3) shrubs are little affected by the additional nitrogen during the first two years and direct absorption of nitrogen through leaves is unimportant and 4) newly deposited nitrogen is tightly controlled by the moss layer in both bogs and fens. However retention patterns are different. Subsequent use of nitrogen by vascular plants is determined by nutrient release through decompositional processes deeper in the moss layer.

AB The chemical transformations that govern storage, degradation, and loss of organic matter in northern peatlands are poorly characterized, despite the significance of these peat deposits as pivotal reservoirs in the global carbon cycle. One of the most challenging problems concerns the character of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in peat porewaters, particularly higher-molecular weight compounds that may function either as non-reactive sinks or reactive intermediates for organic byproducts of microbial decay. The complexity of these large molecules has defied attempts to characterize their molecular structure in bulk samples with a high degree of precision. We therefore determined the composition and reactivity of DOM from representative bog and fen sites in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands (GLAP) in northern Minnesota, USA. We applied four complementary techniques: electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR MS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR), specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. We observed that the vast majority (>80%) of molecular formulas that appear in the surface bog DOM are also present at 2.9 m depth, indicating that much of DOM in the bog is resistant to microbial degradation. In contrast to bog samples, a considerable number of new compounds with low O/C and high H/C elemental ratios were observed in the 3 m fen horizon relative to surface samples. These results indicate a more pronounced difference in the composition of surface and deep DOM in the fen.
   SUVA, determined at 254 nm, indicated significantly lower aromaticity in deep fen samples relative to deep bog samples. This trend was verified by H-1 NMR. Aromatic and carbohydrate components represented up to 70% of deep bog DOM but comprised a much smaller proportion of deep fen DOM, which was dominated by functionalized and non-functionalized aliphatics. Molecular formula data determined by FT-ICR mass spectrometry were consistent with results from optical and NMR spectroscopy measurements and showed that compounds with low O/C and high H/C were generated with depth in the fen. Such compounds were absent in both surface fen and in surface and deep bog samples respectively, providing further evidence of qualitative and quantitative differences in the evolution of DOM in fens and bogs. These differences, attributed to either variations in source vegetation or environmental factors that render DOM more reactive in fen sites or less reactive in bog sites, have important implications for the response of peatlands to climate change, since climatic change leading to moister conditions may enhance the abundance of sedge-dominated fens and increase the pool of more labile soil carbon.

AB Peatlands of the Western Boreal Plains are under stress from oil and gas development and associated infrastructure such as road construction and removal. An improved understanding of nutrient cycling and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange interactions in peatlands can assist in recommending best management practices to industry to minimize the ecohydrological disturbance footprint of road features. Peat nutrient (nitrogen, N, and phosphorus, P) supply, net mineralization, groundwater concentrations, and peatland-atmosphere CO2 exchange rates were quantified within a poor fen bisected by a semi-permanent road located in the Athabasca Oil Sands region of Alberta, Canada, over one growing season. Results demonstrate that the road impeded groundwater movement across the site; however, water table and moisture differences were minimal, likely due to the unusually wet season. No clear impacts of the road on nutrient dynamics were observed, but subtle differences in productivity and respiration resulted in significantly lower net CO2 sequestration (net ecosystem exchange) on the down-flow side of the road. Differences in vegetation composition between sides of the road were apparent and likely indicate longer-term moisture differences at the site. Elevated rates of productivity and respiration coincided with a seasonal change in the relative supplies of N and P (increased N:P ratios), suggesting that the relative availability of N versus P may be important to CO2 fluxes in Western Boreal Plains peatlands. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the need to capture interactions between hydrology, ecology and nutrient biogeochemistry when evaluating peatland carbon cycling response to road disturbances across this region.

AB Carbon gases with younger C-14 ages than those of the surrounding peat have been reported from continental boreal peatlands, a fact which suggests that significant movement of CO2, CH4, or DOC (dissolved organic carbon) and export of C via subsurface processes are not accounted for in most estimates of contributions to the C cycle. This paper tests the hypothesis that similar processes can occur in oceanic ombrotrophic mires where water and gas movement is theoretically minimal. Measurements of C-14 and delta(13)C in CO2, CH4, and DOC, and of tritium, are reported from depths to 250 cm at Tor Royal, a raised mire in southwest England. Radiocarbon ages of gases are 1460 to 500 yr younger than those of peat from the same depths, and CO2 is consistently younger than CH4. DOC is 1260 to 830 yr younger than the peat, and significant amounts of tritium were found at all depths, Gas ages are mostly intermediate between the age of the peat and that of the DOC, which suggests that C is principally transported as DOC. However, some gases are younger than their associated DOG, which implies that movement of dissolved gases may also take place. delta(13)C values in gases suggest that CO2 reduction is the major pathway for CH4 production. Transport of C in deep peats is likely to be a significant component in the overall C budget of ombrotrophic oceanic peatlands, and C export via discharge to ground or surface waters may be an important mechanism for gaseous C emissions.

AB Temporal and spatial variation in CH4 emissions was studied at hummock, Eriophorum lawn, flark and Carex lawn microsites in an oligotrophic pine fen over the growing season using a static chamber method, and CH4 production and oxidation potentials in peat profiles from hummock and flark were determined in laboratory incubation experiments. Emissions were lowest in the hummocks, and decreased with increasing hummock height, while in the lawns and flarks they increased with increasing sedge cover. Statistical response functions with water table and peat temperature as independent variables were calculated in order to reconstruct seasonal CH4 emissions by reference to the time series for peat temperature and water table specific to each microsite type. Mean CH4 emissions in the whole area in the snow-free period of 1993, weighted in terms of the proportions of the microsites, were 1.7 mol CH4 m(-2). Potential CH4 production and oxidation rates were very low in the hummocks rising above the groundwater table, but were relatively similar when expressed per dry weight of pear both in the hummocks and flarks below the water table. The CH4 production potential increased in autumn at both microsites and CH4 oxidation potential seemed to decrease. The decrease in temperature in autumn certainly reduced in situ decomposition processes, possibly leaving unused substrates in the peat, which would explain the increase in CH4 production potential.

AB Although recent studies have recognized Northern Eurasian ecosystems as an important carbon reservoir, little is known about the forest-peatland interactions in a boreal environment induced by ongoing climatic changes. This study focuses on the evaluation of both the long-term and contemporary trends of land-cover changes and rates of lateral extension of peat-accumulating wetlands toward the adjacent forests, estimated at the southern climatic range of the Sphagnum-dominated mires in Western Siberia. We used the radiocarbon dates and stratigraphy of peat sediments from seven peat cores, analyzed at two types of forest-peatland ecotones, which are located close to each other but differ by topography and composition of their plant communities. The rate of lateral extension was found in a wide range varying from 2.3 to 791.7 cm yr(-1). It was observed to be rapid during the initial stage of mire development, but to have slowed down over the last 2000-3000 yr. Our results, therefore, strongly contradict the concept of progressive peat accumulation throughout the late Holocene and contribute to our knowledge about ongoing land-cover change in the natural ecosystems of the Northern hemisphere.

AB This study proposed that due to their high standing water tables that peatlands would be cold humid islands within their landscape, and especially so relative to farmland on mineral soils. To test this hypothesis, we measured air temperature and humidity at 17 locations along a 7.8 km transect across the UK's largest lowland raised bog from February 2018 to January 2019. Air temperature and humidity were measured hourly for 1 year and supported with spot albedo measurements. The study represented a factorial experiment with respect to sites of measurement, the type of land use (peat vs. arable land) and time of sampling over both the seasonal and diurnal cycles. We show that: (a) That although mean annual temperature was not significantly different between arable and peatlands, the arable land showed a decreased amplitude to its seasonal cycle - this is the reverse of the expected pattern. (b) The albedo of the peatland was significantly lower than that of arable land showing that vegetated peatland still absorbed more solar radiation. (c) The specific humidity was lower on the peatland than on the surrounding arable land. The study showed that while shrubby vegetation exists over a peatland then energy budgets are more likely to be dominated by the lower aerodynamic resistance and lower albedo of the vegetated peatland relative to arable land. Thus, shrub-dominated peatlands will not be a cold humid island in their landscape.

AB Detailed modelling of the hydrological setting of fen meadows appears to be possible provided that detailed information on geomorphology, hydrochemistry and piezometric heads is available fcr a number of years. In the Laegieskamp, a small wetland reserve located in the central part of The Netherlands, a piezometric monitoring network was sampled for water quality analysis and piezometric heads between 1986 and 1992. Average yearly discharge and recharge periods were used for FLOWNET calculations. First, the models were used to determine, with the help of information on water quality, the hydrological systems in the study area. Secondly, they were used to define the present and past hydrological setting of a fen meadow in the reserve. The hydrological systems and water quality in the study area have changed considerably over the past 65 years. At present the fen meadow is mainly fed by precipitation. The mineral-rich conditions favouring the fen meadow vegetation are thought to be maintained thanks to a clayey peat layer and an oscillating shallow water body that prevents rapid leaching of minerals. The sulphate content in the fen exhibits a pattern of temporal variation, which is related to the severity of the annual drought. Our study showed that groundwater flow is mainly lateral, instead of the assumed vertical infiltration of groundwater in previous regional studies. This led us to the conclusion that conservation and restoration perspectives are much better than previously expected. The polluted middle, deep groundwater is not a major threat to this fen at the moment. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The restoration of extracted peatlands poses challenges with regard to their recolonisation by vegetation. The most significant problems are unstable water levels, destroyed propagule bank, and temperature fluctuations on bare peat surfaces. Rewetting is considered necessary for the re-establishment of peat-forming vegetation. Revegetation was investigated in a long-term field study at two rewetted extracted peatland sites in southcentral Sweden, namely Vastkarr (originally a lagg fen) and Porla (originally a bog). Both sites were expanses of bare peat before rewetting.
   Rewetting procedures were applied in 1999 and strongly promoted plant colonisation. At Vastkarr, colonisation started in the first year after rewetting, mostly by species that were not found during repeat vegetation surveys 15 years later. By 2014, Vastkarr was a shallow lake surrounded by mesotrophic and eutrophic vegetation with species such as Carex rostrata, Lemna minor, Typha latifolia, Phalaris arundinacea and Phragmites australis. Revegetation of the Porla site was slower and started with Eriophorum vaginatum and Polytrichum spp. Sphagnum mosses appeared after six years and had established quite well after 13 years. A residual Sphagnum peat layer, inflowing surface water and groundwater provided spatially variable nutrient conditions. Sphagnum species and E. vaginatum established in nutrient-poor areas, while C. rostrata, P. australis and Eriophorum angustifolium colonised more nutrient-rich locations.

DE coal; Virginia; Mississippian; maceral; semianthracite
AB Tournasian (Mississippian) Price Formation semianthracites (R-max = 2.40%) in the Valley Fields of south-western Virginia contain a lithotype described in an early-20th-century report as a "sand" coal. The Center for Applied Energy Research inherited a collection of coals containing sand coal specimens, making it possible to study the lithotype from the long-closed mines.
   The sand coal consists of rounded quartz sand and maceral assemblages (secretinite, corpogelinite, and rounded collotelinite) along with banded collotelinite, vitrodetrinite, and inertodetrinite assemblages. The association of rounded macerals and similar-size quartz grains suggests transport. Oxidation rims surrounding the rounded collotelinite provides further evidence for transport.
   Due to the semianthracite rank, palynology could not be performed. Stratigraphic evidence indicates that the Lepidodendropsis flora would have been the dominant mire vegetation. Pteridosperms in this assemblage could have contributed resin rodlets, subsequently metamorphosed to collogelinite or secretinite. While a resin rodlet origin is an intriguing possibility for the origin of the rounded macerals (at least some of the rounded maceral, the rounded collotelinite clearly has a different origin), we cannot definitively prove this origin.

AB [1] Production and emission of peat gas has attracted great interest because substantial amounts of methane ( CH4) are emitted to the atmosphere from peat soils. Many studies indicate supersaturation of CH4 in peat water, implying a high potential for gas bubble formation. However, observations of bubbles in peat are often only qualitatively described, and in most cases the presence of entrapped gas has been largely ignored in peatland studies. On the basis of a review of literature, a conceptual model of entrapped gas dynamics was developed and investigated using field and laboratory measurements at a poor fen in central Quebec. We investigated variations in production and volume of gas and the effect of this gas on trace gas emissions, peat buoyancy, and pore water chemistry during 2002 and 2003. Measurements made with moisture probes and subsurface gas collectors revealed that gas volume varied throughout the growing season in relation to hydrostatic and barometric pressure. Shifts in entrapped gas volume were also coincident with changes in dissolved pore water CH4. The presence of these bubbles has important biogeochemical effects, including the development of localized CH4 diffusion gradients, alteration of local flow paths affecting substrate delivery, peat buoyancy, and the potential episodic release of CH4 via ebullition events. These interactions must be included in peatland models to describe accurately the hydrology and greenhouse gas emissions from these ecosystems and to make predictions about their response to environmental change.

AB Mirabel bog (southern Quebec) was studied with the aim of specifying the past influence of local vegetation on peat accumulation. This influence was essentially translated by the reduction of minerotrophic inputs and peat accumulation induced by the highering of the peatland surface. Extremely rich initial conditions allow to explain the very high accumulations of the beginning of the Holocene, observed in various plant communities, among which Larix forests with ferns and Carex without modern analogues. Moreover, the structure (forest density) and the composition (dominance of Cyperaceae or Ericaceae) of these communities have locally controlled the dynamic of peat accumulation. These results point out the interest of the confrontation between palynological and macrofossil data and the spatialisation of palaeoecological studies.

AB Using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to map subsurface patterns in peat physical properties, we investigated the developmental history of meso-scale surface patterning of microforms within a raised bog. Common offset GPR measurements were obtained along a 45-m transect, at frequencies ranging from 100 to 900 MHz. We found that low-frequency (central frequency < 240 MHz) GPR could not adequately represent the subsurface structures of the peatland because individual peat layers were too thin. However, more detailed high-frequency measurements (central frequency >= 240 MHz) showed a striking pattern of subsurface reflections that dip consistently in a northerly direction. The angle of these dipping reflectors is calculated using a semblance algorithm and was shown to average 3.9 degrees between a depth of 1.0 and 2.5 m. These dipping reflectors may indicate downslope migration of surface microforms during the development of the peatland. Based on the estimated angle and the rate of peat accumulation, the average rate of downslope propagation of these surface microforms is calculated at 9.8 mm per year. Further survey work is required to establish whether the downslope migration is common across the peatland.

AB In the discontinuous permafrost zone of boreal western continental Canada, permafrost is limited almost exclusively to ombrotrophic peatlands. Permafrost in peatlands recently has been degrading and continues to degrade at its southern limit across western Canada, with no evidence of regeneration. The melting of permafrost could have dramatic effects on organic matter accumulation, organochemical properties, and nutrient status in peatlands. Our objectives are to quantify differences in peat chemistry (i.e., concentrations of organic fractions, N, P, and S) and rates of organic matter accumulation over the past 200 years between a site with permafrost, a site with degraded permafrost (internal lawn), and three sites with no evidence of permafrost since the last glaciation (continental peatlands: two bogs and one poor Fen). Results indicate that pear chemistry may differ according to the presence, absence, or degradation of permafrost. Recent rates of organic matter accumulation follow similar trends over the past 100-200 years in the permafrost and continental bogs; however, net rates of organic matter accumulation are accelerated by 60% in the internal lawn. As decomposition in peatlands is influenced by nutrient limitations and organic matter quality, peat chemistry is likely to be a critical factor in the carbon balance response of boreal peatlands to climate change.

AB Localized permafrost formation and melt at the southern limit of permafrost has a large effect on boreal bog plant community structure and diversity in continental western Canada (Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordinations show that non-permafrost-affected bogs. areas currently underlain by permafrost (frost mounds), and areas of permafrost degradation (internal lawns) have distinct plant communities. Bryophytes respond more strongly than vascular plants to lengthened environmental gradients in the bogs studied. Seventy-two vascular plant and bryophyte species were found, with mean alpha diversity (species richness) similar in bogs and internal lawns (22.6 and 22.1) and lowest on frost mounds (15.6). Beta diversity (species turnover between landforms) is greater for bryophytes (4.22) than vascular plants (2.54). Comparisons within internal lawns show highly variable height above water table, community composition, and species diversity in wet communities and reduced variability as peat accumulates and converges on dry surfaces dominated by Sphagnum fuscum (Schimp.) Klinggr. Overall, localized permafrost dynamics increase bog plant diversity by 47% by introduction of unique dry, shaded (frost mound) and wet, open (internal lawn) conditions absent from non-permafrost-affected bogs, making localized permafrost bogs one of the most bryologically diverse peatland types in western Canada.

AB Because anthropogenic stressors have caused mire degradations in the subarctic northern Japan such as the drying and the invasion of alder-dominant shrub forest, the Japanese governments recently started a new project to restore a meandering former river channel in the catchment in order to diminish shrub forest and to recover mire ecosystem. In this study, the author developed the integrated catchment-based eco-hydrology model to include the mass transport and vegetation succession processes in the mire (NICE-VEG). NICE-VEG simulated the water/heat budget, the mass transport, and vegetation succession processes iteratively including the competition between two vegetation types (alder-dominant shrub forest and reed-sedge vegetation) in order to evaluate the relationship between drying and alder invasion in the mire and to clarify a method for mire recovery. NICE-VEG reproduced well the alder invasion in the mire so far by various anthropogenic stressors, which indicate that it is important to add newly the growth reduction factor for water table depth in the model. Simulation results indicated that restoring meanders to the river channel could be effective for decreasing discharge and sediment loading of the river, and increasing groundwater level at the downstream of restoration area around the mire. Simulation also forecasted the mire recovery more or less by restoring meanders to the river channel in the future. These results suggest that the policy of river restoration could be effective as one of mire conservation plans for the recovery of mire vegetation. It is powerful to apply the process-based model to assess the linkage of hydrological change and vegetation succession. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Seepages occurring at high altitudes in the Hottentots Holland Mountains (HHM) (Western Cape Province, South Africa) were subject to a phytosociological survey. Releve sampling method and classification procedures of the floristic-sociological (Braun-Blanquet) approach as well as numerical data analyses (numerical classification and ordination) were used to reveal syntaxonomic patterns and characterize the position of the syntaxa along major environmental gradients. Nine plant communities were recognized, three of which were classified as associations, following formal syntaxonomic and nomenclatural rules of the floristic-sociological approach. Most of the studied mire communities were dominated by low-growing clonal restios (Restionaceae), whereas some consisted of other types of graminoids. The most important species determining the structure (and function) of the mire communities on sandstones of the HHM include restios Anthochortus crinalis, Chondropetalum deustum, C. mucronatum, Elegia intermedia, E. thyrsifera, Restio subtilis, R. purpurascens, cyperoids Epischoenus villosus, Ficinia argyropa, grasses Ehrharta setacea subsp. setacea, Pentameris hirtiglumis as well as shrubs Berzelia squarrosa, Cliffortia tricuspidata, Erica intervallaris and Grubbia rosmarinifolia. Protea lacticolor and Restio perplexus dominate a rare shale band seepage community. There are two major groups of communities - the fens (dominated by carpets of Anthochortus crinalis and other low-growing species) and the restio marshlands (mosaics of low tussocks of Restio subtilis and tall Chondropetalum mucronatum). The degree of soil (and water) minerotrophy was found to be the most important differentiating feature between the mire (fen and restio marshland) communities studied. The soils in the centre of mires were found to have high contents of peat and showed very little influence from the underlying sandstone. The soils along the mire margins had a greater admixture of mineral soil derived from the sandstone or shale bedrock.

AB Palsa mires, nutrient poor permafrost peatlands common in subarctic regions, store a significant amount of carbon (C) and it has been hypothesized their net ecosystem C balance (NECB) is sensitive to climate change. Over two years we measured the NECB for Stordalen palsa mire and found it to accumulate 46 g C m(-2) yr(-1). While Stordalen NECB is comparable to nutrient poor peatlands without permafrost, the component fluxes differ considerably in magnitude. Specifically, Stordalen had both lower growing season CO2 uptake and wintertime CO2 losses, but importantly also low dissolved organic carbon exports and hydrocarbon (mainly methane) emissions. Restricted C losses from palsa mires are likely to have facilitated C accumulation of unproductive subarctic permafrost peatlands. Continued climate change and permafrost thaw is likely to amplify several component fluxes, with an uncertain overall effect on NECB - highlighting the necessity for projections of high-latitude C storage to consider all C fluxes.

   METHANOGENESIS
AB Boreal peatlands contain approximately 500Pg carbon (C) in the soil, emit globally significant quantities of methane (CH4), and are highly sensitive to climate change. Warming associated with global climate change is likely to increase the rate of the temperature-sensitive processes that decompose stored organic carbon and release carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4. Variation in the temperature sensitivity of CO2 and CH4 production and increased peat aerobicity due to enhanced growing-season evapotranspiration may alter the nature of peatland trace gas emission. As CH4 is a powerful greenhouse gas with 34 times the warming potential of CO2, it is critical to understand how factors associated with global change will influence surface CO2 and CH4 fluxes. Here, we leverage the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) climate change manipulation experiment to understand the impact of a 0-9 degrees C gradient in deep belowground warming (Deep Peat Heat, DPH) on peat surface CO2 and CH4 fluxes. We find that DPH treatments increased both CO2 and CH4 emission. Methane production was more sensitive to warming than CO2 production, decreasing the C-CO2:C-CH4 of the respired carbon. Methane production is dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis but deep peat warming increased the C-13 of CH4 suggesting an increasing contribution of acetoclastic methanogenesis to total CH4 production with warming. Although the total quantity of C emitted from the SPRUCE Bog as CH4 is <2%, CH4 represents >50% of seasonal C emissions in the highest-warming treatments when adjusted for CO2 equivalents on a 100-year timescale. These results suggest that warming in boreal regions may increase CH4 emissions from peatlands and result in a positive feedback to ongoing warming.

AB Floating islands mysteriously moving around on lakes were described by several Latin authors almost two millennia ago. These fascinating ecosystems, known as free-floating mires, have been extensively investigated from ecological, hydrological and management points of view, but there have been no detailed studies of their rates of accumulation of organic matter (OM), organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN). We have collected a peat core 4 m long from the free-floating island of Posta Fibreno, a relic mire in Central Italy. This is the thickest accumulation of peat ever found in a free-floating mire, yet it has formed during the past seven centuries and represents the greatest accumulation rates, at both decadal and centennial timescale, of OM (0.63 vs. 0.37 kg/m(2)/yr), OC (0.28 vs. 0.18 kg/m(2)/yr) and TN (3.7 vs. 6.1 g/m(2)/yr) ever reported for coeval peatlands. The anomalously high accretion rates, obtained using C-14 age dating, were confirmed using Pb-210 and Cs-137: these show that the top 2 m of Sphagnum-peat has accumulated in only similar to 100 years. As an environmental archive, Posta Fibreno offers a temporal resolution which is 10x greater than any terrestrial peat bog, and promises to provide new insight into environmental changes occurring during the Anthropocene.

AB Decomposition of organic materials, oxygen consumption, and carbon dioxide emission were investigated in Masukata raire, a small minerotrophic mire in central Japan. We selected three dominant community types in the mire, a Sphagnum palustre community, a Phragmites australis community, and an Alnus japonica community, for the decomposition study sites. Decomposition rates were measured in the field by examining mass loss of peat and cellulose for 6 months. The oxygen consumption rate was measured in the field using a closed chamber equipped with an oxygen electrode. The carbon dioxide emission rate of the peat was measured by an infrared gas analyser in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Results of these measurements were tested by correlation analysis. The rate of mass loss of peat positively correlated with the CO2 emission rate. The cellulose decomposition rate showed significant differences among community types, and it had significant positive correlation with the oxygen consumption rate. Although oxygen consumption measurement is not generally used to estimate peatland soil respiration, the oxygen consumption method can be used for predicting long-term decomposition rate according to different vegetation types within a short time.

AB Peatland development and carbon accumulation on the Pacific coast of Canada have received little attention in paleoecological studies, despite wetlands being common landscape features. Here, we present a multi-proxy paleoenvironmental study of an ombrotrophic bog in coastal British Columbia. Following decreases in relative sea level, the wetland was isolated from marine waters by 13,300 cal yr BP. Peat composition, non-pollen palynomorph, and C and N analyses demonstrate terrestrialization from an oligotrophic lake to a marsh by 11,600 cal yr BP, followed by development of a poor fen, and then a drier ombrotrophic bog by 8700 cal yr BP. Maximum carbon accumulation occurred during the early Holocene fen stage, when seasonal differences in insolation were amplified. This highlights the importance of seasonality in constraining peatland carbon sequestration by enhancing productivity during summer and reducing decomposition during winter. Pollen analysis shows that Pinus contorta dominated regional forests by 14,000 cal yr BP. Warm and relatively dry summers in the early Holocene allowed Pseudotsuga menziesii to dominate lowland forests 11,200-7000 cal yr BP. Tsuga heterophylla and P. menziesii formed coniferous forest in the mid- and late Holocene. Tephra matching the mid-Holocene Glacier Peak-Dusty Creek assemblage provides evidence of its most northwesterly occurrence to date.

AB Blanket peatlands are globally rare, and many have been severely eroded. Natural recovery and revegetation ('self-restoration') of bare peat surfaces are often observed but are poorly understood, thus hampering the ability to reliably predict how these ecosystems may respond to climatic change. We hypothesised that morphometric/topographic-related microclimatic variables may be key controls on successional pathways and vegetation patterning in self-restoring blanket peatlands. We predicted the occurrence probability of four common peatland plant species (Calluna vulgaris, Eriophorum vaginatum, Eriophorum angustifolium, and Sphagnum spp.) using a digital surface model (DSM) generated from drone imagery at a pixel size of 20 cm, a suite of variables derived from the DSM, and an ensemble learning method (random forests). All four species models provided accurate fine-scale predictions of habitat suitability (accuracy > 90%, area under curve (AUC) > 0.9, recall and precision > 0.8). Mean elevation (within a 1 m radius) was often the most influential variable. Topographic position, wind exposure, and the heterogeneity or ruggedness of the surrounding surface were also important for all models, whilst light-related variables and a wetness index were important in the Sphagnum model. Our approach can be used to improve prediction of future responses and sensitivities of peatland recovery to climatic changes and as a tool to identify areas of blanket peatlands that may self-restore successfully without management intervention.

AB 1. In many ombrotrophic bog areas the invasion of grass (e.g. Molinia caerulea) and tree (e.g. Betula pubescens) species has become a major problem. We investigated whether the invasion of such species is due to high atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition by conducting a fertilization experiment.
   2. The effects of experimentally increased N input on Molinia, Betula and Eriophorum vaginatum were studied in desiccated bog vegetation in Ireland, where there is relatively low background N deposition. Four different N treatments were applied for 3 years: 0 (control), 2, 4 and 8 g m(-2) year(-1).
   3. Ammonium and nitrate concentrations in the peat moisture increased at high N addition rates, leading to significantly higher carbon : nitrogen (C : N) and nitrogen : phosphorus (N : P) ratios in the top layer of the peat. The potential CO2 production rate of the peat was not stimulated at high N addition rates due to severe acidification of the peat.
   4. Despite high tissue N : P ratios (above 40), above-ground biomass production by Molinia was stimulated at high N addition rates, and foliar nutrient concentrations were unaffected. In contrast to Molinia, Betula and Eriophorum were unable to increase their above-ground biomass, probably due to P limitation. Regrowth of the lichen Cladonia portentosa was suppressed at high N addition rates.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that the invasion of bogs by Molinia and Betula is likely to be less affected by desiccation than by increased N availability. Apparently, Molinia is well adapted to P-limiting conditions, which may explain its success in regions with increased N deposition levels. The high availability of P in many Dutch bogs compared with Irish bogs, together with prolonged high N deposition levels, may explain the strong increase in both Molinia and Betula observed in the Netherlands. As long as N and P availabilities in Dutch bogs are too high to prevent invasion of Betula and/or Molinia, management measures stimulating growth of Sphagnum mosses could probably reduce the negative effects of high N deposition levels.

AB Mires are continental wetlands of high scientific and conservation interest. Knowing the seed germination traits of mire species is essential for understanding their regeneration ecology and conducting active restoration policies. Here, a comparative study of seed germination traits was performed with 34 plant species from bog and fen communities, including many European indicators of these habitats. Freshly collected seeds were exposed to a laboratory germination experiment designed to characterize their response to (1) cold stratification and (2) simulated field temperatures. Germination strategy groups were interpreted according to these responses, and the relation between these groups and different mire types was discussed. Seeds of all tested species had physiological dormancy. Most of them showed conditional type 2 non-deep physiological dormancy: fresh seeds could germinate only at warm temperature, but attained the ability to germinate at colder temperature as they lost dormancy. Most mire species from bogs, poor fens and base-rich fens followed a warm germination strategy analogous to that of other wetland species. Species from this warm group responded to very warm temperatures which rarely occur in the field, and this was interpreted as a gap-detecting mechanism. In contrast, species from calcareous springs and flushes had a cold germination strategy, which would fit with the cold and stable soils where they occur. Finally, a group of species associated with the pioneer Rhynchosporion vegetation of bare peat areas had very low germination, suggesting an intermediate or deep seed dormancy and a long term seed bank.

AB Forested peatlands store significant amounts of soil carbon (C) compared with upland forests and are strongly influenced by climatic parameters. Carbon stocks at peatland margins, although likely to be most sensitive to changes in climate, have not been well quantified, making it difficult to predict their response to climate change. The purpose of this study was to characterize the physical environment and associated changes in C stocks across the forested margins of two boreal fens. Peat depth increased and water table depth decreased toward the peatland centre, and these parameters acted as the controlling environmental variables. Above-ground biomass C was primarily derived from tree biomass and decreased from upland to peadand, despite an opposite trend in understorey (herbaceous and shrubby) biomass stocks. Leaf area index was related to peat depth through a negative power function and increased linearly with above-ground tree biomass. Total ecosystem C increased from upland to peatland, with minimum and maximum values of 270 and 2100 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, and was largely dominated by soil C stocks, even at the upland end of the gradient. Although numerous small trees toward the peatland interior might allow a rapid increase in tree biomass C with lowering water tables, it seems likely that this would be a limited response, overshadowed in the long term by declines in the more substantial soil C stocks.

AB Based on their luminescence and infinite radiocarbon ages, organic deposits beneath till at two sites on the Smaland peneplain, southern Sweden (Nybygget and Stora Gaddevik), are concluded to have formed before the Middle Weichselian. Applied palaeoecological methods include analyses of pollen, diatoms, charcoal fragments, macroscopic remains of vascular plants and mosses, and insect remains. Pollen-stratigraphical correlations with previously studied interglacial/interstadial sites in southern Sweden, Denmark and northern Germany suggest that the peat at Nybygget dates from the BrOrup interstadial or the final stage of the Eemian interglacial, whereas the lake sediments at Stora Gaddevik probably were emplaced during the middle Eemian. We conclude that the peat was formed in a wetland characterized by both wood swamp and open mire vegetation, and surrounded by semi-open woodlands dominated by pine, birch and hazel. The middle Eemian sequence at the Stora Gaddevik site provides evidence of a moderately nutrient-rich to nutrient-rich lake environment with relatively diverse aquatic vegetation. Regional vegetation, as reconstructed using the REVEALS model, was spruce woodland mixed with pine, alder and birch, but also included more open environments with hazel, oak, grasslands and sedge-dominated wetlands. Water shield (Brasenia schreberi), now extinct in Europe, was identified in the Eemian lake deposits, from both pollen and macroscopic remains.

AB The postglacial development of peatland systems has had a strong influence on the global carbon cycle. Peatland effects on carbon cycling involve changes in both large-scale structure and community composition. The rate of C sequestration declines as a peat deposit grows, and methane emission increases as wet microhabitats expand in area. We examine the theoretical basis, underlying assumptions, and empirical evidence for two highly influential models of peatland form and development: Clymo's bog growth model (BGM) and Ingram's groundwater mound hypothesis (GMH). Our detailed theoretical analysis reveals previously unrecognized consequences of the models and, for the BGM, unrealistically stringent conditions for application. Our review of model assumptions and empirical evidence identifies the principal limitations of these models: they ignore spatial heterogeneity in peatland structure and function, fast processes occurring near the peatland surface, and interactions between peat accumulation and hydrological conditions. As a result, these models are unable to predict the effects of bog growth on hydrological conditions or peat-forming processes.
   We introduce five conceptual models of peatland development that differ in how bog size and shape change over time, and we examine the consequences of each model for hydrological conditions. This exercise shows how bog height growth and lateral expansion change the boundary conditions constraining peatland dynamics, and so determine the direction of ecosystem development. We link peatland properties to the four general properties of ''complex adaptive systems'' (CAS): spatial heterogeneity, localized flows, self-organizing structure and nonlinearity. We also present a framework for modeling peatlands as CAS. In this framework, the system is disaggregated, both vertically and horizontally, into a set of components that interact locally through flows of energy and resources. Both internal dynamics and external forcing drive changes in hydrological conditions and microhabitat pattern, and these autogenic and allogenic changes in peatland structure affect hydrological processes, which, in turn, constrain peatland development and carbon cycling. We conclude by outlining four areas in which further empirical research is urgently needed.

AB Peatlands long have been considered to preserve the record of atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic contaminants such as Pb.  In the past two decades, Pb-210 hs been widely used to date recent strata of peat and to calculate accumulation rates.  The assumption that Pb and Pb-210 are immobile and not subject to diagenesis in peat has been questioned but not rigorously tested.  We attempted to determine if Pb is mobile in peatlands and Pb profiles are altered by diagenic processes by constructing a mass balance for Pb about a small peatland, by comparing inventories, concentrations, and accumulation rates of Pb and Pb-210 in peatlands across northeastern North America, and by examining the relationship between concentrations of Pb in bog waters and peat in numerous sites.  Our results clearly demonstrate that Pb and Pb-210 are mobilized by the organic-rich waters of peatlands.  Profiles of Pb and Pb-210 at depths below the water table do not preserve the record of atmospheric deposition, and inventories fo Pb and Pb-210 are depleted in peatland hollows.  Concentrations of Pb in bog waters are regulated by the concentration of Pb in the peat and the concentration of dissolved organic carbon.  The mass balance for one bog indicated that over the specific three-year period of study more than 30% of inputs of Pb were not retained within the peat.  As a result of this mobility, dates based on Pb-210 can be biased and inaccurate by as much as 30 years.  Dates based on Pb-210 should be verified by other techniques, especially when the inventory of Pb-210 is less than that expected from local rates of deposition.

AB Sphagnum is the major genus in northern peatlands that contributes to peat formation and carbon sequestration. Sphagnum growth in summer has been fairly well studied but the information about growth in autumn and winter is limited. Therefore, we studied how the growth of Sphagnum is seasonally distributed with a particular interest on possible winter growth. The linear increment and biomass production of three Sphagum species was measured in three Northern European bogs over a year. In all sites, our results indicate the highest annual linear increment in S. angustifolium (28 mm), followed by S. magellanicum (20 mm) and S. fuscum (13 mm), but the biomass production was fairly even among the species (189, 192 and 215 g m(-2), respectively). Both linear increment and biomass production depended mostly on meteorological parameters rather than ecophysiological or microsite properties. The seasonal measurements revealed a significant linear increment and biomass production during the winter that accounted for ca. 10% and ca. 5% from the annual values, respectively. Moreover, the mean daily rates of linear increment in autumn often exceeded the increment in summer. Our results thus indicate the ability for year-around growth of Sphagna if the conditions are favorable, including during boreal winter.

AB We present the reconstruction of mire vegetation changes and fire history recorded in a continuous sediment profile that spans the last 20,000 cal yr BP from the Late Pleniglacial to Holocene in North-eastern Hungary. We also aimed to reveal past climate changes by using ecological requirements of specific aquatic plants as summer temperature indicators. Our results suggest the formation of a mesotrophic mire around 20,000 cal yr BP with brown moss, Betula sp. and Selaginella selaginoides cover beside the occurrence of Phragmites australis, Typha latifolia and T. angustifolia suggesting base-rich fen and tundra-like wet-ground habitats on the lakeshore. This community shifted to reed dominated swamp at c. 18,300 cal yr BP with inferred min. July temperatures of 12-15.7 degrees C. pinus sp., Betula nana, B. penduta/pubescens, Hippuris vulgaris and P. australis dominated until 16,600 cal yr BP pointing to shallow muddy stagnant water and colder climatic conditions than in the preceding interval. The most warmth-demanding species, T. latifolia and T. angustifolia indicated July mean temperatures >14-15.7 degrees C soon after the LGM. The formation of biogenic carbonate also started at an early stage; major accumulation occurred between 15,200 and 10,000 cal yr BP. In the Early Holocene, environmental indicator species (e.g., Phragmites australis and T. latifolia) pointed to warmer and shallower conditions, while the late Holocene was characterized by strong eutrophication and reed swamp dominance on the lakeshore. Elevated macrocharcoal concentration, wood fragments and remains of Typha species suggested frequent local fires and dry mire surface conditions during the last 1700 years. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The precursory mire of the Middle Pennsylvanian (Bolsovian) Lower Radnice Coal was buried in situ by volcanic ash, preserving the taxonomic composition, spatial distribution, vertical stratification, and synecology of this peat-forming ecosystem in extraordinary detail. Plant fossil remains represent the pre-eruption vegetation of the swamp, which resulted from accumulation of peat in a high-ash, planar (rheotrophic) mire situated in a narrow palaeovalley containing an active fluvial system. A tuff bed (the Belka) at the base of the volcaniclastic Whetstone Horizon was exposed in two contiguous excavations over an area of 50 m(2) in the Radnice Basin of western Bohemia, Czech Republic. Twenty-seven morphotaxa were identified, representing 20 whole-plant species with a wide variety of growth forms. The canopy of the peat-forming community was dominated by Cordaites borassifolius trees together with the arborescent lycopsid "Lepidodendron" (= Paralycopodites), whereas Lepidophloios cf. acerosus was subdominant. Evidence suggests that the laterally extensive "crowns" of these arborescent lycopsids; would have overlapped during the final phase of their life cycles, but differences in the height of tree species resulted in a complex and vertically variable canopy interrupted by randomly distributed gaps. The understorey was dominated by medullosan pteridosperms and marattialean tree ferns, whereas zygopterid ferns and sphenophylls; comprised the bulk of the ground cover. In comparison with the canopy, understorey and ground cover species were less abundant and patchier in distribution, with almost complete absence beneath the deep shade of C. borassifolius trees. Lianas that entwined arborescent trees were an important component of the peat-forming forest. Three lyginopterid pteridosperm species along with a sphenophyll had a lianescent habit based on their close association with upright or prone lycopsid trunks and "canopy" branches. Species richness in the swamp superficially appears low. However, considering the small area of excavation, along with the higher diversity known from the same tuff bed in the adjacent, former opencast Ovcin Mine, it appears that species richness in the forest was comparable to some of the less diverse Westphalian peat-forming swamps in the U.S.A. The Lower Radnice mire vegetation was compositionally homogeneous, but had a heterogeneous distribution with patchiness occurring at a very fine scale. The preserved plant assemblage most resembles mires dominated by medullosan pteridosperms and Paralycopodites described from upper Westphalian coal balls in the U.S.A., which were characterised by high diversity in all storeys and involved plants centred in high-ash peat-forming swamps.

Non-growing season carbon fluxes significantly contribute to annual carbon budgets in peatlands, yet their response to climate change is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the governing environmental variables of non-growing season carbon emissions in a northern peatland. We develop a support-vector regression model using a continuous 13-year dataset of eddy covariance flux measurements from the Mer Blue Bog, Canada. We determine that only seven variables were needed to reproduce carbon fluxes, which were most sensitive to net radiation above the canopy, soil temperature, wind speed and soil moisture. We find that changes in soil temperature and photosynthesis drove changes in net carbon flux. Assessing net ecosystem carbon exchange under three representative concentration pathways, we project a 103% increase in peatland carbon loss by 2100 under a high emissions scenario. We suggest that peatland carbon losses constitute a strong positive climate feedback loop.
   Future changes in non-growing season conditions, particularly irradiance and temperature, will enhance carbon emissions from a northern peatland, according to projections with a data-driven machine learning model.

AB For obscure reasons, sporophytes of the dioicous Hamatocaulis vernicosus are currently unknown in France. With the aim of understanding this failure of sporophyte production we investigated (1) sexual phenology, (2) sex ratio pattern at different spatial scales, (3) limitation of sporophyte formation by the availability of only one sex, (4) limitation of sporophyte formation caused by the distance between male and female, (5) location of sporophytes and (6) the consevation implications of this failure of sporophyte production. Principal results show that phenology cannot explain the failure of sporophyte production. At the regional scale, sporophyte formation is prevented by the fact that several mountain ranges have single-sex populations. The production of spore capsules relies on a strict combination of factors at the local scale: occurrence of sexually expressed mixed-sex colonies, a short distance between male and female individuals and favourable environmental factors (light grazing, high water table). In the Massif Central of France spore production is unlikely because of current unfavourable conditions. Fertility patterns appeared useful in a conservation context.

AB Thawing permafrost in the sub-Arctic has implications for the physical stability and biological dynamics of peatland ecosystems. This study provides an analysis of how permafrost thawing and subsequent vegetation changes in a sub-Arctic Swedish mire have changed the net exchange of greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 over the past three decades. Images of the mire (ca. 17 ha) and surroundings taken with film sensitive in the visible and the near infrared portion of the spectrum, [i.e. colour infrared (CIR) aerial photographs from 1970 and 2000] were used. The results show that during this period the area covered by hummock vegetation decreased by more than 11% and became replaced by wet-growing plant communities. The overall net uptake of C in the vegetation and the release of C by heterotrophic respiration might have increased resulting in increases in both the growing season atmospheric CO2 sink function with about 16% and the CH4 emissions with 22%. Calculating the flux as CO2 equivalents show that the mire in 2000 has a 47% greater radiative forcing on the atmosphere using a 100-year time horizon. Northern peatlands in areas with thawing sporadic or discontinuous permafrost are likely to act as larger greenhouse gas sources over the growing season today than a few decades ago because of increased CH4 emissions.

AB Samples from two lignite seams (Lower Seam, Upper Seam) of the Lavanttal basin (Austria) and additional xylite were investigated for variations in maceral composition, petrography-based facies indicators, bulk geochemical parameters, and molecular composition of hydrocarbons. Both seams originated in a topogenous mire and evolved within a transgressive setting. The final drowning of the mire is indicated by sapropelic shales. Whereas the sapropelic shale overlying the Lower Seam was deposited in a freshwater lake, the sapropelic shale above the Upper Seam represents a brackish lake.
   Numerous relationships are found between petrography-based facies indicators and the geochemical composition of organic matter. The contents of macerals of the liptinite group are positively correlated with soluble organic matter (SOM) yields and hydrogen index (HI). Consistent with maceral composition and high HI values, enhanced proportions of short-chain n-alkanes, which are predominantly found in algae and microorganisms, are obtained from samples of the sapropelic shales. The final drowning of the mire is reflected by decreasing pristane/phytane ratios, due to the rise in (ground)water table and the establishment of anaerobic conditions, as well as by decreasing ratios of diasterenes/sterenes, indicating increasing pH values in the mire. The degree of gelification of plant tissue (gelification index) is governed by the microbial activity in the mire, as indicated by the hopanes concentration. The differences in floral assemblage during the formation of the Lavanttal lignite seams are reflected by major differences in tissue preservation. Preservation of plant tissue (TPI) in the Lavanttal lignite is obviously controlled by the presence/absence of decay-resistant gymnosperms in the peat-forming vegetation, and additionally influenced by the relative contribution of wood to coal formation. The results provide evidence that valuable information for coal facies characterization could be obtained by petrography-based and geochemical facies indicators. An influence of the floral assemblage (gymnosperms/angiosperms ratio) and of the contribution of algal biomass on carbon isotopic composition of the organic matter (delta C-13 = -24.2 to -28.6%.) is proposed. Carbon cycling during biogeochemical decomposition of plant tissue by bacteria is suggested to affect the delta C-13 values of the coal, The chemotaxonomical classification of the xylites as gymnosperm remnants, based on the molecular composition of terpenoid biomarkers, is corroborated by the carbon isotopic composition of the xylites (mean delta C-13 = -24.1%) and the extracted cellulose (mean delta C-13 = -20.2%). The higher isotopic difference of about 3.9%. between cellulose and total organic carbon of the xylites, compared to the difference between cellulose and wood found in modem trees, is explained by the smaller effect of decomposition on delta C-13 of cellulose.

AB Localized ecohydrological feedbacks have been proposed as important internal drivers of patterns and processes in terrestrial ecosystems. However, there is a significant gap between the prominence of theoretical models and the paucity of observations describing linkages between ecosystem structure and functioning. Here we report empirical evidence for strong interactions between surface vegetation patterning and long-term carbon sequestration rates in four peat bogs in Patagonia on the basis of high-resolution stratigraphic analyses. Peatland development across the study region was characterized by repeated switches between wet-and dry-adapted plant communities, depicting changes between hollows (wet assemblages) and lawns (dry assemblages) that could represent past surface patterning. We found a site-specific relationship between the frequency of the wet-to-dry cycles and carbon accumulation rates that followed a power function, with rapid vegetation shifts causing high peat accumulation rates. Our results show strong evidence for internal regulation of vegetation dynamics and peatland growth, implying that understanding peatland processes is a prerequisite for peat-based paleoclimate reconstructions.

AB Natural peatlands are an important component of the global carbon cycle, representing a net long-term sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The natural carbon storage function of these ecosystems can be severely impacted due to Peatland drainage and peat extraction, leading to large and persistent sources of atmospheric CO2 following peat extraction abandonment. Standard restoration techniques aim to restore the peatland to a carbon-accumulating system through various water management techniques to improve hydrological conditions and through reintroducing Sphagnum at the surface. However, restoring the hydrology of peatlands can be expensive due to the cost of implementing the various restoration techniques. This study examines the net ecosystem CO2 exchange of a new extraction-restoration technique where the acrotelm is preserved and replaced directly on the cutover surface. Peat respiration at the experimental restored acrotelm (110.5 g C.m(-2) over the study period: May 20 - August 18) was significantly lower than at the natural peatland (144.8 and 203.7 g C.m(-2), wet and dry plots respectively). However, gross ecosystem production (GEP) at the experimental site was significantly reduced (-54.0 and -34.4 g C.m(-2)) compared to the natural site (-179.2 and -162.0 g C.m(-2)). Consequently, this was a growing season net emitter of CO2 to the atmosphere over the season at the experimental site (78.5 and 56.5 g C.m(-2)) and a growing season sink of CO2 at the natural site (-17.6 and -22.8 g C.m(-2)). Light response curves indicated that maximum GEP was significantly lower at the experimental site; however, it is likely that the percentage of living and dead vegetation at the plots post restoration had a large control on this lower productivity as plots with more living vegetation had higher overall productivity (GEP). Nevertheless, the experimental site did maintain limited productivity post-extraction, indicating that the carbon dynamics of the system was maintained due to this acrotelm restoration process, thereby likely returning the ecosystem toward a natural sink of atmospheric CO2 faster than natural rehabilitation and current restoration techniques. As such, this approach to peat extraction may be an environmentally preferred approach to use.

AB Cyclic peatland surface variability is influenced by hydrological conditions that highly depend on climate and/or anthropogenic activities. A low water level leads to a decrease of peatland surface and an increase of C emissions into the atmosphere, whereas a high water level leads to an increase of peatland surface and carbon sequestration in peatlands. The main aim of this article is to evaluate the influence of hydrometeorological conditions toward the peatland surface and its feedback toward the water regime. A regional survey of the raised bog water table fluctuation and surface variability was made in one of the largest peatlands in Lithuania. Two appropriate indicators for different peatland surface variability periods (increase and decrease) were detected. The first one is an similar to 200 mm y(-1) average net rainfall over a three-year range. The second one is an average annual water depth of 25-30 cm. The application of these indicators enabled the reconstruction of Cepkeliai peatland surface variability during a 100 year period. Processes of peatland surface variability differ in time and in separate parts of peatland. Therefore, internal subbasins in peatland are formed. Subbasins involve autogenic processes that can later affect their internal hydrology, nutrient status, and vegetation succession. Internal hydrological conditions, surface fluctuation, and vegetation succession in peatland subbasins should be taken into account during evaluation of their state, nature management projects, and other peatland research works.

AB The Orawa-Nowy Targ Basin is one of only a few areas in the Polish Carpathians with high relative cover of peatlands (12 %). This fraction is declining progressively due to several centuries of peat exploitation for fuel, gardening and balneology. The peatland at Ludimierz near Nowy Targ is regionally important for its high biodiversity but has been scarred by historical and contemporary peat extraction. The current area and fragmentation of peat domes on Ludimierz Bog were assessed, along with the characteristics and condition of the vegetation. Also, topographical changes across areas of peat extraction were analysed using a combination of remote sensing and field study methods in order to identify the locations of modern peat extraction and natural mass movements. The condition of the raised bog and changes in its boundaries were thus deduced, paying attention to the bog's exceptional environmental and landscape values. The area covered by the bog is currently 39 ha and it is divided into three separate domes which are drained by a network of ditches and through discontinuities of the water table at peat extraction areas. The vegetation on extraction areas currently has a higher biomass growth rate than the plant cover on the domes, and is in better condition on the basis of NDVI assessment.

AB At the Mer Bleue bog, Ontario, Canada, DOC export measured at the basin outflow was -8.3 +/- 3.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1), and DOC loading via precipitation was estimated to be 1.5 +/- 0.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Discharge and DOC export calculated using a Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation compared weil (within 1 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) to outflow estimates of DOC export. and confirmed that outflow measurements were a suitable proxy for DOC seepage at the peatland margins. DOC export was 12% of the magnitude of the residual carbon sink measured at the peatland. The [DOC] across groundwater transects decreased with depth, and [DOC] sampled below 0.75 m depths remained fairly constant over the study period. However, [DOC] exported through the acrotelm (0 to 0.45 m peat depth) was variable, ranging from 40 mg l(-1) after snowmelt to 70 mg l(-1) during the growing season. Fluorescence analysis revealed that exported DOC was 'allochthonous-like', whereas DOC in the catotelm (deeper layers of peat) became more 'autochthonous-like' with depth. A conceptual model is developed to summarize the hydrological processes and controls which affect DOC biogeochemistry at the Mer Bleue. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The ongoing warming in high-latitude regions may be causing rapid changes in the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Of particular concern is the fate of belowground soil organic carbon stored in peat-accumulating wetlands, as these large carbon pools are sensitive to temperature and moisture conditions. Despite their important role in the global carbon cycle, considerable uncertainty remains over the carbon balance of northern peatlands in a changing climate. Here we examine the response of vegetation and carbon dynamics in a wet boreal peatland to recent climate warming using empirical peat core data and a new modeling approach. We observed a widespread shift from herbaceous Carex fen peat to Sphagnum moss peat around 100 years ago that was accompanied by a sharp increase in carbon accumulation rate. The observed apparent carbon accumulation rates over the past 100 years (96.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) were almost 10 times greater than those over the past 4000 years (11.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Once differential decomposition history was considered using three modeling approaches, the expected long-term accumulation rate of recent peat was still 2-6 times greater than that of the past 4000 years. We propose that recent warming has led to Sphagnum establishment, which rapidly altered the peatland surface chemistry and hydrology, further promoting Sphagnum growth and enhancing the carbon sink capacity of this peatland. Longer and warmer growing seasons could also have stimulated plant growth. Our results imply that accelerated carbon accumulation under global warming in some wet peatlands might offset some of the carbon losses experienced from other peatland types.

AB Boreal peatland energy balances using the eddy covariance technique have previously been made in Alaska, Canada, Scandinavia, and Western Siberia, but not in the European portion of the Russian Federation. European Russia contains approximately 200,000 km(2) of peatlands and has a boreal (subarctic), continental climate influencing the region's energy balance. To help fill this research gap, the surface energy balance was determined for a boreal peatland fen in the Komi Republic of Russia for an 11-month period in 2008-2009 using the eddy covariance method. The total measurement period's cumulative energy balance closure rate was 86%, with higher closure during the critical summer growing season. Similar to other boreal peatland sites, the mid-summer shortwave radiation demonstrated albedo between 0.13 and 0.19 as calculated on a cumulative monthly basis, whereas monthly albedo was >0.9 during the months with greatest snow (January, February 2009). Mid-summer Bowen ratios averaged 0.20-0.25 on a cumulative basis, with monthly averaged mid-day values in the range 0.35-0.53 during the growing season. Latent energy (LE) fluxes exceeded 70% of net radiation and 60% of potential evapotranspiration. During the study period, total evapotranspiration (406 mm) was slightly greater than rainfall (389 mm), with later snowfalls creating excess moisture in the atmospheric water budget. These characteristics together point to a peatland whose energy balance behavior is generally consistent with data from other boreal fens. The LE fluxes were dominantly controlled by net radiation, with less canopy resistance than at other northern fens and a lighter role for vapor pressure deficit to play in the energy balance. The aerodynamic and canopy conductance terms were of similar magnitude, both through the season and through any given diurnal cycle. The consequently high decoupling coefficient (0.65 +/- 0.16 in the growing season) allows further modeling of fens in this region with reduced effects from the uncertainties of parameterizing surface conductance terms and their responses to water table and vapor pressure deficit changes. The Priestley-Taylor method provides a reasonable approach to modeling evapotranspiration, given some assumptions about the site's energy balance closure. This understanding of the local drivers on the energy and water budgets has important implications for peatland ecology and growth, regional carbon dynamics, and downstream hydrology.

AB Resource-access road crossings are expected to alter peatland hydrological properties by obstructing surface and sub-surface water flows. We conducted a multi-year study at two boreal peatlands - a forested bog and a shrubby rich fen near Peace River, Alberta - to study the impacts of resource access roads on the hydrology of adjacent peatland. Field measurements (bi-weekly depth to water table and hydraulic head, one-time hydraulic conductivity) during the growing seasons (May-August) of 2016 and 2017 were taken from sampling plots representing: 1) sides of the road (upstream and downstream); 2) distance from the road (obstruction); and 3) distance from culverts. Compared to the growing season average precipitation for the region of 1.8 mm d(-1), the study period had very wet conditions in 2016 (3.7 mm d(-1)) and dry conditions in 2017 (1.1 mm d(-1)).
   In contrast to our assumptions, resource access road disturbed the surface and sub-surface water flow at the bog, but the effect was minimal at the fen as the road orientation was nearly parallel to the flow direction at the latter. At the bog, the shallowest depth to water table position was observed at upstream areas closer to the road, when culverts were located > 20m distance from transects. In contrast, when culverts were present < 2m from the transects, variation in hydrological conditions between upstream and downstream areas were greatly reduced. Our work shows road effects on peatland hydrology could be minimized by aligning roads parallel to the water flow direction when possible. If water flow is perpendicular to the road, adequate spacing and installation of culverts could help to reduce flow obstruction.

AB Globally, peatlands play an important role in the carbon (C) cycle. High water level is a key factor in maintaining C storage in peatlands, but water levels are vulnerable to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. This review examines literature related to the effects of water level alteration on C cycling in peatlands to summarize new ideas and uncertainties emerging in this field. Peatland ecosystems maintain their function by altering plant community structure to adapt to changing water levels. Regarding primary production, woody plants are more productive in unflooded, well-aerated conditions, whileSphagnummosses are more productive in wetter conditions. The responses of sedges to water level alteration are species-specific. While peat decomposition is faster in unflooded, well aerated conditions, increased plant production may counteract the C loss induced by increased ecosystem respiration (ER) for a period of time. In contrast, rising water table maintains anaerobic conditions and enhances the role of the peatland as a C sink. Nevertheless, changes in DOC flux during water level fluctuation is complicated and depends on the interactions of flooding with environment. Notably, vegetation also plays a role in C flux but particular species vary in their ability to sequester and transport C. Bog ecosystems have a greater resilience to water level alteration than fens, due to differences in biogeochemical responses to hydrology. The full understanding of the role of peatlands in global C cycling deserves much more study due to uncertainties of vegetation feedbacks, peat-water interactions, microbial mediation of vegetation, wildfire, and functional responses after hydrologic restoration.

AB We evaluated the spatial heterogeneity of historical carbon accumulation rates in a forested, ombrotrophic bog in Minnesota to aid understanding of responses to an ongoing decade-long warming manipulation. Eighteen peat cores indicated that the bog has been accumulating carbon for over 11,000 years, to yield 176 +/- 40 kg C m(-2) to 225 +/- 58 cm of peat depth. Estimated peat basal ages ranged from 5100 to 11,100 cal BP. The long-term apparent rate of carbon accumulation over the entire peat profile was 22 +/- 2 kg C m(-2) yr(-1). Plot location within the study area did not affect carbon accumulation rates, but estimated basal ages were younger in profiles from plots closer to the bog lagg and farther from the bog outlet. In addition, carbon accumulation varied considerably over time. Early Holocene net carbon accumulation rates were 30 +/- 6 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Around 3300 calendar BP, net carbon accumulation rates dropped to 15 +/- 8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) until the last century when net accumulation rates increased again to 74 +/- 57 g C m(-2) yr(-1). During this period of low accumulation, regional droughts may have lowered the water table, allowing for enhanced aerobic decomposition and making the bog more susceptible to fire. These results suggest that experimental warming treatments, as well as a future warmer climate may reduce net carbon accumulation in peat in this and other southern boreal peatlands. Furthermore, our we caution against historical interpretations extrapolated from one or a few peat cores.

AB This study deals with the palaeohydrological information obtained from lipids composition and vegetal tissue preservation of two peat cores from Asturias, North Spain. The two profiles differ in the type of peatland (raised bog in La Borbolla and blanket bog in Buelna) and the type of organic matter being more bryophytic in the raised bog and more herbaceous in the blanket bog. The peatlands are located close to the coast on impermeable, old flat erosion surfaces which favoured peat accumulation within a distance of 3.5 km from each other. The accumulation rate varied between 0.05 and 0.07 mm/yr and the records extend from around 9000 to 2500 cal. yr BP.
   The main differences between the two peat sites can be summarized as follows: the raised bog has lower mineral matter content and H/C atomic ratio and higher C/N ratio and extraction yields compared to the blanket bog. It has also a higher Tissue Preservation Index for Huminite macerals and increasing Inertodetrinite Index with depth. Regarding biomarkers, the raised bog has a relatively higher concentration of n-alkane-2-ones compared to the corresponding n-alkane of similar carbon number, higher concentration of medium- vs. high-molecular weight -methyl-ketones and higher triterpenoids/steroids ratio than the blanket bog.
   Alternating humid/dry periods have been recorded in both profiles based on lipid concentrations indicating that the Sphagnum-rich intervals in the raised bog are more sensitive than the herbaceous blanket peat record to climatic variations. The main humid intervals identified are dated as 5000-7500 cal. yr BP in the blanket bog and as 6000-3500 cal. yr BP and last 2500 cal. yr BP in the raised bog and correlate with the humid periods traced in other peatlands locations in this region. The transition Middle-to-Late Holocene is characterized by humid conditions in the region which favoured the Sphagnum growth in the peats.
   The reflectance of huminite in these records appears to be more related with differences in the oxidative conditions than with variation of peat maturity. It is higher in the layers with high mineral matter content at the beginning of organic matter accumulation and also in the upper part of the profile subjected to seasonal desiccation. A more intense biochemical gelification coincides with higher concentration of hopanoids derived from bacteria in the upper part of the profile (acrotelm).
   High amount of nonadecan-2-one (K-19) and high concentrations of triterpenyl acetates, which are also determined in other peat profiles from Northern Spain are also detected in these profiles. This indicates that the specific conditions required for the formation of these compounds, probably associated to wet temperate climate, dominated throughout the region. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Properties of peat reflect the peat-forming environment, peat development processes and the types of peat-forming plant. They also enable peat classification and quality evalution. Investigation of the physicochemical properties of organic matter is the key to understanding the history, evolution and geology of bogs. The purpose of this study was to determine some physicochemical properties, such as pH, Eh, electrolytic conductivity, carbon forms in water extracts and dry peat samples (TOC, IC, TC), degree of decomposition, macrofossil plant analysis and ash content, in a whole stratigraphic profile of bog sediment located near Lake Moszne. The research comprised a 17.5 ha lake, which was described in the 1990s as a dystrophic one, and the adjacent mires. The open water surface of the lake is surrounded by a 30-150 m wide belt of floating mat, composed of peatmosses and sedges with the dominant Sphagno-Caricetum rostratae association, all representing vegetation typical for transitional mires. These communities are most often found in the Polesie Lubelskie Region, in old lakes, and usually on their floating mat. The research material was collected from such a site. The analysis demonstrated acidic pH (4.17 in profile I and 4.08 in profile II, respectively) in the layer of 0-0.65 m, whilst from the 1.50 in depth to the mineral bottom the pH increased to nearly neutral (pH = 6.62 +/- 0.18 in profile I and pH = 6.45 +/- 0.12 in profile II). Redox potential in the surface layer corresponds to good oxygenation of mineral soils: 577 mV and 490 mV for profile I and II, respectively. A nearly linear decrease of Eh was observed to about 118 mV at the depth of 2.50 m. Lower than that, down to the depth of 3.50 m, the Eh value was stabilized. The graphical presentation of the Eh-pH relationship shows that in both cases (profiles I and II) aerobiosis prevails to the depth of 0.45-0.65 m, confirming that oxygen continues to be the final electron acceptor.

AB Ecosystem respiration (carbon dioxide; CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes to the atmosphere were determined using an opaque closed chamber method within various ecotopes (vegetation covered, bare peat and open water) in a rewetted extracted peatland and within an adjacent open poor fen in Sweden. Ecotopes had a significant impact on CO2 and CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere. Ecosystem respiration and CH4 emissions from the bare peat site, the constructed shallow lake and the open poor fen were low but were much higher from ecotopes with Eriophorum vaginatum tussocks and Eriophorum angustifolium. A combination of vascular plant cover and high soil temperatures enhanced ecosystem respiration, while a combination of vascular plant cover, high water table levels and high soil temperatures enhanced CH4 emissions. N2O emissions contributed little to total greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes from the soil-plant-water systems to the atmosphere. However, the overall climate impact of CH4 emissions from the study area did not exceed the impact of soil and plant respiration. With regard to management of extracted peatlands, the construction of a nutrient-poor shallow lake showed great potential for lowering GHG fluxes to the atmosphere.

AB Bog vegetation, which is dominated by Sphagnum mosses, depends exclusively on aerial deposition of mineral nutrients. We studied how the main mineral nutrients are distributed between intracellular and extracellular exchangeable fractions and along the vertical physiological gradient of shoot age in seven Sphagnum species occupying contrasting bog microhabitats. While the Sphagnum exchangeable cation content decreased generally in the order Ca(2+) a parts per thousand yen K(+), Na(+), Mg(2+) > Al(3+) > NH(4) (+), intracellular element content decreased in the order N > K > Na, Mg, P, Ca, Al. Calcium occurred mainly in the exchangeable form while Mg, Na and particularly K, Al and N occurred inside cells. Hummock species with a higher cation exchange capacity (CEC) accumulated more exchangeable Ca(2+), while the hollow species with a lower CEC accumulated more exchangeable Na(+), particularly in dead shoot segments. Intracellular N and P, but not metallic elements, were consistently lower in dead shoot segments, indicating the possibility of N and P reutilization from senescing segments. The greatest variation in tissue nutrient content and distribution was between species from contrasting microhabitats. The greatest variation within microhabitats was between the dissimilar species S. angustifolium and S. magellanicum. The latter species had the intracellular N content about 40% lower than other species, including even this species when grown alone. This indicates unequal competition for N, which can lead to outcompeting of S. magellanicum from mixed patches. We assume that efficient cation exchange enables Sphagnum vegetation to retain immediately the cationic nutrients from rainwater. This may represent an important mechanism of temporal extension of mineral nutrient availability to subsequent slow intracellular nutrient uptake.

AB Peatlands are carbon-rich ecosystems that are extensive in the northern high latitudes where significant 21st century climate changes are expected. In response to climate change, peatlands may become a net source of greenhouse gases, thereby inducing a positive climate feedback effect. In this paper, the impact of precipitation variability and the mean climate state on long-term peat accumulation is investigated with model simulations. The models couple peat accumulation with the hydrological cycle, which results in peatland bistability, where peatlands may take the physical characteristics from one of two possible alternative stable states. The models consider precipitation as a stochastic forcing variable, temperature-dependent functions and are parameterized with climatology and peat characteristics to represent the West Siberian Lowlands (WSL) between 55 degrees N and 60 degrees N. Observed WSL peat depths statistically imply bistability. Peatland bistability, however, is eliminated in model simulations with moderate-to-large precipitation variability and warmer and wetter climates. This suggests that projected late 21st century climate change would put the thick peatlands in WSL on a transition to thin peatlands. The loss of thick peatlands could significantly increase atmospheric carbon dioxide and provide a positive climate feedback effect. However, the impacts depend on the importance of unaccounted stabilizing factors. The study also shows that precipitation variability induces peatlands to switch between extended periods of accumulation and depletion even if the peatlands are in long-term equilibrium. Thus, short-term observations may see only natural fluctuations and new, longer-term observational strategies are necessary to diagnose if peatlands are undergoing fundamental changes.

ID RETENTION; NEVADA
AB Persistently wet conditions are essential to prevent the decomposition of organic material that forms peatlands. Wetlands in areas with a snow-melt dominated precipitation regime and little or no summer precipitation often rely on groundwater to meet late-season water requirements. Past and predicted changes in climate for the Sierra Nevada show a trend towards more winter precipitation falling as rain rather than snow. This is expected to result in reduced late-season water availability and the subsequent degradation of peatlands. Measurements of groundwater levels, stream flow, specific conductance, and peat water retention characteristics are used to quantify aspects of the hydrologic system that supports Grass Lake, south of Lake Tahoe California, the largest peatland in the Sierra Nevada. Water budget calculations using periodic measurements collected throughout the growing season show that groundwater discharge is a significant component of the water balance in the late-summer and fall. Late-season evapotranspiration needs were approximately balanced by groundwater inflow for 2010 (average water year). Groundwater discharge to the peatland dominated the late-season water budget in 2011 (above average water year) and persisted into October. Water retention experiments and field data suggest desaturation of the peatland accounts for approximately 0.5 mm day(-1), or roughly 10 % of the estimated evapotranspiration rate.

AB The sloping flanks of peatlands are commonly patterned with non-random, contour-parallel stripes of distinct micro-habitats such as hummocks, lawns and hollows. Patterning seems to be governed by feedbacks among peatland hydrological processes, plant micro-succession, plant litter production and peat decomposition. An improved understanding of peatland patterning may provide important insights into broader aspects of the long-term development of peatlands and their likely response to future climate change.
   We recreated a cellular simulation model from the literature, as well as three subtle variants of the model, to explore the controls on peatland patterning. Our models each consist of three submodels, which simulate: peatland water tables in a gridded landscape, micro-habitat dynamics in response to water-table depths, and changes in peat hydraulic properties.
   We found that the strength and nature of simulated patterning was highly dependent on the degree to which water tables had reached a steady state in response to hydrological inputs. Contrary to previous studies, we found that under a true steady state the models predict largely unpatterned landscapes that cycle rapidly between contrasting dry and wet states, dominated by hummocks and hollows, respectively. Realistic patterning only developed when simulated water tables were still transient.
   Literal interpretation of the degree of hydrological transience required for patterning suggests that the model should be discarded; however, the transient water tables appear to have inadvertently replicated an ecological memory effect that may be important to peatland patterning. Recently buried peat layers may remain hydrologically active despite no longer reflecting current vegetation patterns, thereby highlighting the potential importance of three-dimensional structural complexity in peatlands to understanding the two-dimensional surface-patterning phenomenon.
   The models were highly sensitive to the assumed values of peat hydraulic properties, which we take to indicate that the models are missing an important negative feedback between peat decomposition and changes in peat hydraulic properties. Understanding peatland patterning likely requires the unification of cellular landscape models such as ours with cohort-based models of long-term peatland development.

However, knowledge of the development of mountain peatlands and the past distribution of wetland plants is poorly documented. Here we used high-resolution, contiguous plant macrofossils analysis of two distinct cores taken from central and marginal parts of a small mountain peatland (Poiana Stiol) in the Eastern Carpathians and provide a long-term reconstruction of local vegetation dynamics. We distinguished several phases of peatland development, including: lake stage, rich fen and poor fen. Numerous Potamogeton species, Batrachium sp. and Chara sp. were the pioneer plants of a shallow eutrophic lake. Plant succession in central and marginal parts of peatland proceeds in a different way. After a fen stage cyclic succession, various species of Sphagnum and Eriophorum vaginatum were documented in both cores. However, between ca. 7700 and 4700 cal yr BP Sphagnum magellanicum, Sphagnum angushfolium and E. vaginatum alternately dominated the local plant community in the central part of the peatland. In contrast, an alternating dominance of Sphagnum russowii, S. magellanicum, S. angusdfolium and E. vaginatum was observed during the last 1200 years in the marginal part of the site. These variable successions of Sphagnum species and E. vaginatum appear to primarily be a result of climate changes and autogenic processes in peatland vegetation. Fossil remains of several rare and endangered species presently considered as glacial relicts in Southern Europe, e.g. Paludella squarrosa and Meesia triquetra, were discovered for the first time in this part of Europe.

AB The hydrology of Quebec, Canada, boreal fens is poorly documented. Many peatlands are located in watersheds with impounded rivers. In such cases, their presence influences reservoir inflows. In recent years, some fens have been subjected to an increase of their wet area, a sign that they may be evolving towards an aquatic ecosystem. This dynamic process is called aqualysis. This article presents the seasonal and monthly hydrological budgets of a small watershed including a highly aqualysed fen (James Bay region). The monitoring of precipitation (P), runoff (Q) and groundwater levels (WL) was conducted during the ice-free season. Three semiempirical equations (Thornthwaite, PriestleyTaylor and PenmanMonteith) were used and compared to calculate potential evapotranspiration. The first two equations, having fewer parameters, estimate higher potential evapotranspiration values than the third equation. The use of pressure-level gauges installed in wells, for the calculation of peatland water storage, is inconclusive. Swelling of peat, peat decomposition and plant composition could be responsible for nonnegligible amounts of absorbed water, which are not entirely accounted for by well levels. The estimation of peat matrix water storage is potentially the largest source of error and the limiting factor to calculate water balances in this environment. The results show that the groundwater level and the water storage vary depending on the season and especially after a heavy rainfall. Finally, the results illustrate the complexity of water routing through the site and thus raise several questions to be resolved in the future. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Peatlands are natural ecosystems that provide archives of the hydrological cycle, ecological processes and terrestrial carbon dynamics. In the north-central region of Quebec (eastern Canada), patterned peatlands developed in topographic depressions of the Precambrian Shield following the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreat. These peatlands display characteristics similar to appa mires and other peatlands that developed at the ecotone between the open (taiga) and closed boreal forest biomes of the Northern Hemisphere, and also correspond to the biogeographic limit between ombrotrophic and minerotrophic peatlands. During the Neoglacial cooling period in northeastern Canada, patterned peatlands, mainly oligotrophic fens, registered a hydrological disequilibrium expressed by an increase in surface wetness as aquatic microforms expanded to the detriment of terrestrial surfaces. Ecohydrological trajectories were reconstructed from a detailed study of two patterned peatlands in order to document their sensitivity to climate variations. To do this, plant macrofossil and testate amoeba data were combined with peat carbon accumulation rates, C:N ratios, <SUP>210</SUP>Pb and <SUP>14</SUP>C chronologies. Data show that peatlands initiated ca 6500 cal. y BP as ombrotrophic or minerotrophic systems depending on site-specific conditions, followed by a general increase in surface wetness during the Neoglacial cooling until the end of the Little Ice Age. A relatively synchronous ecosystem state shift from oligotrophic to more ombrotrophic conditions was registered at the beginning of the 20th century in central and lateral cores of both study sites, evoking the likely influence of recent warming on peat accumulation. These results suggest a potential northward migration of the biogeographic limit of the ombrotrophic peatland distribution during the 20th century, which could have implications for the role of these ecosystems as C sinks at the continental scale. Overall, these peatlands have stored a mean carbon mass of ca 100 kg m<SUP>- <SUP>2</SUP></SUP>.

AB This paper reports on patterns in plant-mediated processes that determine the rate of nutrient cycling in temperate fens and bogs. We linked leaf-level nutrient dynamics with leaf-litter decomposition and explored how the observed patterns were reflected in nutrient cycling at the ecosystem level. Comparisons were made among growth forms (evergreen and deciduous shrubs and trees, graminoids and Sphagnum mosses) and between mire types (fens and bogs). A literature review showed that the predominant growth form was more important as a determinant of leaf-level nutrient-use efficiency (NUE) than mire type (fen vs. bog). Evergreens had the highest N and P use efficiency. The growth form differences in NUE were mainly determined by differences in N and P concentrations in mature leaves and not by differences in resorption efficiency from senescing leaves. Sphagnum leaves had lower N and P concentrations than the other growth forms, but because of a lack of data on nutrient resorption efficiency the NUE of these mosses could not be calculated. Nitrogen use efficiency did not differ among fen and bog species, whereas bog species had a higher P use efficiency than fen species. However, a complete evaluation of mire-type or growth-form effects on NUE is only possible when data become available about nutrient resorption from senescing Sphagnum leaves. As leaf-level NUE is negatively correlated with leaf-litter nutrient concentrations, then is a direct link between NUE and litter decomposition rate.
   Rates of litter decomposition of Sphagnum mosses are lower than in the other growth forms, but there is still much speculation about possible reasons. The role of litter chemistry of Sphagnum mosses (including decay inhibitors and decay-resistant compounds) in decomposition especially warrants further study. The strongly deviating nutritional ecology of Sphagnum mosses clearly distinguishes fens and bogs from other ecosystems. Moreover, N and P concentrations in mature leaves from vascular plant species from fens and bogs are in almost all cases lower and leaf-level N use efficiency is higher than in species from other ecosystems, irrespective of the growth form considered.
   Both literature data and data from a comparative study on soil nutrient cycling in temperate fens and bogs in the United States (Maryland), The Netherlands, and Poland showed that nutrient mineralization did not differ clearly between fens and bogs. The comparative study further showed that cellulose decomposition in bogs was lower than in fens and that nutrient mineralization was higher in forested than in herbaceous mires. The occurrence of dominant growth forms was clearly related to soil nutrient-cycling processes, and observed patterns were in agreement with patterns in the components of NUE as found in the literature study. We conclude that a protocol with standardized procedures for measuring various nutrient-cycling process rates that is used by scientists in various wetland types and geographical regions is a useful tool for unravelling large-scale patterns in soil nutrient-cycling processes in wetlands and for linking plant-mediated nutrient dynamics with ecosystem nutrient-cycling processes.

AB Fluxes of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and respired CO2 were measured with an automated chamber system (SIGMA) over the autumn of 2009 and growing season of 2010 in an undisturbed peatland with a floating carpet of mosses in western Poland. The main goal of our investigation was to deliver estimations of CH4 and N2O emission rates for this unique peatland type in Central Europe. CO2 and CH4 fluxes were also measured using a non-steady-state-flow-through manual chamber systems equipped with infrared gas analyzers and used to validate and adjust results obtained with the SIGMA system. The average methane fluxes for the 2009-2010 (excluding winter) period was 95.4 (+/- 32.4) mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) resulting in a cumulative CH4 emission of 23.4 (+/- 2.4) g CH4-C m(-2) A day growing season and 29.2 (+/- 3.2) g CH4-C m(-2) year(-1) for the whole of 2010. The average seasonal N2O fluxes were 13.6 (+/- 28.2) mu g N2O-N m(-2) d(-1). N2O fluxes were highly variable in time and sign (both uptake and emissions of N2O were observed during the accumulation periods). Maximum estimates of the annual emission rates of N2O were 0.004 g N2O-N m(-2) year(-1). Methane fluxes correlated significantly with the air and peat temperatures, but they were not dependent on water table depth. The N2O fluxes did not demonstrate a clear response to any environmental variables. Both CH4 and N2O emission rates were in the range of fluxes recorded in pristine peatlands in other climatic zones.

AB Carbon dioxide emissions and the mass loss of peat incubated in situ were measured in peat soils in the Australian Alps. The carbon chemistry of incubated peats was characterized using C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In situ decomposition decreased as a function of increasing alkyl carbon content of the initial organic matter, providing direct evidence of the oft-cited link between substrate quality and decomposition rates. More mass loss occurred in the bog peat samples than in the dried peat samples. However, at the peat surface, the amount of CO2 emitted was not significantly different between bog peat and dried peat. Carbon inputs, and therefore the sink or source status, of these peats are yet to be quantified.

AB Although ombrotrophic temperate peatlands are important ecosystems for maintaining biodiversity in eastern North America, the environmental factors influencing their flora are only partly understood. The relationships between plant species distribution and environmental factors were thus studied within the oldest temperate peatland of Quebec. Plant assemblages were identified by cluster analysis while CCA was used to related vegetation gradients to environmental factors. Five assemblages were identified; three typical of open bog and two characterized by more minerotrophic vegetation. Thicker peat deposit was encounter underlying the bog assemblages while higher water table level and percentage of free surface water distinguished the minerotrophic assemblages. Overall, the floristic patterns observed were spatially structured along the margins and the expanse. The most important environmental factors explaining this spatial gradient were the percentage of free surface water and the highest water-table level. To cite this article: S. Pellerin et al., C R.

AB We document a two-year experimental trial of a recently-developed integrated peat-harvesting and reclamation technique at a poor fen in northern Ontario, Canada. We removed and conserved the uppermost similar to 0.3 m of peat in blocks while deeper peat was harvested from the resultant pit. We allowed the extraction pit to flood with shallow groundwater, and then reclaimed the conserved surficial peat blocks by transplanting them into the flooded pit where they formed a low, floating mat. In the 2nd year after harvest average Sphagnum cover in our experimental plot was intermediate (similar to 25 %) between hummocks (similar to 100 %) and hollows (similar to 10 %) at an adjacent unharvested reference plot. Mean rates of Sphagnum productivity were greater in the experimental plot (65-86 g m(-2) month(-1)) than in the reference plot (45-55 g m(-2) month(-1)) for both hummock (S. fuscum) and lawn (S. magellanicum) species, although not significantly so, indicating that the transplant had no adverse effects on Sphagnum health. The inundated soil conditions in the trial pit prevented the large carbon dioxide emissions that are characteristic of many harvested peatlands. During the second growing season midday net ecosystem exchange at the experimental plot was similar to that at hollows in the reference plot. However, the anoxic soil conditions in the experimental plot led to highly elevated methane emissions in both years. Our results demonstrate that the method can enable rapid re-establishment of a healthy Sphagnum mat and carbon dioxide sequestration function in harvested peatlands, although the global warming potential of our experimental trial was high due to elevated methane emissions.

AB Even if mires have proven to be relatively reliable archives over the temporal trends in atmospheric mercury deposition, there are large discrepancies between sites regarding the magnitude of the anthropogenic contribution to the global mercury cycle. A number of studies have also revealed significant differences in mercury accumulation within the same mire area. This raises the question of which factors, other than mercury deposition, affect the sequestration of this element in peat. One such factor could be vegetation type, which has the potential to affect both interception and retention of mercury. In order to assess how small-scale differences in vegetation type can affect mercury sequestration we sampled peat and living plants along three transects on a northern Swedish mire. The mire has two distinctly different vegetation types, the central part consists of an open area dominated by Sphagnum whereas the surrounding fen, in addition to Sphagnum mosses, has an understory of micaceous shrubs and a sparse pine cover. A few main patterns can be observed in our data; (1) Both peat and Sphagnum-mosses have higher mercury content (both concentration and inventory) in the pine-covered fen compared to the open Sphagnum area (100% and 71% higher for peat and plants, respectively). These differences clearly exceed the 33% difference observed for lead-210, which is considered as a good analogue for atmospheric mercury deposition. (2) The differences in mercury concentration between peat profiles within a single vegetation type can largely be attributed to differences in peat decomposition. (3) When growing side by side in the open Sphagnum area, the moss species Sphagnum subsecundum has significantly higher mercury concentrations compared to S. centrale (24 +/- 3 and 18 +/- 2 ng Hg g(-1), respectively). Based on these observations we suggest that species composition, vegetation type and decomposition can affect the mercury sequestration in a peat record, and that any changes in these properties over time, or space, have the potential to modify the mercury deposition signal recorded in the peat.

AB Multiple proxies from a 319-cm peat core collected from the Hudson Bay Lowlands, northern Ontario, Canada were analyzed to determine how carbon accumulation has varied as a function of paleohydrology and paleoclimate. Testate amoeba assemblages, analysis of peat composition and humification, and a pollen record from a nearby lake suggest that isostatic rebound and climate may have influenced peatland growth and carbon dynamics over the past 6700 cal yr BP. Long-term apparent rates of carbon accumulation ranged between 8.1 and 36.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (average = 18.9 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The highest carbon accumulation estimates were recorded prior to 5400 cal yr BP when a fen existed at this site, however following the fen-to-bog transition carbon accumulation stabilized. Carbon accumulation remained relatively constant through the Neoglacial period after 2400 cal yr BP when pollen-based paleoclimate reconstructions from a nearby lake (McAndrews et al., 1982) and reconstructions of the depth to the water table derived from testate amoeba data suggest a wetter climate. More carbon accumulated per unit time between 1000 and 600 cal yr BP, coinciding in part with the Medieval Climate Anomaly. (c) 2012 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The fenland form of Liparis loeselii is currently known from only three sites in eastern England, having been lost from about 30 former localities since the start of the nineteenth century. The reason for in loss is sometimes uncertain: but in only a small number of instances can it be attributed confidently to drainage. The habitat of the current Liparis populations, all in the Norfolk Broadland, can be summarized as 'base-rich, wet. low-fertility, herbaceous fen'. Vegetation management, usually summer mowing, helps maintain the relatively low-growing; herbaceous vegetation that the orchid requires. In addition, all localities are in reflooded turbaries, the plant growing on a relatively buoyant mat of vegetation. Many former Liparis localities were apparently of similar character. Demographic studies on tagged plants in ten permanent plots in one population (Sutton Fen) between 1983 and 1990 showed that individuals were mostly short-lived but developed quickly. Small (young) individuals had particularly high mortalities and the majority died without flowering; individuals frequently. but not invariably, increased their leaf dimensions in successive years; flowering was almost entirely restricted to 2-leaved plants, especially robust individuals, and most flowering individuals re-appeared in the next growing season. The main period of emergence was between mid-June and mid-July, though some individuals that emerged in mid-June disappeared by mid-July (apparently due to mollusc grazing). The number of plants in the population showed considerable flux (though not all plots showed the same trends). A peak of numbers in some plots in 1986 and 1987 (due to both high rates of recruitment and low mortality) was followed by a crash in 1988 and 1990. This affected the entire population (1990 numbers were about one third of those in 1983) but was particularly evident in plots which had shown an earlier strong increase in numbers. The population peak occurred after a winter burn and may hale occurred in response to this. The cause of the subsequent decline is not known with certainty but it was associated with lack of vegetation management, low fen water levels (lack of surface inundation) at the time of emergence of Liparis plants and mollusc gazing damage. The effects of these events are difficult to disentangle, but gazing damage, perhaps facilitated by lack of shallow flooding at the time of shoot emergence, may be the proximate cause of loss. The short-lived character of many Liparis individuals and the quite rapid population turnover suggests that effective conservation management must provide conditions suitable for recruitment of new individuals as well as the maintenance of established plants, but the character of suitable regeneration niches is not well understood. It is possible thatperpetuation of Liparis populations may require some disturbance (perhaps winter burning or light trampling) as well as mowing. Rejuvenation of the hydrosere, by further pear removal, may be another long-term requirement. (C) 1998 The Linnean Society of London.

AB Northern peatlands are a diverse group of ecosystems varying along a continuum of hydrological, chemical, and vegetation gradients. These ecosystems contain about one third of the global soil carbon pool, but it is uncertain how carbon and water cycling processes and response to climate change differ among peatland types. This study examines midsummer CO2 and H2O fluxes measured using the eddy covariance technique above seven northern peatlands including a low-shrub bog, two open poor fens, two wooded moderately rich fens, and two open extreme-rich fens. Gross ecosystem production and ecosystem respiration correlated positively with vegetation indices and with each other. Consequently, 24-hour net ecosystem CO2 exchange was similar among most of the sites (an average net carbon sink of 1.5 +/- 0.2 g C m(-2) d(-1)) despite large differences in water table depth, water chemistry, and plant communities. Evapotranspiration was primarily radiatively driven at all sites but a decline in surface conductance with increasing water vapor deficit indicated physiological restrictions to transpiration, particularly at the peatlands with woody vegetation and less at the peatlands with 100% Sphagnum cover. Despite these differences, midday evapotranspiration ranged only from 0.21 to 0.34 mm h(-1) owing to compensation among the factors controlling evapotranspiration. Water use efficiency varied among sites primarily as a result of differences in productivity and plant functional type. Although peatland classification includes a great variety of ecosystem characteristics, peatland type may not be an effective way to predict the magnitude and characteristics of midsummer CO2 and water vapor exchanges.

AB Peat deposits contain on the order of 1/6 of the Earth's terrestrial fixed carbon (C), but uncertainty in peat depth precludes precise estimates of peat C storage. To assess peat C in the Northern Highlands Lake District (NHLD), a similar to 7000 km(2) region in northern Wisconsin, United States, with 20% peatland by area, we sampled 21 peatlands. In each peatland, peat depth (including basal organic lake sediment, where present) was measured on a grid and interpolated to calculate mean depth. Our study addressed three questions: (1) How spatially variable is peat depth? (2) To what degree can mean peat depth be predicted from other field measurements (water chemistry, water table depth, vegetation cover, slope) and/or remotely sensed spatial data? (3) How much C is stored in NHLD peatlands? Site mean peat depth ranged from 0.1 to 5.1 m. Most of the peatlands had been formed by the in-filling of small lake basins (terrestrialization), and depths up to 15 m were observed. Mean peat depth for small peat basins could be best predicted from basin edge slope at the peatland/upland interface, either measured in the field or calculated from digital elevation (DEM) data (Adj. R(2) = 0.70). Upscaling using the DEM-based regression gave a regional mean peat depth of 2.1 +/- 0.2 m (including similar to 0.1-0.4 m of organic lake sediment) and 144 +/- 21 Tg-C in total. As DEM data are widely available, this technique has the potential to improve C storage estimates in regions with peatlands formed primarily by terrestrialization.

AB A high-resolution (decade time-resolution) analysis of pollen from Ayameshitsugen Mire (750 m a.s.l.), Hokkaido, Japan, focused on vegetation response to climate change during the last glacial-interglacial transition. The succession analyzed covers the 14,050-8450 cal BP interval. Pollen records indicate that the area around the study site was occupied by boreal Betula-Picea-Abies forest during the late glacial period. Picea began to decrease at 11,600 cal BP and disappeared at 11,000 cal BP. Temperate forest elements began to increase about 100 years after the beginning of the decrease in Picea. Changing pollen assemblages over the early Holocene 11,600-8450 cal BP interval indicate that vegetation has not been in equilibrium with climate since the onset of Holocene conditions. Higher abundance of Ulmus and Juglans than at present characterizes early Holocene vegetation. A distinct cooling event coinciding with the Younger Dryas stade in the region only occurred 12,700-12,450 cal BP. The stade was less pronounced than in the North Atlantic region, and a gradual increase in Picea and Betula during the stade indicates gradual climatic amelioration in the region. Mire vegetation did not show a simultaneous response to the onset of Holocene warming. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB The transfer of Cs-137 and K-40 from soil to vegetation was studied in an Atlantic blanket bog ecosystem along the Atlantic coast of Ireland where the dominant vegetation is a mixture of Calluna vulgaris, Eriophorum vaginatum and Sphagnum mosses. The impact of soil chemistry and nutritional status of vegetation on the uptake of both radionuclides was also examined. Cesium-137 transfer factors values ranged from 1.9 to 9.6 and accumulation of Cs-137 was higher in the leaves of C. vulgaris than in the stems. Transfer factors values for Cs-137 in both C. vulgaris and E. vaginatum were similar indicating that for the vegetation studied, uptake is not dependent on plant species. The uptake of Cs-137 in bog vegetation was found to be positively correlated with the nutrient status of vegetation, in particular the secondary nutrients, calcium and magnesium. Potassium-40 transfer factors ranged from 0.9 to 13.8 and uptake was higher in E. vaginatum than in C. vulgaris, however, unlike Cs-137, the concentrations of K-40 within the leaves and stems of C. vulgaris were similar. The concentration of both Cs-137 and K-40 found in moss samples were in general lower than those found in vascular plants.

AB This paper documents the first 10,000 year old plant macrofossil record of vegetation changes on the central island of Santa Cruz, providing information on Sphagnum bog vegetation patterns, local extinction of key taxa, and temporal successions in the Galapagos humid highlands. Vegetation change is reconstructed through examination of Holocene sedimentary sequences obtained from three Sphagnum bogs located within volcanic caldera forming the high elevation central ridge system of Santa Cruz Island. Results indicate that these specialized Sphagnum bog ecosystems are dynamic and have undergone considerable changes in vegetation composition, transitioning from diverse hygrophilous herbs and submerged aquatic ecosystems to drier Sphagnum/Pteridium bog systems, during the last 10,000 cal yr BP. Additionally a new aquatic genus previously undocumented on the islands, Elatine, was discovered at two of the study sites, but it is now extinct on the archipelago. Some of the observed vegetation successions may have been driven by climatic shifts occurring within the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP). Other drivers including anthropogenic change are also considered significant over the last hundred years, placing strain on this naturally dynamic system. This study helps reveal patterns of change in the humid highlands over the last 10,000 cal yr BP regarding vegetation variability, climatic shifts, the historical influence of fire, tortoise disturbance, and recent anthropogenic impacts on the island.

AB Ground penetrating radar (GPR) and terrain conductivity measurements reveal a close correlation between the location of water-filled pools and stratigraphic/lithologic features in Caribou Bog, a 2200-hectare peatland in central Maine. The geophysical profiles, supported by coring, define the general peatland stratigraphy as till underlain by glacio-marine sediment overlain by organic-rich lake sediment transitioning into terrestrial peat. GPR measurements show that open pools coincide with abrupt thinning of lake sediment and glaciomarine clay such that elevated mineral soil surfaces are in direct contact with the base of terrestrial peat. The width of these features, the GPR reflection patterns, the anomalously low terrain conductivity and the core samples obtained support the interpretation of these elevated mineral surfaces as the extension of buried eskers that outcrop on the periphery of Caribou bog. The geophysical results indicate that two parallel esker ridges are orientated N-S and dip towards the south. We suggest that the distribution of open pools is related to the distribution of depressions and beads associated with a beaded esker deposit, the pools possibly being maintained by local groundwater flow cells associated with the esker.
   GPR and EM31 surveys across Sphagnum pools (defined here as Sphagnum filled wet depressions) suggest a continuous sequence of underlying lake sediment and glacio-marine deposits devoid of elevated mineral surfaces. We suggest that Sphagnum pools developed after peatland formation (secondary features) due to changes in water table, peat accumulation and/or climatic controls. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Glacial relict populations at the rear-edge of species' distributions are expected to respond dramatically to climate warming, yet very few studies have compared their conservation status in current refugia. Here we combine population genetics with species distribution modelling to assess patterns and causes of extinction or persistence in two cold-adapted species, Salty hastata and Juncus balticus, which survived post-glacial retractions in calcareous fens of the Iberian Peninsula. In both species, we detected extremely-low genetic diversity and clonal strategies in red-listed populations of the most Marginal region (Cantabrian Range), but high genetic diversity linked with sexual reproduction in populations from a less marginal region of the rear edge (Pyrenees). Genetic patterns were partially explained by past and present species climatic niches, more remarkably in the arctic-alpine S. hastata than in the boreo-atlantic J. balticus, suggesting different biogeographic history but similar sensitivity to global change. Our results show different magnitudes of extinction debt in regional populations that have survived in mountain refugia since the Last Glacial Maximum. Functional extinction of the most marginal populations can be explained by postglacial climate change and the historical decline of mire habitats. In contrast with the current trend of predicting future effects of climate change, we highlight that glacial relict populations might be currently going into extinction in climatically marginal regions. These populations can provide valuable information about the processes involved in species extinctions, improving our capacity to anticipate the effect of global change across regions and habitats.

ID CONSERVATION; DESIGN; EXTINCTION; HABITAT
AB optimization of resource use is necessary for efficient conservation planning. Many reserve-selection algorithms aim to identify representative but inexpensive networks, which may lead to selecting small sites due to their lower costs and collectively higher species richness. Nevertheless, larger sites would be preferable regarding species' long-term persistence. An area-based refinement can be used to overcome this problem. We used a reserve-planning framework in which continuous benefit functions valued representation (numbers of populations), and differential species weights were based on a species' local rarity and threatened status. We introduced a refinement based on the species-area relationship that provides relatively higher values for larger sites. We applied the proposed method to rich fen vegetation in southern Finland. The species-area refinement resulted in a network of significantly larger sites with minor trade-offs with representation (numbers of populations). Giving endangered species higher weights ensured that the trade-off occurred mostly between site size and representation of low-priority species. We recommend using a species-area refinement for practical, maximum-coverage conservation planning.

AB This study brings together plot-scale growing season fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from six Canadian peatlands restored by the moss layer transfer technique (MLTT) and compares them with fluxes from adjacent unrestored and natural peatlands to determine: 1) if CO2 and CH4 fluxes return to natural-site levels and 2) whether the ecohydrological controls (e.g. water table, plant cover) on these fluxes are similar between treatments. We also examine differences between eastern (humid/maritime climate) and western (sub-humid climate) Canadian plots, and between restoration of former horticultural peat extraction sites and oil industry well-pads. Our results indicate that restored site fluxes of CO2 and CH4 are not significantly different between eastern and western Canada or between a restored well-pad and restored horticultural peat extraction sites. Restoration resulted in gross primary production rates similar to those at natural plots and significantly greater than those at unrestored plots. Ecosystem respiration was not significantly different at restored and unrestored plots, and was lower at both than at natural plots. Methane emission was significantly greater at restored plots than at unrestored plots, but remained significantly lower on average than at natural plots. Water table was a significant control on CH4 flux across restored and natural plots. Vascular plant cover was significantly related to CO2 uptake (gross photosynthesis) at restored and unrestored plots, but not at natural plots, while higher moss cover resulted in significantly greater net uptake of CO2 at natural plots but not at restored and unrestored plots. Overall, MLTT restoration greatly alters CO2 and CH4 dynamics compared to unrestored areas but fluxes remain, on average, significantly different from those in natural peatlands, in both the magnitude of mean growing season fluxes and controls on variation in these fluxes among plots. Peatland restoration by MLTT results in reduced CO2 emissions and higher CH4 emissions; however, more year-round measurements in more restored peatlands over longer periods post-restoration are needed to improve greenhouse gas emission estimates for restored Canadian peatlands.

ID SEQUESTRATION
AB A recent paper by Heinemeyer et al. (2018) in this journal has suggested that the use of prescribed fire may enhance carbon accumulation in UK upland blanket bogs. We challenge this finding based on a number of concerns with the original manuscript including the lack of an unburned control, insufficient replication, unrecognised potential confounding factors, and potentially large inaccuracies in the core dating approach used to calculate carbon accumulation rates. We argue that burn-management of peatlands is more likely to lead to carbon loss than carbon gain. e00075

AB Plant species revegetation of hoof prints in a calcareous fen pasture and of artificially created hoof-print like gaps in an abandoned fen was investigated over two years and compared with the surrounding vegetation. The investigation of abiotic conditions showed that two hoof-print zones had to be distinguished: the steep, drained edge with good light conditions and the flat, dark, but wet bottom. Vegetative spreading and seedling recruitment were examined separately. After two years, hoof prints were not recolonized reasonably, indicating that both hoof-print zones did not offer good conditions for recolonization. Occurrence of frequent species and species numbers were similar in hoof prints, in the surrounding vegetation and in the seed bank. For many fen species germination from the seed bank was better in water-logged pots than in regularly-watered pots. Most species recolonized hoof prints both generatively and vegetatively. In the bottom zone more species germinated than spread vegetatively, but many seedlings died. At the edge, vegetative spreaders finally dominated in spite of high germination rates, because seedling mortality was also high. Overall, recolonization on the edges was more successful than on the bottom, probably because of better light conditions. Only few new species occurred inside hoof prints and only few species were frequent in hoof prints, but not in the surrounding vegetation. Those species were exclusively prostrate species germinating on the edges. The number of recolonizing species did not differ between pasture and abandoned site. Germination, however, was more severely limited in the abandoned fen due to low light availability, litter accumulation and competition by mosses. Altogether, our results show that the presumed importance of hoof prints for species recruitment has to be reconsidered for fen vegetation. On wet peat soil negative effects of soil compaction and changed water and light availability probably prevail over positive effects such as the promotion of subordinate species.

AB Peatlands are effective carbon sinks as more biomass is produced than decomposed under the prevalent anoxic conditions. Draining peatlands coupled with warming releases stored carbon, and subsequent rewetting may or may not restore the original carbon sink. Yet, patterns of plant production and decomposition in rewetted peatlands and how they compare to drained conditions remain largely unexplored. Here, we measured annual above- and belowground biomass production and decomposition in three different drained and rewetted peatland types: alder forest, percolation fen and coastal fen during an exceptionally dry year. We also used standard plant material to compare decomposition between the sites, regardless of the decomposability of the local plant material. Rewetted sites showed higher root and shoot production in the percolation fen and higher root production in the coastal fen, but similar root and leaf production in the alder forest. Decomposition rates were generally similar in drained and rewetted sites, only in the percolation fen and alder forest did aboveground litter decompose faster in the drained sites. The rewetted percolation fen and the two coastal sites had the highest projected potential for organic matter accumulation. Roots accounted for 23-66% of total biomass production, and belowground biomass, rather than aboveground biomass, was particularly important for organic matter accumulation in the coastal fens. This highlights the significance of roots as main peat-forming element in these graminoid-dominated fen peatlands and their crucial role in carbon cycling, and shows that high biomass production supported the peatlands' function as carbon sink even during a dry year.

AB Question: Recognizing water table dynamics in wetlands is crucial for understanding species-environment relationships, ecosystem function and changes during restoration. The PVC tape discolouration method enables spatially and temporally extensive studies of reductive conditions associated with longterm water table dynamics in peat soils. The reliability of the method has been verified only for ombrotrophic bogs, even though wide usage can be expected in minerotrophic fens. Location: Trebon basin, Czech Republic.
   Methods: Using data from 49 plots in six poor and moderately rich fens, we correlated the directly measured lowest, highest and mean water table depths and the same variables indicated by discolouration of PVC tape attached to green bamboo stakes installed vertically in the soil profile.
   Results: The depth to the first sign of PVC discolouration was highly correlated with the directly measured position of the highest water table, the correlation between the depth of complete discolouration and the directly measured position of the lowest water table was poorer. The accuracy of the minimum water table measurement depended on the depth of the peat layer. Surprisingly, the depth at which the green bamboo stakes turned brown correlated highly with the minimum water table.
   Conclusions: The PVC tape discolouration method reliably indicates water table maxima in fens, but minima are not accurately indicated. The depth of the green bamboo discolouration is suggested as a new alternative indicator of the minimum water table, even in fens and mineral soils. Combining both methods enables efficient monitoring of water table dynamics at a large number of mire sites.

AB Peatland soils play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle due to their high organic carbon content. Lowering of the water table e.g. for agricultural use accelerates aerobic secondary peat decomposition and processes of earthification. Peatlands change from C sinks to C sources. We characterized soil organic matter (SOM) with special attention to human impact through drainage. Our aim was to gain knowledge of SOM quality and soil-forming processes in drained fen soils in northeastern Germany.
   Through techniques of representative landscape analysis, we identified two typical and representative sampling sites in different stages of land use, representing the most important hydrogenetic mire types in northeastern Germany. We adapted chemical fractionation procedures which include hot water extraction (C-hwe and N-hwe) for determination of the labile fraction. Furthermore, a stepwise acid hydrolysis procedure was performed to measure the chemical recalcitrant part of SOM as it is more resistant to biodegradability.
   Total organic C decreased with increasing human impact and intensity of drainage. Conversely, C-hwe and N-hwe concentrations increased with increasing drainage and human impact. In contrast, the more recalcitrant fractions increased with soil depth.
   Generally, there is a lack of existing data about SOM quality and the factors controlling its stability and decomposition in fen soils. For northeastern German fen soils, the data are even more inadequate. Influence of drainage seems to overlap natural influences of site on SOM quality. The used extraction scheme was suitable for the chemical fractionation of SOM into labile and more recalcitrant parts.

AB The genus Drosera (sundews) is represented in British Columbia (BC), Canada, by Drosera rotundifolia (L.), Drosera anglica (Huds.), and their hybrid Drosera x obovata (Mert. & W.D.J. Koch). All three can be found in Sphagnum bogs of central BC, including those within the Aleza Lake Research Forest (ALRF) located 60 km east of Prince George. Vegetation patterns in bogs are known to be correlated with light, water, and nutrient gradients, and despite information being available on the influence of light and water on Drosera occurrence, little information is known about the role of nutrients. Here, we focused on a bog containing all three Drosera species, to determine whether nutrient levels are related to the abundance of the widespread species, D. rotundifolia. Univariate regression tree analysis between soil water chemistry and D. rotundifolia numbers indicates that D. rotundifolia is a calcifuge, preferring moderately acidic soil pH (>5.5) and relatively low calcium levels (<2.88 ppm). This study provides evidence that high soil water calcium and low pH limit the growth of D. rotundifolia in field populations. The physiology underlying this preference, how this is affected by hybridization between other sundew species, and how this mineralogical limitation interacts with other niche-defining factors to dictate the occurrence of D. rotundifolia are questions that remain to be answered.

AB We examined the effects of water level, surface water chemistry, and climatic parameters on aboveground primary plant production, and the tissue nutrient concentrations in the dominant herb species in a bog, three fens, and two marshes. In the fens, total NPP correlated best with NO3- and total phosphorus surface water concentrations in 1993 and 1994. Total NPP in the marshes correlated best with alkalinity in 1993, and with soluble reactive phosphorus in 1994. Climatic parameters, such as mean annual growing season temperature, growing degree days, and precipitation, had the most notable effect on moss growth, whereas shrub and herb production correlated significantly with the water level relative to the moss surface. Herb production correlated positively and shrub production correlated negatively with the water level relative to the moss surface. Tissue nutrient concentrations of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and total phosphorus (TP), and the C:N quotient in Carex lasiocarpa exhibited similar trends in the fens and the marshes. Carbon tissue concentrations in C. lasiocarpa remained unchanged, whereas N and TP tissue levels decreased throughout the growing season. In the site with the highest NPP and presumably the highest stand density, C. lasiocarpa exhibited the highest tissue N and TP levels. Furthermore, TP tissue concentrations in C. lasiocarpa were substantially higher in the marshes than in the fens. Tissue nutrient concentrations in Eriophorum vaginatum in the bog showed variable response patterns. N tissue levels increased, whereas tissue TP concentrations decreased from late June to late August. In the bog, E. vaginatum exhibited similar tissue TP levels to C. lasiocarpa in the fens; however, they were both substantially lower than those found in C. lasiocarpa from the marshes.

AB Each year, a peatland has an annual net carbon balance (NCB), which can be positive (net uptake), zero or negative. Over centuries to millennia, this NCB accumulates as a peat profile. Contemporary peatlands can be sampled (cored), and the past apparent carbon accumulation rate (aCAR) can be determined as the quantity of peat carbon in any particular dated interval down the core profile. We use a process-based peatland carbon and water cycle model to compare peatland annual NCB during millennia of peat accumulation to the contemporary estimate of aCAR, resulting from this accumulation. Integrating over the entire profile, the accumulated NCB must equal the aCAR, but for shorter time intervals, these two quantities can diverge. A climate variation/perturbation that leads to persistent, slow carbon loss or negligible carbon gain through enhanced decomposition will necessarily reduce the aCAR for time periods before the climate variation/perturbation occurred. This can compromise peatland climate-carbon balance relationships inferred from joint analysis of peat cores and paleoclimate reconstructions.

TI Greening of the boreal peatland food web: Periphyton supports secondary
   production in northern peatlands
SO LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
AB Characterizing spatial and temporal variability of food web dynamics is necessary to predict how wetter and more nutrient-rich conditions expected with climate change will influence the fate of organic matter within northern peatlands. The goals of this study were to (1) document spatial and temporal variability in the contribution of periphyton to peatland food webs using isotope analysis (C-13 and N-15), and (2) quantify the influence of increased nutrient availability on primary and secondary production across a gradient of rich, moderate, and poor fen peatlands common to the northern boreal biome. We established replicate m(2) plots within each fen located in interior Alaska to quantify periphyton (algae and bacteria) and macroinvertebrate biomass with and without nutrient addition throughout a growing season (May-August). Stable isotope analysis showed that periphyton contributed x = 65% of organic matter to the food web over time and across fens compared to x = 7% from plants or detritus. The transfer of basal resources was reflected in an increase in herbivore biomass as algal biomass increased over time in all fens, followed by an increase in predatory macroinvertebrates during the latter part of the growing season. Furthermore, all measures of periphyton and macroinvertebrate biomass were enhanced by nutrient addition. These data provide insight into patterns of natural variation within the aquatic food web of boreal peatlands and show that basal resources within this ecosystem, which are generally considered to be "detritus-based," are actually driven by periphyton with minimal input from plant detrital pathways.

AB Sphagnum moss was collected from 22 ombrotrophic (rain-fed) bogs near open pit mines and upgraders within the Athabasca Bituminous Sands (ABS) region of Alberta (AB). Mercury was quantified using two approaches: sector-field ICP-MS of acid digests, and a Direct Mercury Analyser (DMA) for solid samples. Using ICP-MS, the mean Hg concentration in moss from the ABS region (34.7 +/- 1.5 mu g/kg, n = 75) was significantly greater than the control site, Utikuma (26.7 +/- 4.0 mu g/kg, n = 3). Using DMA, the mean Hg concentration in moss from the ABS region (26.2 +/- 0.9 mu g/kg, n = 71) was significantly lower than the control site (28.5 +/- 1.3 mu g/kg, n = 6). These contradictory findings illustrate the challenges associated with comparing the results of two analytical methods, especially given the similarity in Hg concentrations between industrial and background sites, Similar Hg concentrations were also found in Sphagnum moss from two other bogs in AB which are far removed from the ABS region. The Hg concentrations in Sphagnum from the ABS bogs are well below the range found in bog vegetation collected earlier in eastern Canada, and comparable to the lowest values (5th percentile) reported for forest moss collected in 2015 from Norway and Sphagnum moss sampled in 2008 from northern Sweden. Given the rates of Sphagnum accumulation in the ABS region (ca. 215 g/m(2)/yr), Hg accumulation rates there were 5.8-7.5 mu g/m(2)/yr versus 5.7-6.1 mu g/m(2)/yr at the control site (UTK); these are at the upper limit of the range in pre-anthropogenic rates of Hg accumulation for peat from European bogs. Sphagnum moss is abundant in Canada and found in bogs from coast to coast, offering an opportunity to obtain quantitative information on atmospheric Hg deposition to terrestrial ecosystems from natural as well as anthropogenic sources.

AB This study was conducted in the course of a fen rewetting project in NE Germany aiming to restore a heavily drained spring-percolation mire used as pasture land for more than 100 years. Shallow top soil removal (TSR) up to 40 cm was applied to remove the upper degraded peat layer in order to eliminate accumulated nutrients and unwanted seed banks as well as generating material for infilling drain ditchesand building dams. This measure has well known positive effects on species development, but very little was known about the phosphorus (P) status in the newly exposed peat soils and porewater. Therefore, we investigated (i) the P mobilisation potential of surface peat soils, (ii) net P release rates in intact soil cores with different degree of peat decomposition, and (iii) P concentrations in porewater of rewetted fen areas with TSR compared to areas without removal and refilled drain ditches. We highlighted that TSR strongly reduced the P mobilisation potential and thereby also the concentration of dissolved P in the porewater at the peat surface. Furthermore, we found low net P release rates close to 0 mg P m(-2) d(-1)( median, n = 9) in the cut-over areas with less degraded peat similar to those documented for natural fens. Despite of high P concentrations up to 2.6 mg L-1 in rewetted areas without TSR (about 50% of total peatland area) there was no evidence of elevated P export to other low-nutrient areas of the fen or in aclose-by lake due to high P retention capacity of the iron-rich degraded peat (molar Fe: P ratios >10). It can be concluded that TSR is a suitable measure to recover nutrient poor conditions in rewetted fens in a relatively short time frame instead of decades to centuries compared to rewetting measures without TSR. This measure is highly recommended if degraded peatlands are characterised by a low P retention capacity or low molar Fe/P ratios in degraded peat (<10) respectively and above all if downstream areas include nutrient-poor systems highly sensitive regarding slightly increased P inputs.

AB Northern peatlands represent a globally important stock of soil carbon and have acted as a net sink of atmospheric CO2 throughout the Holocene. Disturbance for horticultural peat extraction disrupts ecosystem function and converts these ecosystems to large, persistent sources of carbon dioxide (CO2). This study investigates the effect of ecosystem-scale restoration on growing season CO2 exchange in a peatland by comparing a restored site to a neighboring nonrestored section for 1 year prerestoration (1999) and 3 years postrestoration (2000-2002). Prior to restoration, less than 23% of the site was vegetated, and it was a source of 245 g C m(-2) to the atmosphere during the growing season (May to early October). Following restoration, the water table remained deep, and soil moisture was significantly higher than the nonrestored section. By the third year postrestoration, vegetation covered 50% of the restored peatland. Moss covered 90% of this vegetated area. Vegetation productivity at the restored site was also enhanced with gross ecosystem photosynthesis under full light conditions significantly higher at the restored site at both moss and herbaceous plots by 2002. While this increase in vegetation productivity provided fresh substrate and resulted in higher CO2 production potential for restored site peat, ecosystem respiration was similar to or lower than that at the nonrestored site for both bare peat and vegetated areas because of the generally wetter site conditions resulting from restoration. By upscaling chamber CO2 exchange measurements to the ecosystem level, on the basis of the relative proportion of each surface cover type, we determined the site was a net sink of similar to 20 +/- 5 g C m(-2) during the growing season only 2 years postrestoration. Combining our results with previous work on CH4 emissions and dissolved organic carbon export, we suggest that this degraded peatland ecosystem will likely return to a net carbon sink in 6 to 10 years postrestoration.

AB The fate of carbon stored in permafrost-zone peatlands represents a significant uncertainty in global climate modeling. Given that the breakdown of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is often a major pathway for decomposition in peatlands, knowledge of DOM reactivity under different permafrost regimes is critical for determining future climate feedbacks. To explore the effects of permafrost thaw and resultant plant succession on DOM reactivity, we used a combination of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), UV/Vis absorbance, and excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMS) to examine the DOM elemental composition and optical properties of 27 pore water samples gathered from various sites along a permafrost thaw sequence in Stordalen Mire, a thawing subarctic peatland in northern Sweden. The presence of dense Sphagnum moss, a feature that is dominant in the intermediate thaw stages, appeared to be the main driver of variation in DOM elemental composition and optical properties at Stordalen. Specifically, DOM from sites with Sphagnum had greater aromaticity, higher average molecular weights, and greater O/C, consistent with a higher abundance of phenolic compounds that likely inhibit decomposition. These compounds are released by Sphagnum and may accumulate due to inhibition of phenol oxidase activity by the acidic pH at these sites. In contrast, sites without Sphagnum, specifically fully-thawed rich fens, had more saturated, more reduced compounds, which were high in N and S. Optical properties at rich fens indicated the presence of microbially-derived DOM, consistent with the higher decomposition rates previously measured at these sites. These results indicate that Sphagnum acts as an inhibitor of rapid decomposition and CH4 release in thawing subarctic peatlands, consistent with lower rates of CO2 and CH4 production previously observed at these sites. However, this inhibitory effect may disappear if Sphagnum-dominated bogs transition to more waterlogged rich fens that contain very little to no living Sphagnum. Release of this inhibition allows for higher levels of microbial activity and potentially greater CH4 release, as has been observed in these fen sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Climate warming is predicted to increase heterotrophic metabolism in northern peatland soils leading to enhanced greenhouse gas emissions. However, the specific relationships between temperature and the greenhouse gas producing microbial communities are poorly understood. Thus, in this study, the temperature dependence of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) production rates along with abundance and composition of microbial communities were investigated in peat from a Sphagnum-dominated peatland, S1 bog (Minnesota, United States). Whereas CH4 production rates increased with temperature up to 30 degrees C, CO2 production did not, resulting in a lower CO2:CH4 ratio with increasing temperature. CO2 production showed both psychrophilic and mesophilic maxima at 4 and 20 degrees C, respectively, and appears to be mediated by two anaerobic microbial communities, one that operates under psychrophilic conditions that predominate for much of the year, and another that is more active under warmer conditions during the growing season. In incubations at 10 degrees C above the ambient range, members of the Clostridiaceae and hydrogenotrophic methanogens of the Methanobacteriaceae dominated. Moreover, a significant negative correlation between temperature and microbial diversity was observed. Results indicate that the potential consequences of warming surface peat in northern peatlands include a large stimulation in CH4 production and a significant loss of microbial diversity.

AB The depth of the groundwater table below the surface and its spatiotemporal variability are major controls on all major biogeophysical processes in northern peatlands, including ecohydrology, carbon balance, and greenhouse gas exchange. In these ecosystems, water table fluctuations are buffered by compression and expansion of peat. Controls on peat volume change and its spatial variability, however, remain elusive, hampering accurate assessment of climate change impact on functioning of peatlands. We therefore (1) analysed patterning of seasonal surface elevation change at high spatial resolution (0.5 m); (2) assessed its relationship with vegetation, geohydrology, and position within the peatland; and (3) quantified the consequences for peatland surface topography and ecohydrology. Changes in surface elevation were monitored using digital close-range photogrammetry along a transect in a northern peatland from after snowmelt up to midgrowing season (May-July). Surface elevation change was substantial and varied spatially from -0.062 to +0.012 m over the measurement period. Spatial patterns of peat volume change were correlated up to 40.8 m. Spatial variation of peat volume change was mainly controlled by changes in water table, and to a lesser extent to vegetation, with peat volume change magnitude increasing from lawn < hollow < flark. Our observations suggest that patchiness and vertical variability of peatland surface topography are a function of the groundwater table. In dry conditions, the variability of surface elevation increases and more localized groundwater flows may develop. Consequently, spatially variable peat volume change may enhance peatland water retention and thereby sustain carbon uptake during drought.

AB Mud-bottom hollows are depressions on the bog surface where Sphagnum mosses have died and peat accumulation is retarded or even replaced with loss by oxidation. Results of measurements carried out at Mannikjarve Bog, central Estonia, confirmed that peat accumulation has stopped and that in 1999-2001 the uppermost 2-3 cm thick surface layer of mud-bottom hollows became thinner by 1.95 +/- 0.75 mm yr(-1) (n = 188). Different methods revealed the corresponding carbon loss from the mud-bottom hollows 25 mm thick surface layer as 50-60 g C m(-2) yr(-1). As a result, the surface of mud-bottom hollows becomes lower as compared to surroundings with peat accumulation c. 1.5 mm yr(-1), and they are likely to have an important role in the differentiation of bog microtopography. Owing to the combination of a cessation in peat accumulation, carbon loss by oxidation and increased emission of decomposition gases, mud-bottom hollows could have an important influence on the carbon budget of bogs.

AB Peatlands represent important archives of Holocene paleoclimatic information. However, autogenic processes may disconnect peatland hydrological behavior from climate and overwrite climatic signals in peat records. We use a simulation model of peatland development driven by a range of Holocene climate reconstructions to investigate climate signal preservation in peat records. Simulated water-table depths and peat decomposition profiles exhibit homeostatic recovery from prescribed changes in rainfall, whereas changes in temperature cause lasting alterations to peatland structure and function. Autogenic ecohydrological feedbacks provide both high- and low-pass filters for climatic information, particularly rainfall. Large-magnitude climatic changes of an intermediate temporal scale (i.e., multidecadal to centennial) are most readily preserved in our simulated peat records. Simulated decomposition signals are offset from the climatic changes that generate them due to a phenomenon known as secondary decomposition. Our study provides the mechanistic foundations for a framework to separate climatic and autogenic signals in peat records.

AB The results of a long-term (1999-2007) investigation of vegetation productivity and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from the surface of an oligotrophic mire in southern taiga in Western Siberia are presented. The studied ecosystems include pine shrub-sphagnum (PSS) community, a similar community with oppressed ( low) tree stand (LPSS), and sedge-sphagnum fen (SSF). Net primary production for PSS, LPSS and SSF are equal to 552, 575, and 561 g m(-2) yr(-1). The mean respiration during the snow-free season determined by chamber method is 165.8, 105.6, 112.4 mgCO(2) m(-2) h(-1) for PSS, LPSS and SSF, respectively. Field measurements of NPP and CO2 emission in combination with reference data on methane emission, winter CO2 and CH4 emissions and carbon export by river run-off were used to develop an overall carbon budget of the mire ecosystems. At present conditions the studied mire ecosystems are net sinks for atmospheric carbon and accumulate peat. Rates of the actual modern carbon accumulation are equal to 21, 112 and 102 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for PSS, LPSS and SSF communities.

AB In the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, fluxes of water, energy, and carbon determine the water and carbon balance of peat bogs. We used eddy covariance (EC) measurements to study surface atmosphere exchange and its drivers above an ombrotrophic peat bog (Odersprungmoor) in the Harz Mountains, Germany, with nonideal measurement conditions during the growing season in 2013. For montane peatlands, only very few EC flux measurements exist due to site constraints, for example, surface slope, limited fetch, and frequent dew formation on open path sensors. The measured data were carefully filtered resulting in valid and representative fluxes for the bog. The evapotranspiration (ET) was further characterized by determining the adjusted crop coefficient (K-c*) for July and August and comparing it with K-c* values from 7 years of the FLUXNET site Mer Bleue bog, Ontario, Canada. While soil moisture was taken into consideration, the adjustment was nevertheless necessary as plant health and nutrient supply were not evaluated as required by FAO guidelines. Actual ET at OM was well described by the K-c* model (K-c* = 0.85, R-2 = 0.85). The primary control on ET was available energy and atmospheric conditions and, marginally, the soil moisture conditions. This K-c* value is comparable to the calculated K-c* values for MB, which ranged between 0.82 and 0.86 (R-2 between 0.84 and 0.97). Since these K-c* ranges are narrow for the different sites and years, we hypothesize that these values are good estimates for the true crop coefficients of Sphagnum-dominated peat bogs.

AB Irish peat soils are extensive, covering approximately 14-20% of the national land area. They contain between 53% and 62% of the national soil organic carbon stock. Montane blanket bog covers approximately 25% or 242650ha of the total peatland area in Ireland and is the dominant peatland type covering the upland area of Wicklow. Blanket bogs are very sensitive systems and have experienced much disturbance in Ireland due to overgrazing, burning, drainage, forestry and turf cutting. It has been estimated that disturbance of blanket bog, on a national area basis, ranges from 74% to 82% and in Wicklow is 57%. Disturbance can be detrimental to stocks of soil organic carbon in peatlands. Monitoring disturbance in peatlands, which tend to cover large, remote areas, is difficult and expensive using conventional surveying methods. Satellite remote sensing offers a way to gather data for these areas. In this paper a method of determining the probability of disturbance is presented. This method uses the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) in combination with univariate image differencing along with thresholding and binary logistic regression. A probability map was produced depicting the geospatial patterns and pressures on the peatland soil organic carbon stock in Wicklow. Peat soils in higher and steeper areas were more disturbed and the primary disturbance in between 2000 and 2005 was fire. Lower, flatter areas did not experience as much disturbance probably because they are wetter. The consumer's and producer's accuracy for the map was 76% and 42%, respectively.

AB In boreal peatlands, the aboveground (plant) and belowground (microbial) communities are acutely linked because the whole soil profile is partially decomposed plant matter (peat), and dictates the nutrients available to the belowground system. We characterized the aboveground and belowground communities in two boreal peatlands: a Sphagnum-dominated fen and a Carex-dominated fen. We link the plant and microbial communities by observing plant, litter and peat carbon and nitrogen values. The Sphagnum-dominated fen had greater plant diversity but provided low quality litter inputs (high carbon:nitrogen) that formed peat and that corresponded with greater fungi:bacteria and Gram-positive:Gram-negative bacteria microbial community compared to the Carex-dominated fen. The higher quality plant inputs in the Carex-dominated fen supported a 5 x greater microbial biomass that was also 2 x more active (as measure by CO2 production). In this approach we highlight that peatlands and their component plant and microbial communities play-out along a common resource-spectrum that dictates 'fast' vs 'slow' carbon and nutrient cycling (i.e., a plant-soil interaction spectrum) that can, in turn, affect carbon storage potential. As peatland plant community composition is predicted to shift and decomposition rates are expected to increase under climate change, our work highlights the importance of understanding plant-soil microbial interactions.

AB Increasing use of wood fuels for energy production in Finland since the 1990s implies that large quantities of the generated ashes will be available for forest fertilization. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of wood ash application on Cs-137 activity concentrations in Scots pine (Anus sylvestris L) needles and certain berries and mushrooms on drained peatlands. The study was based on field experiments carried out on two mires in Finland in 1997-1998. Two different types of wood ash were applied at dosages of 3500, 3700, 10 500 and 11 100 kg ha(-1). Wood ash did not increase Cs-137 activity concentration in plants in the second growing season following application. On the contrary, a decrease in Cs-137 activity concentration was seen in the plants of the ecosystem on drained peatlands. This result is of importance, for instance, when recycling of ash is being planned. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is an increasing interest in considering ecosystem processes after fen restoration, and not solely species composition. To evaluate the success of ecological restoration, comparisons with targets from reference ecosystems are required. We documented net primary production (NPP) and decomposition of the main vegetation components in order to describe a reference data set for ecological restoration of moderately rich to rich minerotrophic peatlands (fens) in southeastern Canada. Data collection included three growing seasons for herbs and shrubs and two growing seasons for belowground biomass, trees and bryophytes. Average NPP for above and belowground biomass of three selected natural basin fens were 450 g m(-2) yr(-1). Belowground NPP represented 45% of the total NPP. Sphagnum warnstorfii was the most productive bryophyte (140 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and the slowest plant species to decompose (exponential decomposition constant k = 0.07 yr(-1)). The brown mosses Tomenthypnum nitens, Campylium stellatum and Scorpidium cossonii had a NPP of 79, 69 and 92 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, and decomposed at the same rate (identical k values of 0.14 yr(-1)). Trees covered a large surface area in the fens, with an average NPP of 73 g m(-2) yr(-1). S. warnstorfii contributed to hummocks having a higher peat accumulation potential than lawn vegetation. The graminoid Trichophorum cespitosum significantly increased NPP in lawns and should be targeted in restoration plans for fens. To restore peat accumulating processes (production and decomposition) in fens, bryophytes should be the primary focus for re-introduction, specifically species that are adapted to living in drier conditions, such as hummock species. The range of variability for NPP and decomposition established by this study should be considered as a decision tool in restoration projects to monitor restored ecosystems trajectories and successes.

AB Wetlands are found extensively throughout the Western Boreal Plain, a region under pressure because of disturbance by the oil and gas industries. To understand how wetland systems may respond to disturbance and set targets for reclamation efforts, it is necessary to understand natural variability in nutrient dynamics in the landscape. The purpose of this study was to characterize spatial variability in peatland nutrient (nitrogen, N, and phosphorus, P) dynamics in the Athabasca Oil Sands (AOS) region. N and P availability and net mineralization rates in the upper 10cm layer of peat were examined during the peak growing season in five peatlands that fell along an apparent moisture gradient. N and P dynamics within and among the sites were related to water table position, peat moisture content and temperature. Phosphorus supply rates and total inorganic N pools and supply rates were generally elevated under wetter conditions, whereas nitrate (NO3-) pools and supply rates and P pools did not vary along a moisture gradient. In general, net immobilization was observed at the wetter sites where nutrient pools were elevated and net mineralization was observed at drier sites where nutrient pools were lower. Nutrient transformation rates were most strongly driven by warmer temperatures. Nutrient availability and immobilization rates were anomalously high at one peatland (a disturbed fen with a semi-permanent road and decommissioned well pads). We suggest that reclamation and management practices should focus on regulating peatland hydrologic conditions, optimizing these for the most desirable nutrient levels for vegetation growth.

AB Long-term climate reconstructions are frequently based on tree-ring high-resolution proxies extracted from subfossil peatland trees. Peatlands are peculiar ecosystems characterized by high moisture in the upper soil part which creates a harsh living environment for trees. The climate mostly indirectly influences tree growth determining seasonal variations in the water table level. Within this framework, the aim of this study was to investigate climate responses of trees (Pinus sylvestris L.) growing inside and outside a Southern Alpine peat bog, by using tree-ring and wood anatomical traits (e.g. tracheid number and dimension, cell-wall thickness). Our results showed differences in the xylem structure and climate signal recorded by peatland and mineral soil trees. Peatland trees were characterized by narrow rings and tracheids with thinner cell wall. Summer temperature and precipitation were the major drivers of xylem formation in peatland trees. At intra-annual level wood anatomical traits revealed a complex within-ring signal during the growing season. The multi-parameters approach together with the high-resolution gained by using tree-ring sectors allowed us to obtain new detailed information on the xylem development of peatland trees and climate drivers that influenced it.

AB High-latitude peatlands contain about one third of the world's soil organic carbon, most of which is derived from partly decomposed Sphagnum (peat moss) plants. We conducted a meta-analysis based on a global data set of Sphagnum growth measurements collected from published literature to investigate the effects of bioclimatic variables on Sphagnum growth. Analysis of variance and general linear models were used to relate Sphagnum magellanicum and S. fuscum growth rates to photosynthetically active radiation integrated over the growing season (PAR0) and a moisture index. We found that PAR0 was the main predictor of Sphagnum growth for the global data set, and effective moisture was only correlated with moss growth at continental sites. The strong correlation between Sphagnum growth and PAR0 suggests the existence of a global pattern of growth, with slow rates under cool climate and short growing seasons, highlighting the important role of growing season length in explaining peatland biomass production. Large-scale patterns of cloudiness during the growing season might also limit moss growth. Although considerable uncertainty remains over the carbon balance of peatlands under a changing climate, our results suggest that increasing PAR0 as a result of global warming and lengthening growing seasons, without major change in cloudiness, could promote Sphagnum growth. Assuming that production and decomposition have the same sensitivity to temperature, this enhanced growth could lead to greater peat-carbon sequestration, inducing a negative feedback to climate change.

AB The quantitative and qualitative compositions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined, and the vertical stratification of PAHs was characterized along profiles in hummocky tundra peatlands. In perennially frozen peat layers, PAHs occur in a conserved state and do not undergo transformation in contrast to seasonally thawed layers. Statistically significant correlations were detected between the mass fraction of 5-6-ring structures (especially, benzo[ghi]perylene), individual PAHs, and botanical composition of the peat at the thawing-freezing boundary; and profile relations for various combinations of PAHs were calculated. The radiocarbon and paleobotanical analysis of peatlands in combination with the obtained results can be used for assignment of initial vegetation to periods of peat formation in the Holocene and as markers of the response of the peatland permafrost to climate changes at high latitudes.

AB Understanding soil organic matter concentration (SOM) and chemistry in different peatlands can help design appropriate management practices for sustainable use of peatland agroecosystems. However, detailed information on characteristics of SOM concentration and chemistry is not available for most peatland agroecosystems in general and in northern Germany in particular. In this study, we investigated the SOM concentration and chemistry of drained and rewetted percolation mires, forest and coastal peatlands. We used simple chemical analysis, pyrolysis field ionization mass spectroscopy (Py-FIMS), and carbon and nitrogen X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The total organic carbon (C-org), total nitrogen (N), and total sulfur (S) contents were significantly (P < 0.05) different among the peatlands. The C-org at the surface horizons ranged from 164 to 373 g kg(-1), and these values were lower than that of the subsurface horizons of the studied peat lands except for the drained alder carr forest and coastal peatlands. The Py-FIMS indicated that the labile SOM compound classes (carbohydrates, phenols, and lignin monomers, and amino acids, peptides, and amino-sugars) and stable SOM compounds classes (lignin dimers, heterocyclic nitrogen compounds, and nitriles) were abundant at the surface horizons. However, the stable compound classes such as lipids, alkanes, alkenes, fatty acids, n-alkyl esters, and suberin were more abundant at the subsurface horizons than the surface horizons. The carbon K-edge spectra revealed that aromatic C, carboxylic C, O-alkyl, and aliphatic C were the predominant C functional groups, whereas N K edge spectra indicated that the amide group was the predominated N functional group. The SOM concentrations and some compound classes were higher in the rewetted sites of alder carr forest peatland (more carbohydrates, suberin and fatty acids) and of percolation mires (more lignin dimers, lipids and alkylaromatics). The results indicate that the effects of rewetting peatlands on SOM concentration and chemistry depend on peatland type.

AB Little information exists concerning the long-term interactive effect of nitrogen (N) addition with phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) on Sphagnum N status. This study was conducted as part of a long-term N manipulation on Whim bog in south Scotland to evaluate the long-term alleviation effects of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) on N saturation of Sphagnum (S. capillifolium). On this ombrotrophic peatland, where ambient deposition was 8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), 56 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) of either ammonium (NW, N-red) or nitrate (NO3-, N-OX) with and without P and K, were added over 11 years. Nutrient concentrations of Sphagnum stem and capitulum, and pore water quality of the Sphagnum layer were assessed. The N-saturated Sphagnum caused by long-term (11 years) and high doses (56 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) of reduced N was not completely ameliorated by P and K addition; N concentrations in Sphagnum capitula for N-red 56 PK were comparable with those for N-red 56, although N concentrations in Sphagnum stems for N-red 56 PK were lower than those for Nred 56. While dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations in pore water for N-red 56 PK were not different from N-red 56, they were lower for N-OX 56 PK than for N-OX 56 whose stage of N saturation had not advanced compared to N-red 56. These results indicate that increasing P and K availability has only a limited amelioration effect on the N assimilation of Sphagnum at an advanced stage of N saturation. This study concluded that over the long-term P and K additions will not offset the N saturation of Sphagnum. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mountain fens found in western North America have sequestered atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) for millennia, provide important habitat for wildlife, and serve as refugia for regionally-rare plant species typically found in boreal regions. It is unclear how Rocky Mountain fens are responding to a changing climate. It is possible that fens found at lower elevations may be particularly susceptible to changes because hydrological cycles that control water tables are likely to vary the most. In this study, we fit models of growing season ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange to field-measured data among eight fen plant communities at four mountain fens along a climatic gradient in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and Wyoming. Differences in growing season net ecosystem production (NEP) among study sites were not well correlated with monsoon precipitation, despite a twofold increase in summer rainfall between two study regions. Our results show that NEP was higher for fens located at high elevations compared to those found at lower elevations, with growing season estimates ranging from -342 to 256 g CO2-C m(-2). This was reflected in the negative correlation of growing season NEP with air temperature, and positive correlation with water table position, as the high elevation sites had the lowest air temperatures and highest water tables due to greater snowpack and later onset of melt. Our results suggest that sustainability of mountain fens occurring at the lower end of the known elevation range may be particularly susceptible to a changing climate, as these peatlands already experience lower snowpack, earlier snow melt, and warmer growing season air temperatures, which are all likely to be exacerbated under a future climate.

AB This paper reviews current research in Canada relating to the sedimentology of coal-bearing sequences and the petrographic character of contained seams from selected intermontane and foreland basin settings.
   The intermontane Cumberland and Stellarton basins of Nova Scotia contain Westphalian coal-bearing strata of different character. Coal seams that formed in fluvial-dominated depositional environments of the Springhill Coalfield, Cumberland Basin, commonly brighten upward and laterally display distinct areal zones: a piedmont zone formed by interfingering of mire and distal fan sheet-flow deposits; an inner mire zone largely devoid of partings and a riverine zone with large-scale seam splits about multistorey sandstone bodies. Maceral-based groundwater influence and vegetation indices, combined with miospore analyses, indicate that the peat precursors of the No. 3 seam of the inner mire zone accumulated from a groundwater-influenced (rheotrophic to mesotrophic) forest mire (swamp, fen). Both the gelification of lignin-derived maceral precursors and the domination of mire vegetation by lycopsid trees reflect this groundwater influence.
   Coal that formed from the frequently flooded paleomires of the Stellarton Basin is generally dull, microbanded and mineral-rich. The location of mires within the basin was largely determined by basin subsidence rates. When subsidence rates were high, mires developed around the margin of a central basin lake. Coal seams that formed from these mires (e.g. McLeod seam) thicken toward basin margins and grade into sapropelic shale near the basin centre. Petrographic analyses of the McLeod seam suggest development from limnic to wet forest swamp conditions and a return to a limnic environment at the top of the seam. Thick coal (e.g. Foord seam) developed near the basin centre during periods of lower subsidence rates and grades into red beds and paleosols toward the basin margin. The Foord seam of the basin centre is characterized by low mineral matter contents and a high proportion of degraded vitrinite macerals in the central parts of the seam, interpreted to reflect prolonged peat accumulation with very limited clastic input. The top and the base of the seam, in contrast, were subjected to significant clastic input, as indicated by microbanding associated with significant amounts of detrital minerals and macerals.
   Coal seams of the Lower Cretaceous Gates Formation in the Western Canada Basin formed in depositional settings ranging from coastal swamps (strandplains) to the upper delta plain. Strand-plain coal is characterized by great lateral continuity and substantial thickness, whereas coal of the upper delta plain is thin and discontinuous. The strandplain coal is characterized by variable lithotype sequences (oscillatory, brightening-up, dulling-up). Maceral-based facies parameters indicate a wide range of mire facies for these lithotype successions: open moor, forest moor, herbaceous and/or shrubby marshes and slightly raised mires. Results from megafossil and phyteral analyses suggest that the coastal plain mires were dominated by taxodiaceous conifers, whereas ferns, angiosperms and herbaceous lycopods are thought to have occupied the more marshy and/or marginal (stream/lake side) environments.

AB Physical and chemical, and pore-scale to field-scale properties of peat soil affect the migration of non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) and dissolved-phase solutes in contaminated peatlands in a way not anticipated based on the current understanding derived from their behavior in mineral soil systems. Peat pore surface wettability, which is determined by pore surface chemistry, has strong hysteresis and shows hydrophilic and hydrophobic behaviors during water drainage from and water imbibition into pore spaces. This leads to high residual NAPL saturation in pore spaces. Systematic reduction of pore radius size with depth associated with greater peat decomposition in a typical peat profile leads to an increase in NAPL-entry capillary pressure and a reduction in peat permeability with increasing depth. The former leads to stronger capillarity in deeper peat horizons, causing resistance to NAPL percolation compared to that in shallow ones; along with decreased permeability with depth, this results in higher NAPL mobility in shallower peat. The cumulative effect is preferential horizontal migration of NAPL in shallow less decomposed peat horizons. Occupation of peat macro-pores by NAPL dramatically decreases the effective water permeability and leads to lower rates of water infiltration and groundwater discharge in the contaminated area. With respect to dissolved-phase hydrocarbons, the dual porosity structure of peat soil, which exhibits larger pores and higher effective porosity near the surface, also favours preferential transport in the surface peat layer, and leads to increasing solute retardation with depth. In addition, adsorption of hydrocarbon solutes onto natural dissolved organic carbon present in peat pore water influences the effective adsorption of hydrocarbon solutes onto peat by reducing the apparent adsorption partitioning coefficient. The concepts and evidence presented in this manuscript suggest both free-phase and dissolved-phase hydrocarbon have restricted mobility in peatlands. On this basis, in large peatlands where ecological function is not notably impacted, a case can be made for allowing natural processes to degrade the hydrocarbon, rather than the common response of digging up and disposing of contaminated soils, which destroys the ecosystem function.

AB Mechanical harvesting of peatlands completely changes the original bog ecosystem and without afteruse causes long-lasting disturbance in the environment due to the limited restoration capacity of the habitat. We studied the effects of fertilization on the establishment of vegetation on a cut-away peatland in Finland. Six treatments of different quantities and mixtures of wood ash, peat ash, biotite, or forest P-K fertilizer were replicated in three plots. Although all the fertilizers accelerated the revegetation of a cut-away peatland significantly, ash-based fertilizers had the greatest and most immediate impact on the formation of vegetation. Ash fertilizers especially increased the coverage of small fire-loving moss species such as Ceratodon purpureus (Hedw.) Brid., Funaria hygrometrica Hedw., and Leptobryum pyriforme (Hedw.) Wils. in the early stages of the succession. Furthermore, the succeeding coverage of vascular plants improves nutritional conditions through the rapid accumulation and decomposition of plant-derived litter. The rapid formation of ground vegetation on bare peat surface after ash fertilizer application indicated that wood and peat ash are suitable for mined peatlands. This being the case, peat and wood ash should be regarded more as a recyclable constituent rather than as waste in afforestation of cut-away peatlands.

AB Questions Fens are important conservation targets in temperate Europe. When hydrologically undisturbed, fens remain open for millennia. However, unaltered fens are scarce, and today their biodiversity largely depends on conservational mowing applied to prevent successional shifts. However, the effects on community structure and conservation values are uncertain, and management might not always be needed where it is a priori applied by managers. Thus, within the presented study, we ask the following questions: (a) How is the species and functional composition of fens influenced by mowing? (b) Does mowing increase the conservation value of fen ecosystems? Location Lowland fens, northern Poland. Methods The sample consisted of 27 pairs of mown and unmown plots, located within ten sites. Ordination methods were used to assess the influence of mowing on species composition. Functional traits related to competitiveness, flowering time, mycorrhizal associations and functional groups were used to characterize plant communities and species richness, and the number of specialist and red-listed species was used to evaluate conservation values. Differences between mown and unmown plots were assessed using linear mixed-effect models and the effect size approach. Results Management of fens suppresses the growth of trees, shrubs and highly competitive herbaceous species and inhibits the encroachment of Sphagnum mosses. At the same time, it enhances the establishment of species from other ecosystems (grasses, ruderal species, species of drier sites) within fens and alters the microtopography of the fen surface. Conclusions Mowing can enhance species richness and the presence of rich fen specialists in transformed sites, but it can lead to fen ecosystem deterioration towards managed meadow communities within sites sustaining many typical fen species and functional characteristics.

AB The expanding antibiotic resistance crisis calls for a more in depth understanding of the importance of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in pristine environments. We, therefore, studied the microbiome associated with Sphagnum moss forming the main vegetation in undomesticated, evolutionary old bog ecosystems. In our complementary analysis of culture collections, metagenomic data and a fosmid library from different geographic sites in Europe, we identified a low abundant but highly diverse pool of resistance determinants, which targets an unexpectedly broad range of 29 antibiotics including natural and synthetic compounds. This derives both, from the extraordinarily high abundance of efflux pumps (up to 96%), and the unexpectedly versatile set of ARGs underlying all major resistance mechanisms. Multi-resistance was frequently observed among bacterial isolates, e.g. in Serratia, Rouxiella, Pandoraea, Paraburkholderia and Pseudomonas. In a search for novel ARGs, we identified the new class A beta-lactamase Mm3. The native Sphagnum resistome comprising a highly diversified and partially novel set of ARGs contributes to the bog ecosystem ' s plasticity. Our results reinforce the ecological link between natural and clinically relevant resistomes and thereby shed light onto this link from the aspect of pristine plants. Moreover, they underline that diverse resistomes are an intrinsic characteristic of plant-associated microbial communities, they naturally harbour many resistances including genes with potential clinical relevance.

AB Carbon dioxide and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured in a cutover bog of the Jura Mountains (France) together with biotic and abiotic variables for two entire vegetation periods in order to compare the carbon balance of the bog at three stages of regeneration.
   Among all factors, air temperature and vegetation index (including leaf area of vascular plants, bryophyte density and bryophyte desiccation) were the two main determinants of ecosystem respiration and gross photosynthesis at light saturation.
   During 2004 and 2005, the vegetated plots acted as carbon sinks. Net carbon exchange ranged between 67 and 166 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the Eriophorum-dominated plots and between 93 and 183 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the Sphagnum-dominated plots. The bare peat plots represented a net carbon source (between -19 and -32 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Methane fluxes accounted for a very small part of the total carbon efflux (< 2%).
   The recovery of vegetation in our naturally regenerating bog was beneficial for the carbon sequestration after the relatively short period of 20 yr.

TI PERMAFROST DISTRIBUTION IN PEATLANDS OF WEST-CENTRAL CANADA DURING THE
   HOLOCENE WARM PERIOD 6000 YEARS BP
SO GEOGRAPHIE PHYSIQUE ET QUATERNAIRE
LA English
DT Article
AB The extent and distribution of permafrost in peatlands 6000 years ago was investigated in the present discontinuous and continuous permafrost zones of west-central Canada. Permafrost peatlands were cored at 161 locations and the floristic composition of the peat was determined from macrofossil analysis. The reconstructed paleoenvironments were used to indicate the presence or absence of permafrost at the time of peat formation. Chronological control was provided by radiocarbon dating of substantial changes in the peat sequences and by dates of basal peat deposits. Peatland formation began after glacial ice disappeared from the land surface of west-central Canada. Macrofossils indicate that most peatlands were fens without permafrost at 6 ka, except in the far north. Permafrost was already present in many areas of the Arctic, and peat accumulation occurred under permafrost conditions. In the southern area, permafrost development in peatlands began about 4 ka as the middle Holocene warm period came to a close. Permafrost development in the fens was associated with the development of a Sphagnum-dominated surface on the fens, caused by the onset of a cooler and moister climate. The insulation provided by the surface peat layer and by the associated tree cover initiated permafrost development in small lenses that coalesced into large permafrost bodies according to the prevailing climatic conditions. At the target date, 6 ka, permafrost was present in some peatlands, but the distribution zones shifted 300 to 500 km to the north, relative to the present zonation. It is estimated that this corresponds to a mean annual temperature that was about 5 degrees C warmer than at present.

AB The Paleogene succession of the Helmstedt Lignite Mining District in Northern Germany includes coastal peat mire records from the latest Paleocene to the middle Eocene at the southern edge of the Proto-North Sea. Therefore, it covers the different long- and short-term climate perturbations of the Paleogene greenhouse. 56 samples from three individual sections of a lower Eocene seam in the record capture the typical succession of the vegetation in a coastal wetland during a period that was not affected by climate perturbation. This allows facies-dependent vegetational changes to be distinguished from those that were climate induced. Cluster analyses and NMDS of well-preserved palynomorph assemblages reveal four successional stages in the vegetation during peat accumulation: (1) a coastal vegetation, (2) an initial mire, (3) a transitional mire, and (4) a terminal mire. Biodiversity measures show that plant diversity decreased significantly in the successive stages. The highly diverse vegetation at the coast and in the adjacent initial mire was replaced by low diversity communities adapted to wet acidic environments and nutrient deficiency. The palynomorph assemblages are dominated by elements such as Alnus (Betulaceae) or Sphagnum (Sphagnaceae). Typical tropical elements which are characteristic for the middle Eocene part of the succession are missing. This indicates that a more warm-temperate climate prevailed in northwestern Germany during the early lower Eocene.

AB Drained peatlands are hotspots of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from agricultural soils. As a consequence of both drainage-induced mineralisation and anthropogenic mixing with mineral soils, large areas of former peatlands under agricultural use underwent a secondary transformation of the peat (e.g. formation of aggregates). These soils show contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) at the boundary between mineral and organic soils. However, the carbon (C) dynamics of such soils have rarely been studied so far. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the vulnerability of soil organic matter (SOM) to decomposition over the whole range of peat-derived soils under agriculture including very carbon rich mineral soils (76-526 g kg(-1) SOC). A total of 62 soil samples covering a broad range of soil and site characteristics were selected from the sample set of the German Agricultural Soil Inventory. Potential CO2 production was measured by aerobic incubation. Fen and bog peat samples were grouped into disturbance classes according to their soil properties. Specific basal respiration rates (SBR), i.e. CO2 fluxes per unit SOC, showed the highest values for the most disturbed samples for both fen peat (13.9 +/- 6.0 mu g CO2-C g SOC-1 h(-1)) and bog peat (10.9 +/- 4.7 mu g CO2-C g SOC-1 h(-1)). Respiration rates of bog peat increased more strongly with an increasing degree of disturbance than those of fen peat. Perhaps counterintuitively, SOM vulnerability to decomposition thus increased with an increasing degree of disturbance and a decreasing SOC content, indicating positive feedback mechanisms as soon as peat soils are disturbed by drainage. Furthermore, the variability of the SBR increased drastically with increasing degree of disturbance. The turnover of SOM in less disturbed peat samples tended to be higher in samples with higher nitrogen (N) content, higher pH value and lower C:N ratio, while plant-available phosphorus was important for the mineralisation of more severely disturbed peat. However, clear correlations between a single soil property and SBR could not be identified. The high potential of CO2 emissions from organic soils with a low SOC content implies that mixing organic soil with mineral soil does not seem to be a promising option for mitigating greenhouse emissions.

AB Northern peatlands are a vital component of the global carbon cycle, containing large stores of soil organic carbon and acting as a long-term carbon sink. Moss productivity is an important factor in determining whether these wetlands will retain this function under future climatic conditions. Research on unsaturated water flow in peatlands, which controls moss productivity during periods of evaporative stress, has focused on relatively deep bog systems. However, shallower peatlands and marginal connective wetlands can be essential components of many landscape mosaics. In order to better understand factors influencing moss productivity, water balance simulations using HYDRUS-1D were run for different soil profile depths, compositions, and antecedent moisture conditions. Our results demonstrate a bimodal distribution of peatland realizations, either primarily conserving water by limiting evapotranspiration or maximizing moss productivity. For sustained periods of evaporative stress, both deep water storage and a shallow initial water table delay the onset of high vegetative stress, thus maximizing moss productivity. A total depth of sand and peat of 0.8m is identified as the threshold above which increasing peat depth has no effect on changing vegetative stress response. In contrast, wetlands with shallow peat deposits (less than 0.5m thick) are least able to buffer prolonged periods of evaporation due to limited labile water storage and will thus quickly experience vegetative stress and so limit evaporation and conserve water. With a predicted increase in the frequency and size of rain events in continental North America, the moss productivity of shallow wetland systems may increase, but also greater moisture availability will increase the likelihood they remain as wetlands in a changing climate.

AB The paper consists of a dynamical approach to mire-related vegetation and land use development.  Investigations were carried out on two different study levels.  First, successions of mire plant communities (community or C-level), based on stratigraphical core sample data, and, second, dynamics of plant cover and land use (PC&LU) types of mire landscapes (landscape or L-level), based on sequential aerial photographs (AP), were studied.
   The first reveals mainly autogenic successions of plant communities over several thousand years, the second, natural and anthropogenic successions of PC&LU types over a 30 year time span.
   The source data for the quantitative analysis on the basis of Markov model (MM) were provided by 17 peat types as the representatives of corresponding plant communities, taken from cores through the genetic centres of mires (C-level).  Nineteen PC&LU types as the representatives of hybrid systems, were deduced from AP of three time periods (L-level).
   The first order MM, mainly used in ecological modelling, was also applied in addition to the C-level treatment, to a more complicated investigation, i.e. L-level.
   As an extension of the first order MM, second order effects were modelled.  For ease of analysis of three-dimensional matrices, three states of succession (after reduction 17- and 19-element classification schemes to 3 element) only were used.
   The treatment represented has been used to reconstruct historical development of mire plant communities and PC&LU types in mire landscapes and analyse the future development of the corresponding types.  The analysis of the first and second order models and predictions made on this basis are given.

AB The effects of temperature, water table, and precipitation on the methane fluxes from a boreal low-sedge Sphagnum papillosum pine fen were analyzed with statistical cross correlations of daily data. The six measurement sites represented different vegetation surfaces of the mire (hummocks, lawns, and flarks) with increasing moisture. The dynamics were analyzed separately for the early summer (May-July) and the late summer (August-October) periods in addition to the whole summer (May-October) period. Methane emissions increased with increasing peat temperature. During the late summer period, changes in peat temperatures at depths of 20 and 50 cm were reflected in methane emissions within 2 days. The persistently high water tables during the measurement period probably did not reveal the dynamics between water table fluctuations and methane emissions very clearly. Methane emission levels correlated negatively with depths of the water tables, that is, high methane emissions were associated with low water tables and vice versa. The suppression of methane emissions by filling the unsaturated gas space during precipitation and the increased release rate caused by a declining water table could explain the result. Methane emissions correlated positively with changes in water tables, that is, a rise in water table increased methane emissions during the early and whole summer periods. Precipitation increased emissions with a lag from zero to several days throughout the summer. Generally, the estimated responses of methane fluxes to precipitation and changes in water table indicated similar time lags. Methane flux from the flark surfaces seemed to respond rapidly to rainfall and changes in water table with a lag of zero or 1 day. In the lawn-low hummock, the lawn and one hummock site, methane flux showed a slow response with several days lag. This study strongly indicates that temperature, water table, and precipitation affect methane emissions with complex interactions.

AB Continuous water-table (WT) measurements from peatlands are scarce and - if existing at all-very short. Consequently, proxy indicators are critically needed to simulate hydrological changes in peatlands over longer time periods. In this study, we demonstrate that tree-ring width (TRW) records of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) growing in the Cepkeliai peatland (southern Lithuania) can be used as a proxy to reconstruct hydrological variability in a raised bog environment. A two-step modelling procedure was applied to extend existing measurements and to develop a new and longer peatland WT time series. To this end, we used instrumental WT measurements extending back to 2002, meteorological records, a P-PET (difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) series covering the period 1935-2014, so as to construct a tree-ring based time series of WT fluctuations at the site for the period 1870-2014. Strongest correlations were obtained between average annual WT measured at the bog margin and total P-PET over 7 years (r = 0.923, p < 0.00001), as well as between modelled WT and standardized TRW data with a two years lag (r = -0.602, p < 0.001) for those periods where WT fluctuated at the level of pine roots which is typically at <50 cm depth below the peat surface. Our results suggest that moisture is a limiting factor for tree growth at peatlands, but below a certain WT level (<50 cm under the soil surface), drought becomes a limiting factor instead. To validate the WT reconstruction from the Cepkeliai bog, results were compared to Nemunas river runoff since CE 1812 (r = 0.39, p < 0.00001, 1870-2014). We conclude that peatlands can act both as sinks and sources of greenhouse gases in case that hydrological conditions change, but that hydrological lags and complex feedbacks still hamper our understanding of several processes affecting the hydrology and carbon budget in peatlands. We therefore call for the development of further proxy records of water-table variability in peatlands to improve our understanding of peatland responses to climatic changes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Extracellular phenoloxidase enzymes play an important role in the stability of soil carbon storage by contributing to the cycling of complex recalcitrant phenolic compounds. Climate warming could affect peatland functioning through an alteration of polyphenol/phenoloxidase interplay, which could lead them to becoming weaker sinks of carbon. Here, we assessed the seasonal variability of total phenolics and phenoloxidases subjected to 2-3 degrees C increase in air temperature using open-top chambers. The measurements were performed along a narrow fen-bog ecological gradient over one growing season. Climate warming had a weak effect on phenoloxidases, but reduced phenolics in both fen and bog areas. Multivariate analyses revealed a split between the areas and also showed that climate warming exacerbated the seasonal variability of polyphenols, culminating in a destabilization of the carbon cycle. A negative relationship between polyphenols and phenoloxidases was recorded in controls and climate treatments suggesting an inhibitory effect of phenolics on phenoloxidases. Any significant decrease of phenolics through repeatedly elevated temperature would greatly impact the ecosystem functioning and carbon cycle through an alteration of the interaction of polyphenols with microbial communities and the production of extracellular enzymes. Our climate treatments did not have the same impact along the fen-bog gradient and suggested that not all the peatland habitats would respond similarly to climate forcing.

AB Increased decomposition rates in boreal peatlands with global warming might increase the release of atmospheric greenhouse gases, thereby producing a positive feedback to global warming. How temperature influences microbial decomposers is unclear. We measured in vitro rates of decomposition of senesced sedge leaves and rhizomes (Carex aquatilis), from a fen, and peat moss (Sphagnum fuscum), from a bog, at 14 and 20degreesC by the three most frequently isolated fungi and bacteria from these materials. Decomposition rates of the bog litter decreased (5- to 17-fold) with elevated temperatures, and decomposition of the sedge litters was either enhanced (2- to 30-fold) or remained unaffected by elevated temperatures. The increased temperature regime always favoured fungal over bacterial decomposition rates (2- to 3-fold). Different physiological characteristics of these microbes suggest that fungi using polyphenolic polymers as a carbon source cause greater mass losses of these litters. Litter quality exerted a stronger influence on decomposition at elevated temperatures, as litter rich in nutrients decomposed more quickly than litter poorer in nutrients at higher temperatures (8.0%-25.7% for the sedge litters vs. 0.2% for the bryophyte litter). We conclude that not all peatlands may provide a positive feedback to global warming. Cautious extrapolation of our data to the ecosystem level suggests that decomposition rates in fens may increase and those in bogs may decrease under a global warming scenario.

AB The North China Basin is the largest coal-bearing basin in China, and has an areal extent of 800,000 km(2). We analyzed 138 coal samples and in situ pillar coal samples of the middle Permian from this basin by macropetrography, microscope, scanning electron microscope, gas chromatography, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer in order to study wildfires. High contents of inertinite (charcoal) and natural coke particles observed in coal samples indicate that vegetation in precursor mires and peats of the middle Permian coal from north China was exposed to far-ranging wildfires. In addition, high-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were detected in the coal samples. These aromatic compounds were formed under high temperatures and provide further evidence of wildfire. These wildfires would have discharged significant CO and CO2 gases into the atmosphere and affected the paleoclimate and paleoecosystem.

AB Fens occur in many Colorado Rocky Mountain watersheds that have historically been affected by metal mining activities. A persistent effect of mining is acid rack drainage (ARD), which flows from mine adits and tailings piles. ARD water has low pH and high concentrations of heavy metals and can pollute surface and ground waters supporting fens. There are few floristic differences between polluted and pristine fens, and it is unclear what long-term affects ARD has on fens. We investigated decomposition of native leaf litter and a standard litter for two years in four Carer aquatilis-dominated subalpine fens. Two of the fens are affected by ARD, and their source waters have pH < 4.0 and high concentrations of dissolved Zn, Cu, Mn, and Pb. The other two fens are relatively pristine, with source water pH > 6.0 and low metal concentrations. ARD significantly reduced native litter decomposition rates over two years (ANOVA, p < 0.01), with 63% of the initial mass of leaf litter remaining at the most polluted site (Peru Creek fen), 47% at a moderately polluted site (Argentine fen), and 23% at the most pristine site (Deer Creek fen). ARD also reduced the quality of litter produced. Standard litter decomposed more rapidly than native litter at all sites, particularly Peru Creek fen. Site, representing fen environment, and litter origin, representing native vs, standard litter, significantly affected decomposition rates (ANOVA, p < 0.0001). Pristine fens had decomposition rates comparable with boreal rich fens, while polluted fens had decomposition rates comparable with boreal poor fens and bogs. Acid rock drainage causes ecosystem-level responses in organic matter processing, peat accumulation rates, and most likely in nutrient cycling, which could have long-term affects on fen primary and secondary production and other functions.

AB Peatlands encode information about past vegetation dynamics, climate, and microbial processes. Here, we used delta N-15 and delta C-13 patterns from 16 peat profiles to deduce how the biogeochemistry of the Marcell S1 forested bog in northern Minnesota responded to environmental and vegetation change over the past similar to 10 000 years. In multiple regression analyses, delta N-15 and delta C-13 correlated strongly with depth, plot location, C/N, %N, and each other. Correlations with %N, %C, C/N, and the other isotope accounted for 80% of variance for delta N-15 and 38% of variance for delta C-13, reflecting N and C losses. In contrast, correlations with depth and topography (hummock or hollow) reflected peatland successional history and climate. Higher delta N-15 in plots closer to uplands may reflect upland-derived DON inputs and accompanying shifts in N dynamics in the lagg drainage area surrounding the bog. The Suess effect (declining delta(CO2)-C-13 since the Industrial Revolution) lowered delta C-13 in recent surficial samples. High delta N-15 from -35 to -55 cm probably indicated the depth of ectomycorrhizal activity after tree colonization of the peatland over the last 400 years, as confirmed by the occasional presence of wood down to -35 cm depth. High delta C-13 at similar to 4000 years BP (-65 to -105 cm) could reflect a transition at that time to slower rates of peat accumulation, when C-13 discrimination during peat decomposition may increase in importance. Low delta C-13 and high delta N-15 at -213 and -225 cm (similar to 8500 years BP) corresponded to a warm period during a sedge-dominated rich fen stage. The above processes appear to be the primary drivers of the observed isotopic patterns, whereas there was no clear evidence for methane dynamics influencing delta C-13 patterns.

TI The stoichiometry of carbon and nutrients in peat formation
SO GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES

ID NITROGEN; PHOSPHORUS; EVERGLADES; DYNAMICS; CLIMATE
AB Northern peatlands have stored large amounts (similar to 500 Pg) of carbon (C) since the last glaciation. Combined with peat C are nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K), each of which plays an important role in plant production, litter decomposition, and the biogeochemical functioning of peatlands. Yet little attention has been given to the amounts of these nutrients stored in northern peatlands and their stoichiometry with C. Here we use data on nutrient concentrations in over 400 peat profiles in Ontario, Canada, representing bogs, fens, and swamps and their vegetation. We show that the C:N ratio is high (>40:1) in vegetation and litter but declines through the peat profiles to reach ratios between 22:1 and 29:1 in peat below 50 cm. In contrast, the C:P ratio rises from vegetation and litter (500:1 to 1300:1) to 1500:1 to 2000:1 in the lower part of the peat profile. Ratios of C to Ca, Mg, and K vary with peatland type. Most of these stoichiometric changes occur in the early stages of organic matter decomposition, where the litter structure remains intact. We estimate that similar to 18 Pg of N has been stored in northern peatlands since deglaciation, reflecting high N accumulation rates (similar to 0.8 gm(-2) yr(-1)), whereas P accumulation is small (similar to 0.3 Pg, similar to 0.016 gm(-2) yr(-1)), indicating that P is quickly recycled in the surface layers.

AB Lowering of the water table and substantial drying are observed in peatlands worldwide. A significant drying of European peatlands in the last 200-300 years influenced the vegetation, lowered carbon storage potential in peatlands, and modified microbial diversity. Here, we reconstructed in high resolution hydrological changes, local and extra-local vegetation composition, and fire activity based on a peat core from a Sphagnum-dominated peatland located in a young glacial landscape in Central Eastern Europe, NE Poland. The last ca. 1500 years of history of the Jaczno bog has been supported by a dense accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon (C-14) dating resolution: 20 dates per 400 cm of the peat profile. We also investigated changes in the functional and morphological traits of testate amoebae as well as the functional diversity of testate amoeba communities over time. Our reconstruction showed a rare case of hydrological stability in the peatland over the late Holocene, and no dry shifts were recorded during the study period. Relatively stable hydrological conditions and undisturbed Sphagnum growth enabled the bog to maintain notably high peat accumulation rates. Although increasing human impact has been recorded in the last ca. 400 years, we did not reconstruct strong disturbances (e.g., vast deforestations, intensive grazing or farming, fires) influencing the site. Compared with other hydrological records from Europe, the Jaczno bog was one of the few bogs in Central and Eastern Europe that did not experience drying during the Little Ice Age. Moreover, the traits and functional diversity of testate amoebae did not show any critical turnover. In the last 70 years, human impact on the site decreased, and the area became afforested. Unlike most of the European peatlands, the Jaczno bog possesses high water tables up to the present time. Therefore, our data suggest that nature conservation practices, which target high water tables, are essential to maintain peatlands as a sink and not as a source of carbon in the future.

AB Drainage for forestry purposes increases the depth of the oxic peat layer and leads to increased growth of shrubs and trees. Concurrently, the production and uptake of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) change: due to the accelerated decomposition of peat in the presence of oxygen, drained peatlands are generally considered to lose peat carbon (C). We measured CO2 exchange with the eddy co-variance (EC) method above a drained nutrient-poor peatland forest in southern Finland for 16 months in 2004-2005. The site, classified as a dwarf-shrub pine bog, had been ditched about 35 years earlier. CH4 and N2O fluxes were measured at 2-5-week intervals with the chamber technique. Drainage had resulted in a relatively little change in the water table level, being on average 40 cm below the ground in 2005. The annual net ecosystem exchange was -870 +/- 100 gCO(2) m-(2) yr(-1) in the calendar year 2005, indicating net CO2 uptake from the atmosphere. The site was a small sink of CH4 (-0.12 gCH(4) m(-2) yr(-1)) and a small source of N2O (0.10 gN(2)Om(-2) yr(-1)). Photosynthesis was detected throughout the year when the air temperature exceeded -3 degrees C. As the annual accumulation of C in the above and below ground tree biomass (175 +/- 35 gCm(-2)) was significantly lower than the accumulation observed by the flux measurement (240 +/- 30 gCm(-2)), about 65 g Cm-2 yr(-1) was likely to have accumulated as organic matter into the peat soil. This is a higher average accumulation rate than previously reported for natural northern peatlands, and the first time C accumulation has been shown by EC measurements to occur in a forestry-drained peatland. Our results suggest that forestry-drainage may significantly increase the CO2 uptake rate of nutrient-poor peatland ecosystems.

AB We present a high-resolution, continuous plant macrofossil remains record complemented by a pollen sequence from Tail Muced bog, in the Eastern Carpathian Mountains (Romania). The record spans the last 9000 years and we test whether peatland development in the Eastern Carpathians is linked to climate change or to autogenic succession. We find that Sphagnum magellanicum was the dominant peat-forming species for ca. 8000 years but we also identify ten phases of increased representation of Eriophorum vaginatum at approximately 8100, 7550, 6850, 6650, 5900, 4650, 3150, 1950, 1450, and 750 cal yr BP. Visual inspection and wavelet analysis show that the episodic increases in the relative abundances of Eriophorum vaginatum were simultaneous with decreased abundances of Sphagnum magellanicum and Sphagnum angustifolium. Comparison with published palaeoclimatic records in this region suggests that these cyclical successions of S. magellanicum and E. vaginatum appear to be primarily a result of climate changes, with E. vaginatum developing mainly during dry phases and S. magellanicum during wetter periods. We therefore suggest that the development of this peatland was largely influenced by changing climatic conditions, although the role of autogenic plant succession cannot be excluded. Our results show the value of ombrotrophic peat deposits as archives of past climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim To further unravel P availability in mineral-rich fens, and test whether high Fe in the soil would lead to low P availability to the vegetation. Methods Mesotrophic fens were selected over gradients in Ca and Fe in central Sweden and the Netherlands, to study characteristics of vegetation, pore water and peat soil, including inorganic and organic forms of P, Fe and Al. Results Soil Fe was more important than region or soil Ca, and P availability to the vegetation increased from Fe-poor to Fe-rich fens. Contrary to expectations, precipitation of iron phosphates played a minor role in Fe-rich fens. Fe-rich fens were P-rich for three reasons: (1) high P sorption capacity, (2) relatively weak sorption to Fe-OM complexes and (3) high amounts of sorbed organic P, which probably consists of labile P. Also, nonmycorrhizal wetland plants probably especially take up weakly sorbed (organic) P. However, high P did not lead to high biomass or low plant diversity. Fe-rich fens were limited by other nutrients, and high P may help protect the vegetation against Fe-toxicity. Conclusions Fe-poor fens are P-poor, irrespective of Ca, and Fe-rich fens P-rich even under mesotrophic conditions. However, high P itself does not endanger Fe-rich fens.

AB The objective of this research was to assess factors controlling peat and plant chemistry, and vegetation composition in 18 peatlands surrounding Sudbury after more than 30 years of large (>95%) pollution emission reductions. Sites closer to the main Copper Cliff smelter had more humified peat and the surface horizons were greatly enriched in copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni). Copper and Ni concentrations in peat were significantly correlated with that in the plant tissue of Chamaedaphne calyculata. The pH of peat was the strongest determining factor for species richness, diversity, and community composition, although percent vascular plant cover was strongly negatively correlated with surface Cu and Ni concentrations in peat. Sphagnum frequency was also negatively related to peat Cu and Ni concentrations indicating sites close to Copper Cliff smelter remain adversely impacted by industrial activities.

AB Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle due to their large C storage potential. Their C sequestration rates, however, highly vary depending on climatic and geohydrological conditions. Transitional mires are often characterised by floating peat with infiltration of buffered groundwater or surface water. Sphagnum mosses grow on top, producing recalcitrant organic matter and fuelling large C stocks. As Sphagnum species strongly differ in their tolerance to the higher pH in these mires, their species composition can be expected to influence C dynamics in transitional mires.
   We therefore experimentally determined growth and net C sequestration rates for four different Sphagnum species (Sphagnum squarrosum, S. palustre, S. fallax and S. magellanicum) in aquaria, with floating peat influenced by the infiltration of buffered water. Surprisingly, even though the first three species increased their biomass, the moss-covered peat still showed a net efflux of CO2 that was up to 3 times higher than that of bare peat. This species-dependent C release could be explained by Sphagnum's active lowering of the pH, which triggers the chemical release of CO2 from bicarbonate.
   Our results clearly illustrate that high Sphagnum biomass production may still coincide with high C emission. These counterintuitive C dynamics in mire succession seem to be the result of both species-and biomass-dependent acidification and buffered water infiltration. Together, these processes can explain part of the large variation in C fluxes (ranging from C sequestration to C release) reported for pristine mires in the literature.

AB According to the literature data and original research, the entomofauna of mire ecosystems in the Vologda Region has 465 species. Three orders have the largest number of species: Coleoptera - 156, Diptera - 97, and Lepidoptera - 50 species. In the trophic structure, zoophages are the most abundant (204 species), while the role of phytophages and saprophages is somewhat less (164 and 97 species, respectively). Seasonal and typological changes in the structure of terrestrial arthropods were studied in the model system, Shichengskoe mire, a large middle-taiga wetland (15.9 thousand ha). Three sampling plots were set within the mire (differing in vegetation, hydrological regime, and distance from the mire margin): a fen strip, a ridge-hollow site, and a mire stream valley at the mire margin. At each sampling plot, from May to September 2013, sampling was conducted using a sweeping net. The results showed that each studied mire site had unique features of the entomofauna structure and dynamics. The type of mire site had a more significant influence on the terrestrial insect fauna (F = 11.96, p = 0.0014) than the time of sampling (F = 3.61, p = 0.0278); the influence of sampling time is determined mainly by the seasonal changes in temperature course. Specific seasonal changes in the abundance of the insect trophic groups were found: saprophages, predators and parasites were the most abundant in June and July, while phytophages - at the end of the vegetation period.

AB Interpretation of proxy-climate records depends on a thorough understanding of the proxyclimate relationship. Peatland surface wetness records have been interpreted as reflecting changes between cool and/or wet conditions and warm and/or dry conditions. This paper analyses a high-resolution record of reconstructed water-table changes based on testate amoebae analysis in relation to instrumental weather records Since AD 1775. Replicate peat records are reconciled by multiple chronological techniques and tuning, and demonstrate that the reconstructions preserve many replicable high-frequency changes. Water-table variability is highly correlated with the total seasonal moisture deficit (precipitation evapotranspiration, P-E) expressed as the sum of all months with negative P-E. The reconstructed water-table record reflects antecedent periods of 5 or 10 years (maximum r(2) = 52.4%) and proxy bog surface wetness records can therefore be interpreted as reflecting the length and intensity of the summer water deficit period. Response surfaces of the summer deficit in relation to temperature and precipitation variability support the hypothesis that the summer deficit is determined by summer precipitation in mid-latitude oceanic peatlands and that summer temperature plays a greater but still subsidiary role in higher latitude, continental settings. These relationships apply for all plausible past Holocene climate changes and future twenty-first century climate scenarios. Non-linear responses to longer-term climate states prevent the direct application of a calibration of the reconstructed water-table records to infer quantitative estimates of climate variables. Models that combine peat accumulation, mire growth and hydrological processes are required to undertake this task.

ID TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; COMMUNITIES; COMPETITION; DIVERSITY
AB Prairie fens, rare peatland features of the landscape of the midwestern United States, are often fire-managed to restore or maintain species diversity and prevent shrub and tree invasion. We quantified the effects of such management at Bluff Spring Pen Nature Preserve (Cook County, Illinois, USA), where eight dormant-season prescription burns supplemented by shrub cutting took place from 1982 to 1992. Baseline transects established across the fen in 1986-87 were resampled in 1992 in relatively undisturbed spring run/marl flat, calcareous seep, graminoid fen, and sedge meadow communities, and in disturbed graminoid fen vegetation where woody plant invasion and species change had occurred after previous grazing and fire suppression. Analyses of plot richness or diversity found no significant temporal changes. Correlation coefficients and indices of floristic similarity and coefficients of conservatism were sensitive to significant vegetation changes in sedge meadow and in disturbed fen habitats, but no: in less-disturbed vegetation. More rigorous analyses found significant temporal changes throughout the fen, which paralleled known fire effects on grassland. In most relatively undisturbed communities, combined frequencies of graminoid species increased, forb frequencies decreased, and woody vegetation remained unchanged. At the species level, this pattern was supported by significant increases in cover of most dominant grasses and sedges. The decline in overall forb frequency was cumulative, as few individual forb species declined in cover or frequency. One exception was the common fen goldenrod Solidago ohioensis, which decreased in cover but not frequency in two communities. Disturbed fen underwent structural and successional changes that varied with habitat. Gray dogwood (Cornus racemosa), the most aggressive invader of disturbed fen, was more resistant to fire and cutting in unshaded fen and less resilient and more controllable in partial shade of bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa). The prairie grass Andropogon gerardii increased only in unshaded areas of disturbed fen. Successional changes in herbaceous species included loss of alien species and gain of prevalent fen species, although some species that appear to represent late-successional graminoid fen have not yet appeared in disturbed graminoid fen. More precise and frequent monitoring and experimental management treatments are needed to determine the relevance of these findings. Because Cornus racemosa is also present in higher quality graminoid fen and in calcareous seep, continued control of woody vegetation may be required; it is doubtful that dormant-season prescribed burning or cutting without application of appropriate herbicides can eliminate this resilient species.

AB Peatland open-water pools, a common feature on temperate to subarctic peatlands, are sources of carbon (C) to the atmosphere but their contribution to the net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange (NEE-CO2) is poorly known; there is a question as to whether peatlands with pools are smaller sinks of atmospheric C, or even C-neutral, compared to other peatlands. We present growing season NEE-CO2 measurements using the eddy covariance technique in a peatland with pools. We found the maximum photosynthetic uptake and ecosystem respiration rates at 10 degrees C to be in the lower range of the published data. The lower total vegetation biomass, due to the presence of pools, reduced CO2 uptake during day and the autotrophic component of ecosystem respiration. The low CO2 uptake combined with reduced CO2 loss resulted in the site being a net sink for CO2 of a similar magnitude as other northern peatlands despite the inclusion of pools.

TI The long-term fate of permafrost peatlands under rapid climate warming
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID CARBON ACCUMULATION; PEAT
AB Permafrost peatlands contain globally important amounts of soil organic carbon, owing to cold conditions which suppress anaerobic decomposition. However, climate warming and permafrost thaw threaten the stability of this carbon store. The ultimate fate of permafrost peatlands and their carbon stores is unclear because of complex feedbacks between peat accumulation, hydrology and vegetation. Field monitoring campaigns only span the last few decades and therefore provide an incomplete picture of permafrost peatland response to recent rapid warming. Here we use a high-resolution palaeoecological approach to understand the longer-term response of peatlands in contrasting states of permafrost degradation to recent rapid warming. At all sites we identify a drying trend until the late-twentieth century; however, two sites subsequently experienced a rapid shift to wetter conditions as permafrost thawed in response to climatic warming, culminating in collapse of the peat domes. Commonalities between study sites lead us to propose a five-phase model for permafrost peatland response to climatic warming. This model suggests a shared ecohydrological trajectory towards a common end point: inundated Arctic fen. Although carbon accumulation is rapid in such sites, saturated soil conditions are likely to cause elevated methane emissions that have implications for climate-feedback mechanisms.

AB This study compared the energy budget components of latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H), net radiation (Rn) and ground heat flux (G) between an undisturbed bog and an adjacent abandoned peatland pasture within the same peatland complex in western Newfoundland, Canada. The analysis was based on the period of April 2014 to August 2015 when measurements were concurrent at both sites, thus encompassing two growing seasons. The overall objective was to identify the impact of agricultural management and abandonment on peatland energy flux and partitioning. LE and H showed strong seasonal patterns for both sites. LE, which was higher at the pasture, peaked near the middle of the growing season. H at the bog was smaller than that at the pasture during the early growing season, but became larger during the middle and late growing seasons, with the maximum H occurring during the early growing season. G was the smallest flux in the energy budget at both sites, and it showed no obvious temporal pattern at either site. The variation in daytime average evapo-transpiration (ET) was related to net radiation and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) at both sites. However, it was more strongly related to Rn. ET at the pasture site exhibited greater sensitivity to changes in Rn and VPD. Daytime ET increased and decreased with water table depth (WTD) when WTD was above and below a threshold of -0.24 m at the bog and -0.46 m at the pasture. The between-site differences in growing season H and LE (Delta H and Delta LE) were mainly caused by their different vegetation conditions, and Delta H and Delta LE were negatively and positively related to Delta EVI (difference in enhanced vegetation index), respectively.

   SOIL CARBON; STORAGE; CLIMATE; CYCLE
AB The carbon density and the long-term (apparent) rate of carbon accumulation (LORCA) in the mineral subsoil of boreal mires in Finland formed by paludification were studied by comparison to adjacent forest soil sites with similar podzolic texture and topography. On the basis of 273 soil profiles from six areas, the mean carbon density in the mineral subsoil of mire sites was 1.5-fold higher than in adjacent forest profiles. The average carbon input was 13.6 +/- 1.8 (SE) g m(-2) yr(-1), which differed according to length of time since the onset of paludification. LORCA estimates were highest on the youngest mire sites (< 500 years) and agree with estimates obtained for peat deposits elsewhere in the boreal region. Bogs and topographically flat areas were found to have higher LORCA values than the fens and the topographically steeper areas. The carbon stored in podzols in boreal forest reach equilibrium with soil age after 1500-2000 years, while in the mineral subsoil of mires the equilibrium is reached after 4500-5000 pears after initial paludification. A direct comparison of carbon below mires to the equivalent depths of peat above indicates that peats are much more efficient in C sequestration. In this study, the average total C density in the mineral subsoil of mire areas to a depth of 70 cm from the bottom of the A horizon would correspond to a peat depth of about 18 cm. Still, the mineral subsoil under mires is a significant carbon sink, hitherto overlooked, and could account for some 5% of the unaccounted for carbon in the global carbon budget.

AB As natural sources of methane (CH4), peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Climate models predict that evapotranspiration will increase under a 2 x CO2 scenario due to increased temperatures leading to lowered water tables at many northern latitudes. Given that the position of the water table within a peatland can have a large effect on CH4 emissions, climate change may alter the CH4 emissions from peatlands in this area. Research was conducted during 2001-2003 on natural and drained (8 years prior) sites within a poor fen in central Quebec. Flux measurements were made for each site at different microtopographical features that varied in depth to water table and vegetation cover. The quantity of CH4 dissolved in the pore water was measured in the field and the potential of the peat for CH4 production and consumption was determined in the laboratory. Methane emissions and storage were lower in the drained fen. Growing season CH4 emissions at the drained site were 55% lower than the control site, primarily due to significantly reduced fluxes from topographic highs (up to 97% reduction), while the flux from topographically low areas remained high. The maintenance of high fluxes at these hollow sites was related to hydrological and ecological effects of the water table drawdown. The removal of standing water removed a potential zone of CH4 oxidation. It also enabled plant colonization at these locations, leading to an increase in gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP). At the hollow sites, seasonal CH4 emissions were significantly correlated to seasonal GEP (R-2 = 0.85). These results suggest that the response of northern peatland CH4 dynamics to climate change depends on the antecedent moisture conditions of the site. Moreover, ecological succession can play an important role for determining future CH4 emissions, particularly from wetter sites.

AB The fire history and the effect of fires on the long-term (apparent) rate of carbon accumulation (LORCA) in the Patvinsuo mire complex, eastern Finland, were determined through stratigraphic and pollen analyses of 98 pear cores. The peat cores were characterized by a large number of charcoal layers and the age of the basal peat varied between 57 and 10 500 years. Mire fires slowed down the progress of vertical peat accumulation and resulted in great carbon losses. The average LORCA in the Patvinsuo cores was clearly lower, 9.2 +/- 1.0 (SE) g m(-2) yr(-1), compared to the average Value for all mire sites in the southern half of Finland, 17.7 +/- 0.6 (SE) g m(-2) yr(-1). The average rate of carbon loss in Patvinsuo mire complex was 9.5 +/- 1.0 (SE) g m(-2) yr(-1) and the mean carbon loss in an individual fire was estimated to be 2.5 kg m(-2).

AB The relationships between the distribution of plant communities and environmental factors were studied in an open peatland - forest complex of the hypermaritime north coast of British Columbia. The entire vegetation gradient, from open through forested peatlands to upland forest, was primarily explained by slope and minimum level of groundwater table. Environmental conditions in the upland Tsuga-Rhytidiadelphus forest were considerably different from those of the other communities; differences were small among the Sphagnum open peatland, the Pinus-Sphagnum woodland, the Chamaecyparis-Fauria forest, and the Thuja-Gaultheria forest. Highest level of groundwater table, conductivity minimum, pH, and dissolved oxygen merely helped distinguish the upland Tsuga-Rhytidiadelphus forest from all other communities. The wet Thuja-Gaultheria forest could be more vulnerable than the upland Tsuga-Rhytidiadelphus forest to local hydrological changes caused by harvesting. Consecutive intraannual measurements of environmental variables are important in clarifying the relationships between distribution of plant communities and environmental variables, especially for communities with peat accumulation.

AB Studies examining the decomposition rates of belowground plant tissues in peatlands are scarce despite the significant contribution these tissues make to total plant production. Therefore, we measured mass losses of Carex aquatilis Wahlenb. leaves and rhizomes and Salix planifolia Pursh leaves and roots in a rich, sedge-dominated fen and Sphagnum fuscum (Schimp.) Klinggr. plants in a forested bog using the litter bag technique over a 2-year period in southern boreal Alberta. After 2 years, mass losses of C. aquatilis rhizomes (75%) were significantly higher than those of C. aquatilis leaves and Salix planifolia leaves, which were similar to each other (54 and 48%, respectively). Sphagnum fuscum and Salix planifolia root mass losses also were similar to each other (21 and 29%, respectively), but they were significantly lower than those of the other three litter types. Different tissue nutrient concentrations as well as alkalinity- and phosphorus-related surface water chemistry variables correlated significantly with mass losses of different litter types; however, they alone did not explain all of the mass loss trends. The majority of sedge peat and carbon in the fen originates from C. aquatilis leaves (188 and 86 g.m(-2), respectively), with the remainder originating from C. aquatilis rhizomes (102 and 47 g.m(-2), respectively) after the first 2 years of decomposition. Conversely, the majority of Salix planifolia peat and carbon originates from its roots (33 and 16 g.m(-2), respectively) and the remainder from its leaves (24 and 11 g.m(-2), respectively) over the same period. After the first 2 years of decomposition, 150 g.m(-2) of peat and 71 g.m(-2) of carbon remained from the decomposing Sphagnum fuscum in the bog.

AB Aboveground net primary production (NPP) and surface water chemistry variables were monitored in a lacustrine sedge fen and a bog for four years. There were no significant differences in precipitation, mean growing season annual temperature, and number of growing degree days from 1991 to 1994. The mean annual water levels in the lacustrine sedge fen differed significantly, whereas they were similar in the bog during these four years. We measured 15 surface water variables in the lacustrine sedge fen and the bog, and found that only two correlated significantly with water level fluctuations. In the lacustrine sedge fen, calcium correlated positively (r(2) = 0.56) and nitrate correlated negatively (r(2) = 0.20) with water levels. In the bog, potassium correlated positively (r(2) = 0.88) and total dissolved phosphorus correlated negatively (r(2) = 0.62) with water levels. The remaining chemical variables showed no significant correlations with water level fluctuations.
   Net primary production of the different vegetation strata appeared to respond to different environmental variables. In the lacustrine sedge fen, graminoid production was explained to a significant degree by water levels (r(2) = 0.53), whereas shrub production was explained to a significant degree by surface water chemistry variables, such as nitrate (r(2) = 0.74) and total phosphorus (r(2) = 0.22). In the bog, temperature was the only variable that explained moss production to a significant degree (r(2) = 0.71), whereas ammonium explained graminoid production (r(2) = 0.66) and soluble reactive phosphorus explained shrub production to significant degrees (r(2) = 0.71).
   There are few direct data on the impact of climatic warming in boreal wetlands, although paleoecological and 2xCO(2) model data have provided some indications of past and possibly future changes in vegetation composition, respectively. Our results suggest that the lacustrine sedge fen may succeed to a bog dominated by Sphagnum spp. and Picea mariana, whereas the bog may succeed to an upland-type forest ecosystem.

AB The application of drones has recently revolutionised the mapping of wetlands due to their high spatial resolution and the flexibility in capturing images. In this study, the drone imagery was used to map key vegetation communities in an Irish wetland, Clara Bog, for the spring season. The mapping, carried out through image segmentation or semantic segmentation, was performed using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. With the aim of identifying the most appropriate, cost-efficient, and accurate segmentation method, multiple ML classifiers and DL models were compared. Random forest (RF) was identified as the best pixel-based ML classifier, which provided good accuracy (approximate to 85%) when used in conjunction graph cut algorithm for image segmentation. Amongst the DL networks, a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture in a transfer learning framework was utilised. A combination of ResNet50 and SegNet architecture gave the best semantic segmentation results (approximate to 90%). The high accuracy of DL networks was accompanied with significantly larger labelled training dataset, computation time and hardware requirements compared to ML classifiers with slightly lower accuracy. For specific applications such as wetland mapping where networks are required to be trained for each different site, topography, season, and other atmospheric conditions, ML classifiers proved to be a more pragmatic choice.

AB Due to agricultural intensification and cessation of traditional land use, alkaline fens of the Caricion davallianae alliance (EU-FFH 7230) are among the most endangered ecosystems in Europe. This study exhibits a vegetation analysis of these systems in Schleswig-Holstein (Northern Germany). We analyzed across three scales the effects of grazing and mowing on phytodiversity of core areas and recorded their adjacent vegetation to estimate the capability for habitat enlargement of fen species. Results revealed that species richness, evenness and number of endangered species varied insignificantly between mowing and grazing treatments, regardless of scale. The high proportion of fen species and Red-Book-listed species in core areas, along with a state-wide representation of only 2 ha of these vegetation types, underlines the need for further conservation measures. Floristic differences between grazed and mowed sites derived from the individual appearance of species within one treatment. Thus, to preserve the species pool of alkaline fens, both management strategies have to be considered. Moreover, as most small sedge reed species are low-productive and light-demanding, sufficient biomass removal of dominant tall-growing species is required. One cut per year in late summer, the traditional management, does not satisfy the requirements of target species, which is indicated by an increase of Phragmitetea species at larger plot sizes. Additionally, in grazed fens, vegetation adjacent to the core areas consisted mainly of more eutrophic wet grasslands, and, in mowed fens, mainly of reeds or woods. We recommend therefore several changes in current conservation measures that include an increase to two cuts per year in mowed fens, and stocking rates of at least 2 LU ha(-1) (summer grazing) or 0.7 LU ha(-1) (year-round grazing).

AB We studied the biomass production of moss species typical of pine-dominated drained peatland forests to evaluate their potential role in the carbon cycle of such sites. The study was carried out at two sites in Lakkasuo, central Finland. Prior to drainage, the sites had been mesotrophic and ombrotrophic. Shoots of Pleurozium schreberi, Sphagnum angustifolium, S. fuscum, S. magellanicum and S. russowii were marked in the autumn of 2004 and 2005, incorporated back in the original patches, recovered one year later, and measured for height growth, biomass, and biomass production. Biomass production varied from 16 to 388 g dry mass m(-2) yr(-1). Both height growth and biomass production were higher at the mesotrophic site, while biomass estimates did not show distinct difference between sites. Variation in production within each dominant species was considerable. A simulation with our production values and published estimates of decomposition rates showed that these species have the potential to contribute significantly to soil carbon storage in drained peatlands.

AB Drought has major impacts on microbial decomposition and net N- and P-release in peat. The separate effects of aeration (oxygen intrusion) during moderate drought and desiccation (oxygen intrusion plus water deficiency) during severe drought are, however, poorly understood. This information is vital to understand the biogeochemical and ecological effects of different gradations of drought in peatlands. In addition, effects may differ between rich fen peat and Sphagnum-dominated poor fen peat. We therefore conducted a controlled incubation experiment involving both soil types to quantify the rates of decomposition, net N-mineralization, net P-release, denitrification, and the partitioning of C, N and P in soils and microbial biomass under three different incubation conditions. Soils were incubated under (1) anaerobic, waterlogged conditions, (2) aerobic, moist conditions, characteristic for moderate drought in which oxygen intrusion takes place, and (3) aerobic, desiccated conditions to simulate severe drought.
   Our results show that under anaerobic, waterlogged conditions, net N-mineralization rates per mass dry peat soil and per microbial C mass were much higher (on average 10 times) in the Sphagnum-peat than in peat from rich fens, probably caused by higher microbial N-demand and N-immobilization in rich fens. The response upon aeration differed greatly between rich fen peat and Sphagnum-peat. Whereas aeration led to increased carbon loss and net N-mineralization rates in the rich fen peat, these rates did not change for Sphagnum-peat. The absence of aeration effects in Sphagnum-dominated fens suggests that decomposition rates are more strongly determined by litter quality than by oxygen intrusion. Upon further desiccation, both net P-release and DOC production, which remained unchanged upon aeration, increased significantly in both fen types. This may be due to microbial mortality and/or a change in microbial composition. The low anaerobic net N-mineralization rates and the strong response to aeration in rich fens compared to Sphagnum-fens, as well as the strong increase in P-availability upon further desiccation in both fen types, have important implications for peatland management in relation to drought.

AB Peatland rewetting is a widely used restoration technique, yet the recovery of anaerobic processes is poorly characterized. Microbes involved in anaerobic processes, especially methanogens, could reflect the stabilization of anaerobic conditions, vegetation succession and overall restoration success.
   We investigated the effect of long-term drainage and hydrological rewetting on methanogenic abundance, community composition and CH4 production potential in bogs and spruce swamp forests. Additionally, the substrate limitation of methanogens was tested with a focus on original peatland plant species and their spreading after rewetting by addition of natural substrates.
   Drainage strongly reduced the abundance and diversity of the methanogenic community. After rewetting, methanogenic abundance and community composition reached almost a pristine-like state, however their CH4 production remained as low as in the drained sites. Substrate addition confirmed the substrate limitation of methanogens due to strongly decomposed peat and the slow spreading of original peatland vegetation. The addition of natural substrates supported methanogenesis close to a pristine-like level. The limited CH4 production reflected not fully recovered anaerobic microbial community composition and vegetation structure 7-16 years after rewetting, although anaerobic conditions seemed to stabilize. Thus, the reestablishment of peatland vegetation structure is crucial for the recovery of methanogenic activity and microbial processes in rewetted peatlands. Moreover, methanogenic community composition, abundance and activity could be used as indicators of restoration success.
   Originality significant statement: Peatland drainage is increasingly recognized as a major problem affecting the status of valuable natural habitats, water quality and global carbon balance. Rewetting projects are set up to combat and mitigate the losses; yet not enough is known about the recovery of anaerobic processes, especially methanogenesis, which are assumed to reflect stabilization of anaerobic conditions and overall restoration success. Forestry-drained spruce swamp forests and bogs, common in northern Europe, are currently rewetted for both nature conservation purposes and for their anticipated function as hydrological buffers, but information on the recovery of anaerobic microbial communities and especially methanogens are only partly known.
   Our study concerns the effect of long-term drainage and hydrological rewetting on methanogenic abundance, community composition and activity (CH4 production potential) in undrained, drained and rewetted bogs and spruce swamp forests in the Bohemian Forest, Central Europe. We searched for a reason of limited methanogenic activity in rewetted sites by addition of natural substrates simulating the spreading of original peatland plants (Sphagnum, sedges). This paper contributes to scientific understanding on how long it takes for rewetted peatlands to recover anaerobic microbial communities, anaerobic processes and what are the crucial factors in this process. These results provides a basis for further studies on the trophic relations between anaerobic microbes and recovery of the drained peatlands after rewetting. This study can also extend a set of indicators which should be use for restoration progress evaluation.

AB The developmental stages, hydrological conditions, and net peat accumulation rates at three coring sites of Pare de Frontenac Peatland (Quebec) were reconstructed to examine the role of climate on pent accumulation. During the early to mid-Holocene, elevated temperatures proved to be a more critical factor for sustained peat production than precipitation, because peatland development occurred mostly under a dry climate according to a low lake-level stage lasting from 11000 to 7000 calibrated (cal.) BP in a nearby lake. Between 7000 and 6000 cal, BP, elevated net pent accumulation rates roughly correspond with a rise in lake water level, suggesting that higher precipitation and (or) less evapotranspiration then favored peat growth. A decrease in peat accumulation occurred from 5000 to 2500-1500 cal. BP, while the lake level was high from 4400 cal. BP. An important increase in net pent accumulation rate is recorded for this entire peatland from 1500 cal. BP. Lack of close timing between fake level changes and changes in pent accumulation rates or surface hydrology suggest that temperature and autogenic processes were often more important than regional water balance in the developmental history of the peatland.

AB The coast-line evolution and vegetation from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ca.25 ka cal AP) until the middle Holocene are reconstructed from a digital terrain model and a postglacial sea level curve and pollen analysis of a Donatia-Astelia cushion bog located in Punta Moat (Moat-2; 54 degrees 58'50'' S, 66 degrees 44'10"W; 40 m s.n.m.), east Beagle Channel. The evolution of plant communities at eastern mouth of the Beagle Channel is broadly in line with the regional postglacial vegetation pattern in areas devoid of ice south of Tierra del Fuego. The regional pattern of postglacial vegetation shows steppe followed by forest-steppe and closed Nothofagus forest. Prior 17,700 cal yr BP, the onset of deglaciation in the Beagle Channel in the current study area of Punta Moat and, the removal of alpine paleoglaciers to the headwaters of the valleys and cirques of Sierra Lucio Lopez, led the formation of an alluvial plain with streams flowing in a perpendicular direction to the current channel. During the early Holocene (11,500-8,000 cal yr BP), the vegetation was similar to that developed in the western and central sectors of the Beagle Channel. However, the influence of the relative rise of the sea-level and the marine spray-humidity favored the early development of Nothofagus forest in Punta Moat. By 9,500 cal yr BP the landscape showed the physiognomy of a closed forest. Meanwhile on the peat bog, the Sphagnum-cushion plant mixed type prevailed, including floristic elements characteristics of the Magellanic Moorland, due to mineral input from sea spray in coincidence with the opening of channels and the Picton and Nueva islands formation. Towards the ca. 7,000 cal yr BP, the Magellanic Moorland and the Subantarctic Evergreen Forest developed when the coast-line configuration was similar than today.

AB Predictive understanding of northern peatland hydrology is a necessary precursor to understanding the fate of massive carbon stores in these systems under the influence of present and future climate change. Current models have begun to address microtopographic controls on peatland hydrology, but none have included a prognostic calculation of peatland water table depth for a vegetated wetland, independent of prescribed regional water tables. We introduce here a new configuration of the Community Land Model (CLM) which includes a fully prognostic water table calculation for a vegetated peatland. Our structural and process changes to CLM focus on modifications needed to represent the hydrologic cycle of bogs environment with perched water tables, as well as distinct hydrologic dynamics and vegetation communities of the raised hummock and sunken hollow microtopography characteristic of peatland bogs. The modified model was parameterized and independently evaluated against observations from an ombrotrophic raised-dome bog in northern Minnesota (S1-Bog), the site for the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climatic and Environmental Change experiment (SPRUCE). Simulated water table levels compared well with site-level observations. The new model predicts hydrologic changes in response to planned warming at the SPRUCE site. At present, standing water is commonly observed in bog hollows after large rainfall events during the growing season, but simulations suggest a sharp decrease in water table levels due to increased evapotranspiration under the most extreme warming level, nearly eliminating the occurrence of standing water in the growing season. Simulated soil energy balance was strongly influenced by reduced winter snowpack under warming simulations, with the warming influence on soil temperature partly offset by the loss of insulating snowpack in early and late winter. The new model provides improved predictive capacity for seasonal hydrological dynamics in northern peatlands, and provides a useful foundation for investigation of northern peatland carbon exchange.

AB Hummock and hollow inhabiting Sphagnum mosses form a monolayer in bog vegetation, and competition between species can be viewed as an interference for space. In a long-term study (up to 11 years), patches of the hummock species S. fuscum and the hollow species S. balticum and S. tenellum were reciprocally transplanted, and species interactions monitored by measuring the area covered by each species. When hollow species were transplanted into the hummocks they dried out, and their cover declined rapidly. The coverage of S. balticum stabilised after ca 5 years at a low level, which supports the idea that the surrounding hummock species has a positive effect on its water balance. Sphagnum tenellum, which itself has a poor water transport ability, disappeared almost totally when grown in the S. fuscum-dominated hummocks.
   Sphagnum fuscum decreased initially in the hollows but recovered and showed a highly variable result after a decade, with an increase in area in many cases. It was not extinguished by the hollow species in any one case. These long-term results do not support the hypothesis that it is excluded from the hollows by competition, but the treatments did not include the wettest parts of the hollows. Among the hollow species S. balticum seemed to have a competitive advantage, but the trend was reversed in one year when S. tenellum regained area. This result stresses the importance of long-term experiments. There were also other instances when the conclusions drawn from the long-term monitoring differed from those reached after 4-5 years.
   The results suggest that these closely related species were on average rather similar in competitive ability in the hollows, but results varied considerably between nominal replicates. Competition also varied seasonally: S. balticum often lost area to S. fuscum and won area from S. tenellum in the autumn, with a compensation for these changes earlier in the summer. Variation in water level within habitat could not be shown to affect the outcome of competition between species.

AB Large areas of UK peatland were planted with non-native conifers in the twentieth century, changing many aspects of the ecosystem. As these plantations reach harvesting age there are important questions about what should be done with them next, with key options including restocking for continued forestry and restoration. Making decisions on the future of these sites is difficult and the underlying evidence base is often incomplete. In order to prioritise future evidence needs we conducted a two-phase consultation exercise to identify what a large body of stakeholders in science, policy and practice consider to be the most important outstanding research questions. The five most popular questions identified were: How does the greenhouse gas balance of peatland forestry differ between deep and shallow peat and compare to forestry on mineral soils?; How does the greenhouse gas budget of a peatland change with initial afforestation, restocking or restoration?; Is it possible to have trees on peat without loss of biodiversity and carbon storage?; What are the limits to the achievability of forest-to-bog restoration in terms of factors such as peat condition, depth and site extent?; and What is the financial value of natural capital in natural and afforested peatlands and how does this change with restoration? Notable subsidiary themes included flooding, biodiversity and compensatory planting. These questions form potential foci for future research and particularly emphasise the importance of understanding carbon cycling in afforested peatlands.

AB Climatic reconstruction from peat deposits is an important aspect of Quaternary research. Previous studies of the peatlands in the Mu Us Desert in northern China have focused on the processes of paleoclimatic evolution, but the history of peatland development remains unclear due to the absence of comparative studies. Here we present a synthesis of the available records documenting peatland development within the Mu Us Desert since the last deglaciation. We combine paleoclimatic records from profiles from two new sites with previously published results from 12 sites. Our aim is to reconstruct the temporal and spatial record of peatland development and to determine its driving forces. The results show that the peatlands developed in two phases: from similar to 15ka until the early Holocene and from 6.5-3ka when there was a significant expansion of their spatial extent. These phases correspond to two distinct types of paludification process, and both were closely related to changes in the East Asian monsoon. A final stage after 2ka resulted from the significant weakening of the monsoon, during which peat accumulation ceased.

AB Peatlands are important to global carbon (C) sequestration and surface water acid-base status, both of which are affected by peatland alkalinity and acidity cycling. Relationships among sulfate (SO4 (2-)), nitrate (NO3 (-)), organic acids (OA(-)), base cations (i.e., Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na+), proton (H+) acidity, and bicarbonate (HCO3 (-)) alkalinity were investigated in an intermediate fen peatland in northern Ontario during 2004 (an average precipitation year) and 2005 (a dry summer). Potential evapotranspiration was higher and the water table, groundwater input from the uplands, and runoff were lower during 2005. Net inputs of base cations, HCO3 (-), SO4 (2-), and OA(-), and to a lesser degree NO3 (-), were lower during the drier year, mainly due to lower groundwater transfer to the fen. Fen porewater HCO3 (-) concentration and net output were also lower in the drier year, whereas Ca2+, Mg2+, and SO4 (2-) concentrations and net output were higher. During the climatically average year, N immobilization, carbonic acid (H2CO3) dissociation, and OA dissociation were equally important H+-producing reactions. Peat cation exchange accounted for 50% of the H+ sink, while SO4 (2-) reduction and denitrification accounted for an additional 20 and 25% of the H+ sink, respectively. During the dry year, S oxidation accounted for 55% of the H+ net production, while that for H2CO3 dissociation was 70% lower than that during the climatically average year. Peat cation exchange consumed three times the acidity, and accounted for 92% of the H+ consumption during the dry year compared to the climatically average year. This was consistent with a three-fold higher net base cation export from the fen during the dry year. Based on the study results, a conceptual model was developed that describes the role of acidity formation and its implications to intermediate fen acidification.

AB On the basis of the review of available literature sources, the approaches to the systematics of peat soils in different soil classifications systems (Russian, German, FAO-UNESCO, WRB, and Soil Taxonomy) are discussed and compared with the landscape-based classifications of boreal mires. Among the diagnostic criteria, the most important in the systematics of peat soils and peatlands are the peat thickness, trophic status as the availability of nutrients and as a botanical concept, and acidity (pH) of peat and peat waters. The following suggestions are made: (a) to establish the peat thickness >= 30 cm as a criterion for peat soils, (b) to exclude the contents of nutrients in the peat from the diagnostic scheme for peat soils, and (c) to develop this scheme on the basis of geobotanical indicators. The latter may include active peat-forming plants, as well as plant species settling on the regressive mires under conditions of a cessation or drastic slowdown of peat accumulation. It is also recommended that the type of mesotrophic peat soils should be added to the Russian soil classification system and that the subtype of wet regressive soils should be distinguished within the oligotrophic type of peat soils along with the existing subtype of destructive soils.

AB We investigated the impact of watershed liming on elemental concentrations in the shrubs Myrica gale and Chamaedaphne calculata and the sedge Carer stricta. We analyzed tissues from plants co-occurring in 1-m(2) plots in limed and unlimed portions bf an Adirondack poor fen for Al, B, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, N, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Se, V, and Zn. Within 2 years of liming, we found higher concentrations of Ca, Ni, and Zn and lower N, Na, and Mn in Chamaedaphne foliage; higher Fe, K, Mg, Ni, Pb, and Zn and lower Co and Mn in Chamaedaphne twigs; higher Mo and lower Al, B, Mn, and Ni in Myrica foliage; higher Al, Cr, and Mo and lower Cd, Mn, and Se in Myrica twigs; and higher Al and lower Co and Cir in Carer foliage. Clearly, each species was unique in its uptake and allocation of elements, which will influence the rate these elements cycle in this watershed after liming. Elements in Carer foliage changed the least after watershed liming, while those in Chamaedaphne twigs changed the most. However, the slow decay of Chamaedaphne litter will likely inhibit the release of accumulated elements, including Ca.

AB Despite visual similarities between marshes and moderate-rich fens in the southern part of the western boreal forest of Canada, there are ecological and functional differences between the two wetland classes. Western boreal marshes have received little attention and are often difficult to distinguish from moderate-rich fens in appearance, especially when both are located at the edges of ponds and small lakes. We examined species assemblages, net above-ground production, decomposition, nutrient cycling, and environmental characteristics in five wetlands, all with approximately I m of peat. Based on TWINSPAN and DCCA, both wetland classes contain Carex aquatilis, but marshes were characterized by Carex utriculata, Carex atherodes, Lemna minor, Typha latifolia, and no mosses. Fens were characterized by Carex lasiocarpa and various species of brown mosses, and overall, they were more variable in species composition. There were also functional differences between the classes, with net above-ground production (especially vascular plant production) greater in marshes. Decomposition rates were higher in marshes, with Carex mass losses of 86% compared to 73% in the fens after 506 days. Comparisons of our data with previous years also indicate that high water levels promote decomposition and suggest that differences in the decomposition rates between marshes and fens may ultimately be controlled by hydrologic conditions and not surface-water nutrient dynamics. Nutrient dynamics and concentrations differed between wetland classes. Concentrations of phosphorus were higher in marsh plants and lower in the peat soil than in fens. Nitrogen concentrations were higher in marsh peat than fen peat. Based on the N:P quotients of the dominant vegetation, plants in both wetlands were more limited by available N than P. Surface-water concentrations of all nutrients were higher in marshes than fens, although even the fens can be considered eutrophic, with total phosphor-us concentrations averaging approximately 100 mug L-1. Surface-water levels were generally higher in the marshes, and 90% of the variation in environmental variables between the two peatland classes could be explained by surface-water level, alkalinity, chloride, ammonium, and potassium. Thus, we found that marshes and moderate-rich fens have characteristic species assemblages and that these two wetland classes can be distinguished based on environmental variables and ecosystem functions, despite the strong visual similarities between some fens and marshes.

AB Flux-chamber measurements of greenhouse gas exchanges between the soil and the atmosphere represent a snapshot of the conditions on a particular site and need to be combined or used in some way to provide integrated fluxes for the longer time periods that are often of interest. In contrast to carbon dioxide (CO2), most studies that have estimated the time-integrated flux of CH4 on ombrotrophic peatlands have not used models. Typically, linear interpolation is used to estimate CH4 fluxes during the time periods between flux-chamber measurements. CH4 fluxes generally show a rise followed by a fall through the growing season that may be captured reasonably well by interpolation, provided there are sufficiently frequent measurements. However, day-to-day and week-to-week variability is also often evident in CH4 flux data, and will not necessarily be properly represented by interpolation. Using flux chamber data from a UK blanket peatland, we compared annualised CH4 fluxes estimated by interpolation with those estimated using linear models and found that the former tended to be higher than the latter. We consider the implications of these results for the calculation of the radiative forcing effect of ombrotrophic peatlands.

AB This paper presents the results of the size of settlement in two stratigraphic sections and changes in morphology in four soil profiles between 1974 and 2012 in Polesie Lubelskie. The bed of peatlands classified as a low type, built reed peat with an mean depth of 3 m Sosnowica and 0.64 m Uhnin. The size of organic soil settlement measured surveying, is in the range of 9 cm to 33 cm, while mineral soils from 0 to 4 cm. The average size of settlement bog in Sosnowica was 24 cm in a period of 38 years, giving a reduction of 0.6 cm . year(-1), or peat weight loss of 11.5% of total resources. The situation is even worse in the case of peatland in Uhnin, where mineralization and fire peat bog area resulted in a decrease of 36%. Peat mass loss, due to fire, there was 53% of total resources, which corresponds to the reduction of 0.35 cm . year(-1). In period 50 years after dehydration is dominated by peat-muck soil a complex medium dry. The values of the correlation coefficient and the error rate indicates the inapplicability of empirical formulas for determining the size of the settlement.

AB Many north-hemispherical mires seemingly untouched by drainage and cultivation are influenced by a diffuse sum of man-made environmental changes, such as atmospherical nitrogen deposition that mask general patterns in species richness and functional group responses along resource gradients. To obtain insights into natural diversity-environment relationships, we studied the vegetation and the peat chemistry of pristine bog ecosystems in southern Patagonia along a west-east transect across the Andes. The studied bog ecosystems covered a floristic gradient from hyperoceanic blanket bogs dominated by cushion building vascular plants via a transitional mixed type to Sphagnum-dominated raised bogs east of the mountain range. To test the influence of resource availability on diversity patterns, species richness and functional groups were related to environmental variables by calculating general regression models and generalized additive models. Species richness showed strong linear correlations to peat chemical features and the general regression model resulted in three major environmental variables (water level, total nitrogen, NH(4)Cl soluble calcium), altogether explaining 76% of variance. Functional group response illustrated a clear separation along environmental gradients. Mosses dominated at the low end of a nitrogen gradient, whereas cushion plants had their optimum at intermediate levels, and graminoids dominated at high nitrogen contents. Further shifts were related to NH(4)Cl soluble calcium and water level. The models documented partly non-linear relationships between functional group response and trophical peat properties. Within the three bog types, the calculated models differed remarkably illustrating the scale-dependency of the explanatory factors. Our findings confirmed several general patterns of species richness and functional shifts along resource gradients in a surprisingly clear way and underpin the significance of undisturbed peatlands as reference systems for testing of ecological theory and for conservation and ecological restoration in landscapes with strong human impact.

AB Wet N deposition comprises oxidised (nitrate) and reduced (ammonium) N forms in proportions that vary spatially with source and topography. Field evidence of long-term N form effects on semi-natural ecosystems and how these are modified by phosphorus and potassium availability are lacking. This study describes cover changes for some key peatland species and litter chemistry from Sphagnum capillifolium, Calluna and Eriophorum vaginatum, and peat in response to 9 years of N treatment. Ammonium and nitrate as NH4Cl or NaNO3 were provided to replicate plots in rainwater spray at +8 (low) or +56 (high) kg N ha(-1) year, with and without PK via an automated system coupled to site meteorological conditions. Reduced N caused greater N accumulation in all key species than oxidised N, especially at higher doses, but cover declined more, though not significantly so, with oxidised than reduced N at the high N dose. Overall the detrimental effects of high N on Sphagnum and Calluna cover were significant but small. By comparison PK inclusion with 56 kg N ha(-1) year as oxidised N, not reduced N, had devastating effects on cover, causing both S. capillifolium and Calluna to decrease 3-5-fold, facilitating invasion and expansion of nitrophiles, non-characteristic bog plants e.g. Epilobium angustifolium, Epilobium palustre, Juncus effusus, Digitalis purpurea and Dryopteris dilatata. N form appears to be significant for peatlands because of its effects on pH. The significance of changes in plant cover for peat chemistry and decomposition for biogeochemistry is discussed.

AB A mechanistic understanding of carbon (C) sequestration and methane (CH4) production is of great interest due to the importance of these processes for the global C budget. Here we demonstrate experimentally, by means of column experiments, that burial of water saturated, anoxic bog peat leads to inactivation of anaerobic respiration and methanogenesis. This effect can be related to the slowness of diffusive transport of solutes and evolving energetic constraints on anaerobic respiration. Burial lowered decomposition constants in homogenized peat sand mixtures from about 10(-5) to 10(-7) yr(-1), which is considerably slower than previously assumed, and methanogenesis slowed down in a similar manner. The latter effect could be related to acetoclastic methanogenesis approaching a minimum energy quantum of -25 kJ mol(-1) (CH4). Given the robustness of hydraulic properties that locate the oxic-anoxic boundary near the peatland surface and constrain solute transport deeper into the peat, this effect has likely been critical for building the peatland C store and will continue supporting long-term C sequestration in northern peatlands even under moderately changing climatic conditions.

TI An Assessment of Plant Species Differences on Cellulose Oxygen Isotopes

AB Peat cores are valuable archives of past environmental change because they accumulate plant organic matter over millennia. While studies have primarily focused on physical, ecological, and some biogeochemical proxies, cores from peatlands have increasingly been used to interpret hydroclimatic change using stable isotope analyses of cellulose preserved in plant remains. Previous studies indicate that the stable oxygen isotope compositions (delta O-18) preserved in alpha cellulose extracted from specific plant macrofossils reflect the delta O-18 values of past peatland water and thereby provide information on long-term changes in hydrology in response to climate. Oxygen isotope analyses of peat cellulose (delta O-18(cellulose)) have been successfully developed from peat cores that accumulate the same species for millennia. However, to fully exploit the potential of this proxy in species-diverse fens, studies are needed that account for the isotopic variations caused by changes in dominant species composition. This study assesses variation in delta O-18 values among peatland plant species and how they relate to environmental waters in two fens informally named Horse Trail and Goldfin, located on the leeward (dry) and windward (wet) side, respectively, of the climatic gradient across the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. Environmental water delta O-18 values at both fens reflect unmodified delta O-18 values of mean annual precipitation, although at Goldfin standing pools were slightly influenced by evaporation. Modern plant [mosses and Carex spp. (sedges)] delta O-18(cellulose) values indicate that all Carex spp. are higher (similar to 2.5%) than those of mosses, likely driven by their vascular structure and ecophysiological difference from non-vascular mosses. Moss delta O-18(cellulose) values within each peatland are similar among the species, and differences appear related to evaporation effects on environmental waters within hummocks and hollows. The plant taxa-environmental water delta O-18 differences are applied to the previously determined Horse Trail Fen untreated bulk delta O-18 record. Results include significant changes to inferred millennial-to-centennial scale hydroclimatic trends where dominant taxa shift from moss to Carex spp., indicating that modern calibration datasets are necessary for interpreting stable isotopes from fens, containing a mix of vascular and nonvascular plants. Accounting for isotopic offsets through macrofossil analysis and modern plant-water isotope measurements opens new opportunities for hydroclimatic reconstructions from fen peatlands.

AB 1. The long-term carbon accumulation rate in a forested peatland in north-east Ontario was examined in relation to gas production and factors which control carbon transport.
   2 Plots of cumulative total mass and cumulative carbon mass against calibrated radio-carbon age estimates when applied to an existing model of peat accumulation, suggest that only very slow decay is occurring within the catotelm.
   3 Gas samples collected from depth shows that both carbon dioxide and methane are present. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon analysis yields age estimates of both gases which are between 500 and 2000 years younger than conventional age estimates on adjacent peat. It is suggested that this is due to the downward transport of younger carbon, probably as part of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in pore waters.
   4 High tritium content of peat pore water at depth indicates the presence of water recharged during the last 40 years and therefore supports this hypothesis. Hydrological data from piezometers confirms the existence of hydraulic gradients for vertical water movement and shows that the direction of flow varies seasonally.
   5 The results indicate that the internal carbon dynamics of peatlands are more complex than has previously been thought and that hydrology may be an important factor in the supply of source carbon for anaerobic decay.

AB The Carex flava aggregate belongs to one of the most taxonomically difficult groups of sedges which colonize diverse habitats, from organic to sandy, from acidic to alkaline, usually humid and moist. The study included 129 vegetation plots and ten soil variables (organic matter, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, carbonates, carbon, nitrogen, pH, and the ratio between organic carbon and nitrogen). The main aim was to determine the relationships between the various plant communities C. flava agg. occur in and their soil properties. With the aid of the two-way indicator species analysis and cluster analysis, we delimited nine vegetation types from the Scheuchzerio palustris-Caricetea fuscae, Littorelletea uniflorae, Molinio-Arrhenatheretea and Alnetea glutinosae classes differing in their response to soil properties. The CCA revealed pH, N, K, C, CaCO3, P and Ca to be statistically significant, and to account for 11.55% of the total variance in species composition. The largest differences, both in terms of species composition and in soil conditions, were revealed between communities with C. lepidocarpa and C. demissa. Carex lepidocarpa occurred in calcareous and extremely rich fens (Caricion davallianae) whereas C. demissa was found to occur in poor and moderately rich fens (Sphagno-Caricion canescentis, Caricion canescenti-nigrae). Carex flava grew mostly in calcareous, rich fens and wet grasslands (Caricion davallianae, Calthion palustris). Carex viridula was found in both calcareous, extremely and moderately rich fens and wet grasslands, and in nutrient-poor habitats such as dunes and sandy lake shores. The ecological niche of C. viridula is very wide and this species showed no affinity to any specific syntaxon.

AB The vegetation within an ombrotrophic mire expanse in SE Norway is studied in detail. Percentage cover of 45 species in 436 sample plots (16 x 16 cm), dispersed on 26 transects, are recorded. In addition, species abundance in 6976 subplots (4 x 4 cm) are recorded. 14 variables are recorded for each of the sample plots, while only distance to the water-table is estimated for the subplots. Spatial co-ordinates are supplied for all sample- and subplots. DCA ordination of a data-set consisting of 412 sample plots reveals two ecologically interpretable vegetational gradients: the hummock-hollow gradient (DCA I), and a gradient associated with the peat-production of the bottom layer (DCA 2). Passive DCA of subplots is used to get an impression of within sample plot heterogeneity, and shows that the fine-scale compositional turnover may be considerable. Partitioning of the variation in species abundance data is done by use of (partial) CCA. The fraction of unexplained variation is rather large for all the tested data-sets, but within the total variation explained, both distance to the water-table and spatial structure explain large parts.

AB This study examined factors controlling the vegetation in Kushiro mire, northern Japan, especially in the alder and reed communities. The alder community was classified into four types that were arranged by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) as follows: Carex lasiocarpa type, Carex augustinowiczii type, Persicaria type, and Spiraea type. The four types exhibited differences in size (tree height) and in the ratio of sprouting stems. Although plants growing on the forest floor primarily determined the species composition of the community, shading by alder crowns had no marked effect on the community gradient. Therefore, hydrochemical variables could control the growth and occurrence of both the floor plants and alder tree size. The differences between reed community and the alder community sites were characterized as heavily eutrophic by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Overall, the chemical variables pH and P2O5 and the hydrochemical variables maximum and range of water level were positively correlated with the CCA axis, and effectively explained the community gradient in relation to alder growth. These variables could be controlled by the inflow of neutral and turbid water from river floods or run-off, which would increase pH by replacing the acidic mire water, ash content, and P2O5 by conveying suspended inorganic particles that adsorb phosphorus.

AB [1] Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes in a palsa mire characterized by dry (palsa) and wet surfaces in a subarctic zone in Finland were measured using a static chamber technique during two climatically different years, 1998 and 1999. Each of the 24 collars was individually studied for water table level, peat temperature, pH, vegetation, frost depth, CO2 exchange and CH4 fluxes. The annual gaseous carbon balance varied from -36.9 g C m(-2) to -138.6 g C m(-2) (uptake) on wet surfaces. During both years, palsa surfaces with shrub vegetation were sinks for carbon, whereas palsa surfaces with sparse vegetation lost carbon to the atmosphere. In 1999, a wet year, a lower NEE resulted mainly from a decrease in photosynthesis. The annual emissions of CH4 ranged from 1.0 g CH4-C m(-2) in the palsa to 24.7 g CH4-C m(-2) at the palsa margin. On wet surfaces, photosynthesis, respiration and CH4 fluxes were tightly linked. Annual NEE and CH4 fluxes were close to the values reported for boreal peatlands (fens).

AB Over the millennia, peatlands have sequestered and stored carbon in the form of peat, that today accounts for around 30% of the global soil organic carbon. The peat has formed and accumulated due to the slow decomposition rate of organic matter in waterlogged, anaerobic conditions. The particularly close interdependence of the carbon and water cycles in peatland ecosystems signal the importance of understanding the water cycle to the functioning of peatlands.
   With this aim, the water and energy cycle of an alpine catchment in Italy, which includes a peatland, was studied using the process-based hydrological model GEOtop and a set of in situ measurements over 4 years (2012-2015). This is a challenging modelling exercise that has not been tried before with GEOtop. The catchment is heterogenous with land covers of peatland, grassland, scree and bare rock in a mountainous area. The GEOtop model was able to replicate the energy and water fluxes measured by an eddy covariance tower located in the peatland as well as the volumetric water content and soil temperature of the peatland accurately over the four years. This study shows that a process-based hydrological model can be used to study the water and energy dynamics of a peatland in a mountainous area.

AB Peatlands are one of the world's most important (xosystems, storing approximately 30 % of all terrestrial soil carbon as peat. Rotifers living in interstitial water within Sphagnum mats and in pitchers of Sanrwenia purpurea are capable of regenerating large amounts of nitrogen (NO3, NH4) and phosphorus (PO4). However, ecological research on rotifers living in bog interstitial waters has been neglected to date. We hypothesized that spatial variability of rotifer abundance and their nutrient contribution is uniform within bogs (i.e., at a local scale), and shows seasonal and geographic variability (i.e., at regional scales), and that rotifers contribute significantly to the nutrient budget of peatlands. To test these hypotheses, we assessed and quantified the role of rotifers in nutrient cycling (as nitrogen and phosphorus regeneration) in bog ecosystems at local, regional, and global scales. We present data on the spatial distribution and abundance of rotifers in bogs, and their effect on nutrient regeneration patterns during the growing season. We estimate that nutrient regeneration by rotifers may account for the regeneration of approximately 3.2-9.7% in Europe and 4.6-6.7% in North America, and be a major source of inorganic phosphorus. We estimate that, through nutrient regeneration, rotifers worldwide may provide 0.12 million tons of N and 0.17 million tons of P to bogs every year.

AB This study uses an integrated modeling framework that couples the dynamics of hydrology, soil thermal regime, and ecosystem carbon and nitrogen to quantify the long-term peat carbon accumulation in Alaska during the Holocene. Modeled hydrology, soil thermal regime, carbon pools and fluxes, and methane emissions are evaluated using observation data at several peatland sites in Minnesota, Alaska, and Canada. The model is then applied for a 10,000 year (15 ka to 5 ka; 1 ka = 1000 cal years before present) simulation at four peatland sites. We find that model simulations match the observed carbon accumulation rates at fen sites during the Holocene (R-2 = 0.88, 0.87, 0.38, and -0.05 using comparisons in 500 year bins). The simulated (2.04 m) and observed peat depths (on average 1.98 m) were also compared well (R-2 = 0.91). The early Holocene carbon accumulation rates, especially during the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) (35.9 g Cm-2 yr(-1)), are estimated up to 6 times higher than the rest of the Holocene (6.5 g Cm-2 yr(-1)). Our analysis suggests that high summer temperature and the lengthened growing season resulted from the elevated insolation seasonality, along with wetter-than-before conditions might be major factors causing the rapid carbon accumulation in Alaska during the HTM. Our sensitivity tests indicate that, apart from climate, initial water table depth and vegetation canopy are major drivers to the estimated peat carbon accumulation. When the modeling framework is evaluated for various peatland types in the Arctic, it can quantify peatland carbon accumulation at regional scales.

AB Undisturbed peatlands represent long-term net sinks of carbon; however, peat extraction converts these systems into large and persistent sources of greenhouse gases. Although rewetting and restoration following peat extraction have taken place over the last several decades, very few studies have investigated the longer term impact of this restoration on peatland carbon balance. We determined the annual carbon balance of a former horticulturally-extracted peatland restored 10 yr prior to the study and compared these values to the carbon balance measured at neighboring unrestored and natural sites. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured using the chamber technique biweekly during the growing season from May to October 2010 and three times over the winter period. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export was measured from remnant ditches in the unrestored and restored sites. During the growing season the restored site had greater uptake of CO2 than the natural site when photon flux density was greater than 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), while the unrestored site remained a source of CO2. Ecosystem respiration was similar between natural and restored sites, which were both significantly lower than the unrestored site. Methane flux remained low at the restored site except from open water pools, created as part of restoration, and remnant ditches. Export of DOC during the growing season was 5.0 and 28.8 gm(-2) from the restored and unrestored sites, respectively. Due to dry conditions during the study year all sites acted as net carbon sources with annual balance of the natural, restored and unrestored sites of 250.7, 148.0 and 546.6 gCm(-2), respectively. Although hydrological conditions and vegetation community at the restored site remained intermediate between natural and unrestored conditions, peatland restoration resulted in a large reduction in annual carbon loss from the system resulting in a carbon balance more similar to a natural peatland.

AB The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) constitute a globally significant carbon pool; the paleoecological record provides an opportunity to investigate long-term drivers of change in carbon accumulation and related changes in vegetation. We present a Holocene record from the Victor Fen site (VM-3-3) in Ontario's HBL to reconstruct vegetation history, quantify rates of carbon accumulation, and determine the role of paleoclimatic drivers. Pollen analysis indicates initiation of peat accumulation over a mineral substrate, accompanied by relatively rapid rates of carbon accumulation, following emergence from the Tyrrell Sea similar to 6900 yrs BP. The earliest vegetation assemblage consisted of a tidal marsh, quickly succeeding to a Typha marsh, then a poor fen dominated by Sphagnum and Cyperaceae by 6400 yrs BE Rapid rates of isostatic uplift at the time likely contributed to these changes. Once established, this fen community persisted without major vegetation change until the most recent century, when the abundance of shrub and Cyperaceae pollen increased, suggesting increasingly minerotrophic conditions. Average rate of long-term carbon accumulation (LORCA) for the whole record (mean = 22.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) is similar to other northern peatlands, and higher than the Holocene average for an adjacent bog. Increased precipitation after similar to 2400 yrs BP may have contributed to the higher LORCA reconstructed for the late Holocene, but the increased precipitation did not coincide with any apparent changes in vegetation as inferred from pollen assemblages.

AB Eutrophication is a major threat for several species-rich habitat types e.g. fens and meadows in riparian discharge areas throughout Europe, but few data are available to support the supposition that nutrient-contaminated groundwater from agricultural land is the direct cause for the continued decline of these formerly widespread habitat types. In the present study we investigated the role of nitrogen for the distribution of groundwater-dependent vegetation types in discharge areas in Denmark. Specifically we hypothesised (1) that the nitrogen availability in riparian discharge areas is linked to agricultural intensity in the topographic catchment and (2) that the spatial distribution of vegetation in riparian areas is influenced by nitrogen in the groundwater e.g. high productive reed beds dominate in areas with high levels of groundwater nitrogen, whereas species rich fens occur in areas with lower levels of groundwater nitrogen reflecting that incoming nutrients influence the productivity within the areas. We find evidence that the percentage of agriculture in the topographic catchment directly influenced the amount of nitrate in the discharging groundwater in the study areas and that groundwater nitrogen is closely coupled to the distribution of groundwater-dependent vegetation. Meadow and reed bed vegetation being highly productive were associated with higher levels of nitrate in the groundwater compared to low productive rich fen vegetation. From these findings we recommend that protected groundwater-dependent vegetation is mapped in groundwater discharge areas and that only those without presence of protected habitats are considered in rewetting plans to mitigate nutrient loss from agricultural production.

AB Designation of the Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) is ordered by the 'Habitat Directive' for the protection of plants and animals (except birds) and their habitats. The Navad-patak mire which was previously known for its Oxycocco-Sphagnatea associations is situated in the Bereg-plain near to Csaroda, which is in the center of a SAC area. In spite of the surrounding arables it contains many protected and rare plant species and plant associations. To describe the vegetation we made coenological records with Braun-Blanquet method using by permanent and temporary sampling plots and used Simon's nature conservation ranks. Regarding to the arables the rate of weeds and disturbance tolerant native species were high, but the number of adventive species were low. Emerged floating fens are the main importance of the mire in the middle of the peaty bed, where Sphagnum species may reappear. Our research showed, that these valuable habitats have more importance in the agricultural zone and attracts attention to environmental friendly farm management.

AB We studied methanogen activity-measured by in vitro methane production potential and by detection of the messenger RNA (mRNA) of a functional gene-in two boreal fens under high and deep water table (WT) level conditions resulting from a rainy growing season and a dry growing season. The depth of the highest CH4-producing layers differed between the years. In the wet year, the highest CH4 production rate was around 20 cm below the mean WT. In the dry year, the highest rates were measured close to the peat surface, well above the mean WT. The distribution of activity in the peat profiles of the two fens appeared to be site specific. Under deep-WT conditions, CH4 production potential was generally lower than that under high-WT conditions. Detection of the mRNA of the methanogen-specific mcrA gene indicated in situ methanogenesis in both water-saturated peat (below the WT) and unsaturated peat (above the WT). Analyses of DNA-derived and mRNA-derived methanogen community structures showed greater similarity between those two in water-saturated peat than in unsaturated peat. This suggested that favorable conditions promoted the activity of most members in methanogen communities, but unfavorable conditions showed differences between distinct community members in adaptation to adverse conditions.

AB Despite the importance of peatlands in the global carbon cycle, no widely applicable ecosystem model exists for peatlands. Simulations of three montane fens in Colorado. USA were conducted to test the capabilities of the CENTURY ecosystem model to simulate 1) long-term carbon accumulation and 2) short-term changes in carbon accumulation due to hydrologic changes. The CENTURY model was calibrated to simulate long-term carbon accumulation in two fens for up to 10.000 years by adjusting three variables that represent anaerobic soil conditions. CENTURY was unable to simulate long-term carbon accumulation in a third fen using settings for the two calibrated fens, However. CENTURY correctly simulated total carbon storage by adjusting two of the three anaerobic variables. A sensitivity analysis revealed that carbon accumulation in CENTURY is highly sensitive to anaerobic soil conditions. CENTURY predicted that half of the fen peat is composed of structural root material. The majority of the remaining peat was composed of recalcitrant slow and passive soil organic matter. Precipitation levels were altered to determine if CENTURY could predict the change in carbon accumulation rates due to periodic drier conditions. The simulated drying scenario predicted an average carbon loss of 70 g C m(-2) yr (1) during the 100-year simulation. The loss of carbon occurred despite plant production increasing from an average of 249 g C m (2) yr (1) to 391 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Slightly more than 90% of the carbon lost was from the structural root pool and slow organic matter pool, while there was no carbon loss or a slight net carbon gain in the passive organic matter pool and above-ground structural and metabolic pools. Despite several shortcomings, our results indicate that an ecosystem model, such as CENTURY, can be useful for simulating carbon dynamics in peatlands.

AB Following ecosystem-scale restoration of a post-harvested bog in Eastern Canada, a long term monitoring program was set up. Peat, water and plant chemistry data were collected during 7 years in a restored peatland, an adjoining post-harvested non-restored peatland, and in a neighboring natural peatland to determine the potential of chemistry data for evaluating of restoration success over time. We used a multivariate Principal Response Curves (PRC) approach to study the temporal evolution of peat, water, and plant tissue chemistry. Nitrogen, iron, and sodium were the most responsive elements to restoration in the peat. Water chemistry was still different between natural and restored sections 7 years after restoration, but the difference was not constant over the growing season. The analyses of plant tissue chemistry provided useful information related to fundamental processes (nutrient retention/leaching, plant nutrition). Among other, it highlighted P deficiencies in the non-restored section, and nutrient replenishment in the restored plant tissues. P levels appear to be a good indicator of restoration success and should be used routinely in monitoring studies. Since the three plants species tested in this study displayed different responses to restoration, we also recommend targeting key species or functional groups for monitoring.

AB Northern peatlands contain an estimated 1/3 of the world's soil carbon pool. This large carbon pool is of concern due to its uncertain future in a changing climate. Blanket bogs are peatlands that occur in temperate maritime regions where precipitation is much greater than evapotranspiration. We describe five years (1 October 2002 to 30 September 2007) of eddy-covariance (EC) carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements in an Atlantic blanket bog in Ireland. The measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was partitioned into its components of ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross ecosystem production (GEP). The inter-annual variation of the CO2 fluxes was investigated using correlation coefficient analyses with measured hydro-meteorological parameters. The annual NEE was negative for all five years (thus the peatland was a sink of CO2), ranging between -16.5 +/- 5.1 and -96.5 +/- 23.2 g C-CO2 m(-2) (average of -54.9 +/- 15.6 g C-CO2 m(-2)). During the study period, NEE was negative for the same five months in each year (May-September). NEE showed the highest CO2 uptake (due to the highest GEP) in the summer with intermediate rather than extreme meteorological conditions, thus with low vapour pressure deficit, intermediate soil water content, air temperature and light radiation, which might be partly explained by the role of the bryophyte community. Under climate change predictions of higher temperature, the inter-annual variation analysis suggests that ER might increase in winter. Furthermore, the predicted lower precipitation and higher temperature in the summer are expected to lead to lower GEP. The resulting increase in NEE (thus lower CO2 uptake) will be partly compensated by a higher GEP in warmer winters and in dryer autumns. Moreover, the CO2 uptake will benefit by a longer growing season, while wetter conditions will likely lower the ecosystem respiration in the spring. The length of the growing season was found to be driven by warmer winter and September soil temperatures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The potential impact of an increase in methane emissions from natural wetlands on climate change models could be very large. We report a profound increase in methane emissions from cores of mire peat and vegetation as a direct result of increasing the CO2 concentration from 355 to 550 mu mol mol(-1) (a 60% increase). Increased CH4 fluxes were observed throughout the four month period of study. Seasonal variation in CH4 flux, consistent with that seen in the field, was observed under both ambient and elevated CO2. Under ambient CO2 methane fluxes rose from 0.02 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in May to 0.11 mu mol m(-2) s(-3) in July before declining again in August. Under elevated CO2, methane fluxes were at least 100% greater throughout the experiment, rising from 0.05 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in May to a peak of 0.27 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in July. The stimulation of CH4 emissions was accompanied by a 100% increase in rates of photosynthesis from 4.6 (+/- 0.3) under ambient CO2 to 9.3 (+/- 0.7) mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Root and shoot biomass were unaffected.

AB Treatment peatlands are water purification systems located on existing mires. They are commonly used to treat different types of waters, ranging from municipal wastewaters to mine effluent. This study evaluated the capacity of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based thermal infrared (TIR) imaging, color infrared imaging, and stable water isotopes as a combined method for monitoring the functioning of a treatment peatland purifying mine process effluent water under boreal conditions in northern Finland. The results showed that TIR was an efficient tool for pinpointing cold groundwater seepage points in the peatland area that were not otherwise visible. Color infrared imaging was used to define Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as an indicator of plant health in the treatment area. A NDVI map of the area, measured on a day representing the main growing season (summer, +12 degrees C day temperature), revealed areas with stressed coniferous trees. This was probably due to excess water in these areas, resulting from successful spread of the process effluent water to the treatment peatland. Stable water isotopes were able to spatially differentiate the treated process effluent water, surface waters, and groundwater in different parts of the treatment peatland. This first attempt at combining these methods in monitoring of treatment peatlands was promising, as the results obtained with different methods complemented each other. While they produce only a snapshot of prevailing conditions, all three methods, singly and in combination, could be valuable tools in treatment peatland management.

AB The aim of this study is to assess the impact of biotic and abiotic factors on peatland formation in the Central Sudetes (central Europe) during the late Holocene. The research methodology adopted allowed us to determine whether vegetation development and shallow peatland formation were affected by human activity. Knowledge of past changes might be useful in evaluating recent and future changes, and to avoid pitfalls in the present management of peatland ecosystems. A palaeoecological research study of four peatlands was conducted in the Stolowe Mountains (Central Sudetes, SW Poland). The results showed that these shallow peatlands originated in the middle to late Holocene (from 3301 BC to AD 1137). Palaeoecological records reflect continuous human impact on vegetation development and peat accumulation from the Middle Ages to the present (late Holocene). The strongest agrarian settler activity is observed in the High Middle Ages (AD 1200-1500). The human-induced or wildfires observed in the late Holocene were an integral component of peatland ecosystems in the Central Sudetes. Moreover, palaeoecological analysis (sphagnum spores decline) and radiocarbon dating (AD 1870) confirmed drainage of the study area in the 19th century, which greatly affected the vegetation communities.

   WETLANDS; ENGLAND; SYSTEMS; WALES; SOIL; RESTORATION
AB We studied mechanisms of vegetation change in fens subject to succession from open water to floating mats and finally herbaceous rich-fens. Earlier research showed that these systems are characterized by transient seed banks. Our main question was whether seedlings of later successional fen stages are already present in earlier stages, remaining subordinate in the vegetation until conditions become suitable for them. If, however, conditions during succession change in a way that only a limited set of species can survive as seedlings during each of the successional stages, no seedling bank will exist. The transient character of the seeds would then imply that seeds will not germinate and will subsequently die and that seeds that have germinated in the "wrong" stage will not become established. We hypothesized that: (1) germination and seedling survival of fen species are significantly better in the successional fen stage for which these species are characteristic, (2) as a consequence no seedling banks occur in these fens. In a field experiment, seeds of five characteristic fen species in the standing vegetation of three successional fen stages i.e. raft fen, quaking fen and rich fen were sown in each of these stages in a turf pond in the Tienhoven area, The Netherlands. Germination and seedling survival were measured over two growing seasons together with environmental variables. Germination was higher in the "own" stage for all species groups as was survival for quaking fen species and rich fen species. For both these stages, percentage of germination and survival of four out of five characteristic species were significantly higher in the "own" stage. Germination and survival can be considered stage-dependent and it was concluded that seedling banks do not exist in these fens. Site-specific environmental variables act as a sieve and differentiate on species presence already during early life history stages. We found clues that the environmental sieve acts at the level of nutrient availability, tolerance for high sulphide concentration and light climate. Because of the transient seed bank and absence of a seedling bank in these fen wetlands, successful establishment of species necessitates a continuous dispersal of characteristic species until the environmental conditions permit establishment. This also implies that species of the whole successional sere should be present within dispersal distance.

AB Rewetting by beaver is reported from many European peatlands and especially from Belarus, which harbours vast abandoned peat extraction sites and a large beaver population. We studied how vegetation and exchange rates of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) changed after beaver had rewetted an abandoned drained fen in Belarus. We selected three sites with different vegetation and water levels. One meadow site turned into a nutrient-poor lake that remained virtually free of living vascular plants, released CO2 and CH4, and was a moderate source of greenhouse gases (GHG). In another meadow site that became shallowly flooded, the died-off vegetation was quickly replaced by mire plant species and in the second year the site had already become a strong CO2 sink, a moderate CH4 source and, as a result, a strong carbon sink and a weak net GHG emitter. The third site was dominated by forbs that died after intermittent flooding and were only slowly and sparsely replaced by wetland species. This site was a strong source of CO2 and N2O. Beaver activity can restore a peatland's carbon sink and reduce GHG emissions. However, as for humaninduced rewetting, the outcome depends on starting conditions, position and constancy of the water level, and the time needed for establishment of peat forming vegetation.

AB We demonstrate the potential of using freely available satellite data from the Landsat ETM+ sensor for generating carbon balance estimates for lowland peatlands. We used a lowland ombrotrophic peatland in the UK as our test site representing a range of peatland conditions. A literature survey was undertaken to identify the simplest classification schema that could be used to distinguish ecohydrological classes for carbon sequestration on the peatland surface. These were defined as: active raised bog, Eriophorum-dominated bog, milled unvegetated peat and drained or degraded bog, with bracken and Carr woodland to define the bog edges. A maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) was used to map the spatial distribution of the six classes on the peatland surface. A Landsat ETM+ band-5 derived brightness-texture layer created using geostatistical methods greatly improved classification accuracies. The results showed the best accuracy of the MLC, when compared to finer scale methods, with Landsat ETM+ bands alone was 74%, which increased to 93% when including the brightness-texture layer. An estimate of carbon sequestration status of the site was performed that showed good agreement with the results of a finer-scale-based estimate. The coarse-scale map estimating -12000kg carbon and fine scale map estimating +23000kg carbon per annum. We conclude that with further development of our tool, if textural measures are used alongside optical data in MLC, it is possible to achieve good quality estimates of carbon balance status for peatland landscapes. This represents a potentially powerful operational toolkit for land managers and policy makers who require spatially distributed information on carbon storage and release for carbon pricing and effective land management.

AB Permafrost peatlands store one-third of the total carbon (C) in the atmosphere and are increasingly vulnerable to thaw as high-latitude temperatures warm. Large uncertainties remain about C dynamics following permafrost thaw in boreal peatlands. We used a chronosequence approach to measure C stocks in forested permafrost plateaus (forest) and thawed permafrost bogs, ranging in thaw age from young (< 10 years) to old (> 100 years) from two interior Alaska chronosequences. Permafrost originally aggraded simultaneously with peat accumulation (syngenetic permafrost) at both sites. We found that upon thaw, C loss of the forest peat C is equivalent to similar to 30% of the initial forest C stock and is directly proportional to the prethaw C stocks. Our model results indicate that permafrost thaw turned these peatlands into net C sources to the atmosphere for a decade following thaw, after which post-thaw bog peat accumulation returned sites to net C sinks. It can take multiple centuries to millennia for a site to recover its prethaw C stocks; the amount of time needed for them to regain their prethaw C stocks is governed by the amount of C that accumulated prior to thaw. Consequently, these findings show that older peatlands will take longer to recover prethaw C stocks, whereas younger peatlands will exceed prethaw stocks in a matter of centuries. We conclude that the loss of sporadic and discontinuous permafrost by 2100 could result in a loss of up to 24 Pg of deep C from permafrost peatlands.

AB The term fen has been variously used by peatland ecologists, ground-water hydrologists, and vegetation scientists. The common denominator among all types of fens is recognition of the importance of ground-water discharge, especially mineral-rich ground water, in determining fen hydrology, chemistry, and vegetation, in contrast to wetlands whose characteristics are determined primarily by precipitation or surface-water inputs. Thus, fens tend to occur where climate and hydrogeologic setting sustain flows to the plant-rooting zone of mineral-rich ground water. In the United States, these areas include the glaciated Midwest and Northeast, as well as portions of the Appalachian Mountains and mountainous West. Individually and collectively, fens are among the most floristically diverse of all wetland types, supporting a large number of rare and uncommon bryophytes and vascular plant species, as well as uncommon animals including mammals, reptiles, land snails, butterflies, skippers, and dragonflies. Several species listed under the federal Endangered Species Act inhabit or use fens. Fens also help maintain stream water quality through denitrification and phosphor-us sorption. Few estimates of loss and current extent exist, but where estimates are available, they indicate extensive loss, fragmentation, and degradation. Cultural eutrophication threatens the biological and functional integrity of remaining fens because, along with mineral-rich water, low availability of nitrogen and phosphorus controls many of their distinctive characteristics. Because they occur where ground water discharges to the surface, fens are isolated from neither ground water nor surface water. However, the majority of fens develop in headwater areas and could be defined as "isolated" for jurisdictional purposes because of their distance from navigable-in-fact waters. If so defined, the critical roles that fens play in maintaining biological diversity and stream water quality are at risk regarding federal jurisdiction over "isolated waters" because of the 2001 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the case of Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

AB In both predictive theoretical and empirical models for aquatic plant communities in running waters, the development and competition are many times explained in terms of nutrients. Minerals necessary for growth are generally not assumed to be limiting, although they influence the important pH-value. At the same time it is known that factors such as oxygen-concentration, solar energy, salinity, dimension of the system and soil characteristics (including river sediments) influence the development of the community, and should be considered in modelling. Effects of water quantity and water quality on macrophytes are reviewed. These conditions are caused by processes in the landscape, characterised by a set of nested variables which explain the distribution of macrophyte species and communities. Relevant variables are described and grouped on-three scales: regional, local and site conditions. Case studies with direct and indirect gradient analysis-are presented: Statistical tests (stepwise regression with forward selection) reveal that each species distribution is explained by a characteristic set of relevant variables, ranging from soil type and dimension of the system, to nutrient and salinity concentration.

AB Oil sands mining in Alberta has disturbed large areas of peatland, the dominant regional ecosystem type, and no formal strategies exist to reconstruct the landscape. Peatland reclamation is challenging, but approaches are now being tested to determine the feasibility of rebuilding these valuable ecosystems. To evaluate our design concept, a pilot reclamation fen and associated watershed was constructed in an oil sands mine near Fort McMurray, Alberta. We implemented a large-scale multifactorial field experiment to test the introduction of bryophytes and vascular plants by moss layer transfer (MLT), seeds, and nursery grown seedlings under wood-strand mulch and with a Typha latifolia removal treatment. Four years after planting, the MLT and Juncus balticus seedling treatment supported the highest bryophyte and vascular plant cover and species richness. Removal reduced T. latifolia cover but was not necessary in areas where seedlings or MLT were introduced as it may have been competitively excluded by the planted species. The most successful fen species to establish was Carex aquatilis that spread quickly but also reduced the cover and species richness of bryophytes and other vascular plants. Water level influenced species distributions, with near surface water tables supporting higher cover of T. latifolia and lower bryophyte and other vascular plant cover and species richness. Our research demonstrates that it is possible to establish and maintain fen bryophytes and vascular plants and limit T. latifolia invasion in a constructed fen. To prioritize fen plant species richness and bryophyte cover, future projects should design for lower water levels, select species tolerant of expected abiotic conditions, and introduce nurse plants such as J. balticus. This research is the first of its kind to evaluate a range of species introduction approaches and demonstrates that it is possible to establish fen plants in the post-mined landscape of Alberta.

AB In western North America, ombrotrophic bogs are known to occur as far south as coastal regions of British Columbia. A recent discovery of a peatland with a raised peat surface on the western Olympic Peninsula in Washington State (Crowberry Bog), USA, suggested that the distribution range of this ecosystem type extends further south along the coast. To confirm if the site was an ombrotrophic peatland, we analysed its topography, hydrologic regime, water chemistry and vegetation. LiDAR data indicated that the peatland is elevated nearly 3 m above the surrounding landscape. Water table variations in the plateau were strongly associated with seasonal and daily precipitation events, indicating ombrotrophy. The hydraulic gradient on the plateau is downward through most of the year, demonstrating that precipitation is percolating vertically into deeper peat layers. In the rand, the hydraulic gradients are horizontal over much of the year, indicating that the plateau is draining through the rand to the lagg. Calcium, magnesium and potassium occur in very low concentrations, and the only ions in higher concentration are sodium and chloride, suggesting inputs of precipitation influenced by Pacific Ocean sea spray. Distinct vegetation composition and structure are associated with the plateau, rand and lagg zones of the site. These multiple lines of evidence indicate that Crowberry Bog is an ombrotrophic peatland, the first of its type identified in the conterminous western USA and the most southerly occurrence of its type in western North America.

AB Nutrient exports from soils have important implications for long-term patterns of nutrient limitation on land and resource delivery to aquatic environments. While plant-soil systems are notably efficient at retaining limiting nutrients, spatial and temporal mismatches in resource supply and demand may create opportunities for hydrologic losses to occur. Spatial mismatches may be particularly important in peat-forming landscapes, where the development of a two-layer vertical structure can isolate plant communities on the surface from resource pools that accumulate at depth. Our objectives were to test this idea in northern Sweden, where nitrogen (N) limitation of terrestrial plants is widespread, and where peat-forming, mire ecosystems are dominant features of the landscape. We quantified vertical patterns of N chemistry in a minerogenic mire, estimated the seasonal and annual hydrologic export of organic and inorganic N from this system, and evaluated the broader influence of mire cover on N chemistry across a stream network. Relatively high concentrations of ammonium (up to 2 mg l(-1)) were observed in groundwater several meters below the peat surface, and N was routed to the outlet stream along deep, preferential flowpaths. Areal estimates of inorganic N export from the mire were several times greater than from an adjacent, forested catchment, with markedly higher loss rates during the growing season, when plant N demand is ostensibly greatest. At broader scales, mire cover was positively correlated with long-term concentrations of inorganic and organic N in streams across the drainage network. This study provides an example of how mire formation and peat accumulation can create broad-scale heterogeneity in nutrient supply and demand across boreal landscapes. This mismatch allows for hydrologic losses of reactive N that are independent of annual plant demand and potentially important to receiving lakes and streams.

AB Boreal peatlands are major sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to downstream aquatic ecosystems, where it influences carbon cycling and food web structure. Wildfire and permafrost thaw alter peatland vegetation and hydrology and may affect the quantity and chemical composition of exported DOC. We studied the influence of wildfire and thaw on microbial and photochemical lability of near-surface porewater DOC, assessed through 7 d incubations. We carried out these incubations in spring, summer, and fall but only found differences in spring when DOC biodegradability (% loss during dark incubations) increased with lower DOC aromaticity and C/N ratios. During spring, the most labile DOC was found in recently formed thermokarst bogs along collapsing peat plateau edges (25% loss), which was greater than in mature sections of thermokarst bogs (3%), and peat plateaus with intact permafrost (9%). Increased DOC lability following thaw was likely linked to high DOC production and turnover associated with productive hydrophilic Sphagnum mosses and sedges, rather than thawed permafrost peat. A wildfire (3 yr prior) reduced DOC biodegradability in both peat plateaus (4%) and rapidly collapsing peat plateau edges (14%). Biodegradability of DOC in summer and fall was low across all sites; 2% and 4%, respectively. Photodegradation was shown to potentially contribute significantly to downstream DOC degradation but did not vary across peatland sites. We show that disturbances such as permafrost thaw and wildfire have the potential to affect downstream carbon cycling, particularly as the largest influences were found in spring when peatlands are well connected to downstream aquatic ecosystems.

AB Calcareous fens are among the most threatened and declining ecosystems throughout Europe and act as refugia for many endangered species. Traditionally, calcareous fens were mown but many of them have been abandoned and invaded by Molinia. This has led to changes in species composition, heavy loss in species diversity and a decrease in bryophyte cover. Fen restoration is complicated by an effective nutrient uptake and utilization of Molinia. Experimental tests of the effects of litter removal and different mowing regimes on restoration success are needed together with studies that compare the responses of different taxonomical groups.
   We applied three different types of restoration measures (once- and twice-a-year mowing, litter removal) in a block experiment over 6 years to test the effects on species density and composition of vascular plants and bryophytes. We used repeated measures anova, RDA with the Monte Carlo test and principal response curves.
   Species density and composition of both taxonomic groups were significantly influenced by mowing, but not by pure litter removal. Contrary to bryophytes, vascular plant species composition was more strongly influenced by twice-a-year mowing than by annual mowing. Vascular plant species density sharply increased after 2 years in both annual and bi-annually mown plots, to a greater extent in the latter.
   Late-spring nutrient concentrations in Molinia varied inconsistently across the years, but showed a trend of lower K-concentrations in mown plots. The tissue N:P ratio indicated P-limitation.
   Using nine sub-plots within each experimental plot, we found that Bryum pseudotriquetrum was able to spread quickly over the mown plots, while some other typical fen bryophytes (Fissidens adianthoides, Palustriella commutata, Scorpidium cossonii) were unable to increase in frequency, perhaps due to a low generative reproduction and weak competitive ability.
   Synthesis and applications. Molinia-invaded fen vegetation can be restored through intensive mowing. We recommend twice-a-year mowing instead of traditional late annual mowing as an initial restoration measure. Since the effect of the standing Molinia crop in our long-abandoned fen turned out to be more detrimental to other plants than accumulated litter, we do not recommend any management that is based on litter removal rather than mowing.

AB Drained peatlands in temperate Europe are a globally important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This article outlines a methodology to assess emissions and emission reductions from peatland rewetting projects using vegetation as a proxy. Vegetation seems well qualified for indicating GHG fluxes from peat soils as it reflects long-term water level, affects GHG emissions via assimilate supply and aerenchyma and allows fine-scaled mapping. The methodology includes mapping of vegetation types characterised by the presence and absence of species groups indicative for specific water level classes. GHG flux values are assigned to the vegetation types following a standardized protocol and using published emission values from plots with similar vegetation and water level in regions with similar climate and flora. Carbon sequestration in trees is accounted for by estimating the annual sequestration in tree biomass from forest inventory data. The method follows the criteria of the Voluntary Carbon Standard and is illustrated using the example of two Belarusian peatlands.

AB Fens are underestimated carbon sinks. Knowledge about their role in the sequestration of CO2 in the past is limited. The research reported here focused on identifying long-term carbon accumulation rates (CARs) in a drained fen (Bagno Bruch) and a waterlogged fen (Bagno Mikoeska) in southern Poland. On the basis of Pb-210 and AMS C-14 dates and age-depth modeling, 7000- and 2000-year records of changes in bulk composition and carbon and sulfur content are presented and discussed. Strong human impact is detected, especially in Bagno Bruch. However, minor climatic signals linked to the Little Ice Age' and to the influence of wind-blown sands are also evident. The sand may have influenced the plant composition, peat accumulation rates (PARs), and CARs, in addition to the bulk composition at Bagno Mikoeska. The mean value of the CAR in the youngest peat layers spanning the last 200years is generally lower in two cores from Bagno Bruch (c. 85 and 86g/m(2)/yr) than in two cores from Bagno Mikoeska (c. 140 and 142g/m(2)/yr). The fens are characterized by higher CARs compared with boreal peatlands. The reproducibility of the CAR values is the most promising result, suggesting the low mobility of Pb-210 and the reliability of this method in assessing the chronology of fens.

AB Purpose The analysis of n-alkanes in palaeoenvironmental studies of peatlands is mainly limited to ombrogenous peatlands which are a rare feature in the environment. Using n-alkane and plant macrofossil analysis, we have tracked changes in the environment in the valley of a large Central European river. We tested the possibilities for applying such studies to low-moor bogs which are the most commonly occurring type of bog in the world. Materials and methods Representative peat samples were taken from two profiles in a peatland located in the Vistula Valley (southern Poland), and they were analysed for the occurrence and distribution of biomarkers. The distribution of n-alkanes was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The botanical composition of the samples was determined by analysis of plant macrofossil remains, and the degree of peat decomposition was also determined. Results and discussion Samples of low-moor peat were characterised by a prevalence of medium- and long-chain n-alkane homologues, which is typical for higher plants. The variable values of the CPI, CPI ((25-31)), and the C-23/C-25 ratio have provided information on the stages of formation of the Zapadz bog. The source of n-alkane differentiation is vegetation change related to palaeohydrological dynamics and palaeoenvironmental conditions within the peatland. Conclusions We have shown that analysis of n-alkanes can be successfully used in low-moor bogs as a complement to palaeobotanical and palaeozoological methods. The bringing together of these types of research enables changes in the ecosystems of large river valleys to be tracked.

AB Peatlands in northern permafrost regions store a significant proportion of global soil carbon. Recent warming is accelerating peatland permafrost thaw and thermokarst collapse, exposing previously frozen peat to microbial decomposition and potential mineralization into greenhouse gases. Here, we show from a site in the sporadic-discontinuous permafrost zone of western Canada that thermokarst collapse leads to neither large losses nor gains following thaw, as deep carbon losses are offset by surficial accumulation. We collected peat cores along two thaw chronosequences, from peat plateau, through young (30 years since thaw), intermediate (70 years), and mature (200 years) thermokarst bog locations. Macrofossil and C-14 analysis showed synchronicity of peatland development until recent thaw, with wetland initiation 8,500 cal yr BP followed by succession through peatland stages prior to permafrost aggradation 1,800 cal yr BP. Analysis and modeling of soil carbon stocks indicated 8.7 +/- 12.4 kg C m(-2) of carbon accumulated prior to thaw was lost in 200 years post-thaw. Despite these losses, there was no observed increase in peat humification as assessed by Fourier transform infrared and C:N ratios. Rapid peat accumulation post-thaw (9.8 +/- 1.6 kg C m(-2) over 200 years) offset deeper losses. Our approach constrains the net carbon balance to be between uptake of 27.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and loss of 106.6 g C m(-2) yr(-1) over 200 years post-thaw. While our approach cannot determine whether thermokarst bogs in the sporadic-discontinuous permafrost zone act as long-term carbon sinks or sources post-thaw, our study better constrains post-thaw C losses and gains.
   Plain Language Summary Northern peatlands store a third of the world's soil carbon, a store which has slowly accumulated over the last 10,000 years. A large amount of this soil carbon has become frozen in permafrost peatlands, but warming is causing these stores to thaw. Permafrost thaw in peatlands not only leads to potential decomposition of previously frozen peat but also leads to increased growth of mosses at the surface. Increased decomposition of previously frozen peat can release formerly trapped carbon into the atmosphere as greenhouse gases, thus accelerating ongoing climate warming, while increased moss growth would increase carbon storage. In this study, we investigated the long-term impact of thawing on peatland carbon storage. To do this, we measured the amount of previously frozen permafrost carbon that was lost following thaw and compared it to the amount that accumulated at the surface. We found no long-term net impact of permafrost thaw on carbon stores, as losses of previously frozen carbon were offset by carbon that accumulated at the surface following thaw. Our results rule out both large rapid losses and large gains of carbon following thaw in peatlands, which greatly help to constrain projections of carbon cycling at high latitudes in a warming world.

AB The vast undisturbed mires in western Siberia formed a significant sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide during the Holocene. However, the lack of spatially resolved simulation models hampers the quantification of Holocene carbon accumulation of the entire mire systems. Here we developed a three-dimensional dynamic model, based on a hydrological approach. We applied the model to a large mire complex in western Siberia to simulate its Holocene development and to quantify the long-term carbon accumulation rate (LORCA). Our model simulated a LORCA with a spatial variation of 10-85 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The average over the Holocene was 16.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Simulation scenarios for the 21st century show that the average LORCA dropped to 5.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1) because of oxidation and decomposition of peat following mire drainage after the 1950s. Even in the undrained parts of the mire complex the LORCA is lowered substantially because of the dropped water table and resulting decrease in peat growth. Our results show that carbon accumulation in western Siberian watershed mires will continue in the future. Thus these mires might remain a significant sink of carbon.

AB The developmental histories of a wetland and the surrounding upland vegetation in the southern boreal region of western Canada are traced through microfossil, macrofossil, physico-chemical and radiometric analyses of a 425 cm deep core consisting of sandy gyttja and peat. Microfossil analysis includes algal, fungal and zoological 'Types' which are illustrated and described, with notes on their occurrence as observed in several peat sequences of western boreal Canada. Local wetland development started in the central area of a 65 ha closed depression at c. 5000 BP, due to a rise in the groundwater table related to a gradual increase in effective precipitation in the region. Initial stages were characterised by Typha-dominated marsh communities that suggest marked seasonal fluctuations in local water levels. The accumulation of organic matter could not keep pace with the ever-rising groundwater table, and a shallow eutrophic pond with aquatic macrophytes developed locally. The body of open water was surrounded by marsh vegetation that was gradually being displaced towards the margins of the depression. At 4330 BP moist conditions became prevalent throughout the growing season. A brown-moss dominated treed rich fen replaced the shore marsh community and gradually began to encroach on the small pond. The basin completely terrestrialised at 3260 BP. Autogenic processes caused by peat accumulation resulted in a transition towards a Sphagnum-dominated treed poor fen. At 2790 BP a treed bog became established, firstly dominated by Sphagnum angustifolium and S. magellanicum indicating moist local conditions. After 1870 BP S. fuscum became dominant, indicating drier conditions locally. The upland vegetation just before local wetland formation was characterised by Picea in relatively wet depressions and by Populus in drier areas. Some grassland patches were present, most probably on the more southerly exposed slopes of the hills. Picea was locally displaced by wetland vegetation at c. 5000 BP, whereas deciduous forest and some grassland stands continued to dominate the surrounding hills. The coniferous taxa Pinus and Picea began to invade the uplands after 4330 BP, contemporaneously with the development of the local peatland. This marks the time at which the modern southern boreal ecosystem dominated by peatlands in lowlands apd mixed wood forest in uplands became established in the area.

AB Questions: Have the natural plant communities of two mined bogs experienced changes in composition and richness over a three-decade period, and are these changes associated with anthropogenic disturbances?
   Location: Bas-Saint-Laurent region, southeastern Quebec, Canada.
   Methods: We monitored three decades of floristic changes in two disturbed bogs by revisiting 57 plots in 1998, which were previously sampled in 1965 and 1966. Changes in species richness and composition were evaluated using Wilcoxon signed rank tests, principal component analysis and partial redundancy analyses (pRDA). We also used pRDA and an indicator species analysis to determine which species had undergone the greatest changes over time. Variation partitioning was used to evaluate the relative influence of human disturbance in compositional change.
   Results: The main changes in the vegetation of the two bogs were 1) a decrease of overall species diversity, 2) an increase in the percent cover of trees and of species tolerant of shade or drought, and 3) a decrease in the cover of heliophilous species. Picea mariana, Sphagnum fuscum and Pleurozium schreberi increased in percent cover while Chamaedaphne calyculata and Sphagnum rubellum decreased in percent cover. Variation partitioning suggested that human activities had a significant impact on vegetation composition.
   Conclusion: The results indicated that substantial changes occurred in the vegetation of the natural fragments of these severely disturbed bogs. Although human activities were partially responsible for the changes, our study suggested that the drying of the peat surface due to drought during the 1960s and 1980s may have contributed to the vegetation changes.

AB Forested peatlands are widespread in the boreal landscape, but their role as carbon (C) pools remains poorly documented. In this study, we investigated the long-term C sequestration function of boreal forested bogs in relation to fires in eastern Canada. Results show that the forested peatlands comprise substantial peat C mass reaching values similar to open peatlands. At the six studied peatland sites, the amount of C stored in peat (62-172 kg C m(-2)) exceeds substantially the aboveground tree biomass C (1.5-5.3 kg C m(-2)). The C locked up in live conifers on the peatlands corresponds only to a small fraction of the C stored in peat (1-6%). In comparison, the shallow organic layer (<= 30 cm) in the adjacent paludifying stands store 10.8 kg C m(-2) on average, which is about twice as much C as the live conifers. Long-term apparent C accumulation rates are relatively low in the studied forested bogs (mean: 15.9 g C m(-2) y(-1)), suggesting that these ecosystems have lower C sequestration potential than non-forested bogs over millennia. The charcoal data suggest that past local fires reduced C sequestration rates, but these peatlands burn much less frequently than upland forests and are thus more efficient long-term C stores. This study highlights the importance of boreal forested peatlands as C reservoirs and helps understanding how fires, logging and climate change can affect their C sequestration function. These findings have important implications for ecosystem management that aims at maximizing C sequestration at the landscape level to mitigate climate change.

AB Climatic and environmental changes can lead to shifts in the dominant vegetation communities present in northern peatland ecosystems, including from Sphagnum-to vascular-dominated systems. Such shifts in vegetation result in changes to the chemical quality of carbon substrates for soil microbial decomposers, with leaves and roots deposited in the peat surface and subsurface that potentially decompose faster. This study characterized the bacterial and fungal communities present along a nutrient gradient ranging from rich to poor fen peatlands and assessed the metabolic potential of these communities to mineralize a variety of organic matter substrates of varying chemical complexity using substrate-induced respiration (SIR) assays. Distinct microbial communities existed between rich, intermediate and poor fens, but SIR in each of the three sites exhibited the same pattern of carbon mineralization, providing support for the concept of functional redundancy, at least under standardized in vitro conditions. Preferential mineralization of simple organic substrates in the rich fen and complex compounds in the poor fen was not observed. Similarly, no preference was given to "native" organic matter extracts derived from each fen, with microbial communities opting for the most bioavailable substrate. This study suggests that soil bacteria and fungi might be able to respond relatively rapidly to shifts in vegetation communities and subsequent changes in the quality of carbon substrate additions to peatlands associated with environmental and climatic change.

AB Peatlands are a dominant land feature in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) of the Western Boreal Plain (WBP), comprising > 50% of the total land area, many of which are moderate-rich fens. The carbon stocks of moderate-rich fens in the WBP are susceptible to degradation through anthropogenic- and climate-related factors, yet, few studies have aimed to understand their hydrologic function. This study, located in a meltwater channel belt characterized by relatively thin outwash sand and gravel (similar to 6 m) underlying the peat, provides the first hydrological assessment of a moderate-rich fen in the AOSR. The lithology, hydrological function and groundwater geochemistry all point to the dominance of a local flow system supplying groundwater to the fen areas, evidenced by a thick (similar to 16 m) and shallow (similar to 7 m below ground surface) aquitard underlying the outwash, restricting hydrological connectivity between the fen and underlying regional aquifers. Vertical hydraulic gradients between the peat and underlying outwash aquifer, and horizontal hydraulic gradients between the fen and upland varied in response to both short-term and seasonal precipitation trends. Groundwater discharge to the fen was enhanced during wet periods characterized by high rainfall. Conversely, flow reversals (groundwater recharge; fen to underlying aquifer and upland), and subsequently, enhanced fen water table drawdown persisted during extended dry periods. This local groundwater flow-system influences recharge/discharge patterns at Poplar Fen, with hydraulic head in the underlying outwash aquifer highly susceptible to fluctuations in the presence and absence of precipitation-driven recharge from adjacent uplands. Moderate-rich fens similar to that studied here will likely become more susceptible to drying in the future due to a changing climate, leading to enhanced water table drawdown, peat oxidation and subsequent decomposition, vulnerability to wildfire, and seral succession to a more ombrogenous peatland system.

AB The morphology and chemical characteristics of mineral soils underlying modern peaty (histic) and shallow peat soils (or histosols) are analyzed in pedoecological conditions of Estonia. The underlying shallow peat mantle gley soils have been formed on different geological origin (glaciolacustrine, glacial, glaciofluvial, marine) parent materials. The peat mantle overlying gley soils has accumulated in the process of landscape paludification during the post glacial period. Using the Estonian Soil Classification (ESC), the peat layer thickness of peaty soils is 10-30 cm and of shallow peat soils, 30-100 cm. The studied peaty soils may be characterized as polygenetic soils. Depending on parent material properties (calcareousness, acidity, texture) and feeding water the peaty soils are divided into two types specified by ESC as peaty gley soils and peaty podzols, and by WRB as Histic Gleysols and Histic Podzols. The mineral soils underlying peat soils may be defined as paleosols. The development of such soils has proceeded according to the chronosequence: gley soils or protosols -> peaty soils -> fen soils -> transitional bog soils -> bog soils, whereas mineral paleosols may be found under fen, transitional bog and bog soils. The peat soils studied in this research work, classified by ESC as drained shallow transitional (mesotrophic) bog soils and by WRB as Drainic Dystric Ombric Hemic Fibric Histosols, are located on the edges of bog areas and are fed mostly by mesotrophic surface seepage water. In comparative analysis of three soil groups (peaty gley soils, peaty podzols and shallow peat soils) (i) their location on the landscape, the geological origin of their parent materials and morphology of the mineral layers are characterized; (ii) the vertical distribution of organic carbon and total nitrogen contents, and different characteristics of soil acidity are analyzed, and (iii) their catenal position or associated soils are characterized. In the case of peaty soils, the three types of mineral soil profiles (eluvial, eluvio-accumulative and accumulative) which underlie the peat cover were elucidated. Under thicker peat layers, i.e. under shallow peat soils, mostly humus accumulative profiles were found. In all analyzed sites, in the course of progressive paludification (among this peatification) the peaty soils have been formed from gley soils. The formation of the peaty soil stage was followed by the fen soil stage. Depending on the feeding water, some of these soils developed in the direction of bog soils, with an intermediary transitional bog stage. Artificial drainage is of great importance in the development of peat cover, which influences first the decomposition of top layer peat. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Peatlands are globally important ecosystems but many are degraded and some are eroding. However, some degraded peatlands are undergoing apparently spontaneous recovery, with switches from erosion to renewed carbon accumulation-a type of ecological regime shift.
   2. We used a palaeoecological approach to investigate and help understand such a switch in a blanket peatland in North Wales, UK.
   3. Our data show: (a) a rapid accumulation of new peat after the switch from the eroding state, with between 5.2 and 10.6 kg/m(2)carbon accumulating since the beginning of the recovery which occurred between the late 1800s and early to mid-1900s CE, with an average carbon accumulation rate in the new peat between 46 and 121 g C m(-2) year(-1); (b) three main successional pathways in peat-forming vegetation and (c) hydrological changes with an increase to moderately high water-tables after the switch that promoted new carbon accumulation as well as protecting vulnerable old carbon. External factors, including changes in climate and industrial activity, can only partially explain our results. Following previous studies, we suggest that internal ecosystem processes offer a substantial part of the explanation and interpret the switch to renewed carbon accumulation as a bifurcation-type tipping point involving changes in the physical form of the eroded landscape.
   4. Synthesis. Our long-term ecological data reveal a switch from a degraded peatland with active erosion and loss of carbon to a revegetated, wetter peatland accumulating carbon. The switch can be interpreted as a bifurcation tipping point. We suggest that external factors such as climate and pollution levels are important for setting suitable boundary conditions for peatland recovery, but internal mechanisms can explain the change in peatland state. Our study is the first of its kind to apply tipping point theory to the internal mechanisms linked to peat erosion and recovery and may help improve understanding of the trajectories of other peatlands in a changing climate.

AB Astelia pumila (G.Forst.) Gaudich. (Asteliaceae, Asparagales) is a major element of West Patagonian cushion peat bog vegetation. With the aim to identify appropriate chloroplast markers for the use in a phylogeographic study, the complete chloroplast genomes of five A. pumila accessions from almost the entire geographical range of the species were assembled and screened for variable positions. The chloroplast genome sequence was obtained via a mapping approach, using Eustrephus latifolius (Asparagaceae) as a reference. The chloroplast genome of A. pumila varies in length from 158,215 bp to 158,221 bp, containing a large single copy region of 85,981-85,983 bp, a small single copy region of 18,182-18,186 bp and two inverted repeats of 27,026 bp. Genome annotation predicted a total of 113 genes, including 30 tRNA and four rRNA genes. Sequence comparisons revealed a very low degree of intraspecific genetic variability, as only 37 variable sites (18 indels, 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms, one 3-bp mutation)-most of them autapomorphies-were found among the five assembled chloroplast genomes. A Maximum Likelihood analysis, based on whole chloroplast genome sequences of several Asparagales accessions representing six of the currently recognized 14 families (sensu APG IV), confirmed the phylogenetic position of A. pumila. The chloroplast genome of A. pumila is the first to be reported for a member of the astelioid clade (14 genera with c. 215 species), a basally branching group within Asparagales.

   DYNAMICS
AB Throughout the Holocene, northern peatlands have both accumulated carbon and emitted methane. Their impact on climate radiative forcing has been the net of cooling (persistent CO(2) uptake) and warming (persistent CH(4) emission). We evaluated this by developing very simple Holocene peatland carbon flux trajectories, and using these as inputs to a simple atmospheric perturbation model. Flux trajectories are based on estimates of contemporary CH(4) flux (15-50 Tg CH(4) yr(-1)), total accumulated peat C (250-450 Pg C), and peatland initiation dates. The contemporary perturbations to the atmosphere due to northern peatlands are an increase of similar to 100 ppbv CH(4) and a decrease of similar to 35 ppmv CO(2). The net radiative forcing impact northern peatlands is currently about -0.2 to -0.5 W m(-2) (a cooling). It is likely that peatlands initially caused a net warming of up to +0.1 W m(-2), but have been causing an increasing net cooling for the past 8000-11 000 years. A series of sensitivity simulations indicate that the current radiative forcing impact is determined primarily by the magnitude of the contemporary methane flux and the magnitude of the total C accumulated as peat, and that radiative forcing dynamics during the Holocene depended on flux trajectory, but the overall pattern was similar in all cases.

AB Methane emissions and element mobility in wetlands are controlled by soil moisture and redox conditions. We manipulated soil moisture by weekly drying and irrigation of mesocosms of peat from a bog and iron and sulfur rich fen. Water table changed more strongly in the decomposed fen peat (similar to 11 cm) than in the fibric bog peat (similar to 5 cm), where impacts on redox processes were larger due to larger change in air filled porosity. Methanogenesis was partly decoupled from acetogenesis and acetate accumulated up to 5.6 mmol L-1 in the fen peat after sulfate was depleted. Irrigation and drying led to rapid redox-cycles with sulfate, hydrogen sulfide, nitrate, and methane being produced and consumed on the scale of days, contributing substantially to the total electron flow and suggesting short-term resilience of the microbial community to intermittent aeration. Anaerobic CO2 production was partly balanced by methanogenesis (0-34%), acetate fermentation (0-86%), and sulfate reduction (1-30%) in the bog peat In the fen peat unknown electron acceptors and aerenchymatic oxygen influx apparently drove respiration. The results suggest that regular rainfall and subsequent drying may lead to local oxidation-reduction cycles that substantially influence electron flow in electron acceptor poor wetlands.

AB Peatlands drained for agriculture are sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Resulting emissions may depend on land-use, often as grassland or cropland, but few studies have directly compared the effects of land-uses. Here, we measured annual emissions of CO2, N2O and methane (CH4) from five sites in a temperate bog, representing an undrained natural bog (NB) site, and four drained sites used as permanent grassland (PG) and croplands with rotations of oat-potato, oat-spring barley and potato-spring barley (PO:SB) in the study year. Gas fluxes were measured at 1-2 week intervals using static chambers, and auxiliary data were obtained, such as temperature, depth of water table, ratio-vegetation index, pH and soil mineral N. Annual CO2 emissions were derived from empirical modelling, whereas CH4 and N2O emissions were linearly interpolated between measurement dates by bootstrapping. Soil respiration was lower at the NB site (1.8 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1)) than at the drained sites where emissions were in the range of 5.0-8.8 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1). The N2O emission was negligible at NB (0.3 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)), low at three of the drained sites (1.5-3.7 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)), but high at PO:SB (37.7 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)). The CH4 emission was high at NB (172 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1)), but negligible at the drained sites (-1.5 to 1.5 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1)). The soil respiration at the drained sites indicated that peat losses were rather similar among the different cropping systems and depended mostly on drainage status, although soil respiration and peat mineralization may not scale directly. The pattern of N2O emissions suggested an increased risk of N2O emission from potato cultivation before and after the period of potato growth, likely due to microbial availability of NO3- outside the growing season. For initiatives aiming at reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural peat soils, this means that, e.g., conversion from cropland to permanent grassland should preferably be accompanied by measures of rewetting, whereas for potato cropping, N availability outside the growing season should be minimized.

AB Rising concentrations of tropospheric ozone are having detrimental impacts on the growth of crop and forest species and some studies have reported inhibition of the allocation of carbon below ground. The effects of ozone on peatland ecosystems have received relatively little attention, despite their importance within the global carbon cycle. During this study, cores from a Welsh minerotrophic fen and ombrotrophic bog were exposed to four ambient/elevated ozone concentration regimes representing current and predicted 2050 profiles. A large and significant reduction in the concentration of porewater dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was recorded in the fen cores exposed to the elevated ozone concentrations (up to -55%), with a concurrent shift to a higher molecular weight of the remaining soil carbon. No effects of ozone on DOC concentrations or characteristics were recorded for the bog cores. The data suggest higher ozone sensitivity of plants growing in the fen-type peatland, that the impacts on the vegetation may affect soil carbon characteristics through a reduction in root exudates and that there may have been a shift in the source of substrate DOC for microbial consumption from vegetation exudates to native soil carbon. There may also have been a direct effect of ozone molecules reacting with soil organic matter after being transported into the soil through the aerenchyma tissue of the overlying vegetation. These qualitative changes in the soil carbon in response to elevated ozone may have important implications for carbon cycling in peatland ecosystems, and therefore climate change.

AB Temperate fens are rapidly losing their specialized species. This applies even to seemingly untouched fens, in which the moss layer in particular is undergoing rapid succession. We analysed historical and recent vegetation-plot data from fens in the agricultural landscape on the Bohemian Massif (Czech Republic) to test the hypotheses that (i) more acidicolous and/or competitively stronger species that benefit from increased nutrient availability regionally increase in frequency and in percentage cover, and (ii) these competitively stronger bryophytes have become more tolerant of high pH because of the increased nutrient supply. We worked with two datasets: a precise dataset (the most similar pairs of samples from the same fens) and a large dataset (all of the historical and recent samples from the area studied). We found that calcicolous brown mosses specialized for growing in fens have recently been retreating to places with the highest pH, being replaced by more nutrient-demanding species such as Calliergonella cuspidata, Sphagnum palustre, S. teres and Straminergon stramineum in most of rich fens. Sphagnum fallax and S. flexuosum spread only in poor fens. At the level of individual species, the intensity of change in species abundance (cover-weighted frequency change) correlated significantly with the median potassium concentration in the biomass of species based on a large set of recent data. We conclude that nature conservancy authorities should monitor changes in the species composition of the moss layer as this may signal the initial phase of nutrient enrichment of seemingly intact fens in agricultural landscapes.

AB We used satellite remote sensing data; fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (fPAR) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in combination with tower eddy covariance and meteorological measurements to characterise the Light Use Efficiency parameter (epsilon) variability and the maximum epsilon(epsilon(max)) for two contrasting Canadian peatlands. Eightday MODIS fPAR data were acquired for the Mer Bleue (2000 to 2003) and Western Peatland (2004). Flux tower eddy covariance and meteorological measurements were integrated to the same eight-day time stamps as the MODIS fPAR data. A light use efficiency model: GPP = epsilon x APAR (where GPP is Gross Primary Productivity and APAR is absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) was used to calculate epsilon. The epsilon(max) value for each year (2000 to 2003) at the Mer Bleue bog ranged from 0.58 g C MJ(-1) to 0.78 g C MJ(-1) and was 0.91 g C MJ(-1) in 2004, for the Western Peatland. The average growing season epsilon for the Mer Bleue bog for the four year period was 0.35 g C MJ(-1) and for the Western Peatland in 2004 was 0.57 g C MJ(-1). The average snow free period for the Mer Bleue bog over the four years was 0.27 g C MJ(-1) and for the Western Peatland in 2004 was 0.39 g C MJ(-1). Using the light use efficiency method we calculated the epsilon(max) and the annual variability in epsilon for two Canadian peatlands. We determined that temperature was a growth-limiting factor at both sites Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD) however was not. MODIS fPAR is a useful tool for the characterization of epsilon at flux tower sites.

AB There is a limited understanding of the hydrological and microclimatic processes from drained, harvested, or restored peatlands, and by extension the nature of the carbon balance is uncertain. However, understanding the symbiotic processes governing water and gas exchange is essential to the development of appropriate management plans for peatland restoration. In this paper, we highlight and contrast the suite of processes governing the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon on natural, harvested, and restored peatlands. Evapotranspiration from harvested sites is important throughout the spring and summer, and is not greatly different from the adjacent natural bog. On cutover peatlands, strong capillary water movement compensates for the lack of vascular plants, which on the natural bog become increasingly important as the capillary water movement within drying Sphagnum decreases. Methane emissions from cutover bogs are an order of magnitude lower than in natural sites, however, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are approximately three times greater. Peatland restoration enhances CO2 sequestration, although restoration (at least in the short term) does not restore the net carbon sink function to that in natural bogs. A conceptual model highlighting these changes in the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon from a natural bog through drainage, harvesting, abandonment, and restoration is presented.

AB While some aspects of peatlands are well studied, understanding of the hydrology and geomorphology of the associated surface drainage networks is quite limited. This paper attempts to describe some of the basic attributes of stream channels in peatlands, and asks whether the form and the mechanisms behind development represent a significant departure from self-fort-ning alluvial streams. We use three approaches to better understand these poorly studied systems: an examination of the geomorphology of Allequash Creek, Wisconsin; a survey of aerial photographs of similar peatland-stream complexes in northern Wisconsin; and a review of the existing literature on peat-influenced and wetland channels. Distinct features of Allequash Creek and other Wisconsin streams in peatlands include absence of mineral substrates, low width/depth ratio, presence of lateral pool-like structures along the channel margin, long straight reaches, and acute-angle bends. Further, the lateral location of the thalweg was apparently independent of planform or cross-sectional form, and no-flow zones often occurred along both edges of channel cross-sections. Collectively, these features represent a distinct departure from characteristic forms of alluvial channels. Deep peat samples from Allequash Creek and aerial photographs from other sites indicate that these streams represent remnant lake systems whose basins filled with peat. Thus, we suggest that the processes responsible for channel form in these low energy peatland systems are largely governed by groundwater hydrology and the biology of peat accumulation and decomposition. In this manner, biological forces not just physical drivers such as channel discharge and sediment supply - are central to the understanding of stream geomorphology in peatlands.

AB We characterized the major ion chemistry of over 800 lakes on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, from a probability sample of 59 lakes (August 1988). There were two groups: alkalinity < 300 mueq/L (78% of the lakes) and alkalinity > 700 mueq/L. Low-alkalinity lakes had significantly lower concentrations of base cations and silica and significantly higher average concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) than high-alkalinity lakes. Despite widespread acidic soils and bog vegetation, and resulting high DOC concentrations, none of the lakes sampled was acidic. Sulfate concentrations (approximately 3 mueq/L) were similar in the two groups, as were Cl- concentrations, which decreased with distance from the coast. High-alkalinity lakes were similar chemically to rivers and shallow aquifers in the region, suggesting that the high alkalinity is a product of the major weathering reactions in this terrain; the substantially different ratios of base cations in the two groups also indicate quantitative and qualitative weathering differences. Low-alkalinity lakes were at higher elevations than high-alkalinity lakes, presumably in groundwater recharge zones. Consequently, the chemical differences between the two lake groups appeared to be controlled by relatively small differences in local hydrologic setting, and possibly by differences in mineralogy along the groundwater flowpaths.

AB Drought is arguably the most important regulator of inter-annual variation in net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in peatlands. This study investigates effects of drought periods on NEE and its components, gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco), on the basis of eddy covariance measurements of land-atmosphere exchange of CO2 in 2006-2009 in a south Swedish nutrient-poor peatland. Two drought periods had dissimilar effects on the CO2 exchange. In 2006, there was a short but severe drought period in the middle of the growing season resulting in increased R-eco rates, but no detectable effect on GPP rates. In contrast, in 2008 the drought period began early in the growing season and lasted for a longer period of time, resulting in reduced GPP rates, suggesting that GPP is most sensitive to drought during leaf out and canopy development compared with the full canopy stage. Both in 2006 and in 2008 the peatland acted as an annual source of atmospheric CO2, while in 2007 and 2009, when there were no drought periods, the peatland constituted a CO2 sink. It was concluded that the timing, severity and duration of drought periods regulate the effects on peatland GPP, R-eco and NEE.

AB In northeastern Canada, at the ecotonal limit of the forest tundra and lichen woodland, a rise of the regional water table in the peatland systems was registered since Little Ice Age resulting in increasing pool compartment at the expense of terrestrial surfaces. We hypothesized that, with a mean water table closer to peat surface and higher pool density, these ecosystems would be great CH4 emitters. In summers 2009 and 2010, methane fluxes were measured in a patterned fen located in the northeastern portion of the La Grande river watershed to determine the contribution of the different microforms (lawns, hollows, hummocks, string, pools) to the annual CH4 budget. Mean seasonal CH4 fluxes from terrestrial microforms ranged between 12.9 and 49.4 mg m(-2) day(-1) in 2009 and 15.4 and 47.3 mg m(-2) day(-1) in 2010. Pool fluxes (which do not include ebullition fluxes) ranged between 102.6 and 197.6 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) in 2009 and 76.5 and 188.1 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) in 2010. Highest fluxes were measured in microforms with water table closer to peat surface but no significant relationship was observed between water table depth and CH4 fluxes. Spatially weighted CH4 budget demonstrates that, during the growing season, the studied peatland emitted 66 +/- A 31 in 2009 and 55 +/- A 26 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) in 2010, 79 % of which is accounted by pool fluxes. In a context where climate projections predict greater precipitations in northeastern Canada, these results indicate that this type of peatlands could contribute to modify the methane balance in the atmosphere.

AB Aims Global change is shown to significantly affect the C storage function of peatlands; however, a majority of previous research is focused on a single environmental stressor such as the increased temperature. As a result, little is known about the interactive effect of multiple environmental stressors on peatland C storage, especially in sedge-dominated fen peatlands. Methods We performed a full factorial experiment of increased temperature and elevated atmospheric CO(2)concentration on minerotrophic, sedge-dominated fen monoliths to experimentally examine the individual and interactive effects of simulated future climate conditions on peatland plant biomass, CO(2)exchange, and pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over one full growing season. Results Our study demonstrates that warming and elevated atmospheric CO(2)significantly increased aboveground and belowground biomass, respectively, as well as the gross ecosystem production (GEP), while the DOC concentrations and respired CO(2)from peatland soils only increased under warming Conclusions Our results suggest that global change will increase both plant production and microbial decomposition, but with altered plant biomass allocation between aboveground and belowground. Our study provides experimental evidence for shifts in ecosystem-level carbon dynamics under global change for a sedge-dominated peatland, and suggests that while carbon stores may weaken, the carbon sink will be maintained in these types of northern peatlands if hydrological conditions are largely maintained.

AB Long-term net ecosystem CO2 exchange measurements were conducted on a nutrient-rich fen in northern Finland using the eddy covariance method. During the three measurement years (2006-2008), the mean daytime CO2 flux in July was -0.40 Mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1), while in mid-winter (January-March) the mean efflux was 0.008 Mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Annual balances of -12, -123 and -216 g CO2 m(-2) a(-1) were observed in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. It is suggested that the low uptake in 2006 was related to the warm and dry conditions during the growing season and the consequent reduction in vegetation activity. When compared with two other fens in Finland, there was a clear correspondence between the nutrient status, mean pH value, maximum LAI and the mid-summer CO2 uptake. A similar pattern was not seen in the annual CO2 balance, which correlates more with the growing season length.

AB Climate change can alter peatland plant community composition by promoting the growth of vascular plants. How such vegetation change affects peatland carbon dynamics remains, however, unclear. In order to assess the effect of vegetation change on carbon uptake and release, we performed a vascular plant-removal experiment in two Sphagnum-dominated peatlands that represent contrasting stages of natural vegetation succession along a climatic gradient. Periodic measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange revealed that vascular plants play a crucial role in assuring the potential for net carbon uptake, particularly with a warmer climate. The presence of vascular plants, however, also increased ecosystem respiration, and by using the seasonal variation of respired CO2 radiocarbon (bomb-C-14) signature we demonstrate an enhanced heterotrophic decomposition of peat carbon due to rhizosphere priming. The observed rhizosphere priming of peat carbon decomposition was matched by more advanced humification of dissolved organic matter, which remained apparent beyond the plant growing season. Our results underline the relevance of rhizosphere priming in peatlands, especially when assessing the future carbon sink function of peatlands undergoing a shift in vegetation community composition in association with climate change.

AB Northern peatlands contain vast amounts of organic carbon. Large-scale datasets have documented spatial patterns of peatland initiation as well as vertical peat accumulation rates. However, the rate, pattern, and timing of lateral expansion across the northern landscape remain largely unknown. As peatland lateral extent is a key boundary condition constraining the dynamics of peatland systems, understanding this process is essential. Here we use ground penetrating radar (GPR) and peat core analysis to study the effect of local slope and topography on peatland development at a site in south-central Alaska. The study site is unique in that a thick tephra (volcanic ash) layer, visible in the GPR data, interrupted the peatland development for about one thousand years during the mid Holocene. In our analysis, this tephra layer serves as a re-initiation point for peatland development. By comparing the initial mineral basin vs. the post-tephra surfaces, the influence of topography and slope on peatland expansion rate and peat-carbon sequestration was analyzed. Our results show that (1) peatland surface slope becomes progressively shallower over the Holocene, (2) slope affects peatland lateral expansion nonlinearly, (3) the relationship between lateral expansion rate and slope follows a power-law behavior, and (4) peatland expansion becomes slope-limited above a threshold (0.5 degrees). Furthermore, we propose a conceptual model linking slope to peatland lateral expansion where slope gradient and basin topography exert deterministic controls on peatland lateral expansion directly or through hydrology and vertical accumulation rates.

AB Natural mires and forested peatlands are known to be very significant sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to aquatic ecosystems. Peatland management operations (e.g., forestry operations, restoration of drained mires and peat mining) and extreme hydrological events may increase the DOC runoff. We hypothesized that an increase in phosphorus (P) leaching, together with near-neutral conditions in recipient lakes will accelerate decomposition of DOC that originates from acidic, nutrient-poor mire waters. The efficiency of DOC utilization was evaluated by measuring microbial respiration and bacterial production (BP) in short-term laboratory experiments with runoff waters from six boreal mire sites. Mere inorganic phosphorus (PO4-P) addition did not affect the rate of respiration or the proportion of decayed DOC. However, in the nutrient-poor bog waters, P addition slightly promoted BP and bacterial growth efficiency (BGE). In contrast, the elevation of pH alone, and the elevation of pH and PO4-P level together, caused a significant increase in respiration and in the proportion of decayed DOC, but did not affect net BP. Elevated pH alone, however, depressed BGE when compared to that under the combined elevation of pH and PO4-P. These results suggest that the increased P availability, e.g., after mire restoration, would slightly benefit bacterial net growth in P-limited waters. However, in near-neutral recipient lakes, the increased microbial decomposition of mire-originated DOC contributes more to carbon dioxide (CO2) supersaturation than potentially supporting detritus-based food chains.

AB We measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) for two years in a remnant New Zealand raised peat bog using the eddy covariance technique and estimated the component CO2 fluxes gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). Vegetation was dominated by vascular plants belonging to the southern hemisphere family Restionaceae, comprising an overstory of the erect Sporadanthus ferrugineus and a dense understory of Empodisma robustum. Annual NEE (GPP, ER) totals for the two years were -218.2 (1124.2, 906.0) gCm(-2) yr(-1) and -250.3 (1148.3, 897.8) gCm(-2) yr(-1), indicating substantially larger CO2 sink strength than has been reported for peatland ecosystems in the northern hemisphere. The bog was a net sink for CO2 in nine months each year, with small differences in autumn and wintertime NEE accounting for most of the difference in annual NEE totals. Summer daytime average NEE were similar to published values for northern hemisphere peatlands, despite differences in vegetation type and a comparatively deep water table. Fitted ecosystem light response and respiration model parameters were also within the ranges of values reported for peatlands elsewhere. The major distinction compared to northern peatlands was the year-round productivity of the evergreen vegetation cover in New Zealand, which largely offset respiration losses during the short, mild winter season.

AB This study explores the history of the development of Sphagnum communities in an ombrotrophic peatland - Bagno Kusowo - over the past 650years, based on high-resolution plant macrofossil and testate amoebae analysis. Our research provided information related to the length of peatland existence and the characteristics of its natural/pristine state before the most recent human impacts. Changes in the Sphagnum communities before human impact could have resulted from climate cooling during the Little Ice Age' (LIA). In this cold and unstable hydrological period, among vascular plants, Eriophorum vaginatum and Baeothryon caespitosum dominated in the peatland vegetation. Peat-forming Sphagnum communities survived the drainage conducted during the 20th century at the Bagno Kusowo bog. We provide three important messages through this study: (1) testate amoebae reflect similar hydrological trends in two peat cores despite considerable microhabitat variability, (2) average long-term water level 10cm below the surface should be a target for active bog conservation and (3) sites like Bagno Kusowo are extremely important to preserve the remains of pristine biodiversity (including genetic diversity of plants and protists) that was completely removed from most of the raised bogs in Europe due to human activities, for example, drainage.

AB We investigated the role of plant interactions in producing the zonation of strong competitors, i.e. clonal dominants, and weak competitors, i.e. interstitials. In addition, it was tested whether the effect of plant interactions on species richness depends on the position on the flooding gradient. During one growing season vegetation canopy was removed at a low elevation, dominated by Phragmites australis and at a high one, dominated by tall forbs, mainly Urtica dioica. The seed bank was examined and in half of the plots seeds of clonal dominants from high elevations and interstitials from low elevations were sown to ensure that seeds of both groups were present at both zones.
   At both elevations, removal of vegetation canopy resulted in a strong increase of interstitial species, but interstitials from low elevations failed to establish in cleared plots at the tall forb zone. This could not be attributed to the absence of seeds and we concluded that conditions unfavourable for germination, rather than plant interactions determine the zonation of interstitials from the P. australis zone. Many seedlings of tall forb dominants emerged in cleared plots at the low elevation. However, number of seedlings rapidly declined during the first year. Hence, abiotic conditions, most probably flooding, prevented seedling establishment of tall forb dominants at zones dominated by P. australis.
   Canopy removal increased species richness at the low elevation in the first year only, whereas at the higher elevation species richness in cleared plots remained higher throughout the second year when the canopy was no longer removed. We therefore concluded that species richness of freshwater shorelines is controlled by abiotic factors in the frequently flooded zone and by plant interactions at higher elevations.

AB Warming conditions across Canada's subarctic and arctic regions are causing permafrost landforms to thaw, resulting in rapid land cover change, including conversion of peat plateaus to wetland and thermokarst. These changes have important implications for northern ecosystems, including shifting controls on carbon uptake and release functions, as well as altering evapotranspiration (ET) rates, which form feedbacks with climatic change. Four landforms (peat plateau, sedge lawn, channel fen, and a thermokarst shoreline collapse scar) in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, northern Manitoba, were instrumented for weekly chamber measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor flux over a summer season (May to September 2014). Relative to other landforms, thermokarst CO2 exchange was characterized by high respiration rates early in the season, which decreased and were offset later in the season by CO2 uptake driven by sedge productivity. For all landforms, ET peaked post-snowmelt during rapid active layer thaw, and decreased throughout the growing season, controlled primarily by atmospheric vapor deficits. This work shows distinct differences in CO2 exchange and ET between intact and thawing permafrost features. While representative of small-scale processes in a single study region over one growing season, the results presented in this study have important implications for our understanding of ecohydrological and biogeochemical functioning of subarctic landscapes under future climates.

AB Two peat cores from the southern boreal forest in south-central Manitoba and central Saskatchewan (Canada) were analyzed for microfossils, macrofossils, and physicochemical properties. Regional vegetation and local peatland development at these sites show the influence of warm and dry climatic conditions during the middle Holocene. Pollen assemblages at the base of the Manitoba site indicate the presence of grassland-parkland vegetation in the area prior to 4230 BP. At the Saskatchewan site, boreal forest was present throughout the development of the peatland from before 5020 BP to present. Both the Manitoba and Saskatchewan records suggest a more open-deciduous character of the regional vegetation cover during the middle Holocene in the southernmost part of the expanding boreal forest, in comparison with the modern southern mixed-wood boreal forest. The presence of a Typha latifolia-dominated marsh phase in the initial stages of development of both peatlands is indicative of marked water level fluctuations, likely due to frequent and severe periods of drought. Highest accumulation rates (1.24 mm peat/a, and 69 g carbon/(m2.a)) occur in the forested fen phase (4290-3710 BP) of the Saskatchewan site. Low accumulation rates (0.24 mm peat/a, and 12 g carbon/(m2.a)) in the bog phase (3710-960 BP) at this site are probably due to interruption of peat deposition or even surficial erosion of the deposits. Accumulation rates at the Manitoba site (4230-0 BP) are less variable, ranging from 0.30 to 0.82 mm peat/a and from 19 to 28 g carbon/(m2.a). Changes in accumulation rates at the Saskatchewan and Manitoba sites are not synchronous in spite of similarities in general development, indicating that, in addition to climate, local factors have played roles in the developmental histories of these peatlands.

AB (1) The high-altitude (4,500+ m) Andean mountain range of north-western Bolivia contains many peatlands. Despite heavy grazing pressure and potential damage from climate change, little is known about these peatlands. Our objective was to quantify carbon pools, basal ages and long-term peat accumulation rates in peatlands in two areas of the arid puna ecoregion of Bolivia: near the village of Manasaya in the Sajama National Park (Cordillera Occidentale), and in the Tuni Condoriri National Park (Cordillera Real).
   (2) We cored to 5 m depth in the Manasaya peatland, whose age at 5 m was ca. 3,675 yr. BP with a LARCA of 47 g m(-2) yr(-1). However, probing indicated that the maximum depth was 7-10 m with a total estimated (by extrapolation) carbon stock of 1,040 Mg ha(-1). The Tuni peat body was 5.5 m thick and initiated ca. 2,560 cal. yr. BP. The peatland carbon stock was 572 Mg ha(-1) with a long-term rate of carbon accumulation (LARCA) of 37 g m(-2) yr(-1).
   (3) Despite the dry environment of the Bolivian puna, the region contains numerous peatlands with high carbon stocks and rapid carbon accumulation rates. These peatlands are heavily used for llama and alpaca grazing.

AB Question: What is the contribution of a rise in groundwater level to vegetation restoration of degraded peat meadows compared to abandonment only?
   Location: Abandoned peat meadows in the central part of The Netherlands.
   Methods: Comparison of species composition and species abundance of vegetation and seed banks of reference and rewetted peat meadows, using plant trait and seed bank analysis.
   Results: Vegetation of rewetted meadows shared on average only 27% of their species with the reference meadow, while this was 50% on average for species in the seed bank. Rewetted meadows had a lower total number of species and a lower number of wet grassland and fen species present in the vegetation, but had higher species richness per m(2), although evenness was not affected. Rewetting increased the dominance of species of fertile and near neutral habitats, but did not result in an increase of species of wet or waterlogged habitats. Rewetted meadows were dominated by species relying mainly on vegetative reproduction and species with a low average seed longevity compared to the reference meadow.
   Conclusion: Rewetting was not effective as a restoration measure to increase plant species diversity or the number of wet grassland and fen species in the vegetation. If no additional restoration management is applied, the seed bank will be depleted of seeds of species of wet grassland or fen habitats, further reducing the chances of successful vegetation restoration.

AB Continuous measurements of ecosystem scale evapotranspiration (ET) were obtained using the eddy covariance method over the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons (May-September) at three adjacent peatlands that have undergone long-term water table manipulation. The three (wet, dry and intermediate) sites represent peatlands along a hydrological gradient, with different average depths to water table (WTD) and different resulting vegetation and microform assemblages. The 2010 growing season was warmer and wetter than normal, while 2011 conditions were near normal. The difference in maximum daily ET values (95th percentiles) between sites were greater in 2010 (3.14 mm d(-1) -4.17 mm d(-1)) compared to 2011 (3.68 mm d(-1) -3.95 mm d(-1)), yielding cumulative growing season ET that followed the wet to dry gradient in both 2010 and 2011. Synoptic weather conditions (i.e. air temperature, vapour pressure deficit, and incoming solar radiation, etc.) could not explain differences in ET between sites due to their proximity to one another. Peat surface wetness was more spatially homogeneous at the wet site due to small average microtopographic variations (0.15 m) compared to the intermediate (0.30 m) and dry (0.41 m) sites. Although average Bowen ratios were less than one at all three sites, greater surface wetness and heating at the wettest site lead to differences in energy partitioning, with higher average Bowen ratios at the sites with a shallow average WTD. No significant relation between normalized ET and WTD was found at any of the sites that were consistent across both study years. In addition, the lack of a relation between ET and near-surface moisture suggests that the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and the boundary layer resistance created by the vascular canopy combined with low surface roughness limits evaporative losses from the peat surface. This study suggests that the low ET of a dry site compared to a wet site may be due to the impact of a long-term change in WTD on leaf area and the relative distribution of plant functional groups.

AB We present the results of a unique study of long-term succession in a former raised bog after intensive peat cutting. As probably one of the first restoration experiments the study site 'Gammelmose' (22 ha) in NE Zealand, Denmark, was in 1844 protected from any further human usage. Since then several surveys of water level, peat re-growth and vegetation change were carried out in 18 permanent plots. The vegetation data from 1861, 1885, 1963, 1981 and 2005 were analysed with DCA and correlated with selected environmental variables. The peat layer increased in thickness by <1 m within the period 1859-2005, and the bog surface became slightly convex; the water level was at 10-20 cm belowground in 2005. The vegetation developed from an open wetland with a number of fen species over a phase with locally dominant Phragmites australis to a half-open birch-pine forest with abundant Sphagnum-mosses. The increasing frequency of woody species was reflected by lower Ellenberg indicator values for light and soil moisture. The first DCA axis was correlated with succession time and frequency of woody species, and negatively with the two Ellenberg indicator values. The second DCA axis was also correlated with time and woody species, but negatively with Ellenberg values of soil nutrients and soil reaction. In the period 1861-2005, several fen species with relatively high demands for light and nutrients disappeared (e.g. Peucedanum palustre, Stellaria palustris, Viola palustris), while most bog species continued (e.g. Andromeda polifolia; Vaccinium oxycoccos, V uliginosum), and new plant species mainly naturalised from gardens immigrated (e.g. Spiraea alba var. latifolia, Picea glauca, Prunus padus). In 2005, the vitality and growth of many trees in the bog looked reduced, and some of the taller individuals began to sink into the peat layer. Thus, in future the half-open bog forest may show some natural dynamics allowing survival of bog species in a mosaic of changing microhabitats.

AB During 2002-2009, we surveyed butterflies at 73 bogs, 20 adjacent lowland roadsides, and 5 nearby upland roadsides in northern Wisconsin and three bogs in central Wisconsin, with additional observations from 1986 to 2001. Especially in northern Wisconsin, bogs are relatively unaffected by humans, but naturally comprise < 1% of the landscape. Bog specialist species composition varied by bog type (muskeg, kettlehole, coastal peatland). Specialist abundance also varied significantly both among bog types and within type among sites. A number of bog specialists frequently occurred in numerous examples of bogs, including all three types. But virtually no specialist individuals occurred in nearby upland roadsides. Northern Wisconsin bogs had similar specialist species richness compared to large barrens and heaths in the same region. Specialist species comprised a small proportion (10%) of all butterfly species recorded in bogs, similar to proportions reported for specialists in tallgrass prairie and barrens. However, specialists accounted for nearly half the total individuals recorded in bogs, comparable to proportions of specialists found in less fragmented vegetation (barrens) and larger patches of favorably managed prairie, but far exceeding proportions observed in other highly fragmented prairie patches. A fundamental lesson may be that aiming to conserve typical ecosystems, even if native, and their average processes, leads to average (generalist) butterflies. Bogs have different vegetation types superimposed on each other, including bog, heath, forest, sedge meadow, and wet meadow associates in the same spots. Conservation management needs to avoid simplifying the vegetation to one layer, reducing specialist fauna. Long-term vegetative consistency, as in bogs, is advised for conservation management of specialist butterflies in other fragmented vegetations.

AB Degradation by drainage threatens biodiversity and globally important peatland ecosystem functions such as long-term carbon sequestration in peat. Restoration aims at safeguarding peatland values by recovering natural hydrology. Long-term effects of drainage and subsequent restoration, especially related to within-site variation of water table level and pore water chemistry, are poorly known. We studied hydrological variation at 38 boreal Sphagnum peatland sites (pristine, drained and restored) in Finland. The average water table level was significantly lower at Drained than Pristine sites especially near the ditches. We also observed large pore water chemical differences between Drained and Pristine sites, such as higher DOC concentration at the sites drained several decades earlier. Furthermore, there were large differences in water chemistry between the samples collected from ditches and from the peat strips between the ditches. For example, the ditch water had apparently higher minerogenic influence, while DOC concentrations were highest in peat strips. The water table level was, on average, at the targeted level of Pristine sites at 5 years ago restored (Res 5) and 10 years ago restored (Res 10) sites. The Res 10 sites were more similar to the Pristine sites in water chemical composition than were the Drained sites. Water chemical differences between ditches and peat strips were smaller at the Res 5 and Res 10 than at Drained sites indicating, on average, successful decrease of drainage-induced within-site variation in water chemistry. Our results suggest more pronounced water table inclination towards the old ditches at Res 10 than at Res 5 sites. While this pattern may be an early warning sign for incomplete recovery of hydrology in long-term, we found no chemical evidence supporting this assumption yet. Our study suggests that restoration can result in significant recovery of peatland hydrology within 10 years, while some deviation from pristine hydrology is still typical. Restoration appears to have potential to reduce leaching of nutrients and DOC to downstream waters in the long term, but practitioners should be prepared for temporary increase of leaching of N and P for at least 5 years after restoration of boreal Sphagnum peatlands.

AB We investigated the microfungal assemblages in the decomposing tissues of dominant plant species in two peatlands in southern boreal Alberta, Canada, to determine if distinct patterns of succession of microfungi occurred throughout the first two years of decomposition. These plant species were Sphagnum fuscum from a bog and Carex aquatilis leaves and rhizomes and Salix planifolia leaves and roots from a riverine, sedge-dominated fen. Canonical correspondence analyses, a multivariate statistical analysis used infrequently in mycological research, revealed distinct patterns of fungal species succession in two of the five litters (S. fuscum and C. aquatilis leaves). Furthermore, our analyses showed that substantially different microfungal assemblages were associated with these litters within the first two years of decomposition. Litter quality variables, such as total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total carbon tissue nutrient concentrations, explained most of the succession patterns and differences in the microfungal assemblages of these five litters. Our data did not reveal the classical taxonomic zygomycete - ascomycete/fungi imperfecti - basidiomycete pattern of succession during organic matter decomposition. Similarly, a succession of functional groups of microfungi, i.e., cellulose-degraders preceding lignin-degraders, generally was not apparent. Instead, microfungi with broad spectra of enzymatic abilities co-existed over the first two years of decomposition in these peatland plant litters. These microfungi have a limited ability to decompose complex phenolic polymers, such as lignin, resulting in the accumulation of peat in these ecosystems. Some microfungal taxa were not affected by changes in litter quality, environmental variables, or surface water chemistry and were present at all stages of decomposition.

AB Riparian ecosystems can harbor great diversity and provide important ecological functions such as improving water quality. The impact of eutrophication on riparian ecosystems, however, is unclear. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to study the effects of nutrient loading on riparian ecosystems. We specifically asked whether the source of nutrients in the riparian zone affects the complex interactions that occur between surface water and adjacent wetlands. We also studied litter decomposition in the wetland component of the mesocosms, because litter accumulation in fens is assumed to control succession toward floating mats. Each mesocosm consisted of an upland component, referred to as the bank, and a water compartment. The bank and water compartments were planted with typical riparian zone and open water fen species prior to the addition of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in different combinations to either the bank or the surface water. Nutrient addition (mainly P) resulted in increased plant production and higher expansion rates of plants on the bank and in the water. There were also clear interactions in plant responses between the bank and water. Only eutrophic species increased shoot densities after fertilization. Nutrient addition further resulted in higher litter production, especially on the banks, and stimulated decomposition. Both the plant responses and the litter experiment indicated that eutrophication would accelerate succession to floating mats. Such floating fen mats are not likely to have the typical species-rich combination of desirable species; however, as our results suggest that they would be dominated by a few eutrophic species.

AB 1 Methane emissions from emergent plants in two peatlands were measured in plant enclosure experiments. During the summer growing season, methane emissions on a plant dry mass basis from Scheuchzeria palustris (130 +/- 14 mu mol g(-1) day(-1)) were higher than from other peatland plants, such as Chamaedaphne calyculata (20 +/- 3 mu mol g(-1) day(-1)) and Carex oligosperma (91 +/- 38 mu mol g(-1) day(-1)), but were lower than from Calla palustris (280 +/- 37 mu mol g(-1) day(-1)).
   2 The contribution to net methane efflux from S. palustris, the dominant emergent plant in one peatland, was 15.6 +/- 2.2 mmol m(-2) day(-1), based on the plant enclosure experiments and areal biomass measurements. These results were not significantly different from the difference between measurements of methane efflux using chambers enclosing clipped and unclipped plots (12.0-27.9 mmol m(-2) day(-1)).
   3 We determined that methane transport through S. palustris contributed between 64 and 90% of the net methane efflux from the peatland, while the other peatland without plants capable of rapid methane transport had significantly lower methane efflux. The higher annual efflux from peat with aerenchymatous plants appears to be due to several factors, including increased substrate production which enhances methane production, reduction in methane oxidation, as well as easier methane transport from the site of production.
   4 Plants capable of transporting methane regulated the methane pool in the saturated zone by depleting both dissolved methane in the pore-waters and the concentration of methane in gas bubbles trapped in the saturated peat.
   5 Our experiments indicate that methane transport through S. palustris is due to molecular diffusion, and is not influenced by pressurization or stomatal aperture.

AB Peatlands and forests cover large areas of the boreal biome and are critical for global climate regulation. They also regulate regional climate through heat and water vapour exchange with the atmosphere. Understanding how land-atmosphere interactions in peatlands differ from forests may therefore be crucial for modelling boreal climate system dynamics and for assessing climate benefits of peatland conservation and restoration. To assess the biophysical impacts of peatlands and forests on peak growing season air temperature and humidity, we analysed surface energy fluxes and albedo from 35 peatlands and 37 evergreen needleleaf forests-the dominant boreal forest type-and simulated air temperature and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) over hypothetical homogeneous peatland and forest landscapes. We ran an evapotranspiration model using land surface parameters derived from energy flux observations and coupled an analytical solution for the surface energy balance to an atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) model. We found that peatlands, compared to forests, are characterized by higher growing season albedo, lower aerodynamic conductance, and higher surface conductance for an equivalent VPD. This combination of peatland surface properties results in a similar to 20% decrease in afternoon ABL height, a cooling (from 1.7 to 2.5 degrees C) in afternoon air temperatures, and a decrease in afternoon VPD (from 0.4 to 0.7 kPa) for peatland landscapes compared to forest landscapes. These biophysical climate impacts of peatlands are most pronounced at lower latitudes (similar to 45 degrees N) and decrease toward the northern limit of the boreal biome (similar to 70 degrees N). Thus, boreal peatlands have the potential to mitigate the effect of regional climate warming during the growing season. The biophysical climate mitigation potential of peatlands needs to be accounted for when projecting the future climate of the boreal biome, when assessing the climate benefits of conserving pristine boreal peatlands, and when restoring peatlands that have experienced peatland drainage and mining.

AB In this review paper, we identify and address key uncertainties related to four local and global controls of Holocene northern peatland carbon stocks and fluxes. First, we provide up-to-date estimates of the current northern peatland area (3.2 M km(2)) and propose a novel approach to reconstruct changes in the northern peatland area over time (Section 2). Second, we review the key methods and models that have been used to quantify total carbon stocks and methane emissions over time at the hemispheric scale, and offer new research directions to improve these calculations (Section 3). Our main proposed improvement relates to allocating different carbon stock and emission values for each of the two dominant vegetation assemblages (sedge and brown moss-dominated vs. Sphagnum-dominated peat). Third, we discuss and quantify the importance of basin heterogeneity in estimating peat volume at the local scale (Section 4.1). We also highlight the importance of age model selection when reconstructing carbon accumulation rates from a peat core (Section 4.2). Lastly, we introduce the role of biogeomorphological agents such as beaver activity in controlling carbon dynamics (Section 5.1) and review the newest research related to permafrost thaw (Section 5.2) and peat fire (Section 5.3) under climate change. Overall, this review summarizes new information from a broad range of peat-carbon studies, provides novel analysis of hemispheric-scale paleo datasets, and proposes new insights on how to translate peat-core data into carbon fluxes. It also identifies critical data gaps and research priorities, and many ways to consider and address them. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands are one of the most important carbon cycle regulatory ecosystems, and are influenced by global climate change. However, studies of this kind of wetland are scarce in southern South America. In this study we performed a detailed analysis of recent accumulation rates of carbon (RERCA) in two types of Sphagnum peatland in Isla Grande de Chiloe (Chile) (42 degrees-43 degrees S and 75 degrees-73 degrees W). Monoliths of peat in continuous depths were analyzed and assigned ages using 210 Pb dating. The results showed a difference between the two types of peatland: the average rate for the anthropogenic peatland (107.34 +/- 113.9 g C m(-2) yr(1)) was superior to that of the natural peatland (78.33 +/- 77.1 g C(-2)yr(1)). The surface profiles (30 cm) clearly revealed the recent rate of carbon accumulation for the past 100 years in Sphagnum peatlands of Northern Patagonia. The rate for the natural peatland is within the range found for ombrotrophic peatlands in the Northern Hemisphere. However, the rate estimated for the anthropogenic peatland was significantly greater than those reported in other parts of the world. Our results provide evidence of the importance of these unique ecosystems in the carbon accumulation process.

AB Although methane (CH4) dynamics are known to differ at broad scales among peatland types and with climate, there is limited understanding of the variability associated with anaerobic carbon (C) cycling, and, the mechanisms that control that variability, among low pH, Sphagnum moss-dominated peatlands within a geographical region with similar climate. This is important because upscaling of CH4 emissions to regional and global scales often considers peatlands as a single, or at most two, ecosystem type(s). Here, we report the results from two studies exploring the controls of CH4 cycling in peatlands from the Upper Midwest (USA). Potential CH4 production and resultant CO2:CH4 ratios varied by several orders-of-magnitude among these soils. These differences were only partially explained by pH and fiber content (a measure of degree of decomposition in peat), suggesting other, more complicated controls may drive CH4 cycling in ombrotrophic peat soils. Based in part on the results from this survey, we more intensively examined CH4 dynamics in three bog-like, acidic, Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in northern Minnesota that differed in their degree of ombrotrophy. Net CH4 flux was lowest in the peatland with well-developed hummocks, and the isotopic composition of the CH4 along with methanotroph gene expression indicated a strong role for CH4 oxidation in controlling net CH4 flux. There were limited differences in porewater chemistry (CH4 and dissolved inorganic C concentrations) or microbial community composition among sites, and potential CH4 production was also similar among the sites. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that high variation in CH4 cycling in seemingly similar peatlands within a single geographical region is common. We suggest a one peatland represents all approach is inappropriate-even among Sphagnum-dominated peatlands-and caution must be used when extrapolating data from a single site to the landscape scale, even for outwardly very similar peatlands. Instead, the macroscale development of peatlands, and concomitantly their microtopography as expressed in the proportion of hummocks, hollows, lawns and pools, need to be considered as central controls over CH4 emissions.

AB Testate amoebae are an abundant and functionally important group of protists in peatlands, but little is known about the seasonal patterns of their communities. We investigated the relationships between testate amoeba diversity and community structure and water table depth and light conditions (shading vs. insolation) in a Sphagnum peatland in Northern Poland (Linje mire) in spring and summer 2010. We monitored the water table at five sites across the peatland and collected Sphagnum samples in lawn and hummock micro-sites around each piezometer, in spring (3 May) and mid-summer (6 August) 2010. Water table differed significantly between micro-sites and seasons (Kruskal Wallis test, p = 0.001). The community structure of testate amoebae differed significantly between spring and summer in both hummock and lawn micro-sites. We recorded a small, but significant drop in Shannon diversity, between spring and summer (1.76 vs. 1.72). Strongest correlations were found between testate amoeba communities and water table lowering and light conditions. The relative abundance of mixotrophic species Hyalosphenia papilio, Archerella flavum and of Euglypha ciliata was higher in the summer. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB On a global basis, peatlands are a major reserve of carbon (C). Hydrological changes can affect the decomposition processes in peatlands and in turn can alter their C balance. Since 1959, a groundwater extraction plant has generated a water-level gradient at our study site that has gradually changed part of the wet fen into a dry peatland forest. The average water-level drawdown of the gradient (from a pristine 9 cm to 26 cm in the dry end) is close to an estimate predicted by an increase in mean global temperature of 3 degrees C. We studied the total microbial community of the aerobic surface peat in four locations along the gradient through phospholipid fatty acid and PCR-DGGE methods. Additionally, field measurements of soil respiration showed a threefold increase in the C-emission rate at the driest location compared with the wettest one, indicating enhanced decomposition. Also, both fungal and bacterial biomass increased in the drier locations. At the species level, the fungal community changed due to water-level drawdown whereas actinobacteria were less sensitive to drying. The majority of fungal sequences were similar to ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, which dominated throughout the gradient. Our results indicate that ECM fungi might act as important facultative decomposers in organic-rich environments such as peatlands.

AB The Kwakshua Watersheds Observatory (KWO) is an integrative watersheds observatory on the coastal margin of a rain-dominated bog-forest landscape in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Established in 2013, the goal of the KWO is to understand and model the flux of terrestrial materials from land to sea - the origins, pathways, processes and ecosystem consequences - in the context of long-term environmental change. The KWO consists of seven gauged watersheds and a network of observation sites spanning from land to sea and along drainage gradients within catchments. Time-series datasets include year-round measurements of weather, soil hydrology, streamflow, aquatic biogeochemistry, microbial ecology and nearshore oceanographic conditions. Sensor measurements are recorded every 5 min and water samples are collected approximately monthly. Additional observations are made during high-flow conditions. We used remote sensing to map watershed terrain, drainage networks, soils and terrestrial ecosystems. The watersheds range in size from 3.2 to 12.8 km(2), with varying catchment characteristics that influence hydrological and biogeochemical responses. Despite local variation, the overall study area is a global hotspot for yields of dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen and dissolved iron at the coastal margin. This observatory helps fill an important gap in the global network of observatories, in terms of spatial location (central coast of BC), climate (temperate oceanic), hydrology (very high runoff, pluvial regime), geology (igneous intrusive, glacially scoured), vegetation (bog rainforest) and soils (large stores of organic carbon).

AB Mire ecosystems in Western Siberia play a significant role in the environment and sustain ecological balance in the biosphere. The aim of the research was to study the chemical and biological processes of mire pedogenesis and the influence of this process on the formation of the composition of bog water and its migration to surface waters. The research was carried out in the southern taiga zone of Western Siberia in a small catchment of the Klyuch River within a catena of geochemically linked mire landscapes. The chemical and microbiological properties of the peat soils were studied in autonomous, transitional, and accumulative geomorphic positions; their influence on the formation of chemical composition of bog water was determined in each position. It was shown that a predominance of certain plant associations (oligotrophic sphagnum, cotton grass, or sedges) caused the accumulation of organic matter of significantly different chemical compositions. The biochemical activity could be traced throughout the peat profiles and affected significantly the chemical composition of bog water. Bog water had certain individual chemical properties in each landscape position. The factors affecting the migration of substances and the removal of chemical compounds beyond the studied profile were determined. The overall removal of macroelements with runoff flows during the growing season amounted up to 4843 kg/km(2) for Ca2+, 51.7 kg/km(2) for total Fe, 1419.0 kg/km(2) for SO42-, 2.253 x 10(-3) kg/km(2) for Pb, 10.037 x 10(-3) kg/km(2) for Cu, 317.29 x 10(-3) kg/km(2) for Mn, 41.191 x 10(-3) kg/km(2) for Zn, 8.151 x 10(-3) kg/km(2) for Ni, and 29.651 x 10(-3) kg/km(2) for Ti. The removal of organic matter reached 583.2 kg C/km(2). The influence of bog water (especially, its organic components) on the water composition in the Klyuch River was clearly shown. Our data on the chemical composition of bog water in the system of geochemically linked more landscapes and on the bog water migration from the boggy catchment can be used to forecast the geochemical situation in the surface waters of boggy territories.

AB Although northern peatlands cover only 3% of the land surface, their thick peat deposits contain an estimated one-third of the world's soil organic carbon (SOC). Under a changing climate the potential of peatlands to continue sequestering carbon is unknown. This paper presents an analysis of 6 years of total carbon balance of an almost intact Atlantic blanket bog in Glencar, County Kerry, Ireland. The three components of the measured carbon balance were: the land-atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) and the flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exported in a stream draining the peatland. The 6 years C balance was computed from 6 years (2003-2008) of measurements of meteorological and eddy-covariance CO2 fluxes, periodic chamber measurements of CH4 fluxes over 3.5 years, and 2 years of continuous DOC flux measurements. Over the 6 years, the mean annual carbon was -29.7 +/- 30.6 (+/- 1 SD) g C m-2 yr-1 with its components as follows: carbon in CO2 was a sink of -47.8 +/- 30.0 g C m-2 yr-1; carbon in CH4 was a source of 4.1 +/- 0.5 g C m-2 yr-1 and the carbon exported as stream DOC was a source of 14.0 +/- 1.6 g C m-2 yr-1. For 2 out of the 6 years, the site was a source of carbon with the sum of CH4 and DOC flux exceeding the carbon sequestered as CO2. The average C balance for the 6 years corresponds to an average annual growth rate of the peatland surface of 1.3 mm yr-1.

AB 1. Cut-over peatlands cover large surfaces of high potential value for enhancing biodiversity and carbon sequestration if successfully restored. Unfortunately, evaluation of restoration success is not straightforward. We assessed the bioindicator value of organic matter (OM), testate amoebae (protozoa) and bacteria in peat from two regeneration stages and a reference site of a cut-over bog.
   2. Contrasting biochemical signatures of peat OM were observed along the regenerating profiles, allowing clear differentiation between the newly regenerated peat and the old peat. Where peat macrofossils were absent sugar biomarkers were used to infer peat botanical origin and OM alteration.
   3. Over the succession, the OM composition of the new peat differed. Peat from the more recent stage was dominated by Sphagnum-derived tissues and characterized by lower carbohydrate preservation and higher bacterial biomass than the advanced regeneration stage.
   4. Surface testate amoeba communities also changed from the recent to the advanced stages of regeneration, indicating a shift from wet and moderately acidic conditions to drier and more acidic conditions. Over this regeneration sequence (i) the biomass and average size of species declined but were higher at the unexploited site and (ii) species richness and diversity increased but density declined.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Although secondary succession in the cut-over bog led to an ecosystem similar to that of the reference site in terms of surface vegetation, OM and testate amoebae continued to reflect disturbances associated with peat harvesting. Nevertheless, the described dynamics of both microbial and biochemical variables over the succession showed similarities between the advanced stage and the reference site: a higher testate amoeba diversity was associated with better carbohydrate preservation and a more heterogeneous botanical composition of the peat. The inferred water table depth and pH based on testate amoebae indicators proved to be an alternative approach for assessing restoration processes, in contrast to labour-intensive repeated measurements in the field. The botanical and biochemical composition of peat OM provided additional information on past anthropogenic perturbations of the bog and could be used for restoration monitoring. The combination of several indicators therefore provides a more complete assessment of ecological conditions that could be valuable for the management of cut-over peatlands.

AB The composition of a peatland plant community has considerable effect on a range of ecosystem functions. Peatland plant community structure is predicted to change under future climate change, making the quantification of the direction and magnitude of this change a research priority. We subjected intact, replicated vegetated poor fen peat monoliths to elevated temperatures, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and two water table levels in a factorial design to determine the individual and synergistic effects of climate change factors on the poor fen plant community composition. We identify three indicators of a regime shift occurring in our experimental poor fen system under climate change: nonlinear decline of Sphagnum at temperatures 8 degrees C above ambient conditions, concomitant increases in Carex spp. at temperatures 4 degrees C above ambient conditions suggesting a weakening of Sphagnum feedbacks on peat accumulation, and increased variance of the plant community composition and pore water pH through time. A temperature increase of +4 degrees C appeared to be a threshold for increased vascular plant abundance; however the magnitude of change was species dependent. Elevated temperature combined with elevated CO2 had a synergistic effect on large graminoid species abundance, with a 15 times increase as compared to control conditions. Community analyses suggested that the balance between dominant plant species was tipped from Sphagnum to a graminoid-dominated system by the combination of climate change factors. Our findings indicate that changes in peatland plant community composition are likely under future climate change conditions, with a demonstrated shift toward a dominance of graminoid species in poor fens.

AB Water repellency alters soil hydrology after periods of wildfire, potentially modifying the ecosystem recovery to such disturbance. Despite this potential importance, the extent and severity of water repellency within burned peatlands and its importance in regulating peatland recovery to wildfire disturbance remains poorly understood. We characterised the water repellency of peat in a burned (one year post-fire) and unburned peatland in the Western Boreal Plain utilising the water drop penetration time and ethanol droplet molarity tests. Burned Sphagnum moss and feather moss sites had a more severe degree of water repellency than unburned sites, with differences being more pronounced between burned and unburned feather moss sites. Burned feather moss exhibited the most extreme water repellency, followed by unburned feather moss, and burned Sphagnum. The severity of water repellency varied with depth through the near surface of the moss/peat profile. This was most evident within the burned feathermoss where more extreme water repellency was observed at the near-surface compared to the surface, with the most extreme water repellency found at 1 and 5 cm depths. Unburned Sphagnum was completely hydrophilic at all depths. We suggest that the extreme water repellency in near-surface feather moss peat acts as a barrier that impedes the supply of water to the surface that replaces that lost via evaporation. This leads to drying of the near-surface vadose zone within feather moss areas and a concomitantly large decrease in peatland evaporation within feather moss dominated peatlands. This negative feedback mechanism likely enhances the resilience of such peatland to wildfire disturbance, maintaining a high water table position, thereby limiting peat decomposition. In comparison, such a feedback is not observed strongly within Sphagnum, leaving Sphagnum dominated peatlands potentially vulnerable to low water table positions post disturbance.

AB Since the re-establishment of a more natural water regime is considered by water management in wetlands with artificially stable water levels, the biogeochemical and ecological effects of water level fluctuation with different nutrient loads should be investigated. This is particularly important for biodiverse mesotrophic fens, sensitive to acidification and eutrophication. Mesocosm experiments were conducted to study the interactive effects of water level fluctuation and P-enrichment under controlled summer conditions, using peat cores including vegetation from three fens differing in biogeochemical characteristics.
   The effects of fluctuating water levels on biogeochemistry and vegetation appeared to be highly dependent on peat chemistry, and more important than the effects of P-enrichment. Only when plant growth was stimulated by a favorable water level regime, P-enrichment led to increased P-consumption by plants. In rich fens with a high soil Ca-content, 7 weeks of lowered water table (-15 cm) did not lead to a drop in pH. However, soil subsidence, increased N-availability and decline of the rich fen bryophyte Scorpidium scorpioides give cause to concern. 7 weeks of inundation (+15 cm) offered possibilities for restoration in these fens, since alkalinity and Ca-concentrations increased, while soil P-mobilization did not occur. Even P-enrichment did not result in increased P-availability, presumably due to Ca-related precipitation of P. In rich fens with a high soil Fe-content, water table lowering should be avoided as well, because of soil subsidence, increased N-availability, decline of the rich fen bryophyte Calliergon giganteum, plus acidification due to Fe-oxidation. Shallow inundation, however, is also harmful, especially after mowing and with P-rich water, because plant growth was hampered, presumably by toxicity of NH4+ and/or Fe(II). In mineral-poor fens with a high soil P- and S-content, shallow inundation should be avoided, because of tremendous internal P-mobilization. Vitality of the dominant bryophyte Sphagnum palustre, however, was not affected. Low water tables affected neither vegetation, nor biogeochemistry, showing resistance to short-term drought in these fens.
   Given the strong mediating effect of soil chemistry, risks and benefits of re-establishment of fluctuating water levels with clean or P-rich water need to be considered for different fen types separately in water and nature management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Plant communities in the terrestrial-aquatic transition zone in the paramo of Chingaza, Colombia. High Andean paramo ecosystems are an important water resource for many towns, and major cities in this region. The aquatic and wetland vegetation of different paramo lakes, pond, swamps and bogs was studied according to the classical phytosociological approach, which is based on homogenous stands, but excludes any border phenomena or transitional zone. The present research aimed at determining the aquatic and wetland vegetation along different moisture gradients. A total of 89 species in 30 transects were reported, of which Crassula venezuelensis, Carex bonplandii, Callitriche nubigena, Eleocharis macrostachya, Ranunculus flagelliformis, R. nubigenus, Eleocharis stenocarpa, Galium, ascendens y Alopecurus aequalis were present in more than one third of the transects. Numerical classification and indicator species analysis resulted in the definition of the next 18 communities: 1) Calamagrostis effusa, 2) Sphagnum cuspidation, 3) Cyperus rufus, 4) Eleocharis stenocarpa, 5) Carex acutata, 6) Poa annua, 7) Valeriana sp., 8) Ranunculus flagelliformis, 9) Carex bonplandii, 10) Festuca andicola, 11) Muhlenbergia fastigiata, 12) Elatine paramoana, 13) Isoetes palmeri, 14) Crassula venezuelensis, 15) Lilaeopsis macloviana, 16) Callitriche nubigena, 17) Potamogeton paramoanus and 18) Potamogeton illinoensis. The ordination of communities reveals the presence of three different aquatic-terrestrial gradients which are related to the life form structure of species that characterized the various communities. We concluded that patchiness and heterogeneity of the vegetation is mainly the result of alterations caused by human activities (burning, cattle raise and material extraction for road and darn construction).

AB Peatlands represent one of the most important water resources in the Puna grassland ecoregion, but this fact is not yet widely recognised. Puna peatlands also provide key environmental services such as increasing the regional biodiversity of the Andean Altiplano plateau and contributing to the wellbeing of high-altitude human populations by providing grazing land and cooking fuel. We conducted a study in the Peruvian Puna ecoregion to describe the current condition of peatlands in terms of their vegetation, physical and chemical characteristics and disturbance status. Our results suggest that peat thickness, organic matter and degree of humification are good indicators for identifying peatlands in the Puna ecoregion. In general, the peatland sites that we sampled were dominated by mixtures of cushion and acaulescent rosette forming plants such as Distichia muscoides Nees & Meyen and Plantago tubulosa Decne. These Distichia and Plantago peatland sites were characterised by a mean surface water pH of 6.3, corrected electrical conductivity (K corr.) in the range 300-1814 mu S cm(-1) and presented the following mean exchangeable cation values: Ca2+ 48 mg L-1, Mg2+ 9.6 mg L-1, Na+ 8.2 mg L-1 and K+ 2.1 mg L-1. The most common causes of disturbance we encountered were grazing, peat extraction and roads. Disturbance was most severe in mining sites, where peatlands are especially vulnerable because they are not under legal protection.

AB Net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange was measured in two contrasting peatlands in northern Alberta, Canada using the eddy covariance technique during the growing season (May-October). Sphagnum spp. made up approximately 66% of the total LAI (1.52 m(2) m(-2)) at the poor fen and the total N content of Sphagnum capitula was 7.8 mg g(-1) at the peak of the growing season. In contrast, the dominant plant species at the extreme-rich fen site, the perennial sedge, Carex lasiocarpa, accounted for approximately 60% of the total LAI (1.09 m(2) m(-2)), and had leaf total N content of 19.3 mg g(-1) at peak biomass. In addition, the peak aboveground biomass was higher at the poor fen (230.9 g m(-2)) than at the extreme-rich fen (157.1 g m(-2)). Both sites had maximum daily rates of net CO2 uptake of approximately 5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), and typical nighttime rates of CO2 loss of approximately 2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) during the peak of the growing season. Calculations of maximum photosynthetic and respiratory capacity were consistently higher at the extreme-rich fen. The poor fen was a net sink for CO2 during 4 of the 6 months (peaking at 44 g C m(-2) in July), while only slight net losses of CO2 (3 g C m(-2)) occurred in May and September. In contrast, the extreme-rich fen was calculated to be a significant net sink for CO2 only during 2 months of the growing season (peaking at 30 g C m(-2) in August), while significant net losses of CO2 occurred in May (8 g C m(-2)) and in October (13 g C m(-2)). The plant species at the poor fen site were active earlier and later in the growing season, while it took longer for C. lasiocarpa to develop leaf tissue, and leaf senescence and reduction in photosynthetic activity occurred earlier in the fall at the extreme-rich fen. When integrated over the 6-month growing season, the poor fen was a net sink (90 g C m(-2)) that was three times larger than the extreme-rich fen (31 g C m(-2)). The ratio of cumulative total ecosystem respiration to gross primary production was 0.7 at the poor fen and 0.9 at the extreme-rich fen. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new process-based distributed model, the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) integrated catchment-based ecohydrology (NICE) model, was developed. The model includes surface-unsaturated-saturated water processes and assimilates land-surface processes describing the variation in phenology with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) satellite data. The model was applied to the Kushiro River catchment (northern Japan, area of 2204.7 km(2)) with a resolution of 500 m and 8 days averaged vegetation changes. Excellent agreement between simulated and measured values was obtained for soil temperature, soil moisture, groundwater level, and river flow discharge during the 6 month snow-free period, achieved by taking into account vegetation phenology, soil properties, and geological structure. The model explains water cycle change and drying phenomena in the Kushiro Mire associated with vegetation change caused by the increased sediment load due to river channelization and consequently the invasion of alder ( Alnus japonica) into the mire.

DE BOG; DISTURBANCE; ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY; FEN; MINEROTROPHIC; SWAMP; PH
AB The structure of peatland vegetation in Minnesota is affected by trophic conditions, the soil-water regime, and the disturbance history.  Trophic conditions have a major effect on the species composition.  Structurally, this results in the exclusion of most tall shrubs, hardwood trees, and forbs from ombrotrophic sites and a greater biomass of mosses and ericad shrubs on those sites than on minerotrophic sites.  Classification of peatland vegetation into physiognomic groups provides reasonable estimates of total aboveground biomass.  Trophic conditions per se, however, have a minor effect on aboveground biomass; on both ombrotrophic and minerotrophic peatlands, biomass increases from less than 10 Mg ha-1 on the wettest sites to over 100 Mg ha-1 on the driest, undisturbed sites.  Peatland sites that have comparatively dry, well-aerated soils support dense forests if they have not recently been disturbed; shrubs dominate on those sites after disturbance.  Excessively wet sites are dominated by mosses (particularly on ombrotrophic peatlands) or graminoids (on minerotrophic peatlands).  On ombrotrophic sites, the relatively dry conditions that lead to higher tree and total biomass also lead to lower pH resulting in an inverse relationship between biomass and pH.

AB Rich fens are common boreal ecosystems with distinct hydrology, biogeochemistry and ecology that influence their carbon (C) balance. We present growing season soil chamber methane emission (F-CH4), ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary production (GPP) fluxes from a 9-years water table manipulation experiment in an Alaskan rich fen. The study included major flood and drought years, where wetting and drying treatments further modified the severity of droughts. Results support previous findings from peatlands that drought causes reduced magnitude of growing season F-CH4, GPP and NEE, thus reducing or reversing their C sink function. Experimentally exacerbated droughts further reduced the capacity for the fen to act as a C sink by causing shifts in vegetation and thus reducing magnitude of maximum growing season GPP in subsequent flood years by similar to 15% compared to control plots. Conversely, water table position had only a weak influence on ER, but dominant contribution to ER switched from autotrophic respiration in wet years to heterotrophic in dry years. Droughts did not cause interannual lag effects on ER in this rich fen, as has been observed in several nutrient-poor peatlands. While ER was dependent on soil temperatures at 2 cm depth, F-CH4 was linked to soil temperatures at 25 cm. Inter-annual variability of deep soil temperatures was in turn dependent on wetness rather than air temperature, and higher F-CH4 in flooded years was thus equally due to increased methane production at depth and decreased methane oxidation near the surface. Short-term fluctuations in wetness caused significant lag effects on F-CH4, but droughts caused no inter-annual lag effects on F-CH4. Our results show that frequency and severity of droughts and floods can have characteristic effects on the exchange of greenhouse gases, and emphasize the need to project future hydrological regimes in rich fens.

AB The net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and methane (CH4) flux were measured by chamber measurements for five distinct ecotypes (areas with unique eco-hydrological characteristics) at Abbeyleix Bog in the Irish midlands over a 2-year period. The ecotypes ranged from those with high-quality peat-forming vegetation to communities indicative of degraded, drained conditions. Three of these ecotypes were located in an area where peat was extracted by hand and then abandoned and left to revegetate naturally at least 50 years prior to the start of the study. Two of the ecotypes were located on an adjacent raised bog, which although never mined for peat, was impacted by shallow drainage and then restored (by drain blocking) 6 years prior to the start of the study. Other major aspects of the carbon (C) balance, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and open-water CO2 evasion, were quantified for a catchment area at the study site over the same 2-year period. The ecotype average annual ecotype C balance ranged from a net C sink of -58 +/- 60 gCm(-2) yr(-1), comparable to studies of intact peatlands, to a substantial C source of C +205 +/- 80 gC m(-2) yr(-1), with NEE being the most variable component of the C balance among the five ecotypes. Ecotype annual CH4 flux ranged from 2.7 +/- 1.4 g C-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) to 14.2 +/- 4.8 g C-CH4 m(-2)yr(-1). Average annual aquatic C losses were 14.4 gCm(-2) yr(-1) with DOC, DIC, and CO2 evasion of 10.4 g Cm(-2)yr(-1), 1.3 g Cm-2 yr(-1), and 2.7 g Cm-2 yr(-1), respectively. A statistically significant negative correlation was found between the mean annual water table (MAWT) and the plot-scale NEE but not the global warming potential (GWP). However, a significant negative correlation was observed between the plot-scale percentage of Sphagnum moss cover and the GWP, highlighting the importance of regenerating this keystone genus as a climate change mitigation strategy in peatland restoration. The data from this study were then compared to the rapidly growing number of peatland C balance studies across boreal and temperate regions. The trend in NEE and CH4 flux with respect to MAWT was compared for the five ecotypes in this study and literature data from degraded/restored/recovering peatlands, intact peatlands, and bare peat sites.

AB Peatlands contain a globally significant store (30%) of soil carbon (C). Within the Canadian Western Boreal Plains, where peatlands are a dominant feature, the climate is becoming warmer and drier, coupled with an increase in forest fire incidence. The response of peatlands to forest fire is likely to be a key determinant in the future of C storage of Boreal peatlands. This study examined the impacts of fire on key environmental controls on CO2 fluxes at the plot-scale (using static chambers) between burned and unburned understory vegetation throughout the growing season of 2017 in a treed fen impacted by the Horse River wildfire (2016) in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. Both gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and total respiration (R-tot) were less at burned plots compared with unburned. Temporal patterns varied between the plots, where both component of CO2 fluxes at the unburned plots were largest in June, whereas at the burned plots, CO2 fluxes peaked in the late growing season. GEP and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) showed a positive relationship with depth of burn, with the deepest burned areas showing significantly greater CO2 uptake(,) coinciding with both increased bioavailable phosphorus and greater moss recolonization. At the unburned plots, soil temperature was a dominant control on CO2 fluxes. This work demonstrates the importance of the depth of burn to post-fire carbon fluxes and how a knowledge of burn severity and depth can inform understanding of the recovery trajectory of northern peatlands following fire disturbance.

AB [1] If boreal peatlands face drought more often due to climatic warming, the responses of vegetation may drastically change the functions of the ecosystem. We assessed the effects of water-level drawdown on plant-mediated organic matter (OM) and nutrient fluxes in a chronosequence of undrained and drained, originally sparsely treed fens. The chronosequence mimicked the reduced growing season moisture predicted by current climate change scenarios. In a pristine state, OM and nutrient fluxes were characterized by annual cycling through graminoids and mosses. Water-level drawdown initiated a "forest succession, '' in which the OM and nutrient cycles shifted from being dominated by graminoids and mosses to dominance by arboreal vegetation in two decades. Simultaneously, the quantity and tissue type composition of annual litterfall, as well as the quantity and allocation of annual nutrient uptake, changed radically. The changes may have contrasting but as yet unexplored implications for the carbon and nutrient balances of these sites.

AB Climate change is considered to alter the functioning of boreal peatland ecosystems, but the vulnerability of pristine, rewetted and drained peatlands to climate change in temperate regions is unknown. We measured carbon (C) gas exchange during wet (2009) and dry (2010) growing periods in pristine, drained and rewetted sites in mountain bogs in the Bohemian Forest (Czech Republic). Wetter lawns with sedges and drier habitats dominated by ericaceous shrubs were distinguished and studied at each site.
   Methane (CH4) emissions, which decreased in the order pristine > rewetted > drained, were generally lower during the 2010 growing period than in 2009 as a consequence of a drought. During the drought in 2010, photosynthesis (P-G) in the drier habitats with shrub vegetation increased on pristine and rewetted sites, while total respiration (R-ECO) remained the same. Communities dominated by sedges maintained similar rates of P-G and R-ECO during both growing periods. Generally, this led to higher C accumulation during the drought on pristine and rewetted bogs. At the drained bog site, the decreased water table (WT) during the drought led to increased P-G and R-ECO, such that the net C accumulation was similar in the two years.
   Drained peatlands may be more threatened by future climate change than pristine or rewetted peatlands because of their limited buffering capacity for decreased WT. In the case of further decreases in WT, they could lose the peatland vegetation and functions that have partly persisted through decades of drainage.

AB The vascular vegetation of a mire-grassland community on Marion Island (47-degrees-S, 38-degrees-E) takes up c. 158 mg N m-2 d-1 in summer. Bryophytes take up c. 36 mg N m-2 d-1 during their peak growth period. Since inputs of N through precipitation and biological fixation are negligible, mineralization of organic N must have supplied the bulk of this N. From changes in peat inorganic N levels and rates of uptake by the vegetation we estimate mean mineralization rates of 178 mg N m-2 d-1 in summer and 55 mg N m-2 d-1 in winter. In situ incubation of peat give a maximum mineralization rate of 48 mg N m-2 d-1. At this rate the small (700 mg m-2) pool of available N in the upper 25 cm of peat would be depleted by the vascular vegetation in about seven days and bryophytes would deplete the available N pool in the top 25 mm in two days. Hence the rate of N mineralization measured by incubation is much too low to account for the fluctuations in concentrations of inorganic N in the peat and the amounts taken up by the vegetation. This may be due to losses through denitrification or to the fact that soil macroinvertebrates were excluded from the incubation.

AB This study documents changes in community and functional group across environmental gradients sensitive to climate warming in boreal permafrost peatlands and describes how future changes in temperature and precipitation may lead to changes in species composition and ecosystem properties. At the landscape scale, the presence of permafrost strongly influenced species composition. The position of permafrost thaw affected surface water pH and species composition. At local scales, a combination of water table depth and vegetation structure strongly controlled community composition. Permafrost plateau plots with high Picea mariana basal area were characterized by darker and drier understorey conditions, low cover of Sphagnum fuscum, Ledum groenlandicum, and lichen, and high cover of feather mosses. Aquatic collapse scar plots were dominated by aquaticSphagnum and Carex, whereas more xeric plots were dominated by hummock Sphagnum and ericaceous shrubs. Functional group responses indicated that changing environmental conditions with climate warming may have significant impacts on community composition and ecosystem processes. A decomposition example is presented to show how changes in species and functional group composition could have important implications for ecosystem-level processes like peat accumulation during climate warming.

AB The near-pristine bog ecosystems of Tierra del Fuego in southernmost Patagonia have so far not been studied in terms of their current carbon dioxide (CO2) sink strength. CO2 flux data from Southern Hemisphere peat-lands are scarce in general. In this study, we present CO2 net ecosystem exchange (NEE) fluxes from two Fuegian bog ecosystems with contrasting vegetation communities. One site is located in a glaciogenic valley and developed as a peat moss-dominated raised bog, and the other site is a vascular plant-dominated cushion bog located at the coast of the Beagle Channel. We measured NEE fluxes with two identical eddy covariance (EC) setups at both sites for more than 2 years. With the EC method, we were able to observe NEE fluxes on an ecosystem level and at high temporal resolution. Using a mechanistic modeling approach, we estimated daily NEE models to gap fill and partition the half-hourly net CO2 fluxes into components related to photosynthetic uptake (gross primary production, GPP) and to total ecosystem respiration (TER). We found a larger relative variability of annual NEE sums between both years at the moss-dominated site. A warm and dry first year led to comparably high TER sums. Photosynthesis was also promoted by warmer conditions but less strongly than TER with respect to absolute and relative GPP changes. The annual NEE carbon (C) uptake was more than 3 times smaller in the warm year. Close to the sea at the cushion bog site, the mean temperature difference between both observed years was less pronounced, and TER stayed on similar levels. A higher amount of available radiation in the second observed year led to an increase in GPP (5 %) and NEE (35 %) C uptake. The average annual NEE-C uptake of the cushion bog (-122 +/- 76 gm(-2) a(-1), n = 2) was more than 4 times larger than the average uptake of the moss-dominated bog (-27 +/- 28 gm(-2) a(-1), n = 2).

AB The mid-high latitude permafrost peatlands in the Northern Hemisphere is a major natural source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Ecosystem scale CH4 emissions from a typical permafrost peatland in the Great Hing'an Mountains were observed during the growing season of 2014 and 2015 using the open-path eddy covariance method. Relevant environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation were also collected. There was a clear diurnal variation in methane emissions in the second half of each growing season, with significantly higher emission rates in the wet sector of study area. The daily CH4 exchange ranged from 1.8 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) to 40.2 mg CH4 m(-2) d-1 in 2014 and ranged from 3.9 to 15.0 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) in 2015. There were no peaks of CH4 fluxes during the spring thawing period. However; large peaks of CH4 emission were found in the second half of both growing seasons. The CH4 emission after Jul 25(th) accounted for 77.9% of total growing season emission in 2014 and 85.9% in 2015. The total CH4 emission during the growing season of 2014 and 2015 was approximately 1.52 g CH4 m(-2) and 0.71 g CH4 m-2, respectively. CH4 fluxes during the growing seasons were significantly correlated with thawing depth (R-2 = 0.71, P < 0.01,) and soil temperatures (R-2 = 0.75, P < 0.01) at 40 cm depth. An empirical equation using these two major variables was modified to estimate growing season CH4 emissions in permafrost peatlands. Our multiyear observations indicate that the time-lagged volume of precipitation during the growing season is a key factor in interpreting locally inter-annual variations in CH4 emissions. Our results suggested that the low temperature in the deep soil layers effectively restricts methane production and emission rates; these conditions may create significant positive feedback under global climate change.

AB Globally, peatlands store a large quantity of soil carbon that can be subsequently modified by hydrologic alterations from land-use change and climate change. However, there are many uncertainties in predicting how carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions are altered by long-term changes in hydrology. Therefore, the goal of this study was to quantify how multi-decadal manipulations of water table (WT) levels affected carbon cycling (plant production and net ecosystem exchange from three eddy covariance towers) in a peatland complex modified by levee construction, which created a wetter area up-gradient of the levee (mean WT was 12.1 cm below the surface), a dry area below the levee (36.8 cm), and an adjacent reference site not affected by the levee (21.6 cm). We found that mean total plant production was greatest in the reference site (311.9 g C m(-2) y(-1)), followed by the dry site (290.5 g C m(-2) y(-1)), and lowest in the wet site (227.1 g C m(-2) y(-1)). Net ecosystem exchange during the growing season was negative for all sites (sink), with the wet site having the greatest sink and the dry site having the lowest sink. Ecosystem respiration increased and CH4 emissions decreased with a decreasing WT level. This research demonstrates that human alteration of peatland WT levels can have long-term (> 50 years) consequences on peatland carbon cycling.

AB In the undisturbed floodplain of the Biebrza river (N.E. Poland) we compared vegetation composition, standing crop and the nutrients in standing crop to site factors such as flood duration and inundation depth during spring floods, summer water levels and concentrations of chemical constituents in water and nutrient release rates from peat. Our analysis shows a number of clear spatial patterns of biotic and abiotic variables in the ca. 1 km wide river marginal wetland. The distribution of vegetation types follows a certain pattern: Glycerietum maximae close to the river, followed by respectively Caricetum gracilis and Caricetum elatae and finally Calamagrostietum strictae at the margin of the river plain. Species richness increases and standing crop decreases from the river towards the margin. The elevation of the ground surface gently rises with increasing distance from the river; flood duration and flooding depths in spring decrease in the same direction. Groundwater tables in summer are less correlated to the elevation gradient but tend to be closer to the ground surface at the valley margin. These differences also lead to a higher amplitude close to the river and a fairly stable water table far away from the river. Concentrations of major ions and ammonium increase towards the river. Nutrient release rates are also higher closer to the river. Absence and presence of species and the variation in species composition of the vegetation was explained best by flood variables; variables from groundwater explained much less of the variance. Variations in standing crop and nutrients in standing crop corresponded better to the rates of nutrient release from the organic soil than to nutrient concentrations in the soil water. We concluded that river hydrology and nutrient release from the soil are clearly related to vegetation composition, species richness and productivity of the vegetation.

AB The relationship between alder (Alnus japonica) distribution and surrounding land use in Kushiro Mire was spatially assessed using remotely sensed imagery. From the result, it was found out that the expanding area of alder trees in Kushiro Mire was affected by the agricultural land area in the upper course of the river basin and flooding in the lower course of the river. The soil sediments flowing into the Kushiro Mire from the agricultural land resulted in heavy sedimentation that favors the growth of alder trees. Consequently, the number and density of alder trees has increased. The future distribution of alder trees was predicted based on the mechanism of expansion of the alder-tree area in Kushiro Mire, and it was found that large vegetation areas in Kushiro Mire will be changed to areas with alder trees.

AB We present the first 7500 yr long multi-proxy record from a raised bog located at the southern Baltic coast, Poland. Testate amoebae, plant macrofossils, pollen and microscopic charcoal were used to reconstruct environmental changes in Pomerania (northern Poland, Kaszuby Lakeland) from a 7-m thick peat archive of Stazki bog dated 5500 BC AD 1250. We obtained a record of proxies representing different spatial scales: regional vegetation changed simultaneously with local vegetation, and testate amoebae showed a pattern of change similar to that of pollen and plant macrofossils. On the basis of the combined proxies, we distinguished three hydroclimatic stages: moist conditions 5500-3450 BC, drier conditions with regionally increased fires up to 600 BC, and again moist conditions from 600 BC onward. During the drier interval, a first climatic shift to wetter conditions at 1700 BC is indicated by regional pollen as the replacement of Corylus by Carpinus, and locally by, e.g., the increase of Hyalosphenia elegans and mire plants such as Sphagnum sec. Cuspidata. Furthermore, we observed a correlation since 600 BC among the re-expansion of Carpinus (after a sudden decline ca. 950 BC), increased peat accumulation, increase of Hyalosphenia species, and fewer fires, suggesting lower evapotranspiration and a stable high water table in the bog. Fagus started to expand after AD 810 gradually replacing Carpinus, which was possibly due to a gradually more oceanic climate, though we cannot exclude human impact on the forests. Peat accumulation, determined by radiocarbon dating, varied with bog surface wetness. The hydroclimatic phases found in Stazki peatland are similar to moisture changes recorded in other sites from Poland and Europe. This is the first detailed record of hydroclimatic change during the Holocene in the southern Baltic region, so it forms a reference site for further studies on other southern Baltic bogs that are in progress.

AB Climate warming may increase the size and frequency of fires in the boreal biome, possibly causing greater carbon release that amplifies warming. However, in peatlands, vegetation change may also control long-term fire and carbon accumulation, confounding simple relationships between climate, fire, and carbon accumulation. Using 17 peat cores dating to 8000 cal years B. P. from northern Manitoba, Canada, we addressed the following questions: (1) Do past climate changes correlate with shifts in peatland vegetation? (2) What is the relationship between peatland vegetation and fire severity? (3) What is the mean return interval for boreal peat fires, and how does it change across fires of different severities? (4) How does fire severity affect carbon accumulation rates? (5) Do fire and long-term carbon accumulation change directly in response to climate or indirectly though climate-driven changes in vegetation? We measured carbon accumulation rates, fire severity, and return intervals using macroscopic charcoal and changes in vegetation using macrofossils. Climate and vegetation changes covaried, with shifts from wetter fen to drier, forested bog communities during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM). Fires became more severe following the shift to forested bogs, with fire severity peaking after 4000 cal years B. P. rather than during the HTM. Rising fire severity, in turn, was correlated with a significant decrease in carbon accumulation from similar to 6000 to 2000 cal years B. P. The Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age affected vegetation composition and permafrost, further impacting fire and carbon accumulation. Our results indicate that long-term changes in fire and carbon dynamics are mediated by climate-driven changes in vegetation.

AB The azonal paramo vegetation present at the top of Ramal de Guaramacal in the Venezuelan Andes was studied by means of observations, plant collections and surveys consisting of a total of 71 small plots of between 0.25 to 6 m(2). Azonal vegetation is represented in the study area by habitats experiencing water stress (peat bogs and aquatic vegetation). The azonal vegetation present in two peat bogs areas of Paramo El Pumar (Laguna El Pumar y Laguna Seca), and in a small valley where water collects in Paramo de Guaramacal, near the 'Las Antenas' area between similar to 2900 and similar to 3000 in were analyzed. A total of 53 morphospecies, belonging to 30 species of vascular plants, 20 species of cryptogams and 3 undetermined species of algae have been documented for the azonal vegetation. The interpretation of a TWINSPAN clustering, based on affinities of floristic composition and species cover, allowed the recognition of six azonal vegetation communities grouped into three alliances and one order. The new alliance Sphagno recurvi-Paepalanthion pilosi groups the new bunchgrass paramo association Paepalantho pilosi-Agrostietum basalis and the both new Sphagnum bog associations: Sphagno recurvi-Caricetum bonplandii and Sphagno sparsi-Caricetum bonplandii. The new alliance Carici bonplandii-Chusqueion angustifolia contains a bamboo paramo ('chuscal') association Carici bonplandii-Chusqueetum angustifoliae growing close to the lake shores, in periodically flooded areas, and characterized almost exclusively by Chusquea angustifolia. The alliance Districho submersi-Isoetion Cleef 1981 is represented by the submerged aquatic community of Sphagnum cuspidatum and the Isoetetum karstenii Cleef 1981.

AB Peatland ecosystems are important carbon sinks, but also release carbon back to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and methane. Peatlands therefore play an essential role in the global carbon cycle. However, the response of high-latitude peatlands to ongoing climate change is still not fully understood. In this study, we used plant macrofossils and peat property analyses as proxies to document changes in vegetation and peat and carbon accumulation after the Little Ice Age. Results from 12 peat monoliths collected in high-boreal and low-subarctic regions in northwestern Quebec, Canada, suggest high carbon accumulation rates for the recent past (post AD 1970s). Successional changes in plant assemblages were asynchronous within the cores in the southernmost region, but more consistent in the northern region. Average apparent recent carbon accumulation rates varied between 50.7 and 149.1 g C m(-2) yr(-1) with the northernmost study region showing higher values. The variation in vegetation records and peat properties found within samples taken from the same sites and amongst cores taken from different regions highlights the need to investigate multiple records from each peatland, but also from different peatlands within one region.

AB Resource extraction and transportation activities in subarctic Canada can result in the unintentional release of contaminants into the surrounding peatlands. In the event of a release, a thorough understanding of solute transport within the saturated zone is necessary to predict plume fate and the potential impacts on peatland ecosystems. To better characterize contaminant transport in these systems, approximately 13,000 L/day of sodium chloride tracer (200 mg/L) was released into a bog in the James Bay Lowland. The tracer was pumped into a fully penetrating well (1.5 m) between July 5 and August 18, 2015. Horizontal and vertical plume development was measured via in situ specific conductance and water table depth from an adaptive monitoring network. Over the spill period, the bulk of the plume travelled a lateral distance of 100 m in the direction of the slight regional groundwater and topographical slope. The plume shape was irregular and followed the hollows, indicating preferential flow paths due to the site microtopography. Saturated transport of the tracer occurred primarily at similar to 25 cm below ground surface (bgs), and at a discontinuous high hydraulic conductivity layer similar to 125 cm bgs due to a complex and heterogeneous vertical hydraulic conductivity profile. Plume measurement was confounded by a large amount of precipitation (233 mm over the study period) that temporarily diluted the tracer in the highly conductive upper peat layer. Longitudinal solute advection can be approximated using local water table information (i.e., depth and gradient); microtopography; and meteorological conditions. Vertical distribution of solute within the peat profile is far more complex due to the heterogeneous subsurface; characterization would be aided by a detailed understanding of the site-specific peat profile; the degree of decomposition; and the type of contaminant (e.g., reactive/nonreactive). The results of this research highlight the difficulty of tracking a contaminant spill in bogs and provide a benchmark for the characterization of the short-term fate of a plume in these complex systems.

AB Questions How to map floristic variation in a patterned fen in an ecologically meaningfully way? Can plant communities be delineated with species data generalized into plant functional types? What are the benefits and drawbacks of the two selected remote-sensing approaches in mapping vegetation patterns, namely: (a) regression models of floristically defined fuzzy plant community clusters and (b) classification of predefined habitat types that combine vegetation and land cover information? Location Treeless 0.4 km(2) mesotrophic string-flark fen in Kaamanen, northern Finland. Methods We delineated plant community clusters with fuzzy c-means clustering based on two different inventories of plant species and functional type distribution. We used multiple optical remote-sensing data sets, digital elevation models and vegetation height models derived from drone, aerial and satellite platforms from ultra-high to very high spatial resolution (0.05-3 m) in an object-based approach. We mapped spatial patterns for fuzzy and crisp plant community clusters using boosted regression trees, and fuzzy and crisp habitat types using supervised random forest classification. Results Clusters delineated with species-specific data or plant functional type data produced comparable results. However, species-specific data for graminoids and mosses improved the accuracy of clustering in the case of flarks and string margins. Mapping accuracy was higher for habitat types (overall accuracy 0.72) than for fuzzy plant community clusters (R-2 values between 0.27 and 0.67). Conclusions For ecologically meaningful mapping of a patterned fen vegetation, plant functional types provide enough information. However, if the aim is to capture floristic variation in vegetation as realistically as possible, species-specific data should be used. Maps of plant community clusters and habitat types complement each other. While fuzzy plant communities appear to be floristically most accurate, crisp habitat types are easiest to interpret and apply to different landscape and biogeochemical cycle analyses and modeling.

AB Peat is still mined in many parts of the World. What to do with the peatlands after the peat mining has stopped is a question for restoration ecologists and to leave a disturbed site to spontaneous regeneration could be one option. The main question of our study was whether it is an effective means of restoration and under which circumstances. Spontaneous succession was studied in 11 industrially mined peatlands, which encompassed successional stages of different age. Vegetation samples (109), 5 m x 5 m in size, were recorded in the stages using visual estimation of percentage cover of all present vascular plants. The age, abiotic environmental characteristics (position of water table, water pH, and substratum chemistry), as well as biotic characteristics (proportion of land cover categories up to 100 m, 300 m and 1 km from each sample, and the distance to the nearest undisturbed peatland vegetation) were assessed for each sampled successional stage. Other characteristics were related to the whole localities (altitude, average annual temperature, and precipitation). The data were analyzed by multivariate statistics. The environmental variables, except K-content and land cover up to 100 m, exhibited some significant effects on the vegetation patterns. External, i.e., landscape factors, had together a larger effect on the course of succession than abiotic site factors. The most important particular factors included ground water level, substrate pH, and presence of undisturbed peatland vegetation in the surroundings. Also important was geographic location predominantly reflecting site altitude. Spontaneous recovery of the peatland vegetation was more successful on those sites where the water table was intentionally increased. The increase of the water table after peat extraction and preservation of the original undisturbed peatland vegetation in the area neighbouring a mined site during the process of peat extraction are recommended to promote spontaneous recovery of the peatlands.

AB We present a high-resolution peat paleodust and accumulation rate record spanning the last 8300 years from Draftinge Mosse (400 ha), southern Sweden (57 degrees 06'27.6 '' N 13 degrees 42'54.1 '' E). The record was analysed for peat accumulation rates (PAR), elemental concentrations, mineralogy, and plant macrofossil content. Five periods of increased mineral deposition were recorded. The first event occurred between similar to 6280 and similar to 5570 cal BP, during the fen to bog transition. This is followed by four atmospheric mineral dust events (DE) which were recorded in the ombrotrophic section of the sequence at (cal BP): similar to 2200; similar to 1385-1150; similar to 830-590, and from similar to 420 to the present. Statistical analysis and elemental ratios indicated that both the mineralogy and grain size shifted when the system transitioned from fen into bog, showing that the governing transport process shifted with the peat-land succession stages. This highlights the importance of identifying peatland succession stages within peat paleodust studies. Following all four DE, increases in PAR were observed, implying a coupling to dust deposition. Comparison of DE and PAR with a paleodust record from Store Mosse, a 20 times larger bog located ca 18 km away (Kylander et al. 2016), showed that both PAR and dust deposition are largely represented by single-core reconstructions, indicating that they are driven by a common climate forcing mechanism. However, higher PAR and dust deposition rates were observed in the more moderately sized Draftinge Mosse, suggesting that the size of the bog is important to consider in peat paleodust studies. Furthermore, the smaller bog responded more rapidly to hydrological changes, indicating that the size of the bog affects its' buffering capacity. Authigenic carbonates, observed here during episodes of rapid peat growth, coincide with changes in REE ratios, indicating that authigenic peat processes potentially cause REE fractionation.

AB In this study, a reconstruction of the long-term development and lateral expansion of a south Swedish peat bog was performed using a multi-proxy approach, including dendrochronology, peat stratigraphy and macrofossil and pollen analyses. By combining mapping of cross-dated subfossil trees with radiocarbon-dated peat sequences, an improved approach to reconstruction of lateral peat expansion was applied. Apart from providing approximate ages of tree burial episodes, the ring-width records offer information on hydrological variations prior to the bog expansion. New bog oak, pine and alder chronologies are presented and their potential as a dating tool for peatland expansion as well as for local to regional environmental interpretations is examined. Our tree-replication records show that increased amounts of bog trees in the central parts can be linked to drier bog-surface conditions, whereas an increase in wood remains in the marginal zone is related to enhanced preservation due to lateral bog expansion. Our reconstructions of the development of the peat deposit and associated changes in the distribution of vegetation communities provide new insight into peatland responses to climate change at the end of the 'Holocene Thermal Maximum' (5000-4000 cal. yr BP).

AB Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is one of the most important auxin/phytohormones for plant growth. The effect of peat botanical composition of various vegetation cover and peat-forming species at 13 sampling points located in fens, bogs and drained peatlands on the content of IAA, hot water extractable organic carbon (C-HWE), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and C/N quotient was assessed. The objective of this study was to analyse comparatively the quantities of IAA, TOC, C-HWE, TN and C/N in peats of varying genesis with respect to the peculiarities of their origin due to the botanical composition of vegetation cover and peat-forming species. A high content of IAA, C-HWE and TN was found in the top layers of the peatlands, indicating the formation of IAA mainly by the roots of peat-forming species and rhizosphere bacteria, because of the rich supplies of chemical and biochemical compounds exuded from the roots. Drainage of the peatlands did not have a significant effect on the amounts of IAA and TOC, but contributed to the release of large amounts of C-HWE (mainly representative of labile carbon). High TOC contents and C/N quotients in deeper layers of the peat deposits indicated a decline in the rate of soil organic matter (SOM) mineralisation and accumulation of the recalcitrant fraction. Varying C/N quotients of peat-forming species may reflect the initial botanical composition of the vegetation cover or peat-forming species, or differences in the degree of decomposition and/or TN content of the peats.

AB Land-use conversion of pristine boreal peatlands for agricultural purposes is an ongoing process and projected to become more intensive with rising population growth and increased demands for food production. However, agricultural use of peatlands affects the production and emission of nitrous oxide (N2O), a very potent greenhouse gas currently gaining more attention in the global assessment of greenhouse gases. While the intensity of N2O emissions depends on a range of environmental factors, including hydrological parameters, temperature and the availability of nitrogen in soils, key driving processes remain poorly understood. In order to understand the effects of land-use change on the peatland ecosystem, we quantified N2O fluxes under different land-use in a comparative study between a natural bog and an adjacent abandoned pasture in Newfoundland, Canada. We conducted in situ gas flux measurements using the static chamber method over five growing seasons. In addition, we measured photosynthetic rates and environmental parameters, namely soil temperature and moisture, water table and concentrations of total nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon in pore waters. According to previous studies, we hypothesized higher N2O emissions from the abandoned pasture due to drainage compared to the natural bog. However, despite significant differences of environmental parameters and photosynthetic rates, we found no significant difference of N2O fluxes between the two sites. We argue that N2O production at the abandoned pasture was inhibited due to exhaustion of plant-available nitrogen as a result of increased gross primary production compared to the natural bog. We conclude that the effect of drainage and fertilization on N2O fluxes during the growing season was superposed by vegetation composition change effects at the abandoned pasture, leading to similar N2O fluxes at both sites.

AB The chemical composition of peat cores sampled from nine drained peatland catchments overlying either black schist or felsic bedrock was studied in Finland. Black schist is enriched in heavy metals, sulphur and graphitic carbon, and therefore it is susceptible to weathering whereas felsic rock types in the study region are more resistant and contain only negligible amounts of heavy metals, sulphur and carbon. A total of nineteen cores down to the underlying regolith were taken and electrical conductivity was measured in the field. The peat cores were divided into 160 peat samples for the determination of chemical composition and acidity. As a result of weathering, diffusion into the ground water and adsorption by the peat, concentrations of As, Co, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Zn, and S, as well as electrical conductivity were expected to be greater in the peat overlying black schist than in peat overlying felsic rocks and this difference was assumed to be strong in the bottom layers and to weaken near the surface. The basal Carex (sedge) peat layer showed elevated concentrations of elements compared to the upper Sphagnum (moss) peat layers. The effect of peatland margins and flooding also exerts some influence on higher Cu, S and Fe concentrations. Ambient environmental features and conditions, such as slope and aspect affected peat chemistry in two catchments in particular. The first catchment showed high heavy metal and trace element contents associated with peat accumulation on sloping terrain, as ground water discharges at a spring on a rather steeply sloping surface. Another catchment with lower heavy metal and trace element contents represents peat accumulation in a well-leached watershed characterized by sandy deposits within a flat valley floor and an acidity that induced the development of a Sphagnum bog phase during the early stages of mire formation. In addition to the chemical concentration of underlying bedrock and soil, the factors affecting element concentrations in peat were the topography of the environment including paludification mode and species composition and the subsiding relations of the peatland and drainage. Special caution should be paid when excavation is carried out on sites containing high sulphide concentrations in bedrock, overburden or peat, e.g. ditch network maintenance or peat harvest can lead to enhanced leaching of acidity and heavy metals. Anthropogenic activities on sulphide rich peatlands pose an environmental risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil organic matter distributions, reservoirs, and mineralization rates in tundra soils are important factors for understanding biogeochemical carbon cycling. This study focuses on spatial trends and environmental controls of soil carbon distribution and microbial soil respiration in 4 tundra vegetation communities in an arctic valley in NE-Greenland (74 degrees N), including Dryas and Cassiope heaths, Salix snow bed, and fen vegetation. Measured total soil organic carbon in the upper 50 cm averaged (-+/-SD) 11.0 +/- 1.5 kg C m(-2) with spatial variations strongly affected by vegetation, hydrology, and buried organic layers. Observed Soil CO2 concentrations and effluxes were simulated with a steady-state diffusion model using laboratory measured CO2 productions as input. Simulated CO2 profiles and CO2 effluxes (up to 3 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) agreed with field observations and revealed the importance of both vegetation- and depth-specific CO2 production and CO2 diffusion for understanding the spatial variation in near-surface Soil CO2 gas dynamics. These results confirm that molecular diffusion dominates gas transport in the studied soils; but also that the complexity Of CO2 production/transport coupled to soil heterogeneity (in particular the litter layer) complicates the application of soil-diffusion models to estimate seasonal trends of soil gas effluxes.

AB Question: Which restoration measures (introduction of donor diaspore material, application of straw mulch, alteration of residual peat depths) contribute to the establishment of a fen plant community on minerotrophic surfaces after peat mining?
   Location: Riviere-du-Loup peatland, southern Quebec, Canada at 100 m a.s.l.
   Methods: The effectiveness of introducing fen plants with the application of donor diaspore material was tested. The donor diaspore material. containing seeds, rhizomes, moss fragments, and other plant propagules, was collected from two different types of natural fens. We tested whether the application of straw mulch would increase fen species cover and biodiversity compared to control plots without straw mulch. Terrace levels of different peat depths (15 cm, 40 cm, and 56 cm) were created to test the effects of different environmental site conditions on the success of re-vegetation.
   Results: Applying donor seed bank from natural fens was found to significantly increase fen plant cover and richness after the two growing seasons. Straw mulch proved to significantly increase fen plant richness. The intermediate terrace level (40 cm) had the highest fen plant establishment. Compared to reference sites. the low terrace level (15 cm) was richer in base cations. whereas the high terrace level (56 cm) was much drier.
   Conclusions: The application of donor diaspore material was demonstrated as an effective technique for establishing vascular fen plants. Further rewetting measures are considered necessary at the restoration site to create a fen ecosystem rather than simply restoring some fen species.

AB Southern South American peatlands (SSAP) play a key role in the ecological dynamics of Patagonia. They mostly comprise of undisturbed environments which provide important ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, water reservoir and habitat for both widespread and endemic organisms. When compared with boreal peatlands, our knowledge of the functioning of SSAP is poor, and it is necessary to raise awareness about their scientific and ecological value and to ensure their conservation. This article examines a broad base of historical and contemporary published research literature on the peatlands of Chile and Argentina, from 1843 onwards, to identify gaps in knowledge, implications for the assessment of peatland functioning, and targets for peatland conservation and management. To achieve this goal, we reviewed a total of 196 research papers/reports from across the peer-reviewed and grey literature. We conclude that gaps in our knowledge and understanding of SSAP have deeply undermined the development of effective conservation strategies for these understudied ecosystems. To reverse this situation, we recommend that future research and management efforts should aim: (1) to build an inventory of the peatlands that exist in SSAP, including their location and area; (2) to ensure land use planning prioritises the maintenance of SSAP ecosystem services; (3) to improve existing legislation and protocols of good and sustainable practice for extractive activities; and (4) to carry out an extensive awareness campaign aimed at the local population and key decision makers.

AB A database of 335 radiocarbon dates from Holocene fluvial sediments in Poland has been compiled. Each sample is characterized by 25 parameters. All samples were grouped into one of 7 regions characterized by hydrological regime, and one of 8 depositional environments. Statistical analysis was used to enhance the palaeoenvironmental data and 17 phases may be distinguished, 10 of which have a distinct sharp peak. Abandoned paleochannels (149 dates) clearly reflect the major wetter phases of the Holocene. An opposite picture is presented by overbank aggradation (86 dates) connected mainly with expansion of agriculture.
   Preliminary correlations are made on peat bog records, changes in vegetation, lake water level, rates calcareous tufa and speleothems growth, landslides phases and debris flow phases. These show many convergences, explained by climatic fluctuations during the Holocene. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems contribute almost equally to the sequestration of ca 50 per cent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and already play a role in minimizing our impact on Earth's climate. On land, the majority of the sequestered carbon enters soil carbon stores. Almost one-third of that soil carbon can be found in peatlands, an area covering just 2-3% of the Earth's landmass. Peatlands are thus well established as powerful agents of carbon capture and storage; the preservation of archaeological artefacts, such as ancient bog bodies, further attest to their exceptional preservative properties. Peatlands have higher carbon storage densities per unit ecosystem area than either the oceans or dry terrestrial systems. However, despite attempts over a number of years at enhancing carbon capture in the oceans or in land-based afforestation schemes, no attempt has yet been made to optimize peatland carbon storage capacity or even to harness peatlands to store externally captured carbon. Recent studies suggest that peatland carbon sequestration is due to the inhibitory effects of phenolic compounds that create an 'enzymic latch' on decomposition. Here, we propose to harness that mechanism in a series of peatland geoengineering strategies whereby molecular, biogeochemical, agronomical and afforestation approaches increase carbon capture and long-term sequestration in peat-forming terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Ecosystem restoration frequently involves the reintroduction of plant material in the degraded ecosystem. When there are no plant nurseries or seeds available on the market, the plant material has to be harvested in the wild, in a "donor ecosystem." A comprehensive assessment of donor ecosystem recovery is lacking, especially for Sphagnum-dominated donor peatlands, where all top vegetation is harvested mechanically with different practices. We aimed to evaluate (1) the regeneration of vegetation, especially of Sphagnum mosses, to determine which harvesting practices are best to enhance recovery and (2) the influence of the site hydrological conditions and meteorological variables of the first complete growing season postharvesting on peat moss regeneration. Twenty-five donor sites covering a 17-year chronosequence (harvested 1-17 years ago) were inventoried along with 15 associated natural reference sites located in Quebec, New Brunswick, and Alberta, Canada. All donor sites aged 10 years or more were dominated by Sphagnum mosses, though plant composition varied between donor and their associated reference sites because of the wetter conditions at harvested donor sites. Harvesting practices strongly influenced donor site recovery, showing that the skills of the practitioner are an essential ingredient. Harvesting practices minimizing donor site disturbances are recommended, such as the choice of the adequate donor site (localization, hydrologic conditions, vegetation), the use of less disruptive methods, and harvesting when the soil is deeply frozen. This study demonstrated that harvesting surface plant material for peatland restoration is not detrimental towards the recovery of near-natural peatland ecosystems.

AB Drainage and afforestation of peatlands cause extensive habitat degradation and species losses. Restoration supports peatland biodiversity by creating suitable habitat conditions, including stable high water tables. However, colonization by characteristic species can take decades or even fail. Peatland recovery is often monitored shortly after restoration, but initial trends may not continue, and results might differ among taxonomic groups. This study analyzes trends in plant, dragonfly, and butterfly diversity within 18 years after rewetting of montane peatlands in central Germany. We compared diversity and species composition of 19 restored sites with three drained peatlands and one near-natural reference site. Restoration resulted in improved habitat conditions and benefited species diversity, but there were marked differences among taxonomic groups. Dragonflies rapidly colonized small water bodies but their diversity did not further increase in older restoration sites. Characteristic peatland vegetation recovered slowly, since it depended on a high water holding capacity that was only reached after peat started accumulating. Generally, plant diversity developed toward reference conditions albeit incompletely, even 18 years after restoration. Butterflies responded less to peatland restoration; generalists increased only temporarily and specialists could not establish. In conclusion, peatland restoration improves habitat conditions and biodiversity, while trajectories of recovery are nonlinear and incomplete after two decades. This highlights the need for long-term monitoring and a strategic selection of indicator species for evaluation of restoration success.

AB The interference between vascular plants and peat mosses with respect to nitrogen and phosphorus was studied in a fertilization experiment and with respect to competition for light in a removal experiment in poor fens with either soligenous or topogenous hydrology using Narthecium ossifragum (L.) Huds. and three species of Sphagnum sect. Sphagnum as targets. Adding fertilizer either on the moss surface or below it confirmed the hypotheses of an asymmetric competition for nutrients, viz. that the Sphagnum mosses relied on the atmospheric supply while Narthecium depended on mineralization in the peat. The results of the removal experiments and the negatively correlated growth of Narthecium and Sphagnum mosses demonstrated a symmetric competition for light. The intensity of the competition for light increased as the availability of N and P increased. The nutrient resources in the total biomass decreased with decreasing standing crop of Narthecium. Only with a considerable amount of mineral nutrients in the biomass has Narthecium the capacity to grow ahead of Sphagnum, because the asymmetric competition for N and P gives Sphagnum the capacity to reduce the performance of vascular plants. The mosses are more efficient in their use of nutrients and produce a decay-resistant litter inducing low mineralization and increasing the peat accumulation rate, and that withdraws N and P from the rhizosphere. The Sphagnum mosses thus act as ecological engineers structuring the plant community and determining the carbon balance of the system. The development of ombrotrophic conditions through peat accumulation seems less probable on soligenous than on topogenous mires owing to the higher mineralization rate there supporting the growth of the vascular plants. Correspondingly, disturbances of the Sphagnum cover, such as through airborne pollutants, increase the productivity of the vascular plants and decrease the capacity for carbon accumulation.

DE BOUNDARIES; COMMUNITIES; DUNES; FLOODING; SLACKS
AB 1. A re-examination of the distribution of the dominant species in a series of dune and slack communities after an interval of 24 years revealed varying amounts of movement in the boundaries between the different vegetation types.
   2. Some boundaries showed no measurable differences in location while others had changed significantly. The most stable boundary was between the Carex arenaria heath vegetation of the dune tops and the Filipendula ulmaria-dominated community of the adjacent dune slack. This boundary coincided with the maximum winter flood-line which has remained stable despite increased flooding, as excess water decants into drier slacks to seaward.
   3. Within the slack community increased flooding and nutrient supply, from a drainage system that was put in place shortly after the initial survey, have been accompanied by an increase in Glyceria maxima at the expense of F. ulmaria and Carex nigra dominated zones.
   4. Examination of the anoxia tolerance of some of the species suggests that the stable winter flood-line boundary between the dune and slack communities is maintained in its fixed position by the intolerance to anoxia of the dune-top species, with stress tolerance rather than competition being the over-riding factor determining its location. By contrast, changes within the mire vegetation types appear to be in response to competition processes with stress tolerance playing a reduced role.

AB Peatlands are important reserves of terrestrial carbon and biodiversity, and given that many peatlands across the UK and Europe exist in a degraded state, their conservation is a major area of concern and a focus of considerable research. Aerial surveys are valuable tools for habitat mapping and conservation and provide useful insights into their condition. We investigate how SfM photogrammetry-derived topography and habitat classes may be used to construct an estimate of carbon loss from erosion features in a remote blanket bog habitat. An autonomous, unmanned, aerial, fixed-wing remote sensing platform (Quest UAV 300 (TM)) collected imagery over Moor House, in the Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve, a site with a high degree of peatland erosion. The images were used to generate point clouds into orthomosaics and digital surface models using SfM photogrammetry techniques, georeferenced and subsequently used to classify vegetation and peatland features. A classification of peatbog feature types was developed using a random forest classification model trained on field survey data and applied to UAV-captured products including the orthomosaic, digital surface model and derived surfaces such as topographic index, slope and aspect maps. Using the area classified as eroded peat and the derived digital surface model, we estimated a loss of 438 tonnes of carbon from a single gully. The UAV system was relatively straightforward to deploy in such a remote and unimproved area. SfM photogrammetry, imagery and random forest modelling obtained classification accuracies of between 42% and 100%, and was able to discern between bare peat, saturated bog and sphagnum habitats. This paper shows what can be achieved with low-cost UAVs equipped with consumer grade camera equipment and relatively straightforward ground control, and demonstrates their potential for the carbon and peatland conservation research community.

AB We quantified the role of spatially varying vegetation composition in seasonal and interannual changes in a boreal bog's CO2 uptake. We divided the spatially heterogeneous site into six microform classes based on plant species composition and measured their net ecosystem exchange (NEE) using chamber method over the growing seasons in 2012-2014. A nonlinear mixed-effects model was applied to assess how the contributions of microforms with different vegetation change temporally, and to upscale NEE to the ecosystem level to be compared with eddy covariance (EC) measurements. Both ecosystem respiration (R) and gross photosynthesis (P-G) were the largest in high hummocks, 894-964 (R) and 969-1132 (P-G) g CO2 m(-2) growing season(-1), and decreased toward the wetter microforms. NEE had a different spatial pattern than R and P-G; the highest cumulative seasonal CO2 sink was found in lawns in all years (165-353 g CO2 m(-2)). Microforms with similar wetness but distinct vegetation had different NEE, highlighting the importance of vegetation composition in regulating CO2 sink. Chamber-based ecosystem-level NEE was smaller and varied less interannually than the EC-derived estimate, indicating a need for further research on the error sources of both methods. Lawns contributed more to ecosystem-level NEE (55-78%) than their areal cover within the site (21.5%). In spring and autumn, lawns had the highest NEE, whereas in midsummer differences among microforms were small. The contributions of all microforms to the ecosystem-level NEE varied seasonally and interannually, suggesting that spatially heterogeneous vegetation composition could make bog CO2 uptake temporally more stable.

AB This study investigated patterns and controls of the seasonal and inter-annual variations in energy fluxes (i.e., sensible heat, H, and latent heat, lambda E) and partitioning of the water budget (i.e., precipitation, P; evapotranspiration, ET; discharge, Q; and soil water storage, Delta S) over five years (2001-2005) in a boreal oligotrophic fen in northern Sweden based on continuous eddy covariance, water table level (WTL), and weir measurements. For the growing season (May 1 to September 31), the 5 year averages (+/- standard deviation) of the midday (10:00 to 14:00 h) Bowen ratio (beta, i.e., H/lambda E) was 0.86 +/- 0.08. Seasonal and inter-annual variability of beta was mainly driven by lambda E which itself was strongly controlled by both weather (i.e., vapor pressure deficit, D, and net radiation, R-n) and physiological parameters (i.e., surface resistance). During the growing season, surface resistance largely exceeded aerodynamic resistance, which together with low mean values of the actual ET to potential ET ratio (0.55 +/- 0.05) and Priestley-Taylor alpha (0.89) suggests significant physiological constrains on ET in this well-watered fen. Among the water budget components, the inter-annual variability of ET was lower (199 to 298 mm) compared to Q (225 to 752 mm), with each accounting on average for 34 and 65% of the ecosystem water loss, respectively. The fraction of P expended into ET was negatively correlated to P and positively to R-n. Although a decrease in WTL caused a reduction of the surface conductance, the overall effect of WTL on ET was limited. Non-growing season (October 1 to April 30) fluxes of H, lambda E, and Q were significant representing on average -67%, 13%, and 61%, respectively, of their growing season sums (negative sign indicates opposite flux direction between the two seasons). Overall, our findings suggest that plant functional type composition, P and R-n dynamics (i.e., amount and timing) were the major controls on the partitioning of the mire energy and water budgets. This has important implications for the regional climate as well as for ecosystem development, nutrient, and carbon dynamics. Citation: Peichl, M., J. Sagerfors, A. Lindroth, I. Buffam, A. Grelle, L.

AB A chronosequence of restiad peat bogs (dominated by Restionaceae) in the lowland warm temperate zone of the Waikato region, North Island, New Zealand, was sampled to identify the major environmental determinants of vegetation pattern and dynamics. Agglomerative hierarchical classification of vegetation data from 69 plots in nine different-aged bogs, initiated from c. 600 to c. 15,000 cal yr BP, identified eight groups. Six of these groups formed a sequence from sedges through Empodisma minus, the main peat-forming restiad species, to phases dominated by a second restiad species, Sporadanthus ferrugineus. The sequence reflected bog age and paralleled patterns of temporal succession over the last 15,000 years (from early successional sedges through mid-successional Empodisma to late successional Sporadanthus) derived from previous studies of plant macrofossils and microfossils in peat cores. This indicated that different-aged bogs in the Waikato region could be used to interpret temporal succession. The remaining two classificatory groups comprised plots from sites modified by drainage, fire, or weed invasion and currently dominated by non-restiad species. The relationships between environmental variables and the six groups representing restiad bog succession indicated that, as succession proceeds, von Post decomposition index and nutrients in the top 7.5 cm peat zone decrease. The most useful indicators of successional stage were von Post, total P, total N, and % ash. Environmental response curves of the dominant plant species separated the species along nutrient and peat decompositional gradients, with early successional species having wider potential environmental ranges than late successional species. Empodisma minus, a mid-successional species, also had a relatively wide environmental range, which probably contributes to its key role in restiad bog development.

AB This study examines the recovery of the microbial compartment following active restoration of a North American ombrotrophic peatland extracted for horticultural peat-based substrates and restored by the Sphagnum moss transfer method. We used phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) to portrait the microbial community structure and Community Level Physiological Profiles (CLPP) to describe the functional diversity of the microbial communities. Our results indicate that the PLFA profiles were different between the beginning and the end of the growing season, but that it was impossible to distinguish five different vegetation classes found along the disturbance-recovery gradient on the basis of the microbial community structure. The pH, the cover of mosses, Ledum groenlandicum and Erlophorum vaginatum var. spissum were the best environmental predictors for the PLFA composition. The newly formed peat found in aerobic conditions beneath restored Sphagnum carpets had the highest decomposition capacity, whereas the lowest rates were found in the surface samples of non-restored conditions or in the deepest horizons of the natural samples. A large proportion of the variation in the physiological profiles was explained with variables related to the vegetation cover, the physicochemical environment and the microbial structure of the community, which is very promising for future monitoring studies. Overall, this study demonstrates that the recovery of particular plant groups, namely mosses and shrubs in restored peatlands might be the driver of changes occurring in the structure of the microbial communities in restored peatlands.

AB Studies of plant species richness have often emphasized the role of either community biomass (as an indicator of density effects) or abiotic factors. In this article we present a general model that simultaneously examines the relative importance of abiotic and density effects. General and specific models were developed to examine the importance of abiotic conditions, disturbance, and community biomass on plant species richness. Models were evaluated using structural equation modeling based on data from 190 plots across a coastal marsh landscape. The accepted model was found to explain 45% of the observed variation in richness, 75% of biomass, and 65% of light penetration. Model results indicate that abiotic conditions have both direct effects on the species pool and indirect effects on richness mediated through effects on biomass and shading. Effects of disturbance were found to be indirect via biomass. Strong density effects on richness were indicated by the results, and canopy light penetration was found to be a better predictor of richness than was biomass. Overall, it appears that richness in this coastal landscape is controlled in roughly equal proportions by abiotic influences on the species pool and density effects, with disturbance playing a lesser role. The structure of the general model presented should be applicable to a wide variety of herbaceous plant communities.

AB Upland peatlands in the UK are important sources of palaeoenvironmental information, providing context to human land use in upland areas. Land management practices, particularly over the last 150 years have resulted in damage to the integrity of this palaeoenvironmental record. This study focuses on the effects of drainage on the condition of pollen remains within upland peat deposits using a case study from Exmoor, southwest England. Water-table monitoring and coring across three mires enabled the effects of water-table draw-down on the condition of pollen remains within the peat matrix to be assessed. Our results show that peatland drainage, which has taken place over the last 60-150 years, caused significant localised water-table draw-down. A detailed pollen condition survey across seven coring sites demonstrates that pollen within the peat is damaged as a consequence. However, pollen is rarely so damaged that counted pollen assemblages are unreliable. Correspondence between pollen condition and past climate shifts and periods of enhanced human activity, suggests that recent damage to pollen caused by peatland drainage is superimposed on damage caused by other factors throughout the period of peat accumulation.

AB High-mountain lakes are suitable ecosystems for studying local environmental shifts driven by large-scale climate changes, with potential applications to predict future scenarios. The precise features in the response of species assemblages are not fully understood, and human pressure may often hide climatic signals. To investigate the origin and impact of past environmental changes in high-mountain ecosystems and apply this palaeoecological knowledge to anticipate future changes, we performed a multi-proxy study of a sediment core from Bassa Nera, a pond located close to montane-subalpine ecotone in the southern central Pyrenees. Combining pollen and diatom analysis at multidecadal resolution, we inferred vegetation shifts and peat bog development during the past millennium. We introduced a montane pollen ratio as a new palaeoecological indicator of altitudinal shifts in vegetation. Our results emphasize the sensitivity of the montane ratio to detect upward migrations of deciduous forest and the presence of the montane belt close to Bassa Nera pond during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Changes in aquatic taxa allowed to date the onset of the surrounding peat bog which appeared and infilled the coring site around AD 1565. Overall, our results suggest a low-intensity human pressure and changes in management of natural resources during the last millennium, where farming was the main activity from the Medieval Climate Anomaly until AD 1500. Afterwards, people turned to highland livestock raising coinciding with the Little Ice Age'.

AB The aim of this paper was to utilize Ellenberg's plant indicator system for assessing mollusc autecology and to highlight possibilities and advantages of that approach in the case of fen mollusc communities. Molluscs and plants from 137 fen sites in the Western Carpathian Mountains were recorded quantitatively from homogeneous areas of 16 m(2). Water conductivity and pH were measured in the field. Values of Ellenberg's "light, temperature, contmentality, moisture, soil reaction, and nutrients" were estimated for each site. The whole data set was processed using ordinations (PCA, DCA, and CCA) and generalized additive models (GAMs). We observed a strong correlation between water pH and Ellenberg soil reaction estimated by plant indicator values (r = 0.72, P < 0.001). Ellenberg soil reaction was found to be the best predictor of mollusc species composition, which expressed the main mineral- richness gradient. We found the existence of a second important gradient, the gradient of "light", expressing site and canopy openness. A tight correspondence between the results of species response curve modelling based on water conductivity and Ellenberg soil reaction confirmed that "soil reaction" does not express merely pH, but rather the total amount of calcium. We conclude that the Elleriberg's indicator system can be used to study the ecology of land molluscs, an important group of invertebrates in bioindication and nature conservation. our data and approach could help design appropriate conservation management regimes for threatened snail species. We propose that our approach will be useful also in ecological studies of other animal groups.

AB Projected changes in climate could shift northern peatlands from their current status as net C sinks toward that of being net C sources by changing soil temperatures and hydrology. We assessed the importance of water table and soil temperature as controls over ecosystem respiration in a bog and sedge fen in northern Minnesota, USA, by means of a manipulative mesocosm experiment. Fifty-four intact monoliths were removed from a bog and a fen and installed in insulated tanks that permitted control of the water table and were heated by overhead infrared heaters. The experimental design was a fully crossed factorial combination of two communities, three water tables, and three heat levels. Fcosystem respiration as indicated by emission of CO2 and CH4, dissolved nutrient fluxes, and productivity were measured and summarized for each growing season from 1995 to 1997.
   Seasonal ecosystem respiration (ER) as indicated by CO2 emissions responded almost exclusively to soil temperature and did not differ between community types (similar to 630 g C/ m(2)) or with water table level. These results suggest that community type, within certain limits, will not be an important factor in predicting temperature-driven increases in ER.
   The response of CH4 flux to soil temperature and water table setting became progressively stronger in each succeeding growing season. Seasonal CH4 emissions were on average three times higher in the bog than in the fen mesocosms (21 vs. 7 g C/m(2)). Aboveground net primary productivity and dissolved N retention were also higher in the bog mesocosms. There were strong correlations between CH4 flux and N retention, but generally weak correlations between CH4 and plant primary production. The relatively lower CH4 emissions from the fen mesocosms appear to result mainly from higher rates of methanotrophy in the aerated zone, possibly reinforced by the effects of higher porewater N concentrations and lower primary productivity compared to the bogs.
   The results confirm the existence of strong environmental controls over ER and methanogenesis, which are modulated by complex interactions between plant community and soil nutrient dynamics. The differential responses of these ecosystem functions to climate change may complicate efforts to predict future changes in C dynamics in these important repositories of soil C.

AB Net CO, exchange measured under well-mixed atmospheric conditions in four different mires in Sweden and Finland were used to analyse which factors were controlling photosynthesis and respiration. The parameters of a light response function showed strong seasonal variations with similar behaviour for all mires. The half-monthly nighttime respiration rates in the central part of the growing season were about two times higher in the southernmost, warmest site. Faje. as compared to the northernmost, coldest site, Kaamanen. However. Kaamanen had high photosynthesis rates, and this in combination with the long daylight periods in the middle of the summer caused Kaamanen to have the largest net ecosystem exchange (NEE) during the summer period. Faje that showed the highest productivity had also the highest respiration and therefore. the lowest NEE during summer. Correlation between half-monthly components and different environmental variables showed the highest correlation between the components themselves. Thereafter came temperature except for Faje where water table depth (WTD) explained most of the variance both for detrended and temperature-normalized components. All sites showed dependencies between WTD and the respective components during drying up periods. Temperature sensitivity was higher for productivity than for respiration indicating that CO uptake would increase during global warming.

AB Black Ridge Brook is an upland peat site in a high rainfall area of SW England. Pollen evidence has shown that it was once wooded, with Betula and Corylus dominant, before periods of change to more open ground and the spread of mire vegetation. Previous palaeoecological work at the site inferred a history of burning based on microscopic charcoal levels, with the burning periods reducing Betula cover. These changes occurred between 9000 and 6300 BP (radiocarbon years) during the Mesolithic archaeological period, and have been linked to the impacts of hunter-gatherers using fire, as suggested elsewhere in upland Britain.
   In this paper, hypotheses of deliberate burning, grazing and the reasons for using fire are tested using non-pollen palynomorphs in addition to the microcharcoal and pollen data. While indicators of dung are present, the frequencies are low, and not always in the levels expected on the basis of vegetation change, although some correlation of disturbance indicators is seen in the earlier Holocene before woodland cover reached a maximum. There is evidence for increased and sustained growth of Corylus following increases in inferred fire frequency. Statistical analysis of the combined data set shows the association of some non-pollen types with specific stages in the development, and then recession, of woodland. Other types show the presence of on-site burning or host plants, and help distinguish between local and regional vegetation changes. The nature of the depositional environment is both shown by, but also affects, the non-pollen microfossil record. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peat cores were taken from eight primary and one secondary raised bog sites throughout the United Kingdom in order to determine the pathways of succession between the microform (hummock, ridge, lawn, hollow, and pool) plant communities of the mid to late Holocene. All of these sites have undergone drainage and/or cutting in the recent past, at least. The plant communities were reconstructed by using plant macrofossil analysis, and they are defined primarily by the dominant species of Sphagnum. While plant macrofossils may be used to infer hydrological conditions, an alternative proxy, using testate amoebae, was utilized. This group of organisms was used to avoid circular arguments when relating the vegetation changes to hydrological events. Consequently, a conceptual model of late Holocene succession on British raised mires is constructed that elucidates succession between the microform plant communities according to changes in the water table depth, its stability, quality, and physical disturbance of the vegetation cover. The general sequence of ombrogenous communities was elucidated to be, with increasing height above the water tables, S. cuspidatum and S. auriculatum > Sphagnum sect. Cymbifolia taxa > Sphagnum sect. Acutifolia taxa > a return of Sphagnum sect. Cymbifolia taxa > non-Sphagnum mosses.
   A major pathway toward degradation of the mire is apparent in modern times, and recovery is typically via a phase of dominance by S. tenellum prior to the establishment of either S. magellanicum or S. papillosum. Although this disturbance is of a large magnitude, it was found that equable or more severe perturbations to the water table had occurred in the past, especially at coastal sites where marine regression led to the establishment of Sphagnum-poor communities dominated by Calluna and Eriophorum vaginatum. The long-term persistence of hummock-hollow vegetation communities is demonstrated, but the appearance of persistent, more homogeneous phases suggests that this surface topography is not always well developed.

AB For centuries European peatlands have been degrading along with drainage, land use and climate changes. Increasing pressure on peatland ecosystems calls for a more cost-efficient method to indicate the current state of peatlands and the success of restoration efforts. Metabolic pathways in peatland soils are imprinted in stable isotope compositions due to differences in microorganism communities and their metabolic pathways. Therefore, we hypothesize that depth profiles of nitrogen stable isotope values provide a promising opportunity to detect peatland decomposition or restoration. We studied five peatlands, namely Degern Stormyr (northern Sweden), Lakkasuo (central Finland) and three mires in the Black Forest (southern Germany). At all locations, cores were taken from adjacent drained (or rewetted) and natural sites to identify delta N-15 trends that could indicate changes due to drainage and restoration. At all drained (and rewetted) sites we found a distinct peak ("turning point") of the delta N-15 values in the center of the drained horizon. We did a fatty acids (FAs) analysis to link our results to microbial community composition. As markers, we distinguished between one fungal-derived FA (C18:2 omega 9c) and four bacterial-derived FAs. For bacteria, we looked for one general bacterial-derived FA (C14:0), two FAs for gram-positive bacteria (i-C15:0; a-C15:0), and one FA for gram-negative bacteria (C16:1 omega 9c). In accordance with other studies, our results suggest that fungi dominate the microbial metabolism in the upper aerobic peat horizon. This is reflected by depleted delta N-15 values. Moving downwards, the drained horizon conditions slowly switch to oxygen limitation. Consequently, fungal-derived FAs decrease whereas bacterial-derived FAs rise. The highest diversity of microbial-derived FAs is indicated by the delta N-15 turning point. Below the delta N-15 turning point, oxygen is increasingly limited and concentrations of all microbial-derived FAs are decreasing down to the onset of the permanently waterlogged anaerobic horizon. Peatland cores with restoration successes again show, above the formerly drained horizon, no depth trend of the isotopic values. Hence, we conclude that delta N-15 stable isotope values reflect microbial community composition, which differs between drained and natural peatlands.

AB Peatlands in northern Alberta, Canada, are being rapidly impacted by oil sands activities, with potentially long-term consequences for their recovery. In situ oil sands extraction requires exploration of oil resources on a dense network of drilling pads across the landscape. This study examined the recovery of wooded moderate-rich (WMR) fens 10 years after abandonment of these sites with minimal restorative measures. Bryophyte and vascular plant diversity, site microtopography, and water chemistry were assessed on drilling pads and in adjacent areas of undisturbed reference habitat. WMR fens affected by drilling activities were divided a priori into two groups based on strongly divergent trends in their successional development. One group represented the majority of WMR fens observed on the land base; at these sites hummock-forming mosses including minerotrophic Sphagnum species were infrequent and tree recruitment was almost absent. The other group was dominated by Sphagnum species, had Picea mariana and Larix laricina recruitment, and appeared to recover more quickly. Both groups had high abundance of wetland sedges, notably Carex aquatilis. Further, drilling pads belonging to the first group had a high water table, limited elevated microsites, and had surface flooding over a portion of the growing season, in contrast to Sphagnum-dominated sites. Development of the aquatic, bryophyte-poor wetland type is comparable to early stages of wetland succession and these systems will recover relatively slowly, likely from decades to more than a century. Restoring part of the vertical distribution of micro-habitats before abandonment of these pads could stimulate the successional recovery of vegetation.

It is shown that the contemporary warming does not interrupt the bog formation, which is due to the lateral flooding by water came from adjoining peatlands and periodical waterlogging of floodplain depressions during the years of excessive water supply.

AB The effect of climate change on peatlands is of great importance due to their large carbon stocks. In this study, we examined microbial biomass and effect of temperature and O-2 availability on soil respiration of surface and subsurface Sphagnum peat. The interactive effect of biotic and abiotic factors significantly affects soil respiration. Increasing temperature enhanced the microbial respiratory activity and thus the soil respiration, while there is a temperature threshold. The more decomposed subsurface peat showed a lower CO2 production due to less labile carbon and lower microbial biomass, but a higher temperature sensitivity. Q(10) of aerobic respiration increased from 1.93 +/- 0.26 in surface to 2.20 +/- 0.01 in subsurface peat. The linear relationship between Q(10) and depth in the uppermost 50 cm peat section can be used to improve the estimation of CO2 production in peat profiles.

AB Background and aimsMicrobial communities are the primary drivers of organic matter decomposition in peatlands. However, limited knowledge is available regarding depth-dependent microbial community structure and function in East Asian peatlands, using cultivation independent approaches.MethodsWe investigated the vertical stratification of prokaryote and fungal communities in a moderately rich fen in northeast China (Hani) and a rich fen in southwest China (Riganqiao).ResultsFungal and prokaryotic operational taxonomic unit (OTU) composition exhibited strong site and/or depth responses. Prokaryotic OTUs exhibited the greatest alpha diversity at the mesotelm hot spot', whereas the predicted metagenomic metabolic functions did not align with the pattern of prokaryote alpha diversity. The large cover of shrubs contributed to a greater relative abundance of ericoid- and ecto-mycorrhizal fungi at Hani, whereas Riganqiao showed more arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Soil pH and water table depth were among the predominant abiotic factors associated with microbial community composition.ConclusionsProjected shifts in hydrology and/or vegetation with global change may cause substantial impacts on peatland microorganisms and thus the associated biogeochemistry. It is critical to better understand the mechanism of the discrepancy between microbial community structure and the functions at the mesotelm hot spot' when evaluating the ecosystem functions in peatlands.

AB We reconstruct palaeoenvironmental changes since the Late Holocene in the Orava-Nowy Targ Basin, with an emphasis on anthropogenic influence (Walker et al., 2018). This reconstruction employs multiproxy analyses of the Otrebowskie Brzegi poor fen. We combined radiocarbon and Pb-210 dating with elemental geochemistry, stable lead isotopes, and palaeobotanical analyses. The core we investigated covers a period from 4200 +/- 100 BC to the present, with a peat accumulation rate varying between 0.001 and 0.243 cm y(-1). Heavy metal concentrations, Pb isotopic ratios, and a palynological analysis revealed a significant impact of human activities in the past. The highest concentration and accumulation rate of Pb, were found around 1950 AD. The Pb-206/Pb-207 quotient ranged between 1.168 and 1.223, with average value around 1.198. Most of the interpretation was based on Pb and its stable isotopes; however, other elements were also important indicators of natural and anthropogenic environmental changes. Our results revealed similarities between the geochemical composition of the peatland studied and other peatlands from the Orava-Nowy Targ Basin.

AB We examined how different landscape areas in a catchment containing a northern ombrotrophic peatland and upland mineral soils responded to dramatic decreases in atmospheric deposition of lead (Pb). Pb concentrations in the outflow stream from the peatland measured from 2009-2015 indicated continued mobilization and export of Pb derived from historic inputs to the bog. In contrast, Pb concentrations in surface peat and runoff from upland mineral soils have declined in response to reductions in atmospheric deposition. Relative to the early 1980s, Pb concentrations in the streamflow decreased only 50%, while Pb in surface peat and upland subsurface runoff decreased by more than 90%. Water level fluctuations in the slow accumulating peat have allowed dissolved organic matter (DOM) to continue mobilizing Pb deposited in the peatland decades earlier. Strong correlations between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and Pb concentrations in outflow from the peatland and in bog porewaters demonstrate Pb mobility related to DOM production. Peat stores of Pb in 2016 were less than or equal to those reported in the early 1980s despite the dry mass inventory increasing by 60-80%. Much of the loss in Pb stored in peat can be accounted for by stream runoff from the peatland.

AB 1. Peatlands are valued for ecosystem services including carbon storage, water provision and biodiversity. However, there are concerns about the impacts of land management and pollution on peatland vegetation and function.
   2. We investigated how prescribed vegetation burning, atmospheric pollution and grazing are related to vegetation communities and cover of four key taxa ( Sphagnum spp., Calluna vulgaris, Eriophorum vaginatum and Campylopus introflexus) using two datasets from a total of 2,013 plots across 95 peatland sites in the UK.
   3. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutational multivariate analysis of variance showed differences in vegetation community composition between burned and unburned plots at regional and national scales.
   4. Analysis showed that burned sites had less Sphagnum and greater C. vulgaris cover on a national scale. On a regional scale, plots burned between 2 and 10 years ago had greater cover of invasive moss C. introflexus and less E. vaginatum than unburned sites.
   5. Livestock presence was associated with less Sphagnum and C. vulgaris, while atmospheric pollution was associated with less Sphagnum, but greater C. introflexus cover, and appeared to have more impact on burned sites.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Burning, grazing and atmospheric pollution are associated with peatland vegetation composition and cover of key species, including Sphagnum. We suggest that, to promote cover of peat-forming species, peatlands should not be routinely burned or heavily grazed. Current or historical atmospheric pollution may hinder peat-forming species, particularly on burned sites.

AB The study central goal was to analyze secondary succession in a degraded peatland: (1) Sphagnum distribution trends and (2) successional patterns. Main study sites were adjacent abandoned pastures, where grazing was carried out in former peatland and where degradation had occurred, hereafter referred as degraded peatland. (1) Degraded peatland was mapped in 2006 (while it was still a pasture, grazed for over 30 years), and throughout the study period in 2013 (2 years post-abandonment) and 2015 (4 years post-abandonment). The baseline assessment of 2006 revealed that Sphagnum spp. were present in 7% of the area, which pointed at the resilience of the peat ecosystem. After the grazing ceased, Sphagnum cover increased to 17% and 39%, in the next 2 and 4 years respectively post animal removal. (2) To gain a general comprehension of flora and vegetation changes along the regenerative sucession, 48 permanent plots were established in the degraded peatland. In two other study sites, a further twenty plots were established, ten plots in a semi-natural peatland area where grazing ceased 30 years ago and ten others in a natural peatland. These were monitored between July 2012 and July 2015 (triannual). After 4 years, the formerly degraded peatland showed considerable recovery with a growth of Sphagnum spp. cover as well as other species like Calluna vulgaris, tending to become more similar to semi-natural and natural peatlands. Grazing cessation induced the regenerative succession that could lead to self-recovery, which, in optimal conditions, could be an alternative to active restoration in Azores.

AB Grazing is a possible tool for conservation management in wetlands, but a frequent problem is spatial variation in grazing intensity, which may promote the degradation of the vegetation. Temporal changes in grazing patterns may reduce this problem by leading to a more homogeneous overall use of the area. In a lakeshore wetland (2.8 ha) grazed by Scottish Highland cattle from May till September, we studied how the grazing of nine vegetation types changes seasonally and between years, and how this is related to the quantity and quality of the herbage. We observed cattle activity weekly throughout two grazing periods, determined the biomass and nutrient concentrations of the vegetation, analysed dung samples, and carried out clipping experiments to assess shoot regeneration after grazing. The annual grazing intensity varied seven-fold among vegetation types, and this pattern was closely similar in both years. In several vegetation types, however, grazing intensity changed seasonally. Cattle first grazed tall grass-dominated vegetation (Phragmition, Phalaridion), which had the most digestible and nutrient-rich herbage, but the poor regeneration of dominant species forced the cattle to then graze small-sedge dominated, nutrient-poor fen vegetation (Caricion davallianae). These temporal changes in grazing patterns slightly reduced the spatial variation in grazing intensity. To take advantage of this effect, relatively long grazing seasons are preferable to shorter ones. Four years of grazing reduced the above-ground biomass production and nutrient concentrations of several vegetation types. Therefore, years without grazing may be needed to prevent a degradation of palatable plant communities with low grazing tolerance.

AB Within the framework of the European LAPP-project (Land Arctic Physical Processes) and as part of the Danish Research Council's Polar Programme, studies on water and surface energy balance in NE Greenland were conducted in 1996 and 1997. Eddy correlation measurements of water vapour and sensible heat fluxes above the three dominant vegetation types: fen, willow snowbed, and heath were conducted for the entire growing season. This was supplemented by measurements of evaporation from snow covered areas and from a small pond. The evapotranspiration was found to be relatively high with the maximum from the fen (approximate to 86 per season). For the two other vegetation types the evapotranspiration was less, for heath 61 mm per season, while willow snowbed had evaporation rates on intermediate level. By use of the Penman-Monteith equation it was possible to estimate the altitude dependence of the evapotranspiration and calculate the annual evaporation for the whole area to 80 mm per year. By applying a bucket model the evaporation was found to be in accordance with changes in soil moisture as monitored with TDR.
   The observed surface water balance was compared to river discharge, which shows a glacio-nival regime with an early spring flow (June), determined by the snow melt in the main valley and an July-August maximum determined by melt on higher plateau areas. When balancing the individual hydrological components an annual deficit of 180 mm was observed, but it was found that this deficit could be reduced by correcting for aerodynamic and altitude effects on the precipitation. Finally some of the possible consequences of a global warming is discussed in relation to the water and energy balance in the high-arctic ecosystem.

AB Globally, peatlands are under threat from a range of land use related factors that have a significant impact on the provision of ecosystem services, such as biodiversity and carbon (C) sequestration/storage. In Ireland, approximately 84% of raised bogs (a priority habitat listed in Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive) have been affected by peat extraction. While restoration implies the return of ecosystem services that were characteristic of the pre-disturbed ecosystem, achieving this goal is often a challenge in degraded peatlands as post-drainage conditions vary considerably between sites. Here, we present multi-year greenhouse gas (GHG) and vegetation dynamics data from two former raised bogs in Ireland that were drained and either industrially extracted (milled) or cut on the margins for domestic use and subsequently rewetted (with no further management). When upscaled to the ecosystem level, the rewetted nutrient poor domestic cutover peatland was a net sink of carbon dioxide (CO2) (-49 +/- 66 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) and a source of methane (CH4) (19.7 +/- 5 g Cm-2 yr(-1)), while the nutrient rich industrial cutaway was a net source of CO2 (0.66 +/- 168 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) and CH4 (5.0 +/- 2.2 g Cm-2 yr(-1)). The rewetted domestic cutover site exhibited the expected range of micro-habitats and species composition found in natural (non-degraded) counterparts. In contrast, despite successful rewetting, the industrially extracted peatland did not exhibit typical raised bog flora. This study demonstrated that environmental and management variables can influence species composition and, therefore, the regeneration of species typical of natural sites, and has highlighted the climate benefits from rewetting degraded peatlands in terms of reduced GHG emissions. However, rewetting of degraded peatlands is a major challenge and in some cases reintroduction of bryophytes typical of natural raised bogs may be more difficult than the achievement of proper GHG emission savings.

AB If peatland is left without any restoration treatments after mechanical peat extraction ceases, the process of secondary transformation of peat continues. The resulting changes in peat properties severely impede the recovery of vegetation on cutover peatland. The aim of this study was to assess how secondary transformation of peat affects spontaneous revegetation, and the relative importance of different factors in controlling the reestablishment of raised bog species on previously cutover peat surfaces. The study was conducted on two sectors of a raised bog in southern Poland where peat extraction ended either 20 or 30 years ago. Where the residual peat layer was thin (similar to 40 cm or less) and the water table often dropped into the mineral substratum, the development of vascular plants (including trees) was favoured, and this further promoted the secondary transformation of peat. In such locations the vegetation tended towards a pine and birch community. Revegetation by Sphagnum and other raised bog species (Eriophorum vaginatum, Vaccinium uliginosum, Ledum palustre, Oxycoccus palustris) was associated with thicker residual peat and higher water table level which, in turn, were strongly correlated with hydrophysical properties of the soil. A species - environmental factor redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that any single factor (of those considered) was not important in determining the revegetation pattern, because of their intercorrelations. However, water table level appeared to be the most important abiotic factor in determining the degree of soil aeration and, consequently, the stage of secondary transformation attained by the peat.

AB We studied the restoration success of a cut-away peatland 10 years after restoration by comparing the vegetation and CO2 dynamics with those of a pristine peatland of similar nutrition level and climate. Vegetation and CO2 dynamics were monitored during one growing season. We used DCA (detrended correspondence analysis) and diversity indices to study the vegetation composition within and between the sites, and non-linear regression models to estimate the seasonal CO2 fluxes and balances of the sites. Based on both DCA and diversity indices, the study plots in the restored site differed more in the vegetation composition than the study plots in the pristine site. The variation in the CO2 fluxes and balance was greater in the restored than in the pristine site, resulting from the heterogeneous vegetation in the restored site. The seasonal net CO2 balance was positive (sink) at both sites, the restored site binding on average 500 +/- 410 g CO2/m2 and the pristine site 390 +/- 265 g CO2/m2 (statistically not different, p = 0.575). The results indicate that the restoration of the vegetation composition is still incomplete but the vegetation coverage is sufficient for the restored site to function as a sink of atmospheric CO2.

AB Questions Climate warming has been demonstrated to shift peatland plant community composition fromSphagnummosses to vascular plants inSphagnum-dominated peatlands. However, fewer studies have determined how increasing temperature affects vegetation patterns inCarex-dominated peatlands. As plants are important determinants of carbon storage potential in peatlands, we aim to determine how climate warming alters plant community composition in peatlands of two different vegetation types. Location Boreal peatlands in north-central Ontario, Canada. Methods In aSphagnum- and aCarex-dominated peatland over two growing seasons, we instigated passive warming using clear open-topped chambers, providing a modest increase (1-2 degrees C) in temperature. In replicated plots we examined shifts in plant community composition using the point intercept method, and total above-ground biomass using Leaf Area Index (LAI) against non-warmed control plots. Results While there was no difference in species diversity between control and warmed plots in either fen site, warming significantly increased above-ground biomass in theCarex-dominated fen and decreased moss abundance in theSphagnum-dominated fen. Both fens also displayed significantly different plant community composition between warming and control plots, and increased heterogeneity under warming. Conclusion Peatlands are important global carbon stores and the plant community contributes to their carbon storage;Sphagnummosses, in particular, are linked to high peatland carbon storage potential. Previous studies inSphagnum-dominated peatlands have shown concomitant declines inSphagnumbiomass and increases in vascular plant biomass, and in the short term, we show only a decline inSphagnum. At both sites the increase in plant community heterogeneity suggests that climate warming effects on plant community composition in boreal peatlands may be more unpredictable than the literature suggests. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that plant community shifts occur even under modest warming scenarios.

AB Large areas of upland mire and moorland in Northwest Europe are regarded as degraded, not actively peat-forming, and releasing carbon. Conservation agencies have short-term targets to restore such areas, but often have no clear knowledge of the timing and nature of degradation. It has been suggested that palaeoecology can be used to inform conservation management about past vegetation states, so as to help identify feasible restoration targets. Our research study in northern England, commissioned by the national statutory conservation agency, applied multiple palaeoecological techniques to establish the vegetation history of several mire and moorland sites, specifically to ascertain the nature and timing of degradation. Techniques applied included pollen analysis, plant macrofossil and charcoal analyses, determination of peat humification and mineral magnetic susceptibility, with ages ascertained using spheroidal carbonaceous particle analysis, Pb-210 and C-14 dating. Data are presented from case-study sites in the North York Moors, North-and South Pennines to illustrate how palaeoecology can extend long-term monitoring and guide conservation management. Palaeoecological data from a site within a National Nature Reserve, subject to exceptionally long-term (half-centennial) ecological monitoring, showed that this period does not include its pre-degradation state and that its current valued vegetation is novel and may have established after major fire. Overall, the studies suggest that the principal vegetation change at the sites took place after the start of the Industrial Revolution, and that the current landscape appearance not only has no long history, but that valued aspects, such as extensive heather moorland, feature only recently in the cultural landscape. These findings pose challenging questions for conservation management. We offer a non-specialist guide to the palaeoecological techniques that considers level of skill, cost, and comparability with ecological aspects of conservation and monitoring interest. We suggest palaeoecological data can provide valuable information and insights to aid practical conservation. While mires are particularly suitable, palaeoecological techniques could be applied in many other degraded landscapes internationally.

AB Over the last century, the vast majority of peatlands in Europe have experienced substantial transformation as a result of drainage works that led to an imbalance in the natural hydrologic regime as well as changes in vegetation composition. The ongoing study aims to reconstruct the natural hydrologic regime of peatlands and restore their typical vegetation communities. In this study, we examine the variability of groundwater levels and groundwater temperature in raised bogs located in the Bieszczady Mts. in southern Poland. Both groundwater table levels and groundwater temperature serve to characterise the hydrology of peatlands, which in turn is critical for plant growth and rates of relevant biochemical processes. Our objective is to determine the predominant scale of intra-annual variability in time series and identify their potential sources by assessing the adaptive response of peat bogs to key changes in weather conditions. For this purpose, data obtained from 9 monitoring wells located in peat bogs, with a varying degree of degradation, were used. Fluctuations in time series and potential linkages between selected variables were analysed in the frequency domain using the continuous wavelet transform. The results show that peat bogs exhibit a relatively high stability of groundwater table levels and groundwater temperature despite meaningful changes in weather conditions. The most visible response of peat bogs to weather conditions was observed in summer and autumn. Our study demonstrates that degraded peat bogs experience the largest decrease in groundwater table levels and more frequent fluctuations. In contrast, groundwater temperature remained stable throughout the year at all the studied bog sites. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Large-scale changes in climate may have unexpected effects on ecosystems, given the importance of climate as a control over almost all ecosystem attributes and internal feedbacks. Changes in plant community productivity or composition, for example, may alter ecosystem resource dynamics, trophic structures, or disturbance regimes, with subsequent positive or negative feedbacks on the plant community. At northern latitudes, where increases in temperature are expected to be greatest but where plant species diversity is relatively low, climatically mediated changes in species composition or abundance will likely have large ecosystem effects. In this study, we investigated effects of infrared loading and manipulations of water-table elevation on net primary productivity of plant species in bog and fen wetland mesocosms between 1994 and 1997.
   We removed 27 intact soil monoliths (2.1 m(2) surface area, 0.5-0.7 m depth) each from a bog and a fen in northern Minnesota to construct a large mesocosm facility that allows for direct manipulation of climatic variables in a replicated experimental design. The treatment design was a fully crossed factorial with three infrared-loading treatments, three water-table treatments, and two ecosystem types (bogs and fens), with three replicates of all treatment combinations. Overhead infrared lamps caused mean monthly soil temperatures to increase by 1.6-4.1 degreesC at 15-cm depth during the growing season (May-October). In 1996, depths to water table averaged -11, -19, and -26 cm in the bog plots, and 0, -10, and -19 cm in the fen plots.
   Annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of bryophyte, forb, graminoid, and shrub life-forms was determined for the dominant species in the mesocosm plots based on species specific canopy/biomass relationships. Belowground net primary production (BNPP) was estimated using root in-growth cores.
   Bog and fen communities differed in their response to infrared loading and water-table treatments because of the differential response of life-forms and species characteristic of each community. Along a gradient of increasing water-table elevation, production of bryophytes increased, and production of shrubs decreased in the bog community. Along a similar gradient in the fen community, production of graminoids and forbs increased. Along a gradient of in creasing infrared loading in the bog, shrub production increased whereas graminoid production decreased. In the fen, graminoids were most productive at high infrared loading, and forbs were most productive at medium infrared loading. In the bog and fen, BNPP:ANPP ratios increased with warming and drying, indicating shifts in carbon allocation in response to climate change.
   Further, opposing responses of species and life-forms tended to cancel out the response of production at higher levels of organization, especially in the bog. For example, total net primary productivity in the bog did not differ between water-table treatments because BNPP was greatest in the dry treatment whereas ANPP was greatest in the wet treatment.
   The differential responses of species, life-forms, and above- and belowground biomass production to the treatments suggest that bog and fen plant communities will change, in different directions and magnitudes, in response to warming and changes in water-table elevation. Further, results of this and complementary research indicate that these peatlands may mediate their energy, carbon, and nutrient budgets through differential responses of the plant communities. Thus, predictions of the response of peatlands to changes in climate should consider differences in plant community structure, as well as biogeochemistry and hydrology, that characterize and differentiate these two ecosystems.

AB Research on peatland C cycling has generally ignored refixation, i.e., the photosynthetic fixation of soil-produced or respired CO2. We quantified refixation in a boreal bog by transplanting groups of living nonradioactive Sphagnum fuscum (5 cm length, 4 cm diameter) into N-, P-, and S-fertilized field plots that had been radioactively labeled by exposure to (CO2)-C-14, and analyzing transplants retrieved at 2, 30, and 90 days post-labeling for C-14 activity. Sphagnum transplanted into plots that received both N and S had greater refixed C-14 activities (Bq g(-1)) than control plot transplants. Sphagnum capitulum (top 1 cm), 1-2 cm, and 2-5 cm sections behaved similarly with the capitula having the highest refuted C-14 activity and the 2-5 cm section having the lowest; differences between sections became more accentuated over time. Extrapolated to a m(2) basis, transplanted Sphagnum refixed 3.5-5.4% of the total C-14 initially incorporated into the living vegetation and top 10 cm of peat during labeling. Refixation may be an important pathway for C cycling within peatlands, potentially capturing significant proportions of peat-produced or respired CO2 before it escapes to the atmosphere.

Most solutes exhibited large gradients with depth. pH increased by two units and calcium concentrations increased over 20 fold with depth, and may reflect peatland development from minerotrophic to ombrotrophic conditions. Ammonium concentrations increased almost 20 fold and TOC concentrations decreased by half with depth, and these patterns likely reflect mineralization of peat or decomposition of TOC. There was also considerable temporal variation in the porewater chemistry depth profiles. Ammonium, soluble reactive phosphorus, and potassium showed greater temporal variation in near-surface porewater, while pH, calcium, and TOC varied more at depth. This variation demonstrates that deep peat porewater chemistry is not static. Lastly, temporal variation in solute chemistry depth profiles was greater than spatial variation in several instances, especially in shallow porewaters. Characterizing both temporal and spatial variability is necessary to ensure representative sampling in peatlands, especially when calculating solute pools and fluxes and parameterizing process-based models.

AB Peatlands have been recognized as being an important global C pool and make significant contributions to national C fluxes. In Ireland, they cover a considerable amount of the national land area, but no recent inventory or mapping has been undertaken to quantify the spatial extent of this important resource. This study used a rule-based methodology implemented as a series of hierarchical rules in ArcGIS to estimate the extent of contemporary peatlands in Ireland from soil and land-cover maps dating from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The Derived Irish Peat Map was produced at a pixel resolution of 100 m and shows Ireland's peatland resource to be 0.95 Mha or 13.8% of the national land area. This is comparable to estimates of 13.2% from CORINE land-cover data (1990s), 17.0% from the Peatland Map of Ireland (1970s), and 16.7% from the General Soil Map (1980s). The derived map depicts the spatial extent of three peatland types: raised bog and low- and high-level blanket bog. Ground truthing of the derived map enabled estimates of pixel reliability to be calculated. The derived map has an overall reliability of 75% compared with the reliability of 65% for CORINE, 58% for the Peatland Map of Ireland, and 50% for the General Soil Map. We concluded that the methodology created a value-added soil map product from a number of data sources, all of which were to some degree imperfect. The approach taken could be applied to similar survey problems not related to peatlands.

AB The amount of water in peat soil is one factor affecting its bearing capacity, which is a crucial aspect in planning peatland timber harvesting operations. We studied the influence of weather variables on the variation of drained peatland growing season water conditions, here the ground water table depth (WTD). WTD was manually monitored four times in 2014 and three times in 2015 in 10-30 sample plots located in four drained peatland forests in south-western Finland. For each peatland, precipitation and evapotranspiration were calculated from the records of the nearest Finnish Meteorological Institute field stations covering periods from one day to four weeks preceding the WTD monitoring date. A mixed linear model was constructed to investigate the impact of the weather parameters on WTD. Precipitation of the previous four-week period was the most important explanatory variable. The four-week evapotranspiration amount was interacting with the Julian day showing a greater effect in late summer. Other variables influencing WTD were stand volume within the three-metre radius sample plot and distance from nearest ditch. Our results show the potential of weather parameters, specifically that of the previous four-week precipitation and evapotranspiration, for predicting drained peatland water table depth variation and subsequently, the possibility to develop a more general empirical model to assist planning of harvesting operations on drained peatlands.

AB Our objective was to assess the impacts of water table position and plant functional type on peat structure, plant community composition and aboveground plant production.
   We initiated a full factorial experiment with 2 water table (WT) treatments (high and low) and 3 plant functional groups (PFG: sedge, Ericaceae, sedge and Ericaceae- unmanipulated) in twenty-four 1 m(3) intact peatland mesocosms. We measured vegetation cover, aboveground plant production, and peat subsidence to analyze interactive PFG and WT effects.
   Sphagnum rubellum cover increased under high WT, while Polytrichum cover increased with low WT and in sedge only PFGs. Sphagnum production was greatest with high WT, while vascular plant production was greater in low WT treatments. There was an interactive WT x PFG effect on Ericaceae production. Lowered WT resulted in significant peat surface change and increased subsidence. There were significant PFG and WT effects on net peat accumulation, with the lowest rates of accumulation, high and low WT, in sedge only PFGs.
   The shift in water balance leading to lowered water table position predicted with changing climate could impact plant community composition and production, and would likely result in the subsidence of peat.

AB [1] Northern peatlands contain enormous quantities of organic carbon within a few meters of the atmosphere and play a significant role in the planetary carbon balance. We have developed a new, process-oriented model of the contemporary carbon balance of northern peatlands, the Peatland Carbon Simulator (PCARS). Components of PCARS are (1) vascular and nonvascular plant photosynthesis and respiration, net aboveground and belowground production, and litterfall; (2) aerobic and anaerobic decomposition of peat; (3) production, oxidation, and emission of methane; and (4) dissolved organic carbon loss with drainage water. PCARS has an hourly time step and requires air and soil temperatures, incoming radiation, water table depth, and horizontal drainage as drivers. Simulations predict a complete peatland C balance for one season to several years. A 3-year simulation was conducted for Mer Bleue Bog, near Ottawa, Ontario, and results were compared with multiyear eddy covariance tower CO(2) flux and ancillary measurements from the site. Seasonal patterns and the general magnitude of net ecosystem exchange of CO(2) were similar for PCARS and the tower data, though PCARS was generally biased toward net ecosystem respiration (i.e., carbon loss). Gross photosynthesis rates (calculated directly in PCARS, empirically inferred from tower data) were in good accord, so the discrepancy between model and measurement was likely related to autotrophic and/or heterotrophic respiration. Modeled and measured methane emission rates were quite low. PCARS has been designed to link with the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) land surface model and a global climate model (GCM) to examine climate-peatland carbon feedbacks at regional scales in future analyses.

AB Bog peat soils have been accumulating at Wellington Plain peatland, Victoria, Australia for the last 3300 years. Now, dried peat soils are common adjacent to bog peats. The 14C basal age of dried peat is not different from the 14C basal age of bog peat, which supports the theory that dried peat formed from bog peat. A novel application of 210Pb dating links the timing of this change with the introduction of livestock to Wellington Plain in the mid-1800s. Physical loss of material appears to have been the dominant process removing material as bog peats drained to form dried peats, as indicated by the mass balances of carbon and lead. This research has implications for the post-fire and post-grazing restoration of bogs in Victoria's Alpine National Park, and the contribution of peat soils to Australia's carbon emissions.

AB The floristic diversity and vegetation communities of Leonard Marsh and Harpers Meadow, two peatland complexes of recent origin within the Lake Umbagog National Wildlife Refuge in COOS County. New Hampshire, were investigated, The combined vascular floras of Leonard Marsh and Harpers Meadow consisted of 178 species. 111 of which occurred in both peatlands. The flora included two state-listed species, Eriophorum angustifolium subsp. angustifolium (endangered) and Lisiera cordata (threatened) Abundance and frequency data from 617 quadrats along 35 transects were analyzed by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) and resulted in the recognition of nine vegetation cover types (CT): Thuja occidentalis-Alnus incana CT, the Picea CT, the Nemopanthus mucronatus Alnus incana CT, the Rhododendron canadense-Nemopanthus mucronatus CT, the Rhododendron canadense-Chamaedaplme maedaphne calyculata CT, the Chamaedaphne calyculata-Carex oligosperma CT, the Scheuchzeria palustris-Carex oligosperma CT, the Carex lasiocarpa- Chamaedaphne calyculata CT, and the Dulichium arundinaceum-Potentilla palustris CT. A tenth cover type consisting of aquatic vegetation, the Brasenia schreberi-Potamogeton spp. CT, was recognized based on qualitative field observations. Despite the recent formation of these peatland complexes following the construction of the Errol Dam in 1853, the vegetation composition of Leonard Marsh and Harpers Meadow shares broad similarities with peatlands in New England, the northcentral United States. and adjacent Canada. Leonard Marsh and Harpers Meadow are best classified as oligotrophic to weakly minerotrophic level peatland complexes occupying broad and shallow outwash plains. Historical records, botanical evidence, and patterns in basin topography suggest that terrestrialization and paludification have been critical processes in the post-settlement development of these two large peatland complexes.

AB Despite the many studies about peatland development and carbon dynamics in China, especially for Zoige peatlands on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, few apply modeling as an effective approach to study peatland development. In order to fill up the knowledge gaps of China alpine peatland development and to provide a comparison with previous research, we studied the Zoige peatlands in Holocene with a modeling approach.
   Simulated results were obtained by the Holocene peatland model (HPM). Driving data was reconstructed based on paleoclimate studies. Model calibration and performance index validation were done by comparing the model output with literature data about peat age depth.
   Based on our results, the peat cohort mass mean accumulation rate was 0.45 mm year(-1) (ranging from 0.38 to 0.50 mm year(-1)). The mean C accumulation rate was about 0.026 kg C m(-2) year(-1) (ranging from 0.023 to 0.029 kg C m(-2) year(-1)), with a peak accumulation rate around 7 ka to 6 ka BP during the Holocene. The peat depth was 5.38 m (ranging from 4.6 to 5.99 m). The total peat storage in Zoige was about 1.76 Pg (ranging from 1.58 to 2.29 pg), and the carbon stock was estimated as 0.432 pg C (ranging from 0.348 to 0.479 pg C) in Zoige peatlands during the Holocene. After model calibration and validation, simulated results indicated that peat development and carbon accumulation were controlled by variation of water table depth (WTD).
   Simulated results indicated that the Zoige peatlands are the most important component of peatlands in China in terms of carbon stock. Though HPM lacks in driving data of temperature and incomplete climate factors, its limitations in the parameter setting should not offset the added value of the modeling approach in improving our understanding of peatland carbon and their controlling factor dynamics at the long-term scales in the Zoige region where there are very few studies so far.

AB We incubated intact peat cores from depth intervals of 5-15, 15-25, 25-35, and 35-45 cm from ombrotrophic bog, poor fen, and beaver pond margin sections of a cool-temperate peatland. CO2 production was measured over 12-day incubation periods at 4 and 14 degrees C and under oxic and anoxic conditions. Rates ranged from 0.06 to 0.66 mg CO2 g(-1) dry peat d(-1) under oxic conditions and from 0.002 to 0.098 mg CO2 g(-1) d(-1) under anoxic conditions, and rates generally decreased with depth in the profiles. When expressed on a volumetric basis, production rates ranged from 0.3 to 23.4 g CO2 m(-3) d(-1), and there was much less variation in CO2 production rates within profiles because the bull; density of peat increased with depth. The Q(10) quotient, between 4 and 14 degrees C, ranged from 1.0 to 7.7, depending on sample and incubation conditions, with an average of 2.0 for oxic and 2.7 for anoxic conditions. Oxic:anoxic ratios averaged 7:1, 16:1, and 12:1 for the bog, poor fen, and beaver pond margin samples, respectively. Degree of decomposition (von Post index) was the substrate property most strongly correlated with CO2 production. Based on temperature and incubation data for the peat profiles to a depth of 45 cm, annual decomposition values (k) ranged from 0.016 to 0.060 yr(-1) under oxic conditions and from 0.001 to 0.007 yr(-1) under anoxic conditions. A model of CO2 emission from the three sites, based on the incubation data and thermal and water table regime, gave good agreement with measured in Situ CO2 emission rates (r(2) = 0.72, n = 18), although summer emission rates were underpredicted, possibly because of the absence of a root production component in the incubations or because of underestimation of CO2 production rates in held conditions above the water table.

AB The importance of northern peatlands in the global carbon cycle has been recognized, especially for long-term changes. Yet, the complex interactions between climate and peatland hydrology, carbon storage, and area dynamics make it challenging to represent these systems in land surface models. This study describes how peatlands are included as an independent sub-grid hydrological soil unit (HSU) in the ORCHIDEE-MICT land surface model. The peatland soil column in this tile is characterized by multilayered vertical water and carbon transport and peat-specific hydrological properties. The cost-efficient version of TOPMODEL and the scheme of peatland initiation and development from the DYPTOP model are implemented and adjusted to simulate spatial and temporal dynamics of peatland. The model is tested across a range of northern peatland sites and for gridded simulations over the Northern Hemisphere (> 30 degrees N). Simulated northern peatland area (3.9 million km(2)), peat carbon stock (463 Pg C), and peat depth are generally consistent with observed estimates of peatland area (3.4-4.0 million km2), peat carbon (270-540 Pg C), and data compilations of peat core depths. Our results show that both net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (HR) of northern peatlands increased over the past century in response to CO2 and climate change. NPP increased more rapidly than HR, and thus net ecosystem production (NEP) exhibited a positive trend, contributing a cumulative carbon storage of 11.13 PgC since 1901, most of it being realized after the 1950s.

AB Competition is considered an important force in structuring plant communities and in governing niche relations, but communities recovering from disturbance, may be less governed by species interactions and less orderly organized. To address this issue, we studied species richness, abundance and patterns of association between plant species at three spatial scales (1 m(2), 1/25 m(2), 1/625 m(2)) in two ombrotrophic mires in east-central Sweden. One was at a secondary successional stage following peat extraction 50 yr ago and the other was undisturbed. Feat extraction leads to a change in hydrology which is slowly restored by the formation of new peat. Niche breadth and niche overlap along the gradient of height above the water table were calculated for the five common Sphagnum species occurring at both mires in an attempt to better understand differences in species co-occurrence at each mire.
   Species cover differed between the mires, and the number of species per plot was higher in the undisturbed community at all scales, suggesting that the degree of species intermingling was greater than at the harvested site. At all scales, the number of non-random associations was higher, and niche overlap lower among ecologically similar species (e.g. hollow Sphagnum species) in the undisturbed mire. These differences indicate that random events are important in colonization, and that biotic interactions between neighbours later result in a higher degree of non-randomness.
   In addition, we surveyed a number of abandoned peat pit sites to test the effect of disturbance for species composition at a regional scale. Ombrotrophic peat pits contained several Sphagnum species normally associated with minerotrophic mires, and species of wooded mires occurred frequently in pear pits, making them more species-rich than undisturbed bogs. There were also Sphagnum species new to, or rare in, this part of Sweden which indicates effective long-distance dispersal. Even 50 yr after peat extraction had ceased, the vegetation had not recovered to its original composition.

AB This study uses a 12-year time series (2001-2012) of eddy covariance measurements to investigate the long-term net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) and inter-annual variations in relation to abiotic drivers in a boreal fen in northern Sweden. The peatland was a sink for atmospheric CO2 in each of the twelve study years with a 12-year average (+/- standard deviation) NEE of -58 +/- 21 g C m(-2) yr(-1). For ten out of twelve years, the cumulative annual NEE was within a range of -42 to -79 g C m(-2) yr(-1) suggesting a general state of resilience of NEE to moderate inter-annual climate variations. However, the annual NEE of -18 and -106 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2006 and 2008, respectively, diverged considerably from this common range. The lower annual CO2 uptake in 2006 was mainly due to late summer emissions related to an exceptional drop in water table level (WTL). A positive relationship (R-2 = 0.65) between pre-growing season (January to April) air temperature (Ta) and summer (June to July) gross ecosystem production (GEP) was observed. We suggest that enhanced GEP due to mild pre-growing season air temperature in combination with air temperature constraints on ecosystem respiration (ER) during the following cooler summer explained most of the greater net CO2 uptake in 2008. Differences in the annual and growing season means of other abiotic variables (e.g. radiation, vapor pressure deficit, precipitation) and growing season properties (i.e. start date, end date, length) were unable to explain the inter-annual variations of NEE. Overall, our findings suggest that this boreal fen acts as a persistent contemporary sink for atmospheric CO2 that is, however, susceptible to severe anomalies in WTL and pre-growing season air temperature associated with predicted changes in climate patterns for the boreal region.

AB The development of northern high-latitude peatlands played an important role in the carbon (C) balance of the land biosphere since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). At present, carbon storage in northern peatlands is substantial and estimated to be 500 100 Pg C (1 Pg C = 1015 g C). Here, we develop and apply a peatland module embedded in a dynamic global vegetation and land surface process model (LPX-Bern 1.0). The peatland module features a dynamic nitrogen cycle, a dynamic C transfer between peatland acrotelm (upper oxic layer) and catotelm (deep anoxic layer), hydrology- and temperature-dependent respiration rates, and peatland specific plant functional types. Nitrogen limitation down-regulates average modern net primary productivity over peatlands by about half. Decadal acrotelm-to-catotelm C fluxes vary between 20 and +50 g C M-2 yr-1 over the Holocene. Key model parameters are calibrated with reconstructed peat accumulation rates from peat-core data. The model reproduces the major features of the peat core data and of the observation-based modern circumpolar soil carbon distribution. Results from a set of simulations for possible evolutions of northern peat development and areal extent show that soil C stocks in modern peatlands increased by 365-550 Pg C since the LGM, of which 175-272 Pg C accumulated between 11 and 5 kyr BR Furthermore, our simulations suggest a persistent C sequestration rate of 35-50 Pg C per 1000 yr in present-day peatlands under current climate conditions, and that this C sink could either sustain or turn towards a source by 2100 AD depending on climate trajectories as projected for different representative greenhouse gas concentration pathways.

AB Long-term increased nutrient influx into normally nutrient-limited peatlands in combination with altered hydrological conditions may threaten a peatland's carbon storage function and affect its greenhouse gas (GHG) budget. However, in situ studies on the effects of long-term altered conditions on peatland functioning and GHG budgets are scarce. We thus quantified GHG fluxes in a peatland exposed to enhanced water level fluctuations and long-term nutrient infiltration in Ontario, Canada, via eddy-covariance and flux chamber measurements. The peatland was a prominent sink of - 680 +/- 202 g carbon dioxide (CO2) and a source of 22 +/- 8 g methane (CH4) m(-2) year(-1), resulting in a negative radiative forcing of - 80 g CO2 eq. m(-2) y(-1). During the growing season CH4 fluxes were constantly high (0.1 g m(-2) s(-1)). Further, on three dates, we measured nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes and observed a small flux of 2.2 mg m(-2) day(-1) occurring during the thawing period. Taking the studied ecosystem as a model system for other peatlands exposed to long-term increased nutrient infiltration and enhanced water level fluctuations, our data suggest that such peatlands can maintain their carbon storage function and CO2 sequestration may outweigh emissions of CH4.

AB The paleoecology of a peatland in the Laurentian Highlands (Quebec): Identifying the role of climate on peat accumulation. Microscopic (pollen, rhizopods, charcoal) and plant macrofossil analyses were carried out on three cores for a peatland in the Laurentian Highlands (Quebec). The objectives were to reconstruct the developmental history and the past hydrological conditions of the peatland, and to inter paleoclimatic conditions, notably for the moisture balance. The peatland was characterized by contrasting hydrological conditions between the sampling points during its history. Except for the late Holocene, no clear regional hydrological control was revealed by paleobotanical analyses. Feat inception began in a smalt pond around 10 300 cal. years BP in a shrub tundra, more than 2000 years after the ice retreat. The peatland dynamics during the early Holocene likely reflects increased biological productivity caused by the continuous warming of the climate after initial harsh conditions. From 8000 to 3000 BP, a general decrease of the net peat accumulation rate for all cores is in part attributed to the activity of nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria which promotes an important decomposition of the organic matter. An important vertical peat increment occurred during the last 3000 years probably in response to wetter and colder climatic conditions.

AB New pollen data from three contrasting sites in northern Greece allow an analysis of spatial and temporal patterns of vegetation change during the Holocene and Lateglacial in northern Greece. At the principal site, Nisi Fen, six cores from the thickest surficial peat deposits have yielded a detailed, composite, AMS C-14-dated pollen record covering the period from 20 000 cal. BP almost to the present-day. Cores Kp-4 and Bor-3 were taken from small mires at high elevations in the Boras mountains, a few kilometres to the north of Nisi, in which peat has been accumulating since the mid-Holocene. Our results show that only Pinus expanded significantly during the Lateglacial Interstadial, although small thermophilous tree populations were present in the region. The Younger Dryas chronozone is at best marked by subtle vegetational change in favour of steppe taxa. Tree cover increased rapidly at the beginning of the Holocene, with deciduous woodland probably expanding above its present-day altitudinal limits. There is evidence for drier and/or warmer summers, and mild winters, between c. 10 500 and 7500 cal. BP, although the vegetation was not as markedly sclerophyllous as at many sites elsewhere in Greece. The mid-Holocene saw a reorganization of the woodland, with first Abies and then Fagus becoming important at high altitudes, and an increase in the diversity of deciduous woodland at medium elevations. The suggestion of human impact in the form of a decline in woodland and the appearance of crops in the pollen record can be found at all altitudes in the later Holocene.

ID BACTERIAL DIVERSITY; IDENTIFICATION; ARCHAEA; BIOLOGY; SOIL
AB The unique environment of a 4m-thick, free-floating peat island within the Posta Fibreno lake (Central Italy) was analyzed using DNA-based techniques to assess bacterial and fungal community members identity and abundance. Two depths were sampled at 41 and 279 cm from the surface, the former corresponding to an emerged portion of Sphagnum residues accumulated less than 30 yrs ago, and the latter mainly consisting of silty peat belonging to the deeply submerged part of the island, dating back to 1520-1660 AD. The corresponding communities were very diverse, each of them dominated by a different member of the Delta-proteobacteria class for prokaryotes. Among Eukaryotes, Ascomycota prevailed in the shallow layer while Basidiomycota were abundant in the deep sample. The identity of taxa partitioning between acidic surface layer and neutral core is very reminiscent of the differences reported between bogs and fens respectively, supporting the view of Posta Fibreno as a relic transitional floating mire. Moreover, some microbial taxa show an unusual concurrent species convergence between this sub-Mediterranean site and far Nordic or circumpolar environments. This study represents the first report describing the biotic assemblages of such a peculiar environment, and provides some insights into the possible mechanisms of its evolution.

AB Peatlands store globally significant amounts of carbon and are important sources of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. However, for reasons which are not well understood, many peatland soils produce smaller amounts of CH4 than theoretically predicted, and carbon dioxide (CO2) produced during anaerobic decomposition in peatland soils cannot be accounted for by commonly measured microbial processes. Here we show that the reduction of solid-phase organic matter (i.e., humic substances) suppresses CH4 production in a bog soil and can be responsible for 33-61% of the total carbon mineralization in this soil. These results demonstrate that the reduction of organic matter is a key component of anaerobic decomposition in peatlands, and is at least partially responsible for their low CH4 production. Thus, organic matter reduction may be a key regulator of how peatlands respond to ongoing global change.

AB We report the results of an investigation on the processes controlling heat transport in peat under a large bog in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands. For 2 years, starting in July 1998, we recorded temperature at 12 depth intervals from 0 to 400 cm within a vertical peat profile at the crest of the bog at sub-daily intervals. We also recorded air temperature I m above the peat surface. We calculate a peat thermal conductivity of 0.5 W m(-1)degrees C(-1) and model vertical heat transport through the peat using the SUTRA model. The model was calibrated to the first year of data, and then evaluated against the second year of collected heat data. The model results suggest that advective pore-water flow is not necessary to transport heat within the peat profile and most of the heat is transferred by thermal conduction alone in these waterlogged soils. In the spring season, a zero-curtain effect controls the transport of heat through shallow depths of the peat. Changes in local climate and the resulting changes in thermal transport still may cause non-linear feedbacks in methane emissions related to the generation of methane deeper within the peat profile as regional temperatures increase.

AB Northern peatlands play a major role in the global carbon cycle as sinks for CO2 and as sources of CH4. These diverse ecosystems develop through accumulation of partially decomposed plant material as peat. With increasing depth, peat becomes more and more recalcitrant due to its longer exposure to decomposing processes. Compared with surface peat, deeper peat sediments remain microbiologically poorly described. We detected active archaeal communities even in the deep bottom layers (-220/-280 cm) of two Finnish fen-type peatlands by 16S rRNA-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. In the sediments of the northern study site, all detected archaea were methanogens with Rice Cluster II (RC-II) and Methanosaetaceae as major groups. In southern peatland, Crenarchaeota of a rare unidentified cluster were present together with mainly RC-II methanogens. RNA profiles showed a larger archaeal diversity than DNA-based community profiles, suggesting that small but active populations were better visualized with rRNA. In addition, potential methane production measurements indicated methanogenic activity throughout the vertical peat profiles.

AB We present the results of high-resolution, multi-proxy palaeoecological investigations of two parallel peat cores from the Baltic raised bog Mechacz Wielki in NE Poland. We aim to evaluate the role of regional climate and autogenic processes of the raised bog itself in driving the vegetation and hydrology dynamics. Based on partly synchronous changes in Sphagnum communities in the two study cores we suggest that extrinsic factors (climate) played an important role as a driver in mire development during the bog stage (500-2012 CE). Using a testate amoebae transfer function, we found exceptionally stable hydrological conditions during the last 2000 years with a relatively high water table and lack of local fire events that allowed for rapid peat accumulation (2.75 mm/year) in the bog. Further, the strong correlation between pH and community-weighted mean of testate amoeba traits suggests that other variables than water-table depth play a role in driving microbial properties under stable hydrological conditions. There is a difference in hydrological dynamics in bogs between NW and NE Poland until ca 1500 CE, after which the water table reconstructions show more similarities. Our results illustrate how various functional traits relate to different environmental variables in a range of trophic and hydrological scenarios on long time scales. Moreover, our data suggest a common regional climatic forcing in Mechacz Wielki, Gazwa and Kontolanrahka. Though it may still be too early to attempt a regional summary of wetness change in the southern Baltic region, this study is a next step to better understand the long-term peatland palaeohydrology in NE Europe.

AB Peatlands are a dominant landform in the northern hemisphere, accumulating carbon in the form of peat due to an imbalance between decomposition and plant production rates. Decomposer (saprobes) and mycorrhizal fungi significantly influence carbon dynamics by degrading organic matter via the synthesis of extracellular enzymes. As organic matter decomposes, litter quality variables figure most prominently in the succession of fungi. Hence, litters composed primarily of complex polymers decompose very slowly. Surprisingly, recalcitrant polymer degraders (mostly basidiomycetes) are rarely isolated from peat, which may explain the accumulation of complex polymers in peat profiles. While enzymatic profiles of mycorrhizal fungi and other root endophytes may be more limited compared with saprobes, many of these fungi can degrade polymers of varying complexity as well and hence may also be significant decomposers of organic matter. To date, anamorphic ascomycetes and zygomycetes are the most frequently isolated fungi from peatlands (63 and 10% of all taxa, respectively), and chytridiomycetes, teleomorphic ascomycetes, and basidiomycetes appear to be less common (11% of all taxa). The remaining 16% of taxa remain unidentified or are sterile taxa. How disturbances affect peatland microbial communities and their roles is virtually unknown. This aspect of peatland microbial ecology requires immediate attention. The objective of this paper is to review the current state of knowledge of the diversity of fungi and their roles in carbon cycling dynamics in peatlands.

AB Palaeoecological techniques and radiocarbon datings were used to reconstruct the initiation and development of a sloping bog system near Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada. Peat initiation began around 12 000 cal. BP, possibly as a result of a cool, wet climate prior to the insolation maximum. A Picea sitchensis-Tsuga heterophylla-Alnus minerotrophic wet fern forest occupied the study site from 9300 to 8300 cal. BP. Between 8300 and 7500 cal. BP, cooler and wetter climatic conditions promoted increased organic matter accumulation and paludification by Sphagnum species. Subsequent lateral expansion has been very slow in the later Holocene. Paludification resulted in a shift to a scrubby, less productive Pinus contorta-T heterophylla-Cupressaceae-Cyperaceae bog woodland around approximately 7500-3000 cal. BP. The modem Cupressaceae-Pinus contorta-T heterophylla-Ericaceae-Cyperaceae mire was well established by 2000 cal. BP and a modem oceanic climate was predominant. The initiation and development of the studied bog corresponds to regional climatic and successional trends. However, the average long-term apparent rate of carbon accumulation (LORCA) was low compared to rates from other northern ntires, only 6.3 +/- 0.6 (SE) g m(-2) yr(-1). About 53% of the present carbon store was already accumulated by 6200 cal. BP. This study emphasizes that mire initiation and slow forest paludification in north coastal British Columbia is a multidirectional process resulting from complex interactions between climatic and autogenic factors.

AB The article provides data on distribution, biological features, long-term population dynamics and modern conditions of the heath butterfly Coenonympha oedippus (Fabricius, 1787) on the territory of Belorussia. In the Belorussian Polesie region, there is quite dense network of large settlements of this species on large bog massifs. The species is very sensitive to overgrowing of the habitats by bushes and reeds caused by the drop of the groundwater level in the bogs due to the water drainage by land reclamation systems and the climate warming. The overgrowing of the bogs has significantly accelerated in the last decades when they have been no longer used for mowing. In the same time, the fight against bogs bushing by burning vegetation and mechanized mowing is a concern for the well-being of the settlements of C. oedippus.

AB Across northern Alberta, Canada, bogs experience periodic wildfire and, in the Fort McMurray region, are exposed to increasing atmospheric N deposition related to oil sands development. As the fire return interval shortens and/or growing season temperatures increase, the regional peatland CO2-C sink across northern Alberta will likely decrease, but the magnitude of the decrease could be diminished if increasing atmospheric N deposition alters N cycling in a way that stimulates post-fire successional development in bogs. We quantified net ammonification, nitrification, and dissolved organic N (DON) production in surface peat along a post-fire chronosequence of five bogs where we also experimentally manipulated N deposition (no water controls plus 0, 10, and 20 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) simulated deposition, as NH4NO3). Initial KCl-extractable NH4+-N, NO3--N and DON averaged 176 +/- 6, 54 +/- 0.2, and 3580 +/- 40 ng N cm(-3), respectively, with no consistent changes as a function of time since fire and no consistent effects of experimental N addition. Net ammonification, nitrification, and DON production averaged 3.8 +/- 0.3, 1.6 +/- 0.2, and 14.3 +/- 2.0 ng N cm(-3) d(-1), also with no consistent changes as a function of time since fire and no consistent effects of experimental N addition. Our hypothesis that N mineralization would be stimulated after fire because root death would create a pulse of labile soil organic C was not supported, most likely because ericaceous plant roots typically are not killed in boreal bog wildfires. The absence of any N mineralization response to experimental N addition is most likely a result of rapid immobilization of added NH4+-N and NO3 (-)-N in peat with a wide C:N ratio. In these boreal bogs, belowground N cycling is likely characterized by large DON pools that turn over relatively slowly and small DIN pools that turn over relatively rapidly. For Alberta bogs that have persisted at historically low N deposition values and begin to receive higher N deposition related to anthropogenic activities, peat N mineralization processes may be largely unaffected until the peat C:N ratio reaches a point that no longer favors immobilization of NH4+-N and NO3--N.

AB In the UK, the majority of peatlands have been damaged by drainage, agriculture, forestry plantations or erosion, compromising the ecosystem services they deliver including carbon sequestration. On the other hand, since the 1990s many projects have carried out a range of interventions to restore peatlands. In forest-to-bog restoration, tree removal and drain blocking lead to immediately visible changes. However, while some key plant species return within years, they may continue to exhibit differences in how they perform and interact with their environment. To investigate this, plant functional traits were measured and compared for Calluna vulgaris, Erica tetralix, Eriophorum angustifolium, Eriophorum vaginatum, Sphagnum capillifolium and Sphagnum papillosum collected in an open blanket bog, a forestry plantation and two forest-to-bog restoration sites in northern Scotland. Significantly lower specific leaf area and chlorophyll content, and higher leaf dry matter content, were found in the open bog site compared with plantation and forest-to-bog sites. This could be related to nutrient enrichment derived from brash and needle decomposition in the latter sites, suggesting a lasting effect of coniferous plantations even after decades of restoration management. Altered plant functional traits may have feedbacks on ecosystem processes such as litter decomposition and peat formation.

AB Capsule: Habitat structure and composition explained spatial variation in breeding distribution and nesting success in a declining upland Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata population in North Wales.
   Aims: To identify environmental correlates of Curlew breeding distribution, nesting success and change in distribution.
   Methods: Thirty random 1 km squares stratified by historical population trend were surveyed for Curlew density and nesting success, and habitat-and predation-related variables in a landscape containing agriculturally improved farmland, and moorland that was partly protected and subject to grazing reductions for nature conservation. Analyses tested for associations between Curlew measures and environmental variables.
   Results: Curlew breeding density declined by 29% between 1994 and 2008, and was highest in squares comprising a mixture of moorland and agriculturally improved farmland, and in squares with lower vegetation density and higher cover of Nardus stricta (characteristic of rough grazing). Nesting success was positively associated with cover of Trichophorum germanicum (characteristic of mire). Vegetation density was lower than average in squares with the highest Curlew densities, while in the protected area vegetation density was higher than average.
   Conclusion: Habitat and vegetation variables influenced Curlew distribution and nesting success in North Wales, largely in line with previous results but with no evidence for predator-related influences. Habitat condition for Curlew in the protected area could probably be increased through targeted increases in grazing alongside the protection of priority habitats.

ID NORTHERN MINNESOTA; ORGANIC-ACIDS; DISSOLUTION; GROUNDWATER; QUARTZ
AB An investigation of silicate weathering in a Minnesota mire indicates that quartz and aluminosilicates rapidly dissolve in anoxic, organic-rich, neutral-pH environments.  Vertical profiles of pH, dissolved silicon, and major cations were obtained at a raised bog and a spring fen and compared.  Profiles of readily extractable silicon, diatom abundance, ash mineralogy, and silicate surface texture were determined from peat cores collected at each site.
   In the bog, normally a recharge mound, dissolved silicon increases with depth as pH increases, exceeding the background silicon concentration by a factor of two.  Silicate grains surfaces, including quartz, are chemically etched at this location, despite being in contact with pore water at neutral pH with dissolved silicon well above the equilibrium solubility of quartz.  The increasing silica concentrations at circum-neutral pH are consistent with a system where silicate solubility is influenced by silica-organic-acid complexes.  Silica-organic-acid complexes therefore may be the cause of the almost complete absence of diatoms in decomposed peat and contribute to the formation of silica-depleted underclays commonly found beneath coal.

AB Northern peatlands are Substantial sinks of carbon (C), yet the sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from peatlands are largely unknown. Since the relationship between roots and peat in C cycling is important, vascular plants growing on the surface of peat deposits should influence CO2 efflux from the peat surface and the overall C balance in peatlands. In our study, 30-cm peat cores were removed from an ombrotrophic bog in boreal, continental western Canada. Surface vegetation in the cores remained intact and included a continuous bryophyte cover dominated by Sphagnum fuscum. In addition, some cores were collected such that either ericaceous shrubs (Ledum groenlandicum) or sedges (Eriophorum vaginatum) were present. We investigated how the presence of each vegetation type influenced soil respiration and the microbial mineralization of root exudates using a pulse C-14 labeling of vegetation in the intact peat cores. The role of root biomass and toot respiration in CO2 emission and C allocation was quantified for each type of vegetation and compared through both measurement and modeling. Our results show that vascular plants contributed 35-57% of total CO2 efflux from the peat surface, primarily derived from rhizosphere processes, including root respiration as well as microbial mineralization of root exudates. The mineralization of root exudates contributed 14-53 mu mol C-CO(2)(.)m(-2).d(-1) (17-24% of total) to CO2 efflux, depending on vegetation type and moisture conditions. The type of vegetation present did not influence the total amount of photosynthetic fixation over the course of the study, but did affect how C was allocated within and between both the aboveground and belowground components of the peat column.

AB Biodiversity in wetland habitats is strongly affected by drainage. In Sweden, rich fens (alkaline fens) have been particularly affected by drainage campaigns for forestry and conversion to agricultural land. Fragmentation of the landscape, invasion of tall vascular plants as well as Polytrichum and Sphagnum mosses and substrate degradation all lead to reduced plant diversity.
   We evaluated the recolonization potential of four characteristic rich fen bryophyte species that use to decrease rapidly after drainage (Scorpidium scorpioides, Scorpidium cossonii, Pseudocalliergon trifarium and Campylium stellatum) by performing transplantation studies with gametophyte fragments in recently hydrologically restored rich fens. In greenhouse and field experiments I cm fragments of all four species had a high survival rate and established well, especially after surface liming of the peat. A protective cover increased the colonization success and the growth potential of the added fragments. Even small alterations of the water level (5 cm) resulted in differences in biomass growth of the fragments of S. cossonii and C. stellatum. Our results show that it is possible to reintroduce bryophyte species lost after drainage using gametophyte fragments as propagules, and that these techniques seem feasible for a number of characteristic rich fen bryophytes. These findings will be of importance when methods for practical restoration of rich fens are developed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ability of Sphagnum moss to efficiently intercept atmospheric nitrogen(N) has been assumed to be vulnerable to increased N deposition. However, the proposed critical load (20 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) to exceed the capacity of the Sphagnum N filter has not been confirmed. A long-term (11 years) and realistic N manipulation on Whim bog was used to study the N filter function of Sphagnum (Sphagnum capillifolium) in response to increased wet N deposition. On this ombrotrophic peatland where ambient deposition was 8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), an additional 8, 24, and 56 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) of either ammonium (NH4+) or nitrate (NO3-) has been applied for 11 years. Nutrient status of Sphagnum and pore water quality from the Sphagnum layer were assessed. The N filter function of Sphagnum was still active up to 32 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) even after 11 years. N saturation of Sphagnum and subsequent increases in dissolved inorganic N (DIN) concentration in pore water occurred only for 56 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) of NH4+ addition. These results indicate that the Sphagnum N filter is more resilient to wet N deposition than previously inferred. However, functionality will be more compromised when NH4+ dominates wet deposition for high inputs (56 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). The N filter function in response to NO3- uptake increased the concentration of dissolved organic N(DON) and associated organic anions in pore water. NH4+ uptake increased the concentration of base cations and hydrogen ions in pore water though ion exchange. The resilience of the Sphagnum N filter can explain the reported small magnitude of species change in the Whim bog ecosystem exposed to wet N deposition. However, changes in the leaching substances, arising from the assimilation of NO3- and NH4+, may lead to species change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatland ecosystems have been consistent carbon (C) sinks for millennia, but it has been predicted that exposure to warmer temperatures and drier conditions associated with climate change will shift the balance between ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration providing a positive feedback to atmospheric CO2 concentration. Our main objective was to determine the sensitivity of ecosystem photosynthesis, respiration and net ecosystem production (NEP) measured by eddy covariance, to variation in temperature and water table depth associated with interannual shifts in weather during 2004-2009. Our study was conducted in a moderately rich treed fen, the most abundant peatland type in western Canada, in a region (northern Alberta) where peatland ecosystems are a significant landscape component. During the study, the average growing season (May-October) water depth declined approximately 38 cm, and temperature [expressed as cumulative growing degree days (GDD, March-October)] varied approximately 370 GDD. Contrary to previous predictions, both ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration showed similar increases in response to warmer and drier conditions. The ecosystem remained a strong net sink for CO2 with an average NEP (+/- SD) of 189 +/- 47 g C m-2 yr-1. The current net CO2 uptake rates were much higher than C accumulation in peat determined from analyses of the relationship between peat age and cumulative C stock. The balance between C addition to, and total loss from, the top 0-30 cm depth (peat age range 0-70 years) of shallow peat cores averaged 43 +/- 12 g C m-2 yr-1. The apparent long-term average rate of net C accumulation in basal peat samples was 19-24 g C m-2 yr-1. The difference between current rates of net C uptake and historical rates of peat accumulation is likely a result of vegetation succession and recent increases in tree establishment and productivity.

AB Both eutrophication and SO4 pollution can lead to higher availability of nutrients and potentially toxic compounds in wetlands. To unravel the interaction between the level of eutrophication and toxicity at species and community level, effects of SO4 were tested in nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich fen mesocosms. Biomass production of aquatic and semi-aquatic macrophytes and colonization of the water layer increased after fertilization, leading to dominance of highly competitive species. SO4 addition increased alkalinity and sulphide concentrations, leading to decomposition and additional eutrophication. SO4 pollution and concomitant sulphide production considerably reduced biomass production and colonization, but macrophytes were less vulnerable in fertilized conditions. The experiment shows that competition between species, vegetation succession and terrestrialization are not only influenced by nutrient availability, but also by toxicity, which strongly interacts with the level of eutrophication. This implies that previously neutralized toxicity effects in eutrophied fens may appear after nutrient reduction measures have been taken. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We reconstructed the Holocene developmental history of a kettle-hole peatland in the Tuchola Forest of Northern Poland, using pollen, testat amoebae and plant macrofossil indicators. Our aims were to determine the timing and pattern of autogenic succession and natural and anthropogenic influences on the peatland. Northern Poland is under mixed oceanic and continental climatic influences but has so far been less studied in a palaeoecological context than more oceanic regions of Europe. In the first terrestrial developmental phase of the mire, the testate amoebae-inferred depth to water table revealed two major dry shifts at ca. 9400 (end of lake phase) and ca. 7100 cal BP (a period of global cooling and dry shift in Western Europe). Conditions became wetter again in two steps at ca. 6700 and ca. 5800 BP after a dry event at ca. 6100 BP. The timing of the wet shift at 5800 BP corresponds to wet periods in Western Europe. Peat accumulation rates were low (0.1 mm yr(-1)) between ca. 5600 and ca. 3000 BP when sedges dominated the peatland. In the last 2500 yrs surface moisture fluctuated with wet events at ca. 2750-2400, and 2000 BP, and dry events at ca. 2250-2100 and 1450 BP. After 1450 BP a trend towards wetter conditions culminated at ca. 500 cal BP, possibly caused by local deforestation. Over the mire history, pH (inferred from testate amoebae) was mostly low (around 5) with two short-lived shifts to alkaline conditions (7.5) at ca. 6100 and 1450 BP indicating a minerotrophic influence from surface run-off into the mire. Up to about 1000 BP the ecological shifts inferred from the three proxies agree with palaeoclimatic records from Poland and Western Europe. After this date, however correlation is less clear suggesting an increasing local anthropogenic impact on the mire. This study confirms that kettle-hole peatlands can yield useful palaeoenvironmental data as well as recording land-use change and calls for more comparable studies in regions are the interface between major climate influences.

AB We used direct radiocarbon dates of peat samples, pollen dates and land-uplift chronology from >1300 cores comprising all or most of the Holocene in the boreal region of Finland, Estonia and Maine (USA) to obtain long-term carbon accumulation rates for boreal peatlands. The ''apparent'' long-term rate of carbon accumulation (LORCA; g C m(-2) a(-1)) ranged from 4.6 to 85.8 (mean 19.9 +/- 10.7), depending on the geographical location, wetland type and the age of the mire. The ''true'' or ''actual'' rate of carbon accumulation (ARCA), as derived from models for peatbog growth, was usually ca. 70% of LORCA. We studied the raised bog Reksuo more intensely in terms of growth dynamics, and we report preliminary results of the ''three-dimensional'' or spatial carbon accumulation rates. These results strongly contradict the concept of constant input and constant decay throughout the millennia. The study emphasizes the importance of exploring the formation and dynamics of entire mire ecosystems, and the role of carbon in these systems, in addition to studying single cores.

AB Fen peatlands represent a globally important carbon (C) store, while also providing highly productive agricultural land. Drainage of these organic soils is required to create conditions suitable for crop growth, but this results in substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. One potential GHG mitigation option is to raise the groundwater table to reduce the duration and volume of peat exposure to aerobic conditions. However, the trade-off between maintaining food production and securing ecosystem function under a high water table (WT) presents a serious challenge for both land managers and policy makers. Therefore, we conducted a controlled mesocosm experiment to investigate the effects of WT elevation (from similar to 50 cm to similar to 30 cm) under three contrasting scenarios: (i) WT raised throughout the year, (ii) WT raised in the winter only, and (iii) WT raised in the growing season only. We measured GHG emissions, nitrate, ammonium and dissolved organic C concentrations in soil solution, alongside the yield of a commercially important crop (lettuce). Raising the WT throughout the year reduced lettuce yields by 37% and reduced CO2 emissions by 36% without changing the loss rates of N2O or CH4. Raising the WT only in the winter did not significantly reduce crop yield, but still suppressed CO2 emissions during the fallow period (by 30%). Raising the WT only in the growing season reduced root growth and CO2 emissions (by 27%), but had no major effect on lettuce yield. In conclusion, the present study shows that raising the groundwater table in the non-growing season reduced GHG emissions without negatively affecting lettuce yields, and may therefore represent a viable GHG mitigation option for agricultural peatlands.

AB Although grazing was a part of calcareous fens' disturbance regimes, few studies have examined the impact of grazing release in these systems, and managers are reticent to experiment with restoring grazing for management purposes. Here I describe vegetation, edaphic, and hydrologic differences in a Wisconsin calcareous fen between areas long-protected (since 1987) from cattle grazing and those protected in 2011, 2.5 years before the study. Vegetation surveys found that the long-protected areas had significantly lower floristic quality, fewer rare and specialist species, and more woody-plant encroachment than areas abandoned in 2011. Interviews with a farmer and air-photo interpretations suggested that vegetation changed in the protected areas around the time of abandonment. Known edaphic and hydrologic drivers of vegetation change in fens (volumetric water content, electrical conductivity, nutrient availability) could not account for the vegetation differences between the two areas. Site histories found no events accounting for these vegetation differences other than grazing. These results suggest that grazing release led to increased shrub encroachment, decline in floristic quality, and-possibly- a decline in specialist and rare species.

AB Surface peat becomes compacted by the combined effects of biological decomposition processes (mechanical breakdown and decay) and of the physical squeezing of peat into a smaller, more consolidated volume. We use corresponding determinations of age and depth of 1041 surface peat cores from 14 Scandinavian boreal mires to demonstrate that, at least for the first 40 years after the peat is deposited, the compaction process can be adequately described by assuming a constant compaction rate. This result is used to calculate vertical surface peat growth rates that are corrected for compaction. Estimated compaction rates did not differ significantly between lawn and hummock habitats while significant differences that were not related to latitude were found among mires. We interpret this as an indication that compaction rates depend on hydrology at the scale of mires. Vertical peat growth rates differed strongly among mires and between habitats within mires, indicating considerable variation at several spatial scales.

AB Estimates of peat depth are required to inform understanding of peatland development, functioning, and ecosystem services such as carbon storage. However, there is a considerable lack of peat depth data at local, national, and global scales. Recent studies have attempted to address this knowledge deficit by using manual probing and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to estimate depth. Despite increasing application, little consideration has been given to the accuracy of either of these techniques. This study examines the accuracy of probing and GPR for measuring peat depth. Corresponding GPR and probing surveys were carried out at a catchment scale in a blanket peatland. GPR depth estimations, calibrated using common midpoint (CMP) surveys, were found to be on average 35% greater than probe measurements. The source of disagreement was found to be predominantly caused by depth probes becoming obstructed by artifacts within the peat body, although occasionally probing rods also penetrated sediments underlying the peat. Using the Complex Refractive Index Model, it was found that applying a single velocity of 0.036 m ns(-1) across a single site may also result in -8 to +17% error in estimation of peat depth due to spatial variability in water content and porosity. It is suggested that GPR calibrated at each site using CMP surveys may provide a more accurate method for measuring peat depth.

AB Models of peat accumulation assume that peat decomposition occurs mostly above the water table, with little or no decomposition once peat enters the deeper, saturated, anoxic zone. However, few such measurements of peat decomposition exist. In this paper we quantified differences in degree of decomposition, botanical composition, and organic chemical composition of peat from three temperate peatlands with different water table levels. All sites had a thick layer of herbaceous peat, capped by a layer of Sphagnum peat. The lignin content and degree of decomposition, measured by the pyrophosphate index, generally increased with depth. Analysis of the lignin with cupric oxide (CuO) oxidation revealed most of the chemical differences between peat deposits occurred in the upper, aerated peat layer, as expected. The upper layer of Sphagnum peat was characterized by high p-hydroxyl phenolic yield, whereas Sphagnum peat below the water table exhibited a high degree of humification and high yield of vanillyl oxidation products despite being of similar botanical composition. Surprisingly, herbaceous peat below the water table was similar in terms of degree of decomposition to younger herbaceous peat. The results confirm that peat decomposition occurs mostly above the water table, although botanical source, climate, and local hydrology interact to create multiple trajectories in peat chemistry.

AB Peatlands are globally important areas for carbon preservation; although covering only 3% of global land area, they store 30% of total soil carbon. Lowland peat soils can also be very productive for agriculture, but their cultivation requires drainage as most crops are intolerant of root-zone anoxia. This leads to the creation of oxic conditions in which organic matter becomes vulnerable to mineralisation. Given the demand for high quality agricultural land. 40% of the UK's peatlands have been drained for agricultural use.
   In this study we present the outcomes of a controlled environment experiment conducted on agricultural fen peat to examine possible trade-offs between celery growth (an economically important crop on the agricultural peatlands of eastern England) and emissions of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)) at different temperatures (ambient and ambient +5 degrees C), water table levels (-30 cm, and -50 cm below the surface), and fertiliser use.
   Raising the water table from -50 cm to -30 cm depressed yields of celery, and at the same time decreased the entire ecosystem CO2 loss by 31%. A 5 degrees C temperature increase enhanced ecosystem emissions of CO2 by 25% and increased celery dry shoot weight by 23% while not affecting the shoot fresh weight. Fertiliser addition increased both celery yields and soil respiration by 22%. Methane emissions were generally very low and not significantly different from zero.
   Our results suggest that increasing the water table can lower emissions of greenhouse gases and reduce the rate of peat wastage, but reduces the productivity of celery. If possible, the water table should be raised to -30 cm before and after cultivation, and only decreased during the growing season, as this would reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions and peat loss, potentially not affecting the production of vegetable crops.

AB Mapping of forest types in the Tanana river floodplain, interior Alaska, is performed using a maximum-a-posteriori Bayesian classifier applied on SAR data acquired by the NASA/JPL three-frequency polarimetric AIRSAR system on several dates. Five vegetation types are separated, dominated by 1) white spruce, 2) balsam poplar, 3) black spruce, 4) alder/willow shrubs, and 5) bog/fen/nonforest vegetation. Open water of rivers and lakes is also separated. Accuracy of forest classification is investigated as a function of frequency and polarization of the radar, as well as the forest seasonal state, which includes winter/frozen, winter/thawed, spring/flooded, spring/unflooded, and summer/dry conditions. Classifications indicate that C-band is a more useful frequency for separating forest types than L- or P-bands, and HV polarization is the most useful polarization at all frequencies. The highest classification accuracy, with 90 percent of forest pixels classified correctly, is obtained by combining L-band HV and C-band HV data acquired in spring as seasonal river flooding recedes and before deciduous tree species have leaves. In 17 forest stands for which actual percentages of each tree species are known, the same radar data are capable of predicting tree species composition with less than 10 percent error. For the same combination of observation channels, classification accuracy is 79 percent in spring on a day of intense river flooding, and 62 percent on a dry summer day with leaves on deciduous trees. In winter, using 4-look SAR data instead of 16-look, classification accuracy is 55 percent on a frozen day, and 76 percent on a thawed day. White spruce and balsam poplar stands are best separated in thawed conditions when balsam poplar trees have no leaves. From our classification, we predict that current and future spaceborne SAR systems will have limited mapping capabilities when used alone. Yet, RADARSAT combined with J-ERS-1 and ERS-1 could resolve forest types with 80 percent accuracy, separate nonforest areas resulting from commercial logging or forest wildfire, and map river edges. For comparison, a combination of green, red, and near-infrared radiance data acquired by SPOT-2 on a dry summer day yields a classification accuracy of 83 percent for the same forest stands, with limited success in distinguishing among deciduous forest types and among coniferous forest types.

AB Aims To develop the first comprehensive syntaxonomic classification for patchy montane mire and spring vegetation across the Irano-Turanian phytogeographical region in Iran, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan and to explore the effects of the main environmental and geographic gradients on their distribution. Location Alborz Mountain range (Iran), Pamir-Alai Mountains (Tajikistan) and Tian Shan Mountains (Kyrgyzstan); total area about 3,000,000 km(2). Methods A database of 1,015 vegetation releves including a total of 675 vascular and bryophyte taxa was established, covering the large mountains ranges of the Irano-Turanian regions in Iran, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, at altitudes ranging from 1,300 to 4,505 m a.s.l. A semi-supervised k-means analysis was performed. Additional analyses were carried out to show differences among predefined vegetation groups in terms of phytogeographical, climatic and compositional factors. Results Two large groups of mire communities, referable to mires and springs were identified. Twenty associations, one subassociation and four alliances of these wetlands, belonging to three orders and three classes, were defined. Among them, ten associations, one subassociation and two alliances were formally described as new syntaxa. Moreover, a new order Caricetalia orbicularis, that comprises phytogeographically unique vegetation of the Irano-Turanian mires, is proposed. Conclusions Based on our results and comparison between the Irano-Turanian and other phytogeographical regions, we propose a first comprehensive syntaxonomic synopsis for the Irano-Turanian mires and springs. Despite some identical character species and their vicariant nature, the Irano-Turanian, Euro-Siberian and Mediterranean mires and springs show considerable compositional differences. Irano-Turanian wetlands contain a large and distinct set of endemic plant species, which are mixed with Euro-Siberian species in the west and north, but predominate in the eastern locations. They have a patchy pattern and scattered distribution and serve as inland hotspots of wetland vegetation in the vast dry landscape of southwest and Central Asia.

AB Forest productivity declines along the transition zones (ecotone) occupying the elevational gradient from upland boreal forest to peatlands. This decline is associated with water table rise and increasing peat depth from upper to lower topographic positions. We hypothesize that in boreal transition zones to poor fens, phosphorus limitations to plant growth are imposed by low pH, rising water table and increasing depth to mineral soil in the waterlogged peat. These phosphorus limitations, together with 02 limitations to root growth, cause sharp decline of productivity down to the fen. The ecosys model was applied to test these hypotheses in a boreal transition zone in central Saskatchewan, Canada. This zone extended from an upland black spruce forest down to a poor forested fen over an organic-mineral soil gradient with peat depth increasing from 60 cm to 160 cm. Model output was compared with field-derived tree carbon stocks, leaf area indexes, and moss net primary productivities at upper, middle, and lower undisturbed ecotone positions. Model results suggest that root contact with mineral soil through shallow peat over a deep water table at the upper ecotone sustained phosphorus uptake and plants did not experience phosphorus limitations. However deep peat and shallow water table towards the fen prevented root contact with mineral soil, imposing phosphorus limitations to plants growing in the poor, acidic peat, causing productivity decline by similar to 75-80%, and tree biomass decline from 6900 to 2100 g Cm-2 in the model vs. similar to 6600 to 800 g Cm-2 observed along the ecotone. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The electromagnetic spectrum registered via satellite remote sensing methods became a popular data source that can enrich traditional methods of vegetation monitoring. The European Space Agency Sentinel-2 mission, thanks to its spatial (10-20 m) and spectral resolution (12 spectral bands registered in visible-, near-, and mid-infrared spectrum) and primarily its short revisit time (5 days), helps to provide reliable and accurate material for the identification of mountain vegetation. Using the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm and reference data (botanical map of non-forest vegetation, field survey data, and high spatial resolution images) it was possible to classify eight vegetation types of Giant Mountains: bogs and fens, deciduous shrub vegetation, forests, grasslands, heathlands, subalpine tall forbs, subalpine dwarf pine scrubs, and rock and scree vegetation. Additional variables such as principal component analysis (PCA) bands and selected vegetation indices were included in the best classified dataset. The results of the iterative classification, repeated 100 times, were assessed as approximately 80% median overall accuracy (OA) based on multi-temporal datasets composed of images acquired through the vegetation growing season (from late spring to early autumn 2018), better than using a single-date scene (70%-72% OA). Additional variables did not significantly improve the results, showing the importance of spectral and temporal information themselves. Our study confirms the possibility of fully available data for the identification of mountain vegetation for management purposes and protection within national parks.

AB Mountain fens are uncommon and unique wetlands in the southern Appalachian Highlands. We selected four mountain fens in North Carolina to compare soil particle-size distribution, organic carbon, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and exchangeable Mg+2, Ca+2, and K+. Three of the sites are depressional areas on alluvial floodplains at elevations between 700 and 1130 m above sea level, while the fourth site is located on a slope intersecting ground-water seepage at an elevation of 950 m. Feat accumulation amounted to a shallow surface Sphagnum layer (usually <5 cm) at three sites, and the organic carbon content of the surface soil horizon ranged from 4 to 21%. Three of the soils would be classified as Cumulic Humaquepts, and the other is a Terric Haplohemist. The pH of the surface horizon of the four soils ranged from 4.3 to 4.9. The alluvial fens had higher silt concentrations than the seepage fen, and two of the alluvial fens had a subsurface, fine-textured deposit. The seepage fen showed little textural variation with depth. Exchangeable Ca+2 concentrations were higher for the seepage fen. The CEC ranged from 15 to 62 cmol, kg(-1) in the surface horizon, and base saturation (Ca+2, Mg+2, and K+) was <12% for the three alluvial fens and 20% for the seepage fen. Base saturation increased to 40% in the lower horizons of the seepage fen but remained <10% for the alluvial fens. The differences in soil characteristics suggest that geomorphic location should be considered when comparing mountain fens.

AB Peat bogs have historically represented exceptional carbon (C) sinks because of their extremely low decomposition rates and consequent accumulation of plant remnants as peat. Among the factors favoring that peat accumulation, a major role is played by the chemical quality of plant litter itself, which is poor in nutrients and characterized by polyphenols with a strong inhibitory effect on microbial breakdown. Because bogs receive their nutrient supply solely from atmospheric deposition, the global increase of atmospheric nitrogen (N) inputs as a consequence of human activities could potentially alter the litter chemistry with important, but still unknown, effects on their C balance. Here we present data showing the decomposition rates of recently formed litter peat samples collected in nine European countries under a natural gradient of atmospheric N deposition from approximate to 0.2 to 2 g center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1). We found that enhanced decomposition rates for material accumulated under higher atmospheric N supplies resulted in higher carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and dissolved organic carbon release. The increased IN availability favored microbial decomposition (i) by removing N constraints on microbial metabolism and (ii) through a chemical amelioration of litter peat quality with a positive feedback on microbial enzymatic activity. Although some uncertainty remains about whether decay-resistant Sphagnum will continue to dominate litter peat, our data indicate that, even without such changes, increased N deposition poses a serious risk to our valuable peatland C sinks.

AB Despite substantial contrary evidence, there has been a growing tendency to present prescribed vegetation burning as a management practice that is always damaging to peatland ecosystems in the UK. This is exemplified by the "Burning and Peatlands" position statement published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature UK Peatland Programme. Indeed, while we strongly agree with several of the statements made within this position statement, it also contains a series of unverified assertions and misleading arguments that seemingly serve to simplify the narrative and paint prescribed burning as a wholly damaging peatland management tool. Given that this position statement is published by one of the UK's most prominent peatland conservation organisations, it is likely to be consulted when debating upland land use policy. Therefore, for the benefit of policymakers, we provide a point-by-point critical review of the "Burning and Peatlands" position statement. We also discuss several further points for researchers and policymakers to consider that are consistently ignored by those attempting to simplify the narrative about prescribed burning. Our aim in producing this discussion paper is to encourage the research and policy community to move towards an evidence-based position about prescribed burning impacts on UK peatlands.

   REINTRODUCTION
AB The moss layer transfer technique has been used since the 1990s to restore bogs in North America after peat extraction. This article assesses the influence of drainage-related, peat physicochemical, meteorological, management and landscape factors on the vegetation of extracted peatlands that have been restored in this manner. It draws upon data from a unique long-term monitoring programme covering 53 restoration projects spanning 600 km across eastern Canada. The time since restoration ranged from 3 to 15 years, and the rehabilitated peatlands had on average three permanent plots where vegetation was recorded every two years. Overall, the study included 246 permanent plots and 946 observations (plots*year of survey). Redundancy and cluster analyses showed that successful restoration, defined by the dominance of a Sphagnum carpet (54% of all plots at the most recent observation), was mainly associated with effective blocking of the former secondary drainage network within the restored sector, while plots dominated by bare peat (24% of all plots) occurred more often if a hot summer followed restoration works and where higher proportions of the surrounding land were subject to peat extraction. Management decisions, such as the season when restoration work was carried out, also substantially influenced restoration outcomes. For example, restoring in spring increased the likelihood of initiating an alternative successional trajectory characterised by dominance of the pioneer moss Polytrichum strictum (22% of all plots). However, a tendency towards Sphagnum colonisation and the development of Sphagnum carpets was observed over time in practically all plots. These results will inform future restoration efforts using the moss layer transfer as a peatland restoration method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Late Pleistocene landscape in northern Eurasia and North America was inhabited by a specific megafaunal complex, which largely disappeared during the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. Vegetation changes are considered as one of the factors responsible for these extinctions, but the structure and composition of the Pleistocene vegetation are still poorly known. Here we complement previous studies by comparing the taxonomic composition of the plant remains found in the gastrointestinal tracts of the frozen carcasses of Pleistocene megaherbivores with the species composition of the current Siberian vegetation. We compiled a dataset of palaeobotanical records from frozen individuals of Pleistocene megaherbivores found in northern Siberia and Beringia and dated to the period from more than 50 kyr BP to 9 kyr BP. We also compiled a dataset of vegetation plots from several regions in Siberia. We analysed the similarity in taxonomic composition of plants between these two datasets using a novel method that accounts for variable taxonomic resolution in palaeobotanical data. For most megaherbivore individuals, plant remains in their gastrointestinal tracts corresponded to tundra, forest and mire vegetation, while they showed low similarity to steppe. This pattern was relatively constant over time, showing no remarkable differences between the Last Glacial Maximum and the periods before and afterwards. This suggests that during the Upper Pleistocene, a mosaic of mesic and wet vegetation types such as tundra with patches of forests and mires was common in northern Siberia and Beringia. In contrast, the steppe was rare to absent in the landscape or underused by the megaherbivores as a pasture since they found enough food in the widespread mesic and wet habitats with more productive vegetation.

AB We measured CH4 flux at high temporal resolution with triplicate autochambers from three different plant communities at the ombrotrophic Mer Bleue bog in Canada to investigate the spatial and temporal variations, and factors that related to the CH4 flux. Our results show that seasonal mean CH4 fluxes from the Eriophorum-dominated community were 1.4-2.2 and 3.7-5.5 times higher than those from Maianthemum/Ledum and Chamaedaphne communities, respectively. Significant interannual variations in CH4 flux were observed in Maianthemum/Ledum and Chamaedaphne communities, attributable to a 55-60% reduction of mean summer (July-September) CH4 flux in 2010 as a consequence of a 5.5-9.0 cm lower mean summer water table compared to 2009. The Eriophorum community showed a much larger rate of increase in CH4 flux with peat temperature in the early growing season than in midsummer, which might be caused by a concomitant increase in root exudation of labile carbon for methanogenesis. Temporal variability of log-transformed CH4 flux was correlated (r0.4) with peat temperature only when water table was less than 20, 30, and 40 cm below the peat surface for Maianthemum/Ledum, Chamaedaphne, and Eriophorum communities, respectively. This difference in water table threshold among communities might partly be related to differences in rooting depth and hence the ability of plants to sustain CH4 flux in dry conditions. These results suggest that modeling of CH4 flux from ombrotrophic peatlands over time should take into account the role of different vegetation types, since the relationships between CH4 emissions and environmental factors vary among vascular plant communities.

AB The Nissi Fen is located in a 12 km2 intramontane basin in northwestern Greece. Since the last glacial, limnotelmatic and pure telmatic conditions, controlled mainly by karstic springs and partly by surface waters, favoured peat formation in the basin, resulting in the accumulation of a peat deposit up to 15 m thick. The present fen occupies a large area of almost 9 km2. Flora cover comprises mainly Cyperaceae (Cladium mariscus and Carex species), while Phragmites australis extend along the banks of a river flowing through the basin, as well as around a lake in the southern part of the fen. These species also contributed to the peat formation. The Nissi peatland shows many genetic similarities to the Philippi peat deposit, Eastern Macedonia. and may be considered as a recent analogue to the lignite deposits in the basins of Ptolemais, Western Macedonia and Megalopolis, the Peloponnese.

AB Peatlands are one of the largest terrestrial stores of carbon. Carbon exchange in peatlands is often assessed solely by measurement of contemporary fluxes; however, these fluxes frequently indicate a much stronger sink strength than that measured by the rate of C accumulation in the peat profile over longer timescales. Here we compare profile-based measurements of C accumulation with the published net ecosystem C balance for the largest peatland area in Britain, the Flow Country of northern Scotland. We estimate the long-term rate of C accumulation to be 15.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for a site where a recent eddy covariance study has suggested contemporary C uptake more than six times greater (99.37 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Our estimate is supported by two further long-term C accumulation records from nearby sites which give comparable results. We demonstrate that a strong contemporary C sink strength may not equate to a strong long-term sink and explore reasons for this disparity. We recommend that contemporary C sequestration should be viewed in the context of the long-term ecological drivers, such as fires, ecohydrological feedbacks and the changing quality of litter inputs.

AB Vascular-plant relict species Trichophorum pumilum has a disjunct distribution range and in Europe (not considering Caucasus and South Ural Mts) it currently occurs only in the Alps, Norway and a small area in the Western Carpathians. This study reviews all available data on the distribution and ecology of this species in Europe, provides vegetation and ecological characteristics of recent populations in the Western Carpathians and compares them with that found in other European regions. In the Western Carpathians this species is found in a small area in an Inner-Carpathian basin in northern Slovakia, the Liptov, Poprad and Hornad Basin, and rarely reaches the margins of adjacent mountains. It is currently present at 10 sites in this area. This species is therefore classified in the IUCN category "endangered". Occurrence of Trichophorum pumilum is associated with calcareous fens, usually those initiated during the late glacial and surrounded by extremely mineral-rich active travertine springs. Finds of macrofossils suggest that the species was more widespread in Europe and Slovakia during the last glacial. Currently this species occurs in communities of the Caricion davallianae alliance, associations Glauco-Trichophoretum pumili and Caricetum davallianae. Habitat and vegetation affinity differ substantially from that found at most other European localities of this species. The reasons for this difference are the specific ecological conditions of travertine springs and surrounding fens, which enabled the postglacial survival of this species at rather low altitudes in the temperate zone. One of the most important differences is the occurrence of halophytic and subhalophytic species at the Western-Carpathian localities, which makes their vegetation somewhat analogous to that of T pumilum fens found in the Russian Altai Mts. We demonstrate this similarity by detrended correspondence analysis of all available individual releves from the Carpathians, the Alps and Altai.

TI Scots pine radial growth response to climate and future projections at
   peat and mineral soils in the boreo-nemoral zone
SO THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID DIVERGENCE PROBLEM; INSIGHTS; BOGS
AB This paper aims to study what influence different meteorological parameters have on the radial tree growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in peat and mineral soils, as well as to make predictions of radial tree growth responses to changing climate based on various future climate projections. Four Lithuanian peatland complexes representing different geographical settings and hydrological conditions were studied. From each study site, two tree-ring width (TRW) series were derived, one from trees growing on peat soil and one from trees on mineral soil at the periphery of the peatland. The annual growth rings from trees grown on mineral soils, in different geographical regions in Lithuania, show synchronicity, whereas the correlation between the TRW series from different peatland sites was weak to absent. The main factor that explains radial tree growth at the mineral-soil sites was air temperature during early spring (February-March), which influences the onset and duration of the growing season. However, variations in radial tree growth on the peatland sites were also attributed to lagged hydrological responses relating to precipitation and evaporation over several years. Our future projections show that growth conditions for pine trees on mineral soils will improve in the twenty-first century in Lithuania following an increase of air temperature in early spring. The predictions for the trees growing on peat soils, however, rely on the groundwater-level changes governed by a combination of precipitation and evaporation changes. Towards the end of the twenty-first century, the groundwater level in most Lithuanian peatlands is expected to increase, which most likely will result in harsher growth conditions for the peatland trees. This assumption is, however, open for debate as the peatland trees appear to favour the current warming conditions. It may therefore be too early to precisely predict future growth responses for the peatland trees, but this study is a next step to better understand future climate dynamics and vegetation responses in the Baltic region.

ID FLOW; BOG
AB Peat specific yield (S-Y) is an important parameter involved in many peatland hydrological functions such as flood attenuation, baseflow contribution to rivers, and maintaining groundwater levels in surficial aquifers. However, general knowledge on peatland water storage capacity is still very limited, due in part to the technical difficulties related to in situ measurements. The objectives of this study were to quantify vertical S-Y variations of water tables in peatlands using the water table fluctuation (WTF) method and to better understand the factors controlling peatland water storage capacity. The method was tested in five ombrotrophic peatlands located in the St. Lawrence Lowlands (southern Quebec, Canada). In each peatland, water table wells were installed at three locations (up-gradient, mid-gradient, and down-gradient). Near each well, a 1-m long peat core (8 cm x 8 cm) was sampled, and subsamples were used to determine S-Y with standard gravitational drainage method. A larger peat sample (25 cm x 60 cm x 40 cm) was also collected in one peatland to estimate S-Y using a laboratory drainage method. In all sites, the mean water table depth ranged from 9 to 49 cm below the peat surface, with annual fluctuations varying between 15 and 29 cm for all locations. The WTF method produced similar results to the gravitational drainage experiments, with values ranging between 0.13 and 0.99 for the WTF method and between 0.01 and 0.95 for the gravitational drainage experiments. S-Y was found to rapidly decrease with depth within 20 cm, independently of the within-site location and the mean annual water table depth. Dominant factors explaining S-Y variations were identified using analysis of variance. The most important factor was peatland site, followed by peat depth and seasonality. Variations in storage capacity considering site and seasonality followed regional effective growing degree days and evapotranspiration patterns. This work provides new data on spatial variations of peatland water storage capacity using an easily implemented method that requires only water table measurements and precipitation data.

AB This study compares seasonal and spatial variations in methane fluxes as sources of uncertainty in regional CH4 flux upscaling from the wetlands of West Siberia. The study examined variability in summertime CH4 emissions from boreal peatlands, with a focus on two subtaiga fen sites in the southern part of West Siberia (Novosibirskaya oblast). We measured CH4 flux, water table depth, air and peat temperature, pH and electric conductivity of peat water during three field campaigns in summer 2011 (9-12 July, 26-28 July and 20-21 August). Fluxes were measured with static chambers at sites chosen to represent two of the most widespread types of wetlands for this climatic zone: soligenous poor fens and topogenous fens. In both sites the water table level acts as the primary control on fluxes. For the poor fen site with good drainage, water table controls CH4 fluxes on the seasonal scale but not on a local spatial scale; for the fen site with weak drainage and microtopographic relief, the water table controls fluxes on the local spatial scale, but does not drive seasonal variations in the flux magnitude. This difference in hydrology shows the necessity of including detailed wetland type classification schemes into large-scale modeling efforts. From these three measurement periods, we estimated the relative seasonal variation in CH4 emissions as 8% for the fen site and 26% for the poor fen site. These results were compared to estimates of other sources of uncertainty (such as interannual variation and spatial heterogeneity) to show that quantifying seasonal variability is less critical than these other variations for an improved estimate of regional CH4 fluxes. This research demonstrates and ranks the challenges in upscaling measured wetland CH4 fluxes across West Siberia and can guide future field campaigns.

To better understand the spatial heterogeneity in temperate peatland CH4 emissions and their response to physical and biological drivers, we studied CH4 dynamics throughout the growing seasons of 2017 and 2018 in Flatiron Lake Bog, a kettle-hole peat bog in Ohio. The site is composed of six different hydrobiological zones: an open water zone, four concentric vegetation zones surrounding the open water, and a restored zone connected to the main bog by a narrow channel. At each of these locations, we monitored water level (WL), CH4 pore-water concentration at different peat depths, CH4 fluxes from the ground and from representative plant species using chambers, and microbial community composition with a focus here on known methanogens and methanotrophs. Integrated CH4 emissions for the growing season were estimated as 315.4 +/- 166 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) in 2017 and 362.3 +/- 687 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) in 2018. Median CH4 emission was highest in the open water, then it decreased and became more variable through the concentric vegetation zones as the WL dropped, with extreme emission hotspots observed in the tamarack mixed woodlands (Tamarack) and low emissions in the restored zone (18.8-30.3 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). Generally, CH4 flux from above-ground vegetation was negligible compared to ground flux (< 0.4 %), although blueberry plants were a small CH4 sink. Pore-water CH4 concentrations varied significantly among zones, with the highest values in the Tamarack zone, close to saturation, and the lowest values in the restored zone. While the CH4 fluxes and pore-water concentrations were not correlated with methanogen relative abundance, the ratio of methanogens to methanotrophs in the upper portion of the peat was significantly correlated to CH4 transfer velocity (the CH4 flux divided by the difference in CH4 pore-water concentration between the top of the peat profile and the concentration in equilibrium with the atmosphere). Since ebullition and plant-mediated transport were not important sources of CH4 and the peat structure and porosity were similar across the different zones in the bog, we conclude that the differences in CH4 transfer velocities, and thus the flux, are driven by the ratio of methanogen to methanotroph relative abundance close to the surface. This study illustrates the importance of the interactions between water-level and microbial composition to better understand CH4 fluxes from bogs and wetlands in general.

AB Wildfire is the largest disturbance affecting northern peatlands; however, little is known about how burn severity (organic soil depth of burn) alters post-fire hydrological conditions that control the recovery of keystone peatland mosses (i.e. Sphagnum). For this reason, we assessed the impact of burn severity on moss water availability by measuring soil tension () and surface volumetric moisture content () in burned and unburned portions of a peatland complex 2years after fire. We found that both high and low burn severity decreased post-fire water availability by altering peat hydrophysical properties (moisture retention and water repellency). Locations covered by Sphagnum fuscum prior to fire exhibited a decreasing post-fire water availability with an increasing burn severity. In contrast, the lowest water availability (>400cm, <002) was observed in feather mosses that underwent low burn severity (residual branches identifiable). Deep burning (>020m) in peatland margins and burn depths >005m in the middle of the peatland exhibited the highest water availability (<60cm). Locations with low surface and high , notably feather mosses undergoing low burn severity, exhibited minimal moss recolonization. Such areas dominate post-fire surface cover (similar to 40%) within late successional (mature) peatlands or peatlands located in dry hydrological settings. We argue that such environments are under-represented in conceptual models of post-fire recovery. A new conceptual model is proposed in which (1) deep burning is counterbalanced by rapid recolonization and (2) pre-fire species interact with burn severity to produce substantial lags in post-fire moss recovery.

AB This study assessed the short-term impacts of ditch blocking on water table depth and vegetation community structure in a historically drained blanket bog. A chronosequence approach was used to compare vegetation near ditches blocked 5 years, 4 years and 1 year prior to the study with vegetation near unblocked ditches. Plots adjacent to and 3 m away from 70 ditches within an area of blanket bog were assessed for floristic composition, aeration depth using steel bars, and topography using LiDAR data. No changes in aeration depth or vegetation parameters were detected as a function of ditch blocking, time since blocking, or distance from the ditch, with the exception of non-Sphagnum bryophytes which had lower cover in quadrats adjacent to ditches that had been blocked for 5 years. Analysis of LiDAR data and the observed proximity of the water table to the peat surface led us to conclude that the subdued ecosystem responses to ditch-blocking were the result of historical peat subsidence within a 4-5 m zone either side of each ditch, which had effectively lowered the peat surface to the new, ditch influenced water table. We estimate that this process led to the loss of around 500,000 m(3) peat within the 38 km(2) study area following drainage, due to a combination of oxidation and compaction. Assuming that 50% of the volume loss was due to oxidation, this amounts to a carbon loss of 11,000 Mg C over this area, i.e. 3 Mg C ha(-1). The apparent 'self-rewetting' of blanket bogs in the decades following drainage has implications for their restoration as it suggests that there may not be large quantities of dry peat left to rewet, and that there is a risk of inundation (potentially leading to high methane emissions) along subsided ditch lines. Many peatland processes are likely to be maintained in drained blanket bog, including support of typical peatland vegetation, but infilling of lost peat and recovery of original C stocks are likely to take longer than is generally anticipated.

AB This study aims to understand the effects of recent tree encroachment on plant richness and diversity of Sphagnum-dominated bogs isolated in an agricultural landscape. A nested paired sampling design was used to compare plant species richness and beta diversity between open and forested habitats of 14 bogs in southern Quebec, Canada. We evaluated the impact of tree encroachment at regional and local scales (between and within bogs, respectively). Tree basal area, canopy openness and stand age were evaluated in forested habitats. We used permutation paired sample t-tests to compare species richness between open and forested sites. Beta diversity was calculated as between-site similarities in composition, and differences were evaluated using tests for homogeneity in multivariate dispersion. Forested habitats had greater species richness than open habitats due to enrichment by facultative and non-peatland species as well as by mid- and shade-tolerant vascular plants. At both scales, this species enrichment was associated with flora differentiation (increase of beta diversity), although at regional scale, this was true for bryophytes only. Tree basal area had a positive influence on forested habitats species richness. These compositional changes are expected to increase similarity between bog flora and upland vegetation, and consequently decrease regional diversity.

AB Domed restiad mires, i.e. restiad bogs, once widespread in the northern part of New Zealand, are today rare. The scarcity of these ecosystems means that understanding the effects of change on the bogs is essential if restiad ecosystems are to be preserved. Of three restiad bogs studied in the North Island of New Zealand, Kopouatai has been little affected by human influence while Moanatuatua and Whangamarino are being subjected to lowered local water tables and are surrounded by farmland. Examination of the physical peat characteristics of the bogs showed patterns of peat degradation within and between the bogs that can be attributed to both natural and anthropogenic influences. Natural influences result in a 'normal' pattern of peat degradation, the degree of degradation decreasing upwards in cores. Differences in sedimentary environment during peat accumulation have resulted in Moanatuatua peat becoming generally more degraded than Kopouatai peat. Recent anthropogenically influenced changes in water table and nutrient content of surface water have resulted in surficial degradation of peat at Moanatuatua and Whangamarino.

AB Peatlands and forested wetlands can cover a large fraction of the land area and contain a majority of the regional carbon pool in wet northern temperate landscapes. We used the LANDIS-II forest landscape succession model coupled with a model of plant community and soil carbon responses to water table changes to explore the impacts of declining water table on regional carbon pools in a peatland- and wetland-rich landscape in northern Wisconsin, USA. Simulations indicated that both biomass accumulation and soil decomposition would increase as a consequence of drying. In peatlands, simulated water table declines of 100 cm led to large increases in biomass as well as short-term increases in soil carbon, whereas declines of 40 cm led to continuous declines in soil carbon and smaller increases in biomass, with the net result being a loss of total carbon. In non-peat wetlands, biomass accumulation outweighed soil carbon loss for both scenarios. Long-term carbon cycle responses were not significantly affected by the time scale of water table decline. In general, peatland carbon storage over the first 50-150 years following drainage was neutral or increasing due to increased plant growth, whereas carbon storage over longer time scales decreased due to soil carbon loss. Although the simplicity of the model limits quantitative interpretation, the results show that plant community responses are essential to understanding the full impact of hydrological change on carbon storage in peatland-rich landscapes, and that measurements over long time scales are necessary to adequately constrain landscape carbon pool responses to declining water table.

AB Peat bogs have accumulated more atmospheric carbon (C) than any other terrestrial ecosystem today. Most of this C is associated with peat moss (Sphagnum) litter. Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition can decrease Sphagnum production, compromising the C sequestration capacity of peat bogs. The mechanisms underlying the reduced production are uncertain, necessitating multifactorial experiments.
   We investigated whether glasshouse experiments are reliable proxies for field experiments for assessing interactions between N deposition and environment as controls on Sphagnum N concentration and production. We performed a meta-analysis over 115 glasshouse experiments and 107 field experiments.
   We found that glasshouse and field experiments gave similar qualitative and quantitative estimates of changes in Sphagnum N concentration in response to N application. However, glasshouse-based estimates of changes in production even qualitative assessments diverged from field experiments owing to a stronger N effect on production response in absence of vascular plants in the glasshouse, and a weaker N effect on production response in presence of vascular plants compared to field experiments.
   Thus, although we need glasshouse experiments to study how interacting environmental factors affect the response of Sphagnum to increased N deposition, we need field experiments to properly quantify these effects.

AB Common objectives of afforestation of cut-away peatlands are the diminution of nutrition loads and the production of energy wood in an efficient and economic way. We studied the effect of fertilization and afforestation methods on the early establishment of downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) seedlings on a cut-away peatland. Six treatments of peat-ash, wood-ash, biotite, or PK-fertilizer were replicated in three blocks in different mixtures corresponding to 50 kg/ha of phosphorous. Birch seeds were sown in randomized halves of split plots, while other halves were naturally afforested. Natural afforestation was equal to sowing in terms of seedling amounts due to closeness of surrounding birch stands with abundant seed crops. After the first growing season the greatest quantities and dominant heights of birch seedlings appeared on the ash-fertilized plots, whereas on the unfertilized areas both the establishment and growth of seedlings was very poor. On the other hand, the quantity of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings was more than three times higher on the unfertilized areas compared to the ash-fertilized areas. The differences between the fertilized and the unfertilized areas accentuated during the four observation years. Our results support regular use of ash-fertilizers for the afforestation of cut-away peatlands instead of the ash being deposited as a waste in landfills. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Compared to boreal or Mediterranean biomes, the influence of fire on peatlands in Central Europe is not well studied. We aim to provide first analysis of statistically significant charcoal-inferred fire events from a peatland from central European lowlands, spanning the period of the last 650 years, and define peatland vegetation and microbial trait-related responses to local fire events. Here, we reconstructed regional and local fire activity from Bagno Kusowo bog (Poland) using high-resolution microscopic charcoal and macroscopic charcoal and its morphotypes, inferring past fire regimes using numeric analyses. We compared fire data with extra-local (pollen) and local (plant macrofossils, testate amoebae (TA) and their trait composition) proxies. Our data show that within the chronological uncertainties, regional fires recorded in the peat core coincide with historically-documented fires. Macroscopic charcoal analysis suggests 3-8 local fire events, while fire frequency varied between 0 and 2 events/1000 years. Wood charcoal was dominant throughout the profile, pointing to forest fires in close proximity to the peatland. Local fire activity was the most intensive in the 17th century, when the water table was at its lowest. The abundance of Sphagnum spp. declined, whereas vascular plants, mixotrophs and TA with proteinaceous shells were significantly positively correlated to fire. Xenosomes were significantly negatively correlated to fires, and they responded to water table lowering. We show that the peatlands' vegetation recovered from low-intensity and short-lasting disturbances and, to some extent, maintained "pristine" local vegetation cover with Sphagnum as the dominant taxon. TA traits common before disturbances, mainly mixotrophs and TA with proteinaceous shells, temporarily re-appeared after fire. We conclude that TA communities in peatlands are good bioindicators of disturbances. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Extensive cushions of Distichia muscoides found at high elevations in the Andes form deep deposits of peat and function as peatland. The location of Distichia peatlands at the highest elevations makes them susceptible to the effects of global change including global warming. Accumulation rates of organic matter are the key function of peatland ecosystems and are highly susceptible to changes in climate. This study used Pb-210 chronologies to infer the recent dynamics of three Distichia muscoides peatlands located above 4000m in elevation. Chronological markers from dated volcanic eruptions were correlated to the Pb-210 chronologies of Distichia peat and validated the Pb-210 chronologies. Changes in Pb-210 activity with depth indicated rapid accumulation in recent times. Organic matter had a mean accumulation rate of 1400gm(-2)yr(-1) during the past 10years, with values well above the observed regional accumulation rate of 300-400gm(-2)yr(-1). The same pattern was observed in peat accretion rates, with growth rates of 1-2cm per year during the last 10years. Cushion plants engineer their own environment, allowing the system to be less susceptible to direct changes in climate. However, the high rates of peat accretion in recent times may be originated from increasing temperatures and excess water from nearby glacier melt. However, glaciers are predicted to disappear during the next 20years in the northern Andes, reducing water inputs in tropical high-elevation ecosystems.

AB The role of peatlands in the global carbon cycle is confounded by two inconsistencies. First, peatlands have been a large reservoir for carbon sequestered in the past, but may be either net sources or net sinks at present. Second, long-term rates of peal accumulation (and hence carbon sequestration) are surprisingly steady despite great variability in the short-term rates of peat formation. Here, we present a feedback mechanism that can explain how fine-scale and short-term variability in peal-forming processes is constrained to give steady rates of pear accumulation over longer time-scales. The feedback mechanism depends on a humpbacked relationship between the rate of peal formation and the thickness of the aerobic surface layer (the acrotelm), such that individual microforms (hummocks, lawns, hollows and pools) expand or contract vertically in response to fluctuations in the position of the water table. Hummocks (but not hollows) 'evolve' to a steady slate where changes in acrotelm thickness compensate for climate-mediated variations in surface wetness. With long-term growth of a topographically confined peat deposit, the steady state gradually shifts to a thicker acrotelm (i.e. taller hummocks) and lower rates of peat formation and carbon sequestration.

AB Environmental and biological variables fluctuate over different time scales. On the basis of power spectral analysis of 14 time series at four sites from northern peatlands (fens and raised bogs), the temporal variability of physical environment (temperatures, water tables) and biological variables (CO2 flux) shows power-law behaviour, with a scaling exponent ranging from about 0.5 to 1.5. The scaling exponents of air temperatures change from 1.5 at high frequency to 0.5 at low frequency, with a break point at diurnal period. Comparison with similar analysis of temperature data from climate stations suggests that the atmosphere above peatlands has more active heat exchange with waterlogged peatlands than with upland terrestrial ecosystems. Water tables from different peatlands show almost identical power spectra, with a scaling exponent of 1.0 over all time scales. CO2 exchange has more complex spectral structure, with two break points at daily and monthly periods. This spectral structure suggests scale-dependent influence of climatic and hydrological fluctuations on CO2 fluxes. CO2 flux responds to air temperature with a distinct diurnal spectral peak. These results indicate that time scales are important in discussing hydrology and carbon dynamics in peatlands, and that scaling up of short-term experimental results may be inadvisable. Further statistical analysis on drained and harvested peatlands would provide insights into understanding shift in peatland dynamics due to human disturbance. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB (Characterisation of Sanguinhal Mire, Terceira Island (Azores): a protected quaking bog habitat). The Azores archipelago in the North Atlantic is an important area for biodiversity because it is rich in rare species and habitats, and almost undisturbed. Sanguinhal mire was originally a lake that evolved through paludification into a peat habitat. It is located inside Nature 2000 (European Union for Protection of Nature and Biodiversity, Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, Habitat Directive Annex 1(b) habitat 7140) area of Santa Barbara and Pico Alto Mountains on the island of Terceira, and it is a good example of a basin peatland type that was first discovered in 1998. This paper provides baseline information on its flora, vegetation communities, structure, surface hydrology and chemistry. Forty-one plant species including six Sphognum species and ten endemic vascular plants have been recorded, and eight plant communities are distinguished. The maximum peat depth is 2.5 m. The mire receives flowing water from its margins, in addition to intercepted precipitation and fog. After precipitation, water drains through several placic rupture points. Both pH and water conductivity were measured, with some ecological tendencies observed. The conservation status of the mire is good, but it is subject to increasing pressure from cattle pasture and a walking trail that constrains natural surface water movement.

AB Drainage and peat extraction may have a negative impact on existing hydrological conditions and, consequently, on the conditions of wetland ecosystems. The aim of this study was to assess human impact on the studied Trzcinskie Mokradla Peatland by comparing the concentrations and trace element (Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr and Ni) pools in the study area (extracted vs. non-extracted areas of peatland). The concentration of trace elements in organic soils and their pools were analysed in relation to their depth in the soil profiles, content of organic matter, soil pH values and the degree of decomposition of organic materials (peat, mursh). Fifteen soil profiles (90 samples) were examined. The total soil elements content was determined after digestion in a mixture of HCl+HNO3. The element pools were calculated and expressed in g m(-2) of soil in 0-30 cm and 30-50 cm layers. Soils showed acidic or slightly acidic reactions. The high concentrations of Pb and Zn were mainly observed in the upper horizons. The deeper layers enriched with mineral fractions were also enriched in metals like Cr and Ni.

AB Radiocarbon and pollen analytical dates of 71 basal-peat samples from 23 sites in the Boreal region of southern Finland were used to reconstruct patterns of peat initiation and the subsequent spread of peat during the Holocene. Only mires known for certain as having originated through paludification were considered. Three new sites (Isosuo, Tremanskarr and Kantosuo) were investigated in detail by means of stratigraphic, biostratigraphic and morphometric analyses; other material was collected from existing written sources. The first peats began accumulating in the region about 10 700 cal. BP. Two distinct phases of more intensive peat initiation, followed by subsequent spread, were recognized: c. 8000-7300 cal. BP and from c. 4300 cal. BP onwards (mainly 4300-3000 cal. BP). This pattern may well reflect the increased humidity at those points in time, and show a striking similarity to the pattern of change in lake levels in southern Sweden. In all cases the peat initiation was evidently governed not only by climate but by a wealth of internal and external factors, complicating the evaluation of past influences of climate. However, results demonstrate the potential of basal peats as a source of proxy climatic data.

AB In Schleswig-Holstein, the change of fen vegetation on peaty soils in the last decades is characterized by the development of Calthion vegetation types into species-poor Ranunculo-Alopecuretum geniculati caused by intensive agricultural use. Within the scope of the projekt, ''Ecosystem Research in the Vicinity of Bornhoeveder chain of lakes'', the seasonal dynamics of phytomass and nutrients of extensively used Ranunculo-Alopecuretum stands were observed with respect to the possibility of regeneration to species-rich wet meadows. Floristic observations revealed that throughout a period of five years with annual hay-making without fertilization, no characteristic species of wet meadows have established themselves. This indicates that the environmental conditions have not effectively changed yet. The high production of above-ground stand phytomass indicates yet a good availability of nutrients, especially of nitrogen. The dynamics of nitrogen yield in the above-ground phytomass showed that in order to achieve an efficient impoverishment of soil nutrients, it is necessary to cut the vegetation at least twice a year. Additionally, this management practice interferes positively with the structure of the plant composition.
   The success of restoration moreover depends on the biotic potential (recent vegetation, neighbouring vegetation, seed bank). In the investigated vegetation types the seed bank contains no characteristic species of wet meadows. Therefor apart from suitable management practices. a successful restoration of species-poor Ranunculo-Alopecuretum requires much more time.

AB 1. Discoloration of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tape has been used in peatland ecological and hydrological studies as an inexpensive way to monitor changes in water-table depth and reducing conditions.
   2. We investigated the relationship between depth of PVC tape discoloration and measured water-table depth at monthly time steps during the growing season within nine kettle peatlands of northern Wisconsin. Our specific objectives were to: (1) determine if PVC discoloration is an accurate method of inferring water-table depth in Sphagnum-dominated kettle peatlands of the region; (2) assess seasonal variability in the accuracy of the method; and (3) determine if systematic differences in accuracy occurred among microhabitats, PVC tape colour and peatlands.
   3. Our results indicated that PVC tape discoloration can be used to describe gradients of water-table depth in kettle peatlands. However, accuracy differed among the peatlands studied, and was systematically biased in early spring and late summer/autumn. Regardless of the month when the tape was installed, the highest elevations of PVC tape discoloration showed the strongest correlation with midsummer (around July) water-table depth and average water-table depth during the growing season.
   4. The PVC tape discoloration method should be used cautiously when precise estimates are needed of seasonal changes in the water-table.

AB We used pollen and grain-size data from a peat bog in Xiansan, Fujian Province, southeastern China, to reconstruct a high-resolution record of vegetation change, climatic dynamics, and human impact over the last 1330 cal BP. During 1330-1200 cal BP, we infer the existence of a swamp bog with dense cypress forests, based on dominant Cupressaceae pollen, suggesting cold and dry conditions during this early period. Fine-grained sediment and higher percentages of wetland pollen and fern spores suggest intermittent-lake conditions, indicating a wet Medieval Warm Period (MWP; 1200-730 cal BP). The increase in coniferous forest and montane shrub-meadow pollen indicate a cold and dry climate during the early to mid-Little Ice Age (LIA; 730-370 cal BP), but coarse-grained sediments associated with more abundant wetland taxa pollen indicate a shallower intermittent-lake landscape, reflecting relatively humid periods during 620-560 cal BP and 400-450 cal BP. During the last 370 cal BP, a rapid increase in the secondary forest component and a gradual decrease in the pollen-inferred floristic diversity index suggest that the natural vegetation was converted to secondary vegetation, as a result of severe anthropogenic disturbance in the montane region of Fujian Province. The reconstructed regional precipitation trend prior to this period was mainly correlated with East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) intensity, which is related to variation in solar irradiation.

AB The carbon budget dynamics of peatlands plays a crucial role in both the response of peatland ecosystems to environmental change and the effect of environmental change on peatlands. Studies on northern peatlands have suggested that the reliable assessment of the carbon budget must include the carbon flux at the land-stream interface. But this argument has not been proved in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the world's largest alpine system. To address the knowledge gap, in the growing season (May to October) of 2016, we chose Riganqiao peatland, a typical peatland in the Zoige Basin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau which has been intensely drained via ditches since the 1960s. The objective of this study was to measure the organic carbon export from ditches, and to estimate what proportion of the carbon budget can be attributed to this export. Results showed that, during the growing season in 2016, total organic carbon flux in ditches was 2,345 t (8.6 g m(-2)), of which particulate organic carbon accounted for 12% and dissolved organic carbon for 88%. This flux decreased the carbon budget of Riganqiao peatland by 11.2% (from +76.8 g m(-2) to +68.2 g m(-2)), making it a weakened carbon sink. This result revealed that organic carbon export from ditches plays an important role in the carbon balance in peatland of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB Sphagnum mosses contribute to the long-term carbon sequestration of many northern peatlands. Variability in both Sphagnum and peatland CO2 exchange is strongly influenced by water availability, but there is limited work examining the links between these relationships, particularly in a field setting. In this study, the effects of varying moss water content (WC), through precipitation exclusion (PE) and water addition (WA) treatments, on net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and component fluxes were assessed during a single growing season at Mer Bleue bog, a temperate ombrotrophic peatland. CO2 exchange by Sphagnum, vascular plants, and the total ecosystem were measured in situ using chambers. On average, the hummock species of Sphagnum dominant at the site maintained WCs within the optimal range for photosynthesis in all treatments and no treatment effect on CO2 exchange was observed. However, in a few samples associated with below optimal WCs, Sphagnum photosynthesis was reduced. Water table (WT) depth and direct precipitation were both important controls on Sphagnum WC, suggesting that frequent small rain events may be important in maintaining Sphagnum WC. This study only explored one variable associated with drought conditions (i.e. water availability through intercepted precipitation). Consequently, further study is necessary to assess the relative importance of deep WT positions and high temperatures on moss WC. Nevertheless, the results of this study suggest that decreased Sphagnum photosynthesis has the potential to influence peatland CO2 uptake at Mer Bleue in drought years, but only if moss WC is reduced below the optimal range.

ID SPHAGNUM REGENERATION; CUTOVER BOG; PEATLAND; MOISTURE; QUEBEC
AB Large-scale peat harvesting operations alter hydrology of raised bogs so that natural regeneration may not occur without altering the water table. This paper describes efforts to restore key hydrologic and ecologic processes in a southwest BC raised bog (Burns Bog) highly disturbed by decades of peat extraction, drainage, filling, and conversion to agriculture, urban, and industrial uses. The restoration goals are to return a high water table throughout the bog, but particularly in the pine forests at the edge of the bog, to re-establish Sphagnum cover, and to re-start the peat-forming process in degraded peat-harvested sectors. Peripheral and interior ditches are being blocked to increase the retention of winter precipitation into the drier summer months. Piezometer/well measurements have detected water table increases in the past two years, including a relatively immediate response in one site. New Sphagnum colonies have become established in the dry perimeter forest, a first indication that the water table may be rising and that peat-forming vegetation may be responding positively. These preliminary results suggest that it is possible to detect a rapid hydrological response with a comprehensive monitoring net-work in raised bogs; this observation is key to early prediction of future peatland restoration initiatives.

AB Three radiocarbon-dated pollen diagrams are presented from Holocene peat and lake deposits in Snowdonia, close to the Late Iron Age/Romano-British ironworking hill-fort of Bryn y Castell, Gwynedd, in upland north Wales. This paper discusses pollen, charcoal and peat-stratigraphic evidence for major local vegetation changes and for the development of the surrounding cultural landscape during the last 10 000 radiocarbon yr. Pollen data from one of the sites (BYC 2) provided a vegetational record for most of the Holocene. The early part of the sequence suggests an oligotrophic lake in a landscape that is being colonized by birch-pine woodland; later, mixed deciduous woodland surrounds an infilling lake basin. Dating of peat deposits at two of the sites (BYC, BYC H) indicated that their pollen records commenced between 5500 and 5000 yr sp. By this time, the lake basin was fringed by alder carr. There followed a gradual and then, c. 2700 yr sp, a more abrupt decline in woodland, such that, by the end of the Bronze Age and with the basin largely terrestrialized, the local landscape became dominated by mire vegetation communities, which have persisted to the present. Human activity seems to have been a major factor in the loss of woodland cover. Although there is some circumstantial evidence for earlier phases of human disturbance at BYC 2, human activity becomes increasingly apparent from c. 5000 yr BP. During the mid Holocene, the impact of Neolithic and early- to mid-Bronze Age cultures appears to be characterized by temporary woodland clearances, for arable and pastoral agriculture. By c. 2700 yr sp the majority of woodland cover seems to have been permanently removed from the landscape, but as there is scant archaeological evidence for late Bronze Age cultures in this part of Snowdonia, other factors, especially climate change, could be implicated. During the late Holocene, especially during part of the late Iron Age and Romano-British period, remaining local stands of woodland seem to have been exploited for iron smelting, although the overall impact of ironworking was limited.

AB The peatland ecosystems of Central Asia have received little attention from scientific research to date. In the continental, predominantly semi-arid to arid climate of Kyrgyzstan they represent rare biotopes that are crucial for maintaining special ecosystem functions within the vulnerable mountain areas. In this study, we present an assessment of the distribution and total area of peatlands in Kyrgyzstan derived from Soviet topographic maps. About 64,500 ha of peatlands were detected after digitizing special wetland signatures from maps at a scale of 1:100,000. The relevance of these signatures was tested with ground truth data and in most cases these signatures matched with peatlands.
   Ground truth data were collected for 13 peatlands, and brief descriptions of the vegetation and soil characteristics for these peatlands are provided. A gradient from plains to high mountains was detected with regard to peat thickness, each associated with their own distinct plant communities. Greatest peat (average 64 cm thick) accumulation occurred at low altitudes (<1000 m a.s.l.) and the thinnest peat (average 14 cm) occurred at high altitudes (above 3500 m a.s.l.). By combining data on the total area of peatlands with results from laboratory analysis of soil samples, we were able to investigate the potential carbon storage of peatlands in Kyrgyzstan. Depending on the location and peatland type, we found levels of carbon storage equating to 152 to 465 tons carbon per hectare, which scales up to an estimated national carbon storage equating to c.16.4 Mt for the entire country.

AB Radiocarbon dating and macrofossil data from a palsa and a filled thermokarst pond within a subarctic permafrost peatland were used to reconstruct their evolution and to distinguish between allogenic and autogenic processes that had been involved in their development. Peat began to accumulate in the peatland basin shortly after 6000 cal. BP. The initial stage was a shallow bay or a salty marsh, followed by a wet marsh triggered by a relatively rapid drop in sea level related to a rapid isostatic uplift of land. By 5640 cal. BP, the site had transformed into a rich fen. A high rate of peat accumulation led to the establishment of a short-lived intermediate fen by 4610 cal. BP and to a poor fen from 4200 cal. BP until 1760 cal. BP. Low water-tables associated with decreased precipitation occurred between 5170 and 4610 cal. BP, and 3100 and 1760 cal. BP. Between 1760 and the Little Ice Age, there was ombrotrophication of the site largely as a result of a thick peat accumulation. During this period, autogenic processes had controlled the general hydrosere, while allogenic processes, mainly precipitation, had influenced species composition. Permafrost established during the Little Ice Age leading to palsa formation and it has been melting in response to recent climate warming and precipitation increases. Macrofossil results from the filled thermokarst pond show that plant succession used the followed hydrosere: Calliergon giganteum and Sphagnum riparium when the pond's depth was at a maximum, S. riparium and C. giganteum when the pond was partly filled in, and S. lindbergii and S. riparium since the pond has been completely filled in.

AB Calcareous fens are species-rich peatlands that are dependent on minerotrophic water sources for wetland functioning, with current conceptual models suggesting the water source is ubiquitously groundwater upwelling. By quantifying the water balance and subsurface water flow paths and fluxes over 3 growing seasons for calcareous fens in 3 different hydrogeomorphic settings (Riparian, Trough, and Basin), we show evidence that challenges this conceptual model. The Riparian Fen received an order of magnitude more water inputs than the Trough or Basin Fens and was dominated by stream recharge inputs and groundwater outputs. Precipitation and evaporation dominated the water balance of the Trough Fen whereas only the Basin Fen received sizeable groundwater inputs. Indeed, subsurface water fluxes were low at all fens due to weak hydraulic gradients and low saturated hydraulic conductivity in some areas of each wetland, though variations in growing season precipitation led to subsurface flow reversals in all 3 fens. Our results demonstrate the importance of understanding landscape position, or hydrogeomorphic setting, on calcareous fen hydrology for improving conservation, management, and restoration efforts of these important ecosystems.

AB Peatlands typically act as carbon sinks, however, increasing wildfire severity and annual area burned may challenge this carbon sink status. Whilst most peat resistance to wildfire and drought research is based on deep peatlands that rarely lose their water table below the peat profile, shallow peatlands and peat deposits may be most vulnerable to high peat burn severity and extensive carbon loss. To examine the role of pre-fire peat depth on peat burn severity, we measured the depth of burn (DOB) in peat of varying depths (0.1-1.6 m) within a rock barrens landscape. We found that DOB (0-0.4 m) decreased with increasing pre-fire peat depth, and that there was a strong correlation between the percent of the profile that burned and pre-fire peat depth. Breakpoint analysis indicates a threshold depth of 0.66 m where deeper peat deposits experienced little impact of wildfire, whereas shallower peat typically experienced high peat burn severity (median percent burned = 2.2 and 65.1, respectively). This threshold also corresponded to the loss of the water table in some nearby unburned peatlands, where water table drawdown rates were greater in shallower peat. We suggest that peat depth may control peat burn severity through feedbacks that regulate water table drawdown. As such, we argue that the identification of a critical peat depth threshold could have important implications for wildfire management and peatland restoration aiming to protect vulnerable carbon stores.

AB Because anthropogenic stressors have caused degradation of the Kushiro Mire, in subarctic northern Japan, seen as drying and invasion of alder-dominant shrub forest, the Japanese government recently started a project to restore a meandering former river channel and so diminish the shrub forest and recover the mire ecosystem. This paper describes the further development of the National Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology (NICE) model with surface-unsaturatedsaturated water processes and land-surface processes assimilated with satellite data to include mutual interaction and feedback of hydrogeologic and vegetation dynamics in the mire. NICE iteratively simulated hydrologic cycle, elevation change, and vegetation succession, including the competition between two vegetation types (alder-dominant shrub forest and reedsedge vegetation), to evaluate nonlinear relationship between drying and alder invasion in the mire and to examine a method for mire recovery. NICE reproduced well the heterogeneous alder invasion in the mire, implying that the study made some progress in explaining the positive feedback between geomorphology and eco-hydrology on irregular slopes and in heterogeneous vegetation, whereas most previous studies have considered regular slopes and their relation to string or maze patterns. Simulation results predicted that restoring meanders to the river channel would decrease the discharge and sediment loading of the river, increase the groundwater level downstream, and achieve a degree of mire recovery in the future. The heterogeneous vegetation succession is discussed in relation to regime shift in transient simulation. These results suggest the effectiveness of river restoration in conservation plans for mire recovery, and the importance of the process-based model in assessing the linkage of hydrological change and vegetation succession.

AB In Chlebowo mire (Wielkopolska region), we investigated testate amoebae in relation to 10 environmental parameters in the semi-natural floating vegetation of flooded peat workings. The measured parameters included: depth to water table (DWT), ground-water pH, color, conductivity, PO4, NO3, NH4, SO4, Ca, and Mg. Detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to analyze relations between the composition of testate amoebae communities and those variables. In canonical correspondence analysis, DWT, pH, and Mg remained after forward-selection as the main factors characterizing the changes in testate amoebae communities along the moisture and nutrient gradients. Characteristic species of testate amoebae for the various stages of floating-mat development in the flooded peat workings were distinguished. Communities of testate amoebae along with present-day vegetation reflect the process of progressive acidification, driven mainly by Sphagnum fallax. We consider this as secondary succession, since preliminary investigations of peat stratigraphy revealed sedge peat below no more than 5-40 cm of Sphagnum peat in undisturbed parts of the mire. This study increases our understanding of relationships between testate amoebae and their habitat, which is valuable for palaeoenvironmental studies. A local transfer function was developed with the use of six models: partial least squares, maximum likelihood, modern analogue technique, weighted averaging, tolerance down-weighted averaging, and weighted averaging-partial least squares. The weighted averaging model performed the best for depth to water table (root mean square error of prediction RMSEP = 6.99) and pH (RMSEP = 0.8). Results will be used as part of a regional training set to improve palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of Sphagnum peatlands.

AB Peatlands are major terrestrial stores of carbon (C) of importance to the global climate system. Recent studies have made progress in understanding the climatic controls on the C cycle; however, important interactions between volcanic deposition and peatland C stores remain to be addressed. This study uses a 3000-year peatland record from northern Japan to examine the interactions between carbon accumulation, vegetation community succession and volcanic ash deposition. Plant macrofossil and testate amoebae records are presented alongside records of total organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous. Age-depth models are developed using a Bayesian approach, with seven AMS radiocarbon dates and two identified historical tephras from Baitoushan (AD 969 (981 cal. BP)), and Hokkaido-Komagatake (AD 1640 (310 cal. BP)) volcanoes. Results show that moderate to high tephra loading can shift peatland plant communities from Sphagnum to monocotyledon domination. This vegetation change is associated with increased peat humification and reduced carbon accumulation. Where tephra deposition and reworking has occurred, the apparent rate of carbon accumulation can be halved while high tephra loading of the mire surface is sustained. Sphagnum species vary in their tolerance to tephra deposition. After each ash fall Sphagnum magellanicum disappeared from the plant macrofossil record, whereas Sphagnum papillosum showed apparent continuity of development through the 1856 (94 cal. BP) Ko-c1 tephra. High rates of carbon accumulation (peaking at >100 g m(-2) yr(-1)), 2-3 times faster than the average for northern peatlands, were recorded in the Sphagnum communities that established after the cessation of tephra deposition and reworking from the AD 969 Baitoushan ash fall (B-Tm tephra). This peak in C accumulation was coincident with a radical shift in mire nutrient cycling most probably caused by the interaction of S. magellanicum with leachates from the underlying tephras. The phase of high C accumulation continued for over 300 years, offsetting the initial negative impact of the B-Tm tephra on peatland C accumulation. These results suggest that management for ash-tolerant Sphagnum species could be a highly effective strategy for minimising volcanic disruption to peatland carbon accumulation. The study also shows that consideration of volcanic impacts on peatlands is essential for development of more realistic terrestrial carbon balance models in volcanically active regions.

AB Peatlands in northern latitudes sequester one third of the world's soil organic carbon. Mineral dusts can affect the primary productivity of terrestrial systems through nutrient transport but this process has not yet been documented in these peat-rich regions. Here we analysed organic and inorganic fractions of an 8900-year-old sequence from Store Mosse (the "Great Bog") in southern Sweden. Between 5420 and 4550 cal yr BP, we observe a seven-fold increase in net peat-accumulation rates corresponding to a maximum carbon-burial rate of 150 g C m(-2) yr(-1) -more than six times the global average. This high peat accumulation event occurs in parallel with a distinct change in the character of the dust deposited on the bog, which moves from being dominated by clay minerals to less weathered, phosphate and feldspar minerals. We hypothesize that this shift boosted nutrient input to the bog and stimulated ecosystem productivity. This study shows that diffuse sources and dust dynamics in northern temperate latitudes, often overlooked by the dust community in favour of arid and semi-arid regions, can be important drivers of peatland carbon accumulation and by extension, global climate, warranting further consideration in predictions of future climate variability.

AB Plant succession triggered by drainage, which results in the expansion or invasion of vascular plants, has been reported from many peatlands. However, the effects of the vascular plant's expansion on evapotranspiration (ET), which is a key component of the water balance of ombrotophic bog, are still contradictory. To investigate the effects, ET was measured at a Sphagnum-dominated bog and an adjacent transition peatland dominated by Sasa, dwarf bamboo, in Hokkaido Island, northern Japan, using the eddy covariance technique during the four growing seasons from 2007 through 2010. Cumulative gap-filled ET during a snow-free period of 6.5 months was 362(2008) and 374 mm (2010) at the Sphagnum site and 300 (2008) and 372 mm (2010) at the Sasa site. In the mid-growing season (late June to mid-September) with the highest leaf area index (LAI) at the Sasa site, ET was 2.14 +/- 0.03 (mean 1 standard deviation of the four years) and 1.92 +/- 0.19 mm d(-1), respectively, at the Sphagnum and Sasa sites. ET was smaller at the Sasa site, except for 2010 with an unusual hot wet summer; mean air temperature and precipitation were higher than their 30-year normal values by 1.75 degrees C and 172 mm, respectively. At the Sphagnum site, ET was stable despite such interannual variation in meteorological conditions. However, ET increased significantly at the Sasa site in 2010 probably because of LAI increase due to the enhanced growth of Sasa plants. The ET increase at the Sasa site suggests that ET will increase at the Sasa-dominated area, if the future warming environment accompanies more precipitation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the Athabasca Oil Sands Region in northeastern Alberta, Canada, oil sands operators are testing the feasibility of peatland construction on the post-mining landscape. In 2009, Syncrude Canada Ltd. began construction of the 52 ha Sandhill Fen pilot watershed, including a 15 ha, hydrologically managed fen peatland built on sand-capped soft oil sands tailings. An integral component of fen reclamation is post construction monitoring of water quality, including salinity, fluvial carbon, and priority pollutant elements. In this study, the effects of fen reclamation and elevated sulfate levels on mercury (Hg) fate and transport in the constructed system were assessed. Total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in the fen sediment were lower than in two nearby natural fens, which may be due to the higher mineral content of the Sandhill Fen peat mix and/or a loss of Hg through evasion during the peat harvesting, stockpiling and placement processes. Porewater MeHg concentrations in the Sandhill Fen typically did not exceed 1.0 ng L-1. The low MeHg concentrations may be a result of elevated porewater sulfate concentrations (mean 346 mg L-1) and an increase in sulphide concentrations with depth in the peat, which are known to suppress MeHg production. Total Hg and MeHg concentrations increased during a controlled mid-summer flooding event where the water table rose above the ground surface in most of the fen. The Hg dynamics during this event showed that hydrologic fluctuations in this system exacerbate the release of THg and MeHg downstream. In addition, the elevated SO42- concentrations in the peat porewaters may become a problem with respect to downstream MeHg production once the fen is hydrologically connected to a larger wetland network that is currently being constructed.

AB Peatlands surrounding Hudson and James Bays form the second largest peatland complex in the world and contain major stores of soil carbon (C). This study utilized a transect of eight ombrotrophic peat cores from remote regions of central and northern Ontario to quantify the magnitude and rate of C accumulation since peatland initiation and for the past 2000 calendar years before present (2 ka). These new data were supplemented by 17 millennially resolved chronologies from a literature review covering the Boreal Shield, Hudson Plains, and Taiga Shield bordering Hudson and James Bays. Peatlands initiated in central and northern Ontario by 7.8 ka following deglaciation and isostatic emergence of northern areas to above sea level. Total C accumulated since inception averaged 109.7 +/- (std. dev.) 36.2 kg C m(-2). Approximately 40% of total. soil C has accumulated since 2 ka at an average apparent rate of 20.2 +/- 6.9 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The 2 ka depths correlate significantly and positively with modern gridded climate estimates for mean annual precipitation, mean annual air temperature, growing degree-days > 0 degrees C, and photosynthetically active radiation integrated over days > 0 degrees C. There are significantly shallower depths in permafrost peatlands. Vertical peat accumulation was likely constrained by temperature, growing season length, and photosynthetically active radiation over the last 2 ka in the Hudson Bay Lowlands and surrounding regions.

AB 1 Significant areas of temperate bogs have been damaged by peat harvesting but may regenerate. These secondary mires, if well managed, may act as strong C sinks, regulate hydrology and buffer regional climate.
   2 The potential effects of bog regeneration will, however, depend on the successful establishment of the principal peat formers - Sphagnum mosses. The influence of hydrology and microclimate on Sphagnum re-growth is well studied but effects of elevated CO2 and N deposition are not known.
   3 We carried out two in-situ experiments in a cutover bog during three growing seasons in which we raised either CO2 (to 560 p.p.m.) or N (by adding NH4NO3, 3 g m(-2) year(-1)). The two treatments had contrasting effects on competition between the initial coloniser Polytrichum strictum (favoured by high N) and the later coloniser Sphagnum fallax (favoured by high CO2).
   4 Such changes may have important consequences for bog regeneration and hence for carbon sequestration in cutover bogs, with potential feedback on regional hydrological and climatic processes.

AB Organic matter decomposition in response to thawing permafrost has critical implications for carbon release. This study examined how thaw induced plant community and environmental changes influenced litter and peat decomposition in a subarctic peatland.
   We conducted laboratory incubations under current site pre-thaw (dry and large oxic peat layer) and thawed (wet and small oxic peat layer) conditions, and mimiced pond thaw conditions (water saturated and anoxic) at 4 and 22 A degrees C. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) releases from ground surface plant litter and top 1 m peat samples at permafrost area (Palsa) and wet thawed lawn (WL) were quantified under current site conditions. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released from litter was additionally quantified under pond thaw conditions.
   Plant litter mass significantly increased from Palsa to WL. Under current site conditions, litter in WL had significantly higher CO2 and CH4 production rates than litter in Palsa. Pond thaw conditions changed litter carbon loss partitioning into lower CO2 but higher DOC and CH4 production, and increased total carbon release. Whole peat decomposition was restricted from Palsa to WL with thaw. Estimated growing season gas carbon loss (CO2 and CH4) in WL was greater than that in Palsa due to significantly increased litter carbon loss after thaw.
   Changes in organic matter decomposition, especially litter decomposition, enlarged carbon losses from this subarctic peatland with permafrost thaw.

ID BOG
AB Exploitation of peatlands results in the degradation of hydrophysical conditions suitable for the re-establishment of peat-forming vegetation, notably Sphagnum mosses. Regeneration of peat-forming mosses necessitates a high and stable water table. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of open water reservoirs constructed to improve the hydrologic conditions required for growth of Sphagnum. A section of abandoned peatland, where former drainage ditches have been blocked, was treated by excavating reservoir ditches at 3-, 5-, and 8-m intervals to increase the local water storage. The colonization of Sphagnum fuscum and S. angustifolium diaspores scattered on the experimental baulks between the reservoir ditches was measured. Results indicate that water storage increased at the experimental site. The water table was higher and more stable, with an average maximum depth of 0.46 m at the rewetted site compared to 0.55 m at the control site. The volumetric moisture content of the surface peat was improved by rewetting, showing an average of 62% compared to 55% at the control site. Negative soil water tension at the -0.1 m depth was ameliorated at the experimental sites and nearly eliminated where 5-m experimental ditch-reservoir spacing was employed. Sphagnum establishment was successful on all experimental baulks, showing a higher percentage cover where soil moisture was more readily available.

AB Sediments deposited in fen carr environments are frequently used in pollen-based reconstructions of vegetation history, although few studies of modem pollen-vegetation relationships in fen carr have been undertaken to aid the interpretation of fossil assemblages. It is often assumed that the wetland pollen signal will reflect the overall composition of the fen carr system although, given the closed canopy context, it may actually be dominated by local vegetation elements. This paper seeks to determine whether the vegetation heterogeneity within a modem fen carr is reflected in the pollen signal of the wetland taxa. Vegetation composition was recorded around a series of moss polster sample points at Calthorpe and Wheatfen, two areas of fen carr in the Norfolk Broadland, UK. The spatial interrelationship between the wetland components of the vegetation and their palynological equivalents in the moss polster pollen assemblages is explored through trend surfaces and a correlation based statistical test (the Mantel Test). The representation of the major vegetation components in the pollen record is highly variable. Values for Alnus glutinosa, a dominant canopy species, range from 5.3% to 73% of total land pollen (TLP) at Calthorpe and 2.5-61% TLP at Wheatfen. In part, this variation reflects the enhanced input of pollen from dry land sources close to the wetland edge although the variation recorded at points equidistant from the dry land margin suggests that other processes are also influential. The strongest positive associations in the Mantel Test are for under-storey and ground flora elements that are poorly represented in the pollen record. Taxa for which there is no association include those with few vegetation occurrences and those for which a large proportion of the pollen appears to have been derived from outside the study areas. We conclude that modem pollen samples collected from fen carr broadly reflect the vegetation composition of the study areas. However, the input of pollen from fen carr species is spatially inconsistent. Differences between the sample points can be attributed to the distribution and pollination biology of the under-storey and ground flora elements and the structure of the vegetation around sites. The results caution against assuming that changes in the pollen representation of wetland taxa, in fossil sequences constructed from fen carr deposits, necessarily reflect changes in the overall composition of the community.

AB Globally, considerable carbon (C) is stored in soils, particularly in peatlands. These stores play a potentially significant role in atmospheric C-cycle feedbacks, and thus need to be accounted for in global models. However, present global soil models do not accurately represent peat C-stocks and -dynamics; thus, their climate-soil C feedback predictions are questionable. A major shortcoming of current models that are based on the decomposition of soil C pools is the lack of representation of long-term (non-equilibrium) soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation, as peat cohorts, with cohort age information. Whereas C-pool models are commonly 'spun up' to equilibrium over several hundred years using an average climate, in nature, soils actually evolve over many thousands of years with associated changes in litter amounts and quality, which affect SOC accumulation, and hence peat formation. Secondly, peat soils have a unique hydrology, and changes in the water table depth (WTD) of peat are important in regulating SOC turnover, yet current non-cohort C pool models fail to include such dynamic hydrological processes. We have developed an improved peat age-cohort model called MILLENNIA, with a variable WTD driving C-dynamics during Holocene peat accumulation, allowing validation with peat age data and the testing of a realistic WTD-driven peat SOC stock response to climate-change scenarios. Model C-dynamics showed particular sensitivity to water table dynamics through precipitation and runoff, as well as to litter quality and decomposition rates. We show that predicted SOC accumulation and peat ages compare well with observations from a UK peatland site, which is currently (on average) a weak net C source with strong climate sensitivity.

AB The wet to moist bryophyte-dominated vegetation of Sassendalen, Svalbard, was classified into seven communities. These communities were grouped into (1) Cardamino nymanii-Saxifragion foliolosae marsh; (2) Caricion stantis fen; (3) Luzulion nivalis snowbed - including manured vegetation corresponding to moss tundras. All communities have a basically arctic distribution. Marshes are developed in habitats with a water table above the bryophyte vegetation surface and fens on sites with a water table level high above the permafrost but below the bryophyte surface. Moss tundras normally have no standing water table, but in Sassendalen they have a low water table due to their development on less steep slopes than in their normal habitat near bird cliffs.
   CCA confirms that the standing water level is the prime differentiating factor between the alliances, while aspect favourability and permafrost depth differentiate between the fen communities and temporary desiccation is important for the Catoscopium nigritum community. Carex subspathacea is a characteristic fen species in the absence of other Carex species dominating elsewhere in the Arctic. Arctic marshes are linked to an extremely cold environment. They have a very low species diversity with a few species dominating; Arctophila fulva, Pseudocalliergon trifarium, Scorpidium scorpioides and Warnstorfia tundrae are character species. Moss tundra as defined here appears to be restricted to Svalbard and, probably, neighbouring Novaya Zemlya. This may be due to the absence of rodents and the high seabird density, which is related to the mild sea currents reaching further to the north here and which implies manuring of surrounding ecosystems. Manuring in a very cold environment produces moss carpets with a thin active layer and accumulation of thick peat layers without a standing water level. In Sassendalen the role of arctic seabirds is replaced by Svalbard reindeer which are non-migratory and are concentrated to favourable grazing areas where their manuring effect is intense. Their long-term manuring effect probably explains the occurrence of moss tundras in this weakly rolling landscape where seabird colonies are absent.

AB Mowing is widely used in temperate fens to conserve typical flora and fauna by creating or maintaining low, sparse, treeless vegetation with a thin litter layer. In certain cases the removal of the mown biomass may not be feasible because of high costs, or not desirable because of increased disturbance. Few studies have addressed the decomposition of mown biomass, especially with regard to litter fragment size resulting from differences in cutting techniques. We studied biomass decomposition in a near-natural fen in north-eastern Germany, using litter bags with small and large fragments of common reed (Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. Ex. Steud.) in wet and dry locations for ca. 250 days. We observed a significant effect of water level on decomposition, but no effect of the size of litter fragments. The greatest decomposition occurred at the wet plots of the wettest site, the lowest at the dry plots of the driest site. The results demonstrate that water level is an important controlling variable in decomposition and that, in near-natural fens with vegetation dominated by Phragmites, decomposition is greatest in shallowly inundated sites. We conclude that in such sites, cut biomass may be left on site to maintain a thin litter layer but removal of biomass may still be required due to other considerations.

AB The present investigation conducted in Cepkeliai peatland (south-eastern Lithuania) deals with two radioisotope methods - carbon-14 ((14)C) and tritium ((3)H). (14)C was applied to peatland chronology and sedimentation rate estimation and (3)H to peat water dynamics characterization. According to 14C data, peatland development began since 12650-11350 years cal BP and peat accumulation since 10550-9700 years cal BP with peat accumulation rate of 0.27-0.79 mm/year in the central part of the peatland. The peat water mean residence time and basic groundwater flow was estimated to be respectively about 27 +/- 6 years and 62 +/- 15 mm based on (3)H data. The obtained data showed relatively undisturbed natural condition of Cepkeliai peatland in the studied sites.

AB Background: Many minerotrophic fens in Central Europe have undergone similar sequences of land-use transformation. Drained and used as meadows or pastures for decades in the twentieth century, they were abandoned in the 1990s due to changes in agricultural economics. This sequence of land-use change has a severe impact on vegetation and is likely to initiate secondary succession and is possibly leading to an impoverishment in species diversity and to taxonomic homogenisation.
   Aims: We assess the impact of agricultural use and subsequent abandonment on vegetation composition in a percolation fen in north Germany and characterise successional changes and changes in abiotic site conditions.
   Methods: In 2010, we resampled 77 plots of a phytosociological survey from 1967-1970 in a lowland percolation mire complex in the lower Recknitz valley, north-east Germany. These included three characteristic vegetation types of percolation fens. To investigate and quantify vegetation changes we used dissimilarity measures, diversity metrics and ecological species indicator values.
   Results: Overall species richness declined only slightly while there was a more pronounced decrease in species richness at the plot level in all recorded vegetation types, resulting in increased beta diversity. Generalist and nitrophilous species increased in abundance, indicating ongoing succession.
   Conclusions: Drainage for agricultural use and subsequent abandonment has long-lasting effects. Altered hydrological and nutrient status of the fen soil has initiated secondary succession. There is indication of an extinction debt that in the future may lead to an impoverishment of species diversity in the area. Conservation of open mesotrophic fen species may thus only be achieved if moderate use is continued and hydrologic conservation measures are applied on wide contiguous areas.

AB Testate amoebae are a widely-used tool for palaeohydrological reconstruction from peatlands. However, it has been observed that weak idiosomic siliceous tests (WISTs) are common in uppermost peats, but very rarely found as subfossils deeper in the peat profile. This taphonomic problem has been noted widely and it has been established that WISTs disaggregate and/or dissolve in the low pH condition of ombrotrophic peatlands. here we investigate the effect of this taphonomic problem on water-table reconstructions from thirty European peatlands through the comparison of reconstructions based on all taxa and those with WISTs removed. En almost all cases file decomposition of WISTs does not introduce discernible bias to peatland water-table reconstructions. However, some discrepancy is apparent when large abundances of Corythion-Trinema type are present (9-12 cm deviation with 50-60% abundance of this particular taxon). We recommend that WISTs should be removed before carrying out water-table reconstructions, and that the minimum count of testate amoebae per sample should exclude WISTs to ensure the development of robust reconstructions.

AB In this study, the Holocene development of a peat plateau area in the east-European Russian Arctic is reconstructed based on detailed macrofossil, physico-chemical and radiocarbon analyses from two peat sequences. Basal dates from these two, c. 2m long, pear profiles are c. 9420 BP and c. 9250 BP. From another six peat sequences gross-stratigraphic descriptions and additional radiocarbon dates are available. Basal dates from two short (<1 m) pear profiles indicate further peatland expansion at c. 3635 BP and c. 1285 BP. The oldest macrofossils of tree birch are dated to c. 9500 BP and those of conifers, presumably spruce, to c. 8000 BP. Tree stands became rare in the study area after c. 2800 BP, but occasionally occur until present. Peatlands formed through terrestrialization of ponds or paludification of forested uplands. Between 9000 and 3100 BP the peatlands were wet rich fens. Beginning from c. 3100 BP there are marked changes in their surface hydrology, connected with climatic cooling and permafrost aggradation. Sphagnum species started to play a dominant role. Permafrost aggradation at the six pear plateau sites is tentatively dated to c. 3100 BP, c. 2200 BP and <600 BP. Nowadays the area is mostly dry peat plateau with interspersed thermokarst lakes. Generally, peat accumulation rates are lower in the upper layers, which consist mostly of Sphagnum peat, than in the lower layers of sedge/brown moss peat. This is most probably due to ceased accumulation or even erosion in the currently widespread dry lichen stage in the peat plateau.

AB The species composition of vegetation associated with the Carpathian fens primarily depends on the type of water present and the hydrological feeding of the soils that occur there. These, in turn, shape the fertility of the fens. Those with typically formed Carici-Agrostietum caninae and Valeriano-Caricetum flavae fundamentally differ in the properties of their soils and feeding waters. These include differences in mineral content, pH, CaCO3 levels, degree of peat decomposition, electrical conductivity and oxygenation of the waters that feed the fens. Carici-Agrostietum caninae is a homogenous plant association adapted to extreme habitat conditions. It is characterized by a very narrow range of essential soil and feeding water parameters. Valeriano-Caricetum flavae is a highly diverse association. Considerable diversity both in terms of plant species and vegetation structure reflects very wide ranges in the properties of soil and feeding water. Vegetation patches of transitory character were also identified. These contained plant species characteristic of both associations. The character of the vegetation depends mainly on fen soil pH and the degree of mineralization of the feeding waters. It is only these parameters that allow intermediate patches to be clearly distinguished. The degree of peat decomposition, mineral content and water oxygenation all differ for Carici-Agrostietum caninae and Valeriano-Caricetum flavae, whereas the values for intermediate patches display a range of parameters typical of both investigated associations. Consequently, vegetation present in these patches reflects to a greater or lesser extent one of the two analyzed plant associations.

AB A late Miocene paludal to lacustrine sequence from a carbonate basin in NW Bulgaria (Staniantsi Basin) is analysed displaying up to 27 rhythmically bedded sedimentary cycles. In the lower part of the sequence, the cycles consist of alternating autochthonous brown coal and marls containing diverse mollusc assemblages. The upper part of the sequence is characterized by alternating dark to light grey clays and calcareous silts. A palynomorph record comprising 163 samples is analysed by statistical means to reconstruct vegetation changes. The Coexistence Approach is used to calculate quantitative palaeoclimate records for 6 parameters. The studied section displays hierarchical cyclicity patterns. Longer-term cycles possibly related to eccentricity (period similar to 100 kyr) are present in the palynomorph record and show climate changes of warmer/wetter and cooler/drier periods in combination with frequency oscillations of thermophilous elements. Short-term cycles most probably related to precession (period similar to 21.7 kyr) are expressed by alternations of brown coal and marl/shell beds and show cyclic change in peat-forming vegetation related to oscillations of the groundwater level. As a triggering mechanism, wetter/warmer and drier/cooler climate phases related to orbital precession are probable. In addition, sections sampled at high resolution display small scale climate and vegetational variability.
   As is shown by the analysis ferns were an important component of the peat-forming vegetation, while outside the mire, a wetland vegetation consisting of pioneers and a mixed mesophytic forest with evergreen shrubs existed. An oligo- to mesotrophic slightly alkaline lake became repeatedly established with a diverse mollusc fauna and a dense hydrophytic vegetation with characean meadows. In the upper part of the section, a spreading of herbaceous vegetation is observed, also known from other contemporaneaous palynomorph records in Bulgaria and surrounding areas. The increase of Asteraceae in the upper part of the section, combined with a marked decrease in woody taxa, points to an opening of habitats and a decrease in mean annual precipitation. This trend is paralleled by the mollusc fauna which yields several terrestrial, partly xerophilous taxa. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The regional/national carbon (C) stock of peatlands is often poorly characterised, even for comparatively well-studied areas. A key obstacle to better estimates of landscape C stock is the scarcity of data on peat depth, leading to simplistic assumptions. New measurements of peat depth become unrealistically resource-intensive when considering large areas. Therefore, it is imperative to maximise the use of pre-existing datasets. Here we propose that one potentially valuable and currently unexploited source of peat depth data is palaeoecological studies. We discuss the value of these data and present an initial compilation for Scotland (United Kingdom) which consists of records from 437 sites and yields an average depth of 282 cm per site. This figure is likely to be an over-estimate of true average peat depth and is greater than figures used in current estimates of peatland C stock. Depth data from palaeoecological studies have the advantages of wide distribution, high quality, and often the inclusion of valuable supporting information; but also the disadvantage of spatial bias due to the differing motivations of the original researchers. When combined with other data sources, each with its own advantages and limitations, we believe that palaeoecological datasets can make an important contribution to better-constrained estimates of peat depth which, in turn, will lead to better estimates of peatland landscape carbon stock.

AB Effective conservation management is dependent on accessing and integrating different forms of evidence regarding the potential impacts of management interventions. Here, we explore the application of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN), which are graphical models that incorporate probabilistic relationships among variables of interest, to evidence-based conservation management. We consider four case studies, namely: (i) impacts of deer grazing on saltmarsh vegetation; (ii) impacts of burning on upland bog vegetation; (iii) control of the invasive exotic plant Rhododendron ponticum; and (iv) management of lowland heathland by burning. Each of these themes is currently a significant conservation issue in the UK, and yet the potential outcomes of management interventions are poorly understood. Through these examples, we demonstrate that BBNs can be used to integrate and explore evidence from a variety of sources, including expert opinion and quantitative results from research investigations. Incorporation of such information in BBNs enables different sources of evidence to be compared, the potential impacts of management interventions to be explored and management trade-offs to be identified. BBNs also offer a highly visual tool for communicating the uncertainty associated with potential management outcomes to conservation practitioners, and they can also be readily updated as new evidence becomes available. Based on these features, we suggest that BBNs have outstanding potential for supporting evidence-based approaches to conservation management. (C) 2007 Elsevier GrnbH. All rights reserved.

AB Methanogens (domain Archaea) have a unique role in the carbon cycle as producers of the greenhouse gas methane (CH(4)). Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is a vital enzyme in CH(4) production, and the mcrA gene coding for a subunit of MCR has been employed as a specific marker for the detection and differentiation of methanogen communities. A critical step in assessing environmental mcrA diversity is the selection of PCR primers. The objective of this study was to compare the diversity coverage of three published mcrA primer sets MCR, ME and ML (also known as MCR and Luton-mcrA) and their ability to discern methanogen communities in a drained peatland. The primers were applied to DNA extracts from unfertilised and ash-fertilised peat from two different depths. Amplified mcrA communities were cloned and sequenced, and the sequences were divided into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequence analysis. All primers recovered characteristic OTUs associated with the peat depths and treatments and confirmed a previous observation of low methanogen diversity. The minor differences in OTU ranges of the primers did not greatly affect the observed community composition. However, as the proportions of several OTUs varied strongly, the primers provided different quantitative representations of mcrA communities. We concluded that the ML and MCR primers had better amplification ranges than the ME set, but the use of MCR with peat samples was problematic due to poor amplification. Consequently, the ML primers were best suited for mcrA analysis of peatland methanogen communities. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI CONIFER PLANTATIONS ON DRAINED PEATLANDS IN BRITAIN - A NET GAIN OR LOSS
   OF CARBON
SO FORESTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID PRODUCTS; TREES; SOILS
AB It is estimated that British peatlands, excluding lowland fens, contain about 3000 million tonnes of carbon, 76 per cent of which is in deep peats (> 45 cm deep) and 9 per cent of which has been drained and planted with trees.
   Undisturbed peatlands emit CH4 but accumulate CO2-derived carbon. The net greenhouse effect may be near zero. Peatland drainage virtually stops methane emission and increases CO2-carbon loss through aerobic decomposition, but can also increase CO2-carbon fixation by the peatland vegetation partly through microbial mineralization of nitrogen, resulting in either a net loss or gain in CO2-carbon.
   Planting conifer forests leads to an accumulation of CO2-derived carbon in the trees, wood products, litter and forest soil up to equilibrium values, totalling about 16.7 kg C m-2 for Picea sitchensis, Yield Class 12. Deep and shallow peats in the British uplands contain about 0.47 and 0.80 kg cm-2 per centimetre depth, respectively. Thus, the 16.7 kg C m-2 that is stored by P. sitchensis (Yield Class 12) is equivalent to the carbon stored in about 35.5 cm of deep peat or 20.9 cm of shallow peat. If forests are planted on peats substantially deeper than this, there could be a net loss of CO2-carbon in the long term.
   Scenarios are presented for the time course of CO2-carbon gain and loss when peatlands are drained and planted with conifers. If CO2 loss rates from drained peats are 50-100 g C m-2 a-1 there is likely to be increased carbon storage in the whole system for at least three rotations; but if CO2 loss rates are 200-300 g C m-2 a-1, increased storage may be restricted to the first rotation, after which there is a net loss of carbon.

AB Peat molecular chemistry reflects a combination of plant input and decomposition. Both vegetation community and the degree of decomposition of plant remains are highly dependent on depth and fluctuation of the water table and thus peat organic matter (OM) chemistry reflects past hydrological conditions. Changes in hydrology according to the OM composition (by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, pyrolysis-GC/MS) in a high-resolution sampled monolith of an 8000 years old peat deposit are presented. Analysis of 18 modern vegetation species resulted in molecular markers for Erica spp., Deschampsia flexuosa, Juncus bulbosus and Carex binervis, in addition to more general markers which enabled differentiation between woody, grass and moss vegetation. Factor analysis of 106 pyrolysis products quantified for all peat samples enabled identification of mineral (Factor 1) and hydrological (Factor 2) conditions of the bog. Depth profiles of vegetation markers showed good agreement with those of the scores of both factors and enabled the identification of 14 relatively wet periods, dating to 1430-1865 AD, 930-1045 AD, 640 AD, 270-385 AD, 190-215 AD, 135 AD, 45 BC-15 AD, 260-140 BC, 640-440 BC, 1055-960 BC, 1505-1260 BC, 2300 BC, 41902945 BC and 5700-5205 BC, which show excellent agreement with other palaeoclimatic studies in Europe. The results emphasize the importance of high-resolution sampling, in combination with the use of multiple vegetation markers and other peat OM characteristics for a proper interpretation of a peat record.

AB The retention of peatland carbon (C) and the ability to continue to draw down and store C from the atmosphere is not only important for the UK terrestrial carbon inventory, but also for a range of ecosystem services, the landscape value and the ecology and hydrology of similar to 15% of the land area of the UK. Here we review the current state of knowledge on the C balance of UK peatlands using several studies which highlight not only the importance of making good flux measurements, but also the spatial and temporal variability of different flux terms that characterise a landscape affected by a range of natural and anthropogenic processes and threats. Our data emphasise the importance of measuring (or accurately estimating) all components of the peatland C budget. We highlight the role of the aquatic pathway and suggest that fluxes are higher than previously thought. We also compare the contemporary C balance of several UK peatlands with historical rates of C accumulation measured using peat cores, thus providing a long-term context for present-day measurements and their natural year-on-year variability. Contemporary measurements from 2 sites suggest that current accumulation rates (-56 to -72 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) are at the lower end of those seen over the last 150 yr in peat cores (-35 to -209 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Finally, we highlight significant current gaps in knowledge and identify where levels of uncertainty are high, as well as emphasise the research challenges that need to be addressed if we are to improve the measurement and prediction of change in the peatland C balance over future decades.

AB Drainage-induced shifts in physicochemical peat properties are irreversible on a decadal time span. We investigated whether carbon emissions from fen peat can be estimated using two proxies: current water levels and peat properties (as affected by drainage history, i.e. degradation legacy). We collected bare peat monoliths from a long-term drained and an undrained fen. In a crossed design, half of the monoliths was kept wet and the other half was drained. Highest carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions came from the originally undrained peat under low water levels (607 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Overall, CO2 emissions were primarily determined by drainage history, with 141 % higher emissions from the originally undrained peat. In addition, low current water levels correlated with 42 % higher emissions. Highest methane (CH4) emissions were measured in the originally undrained peat under high water levels (123 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Overall, CH4 emissions were primarily determined by current water levels, with 430 % higher emissions under high water levels. In addition, the originally undrained peat had 180 % higher emissions. The lower C efflux from originally drained peat correlated with lower concentrations of methanogens and of easily-degradable carbon substrate (cellulose). We conclude that substrate limitation in long-term drained fens ensures low baseline carbon emissions, which provides opportunities for renewed carbon sequestration by rewetting.

AB The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed the restoration of wetlands impacted by a series of drainage ditches and pools located in an extensive undeveloped peatland in the Seney National Wildlife Refuge, Michigan. This study examined the nature and extent of degradation to the Marsh Creek wetlands caused by alteration of natural hydrology by a water-storage pool (C-3 Pool) that intersects the Marsh Creek channel. We tested the hypothesis that a reduction in moderate-intensity disturbance associated with natural water-level fluctuations below the C-3 dike contributed to lower species richness, reduced floristic quality and a larger tree and shrub component than vegetation upstream from the pool. Wetland plant communities were sampled quantitatively and analyzed for species richness, floristic quality and physiognomy. Aerial photographs, GIS databases and GPS data contributed to the characterization and analysis of the Marsh Creek wetlands. Results showed that there was lower species richness in vegetated areas downstream from the pool, but not the anticipated growth in shrubs. Wetland vegetation upstream and downstream from the pool had similar floristic quality, except for a greater number of weedy taxa above the pool. Seepage through the pool dike and localized ground-water discharge created conditions very similar to those observed around beaver dams in Marsh Creek. In essence, the dike containing the C-3 Pool affected hydrology and wetland plant communities in a manner similar to an enormous beaver dam, except that it did not allow seasonal flooding episodes to occur. Management actions to release water from the pool into the original Marsh Creek channel at certain times and in certain amounts that mimic the natural flow regime would be expected to promote greater plant species richness and minimize the negative impacts of the dike.

AB A high-resolution, 5300-yr record of pollen and lithogenic elements (K, Ca, Ti, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr) from an ombrotrophic peat bog located in northwest Spain, reveals that the variations in the fluxes of lithogenic elements supplied to the bog by atmospheric deposition were coupled to the evolution of the vegetation of the area. A strong negative correlation exists between the percentage of tree pollen and the concentration of lithogenic elements. For example, the correlation between total tree pollen and Sr concentrations is - 0.94. The main phases of decline of the deciduous forest occurred during known cultural periods (late Neolithic, the Metal Ages, the Roman Period, the Middle Ages and the Industrial period) suggesting a close link between human activities (fires and forest clearances), changes in the vegetation and soil erosion. The flux of lithogenic elements seems to have increased before a significant variation in pollen is detected, which may indicate that changes in soil erosion are reflected earlier than the changes in vegetation in the bog record. Variations in the composition of the deposited dust reflect impacts that occurred at different spatial scales, with local sources dominant in the late Neolithic, the Metal Ages and the Middle Ages, whilst regional sources are more important in the Roman period and the Industrial Revolution. During the prehistoric period, arboreal pollen percentages recovered to their former levels, suggesting that woodland regenerated following a disturbance phase, but for the last 1400 years no significant recovery took place until afforestation with Pines was introduced 200 years ago. While this must be the result of continuous clearances to convert forest into arable land, a cumulative effect on soil degradation must also be implied.

AB Globally, peatlands represent important stores of carbon which may have an important influence on future climatic conditions. Understanding how peatlands will influence, and also respond to, future climates will require an understanding of their thermal behavior. Peatland surfaces are often characterized by a 3-D microtopography. Therefore, we might expect strong horizontal thermal gradients and exchanges between neighboring microforms with contrasting hydrological regimes and vegetation composition. However, previous peatland temperature models have assumed that horizontal temperature gradients are insignificant and that temperatures can be simulated adequately by applying 1-D vertical models. We outline the development, parameterization, and evaluation of a 3-D model that simulates peat temperatures in two microforms, a Sphagnum fuscum hummock surrounded by a Sphagnum magellanicum lawn, to identify the importance of such horizontal heat fluxes. The 3-D Heat-in-Peat (HIP) model provides a reasonable representation of temperatures in the microforms with a root-mean-squared error between modeled and measured peat temperatures ranging from 2.33 degrees to 0.20 degrees C. The 3-D HIP model highlights the importance of a 3-D microtopography on the surface energy balance and peat temperatures. Comparison of the 3-D HIP model with 1-D simulations of peat temperatures shows that horizontal temperature gradients significantly influence peat temperatures within the hummock, with simulated temperatures at a depth of 0.375 m beneath the hummock being underestimated by up to 1.2 degrees C in 1-D simulations. In contrast, temperatures within the Sphagnum magellanicum lawn were adequately simulated by ignoring horizontal heat fluxes.

AB The present study makes use of a detailed water balance to investigate the hydrological status of a peatland with a basal clay-rich layer overlying an aquifer exploited for drinking water. The aim is to determine the influence of climate and groundwater extraction on the water balance and water levels in the peatland. During the two-year period of monitoring, the hydrological functioning of the wetland showed a hydric deficit, associated with a permanent unsaturated layer and a deep water table. At the same time, a stream was observed serving as a recharge inflow instead of draining the peatland, as usually described in natural systems. Such conditions are not favourable for peat accumulation. Field investigations show that the clay layer has a high hydraulic conductivity (from 1.10(-7) to 3.10(-9) m.s(-1)) and does not form a hydraulic barrier. Moreover, the vertical hydraulic gradients are downward between the peat and the sand aquifer, leading to high flows of groundwater through the clay layer (20-48% of the precipitation). The observed hydric deficit of the peatland results from a combination of dry climatic conditions during the study period and groundwater extraction. The climatic effect is mainly expressed through drying out of the peatland, while the anthropogenic effect leads to an enhancement of the climatic effect on a global scale, and a modification of fluxes at a local scale. The drying out of the peatland can lead to its mineralisation, which thus gives rise to environmental impacts. The protection of such wetlands in the context of climate change should take account of anthropogenic pressures by considering the wetland-aquifer interaction.

AB A high-resolution peat humification record is obtained from Hani peatland, northeastern China to study climate change. An absorbance value time series from alkali-extraction is used as a peat humification indicator. In addition, Hani peat magnetic susceptibility and trace elements have also been investigated. There is a sensitive response to abrupt climate changes when comparing a high-resolution peat humification record with a Hani delta O-18 temperature proxy record and a drift ice record from the North Atlantic Ocean. Based on analyses of factors that affect peat decomposition, we suggest similar paleoclimate significance between the Hani and Dajiuhu peat on the degree of humification with a higher peat humification indicating colder and drier climate conditions. In contrast, a warm and moist climate provides a deoxidized condition that results in lower peat humification. Moreover, the Rb/Sr ratios and chi(lf) in Hani peatland also indicate different climate conditions, especially in late Holocene. According to the Hani peat data, regional paleoclimate variations can be divided into the following five phases: 11.5-10.0 cal. kyr BP with warm climate conditions; 10.0-8.8 cal. kyr BP with sharply cooling and warming climate conditions; 8.8-4.8 cal. kyr BP with alternating cooling and warming climate conditions; 4.8-1.6 cal. kyr BP with warm climate conditions overall and 1.6-0 cal. kyr BP with cold climate conditions.

AB The knowledge about the evolution of the mountain areas is a very interesting issue from the palaeoenvironmental stand point, but also from the archaeological view in relation with human occupations. In this paper we analyze the composition and evolution of the vegetation of the peat bog of Sotombo, located in the vicinity of the Collados del Ason Natural Park (Cantabria) over the last 6000 years, through the study of pollens, spores and non-pollen palynomorphs, with the support of 8 AMS radiocarbon dates. The main results point the dominance of deciduous forests with pines between ca. 5926-2418 cal BP. From this moment is clearly evident the anthropogenic activities, in contemporary to the expansion of the beech forests. Subsequently (from ca. 596 cal BP) starts the development of mountain meadows, that dominate the current landscape.

AB Questions: 1. To what extent does light availability differ among fen plant communities? 2. To what extent does light coincide with productivity and moisture gradients? 3. Does light act as an important environmental filter in natural and transformed riparian landscapes?
   Location: Current data from the Biebrza Valley, NE Poland; literature data from the Trebon area, Czech Republic and four sites in the western and southern Netherlands.
   Methods: Relative light intensity (RLI) was measured in vertical profiles, next to vegetation releves accompanied by measurements of above-ground biomass, summer groundwater level, N and P content in vegetation, pH and soil redox potential. Data derived from literature included profiles of RLI, biomass and vegetation records. Relationships between RLI and biomass and between species distribution, RLI and other variables were examined by regression analysis and CCA. Four traits were analysed: ability to spread clonally, seed weight, maximum height of adults and time of commencement of flowering.
   Results: RLI at ground level varied from <1% in reed beds and tall herb meadows to >60% in sedge-moss communities and litter meadows. RLI was largely determined by the standing crop and explained a large part of variation in species occurrence. The combinations of analysed functional traits were constrained by the communities' light profiles.
   Conclusion: Light availability is related more closely to site fertility than to hydrological regime. This confirms that hydrological regime and productivity should be analysed separately with regard to their effect on species distribution in wetlands. Limited light availability seems the major environmental control of the distribution of low growing and late flowering species.

AB The concentrations of mineral element in three species of Sphagnum (S. fallax, S. magellanicum and S. capillifolium) as well as in bog-pool water were determined at periodic intervals during the 1989 growing season. Potassium, calcium and heavy metals account for most of the interspecific variation, K being more concentrated in hollow species, Ca as well as heavy metals in hummock species. The concentrations of other elements show a seasonal pattern of variation largely common to all species and therefore reflecting general processes. Sodium, magnesium, and to a certain degree calcium become progressively more concentrated in Sphagnum tissues during the growing season and are leached from cell walls prevalently during the cold months. Nitrogen and to a lesser extent phosphorus are enriched in the chlorophyl lose cells during the period of intense growth and are leaked from the cell interior as soon as growth rate becomes slower. Leaching of nutrients is probably determined by an increased permeability of plasmalemma determined by senescence.

AB . In a small alluvial floodplain depression (21 ha) of the river Dijle, a selection of 56 characteristic, mainly groundwater-depending plant species was mapped using a regular 20 by 20 m square cell mapping grid. In order to understand the spatial distribution of the plant species and their vegetation types, several environmental variables, including groundwater regime, groundwater chemistry, soil texture, soil chemical composition and management type were measured in detail. Using Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Detrended Correspondence Analysis, the relation between these environmental variables and the plant species and vegetation types, respectively, is described in detail. Management type and groundwater fluctuations are recognized as the two main sets of environmental variables causing the specific spatial distribution of plant species and vegetation types for the mire-ecosystem of the silty alluvial floodplain.

AB Permafrost soils store over half of global soil carbon (C), and northern frozen peatlands store about 10% of global permafrost C. With thaw, inundation of high latitude lowland peatlands typically increases the surface-atmosphere flux of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas. To examine the effects of lowland permafrost thaw over millennial timescales, we measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 exchange along sites that constitute a similar to 1000 yr thaw chronosequence of thermokarst collapse bogs and adjacent fen locations at Innoko Flats Wildlife Refuge in western Alaska. Peak CH4 exchange in July (123 +/- 71 mg CH4-Cm-2 d(-1)) was observed in features that have been thawed for 30 to 70 (<100) yr, where soils were warmer than at more recently thawed sites (14 to 21 yr; emitting 1.37 +/- 0.67 mg CH4-Cm-2 d(-1) in July) and had shallower water tables than at older sites (200 to 1400 yr; emitting 6.55 +/- 2.23 mg CH4-Cm- 2 d-1 in July). Carbon lost via CH4 efflux during the growing season at these intermediate age sites was 8% of uptake by net ecosystem exchange. Our results provide evidence that CH4 emissions following lowland permafrost thaw are enhanced over decadal time scales, but limited over millennia. Over larger spatial scales, adjacent fen systems may contribute sustained CH4 emission, CO2 uptake, and DOC export. We argue that over timescales of decades to centuries, thaw features in high-latitude lowland peatlands, particularly those developed on poorly drained mineral substrates, are a key locus of elevated CH4 emission to the atmosphere that must be considered for a complete understanding of high latitude CH4 dynamics.

AB In boreal peatlands, low decomposition rate is the underlying cause of carbon sequestration. Decomposition of litter can be affected by factors relating to soil moisture and temperature, the quality of the litter, and by the biotic decomposer community, among others. Exploring how these drivers interact will provide better understanding of carbon dynamics in boreal peatlands. We measured the decomposition of three common peatland plant functional types (moss, sedge, shrub), and associated microarthropod communities using litterbags placed in hollows (wet depressions) and hummocks (dry, raised areas) of a boreal peatland in Ontario, Canada. Decomposition was significantly different between all plant litter types, and greatest in sedge, but was not significantly different between hummock and hollow microhabitats. The decomposer community displayed an opposite pattern, significantly affected by microhabitat where richness and abundance of microarthropods was greater in hollows than hummocks. Oribatid mites were the dominant microarthropod with respect to both richness and abundance. Plant litter type did not affect community structure in hollows, but was a determinant of oribatid dominance in hummocks. These results suggest that abiotic environmental conditions are the main drivers of community structure for decomposers, while plant litter quality is a more important determinant of decomposition dynamics in boreal peatlands.

AB Complex of Nature reservation Zbytka is the rest of various fen vegetation in the northeast part of the Czech Republic. It represents an important spring area which provides high quality potable water for more than 150 000 inhabitants. Waterworks utilization was started in the 1960s and the change of land-use practices has had a strong effect on the ecosystem. Oak chronology has been showing different tree growth trends since the start of the waterworks utilization. Also the occurrences of negative pointer years differ markedly before and after initiation of pumping underground water. Dendroclimatological analyses primarily revealed a close relationship between the temperature and tree growth - positive influence of spring and summer temperature. The period 1983-1992 of maximum artesian water pumping is expressed as higher tree-ring increments, but linear model analyses showed that the growth reaction of oak is not due to simple causality between temperature and under-ground water level. The radial increments reacted positively to the combination of high temperature during the vegetation season and low or, the contrary, high depth of underground water level. No direct relationship was detected between tree growth and fluctuation of underground water level; despite of the results dendrochronological data may be useful in historical ground water modelling studies. Results are also crucial for conflict of interests between nature preservation and potable water supply.

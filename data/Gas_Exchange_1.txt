AB Northern peatlands in general have high methane (CH4) emissions, but individual peatlands show considerable variation as CH4 sources. Particularly in nutrient-poor peatlands, CH4 production can be low and exceeded by carbon dioxide (CO2) production from unresolved anaerobic processes. To clarify the role anaerobic bacterial degraders play in this variation, we compared consumers of cellobiose-derived carbon in two fens differing in nutrient status and the ratio of CO2 to CH4 produced. After [C-13] cellobiose amendment, the mesotrophic fen produced equal amounts of CH4 and CO2. The oligotrophic fen had lower CH4 production but produced 3 to 59 times more CO2 than CH4. RNA stable-isotope probing revealed that in the mesotrophic fen with higher CH4 production, cellobiose-derived carbon was mainly assimilated by various recognized fermenters of Firmicutes and by Proteobacteria. The oligotrophic peat with excess CO2 production revealed a wider variety of cellobiose-C consumers, including Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, but also more unconventional degraders, such as Telmatobacter-related Acidobacteria and subphylum 3 of Verrucomicrobia. Prominent and potentially fermentative Planctomycetes and Chloroflexi did not appear to process cellobiose-C. Our results show that anaerobic degradation resulting in different levels of CH4 production can involve distinct sets of bacterial degraders. By distinguishing cellobiose degraders from the total community, this study contributes to defining anaerobic bacteria that process cellulose-derived carbon in peat. Several of the identified degraders, particularly fermenters and potential Fe(III) or humic substance reducers in the oligotrophic peat, represent promising candidates for resolving the origin of excess CO2 production in peatlands.
   IMPORTANCE Peatlands are major sources of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4), yet in many peatlands, CO2 production from unresolved anaerobic processes exceeds CH4 production. Anaerobic degradation produces the precursors of CH4 production but also represents competing processes. We show that anaerobic degradation leading to high or low CH4 production involved distinct sets of bacteria. Well-known fermenters dominated in a peatland with high CH4 production, while novel and unconventional degraders could be identified in a site where CO2 production greatly exceeds CH4 production. Our results help identify and assign functions to uncharacterized bacteria that promote or inhibit CH4 production and reveal bacteria potentially producing the excess CO2 in acidic peat. This study contributes to understanding the microbiological basis for different levels of CH4 emission from peatlands.

TI Prompt rewetting of drained peatlands reduces climate warming despite
   methane emissions
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID SINK
AB Peatlands are strategic areas for climate change mitigation because of their matchless carbon stocks. Drained peatlands release this carbon to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2). Peatland rewetting effectively stops these CO2 emissions, but also re-establishes the emission of methane (CH4). Essentially, management must choose between CO2 emissions from drained, or CH4 emissions from rewetted, peatland. This choice must consider radiative effects and atmospheric lifetimes of both gases, with CO2 being a weak but persistent, and CH4 a strong but short-lived, greenhouse gas. The resulting climatic effects are, thus, strongly time-dependent. We used a radiative forcing model to compare forcing dynamics of global scenarios for future peatland management using areal data from the Global Peatland Database. Our results show that CH4 radiative forcing does not undermine the climate change mitigation potential of peatland rewetting. Instead, postponing rewetting increases the long-term warming effect through continued CO2 emissions. Drained peatlands are sources of CO2, and though rewetting could curb emissions, this strategy results in elevated methane release. Here, the authors model peatland emissions scenarios and show that rewetting is a critical way to mitigate climate change despite potential methane increases.

AB Peatlands have accumulated vast quantities of organic carbon over thousands of years but it is unclear how these sensitive ecosystems will respond to future climate change. If emissions of methane from peatlands increase, then they may contribute increasingly towards climatic warming due to the higher greenhouse warming potential of this gas. We investigated the radiocarbon concentration of methane emissions from a temperate bog over 1.5 years, which we supported with measurements of the surface flux of methane and carbon dioxide. The radiocarbon content of methane emissions varied greatly, from modern (i.e. fixed from the atmosphere within recent decades) to similar to 1400 years BP. Flux rates of methane were spatially and temporally highly variable. A vegetation clipping experiment showed that plants had a great influence on the carbon isotope composition and flux of methane emitted from the peat surface, consistent with earlier studies showing the key role of plants in peatland methane emissions. When plants were absent, emission rates were 70-94% lower and the radiocarbon age of methane emissions was much younger and less variable. Our radiocarbon measurements show that at this peatland, plant-associated methane emissions contain carbon originally fixed from the atmosphere up to hundreds of years earlier, consistent with a contribution from plant mediated transport of methane sourced from sub-surface layers.

AB Peat excavation has altered carbon balance in large areas in the Northern Hemisphere and turned peatlands from CO2 sinks to CO2 sources. Peatland restoration aims at mitigating that situation by supporting CO2 uptake in these areas through raising the water table, in this way creating conditions for vegetation development and organic matter accumulation. We analysed the relationships between recovering vegetation and CO2 fluxes on three abandoned peat excavation sites in northern Estonia, which were rewetted and restored using the moss-layer-transfer technique three to ten years before the first measurements. Using chamber measurements, we determined whether these sites were CO2 sinks or sources during two growing seasons in 2015 (drier) and 2016 (wetter). In the drier growing season, all sites were CO2 sources from the peatland to the atmosphere (emissions from 1 to 77 g CO2 m(-2)), while in the wetter growing season, two sites were CO2 sinks (uptake from 13 to 210 g CO2 m(-2)). CO2 uptake was higher with higher plant and Eriophorum vaginatum cover, and biomass and cover of Sphagnum. The remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) explained about 25% of variation in Net Ecosystem Exchange; CO2 uptake was higher in plots with higher NDVI values. This provides a potential avenue of investigation of developing remote sensing methods in assessing spatial pattern of CO2 fluxes in restored peatlands. In order to increase CO2 uptake in abandoned milled peatlands, it is essential to raise the water level and thus reduce peat oxidation and create conditions for the development of vegetation similar to pristine peatlands.

AB Boreal peatlands contain a large portion of the Earth's terrestrial organic carbon and may be particularly vulnerable to changes in climate. Temperatures in boreal regions are predicted to increase during the twenty-first century which may accelerate changes in soil microbial processes and plant community dynamics. In particular, climate-driven changes in plant community composition might affect the pathways and rates of methanogenesis, the plant-mediated emission of methane, and the scavenging of methane by methanotrophic bacteria. Climate change may also affect methane cycling through changes in pore water chemistry. To date, these feedbacks have not been incorporated into the carbon cycling components of climate models. We investigated the effects of soil warming and water table manipulations on methane cycling in a field mesocosm experiment in northern Minnesota, USA. Large intact soil monoliths removed from a bog and fen received infrared warming treatments crossed with water table treatments for 6 years. In years 5 and 6, concentrations, fluxes, and isotopic compositions of methane were measured along with aboveground and belowground net primary productivity and pore water concentrations of acetate, sulfate, ammonium, nitrate, and dissolved organic carbon. Water table level was the dominant control over methane flux in the fen mesocosms, likely through its effect on methane oxidation rates. However, pore water chemistry and plant productivity were important secondary factors in explaining methane flux in the fen mesocosms, and these factors appeared to be the predominant controls over methane flux in the bog mesocosms. The water table and IR treatments had large effects on pore water chemistry and plant productivity, so the indirect effects of climate change appear to be just as important as the direct effects of changing temperature and water table level in controlling future methane fluxes from northern peatlands. Pore water sulfate, ammonium, nitrate, and acetate had a relatively consistent negative relationship with methane emissions, pore water DOC had a positive relationship with methane emissions, and BNPP had mixed effects. The bog mesocosms had much higher methane emissions and pore water methane concentrations than the fen mesocosms, despite a much lower average water table level and peat that is a poor substrate for methanogenesis. We suggest that the relatively high methane fluxes in the bog mesocosms can be explained through their low concentrations of inhibitory pore water compounds, high concentrations of DOC, and high plant productivity. Stable isotopic data from pore water support acetate fermentation as the principal pathway of methanogenesis in bog mesocosms (mean delta(13) CH4 = -41.0%, mean delta D-CH4 = -190%). Fen mesocosms had lower pore water concentrations and emissions of methane than bog mesocosms, despite much higher methane production potentials in fen peat. The methane from the fen mesocosms was isotopically heavy (mean delta(CH4)-C-13 = -28.9%, mean delta D-CH4 = -140%), suggesting a strong oxidative sink. This is likely related to the dominance of graminoid vegetation and the associated oxygen transport into the rhizosphere. Our results illustrate the need for a more robust understanding of the multiple feedbacks between climate forcing and plant and microbial feedbacks in the response of northern peatlands to climate change.

Diurnal variations in methane emission in the fens and hollows of the ridge-hollow complex (RHC) are revealed as well as their reproducibility in 2013-2014. The maximum emission is registered in the daytime, and the minimum is observed at night. There is no diurnal variation in methane emission in ryams (pine bogs) and ridges of RHC. It is revealed that in the upper layer of peat (at the depth up to 10 cm for hollows and at the depth of 2 and 5 cm for fens) the contribution of temperature variability to methane emission variations in fens and hollows is 15-20%. The multiple linear regression with peat temperature at several depths allows explaining 44-54% of the variability of methane flux from peatlands. No significant correlation between methane fluxes and the temperature of peat and air was identified in the diurnal cycle in ryams and ridges.

AB Methane flux from northern peatlands is believed to be an important contribution to the global methane budget. High latitude regions are predicted to experience significant changes in surface temperature and precipitation associated with the 2 x CO2 climate scenarios, but the effects of these changes on methane emission are poorly understood. A peatland hydrologic model predicted June-August decreases in water storage of between 82 and 144 mm, using as inputs increases in temperatures of 3-degrees-C and rainfall of 1 mm d-1. These changes translate into a water table drop, relative to the peat surface, of between 14 and 22 cm, depending on whether the fen has a floating or non-floating surface. The 3-degrees-C air temperature increase was predicted to raise peat temperature at 10 cm depth by 0.8-degrees-C. These changes were then applied to relationships derived at a subarctic fen for water table: methane flux: temperature at 10 cm depth. Increased temperatures raise the methane flux by between 5 and 40%, but the lowered water table decreases methane flux by 74 and 81%, at the floating and non-floating fen sites, respectively. These results suggest that methane emissions from northern peatlands are more sensitive to changes in moisture regime than temperature within the range of changes predicted for 2 x CO2 scenarios.

AB We developed and tested a new method to collect CO2 from the surface to deep layers of a peatland for radiocarbon analysis. The method comprises two components: i) a probe equipped with a hydrophobic filter that allows entry of peat gases by diffusion, whilst simultaneously excluding water and ii) a cartridge containing zeolite molecular sieve that traps CO2 passively. We field tested the method by sampling at depths of between 0.25 and 4 m at duplicate sites within a temperate raised peat bog. CO2 was trapped at a depth-dependent rate of between similar to 0.2 and 0.8 ml d(-1), enabling sufficient CO2 for routine C-14 analysis to be collected when left in place for several weeks. The age of peatland CO2 increased with depth from modern to similar to 170 BP for samples collected from 0.25 m, to 4000 BP at 4 m. The CO2 was younger, but followed a similar trend to the age profile of bulk peat previously reported for the site (Langdon and Barber, 2005). delta C-13 values of recovered CO2 increased with depth. CO2 collected from the deepest sampling probes was considerably C-13-enriched (up to similar to+97 parts per thousand) and agreed well with results reported for other peatlands where this phenomenon has been attributed to fermentation processes. CO2 collected from plant-free static chambers at the surface of the mire was slightly C-14-enriched compared to the contemporary atmosphere, suggesting that surface CO2 emissions were predominantly derived from carbon fixed during the post-bomb era. However, consistent trends of enriched C-13 and depleted C-14 in chamber CO2 between autumn and winter samples were most likely explained by an increased contribution of deep peat CO2 to the surface efflux in winter. The passive sampling technique is readily portable, easy to install and operate, causes minimal site disturbance, and can be reliably used to collect peatland CO2 from a wide range of depths.

AB Methane fluxes were studied at two high-elevation oligotrophic peat bogs in the Ore Mts., Czech Republic. The Bukova dolina Bog was drained 15 years ago and 2 years ago was partly restored, whereas the Brumiste Bog is an intact peatland. Draining led to a change of vegetation structure, dominated by Molinia caerulea, Carex sp., and forestation by Norway spruce. Methane fluxes were measured monthly from April to November 2011 using a closed chamber. Temperature and presence of Carex were significant controls on methane fluxes. Peat depth, water table and the presence of other plant species had no significant effect on CH4 emissions. Methane emissions ranged from 9 to 2700 mg/m(2)/day at the degraded and from 3 to 260 mg/m(2)/day at the intact bog. In general, the degraded peat bog emitted three times more methane compared to the intact peat bog, likely due to vegetation changes after long-term artificial draining.

TI Temperature-Induced Increase in Methane Release from Peat Bogs: A
   Mesocosm Experiment
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CARBON; PEATLANDS; CH4
AB Peat bogs are primarily situated at mid to high latitudes and future climatic change projections indicate that these areas may become increasingly wetter and warmer. Methane emissions from peat bogs are reduced by symbiotic methane oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs). Higher temperatures and increasing water levels will enhance methane production, but also methane oxidation. To unravel the temperature effect on methane and carbon cycling, a set of mesocosm experiments were executed, where intact peat cores containing actively growing Sphagnum were incubated at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 degrees C. After two months of incubation, methane flux measurements indicated that, at increasing temperatures, methanotrophs are not able to fully compensate for the increasing methane production by methanogens. Net methane fluxes showed a strong temperature-dependence, with higher methane fluxes at higher temperatures. After removal of Sphagnum, methane fluxes were higher, increasing with increasing temperature. This indicates that the methanotrophs associated with Sphagnum plants play an important role in limiting the net methane flux from peat. Methanotrophs appear to consume almost all methane transported through diffusion between 5 and 15 degrees C. Still, even though methane consumption increased with increasing temperature, the higher fluxes from the methane producing microbes could not be balanced by methanotrophic activity. The efficiency of the Sphagnum-methanotroph consortium as a filter for methane escape thus decreases with increasing temperature. Whereas 98% of the produced methane is retained at 5 degrees C, this drops to approximately 50% at 25 degrees C. This implies that warming at the mid to high latitudes may be enhanced through increased methane release from peat bogs.

AB Vegetation and water table are important regulators of methane emission in peatlands. Microform variation encompasses these factors in small-scale topographic gradients of dry hummocks, intermediate lawns and wet hollows. We examined methane production and oxidization among microforms in four boreal bogs that showed more variation of vegetation within a bog with microform than between the bogs. Potential methane production was low and differed among bogs but not consistently with microform. Methane oxidation followed water table position with microform, showing higher rates closer to surface in lawns and hollows than in hummocks. Methanogen community, analysed by mcrA terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and dominated by Methanoregulaceae or 'Methanoflorentaceae', varied strongly with bog. The extent of microform-related variation of methanogens depended on the bog. Methanotrophs identified as Methylocystis spp. in pmoA denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis similarly showed effect of bog, and microform patterns were stronger within individual bogs. Our results suggest that methane-cycling microbes in boreal Sphagnum bogs with seemingly uniform environmental conditions may show strong site-dependent variation. The bog-intrinsic factor may be related to carbon availability but contrary to expectations appears to be unrelated to current surface vegetation, calling attention to the origin of carbon substrates for microbes in bogs.

AB Methane emissions from mires in all climate-vegetation zones of West Siberia (forest steppe, subtaiga, south taiga, middle taiga, north taiga, forest tundra and tundra) were measured using a static chamber method. The observed fluxes varied considerably from small negative values in forested bogs and palsa to hundreds of mgC m(-2) h(-1) in ponds and wet hollows. Observed data were consolidated in the form of the empirical model of methane emissions designated as the 'standard model'. The model is based on medians of CH4 flux distributions of eight different micro-landscape types depending on their location and estimated duration of methane emission period within the climate-vegetation zone. The current version (Bc8) of the 'standard model' estimates methane flux from West Siberia mires at 2.93 +/- 0.97 TgC CH4 yr(-1) that accounts for about 2.4% of the total methane emission from all mires or 0.7% of global methane emission from all sources.

AB Peatland degradation is expected to increase the rate of aerobic decomposition in surface soil (0-30 cm). Carbon stored in both the subsurface (30-60 cm) and deeper layers ( > 60 cm) of peatlands is also expected to be metabolized after degradation. However, little is known about how methane were emissions from subsurface and the deeper layers of peatlands during degradation. Three peatland degradation stages: S1, intact fen with high water table; S2, lightly degraded fen with a fluctuating water table; S3, heavily degraded fen with a lower water table were chosen to quantify the differences in CH4 emissions at different peatland degradation stages. CH4 emissions and methanogens of subsurface and deep soil were also measured to reveal the contribution rates of subsurface methane emission in this study. After four-years experiment, we found that the abundance of methanogens and methane emissions decreased as peatlands were more heavily degraded. We also found that the contribution rate of methane emission decreased from peat surface to subsurface and deep layer, and this trend varied with peatland degradation. A higher contribution rate was found in the subsurface methane emissions from S1 (32.63%) and S2 (19.94%). Importantly, when peatlands were heavily degraded, the subsurface changed from a CH4 source to a sink. Decreased methane emissions of the degraded peatlands was also associated with a high abundance of methanogens (R-2 = 0.75, p < 0.05). Thus, we conclude that peatland degradation reduces methanogens and methane emissions from both surface and deep soils. Peatland degradation induced aerobic condition and substrate limitation are the main reasons for the reduced methane emission from Zoige peatland.

AB Spatial and temporal variations in the concentrations of dissolved gases (CH4, CO2, and O-2) in peat cores were studied using membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MLMS). Variations in vertical gas profiles were observed between random peat cores taken from hollows on the same peat bog. Methane concentrations in profiles (0-30 cm) generally increased with depth and reached maximum values in the range of 200-450 mu M CH4 below about 13-cm depth. In some profiles, a peak of dissolved methane was observed at 7-cm depth, Oxygen penetrated to approximately 2-cm depth in the hollows. The sampling probe was used to continuously monitor CH4, CO2, and O-2 concentrations at fixed depths in peat cores over periods of several days. The concentration of dissolved CO2 and O-2 at 1-cm depth oscillated over a 24-h period with the maximum of CO, concentration corresponding with the minimum of O-2 Diurnal variations in CO2 but not CH4 were measured at 15-cm depth; dissolved CO2 levels decreased during daylight hours to a constant minimum concentration of 4.85 mM. This report also describes the application of MIMS for the measurement of gaseous diffusion rates in peat using an inert gas (argon); the value of D, the diffusion coefficient, was 2.07 x 10(-8) m(2) s(-1).

AB Peatland methane emissions have been proposed to decrease during summer drought as the onset of more aerobic conditions causes enhanced methane oxidation and suppressed methane production. However, emissions often fail to return to pre-drought levels for a year or more after the water table has retained to the peat surface and conditions favourable for methane production have been restored. Droughts release sulphate into the soil solution, and such increases in sulphate abundance could stimulate sulphate-reducing bacteria. These microbes are known to compete with methanogens for access to organic substrates. To examine whether this effect could continue to cause suppression of methanogenesis even after a drought, peat cores from a gully mire were incubated with either (a) the water table held at the surface of the peat, or (b) with a lowered water table for 4 weeks, followed by a period of rewetting. After a brief pulse of high methane release, methane emissions were confirmed to decrease during the drought, and to remain lower than the control emission rates throughout the rewetting period. Addition of an inhibitor of sulphate-reducing bacteria (molybdate) to the peat core slurries confirmed that sulphate reduction was significantly impairing methanogenesis and that this effect can persist longer than the end of a drought. However, low primary production during drought may be more important than the impact of sulphate in suppressing peatland methane emissions following drought. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB There are still large uncertainties in peatland methane flux dynamics and insufficient understanding of how biogeochemical processes scale to ecosystems. New Zealand bogs differ from Northern Hemisphere ombrotrophic systems in climatic setting, hydrology, and dominant vegetation, offering an opportunity to evaluate our knowledge of peatland methane biogeochemistry gained primarily from northern bogs and fens. We report eddy covariance methane fluxes from a raised bog in New Zealand over 2.5years. Annual total methane flux in 2012 was 29.1gCH(4)m(-2)yr(-1), whereas during a year with a severe drought (2013) it was 20.6gCH(4)m(-2)yr(-1), both high compared to Northern Hemisphere bogs and fens. Drier conditions led to a decrease in fluxes from similar to 100mgCH(4)m(-2)d(-1) to similar to 20mgCH(4)m(-2)d(-1), and subsequent slow recovery of flux after postdrought water table rise. Water table depth regulated the temperature sensitivity of methane fluxes, and this sensitivity was greatest when the water table was within 100mm of the surface, corresponding to the shallow rooting zone of the dominant vegetation. A correlation between daytime CO2 uptake and methane fluxes emerged during times with shallow water tables, suggesting that controls on methane production were critical in determining fluxes, more so than oxidation. Water table recession through this shallow zone led to increasing methane fluxes, whereas changes in temperature during these periods were not correlated. Models of methane fluxes should consider drought-induced lags in seasonal flux recovery that depend on drought characteristics and location of the critical zone for methane production.

AB Winter fluxes of methane were investigated in northern Minnesota during 1988-89 and 1989-90. Two bogs and a fen emitted methane throughout the snow-covered season (November through March). Fluxes decreased to a low level of 3-16 mg CH4 m-2 d-1 in late March, reflecting decreasing peat temperatures and (in 1989-90) increasing depth of frost in the peat. Winter fluxes calculated by integration for an open poor fen, an open bog, a forested bog hollow, and a hummock site in the forested bog averaged 49, 12, 13, and 5 mg m-2 d-1, respectively, in 1989-90 (the year most measurements were made). These comprised 11%, 4%,15%, and 21% of total annual flux.

AB Although studies have shown that peatland drainage and harvesting alter local hydrology, microclimate, and peat characteristics, little is known about the effects of these changes on CO2 production rates. This study examines the different factors affecting CO2 production from natural and cutover peatlands. Laboratory peat incubations were performed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions to determine the influence of temperature, soil moisture, and peat depth on CO2 production rates from peat samples taken from: (1) a natural peatland; (2) a 2-year post-cutover peatland and; (3) a 7-year post-cutover peatland.
   CO2 production rates ranged from 0.21 to 4.87 mu mol g(-1) d(-1) under anaerobic conditions, and from 0.37 to 15.69 mu mol g(-1) d(-1) in the aerobic trials. While no significant differences were found between the CO2 production rates of the two cutover sites, the natural site consistently displayed higher production values. The natural site was also the only site to exhibit strong depth dependent trends, thus indicating the importance of the upper peat layer with respect to substrate quality. Higher production rates were found under aerobic than anaerobic conditions, with the greatest response to oxygen observed at the natural site. Production rates increased with both temperature and soil moisture, with maximum production rates found at 20 degreesC and 92% moisture content. Temperature responses were generally greater at the cutover sites, while soil moisture had greater effects on the natural site peat.
   Results of this work agree with previous studies that suggest that it is essential to begin restoration once a cutover peatland is abandoned. Re-wetting a cutover peatland (through restoration practices) is necessary to prevent an increase in peat temperature and CO2 production since cutover peat has higher Q(10) values than natural peat. A decrease in overall peatland oxidation should reduce the persistent source of atmospheric CO2 from cutover peatlands and the irreversible changes in peat structure that impede Sphagnum re-establishment.

AB The sensitivity of peatland carbon (C) fluxes to changes in climate and hydrology are uncertain due to the complex interactions between plants and peat properties. In this study we examine how peat cores taken from under three plant functional types (PFT) (bryophyte, graminoid and ericoid) differ in their biotic and abiotic properties and how this indirectly modulates the response of C fluxes to environmental change. Peat cores taken from under three PFTs had their aboveground vegetation removed to exclude direct plant-mediated effects, and were incubated in a temperature x water table factorial experiment at 12, 14 and 16 degrees C (air temperature) with the water table level -25, -15 or -5 cm below the peat surface. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured over 11 months. Emissions of CO(2)and CH(4)increased with temperature, with strong positive (CH4) and negative (CO2) interactions with increasing water table level. There were significant effects of removed PFT on the environmental sensitivity of CH4, but not CO(2)fluxes. CH(4)emissions were greatest in peat with graminoid PFT removed at the warmest temperature but these indirect effects were not explained by peat abiotic or biotic properties, which did not differ between PFTs. These results show that climate change-induced expansion of graminoids in northern peatlands will have direct and indirect effects on C fluxes and the stability of peatland C stores. These responses will be determined by the interactive effects of vegetation composition, hydrology and warming on methane-cycling microbial communities. Highlights
   Peatland carbon flux strength under a changing climate is influenced by PFT. Peat from under graminoid PFT emits more methane than peat from under bryophyte or ericoid PFT. Prior PFT cover influenced methane emissions, but did not affect peat abiotic or biotic properties. Increases in graminoid cover with climate change could indirectly increase peatland methane fluxes.

AB Drainage of peatlands for agriculture causes an increase of CO2 flux from peat decomposition, contributing to national CO2 emission. The reverse process, i.e. for re-creation of wetlands, reduces the CO2 flux, but increases the CH4 flux. We developed a process model (PEATLAND) to simulate these fluxes from peat soils subject to different water-table management scenarios. The model combines primary production, aerobic decomposition of soil organic matter (including the soil-parent material, peat), CH4 formation, oxidation, and transport. Model input requires specification of water table and air temperature data sets, vegetation parameters such as primary production and parameters related to gas transport, and basic soil physical data. Validation using closed flux-chamber measurements Of CO2 and CH4 from five different sites in the western Netherlands shows that seasonal changes in fluxes Of CO2 and CH4 are correctly modelled. However, the CO2 submodel underestimates peat decomposition when peat decomposition rates obtained from laboratory incubation experiments are used as input. Field decomposition rates are considerably higher. This is attributed to enhancement of decomposition by the addition of easily decomposable material from root exudation ('priming effect'). Model experiments indicate that 1) drainage increases the CO2 production from peat decomposition strongly; 2) restoring a high water table may decrease the total greenhouse gas flux by a small amount although the CH4 flux increases strongly; 3) a warmer climate may cause higher greenhouse gas fluxes from peat soils resulting in a positive feedback to climate warming, and 4) high vegetation productivity in fen meadows may stimulate peat decomposition by the priming effect.

AB This study evaluates relationships between vegetation and stable isotope distribution within a large, northern peat-accumulating wetland. Concentration and delta(13)C for both porewater and emitted methane were obtained from June-September for two systems characterized by different plant assemblages and hydrologic regimes: a Carer-dominated fen and a Sphagnum-dominated, forested bog crest. Average methane emissions were higher in the fen than at the bog crest across the entire growing season. Fen porewater methane concentrations were maintained at consistently low levels in the upper one-third of the peat column, and emitted methane was substantially C-13-depleted (by approx. 6 parts per thousand) relative to shallow porewater methane, trends which are characteristic of passive plant-mediated transport of rhizospheric methane to the atmosphere. Fen porewater delta(13)C-CH4 values in shallow pear (approx. -59 parts per thousand) suggest that microbial respiration was primarily driven by acetate fermentation. CO2 reduction became more important deeper in the peat column with delta(13)C-CH4 values ranging from approx. -65 to -69 parts per thousand between 1 and 2.8 m. In contrast to the fen, porewater methane concentrations in the bog were usually at near-maximum levels just below the water table. delta(13)C values for emitted CH4 in the bog were enriched relative to those for shallow porewater CH4 by approx. 10 parts per thousand, indicating that methane was subject to oxidation as it exited from the pear via passive diffusion. Methanogenesis in the peat at the bog crest appears to have been substrate-limited, with porewater delta(13)C-CH4 (approx. -67 parts per thousand) suggestive of CO2 reduction at all depths.

AB (1) Huge reductions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) effluxes can be attained by rewetting drained peatlands, but this will increase methane (CH4) effluxes.
   (2) The scientific data base for methane effluxes from peatlands is much larger than that for CO2 or N2O. Once anoxic conditions are provided, the availability of fresh plant material is the major factor in methane production. Old (recalcitrant) peat plays only a subordinate role in gas efflux.
   (3) The annual mean water level is a surprisingly good indicator for methane effluxes, but at high water levels the cover of aerenchymous shunts (gas conductive plant tissue) becomes a better proxy. Ideally, both water level and cover of aerenchymous shunts should be assessed to arrive at robust estimates of methane effluxes.
   (4) The available data provide sufficient guidance for arriving at moderately accurate (Tier 1) estimates consistent with IPCC methodologies. For more accurate estimation (higher tier approaches), vegetation provides a promising basis for development of more detailed efflux factors. Vegetation is a good proxy for mean water levels and can provide - with extra attention to aerenchymous shunts - a robust proxy for accurate and spatially explicit estimates of methane effluxes over large areas.

AB In the summer-autumn seasons of 2007-2011, the methane emission from typical mire landscapes of Western Siberia was studied using the static chamber method. The lowest methane flux turned out to be characteristic of the ryams (pine-dwarf shrub-sphagnum associations) and the ridges of the ridge-hollow complexes, as well as of the wetland lakes in the northern and middle taiga (the medians are within the range of 0.1-0.5 mg C-CH4/m(2) h). Values that are 10 times higher are typical for the oligotrophic hollows, fens, peat mats, and poor fens in different subzones (the medians are 2 to 7 mg C-CH4/m(2) h). The maximal values of the methane flux from the wetland lakes of the southern taiga are 17.98 mg C-CH4/m(2) h. Based on the data obtained by the authors, along with the previously published ones, the regional methane fluxes from the taiga mires were calculated: 2.22 Mt C-CH4/m(2) per year, or about 80% of the total methane flux from the West Siberian mires. The estimates of the CH4 regional flux obtained by other researchers are discussed; the main source of the estimation uncertainty is analyzed.

AB Although temporal and spatial variations in peatland methane (CH4) emissions at broad scales are often related to water table (WT) using a linear relationship, a potentially complex relationship exists between these variables locally and over shorter time scales. To explore this issue, CH4 fluxes were measured using eddy covariance at the Mer Bleue bog over two summer seasons. Peak CH4 emissions (30 to 50 mg CH4-C m-2 d-1) occurred not when the WT was closest to the surface but instead, when it dropped to 40 to 55 cm below the surface. When the WT was below or above this zone, average fluxes were similar to 14 mg CH4-C m-2 d-1. We speculate this critical zone coincides with the necessary redox potentials and sources of fresh organic material that lead to maximum production of CH4 and/or with conditions that lead to degassing of stored CH4. However, as expected, total summer CH4 emissions were 47% lower during the drier year. This occurred in part because the WT was within the critical zone for fewer days in the drier year but also because after an extended midsummer dry period there was little recovery of CH4 emissions, even a month after rewetting.

AB Results of measuring methane emissions from the Lammin-Suo oligotrophic bog massif are considered. It is shown that emission intensity depends on the methane transport from the active layer of the peat bed. The highest emission intensity is observed in the sedge-sphagnum microlandscape and over swampy hollows of the hummock-ridge complex. It is found that the methane flux intensity approaches zero when the wetland level drops by 30-35 cm from the bog surface. Spatial methane emission variability is estimated within dominating bog landscapes. The methane emission reaches its maximum values (207%) in microlandscapes with oriented microrelief (hummock-ridge complex); in the central bog (sphagnum-suffrutescent-cottongrass landscape afforested with pine), it reaches its lowest level (76%). A model of methane emissions from bogs is developed. The model has been verified from the observational data. The comparison of model calculations with experimental data is indicative of their good agreement, which makes it possible to use the model in different calculations and assessments of the influence of natural factors on the methane emission intensity.

AB The role of boreal wetlands in driving variations in atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations across the last deglaciation (20-10 ka) and the Holocene is debated. Most studies infer the sources of atmospheric methane via ice-core records of methane concentration and its light stable isotopic composition. However, direct evidence for variations in the methane cycle from the wetlands themselves is relatively limited. Here, we used a suite of biomarker proxies to reconstruct the methane cycle in the Chinese Hani peat across the past 16 k.y. We found two periods of enhanced methanogenesis, at ca. 15-11 ka and ca. 10-6 ka, whereas weak methanogenesis characterized the late Holocene. These periods of enhanced methanogenesis relate to periods of high/increasing temperatures, supporting a temperature control on the wetland methane cycle. We found no biomarker evidence for intense methanotrophy throughout the past 16 k.y., and, contrary to previous studies, we found no clear control of hydrology on the peatland methane cycle. Although the onset of methanogenesis at Hani at ca. 15 ka coincided with a negative shift in methane delta C-13 in the ice cores, there is no consistent correlation between changes in the reconstructed methane cycle of the boreal Hani peat and atmospheric CH4 concentrations.

AB Low affinity methanotrophic bacteria consume a significant quantity of methane in wetland soils in the vicinity of plant roots and at the oxic-anoxic interface. Estimates of the efficiency of methanotrophy in peat soils vary widely in part because of differences in approaches employed to quantify methane cycling. High resolution profiles of dissolved methane abundance measured during the summer of 2003 were used to quantity rates of upward methane flux in four peatlands situated in Wales, UK. Aerobic incubations of peat from a minerotrophic and an ombrotrophic mire were used to determine depth distributions of kinetic parameters associated with methane oxidation. The capacity for methanotrophy in a 3 cm thick zone immediately beneath the depth of nil methane abundance in pore water was significantly greater than the rate of upward diffusion of methane in all four peatlands. Rates of methane diffusion in pore water at the minerotrophic peatlands were small (<10%) compared to surface emissions during June to August. The proportions were notably greater in the ombrotrophic bogs because of their typically low methane emission rates. Methanotrophy appears to consume entirely methane transported by pore water diffusion in the four peatlands with the exception of 4 of the 33 gas profiles sampled. Flux rates to the atmosphere regardless are high because of gas transport through vascular plants, in particular, at the minerotrophic sites. Cumulative rainfall amount 3-days prior to sampling correlated well with the distance between the water table level and the depth of 0 mu mol l(-1) methane, indicating that precipitation events can impact methane distributions in pore water. Further work is needed to characterise the kinetics of methane oxidation spatially and temporally in different wetland types in order to determine generalized relationships for methanotrophy in peatlands that can be incorporated into process-based models of methane cycling in peat soils.

AB We discuss the results from natural experiments on determination of methane emission and its content in the main types of microlandscapes of raised bogs in Pskov oblast. The methane concentration in peat waters in the upper soil horizon varied, respectively from 17 to 7600 mu L/L and from < 0.01 to 33 mu g/g of wet weight, with maximum values in heavily waterlogged microlandscapes of transitional moors, black water holes of the string-bog complex and in lakelets of the lake-denudation complex. The rate of methane emission into the atmosphere varied from < 0.1 to 87.7 mg/m per hour and, generally, correlated closely with its concentrations in peat waters and in the surface layer of earth materials in the microlandscapes under study.

AB The methane emission from typical bog landscapes of the West Siberian subtaiga was studied in the summer-autumn of 2007-2010. The lowest specific fluxes (the median value is 0.08 mg C-CH4/m(2) per h) were recorded from ryams (raised bogs with dwarf shrub-sphagnum associations). From the ridges of the ridge-pool complexes, the fluxes were estimated at 0.49 mg C-CH4/m(2) per h; from the oligotrophic hollows, eutrophic bogs, floating lake mats, and mesotrophic quaking bogs, they were estimated at 2.68, 3.36, 4.53, and 4.98 mg C-CH4/m(2) per h, respectively. The maximal flux was determined from the lakes (the median is 17.98 mg C-CH4/m(2) per h). The regional assessment of the methane flux from the bogs of Western Siberia (2.93 Tg C-CH4/yr) was obtained on the basis of the authors' and literature data.

AB Measurements of methane flux from northern peatlands to the atmosphere are complicated by high spatial and temporal variability. We quantified the variability of methane flux from two subarctic fens near Schefferville, northern Quebec, using a static chamber technique. Within the seasonal pattern of increasing fluxes associated with the warming of the peat profile, episodic fluxes of methane were observed. One set of episodic events occurred during the spring thaw of the upper layers of the peat, which released methane stored in ice over the winter. The second set, generally of short duration (< 2 d), occurred in mid-summer and appeared to be related primarily to the lowering of the water table. In four of six subjectively-identified, episodic fluxes during the 1990 summer, the flux during the episodic event was equal to or greater than the upper 95 % confidence level of the three fluxes before and after the event (t-statistic probabilities ranged from < 0.001 to 0.038). Mechanisms to account for these episodic fluxes of methane include increased methane diffusivity, removal of over-burden pressure and reduced rates of methane consumption in the surface layers of the peat. Omission of these episodic fluxes could lower estimates of seasonal methane emissions by 7-22%.

AB There is widespread interest in estimating annual carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) budgets for peatlands using data collected from flux chambers. Flux-chamber measurements are a snapshot of the conditions on a particular site and may not adequately represent fluxes between measurements. However, these measurements can be used in simple models to estimate time-integrated fluxes of CO2 and CH4. This paper reviews modelling approaches used for estimating such time-integrated fluxes and provides what we hope is a 'one-stop-shop' for new researchers, such as PhD students, considering using such models. The review is written for those with a non-mathematical background.

AB The influence of various ecological factors (air and soil temperature, atmospheric pressure, level of peatland waters, and the content of CO2 in the atmosphere) on the emission of CO2 from the surface of a peat deposit of an oligotrophic peatland in the south taiga subzone of West Siberia was studied. On the basis of the investigations, day and seasonal dynamics of the emission of CO2 from the surface of the peat deposit were revealed. A detailed correlation analysis allowed us to describe the dependences of the CO2 flux from the surface of the peat deposit on the environmental parameters at various levels of averaging: hour, day, and month. It was shown that the temperature of the air and surface of the peat deposit have a reliable impact on the emission of CO2 on all time scales. The atmospheric pressure, as a factor that changes relatively slowly, influences the emission of CO2 weakly. The performed studies did not allow us to draw an unambiguous conclusion about the influence of the level of bog waters on the emission of CO2 from the surface of a peat deposit.

AB A national land use inventory program was used to estimate the flux of methane from Swedish mires. During the snow-free season in 1994, methane fluxes were monitored at 60% (n = 619) of the total number of permanent inventory plots for the four mire vegetation classes included. The methane flux was measured only once at each inventory plot using transparent static chambers, yielding 3157 (89%) accepted flux rates. The temperature during the measurement period was close to the long-term (30 year) average in the north and much warmer in the south. The precipitation was lower than the long-term average. Average flux rates, specific for each mire vegetation class and geographical region, varied between 8 and 238 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). The national averages +/- SE (mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) were hummock communities, 24 +/- 6; transitional fens, 15 +/- 2; short sedge fens, 49 +/- 4; and tall sedge fens, 97 +/- 22. To derive the annual flux, the number of days with a daily average air temperature over 5 degreesC was used. The annual methane fluxes for each mire vegetation class and region varied between 1.5 and 40 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1). The annual methane fluxes (average +/- SE in g m(-2) yr(-1)) for each mire vegetation class for the whole of Sweden were hummock sites, 4.9 +/- 1.3; transitional fens, 2.5 +/- 0.5; low sedge fens, 8.2 +/- 0.8; and tall sedge fens, 16.5 +/- 3.6. The methane flux (+/- 95% confidence limits) in 1994 from the monitored mire types in Sweden was 0.29 +/- 0.05 Tg CH4. The low and tall sedge mires accounted for 96% of the methane emitted.

DE CARBON DIOXIDE; METHANE; NITROUS OXIDE; CLIMATIC CHANGE; PEATLANDS
AB The emission of three trace gases, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide; and methane, from peatlands is examined, identifying the primary controls and the potential effect of climatic change on emission rates. Nitrous oxide emission from natural peatlands is small and tied to the cycling of nitrogen but increases upon disturbance such as drainage. Peatlands generally act as a sink for carbon dioxide, but they convert from a sink to a source upon drainage. Methane emissions are controlled primarily by position of the water table, with secondary controls of temperature and trophic status of the peat. Canadian and other northern peatlands play a moderately important role in the global methane budget. Climatic change, such as increases in temperature and precipitation predicted by 2 x CO2 scenarios, may result in increased emissions of nitrous oxide, decreased carbon dioxide storage, and reduced methane emissions from Canadian peatlands.

AB We conducted a multi-year study in two boreal peatlands to determine the impacts of resource access roads on methane (CH4) emission from adjacent peatland. Data were collected from transects aligned perpendicular to, and on both sides of two roads, one cutting through a bog and one cutting through a fen and from reference areas at each peatland. During the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017, we measured CH4 flux, water table, and peat temperature every second week. At the bog, the road associated impacts (changes to water table, peat temperature, and vegetation cover) were visible up to 20 m on both sides of the road (disturbed areas) with CH4 emission from disturbed areas being significantly higher compared to the reference areas in both years. There were no significant differences in CH4 emissions from disturbed areas compared to reference areas at the fen due to the limited hydrologic impact of the road crossing at this site. Bog plots located upstream of the road on transects located at >20 m from culverts and closer to the road emitted significantly more CH4 (124.6-mg CH4.m(-2).day(-1)) than other disturbed (10.2 mg CH4.m(-2).day(-1)) and reference areas (0.7-mg CH4.m(-2).day(-1)) due to shallower water table and warmer peat temperature. The road induced CH4 emissions (90.8 and 212.2 kg CH4/year for each kilometer of road, in 2016 and 2017, respectively) indicated that road construction across peatlands enhances CH4 emissions from these ecosystems, creating an additional source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas.
   Plain Language Summary Construction of resource access roads is common across the boreal region of Canada, and significant numbers of these roads are passing through peatlands. Peatlands are natural sources of methane, which is one of the important greenhouse gases. To determine the impacts of resource access roads on methane emission from the adjacent peatland, we conducted a study in two boreal forested peatlands (a bog and a fen). Our results showed that, at the bog, methane emission from disturbed areas were significantly higher compared to the reference areas. Similarly, the changes to the water table, peat temperature, and vegetation cover were visible up to 20 m on both sides of the road. In contrast, we did not find differences in methane emissions from disturbed areas compared to reference areas at the fen due to the limited hydrologic impact of the road crossing at this site. The increased methane emission from road adjacent areas indicates that road construction across peatlands enhances methane emissions from these ecosystems, creating an additional source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas. However, our study showed that aligning roads parallel to water flow when and where possible, and adequate culvert placement can help to minimize induced methane emissions.

AB Peatlands are among the largest natural sources of atmospheric methane (CH4) worldwide. Peatland emissions are projected to increase under climate change, as rising temperatures and shifting precipitation accelerate microbial metabolic pathways favorable for CH(4)production. However, how these changing environmental factors will impact peatland emissions over the long term remains unknown. Here, we investigate a novel data set spanning an exceptionally long 11 years to analyze the influence of soil temperature and water table elevation on peatland CH(4)emissions. We show that higher water tables dampen the springtime increases in CH(4)emissions as well as their subsequent decreases during late summer to fall. These results imply that any hydroclimatological changes in northern peatlands that shift seasonal water availability from winter to summer will increase annual CH(4)emissions, even if temperature remains unchanged. Therefore, advancing hydrological understanding in peatland watersheds will be crucial for improving predictions of CH(4)emissions.

AB Flooding of a small boreal forest wetland (979) in northwestern Ontario, caused the formation of peat islands, which resulted in an approximate 10 degrees C increase in peat temperatures at a depth of 50 cm. Feat collected from the flooded wetland and a natural unflooded wetland was incubated anaerobically at temperatures of 4 degrees C, 15 degrees C, and 20 to 25 degrees C. Flooding of the wetland greatly increased CH4 production rates by increasing the ratio of CH4 : CO2 produced from 979 peat (40% : 60%) compared to 632 peat (20% : 80%), at both preflood and postflood temperatures, likely due to the altered hydrological and geochemical conditions within the peat mats due to flooding. CH4 and CO2 production rates approximately tripled for every 10 degrees C temperature increase and may have been linked to to the metabolic rate of the methanogens or the fermenters independent of the substrate quality. Methane production rates from deep peat deposits within the islands were also significant and responded well to temperature increases despite peat C-14 ages of 1000 years. Due to the large quantity of carbon stored within natural wetlands, artificial reservoirs may act as a significant and long term source of CH4 to the atmosphere.

AB Aerobic symbiotic methane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) in peat moss (Sphagnum spp) play a vital role in the carbon cycle in peat bogs They reduce methane emissions and provide CO2 to Sphagnum moss, resulting in effective in situ carbon recycling To establish biomarkers for these methanotrophs, sphagnum moss spp were incubated with (CH4)-C-13 and analysed for the degree of label incorporation in individual lipids We determined that mono-unsaturated fatty acids (FAs, C16 1 omega 7 and C18 1 omega 7), hopenes [hop-17(21)-ene and 2-methylhop-17(21)-ene] and tetrafunctionalized hopanoids (detected as 17 beta,21 beta-bishomohopanol after H5IO6 and NaBH4 treatment) are probably the prevailing methanotroph lipids in Sphagnum moss spp However, they are not unique for methanotrophs, as they have been detected in other ;bacteria. Natural delta C-13 values of these lipids in Sphagnum range from -31 parts per thousand to -38 parts per thousand Their limited isotopic depletion is probably the result of a mixed origin On the other hand, an origin from senile cycle methanotrophs (type II) that fix both CO2 and CH4 and are, therefore, isotopically less depleted, would also be consistent with the observed isotopic values We have not been able to identify an unambiguous biomarker for methanotrophs in peat moss. Nevertheless, our results show that a limited depletion in C-13 for hopanoids does not exclude the presence of an active methanotrophic community. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Potential rates of methane production and carbon dioxide production were measured on 11 dates in 1986 in peat from six plant communities typical of moss-dominated peatlands in the Appalachian Mountains. Annual methane production ranged from 2.7 to 17.5 mol m(-2), and annual carbon dioxide production ranged from 30.6 to 79.0 mol m(-2). The wide range in methane production values among the communities found within a single peatland indicates that obtaining one production value for a peatland may not be appropriate. Low temperature constrained the potential for methane production in winter, while the chemical quality of the peat substrate appears to control methane production in the summer. Methane oxidation was measured throughout the peat profile to a depth of 30 cm. Values for methane oxidation ranged from 0.08 to 18.7 uM h(-1) among the six plant communities. Aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria probably mediated most of the activity. On a daily basis during the summer, between 11 and 100% of the methane produced is susceptible to oxidation within the peat column. Pools of dissolved methane and dissolved carbon dioxide in pore waters were less than 0.2 and less than 1.0 mol m(-2), respectively, indicating that methane does not accumulate in the pore waters. Peatlands have been considered as an important source of biologically produced methane. Despite the high rates of methane production, the high rates of methane oxidation dampen the potential emission of methane to the atmosphere.

AB Streams draining peatlands export large quantities of carbon in different chemical forms and are an important part of the carbon cycle. Radiocarbon (C-14) analysis/dating provides unique information on the source and rate that carbon is cycled through ecosystems, as has recently been demonstrated at the air-water interface through analysis of carbon dioxide (CO2) lost from peatland streams by evasion (degassing). Peatland streams also have the potential to release large amounts of methane (CH4) and, though C-14 analysis of CH4 emitted by ebullition (bubbling) has been previously reported, diffusive emissions have not. We describe methods that enable the C-14 analysis of CH4 evaded from peatland streams. Using these methods, we investigated the C-14 age and stable carbon isotope composition of both CH4 and CO2 evaded from a small peatland stream draining a temperate raised mire. Methane was aged between 1617 and 1987 years BP, and was much older than CO2 which had an age range of 303-521 years BP. Isotope mass balance modelling of the results indicated that the CO2 and CH4 evaded from the stream were derived from different source areas, with most evaded CO2 originating from younger layers located nearer the peat surface compared to CH4. The study demonstrates the insight that can be gained into peatland carbon cycling from a methodological development which enables dual isotope (C-14 and C-13) analysis of both CH4 and CO2 collected at the same time and in the same way.

AB The rewetting of drained peatlands alters peat geochemistry and often leads to sustained elevated methane emission. Although this methane is produced entirely by microbial activity, the distribution and abundance of methane-cycling microbes in rewetted peatlands, especially in fens, is rarely described. In this study, we compare the community composition and abundance of methane-cycling microbes in relation to peat porewater geochemistry in two rewetted fens in northeastern Germany, a coastal brackish fen and a freshwater riparian fen, with known high methane fluxes. We utilized 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on 16S rRNA, mcrA, and pmoA genes to determine microbial community composition and the abundance of total bacteria, methanogens, and methanotrophs. Electrical conductivity (EC) was more than 3 times higher in the coastal fen than in the riparian fen, averaging 5.3 and 1.5 mS cm(-1), respectively. Porewater concentrations of terminal electron acceptors (TEAs) varied within and among the fens. This was also reflected in similarly high intra- and inter-site variations of microbial community composition. Despite these differences in environmental conditions and electron acceptor availability, we found a low abundance of methanotrophs and a high abundance of methanogens, represented in particular by Methanosaetaceae, in both fens. This suggests that rapid (re) establishment of methanogens and slow (re) establishment of methanotrophs contributes to prolonged increased methane emissions following rewetting.

AB This study examined potential disturbances of methanotrophic communities playing a key role in reducing methane emissions from the peat bog Tasin Borskoye (Vladimir oblast, Russia), as a result of the wildfire in 2007. The potential activity of the methane-oxidizing filter in the burned peatland sites and the abundance of indigenous methanotrophic bacteria were significantly reduced in comparison to the undisturbed sites. Molecular analysis of the methanotrophic community structure by means of PCR amplification and cloning of the pmoA gene encoding particulate methane monooxygenase revealed the replacement of typical peat-inhabiting, acidophilic type II methanotrophic bacteria with type I methanotrophs, which are less active in acidic environments. In summary, both the structure and the activity of the methane-oxidizing filter in burned peatland sites underwent significant changes, which were clearly pronounced even after 7 years of the natural ecosystem recovery. These results point to the long-term character of the disturbances caused by wildfire in peatlands.

AB The influence of trophic status on CH(4) production, emission and stable carbon isotope composition was investigated in two ombrogenous and two minerotrophic peatlands situated in Wales, UK. Methane production and emission rates were highest in the minerotrophic peatlands and CH(4) in both pore water and emissions to the atmosphere were notably (13)C-enriched compared to the ombrogenous bogs. Highly negative delta(13) C values (- 95 to -82%) for CH(4) flux from the acidic rainfed peatlands likely resulted from a combination of CO(2)/H(2) methanogenesis and isotope effects associated with diffusion of CH(4) through aerenchymatous tissue of vascular flora. The delta(13) C values presently attributed to CH(4) flux from northern wetlands in isotope-weighted mass balance budgets of the CH(4) cycle may be too positive. Methane flux from northern bogs and fens should be assigned different delta(13) C values because CH(4) is notably more (13)C-depleted in the former, albeit emission strength typically is weaker.

AB Production of soil gases is important in nutrient and carbon cycling, particularly in peatlands due to their large atmospheric emissions of several greenhouse gases. We examined factors controlling aerobic and anaerobic soil respiration in three contrasting types of freshwater North Carolina peatland communities (short pocosins, tall pocosins and gum swamps) which occur along a natural soil nutrient availability gradient. Short pocosins occur in the ombrotrophic center of the bog complexes and are extremely nutrient-deficient; tall pocosins are slightly less nutrient-deficient; and gum swamps are relatively nutrient-rich. Short pocosin had the lowest soil CO2 production rates under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in laboratory experiments, while rates in tall pocosin were similar to or somewhat less than in the gum swamp. Methanogenesis rates were extremely low in laboratory experiments, and indicate that CH4 production is not a significant pathway of carbon flow in these peatlands. Methane production is also low in relation to other peatlands. Amendment experiments indicate that the poor substrate quality of the highly decomposed, humified peat limits both CO2 and CH4 production rates, even though the peat is 95% organic matter. Low soil nutrient concentrations and low pH do not directly limit soil respiration in these peatlands, although there is a positive feedback of nutrients with organic matter inputs and litter quality, causing greater soil respiration in nutrient-rich sites.
   In situ CO2 emissions similarly differed between the communities, with highest rates in the gum swamp and lowest rates in the pocosins. Emissions were highly seasonal with soil temperature explaining the majority of the temporal variability. Maximum potential CH, emission estimates derived from laboratory temperature relationships and in situ soil temperature data indicate that pocosins make an insignificant contribution to the global atmospheric CH4 flux. The continued existence of peatlands in warm climates may to a large extent depend on the low substrate quality of their soil organic matter, which maintains low decomposition rates under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

AB [1] The paper presents a process-based model describing methane flux dynamics in different microsites of boreal peatlands. The simulated fluxes matched well to measurements in all microsites without any parameter adjustment. The model emphasizes the importance of microsite characteristics, water table and vegetation cover for methane fluxes. Water level determines the moisture and oxygen profile in peat matrix and therefore affects methane production and oxidation rates in peat profile. Vascular plants provide methanogenesis with substrates, form a pathway for methane to liberate from peat to the atmosphere and enhance methane oxidation by transporting oxygen to water saturated peat. The model connects methane fluxes to the seasonal photosynthetic cycle of plants at the microsite level and hence dynamically combines the microbial processes in peat to changing environmental factors in the level of peatland ecosystem. Sensitivity analysis of the model reveals the importance of substrate supply to methane fluxes. In addition, the capability of the vascular plants to transport oxygen downwards has a large effect on model outcome. Lack of oxygen and methane keep methane oxidation at a low level in the model simulations, and changes that compensate for these lacks have a remarkable decreasing effect on simulated flux. Dry periods decrease the simulated methane flux considerably, especially if the drought prevails long, threshold for a dramatic decrease lying between 4 and 6 weeks of drought. Increase in air temperature enhances methane flux, especially if the effect of increased temperature on gross primary production is taken into account.

AB This study predicted the spatiotemporal changes in the CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the pristine peatlands throughout Finland during the 21st century based on 10 km x 10 km grids. The predictions are based on a regional carbon (C) model that emphasizes the mire-type differences in ecohydrology and biogeochemistry. The model was validated by field measurements performed at multiple sites in Finland. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the CO2 flux was more sensitive to changes in temperature than to changes in precipitation, and this temperature sensitivity is greater in fens than in bogs. Conversely, the CH4 emission from pristine fens is more sensitive to the changes in precipitation and temperature than pristine bogs. The spatiotemporal changes in the CO2 and CH4 fluxes were calculated based on the country-scale patterns of mire properties (i.e., fen-bog types, vegetation, topography and peat texture) and the ACCLIM climate change scenarios. The results indicate a decreasing CO2 sinks in the country-scale peatlands, and such a decrease will be most noticeable from 2060 to 2099. In addition, the annual CO2 sink value and the annual CH4 source value of the peatlands will decrease significantly in the western areas of the raised bog region, and such changes will be greater in the pristine fens than in pristine bogs. A large fraction of the fens in the raised-bog region and the southwestern part of the aapa-mire region has the potential to shift from CO2 sinks into weak CO2 sources (<20 g C m(-2) a(-1)) by the end of the 21st century. The transition of bogs from centurial CO2 sinks to sources is most notable near coastal areas. These bogs would function as CO2 sources at an average rate of over 40 g Cm-2 a(-1) for the 21st century under the changing climate scenario. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An understanding of the symbiotic water and gas exchange processes at the ecosystem scale is essential to the development of appropriate restoration plans of extracted peatlands. This paper presents ecosystem scale measurements of the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon dioxide (CO2) from a restored vacuum extracted peatland in eastern Quebec, utilizing full-scale micrometeorological measurements of both evaporation and CO2. The results indicate that the adopted restoration practices reduce the loss of water from the peat, but CO2 emissions are similar to 25% greater than an adjacent nonrestored comparison site. The blockage of drainage ditches and the existence of a mulch cover at the site keep the moisture conditions more or less constant. Consequently, the CO2 flux, which is predominantly soil respiration, is strongly controlled by peat temperature fluctuations. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB Astiani D, Burhanuddin, Taherdjadeh M, Curran LM. 2016. Effects of water table level on soil CO2 respiration in West Kalimantan forested and bare peatland: An experimental stage. Nusantara Bioscience 8: 201-206. Peatland forest is one of ecosystems that are susceptible to the alterations of water regimes. Our previous study demonstrated that hydrologic conditions are predominant variables in determining carbon respiration rates from peat soils. However, we have limited empirical measures of how hydrologic conditions (i. e., soil water table) affect the carbon respirations. A study had been conducted to ascertain the effects of water table levels on soil CO2 respirations of West Kalimantan coastal forested and bare peatland. We simulated natural intact peat core condition by designing 25 of "a double bucket" water level experiment using 5 levels of water tables (0-40cm) and measure soil CO2 respiration at soil surfaces. Results showed that water table levels significantly affected soil CO2 respiration, as well as peat microclimate conditions. Results also demonstrated that forest canopy had significant effects on reducing peat CO2 respiration through its function in maintaining site-environment conditions compared to bare peatland site. This study reveals that it is important to maintain peatland water level close to peat surface and to maintain forest/vegetation covered on peatlands to reduce soil CO2 emissions.

AB Drainage and peat harvesting may induce considerable changes in the fluxes to the atmosphere of the greenhouse gases CH4 and CO2 in peatlands. In this study, fluxes of CH4 and CO2 were measured with the closed chamber method in 6 Swedish peatlands that are being mined. Fluxes of CH4 were much higher from ditches than from mining "strips", i.e. emissions from ditches dominated in most peatlands. The total CH4 emission during the growing season (0.41 to 4.5 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)) was similar to emissions from virgin peatlands. Emissions from ditches can probably be kept low by keeping the ditches clear from vegetation. Like CH4, CO2 was released to the atmosphere from both ditches and strips in most peatlands. The total emission during the growing season (0.23 to 1.0 kg CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)) was strongly dominated by the strips. Compared to the total peat yield during mining these CO2 emission rates imply that on average ca 6% of the peat carbon is lost by microbial decomposition in the mire.

Flux measurements are carried out by the static chamber method every 7-10 days in three experimental sites with homogenous conditions of soil moisture and vegetation type. Statistically significant differences in CO2 fluxes and NEE are found between different experimental sites. It is shown that an assessment of the significance of bogs in CO2 balance with the atmosphere must be made with consideration for the spatial heterogeneity of bogs.

AB Effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration on northern peatland biogeochemistry was studied in a short-term experiment. Eight intact soil cores (11-cm diameter x 40-cm depth) with Juncus and Festuca spp. were collected from a calcareous fen in north Wales. Half of the cores were incubated under 350 ppm CO2 concentration, whilst the other four cores were maintained at 700 ppm CO2. After a 4-month incubation, significantly higher biomass (root + shoot + algal mat) was determined under elevated CO2 conditions. Higher emissions of N2O and CO2 and higher concentration of pore-water DOC (dissolved organic carbon) were also observed under elevated CO2. However, no significant differences were found in CH4 emission or soil enzyme activities (beta -glucosidase, phosphatase, and N-acetylglucosaminidase) in the bulk soil. Overall, the results suggest that elevated CO2 would increase the primary productivity of the fen vegetation, and stimulate N2O and CO2 emissions as a consequence of an enhanced DOC supply from the vegetation to the soil microbes.

AB Northern peatlands are Substantial sinks of carbon (C), yet the sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from peatlands are largely unknown. Since the relationship between roots and peat in C cycling is important, vascular plants growing on the surface of peat deposits should influence CO2 efflux from the peat surface and the overall C balance in peatlands. In our study, 30-cm peat cores were removed from an ombrotrophic bog in boreal, continental western Canada. Surface vegetation in the cores remained intact and included a continuous bryophyte cover dominated by Sphagnum fuscum. In addition, some cores were collected such that either ericaceous shrubs (Ledum groenlandicum) or sedges (Eriophorum vaginatum) were present. We investigated how the presence of each vegetation type influenced soil respiration and the microbial mineralization of root exudates using a pulse C-14 labeling of vegetation in the intact peat cores. The role of root biomass and toot respiration in CO2 emission and C allocation was quantified for each type of vegetation and compared through both measurement and modeling. Our results show that vascular plants contributed 35-57% of total CO2 efflux from the peat surface, primarily derived from rhizosphere processes, including root respiration as well as microbial mineralization of root exudates. The mineralization of root exudates contributed 14-53 mu mol C-CO(2)(.)m(-2).d(-1) (17-24% of total) to CO2 efflux, depending on vegetation type and moisture conditions. The type of vegetation present did not influence the total amount of photosynthetic fixation over the course of the study, but did affect how C was allocated within and between both the aboveground and belowground components of the peat column.

AB We measured seasonal patterns of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 in a diverse peatland complex underlain by discontinuous permafrost in northern Manitoba, Canada, as part of the Boreal Ecosystems Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). Study sites spanned the full range of peatland trophic and moisture gradients found in boreal environments from bog (pH 3.9) to rich fen (pH 7.2). During midseason (July-August, 1996), highest fates of NEE and respiration followed the trophic sequence of bog (5.4 to -3.9 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) < poor fen (6.3 to -6.5 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) < intermediate fen (10.5 to -7.8 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) < rich fen (14.9 to -8.7 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). The sequence changed during spring (May-June) and fall (September-October) when ericaceous shrub (e.g., Chamaedaphne calyculata) bogs and sedge (Carex spp.) communities in poor to intermediate fens had higher maximum CO2 fixation rates than deciduous shrub-dominated (Salix spp. and Betula spp.) rich fens. Timing of snowmelt and differential rates of peat surface thaw in microtopographic hummocks and hollows controlled the onset of carbon uptake in spring. Maximum photosynthesis and respiration were closely correlated throughout the growing season with a ratio of approximately 1/3 ecosystem respiration to maximum carbon uptake at all sites across the trophic gradient. Soil temperatures above the water table and timing of surface thaw and Freeze-up in the spring and fall were more important to net CO2 exchange than deep soil warming. This close coupling of maximum CO2 uptake and respiration to easily measurable variables, such as trophic status, peat temperature, and water table, will improve models of wetland carbon exchange. Although trophic status, aboveground net primary productivity, and surface temperatures were more important than water level in predicting respiration on a daily basis, the mean position of the water table was a good predictor (r(2) = 0.63) of mean respiration rates across the range of plant community and moisture gradients. Q(10) values ranged from 3.0 to 4.1 from bog to rich fen, but when normalized by above ground vascular plant biomass, the Q(10) for all sites was 3.3.

AB We investigate temporal changes in methane emissions over a three-year period from two peatlands in Michigan. Mean daily fluxes ranged from 0.6-68.4 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) in plant communities dominated by Chamaedapltne calyculata, an ericaceous shrub, to 11.5-209 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) in areas dominated by plants with aerenchymatous tissues, such as Carex oligosperma and Scheuchzeria palustris. Correlations between methane flux and water table position were significant at all sites for one annual cycle when water table fluctuations ranged from 15 cm above to 50 cm below the peat surface. Correlations were not significant during the second and third annual periods with smaller water table fluctuations. Methane flux was strongly correlated with peat temperatures at -5 to -40 cm (r(s) = 0.82 to 0.98) for all three years at sites with flora acting as conduits for methane transport. At shrub sites, the correlations between methane flux and pear temperature were weak to not significant during the first two years, but were strong in the third year.
   Low rates of methane consumption (-0.2 to -1.5 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) were observed at shrub sites when the water table was below -20 cm, while sites with plants capable of methane transport always had positive net fluxes of methane. The methane oxidizing potential at both types of sites was confirmed by pear core experiments. The results of this study indicate that methane emissions occur at rates that cannot be explained by diffusion alone; plant communities play a significant role in altering methane flux from peatland ecosystems by directly transporting methane from anaerobic pear to the atmosphere.

AB A process-based model (Forest-DNDC) was applied to describe the possible impacts of climate change on carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from a peat bog in European Russia. In the first step, Forest-DNDC was tested against CO2 fluxes measured by the eddy covariance method on an oligotrophic bog in a representative region of the southern taiga (56 degrees N33 degrees E). The results of model validations show that Forest-DNDC is capable of quantifying the CO2 fluxes from the bog ecosystem. In the second step, the validated model was used to estimate how the expected future changes of the air temperature and water table depth could affect the C dynamics in the bogs. It was shown that a decrease in the water table and an increase in temperature influence significantly the CO2 exchange between our bog ecosystem and the atmosphere. Under elevated temperature and deepened water table the bog ecosystems could become a significant source of atmospheric CO2.

   METHANOGENESIS
AB Boreal peatlands contain approximately 500Pg carbon (C) in the soil, emit globally significant quantities of methane (CH4), and are highly sensitive to climate change. Warming associated with global climate change is likely to increase the rate of the temperature-sensitive processes that decompose stored organic carbon and release carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4. Variation in the temperature sensitivity of CO2 and CH4 production and increased peat aerobicity due to enhanced growing-season evapotranspiration may alter the nature of peatland trace gas emission. As CH4 is a powerful greenhouse gas with 34 times the warming potential of CO2, it is critical to understand how factors associated with global change will influence surface CO2 and CH4 fluxes. Here, we leverage the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) climate change manipulation experiment to understand the impact of a 0-9 degrees C gradient in deep belowground warming (Deep Peat Heat, DPH) on peat surface CO2 and CH4 fluxes. We find that DPH treatments increased both CO2 and CH4 emission. Methane production was more sensitive to warming than CO2 production, decreasing the C-CO2:C-CH4 of the respired carbon. Methane production is dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis but deep peat warming increased the C-13 of CH4 suggesting an increasing contribution of acetoclastic methanogenesis to total CH4 production with warming. Although the total quantity of C emitted from the SPRUCE Bog as CH4 is <2%, CH4 represents >50% of seasonal C emissions in the highest-warming treatments when adjusted for CO2 equivalents on a 100-year timescale. These results suggest that warming in boreal regions may increase CH4 emissions from peatlands and result in a positive feedback to ongoing warming.

TI Long-term carbon loss and CO2-C release of drained peatland soils in

AB Peatlands are common in many parts of the world. Draining and other changes in the use of peatlands increase atmospheric CO2 concentration. If we are to make reliable quantitative predictions of that effect, we need good information on the CO2 emission rates from peatlands. The present study uses two different methods for predicting CO2-C release of peatland soils: (i) a 40-year field investigation of balancing organic carbon stocks and (ii) short-term CO2-C release rates from laboratory experiments. To estimate long-term losses of peat, and its resulting C input to the atmosphere, we combined highly detailed maps of surface topography and its changes, and the organic C contents and bulk densities of a drained peatland from different years. Short-term CO2-C release rates were measured in the laboratory by incubating soil samples from several soil horizons at various temperatures and soil moistures. We then derived nonlinear CO2-C production functions, which we incorporated into a numerical simulation model (HYDRUS). Using HYDRUS, we calculated daily soil water components and CO2-release for (i) real-climate data from 1950 to 2003 and (ii) a climate scenario extending to 2050, including an increase in temperature of 2 degrees C and 20% less rainfall during the summer half year, i.e. from April to September inclusive. From our field measurements, we found a mean annual decrease of 0.7 cm in the thickness of the peat. Large losses (> 1.5 cm year(-1)) occurred only during periods when groundwater levels were low (i.e. a deep water-table). The annual CO2-C release results in a mean loss from the peat of about 700 g CO2-C m(-2), mostly as a direct contribution to the atmosphere. Both methods produced very similar results. The model scenarios demonstrated that CO2-C loss is mainly controlled by the groundwater (i.e. water-table) depth, which controls subsurface aeration. A local climate scenario estimated a c. 5% increase of CO2-C losses within the next 50 years.

AB The potential aerobic methane oxidation (an estimate of the viable biomass of methane-oxidizing microorganisms) was assessed in various plant communities of a boreal, Sphagnum-dominated, mixed mire in Sweden. The relationships between potential oxidation and probable controlling environmental factors, such as water table depth, soil temperature and pore-water methane concentrations were also examined. Finally, the relationship between potential methane oxidation and the rate of net methane emission was evaluated. Potential methane oxidation ranged between 0.0 and 4.7 mu g CH4 g(-1) wet peat h(-1), and the areal estimates for the 0-40 cm depth interval ranged between 0.04 and 16 g CH4 m(-2) d(-1). The depth of maximal potential oxidation was correlated with the depth of the water table (r(2) = 0.64). Most communities showed a positive relationship between average rate of potential methane oxidation and water table depth (r(2) = 0.66), i.e. the greater the vertical extension of aerated surface peat, the higher the methane oxidation capacity. In non-waterlogged communities (water table more than 5 cm below the vegetation surface), a positive correlation was found between the potential oxidation and methane concentration in peat pore-water (r(2) = 0.44). These results suggest that the supplies of methane and oxygen largely control the biomass of methanotrophs across plant communities. Overall, net methane emission rates were negatively, but only weakly, correlated with the potential oxidation, suggesting that aerobic oxidation often controls emission rates from comparatively dry communities of Sphagnum peatlands, but that other factors also influence the emission.

AB Degraded peatlands are often rewetted to prevent oxidation of the peat, which reduces CO2 emission. However, the created anoxic conditions will boost methane (CH4) production and thus emission. Here, we show that submerged Sphagnum peat mosses in rewetted-submerged peatlands can reduce CH4 emission from peatlands with 93%. We were able to mimic the field situation in the laboratory by using a novel mesocosm set-up. By combining these with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and qPCR analysis of the pmoA and mmoX genes, we showed that submerged Sphagnum mosses act as a niche for CH4 oxidizing bacteria. The tight association between Sphagnum peat mosses and methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB) significantly reduces CH4 emissions by peatlands and can be studied in more detail in the mesocosm setup developed in this study.

AB The stable carbon isotopic composition of methane (delta C-13) emitted from two peatland sites in the Marcell Experimental Forest in northern Minnesota was investigated during the snow-free season of 1989-1990. A seasonal range in delta C-13 values of 13 %o was seen for a forested bog with heavier (C-13 enriched) methane emitted during the warmer summer months. This shift was correlated with water table level suggesting control by microbial oxidation. Methane from a nearby poor fen transitional to bog dominated by Carex oligosperma showed a similar temporal trend but with a much smaller range of 5 %o during the same time period and with no water table level correlation. The methane emitted from the fen was consistently heavier than that emitted by the bog. such as coal mining and natural seepage from gas reservoirs. Of the biogenic sources, wetlands appear to emit 13C depleted methane relative to the average delta C-13 composition of total methane emissions to the troposphere [Stevens and Engelkemeir, 1988; Cicerone and Oremland, 1988; Tyler, 1989]. Isotopic studies of methane emissions from wetlands have generally not taken into account possible seasonality in isotopic composition of the emitted methane. However, recent reports [Martens et al. 1986; Burke et al., 1988; Chanton and Martens, 1988] have shown that such seasonal changes occur in organic-rich marine and tidal freshwater sediments in temperate environments, apparently in response to variations in methane production rates and pathways. The objective of the present research was to seek evidence for similar seasonal shifts in the isotopic composition of methane emitted from two northern peatlands.

We have found a link between the methane emission rate and the changes in groundwater level (GWL) and soil temperature at a depth of 10-20 cm in seasonal dynamics. The total methane emission from April to October was 22.4 g m(-2); this value is higher than the values obtained by other authors in circumboreal peatland ecosystems.

AB The potential impact of an increase in methane emissions from natural wetlands on climate change models could be very large. We report a profound increase in methane emissions from cores of mire peat and vegetation as a direct result of increasing the CO2 concentration from 355 to 550 mu mol mol(-1) (a 60% increase). Increased CH4 fluxes were observed throughout the four month period of study. Seasonal variation in CH4 flux, consistent with that seen in the field, was observed under both ambient and elevated CO2. Under ambient CO2 methane fluxes rose from 0.02 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in May to 0.11 mu mol m(-2) s(-3) in July before declining again in August. Under elevated CO2, methane fluxes were at least 100% greater throughout the experiment, rising from 0.05 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in May to a peak of 0.27 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in July. The stimulation of CH4 emissions was accompanied by a 100% increase in rates of photosynthesis from 4.6 (+/- 0.3) under ambient CO2 to 9.3 (+/- 0.7) mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Root and shoot biomass were unaffected.

AB Peatlands are natural sources of atmospheric methane (CH4), an important greenhouse gas. It is established that peatland methane dynamics are controlled by both biotic and abiotic conditions, yet the interactive effect of these drivers is less studied and consequently poorly understood. Climate change affects the distribution of vascular plant functional types (PFTs) in peatlands. By removing specific PFTs, we assessed their effects on peat organic matter chemistry, microbial community composition and on potential methane production (PMP) and oxidation (PMO) in two microhabitats (lawns and hummocks). Whilst PFT removal only marginally altered the peat organic matter chemistry, we observed considerable changes in microbial community structure. This resulted in altered PMP and PMO. PMP was slightly lower when graminoids were removed, whilst PMO was highest in the absence of both vascular PFTs (graminoids and ericoids), but only in the hummocks. Path analyses demonstrate that different plant-soil interactions drive PMP and PMO in peatlands and that changes in biotic and abiotic factors can have auto-amplifying effects on current CH4 dynamics.Synthesis. Changing environmental conditions will, both directly and indirectly, affect peatland processes, causing unforeseen changes in CH4 dynamics. The resilience of peatland CH4 dynamics to environmental change therefore depends on the interaction between plant community composition and microbial communities.

AB Variations to the global wetland CH4 source strength in response to changes in orbital insolation patterns and atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2](a)) are hypothesized to play an important role in determining glacial-interglacial variations in atmospheric CH4 concentration ([CH4](a)). Here the interactive effects of temperature, a major controlling variable determining wetland CH4 flux, and the low [CO2](a) of glacial intervals are investigated for the first time. We measured the temperature dependence of CH4 emissions from replicated mesocosms (n = 8 per CO2 treatment) collected from a minerotrophic fen and an ombrotrophic bog incubated in either ambient (c. 400 ppm) or glacial (c. 200 ppm) [CO2](a) located in the United Kingdom. CH4 fluxes were measured at 5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 25 degrees C and then in reverse order over a 20 day period under each [CO2](a) treatment. Results showed that the Q(10) temperature response of CH4 emissions from the Carex/Juncus-dominated fen declined significantly by approximately 39% under glacial [CO2](a) (ambient [CO2](a) = 2.60, glacial [CO2](a) = 1.60; P < 0.01). By contrast, the response of CH4 emissions from the Sphagnum-dominated bog remained unaltered (ambient [CO2](a) = 3.67, glacial [CO2](a) = 3.67; P > 0.05). This contrasting response may be linked to differences in plant species assemblage and the varying impact of CO2 starvation on plant productivity and carbon availability in the rhizosphere. Furthermore, our results provide empirical evidence to support recent model-based indications that glacial-interglacial variations in [CH4](a) may be explained by changes in wetland CH4 source strength in response to orbitally forced changes in climate and [CO2](a).

AB Flooding of land associated with the creation of reservoirs may increase, at least in the short term, methane flux to the atmosphere. To evaluate the potential contribution of such land use on methane production, field samples were studied in vitro for the potential activity of methanogenic bacteria in unflooded or flooded boreal forest soils, together with lacustrine sediments. From this comparative study, periodically flooded or flooded peats contribute more to methane production than do unflooded peats, soils, and natural lake sediment. The intensity and temporal changes in the activity of methanogenic archaea in the different systems depended on a combination of environmental factors, such as the amount and quality of organic carbon, the water level, and the concentration of oxidizing ions (SO42-, Fe3+).

AB Fluxes of methane were measured by a static chamber technique at hummock, hollow, and lawn microtopographic locations in 12 peatland sites near Cochrane, northern Ontario, from May to October 1991. Average fluxes (mg . m-2 . d-1) were 2.3 (SD = 1.9) at hummocks, 44.4 (SD = 49.0) at hollows, and 15.6 (SD = 12.9) at lawns. Methane flux was negatively correlated with average water table position based on the 36 locations (r2 = 0.649, p < 0.001), with hummocks having a smaller flux than hollows or lawns, where the water table depth was < 25 cm. Peat samples from a bog hummock and hollow failed to produce methane during anaerobic incubations in the laboratory; samples from a poor fen hollow produced < 1.4 mug . g-1 . d-1. The production decreased with depth but was greater than the rates observed during the incubation of samples from an adjacent hummock. Rates of methane consumption during aerobic incubations ranged from 1 to 55 mug . g-1 . d-1 and were greatest in the surface layers and decreased with depth. Differences in methane emissions between hummocks and hollows appear to be controlled primarily by greater methane production rates in hollows compared with hummocks. Of secondary importance are the capacity of the peat profiles to consume methane during its transport to the peat surface and warmer temperatures at the water table beneath hollows compared with hummocks.

AB Recently, fen construction projects on surface mines in northeastern Alberta have been attempted as a reclamation strategy to reintroduce peatlands into the region where industry disturbs a substantial amount of wetland ecosystems. Knowledge of carbon cycling and greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics, including methane (CH4), is one way to understand the biogeochemical function of newly constructed fen ecosystems. In this study we monitored CH4 emissions and CH4 pore water concentration, as well as ecological and soil chemistry controls on CH4 emissions and pore water concentration, from a constructed fen. The same variables were also monitored at two natural reference fens that had similar vascular vegetation to the constructed fen. Methane emissions were lower at the constructed fen compared to the reference poor fen, but similar to the reference saline fen. However, CH4 concentration in pore water at 0.2 m and 0.7 m depth was lower at the constructed fen than either of the natural reference sites. The supply rate of sulfur (all mobile forms) was the most dominant control on CH4 emission and CH4 pore water concentration. While low CH4 emissions may be beneficial for constructed fens from a GHG perspective, this condition indicates that peat and carbon accumulation at these reclaimed sites may ensue slowly. Therefore, a clear statement of goals is required to determine how CH4 dynamics from constructed fen ecosystems relate to the reclamation outcome. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper summarises the results of several research groups participating in the research programme "Greenhouse Impacts of the use of Peat and Peatlands in Finland", and presents emission factors for peat-atmosphere fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O, filling gaps in knowledge concerning the afforestation of organic croplands and cutaways, and improves the emission assessment of peatlands drained for forestry. Forest drainage may result in net binding of soil carbon or net release, depending on site characteristics and the tree stand. Use of peatlands for agriculture (48-4821 g CO2-eq. m(-2) a(-1)), even after the cultivation has ceased, or for milled peat harvesting (1948-2478 g CO2-eq. m(-2) a(-1)) can cause the highest overall emissions. Extremely high CO2 emissions are possible from peat harvesting areas during wet and warm summers. Afforestation of those peatlands abandoned from cultivation or peat harvesting can reduce the warming impact at least during the first tree generation. Heterotrophic soil respiration may have a systematic south-north difference in temperature response. More data must be collected before the information on peatland forest soil CO 2 emissions can be adapted for different climatic regions in Finland. A test of the model DNDC against measured data showed that DNDC has to be developed further before it can be used in estimating N2O emissions from boreal peatlands.

AB Ombrotrophic peatlands are a recognized global carbon reservoir. Without restoration and peat regrowth, harvested peatlands are dramatically altered, impairing their carbon sink function, with consequences for methane turnover. Previous studies determined the impact of commercial mining on the physicochemical properties of peat and the effects on methane turnover. However, the response of the underlying microbial communities catalyzing methane production and oxidation have so far received little attention. We hypothesize that with the return of Sphagnum spp. postharvest, methane turnover potential and the corresponding microbial communities will converge in a natural and restored peatland. To address our hypothesis, we determined the potential methane production and oxidation rates in natural (as a reference), actively mined, abandoned, and restored peatlands over two consecutive years. In all sites, the methanogenic and methanotrophic population sizes were enumerated using quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays targeting the mcrA and pmoA genes, respectively. Shifts in the community composition were determined using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the mcrA gene and a pmoA-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-RFLP) analysis, complemented by cloning and sequence analysis of the mmoX gene. Peat mining adversely affected methane turnover potential, but the rates recovered in the restored site. The recovery in potential activity was reflected in the methanogenic and methanotrophic abundances. However, the microbial community composition was altered, being more pronounced for the methanotrophs. Overall, we observed a lag between the recovery of the methanogenic/methanotrophic activity and the return of the corresponding microbial communities, suggesting that a longer duration (>15 years) is needed to reverse mining-induced effects on the methane-cycling microbial communities.
   IMPORTANCE Ombrotrophic peatlands are a crucial carbon sink, but this environment is also a source of methane, an important greenhouse gas. Methane emission in peatlands is regulated by methane production and oxidation catalyzed by methanogens and methanotrophs, respectively. Methane-cycling microbial communities have been documented in natural peatlands. However, less is known of their response to peat mining and of the recovery of the community after restoration. Mining exerts an adverse impact on potential methane production and oxidation rates and on methanogenic and methanotrophic population abundances. Peat mining also induced a shift in the methane-cycling microbial community composition. Nevertheless, with the return of Sphagnum spp. in the restored site after 15 years, methanogenic and methanotrophic activity and population abundance recovered well. The recovery, however, was not fully reflected in the community composition, suggesting that >15 years are needed to reverse mining-induced effects.

ID PRODUCTS; TREES; SOILS
AB It is estimated that British peatlands, excluding lowland fens, contain about 3000 million tonnes of carbon, 76 per cent of which is in deep peats (> 45 cm deep) and 9 per cent of which has been drained and planted with trees.
   Undisturbed peatlands emit CH4 but accumulate CO2-derived carbon. The net greenhouse effect may be near zero. Peatland drainage virtually stops methane emission and increases CO2-carbon loss through aerobic decomposition, but can also increase CO2-carbon fixation by the peatland vegetation partly through microbial mineralization of nitrogen, resulting in either a net loss or gain in CO2-carbon.
   Planting conifer forests leads to an accumulation of CO2-derived carbon in the trees, wood products, litter and forest soil up to equilibrium values, totalling about 16.7 kg C m-2 for Picea sitchensis, Yield Class 12. Deep and shallow peats in the British uplands contain about 0.47 and 0.80 kg cm-2 per centimetre depth, respectively. Thus, the 16.7 kg C m-2 that is stored by P. sitchensis (Yield Class 12) is equivalent to the carbon stored in about 35.5 cm of deep peat or 20.9 cm of shallow peat. If forests are planted on peats substantially deeper than this, there could be a net loss of CO2-carbon in the long term.
   Scenarios are presented for the time course of CO2-carbon gain and loss when peatlands are drained and planted with conifers. If CO2 loss rates from drained peats are 50-100 g C m-2 a-1 there is likely to be increased carbon storage in the whole system for at least three rotations; but if CO2 loss rates are 200-300 g C m-2 a-1, increased storage may be restricted to the first rotation, after which there is a net loss of carbon.

AB Northern peatlands constitute a significant source of atmospheric methane (CH4). However, management of undisturbed peatlands, as well as the restoration of disturbed peatlands, will alter the exchange of CH4 with the atmosphere. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to collate and analyze published studies to improve our understanding of the factors that control CH4 emissions and the impacts of management on the gas flux from northern (latitude 40 degrees to 70 degrees N) peatlands. The analysis includes a total of 87 studies reporting measurements of CH4 emissions taken at 186 sites covering different countries, peatland types, and management systems. Results show that CH4 emissions from natural northern peatlands are highly variable with a 95% CI of 7.6-15.7 g C m(-2) year(-1) for the mean and 3.3-6.3 g C m(-2) year(-1) for the median. The overall annual average (mean +/- SD) is 12 +/- 21 g C m(-2) year(-1) with the highest emissions from fen ecosystems. Methane emissions from natural peatlands are mainly controlled by water table (WT) depth, plant community composition, and soil pH. Although mean annual air temperature is not a good predictor of CH4 emissions by itself, the interaction between temperature, plant community cover, WT depth, and soil pH is important. According to short-term forecasts of climate change, these complex interactions will be the main determinant of CH4 emissions from northern peatlands. Drainage significantly (p < .05) reduces CH4 emissions to the atmosphere, on average by 84%. Restoration of drained peatlands by rewetting or vegetation/rewetting increases CH4 emissions on average by 46% compared to the original premanagement CH4 fluxes. However, to fully evaluate the net effect of management practice on the greenhouse gas balance from high latitude peatlands, both net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and carbon exports need to be considered.

AB Methane fluxes were measured periodically in 1990 and 1991 in upland forest and peatland soils of a northern hardwood forest in the Adirondack region of New York State. A portion of the study area received lime (10 Mg CaCO3 ha-1) in October 1989 to mitigate several decades of chronic acid precipitation (H+ deposition in 1981 = 653 eq ha-1 yr-1). Consumption of atmospheric methane by forest soils averaged -0.60 mg CH4 m-2 d-1 and showed no difference between treatments (unlimed versus limed soils). Eliminating root growth and removing leaf litter from the soil seemed to decrease rates of methane consumption. Related responses of soil nitrogen transformations to the lime indicated lower nitrification rates and higher net nitrogen mineralization rates compared to unlimed soils, yet rates of methane consumption were unaffected by these changes in soil nitrogen transformations. Methane efflux from the peatland soils into the atmosphere averaged 12.1 mg CH4 m-2 d-1, with no significant difference in rates between treatments. Laboratory measurements revealed that liming resulted in less consumption of atmospheric methane (measured with atmospheres amended with methane) and potentially more methane production. Overall, methane efflux from these peatland soils is much lower than that for more northern counterparts that currently experience cooler climate but less acid precipitation. This suggests that several decades of acid precipitation may play a role in limiting methane emissions from northern peatlands.

AB Airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquired over Alaska are used to investigate the ability of SAR to distinguish between land cover classes of differing methane exchange rates. Land cover within the study area is divided into four classes: forest, bog, water, and fen, with fen having the highest methane emission. Accurate classification is achieved using both statistical and neural network techniques applied to fully polarimetric L- and C-band data. Similar classification accuracies are also obtained using non-polarimetric subsets of the data, analogous to data that would be available by combining SAR observations from ERS-1/2, JERS-1 (Fuyo-l), and RADARSAT. Accurate classification of fens, however, is possible only when the non-polarimetric subset includes L-band data.

AB Laboratory columns wider continuous flow were packed with peat from the catotelm of an ombrotrophic    bog to simulate the natural environment. Methane concentration increased from 1.4 to 47.8 mumol ml-1 due to anaerobic microbial degradation of the peat, while at the same time the water flow rate decreased from log -1.39 to -3.03 cm3 s-1 and the moisture content decreased from 85.7 to 56.6%. A control column sterilized by irradiation produced carbon dioxide, but, as the flow of water washed this soluble gas out of the column, the hydraulic conductivity and moisture content increased These two results suggest that it is the volume of the gas (in the gas phase within the bog) that controls the hydraulic conductivity of peat bogs. Volume accounting at the end of the experiment showed no gas in rhe sterilized column but 17% gas by volume in the microbially active column. We suggest that as gas bubbles occlude the interstitial pores of the peat the water flow is impeded, reducing both the hydraulic conductivity and the water saturation. The difficulty experienced in draining peat bogs is due to this occlusion, which is also responsible for the heightened water table found in raised bogs. Although methane is produced in bogs, only very low levels of methane emission have been reported Thus the methane released from northern areas will only significantly contribute to increasing radiative gases in the atmosphere if the bogs themselves are disturbed, for example by mining, when the entrapped methane is released, the water table falls, and the bog dries out.

AB Drainage of peatlands for forestry starts a succession of ground vegetation in which mire species are gradually replaced by forest species. Some mire plant communities vanish quickly following the water-level drawdown; some may prevail longer in the moister patches of peatland. Drainage ditches, as a new kind of surface, introduce another component of spatial variation in drained peatlands. These variations were hypothesized to affect methane (CH(4)) fluxes from drained peatlands. Methane fluxes from different plant communities and unvegetated surfaces, including ditches, were measured at the drained part of Lakkasuo mire, Central Finland. The fluxes were found to be related to peatland site type, plant community, water-table position and soil temperature. At nutrient-rich fen sites fluxes between plant communities differed only a little: almost all plots acted as CH(4) sinks (-0.9 to -0.4 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1)), with the exception of Eriophorum angustifolium Honck. communities, which emitted 0.9 g CH(4) m(-2) stop d(-1). At nutrient-poor bog site the differences between plant communities were clearer. The highest emissions were measured from Eriophorum vaginatum L. communities (29.7 mg CH(4) m(-2) stop d(-1)), with a decreasing trend to Sphagna (10.0 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1)supercript stop) and forest moss communities (2.6 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1)). CH(4) emissions from different kinds of ditches were highly variable, and extremely high emissions (summertime averages 182-600 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1) stop) were measured from continuously water-covered ditches at the drained fen. Variability in the emissions was caused by differences in the origin and movement of water in the ditches, as well as differences in vegetation communities in the ditches. While drainage on average greatly decreases CH(4) emissions from peatlands, a great spatial variability in fluxes is emerged. Emissions from ditches constantly covered with water, may in some cases have a great impact on the overall CH(4) emissions from drained peatlands.

AB Wetlands, including peatlands, are the main source of natural methane emission. Well-defined fen microsites have different methane emissions rates, but it is not known whether the methane-producing Archaea communities vary at these sites. Possible horizontal variations of communities, in a natural oligotrophic fen, were analysed by characterizing the methanogens from two well-defined microsites: Eriophorum lawn and Hummock. Community structures were studied at two different layers of the fen, showing, respectively, high and low methane production. The structure of methanogen populations was determined using molecular techniques targeting the 16SrRNA gene and combined denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Results subjected to non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS), diversity indices calculation and phylogenetic analysis revealed that upper layer communities changed with site while deeper layer communities remained the same. Phylogenetic analyses revealed six different clusters of sequences grouping with only two known orders of methanogens. Upper layers of Hummock were dominated by sequences clustering with members of Methanomicrobiales and sequences dominating the upper part of the Eriophorum lawn were related to members of the order Methanosarcinales. Novel methanogenic sequences were found at both sites at both depths. Vegetation characterizing the microsites probably influences the microbial communities in the layers of the fen where methane is produced.

AB Drainage and conversion of natural peatlands to forestry increases soil CO2 emissions through decomposition of peat and modifies the quantity and quality of litter inputs and therefore the soil carbon balance. In organic soils, CO2 net emissions and removals are reported using carbon emission factors (EF). The choice of specific default Tier 1 EF values from the IPCC 2013 Wetlands supplement depends on land-use categories and climate zones. However, Tier 1 EF for afforested peatlands in the temperate maritime climate zone are based on data from eight sites, mainly located in the hemiboreal zone, and the uncertainty associated with these default values is a concern. In addition, moving from Tier 1 to higher-Tier carbon reporting values is highly desirable when large areas are affected by land-use changes. In this study, we estimated site-specific soil carbon balance for the development of Tier 2 soil CO2-C EFs for afforested peatlands. Soil heterotrophic respiration and aboveground tree litterfall were measured during two years at eight afforested peatland sites in Ireland. In addition, fine-root turnover rate and site-specific fine-root biomass were used to quantify belowground litter inputs. We found that drainage of peatlands and planting them with either Sitka spruce or lodgepole pine, resulted in soils being net carbon sources. The soil carbon balance at multi-year sites varied between 63 +/- 92 and 309 +/- 67 g C m(-2) year(-1). Mean CO2-C EF for afforested peatlands was 1.68 +/- 0.33 t CO2-C ha(-1) year(-1). The improved CO2-C EFs presented here for afforested peatlands are proposed as a basis to update national CO2-C emissions from this land-use class in Ireland. Furthermore, new data from these sites will significantly contribute to the development of more reliable IPCC default Tier 1 CO2-C EFs for afforested peatlands in the maritime temperate climate zone.

TI METHANE AND CO2 EXCHANGE OVER PEATLAND AND THE EFFECTS OF AFFORESTATION

DT Article
AB The exchange of CH4 and CO2 over extensive tracts of peatland has recently been measured using micrometeorological methods. Fluxes of CH4 measured in Caithness (UK) during May and June 1994 using eddy covariance yielded fluxes in the range -70 to +170 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1) with a mean flux of 39 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1).
   Landscape emissions of CH4 from peatland are shown to vary with water table and temperature, increasing from 25 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1) at 5 per cent area to 50 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1) with 30 per cent within the footprint occupied by pool. A positive temperature response of 4.9 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1) degrees C-1 in the temperature range 6-12 degrees C was also observed.
   The mean day time fluxes of CO2 during May and June 1994, of -3.6 mmol m(-2) h(-1) were two orders of magnitude larger than the emission of CH4 of 40 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), while at night (when net radiation is negative) the respiration flux of CO2 averaged +2.2 mmol m(-2) h(-1) approximately two orders of magnitude larger than night-rime CH4 emissions of 30 mu mol m(-2) h(-1).

AB Vegetation and hydrology are important controlling factors in peatland methane dynamics. This study aimed at investigating the role of vegetation components, sedges, dwarf shrubs, and Sphagnum mosses, in methane fluxes of a boreal fen under natural and experimental water level draw-down conditions. We measured the fluxes during growing seasons 2001-2004 using the static chamber technique in a field experiment where the role of the ecosystem components was assessed via plant removal treatments. The first year was a calibration year after which the water level draw-down and vegetation removal treatments were applied. Under natural water level conditions, plant-mediated fluxes comprised 68%-78% of the mean growing season flux (1:73 +/- 0:17 gCH(4) m(-2) month 1 from June to September), of which Sphagnum mosses and sedges accounted for one-fourth and three-fourths, respectively. The presence of dwarf shrubs, on the other hand, had a slightly attenuating effect on the fluxes. In water level drawdown conditions, the mean flux was close to zero (0:03 +/- 0:03 gCH(4) m(-2) month(-1)) and the presence and absence of the plant groups had a negligible effect. In conclusion, water level acted as a switch; only in natural water level conditions did vegetation regulate the net fluxes. The results are relevant for assessing the response of fen peatland fluxes to changing climatic conditions, as water level drawdown and the consequent vegetation succession are the major projected impacts of climate change on northern peatlands.

AB Natural wetlands such as mires contribute up to 33% to the global emission of methane. The emission of methane is driven by trophic interactions of anaerobes that collectively degrade biopolymers. The hypothesis of this study was that these interactions in contrasting methane-emitting mire soils are functionally similar but linked to dissimilar taxa. This hypothesis was addressed by evaluating anaerobic processes and microbial taxa of eutrophic, mesotrophic and oligotrophic mire soils. Glucose was fermented to various products (e.g. H-2, CO2, butyrate, acetate). Acetoclastic methanogenesis occurred, and acetogenesis and methanogenesis transformed H-2-CO2 to acetate and methane, respectively. Although product profiles, cultivable cell numbers and gene copy numbers [mcrA (encodes alpha-subunit of methyl-CoM reductase) and 16S rRNA genes] were similar for all mire soils, only approximately 15% of detected family-level bacteria and species-level methanogens were shared by all mire soils. Approximately, 40% of the detected family-level taxa of each mire soil have no cultured isolates. Acidic conditions appeared to restrict the number of dominant phylotypes. The results indicated (a) that microbial processes which drive methanogenesis are similar but facilitated by dissimilar microbial communities in contrasting mire soils and (b) that mire soils harbor a large number of taxa with no cultured isolates.

AB Intact peat bogs are carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks and methane (CH4) sources. Facing drought and drainage, they may turn into CO2 sources and decreased CH4 sources. Information on the CO2 and CH4 exchange of alpine peat bogs in Central Europe has been missing so far. Here, we present data from two years of CO2 and CH4 exchange between an alpine low-shrub pine bog in the Eastern Alps and the atmosphere using the eddy covariance method. The annual net CO2 ecosystem exchange of the peatland differs substantially between the two measurement years, with -24 +/- 13 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the drought affected first year and -84 +/- 13 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the more humid second year. We found ecosystem respiration (R-eco) to depend on variations in soil temperature and soil moisture, and gross primary production (GPP) to be strongly linked to net radiation and daylength. The summer drought in 2015 shifted the peatland from a C sink to a C source, as increases in R-eco clearly exceeded enhanced GPP. Annual CH4 emission was 4.40 +/- 2.40 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during the drought-affected year and 5.24 +/- 2.57 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during the wetter year. Summer CH4 fluxes contribute 44% to the annual balance, followed by autumn (27%), spring (20%) and winter season fluxes (9%). CH4 fluxes most strongly depend on soil temperatures, soil moisture effects increase at smaller time-scales. Annual CH4 emissions are low compared to other temperate bogs, which most likely is the result of the ongoing degradation, indicated by a shift in vegetation composition. Net flux of both greenhouse gases was positive in the first year (+75 g CO2-eq m(-2)) and negative in the second year (-110 g CO2-eq m(-2)). Our results indicate that drought events and seasonal and interannual variations in temperature and precipitation strongly affect the C cycle of alpine peat bogs.

AB A boreal bog located in the James Bay lowlands, Canada, was instrumented with an open-path gas analyzer to monitor the turbulent fluxes of methane throughout the summer of 2012. The mostly continuous eddy covariance measurements permitted the study of methane dynamics at the hourly, daily and seasonal scales. To exclude data segments for which the biological methane fluxes were underestimated due to inefficient atmospheric transport under stable stratification, we applied a novel approach based on both the atmospheric stability parameter zeta = z/L and the friction velocity u*, where z is the measurement height and L the Obukhov length. The field measurements revealed the existence of at least one sustained ebullition event, triggered by low barometric pressures, a declining water table and increasing mechanical turbulence - suggesting that large-scale release of methane bubbles can be an important transport mechanism of methane in boreal bogs. The validity of similarity scaling for atmospheric methane under convective conditions was also assessed and the normalized standard deviations of methane concentrations did not scale well with C, highlighting the heterogeneity in natural methane production and release across the bog. Overall the hourly emissions ranged between -2.0 and 32.1 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), with a summertime mean of 2A mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). At the daily scale, the two main controls on methane emissions were found to be the water table position and the peat temperature at 03 m under the surface. Contrary to other studies, seasonal methane emissions peaked when the water table was at its maximum distance from the surface, around mid-August. No clear diurnal pattern could be found in methane emissions, indicating that methane was produced quite deep within the peat. The seasonal emissions were estimated at 4.4 g CH4 m(-2), and compared well with other observations over similar landscapes using different measurement techniques. Given that methane releases and transport are greatly affected by local characteristics such as climate and vegetative cover, this study emphasizes the need for further in situ continuous measurements of methane fluxes across northern peatlands.

AB Methane-oxidizing bacteria that inhabit peat play a significant role in carbon recycling. They reduce methane emissions to the atmosphere and supply carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. Our investigations aimed at determining the peat profile's (0-80 cm) ability to oxidize methane focused on the low peat Garbatowka Peatland in southwestern Poland. The experiments were carried out for four 20 cm layers. Samples of peat material of natural moisture were incubated in atmosphere enriched in 5% [v/v] CH4 at 5, 10, and 20 degrees C. It was observed that methane oxidation (up to 145 mg CH4 kg d.w.(-1) d(-1)) was most efficient at 20 degrees C. The highest methanotrophic activity at each tested temperature was observed for a different zone of the peat profile. At 5 degrees C the most active layer was 0-20 cm, at 10 degrees C 40-60 cm, while at 20 degrees C the deepest layer (60-80 cm) showed the highest methanotrophic activity.

AB There is a limited understanding of the hydrological and microclimatic processes from drained, harvested, or restored peatlands, and by extension the nature of the carbon balance is uncertain. However, understanding the symbiotic processes governing water and gas exchange is essential to the development of appropriate management plans for peatland restoration. In this paper, we highlight and contrast the suite of processes governing the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon on natural, harvested, and restored peatlands. Evapotranspiration from harvested sites is important throughout the spring and summer, and is not greatly different from the adjacent natural bog. On cutover peatlands, strong capillary water movement compensates for the lack of vascular plants, which on the natural bog become increasingly important as the capillary water movement within drying Sphagnum decreases. Methane emissions from cutover bogs are an order of magnitude lower than in natural sites, however, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are approximately three times greater. Peatland restoration enhances CO2 sequestration, although restoration (at least in the short term) does not restore the net carbon sink function to that in natural bogs. A conceptual model highlighting these changes in the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon from a natural bog through drainage, harvesting, abandonment, and restoration is presented.

AB Drying and rewetting to a variable extent influence the C gas exchange between peat soils and the atmosphere. We incubated a decomposed and compacted fen peat and investigated in two experiments 1) the vertical distribution of CO2 and CH4 production rates and their response to drying and 2) the effects of temperature, drying intensity and duration on CO2 production rates and on CH4 production recovery after rewetting. Surface peat down to 5 cm contributed up to 67% (CO2) and above 80% (CH4) of the depth-aggregated (50 cm) production. As CO2 production sharply decreased with depth water table fluctuations in deeper peat layers are thus not expected to cause a substantial increase in soil respiration in this site. Compared to anaerobic water saturated conditions drying increased peat CO2 production by a factor between 1.4 and 2.1. Regarding the effects of the studied factors, warmer conditions increased and prolonged drying duration decreased CO2 production whereas the soil moisture level had little influence. No significant interactions among factors were found. Short dry events under warmer conditions are likely to result in greatest peaks of CO2 production rates. Upon rewetting, CH4 production was monitored over time and the recovery was standardized to pre-drying levels to compare the treatment effects. Methane production increased non-linearly over time and all factors (temperature, drying intensity and duration) influenced the pattern of post-drying CH4 production. Peat undergoing more intense and longer drying events required a longer lag time before substantial CH4 production occurred and warmer conditions appeared to speed up the process.

AB Under the warmer climate, predicted for the future, northern peatlands are expected to become drier. This drying will lower the water table and likely result in reduced emissions of methane (CH4) from these ecosystems. However, the prediction of declining CH4 fluxes does not consider the potential effects of ecological succession, particularly the invasion of sedges into currently wet sites (open water pools, low lawns). The goal of this study was to characterize the relationship between the presence of sedges in peatlands and CH4 efflux under natural conditions and under a climate change simulation (drained peatland). Methane fluxes, gross ecosystem production, and dissolved pore water CH4 concentrations were measured and a vegetation survey was conducted in a natural and drained peatland near St. Charles-de-Bellechasse, Quebec, Canada, in the summer of 2003. Each peatland also had plots where the sedges had been removed by clipping. Sedges were larger, more dominant, and more productive at the drained peatland site. The natural peatland had higher CH4 fluxes than the drained peatland, indicating that drainage was a significant control on CH4 flux. Methane flux was higher from plots with sedges than from plots where sedges had been removed at the natural peatland site, whereas the opposite case was observed at the drained peatland site. These results suggest that CH4 flux was enhanced by sedges at the natural peatland site and attenuated by sedges at the drained peatland site. However, the attenuation of CH4 flux due to sedges at the drained site was reduced in wetter periods. This finding suggests that CH4 flux could be decreased in the event of climate warming due to the greater depth to the water table, and that sedges colonizing these areas could further attenuate CH4 fluxes during dry periods. However, during wet periods, the sedges may cause CH4 fluxes to be higher than is currently predicted for climate change scenarios.

AB The biogeochemical processes of methane production and oxidation were studied in the upper horizons of tundra and taiga soils and raised bogs and lake bottom sediments near the Tarko-Sale gas field in western Siberia. Both in dry and water-logged soils, the total methane concentration (in soil particles and gaseous phase) was an order of magnitude higher than in the soil gaseous phase alone (22 and 1.1 nl/cm(3), respectively). In bogs and lake bottom sediments methane concentration was as high as 11 mul/cm(3). Acetate was the major precursor of the newly formed methane. The rate of aceticlastic methanogenesis reached 55 ng C/(cm(3) day), whereas that of autotrophic methanogenesis was an order of magnitude lower. The most active methane production and oxidation were observed in bogs and lake sediments, where the delta C-13 values of CO2 were inversely related to the intensity of bacterial methane oxidation. Methane diffusing from bogs and lake bottom sediments showed delta C-13 values ranging from -78 to -47 parts per thousand, whereas the delta C-13 value of carbon dioxide ranged from -18 to - 1 parts per thousand. In these ecosystems, methane emission comprised from 3 to 206 mg CH4/(m(2) day). Conversely, the dry and waterlogged soils of the tundra and taiga took up atmospheric methane at a rate: varying from 0.3 to 5.3 mg CH4/(m(2) day). Methane consumption in soils was of biological nature. This was confirmed by the radioisotopic method and chamber experiments, in which weighting of methane carbon was observed (the delta C-13 value changed from -51 to -41 parts per thousand).

AB Forestry practises such has drainage have been shown to decrease emissions of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) from peatlands. The aim of the study was to examine the methanogen populations in a drained bog in northern Finland, and to assess the possible effect of ash fertilization on potential methane production and methanogen communities. Peat samples were collected from control and ash fertilized (15,000 kg/ha) plots 5 years after ash application, and potential CH4 production was measured. The methanogen community structure was studied by DNA isolation, PCR amplification of the methyl coenzyme-M reductase (mcr) gene, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The drained peatland showed low potential methane production and methanogen diversity in both control and ash-fertilized plots. Samples from both upper and deeper layers of peat were dominated by three groups of sequences related to Rice cluster-I hydrogenotroph methanogens. Even though pH was marginally greater in the ash-treated site, the occurrence of those sequences was not affected by ash fertilization. Interestingly, a less common group of sequences, related to the Fen cluster, were found only in the fertilized plots. The study confirmed the depth related change of methanogen populations in peatland.

AB Methane emissions from peal wetlands have been shown to be very sensitive to soil temperature and the position of the water table in controlled environment studies and in the field. However, these studies have been made using small chambers which average fluxes over areas ranging from 0.05 to 0.3 m(2) and spatial variability in methane emission from these ecosystems commonly spans several orders of magnitude over linear scales of a few metres. In this study, fluxes of methane from peat wetlands in Caithness, Scotland were measured over a 14 d period in May and June 1994 using eddy covariance methods, which provided 30 min mean methane fluxes averaged over areas of typically 10(4) to 10(5) m(2), overcoming the small-scale spatial variability in emission. The mean methane emissions varied with wind direction over the areas of bog with different water tables. Within each sector of the fetch, the mean methane emission increased with temperature in the range 7-11 degrees C by approximately a factor of two (5 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) degrees C-1), close to the response obtained in controlled conditions. The rates of methane emission From the bog averaged 39 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) with peak values approaching 170 mu mol m(-2) h(-1). The responses of the methane emission to temperature and water table at this site have been used to calculate the seasonal variability in emission rates and annual emissions From continuous measurements of water table and meteorological variables over the Caithness peatlands. Annual emission from these peatlands was estimated to be 0.43 mol m(-2) yr(-1), and From U.K. peatlands a range of 40-141 kT yr(-1) was predicted. The responses were used to simulate the effects of increasing mean temperature by up to 4 degrees C and varying the water table by up to +/- 2 cm. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Drainage of peatlands for forestry often leads to carbon dioxide (CO2) net emission from soil due to loss of peat. This emission can be compensated for by the increased tree growth. Hovewer, many drained peatlands have low tree growth due to nutrient limitations. Tree growth at these peatlands can be effectively increased by fertilization, but fertilization has been also found to increase decomposition rates.
   We studied the long-term effect of fertilization of low-productive forestry-drained peatlands on the complete ecosystem greenhouse gas exchange, including both soil and tree component, and accounting for CO2, methane and nitrous oxide. Five N-rich study sites (flark fens and a rich fen) and one N-poor ombrotrophic site were established. Fertilization had started at the study sites 16-67 years before our measurements.
   Fertilization considerably increased tree stand CO2 sink ( + 248-1013 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1)). Decomposition increased on average by 45% ( + 431 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1)) and litter production by 38% ( + 360 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1)). Thus, on average 84% of the increased decomposition could be attributed to increased litter production and 16% to increased soil CO 2 net emission due to increased loss of peat. Soil CO2 net emission correlated positively with water table depth and top soil N concentration.
   Fertilization increased soil CO2 net emission at the drained flark fens on average by 187 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1). At the rich fen, net emission decreased. The N-poor bog exhibited soil CO2 sink both with and without fertilization. Effects on methane and nitrous oxide emissions were small at most sites.
   The increase in tree stand CO2 sink was higher than the increase in soil CO2 net emission, indicating that fertilization has a climate cooling effect in the decadal time scale. Yet, as the fertilized plots at N-rich sites exhibited soil CO2 source or zero balance, continuation of fertilization-based forestry over several rotations would lead to progressive loss of ecosystem C. At the N-poor bog, fertilization-based forestry may have a climate-cooling effect also in the centennial time scale.

AB Measurement data on methane fluxes in the palsa mire ecosystem at the border of tundra and taiga zones in northeastern European Russia are presented. It was found for the first time that an intense methane flux from the surface of the permafrost mound (palsa) is determined by the spring thawing of the seasonally thawed horizon in the layer of 14-25 cm. During this period, the emission was 4-20 times higher than the summer values. In lichen communities of peat mounds, the CH4 sink prevailed during the summer-autumn period. The total methane flux in different parts of the mire in June-September varied from 0.18 to 16.5 kg CH4/ha. In general, the palsa mire emitted 81 kg CH4/ha per year to the atmosphere. The methane emission from the surface of peat mounds and hollows made up 20% and 80% of the annual flux, respectively.

AB Methane emission from peatlands contributes substantially to global warming but is significantly reduced by sulfate reduction, which is fuelled by globally increasing aerial sulfur pollution. However, the biology behind sulfate reduction in terrestrial ecosystems is not well understood and the key players for this process as well as their abundance remained unidentified. Comparative 16S rRNA gene stable isotope probing (SIP) in the presence and absence of sulfate indicated that a Desulfosporosinus species, which constitutes only 0.006% of the total microbial community 16S rRNA genes, is an important sulfate reducer in a long-term experimental peatland field site. Parallel SIP using dsrAB (encoding subunit A and B of the dissimilatory (bi) sulfite reductase) identified no additional sulfate reducers under the conditions tested. For the identified Desulfosporosinus species a high cell-specific sulfate reduction rate of up to 341 fmol SO42- cell(-1) day(-1) was estimated. Thus, the small Desulfosporosinus population has the potential to reduce sulfate in situ at a rate of 4.0-36.8 nmol (g soil w. wt.)(-1) day(-1), sufficient to account for a considerable part of sulfate reduction in the peat soil. Modeling of sulfate diffusion to such highly active cells identified no limitation in sulfate supply even at bulk concentrations as low as 10 mu M. Collectively, these data show that the identified Desulfosporosinus species, despite being a member of the 'rare biosphere', contributes to an important biogeochemical process that diverts the carbon flow in peatlands from methane to CO2 and, thus, alters their contribution to global warming.

AB The effect of shallow water table fluctuations on the evaporation and CO2 fluxes in a peatland is investigated. The fluxes of evaporation and net ecosystem exchange of carbon were measured from mid-spring to the end of summer in 2005 and 2006 and simulated independently with process models. The observed and modelled data were then compared along a gradient of water levels. Any variation along the gradient would imply an influence of the water table on the flux. It became evident that changes in the water table had no effect on the evaporation and CO2 fluxes of the peatland. A probable cause could be the high water content of the soil, even for the low water tables, and the stable thermal conductivity of the soil. This study has implications for current land use management, which is aimed at reducing CO2-emissions. Regulations are currently concerned with water table while this study shows that soil water content should be focused on as well. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As natural sources of methane (CH4), peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Climate models predict that evapotranspiration will increase under a 2 x CO2 scenario due to increased temperatures leading to lowered water tables at many northern latitudes. Given that the position of the water table within a peatland can have a large effect on CH4 emissions, climate change may alter the CH4 emissions from peatlands in this area. Research was conducted during 2001-2003 on natural and drained (8 years prior) sites within a poor fen in central Quebec. Flux measurements were made for each site at different microtopographical features that varied in depth to water table and vegetation cover. The quantity of CH4 dissolved in the pore water was measured in the field and the potential of the peat for CH4 production and consumption was determined in the laboratory. Methane emissions and storage were lower in the drained fen. Growing season CH4 emissions at the drained site were 55% lower than the control site, primarily due to significantly reduced fluxes from topographic highs (up to 97% reduction), while the flux from topographically low areas remained high. The maintenance of high fluxes at these hollow sites was related to hydrological and ecological effects of the water table drawdown. The removal of standing water removed a potential zone of CH4 oxidation. It also enabled plant colonization at these locations, leading to an increase in gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP). At the hollow sites, seasonal CH4 emissions were significantly correlated to seasonal GEP (R-2 = 0.85). These results suggest that the response of northern peatland CH4 dynamics to climate change depends on the antecedent moisture conditions of the site. Moreover, ecological succession can play an important role for determining future CH4 emissions, particularly from wetter sites.

AB Northern peatlands accumulate atmospheric CO2 thus counteracting climate warming. However, CH4 which is more efficient as a greenhouse gas than CO2, is produced in the anaerobic decomposition processes in pear. When peatlands are taken for forestry their water table is lowered by ditching. We studied long-term effects of lowered water table on the development of vegetation and the annual emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O in an ombrotrophic bog and in a minerotrophic fen in Finland. Reclamation of the pear sites for forestry had changed the composition and coverage of the field and ground layer species, and increased highly the growth of tree stand at the drained fen. In general, drainage increased the annual CO2 emissions but the emissions were also affected by the natural fluctuations of water table. In contrast to CO2, drainage had decreased the emissions of CH4, the drained fen even consumed atmospheric CH4. CO2 and CH4 emissions were higher in the virgin fen than in the virgin bog. There were no N2O emissions from neither type of virgin sites. Drainage had, however, highly increased the N2O emissions from the fen. The results suggest that post-drainage changes in gas fluxes depend on the trophy of the original mires.

AB High latitude wetlands are significant sources of atmospheric methane, with emission rates that are susceptible to effects of climate change. Our data demonstrate that unlike mid-latitude wetlands, methane in northern peatlands is not derived from acetate or C-1 compounds. These latter compounds accumulate to high levels with acetate as the primary organic end product of anaerobic decomposition. Acetate is ultimately degraded aerobically to carbon dioxide after diffusion into oxic regions of peat. Therefore, organic precursors destined for methane in mid-latitude wetlands are degraded to carbon dioxide in northern wetlands. A warming-induced initiation of acetoclastic methanogenesis could substantially increase methane production.

AB A brief review of published observations of methane fluxes to the atmosphere from bogs and lakes in the permafrost zone is presented. Approaches to modeling the emission of methane from bogs are considered, and their advantages and shortcomings, in particular, from the point of view of their coupling to climate models, are outlined. A one-dimensional model developed by the authors for methane generation, transport, and sink in the ground-water body system and coupled to a hydrothermodynamic model of a water body is described. The approaches used in analogous models for bogs as well as new parametrizations describing lake-specific processes are applied. A parametrization of methane generation in vicinity the lower boundary of the thawed ground zone underneath a water body (talik) is suggested. The results of calibrating this model against available observations of methane emission from the thermokarst Shuchi Lake in northeastern Siberia are discussed.

AB Emissions of CH4, CO2 and N2O from peat land soil have important implications for the atmospheric greenhouse gases balance. Till now, little is known about the patterns and controls of greenhouse gas from peatland soil where lied by permafrost in Northeast China. In the present study, soil GHG fluxes were observed over three years from a peatland in Great Hing'an Mountains. The results show that pronounced seasonal variation was observed in soil CH4 and CO2 fluxes during the measurement periods, but was not appeared in soil N2O fluxes. Seasonal dynamics of CO? emissions were strongly regulated by air temperature and soil temperature at 5 cm. On seasonal scale, the Q(10) of soil CO2 in spring was much higher than other seasons, which implied more CO2 emission to atmosphere under spring warming. We also found a negative relationship between soil CO2 fluxes and water table depth, with the emissions decreasing as water table approach to soil surface. The annual emissions of greenhouse gas from peatland soil were 641.13 g m(-2) yr(-1) for CO2, 0.65 g m(-2) yr(-1) for CH4 and 29.7 mg m(-2) yr(-1) for N2O, respectively. Our results suggest that peatland soil CO2 emission was more sensitive to climate change, especially warming.

AB Since the last deglaciation, 300-500 Pg carbon have accumulated in northern peatlands (346 mill. ha). While sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2), these peatlands release considerable amounts of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. The greenhouse-gas balance of peatlands may change in the future if summers become warmer and drier, as has been predicted for high latitudes. Subsequent emissions of CH4 would decrease, whereas emissions of CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O) would increase. Water-level drawdown has been predicted to enhance the greenhouse impact from northern peatlands. The components of carbon cycling were measured both in undrained and drained peatlands of different trophic levels, The results were drawn together into a single radiative forcing factor, to assess the combined atmospheric effects of water-level drawdown. We present a hypothesis, based on the measured changes in carbon stores in soil and tree stand, and fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O after water-level drawdown caused by drainage for forestry. The hypothesis suggests that possible drying arising from climate change would, in fact, decrease the impact of northern peatlands on the total radiative forcing for about one hundred years by c. 0.1 W m(-2). This is caused by the decrease in CH4 emissions, fairly small changes in the peat carbon storage, and increase in the tree-stand biomass storage.

AB Methane flux in a boreal wetland in central Saskatchewan, Canada was measured by a static chamber technique. The northern ribbed fen site was part of the Boreal Ecosystem and Atmospheric Study. The results indicated temperature, water level relative to the peat surface, vegetative type and P concentrations in interstitial water all had an influence on CH4 emission rates. Methane fluxes from peat at the site ranged from 176 to 2250 mmol CH4 m(-2) yr(-1), exceeding those commonly reported for other freshwater wetlands around the world. The CH4 flux rates increased from 1.08 at the edge of the fen to 13.80 mmol CH4 m-2 d(-1) near the center. Methane flux was directly correlated with water levels and temperature at all measurement locations except two in the central part of the fen where fluxes became lower. The lower correlation of water levels and temperature with CH4 flux in sites located at the fen center may be attributed to other more restricting variables created by the water flow through the center of the fen. Methane flux rates in sites with limited water flow were also positively correlated with P concentrations in interstitial water at 50 cm, the depth where CH4 is likely to be produced.

AB In the course of field and laboratory studies, the activities of nitrogen fixation, denitrification, CO2 emission, and methane formation in an oligotrophic peat soil were determined at the Staroselsky Mokh Station of the Central Forest State Natural Biospheric Reserve in Tver oblast. The high intensity of methane oxidation was found in the oligotrophic peat soil. It was supposed that methane under these conditions could be used by diazotrophic bacteria as energy source. Determination of the nitrogen-fixing activity of oligotrophic peat soil in the presence of methane showed a sharp increase in the nitrogenase activity. It is important to emphasize that nitrogenase activity was higher in the presence of methane, even in comparison with the variant with glucose. The preferential absorption of nitrous oxide by the upper horizon of oligotrophic peat soils was found, which allowed us to consider these ecosystems to be a natural sink for N2O.

AB Eddy covariance measurements of methane were carried out over the fen "Murnauer Moos" in the south of Germany in order to evaluate the performance of a newly developed eddy covariance measurement system, based on a frequency-modulated tunable diode laser spectrometer as a fast chemical sensor. During a six-day period, an average daytime methane emission of (5.4 +/- 1.8) mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) was measured. We find this value moderate, considering the favorable meteorological and soil conditions for methane emission. Diurnal cycles of the fluxes of methane and carbon dioxide as well as of sensible and latent heat are presented. Results are discussed in terms of relevant micrometeorological quantities, and quality control procedures based on Allan variance and spectral analysis are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Bogs and fens from northern Minnesota produce large quantities of CH4, which may be either emitted to the atmosphere or stored in below-ground reservoirs. The identity of the organic materials that support CH4 production has been uncertain, but we present evidence that a significant fraction of surface emission and below-ground CH4 is derived from recently fixed organic compounds. First, the CH4 emitted from both bogs and fens has a C-14 signature equivalent to contemporary values for atmospheric CO2. Second, in flooded fens rates of CH4 emission are linearly related to rates of CO2 exchange and to the delta(13)C of emitted CH4. Third, peat-porewaters as deep as several meters below the surface contain mixtures of CH4 derived from both modern and older organic substrates. The source of the modern organic substrates is most likely dissolved organic compounds produced from the decay of recently produced litter, roots and root exudation products and transported into deeper layers of the peat. These data indicate that CH4 emissions are closely linked to the living vegetation and hydrology of northern peatlands and less dependent on the lability and decomposition of peat within the deeper layers of the catotelm.

AB Drained coastal peatlands are a source of greenhouse gas (GHG) through abundant CO2 release caused by aerobic peat degradation. Published rates of CO2, fixation and CH4, release for natural peatlands suggest that areas of peat formation are a (small) net source of GHG emission because the radiative effect of emitted CH4 exceeds the CO2 uptake by the vegetation. It is shown here that wetland restoration of reclaimed peat areas in the western Netherlands leads to a reduction of GHG emission because the expected increase in anaerobically generated CH4 release is much smaller than the decrease in aerobically produced CO2.

AB Gas bubbles are an important pathway for methane release from peatlands. The mechanisms controlling gas bubble transport and emissions in peat remain uncertain. The effects of hydrostatic pressure and peat structure on the dynamics of gas bubbles in shallow peat were therefore tested in laboratory experiments. A peat monolith was retrieved from a raised bog and maintained in a saturated state. Three distinct layers were identified from noninvasive permittivity measurements supported by soil physical properties (porosity, bulk density). Phase I of the experiment involved monitoring for the accumulation of gas bubbles under steady pressure and temperature conditions. The data showed evidence for gas bubbles being impeded by a shallow semiconfining layer at depths between 10 and 15 cm. Visible gas bubbles observed on the side of the sample box were recorded over time to estimate changes in the vertical distribution of volumetric gas content. Porosity estimates derived using the Complex Refraction Index Model (CRIM) suggest that gas bubbles enlarge the pore space when the exerted pressure is high enough. Phase II involved triggering release of trapped bubbles by repeatedly increasing and decreasing hydrostatic pressure in an oversaturated condition. Comparison of changes in pressure head and methane density in the head space confirmed that the increasing buoyancy force during drops in pressure is more important for triggering ebullition than increasing mobility during increases in pressure. Our findings demonstrate the importance of changes in hydrostatic pressure on bubble size and variations in resistance of the peat fabric in regulating methane releases from peatlands.

AB Anthropogenic greenhouse gases are expected to induce changes in global climate that can alter ecosystems in ways that, in turn, may further affect climate. Such climate-ecosystem interactions can generate either positive or negative feedbacks to the climate system, thereby either enhancing or diminishing the magnitude of global climate change. Important terrestrial feedback mechanisms include CO2 fertilization (negative feedbacks), carbon storage in vegetation and soils (positive and negative feedbacks), vegetation albedo (positive feedbacks), and peatland methane emissions (positive and negative feedbacks). While the processes involved are complex, not readily quantifiable, and demonstrate both positive and negative feedback potential, we conclude that the combined effect of the feedback mechanisms reviewed here will likely amplify climate change relative to current projections that have not yet adequately incorporated these mechanisms.

AB Ebullition and episodic ebullition in particular, may be an important pathway for methane (CH4) losses from northern peatlands. We quantified the importance of episodic ebullition using controlled environment laboratory incubations of samples of near-surface bog peat, focusing on how ebullition can be measured effectively and assessing the variation in CH4 losses between microhabitats and seasons. The peat samples were collected from hollow and lawn microhabitats at two raised bogs: Longbridgemuir, southwest Scotland, and Cors Fochno, west Wales. We found that CH4 fluxes excluding episodic ebullition differed between peatland microhabitats but not between summer and early autumn conditions. Conversely, episodic ebullition did not differ between microhabitat types but virtually stopped after the onset of early autumn conditions. Most strikingly, episodic ebullition was less than 3.3% of total CH4 fluxes, and was therefore an insignificant mechanism of CH4 loss from our peat samples.

AB Methane emissions from the peat bogs in Connemara, Ireland have been inferred from the trace gas observations at the Mace Head Atmospheric Research Station using the nocturnal box method. A total of 237 local events, during April to September, over a 12-year period have been studied. Simultaneous emissions of methane, carbon dioxide and chloroform are routinely observed under nocturnal inversions with low wind speeds from the peat bogs proximal to Mace Head. Night-time deposition of ozone and hydrogen occurs concurrently with these emissions. Using the temporally correlated methane and ozone data we estimate methane emissions from each event. Simultaneous methane and chloroform emissions, together with ozone and hydrogen deposition have been characterised, leading to the estimation of methane emission rates for each event. The mean methane emission flux was found to be 400 +/- 90 ng m(-2) s(-1). A strong seasonal cycle was found in the methane emission fluxes but there was little evidence of a long-term trend in the emissions from the peat bogs in the vicinity of the Mace Head station.

AB Controls on methane emission from peatlands in northern Minnesota were investigated by correlation to environmental variables and by field manipulation. From September 1988 through September 1990, methane flux measurements were made at weekly to monthly intervals at six sites in the Marcell Experimental Forest, northern Minnesota (two open bog sites, two forested bog sites, a poor fen, and a fen lagg). Flux was related to water table position and peat temperature with simple correlations at individual sites and multiple regression on all sites together. The effect of water table was also investigated experimentally in ''bog corrals'' (open-ended metal enclosures set in the peat) in which water table was artificially raised to the surface in the driest peatland. Temperature largely controlled variation in flux within individual ecosystems at Marcell, but hydrology distinguished between-site variation. Water table position, peat temperature, and degree of peat humification explained 91% of the variance in log CH4 flux, predicted annual methane emission from individual wetlands successfully, and predicted the change in flux due to the water table manipulation. Raising the water table in the bog corrals by an average of 6 cm in autumn 1989 and 10 cm in summer 1990 increased emission by 2.5x and 2.2x, respectively. Just as expanding the scale of investigation from a single habitat in a wetland to several wetlands necessitates incorporation of additional variables to explain flux (water table, peat characteristics), modeling flux from several wetland regions, if possible, will require the addition of climate parameters.

AB 1 Methane emissions from emergent plants in two peatlands were measured in plant enclosure experiments. During the summer growing season, methane emissions on a plant dry mass basis from Scheuchzeria palustris (130 +/- 14 mu mol g(-1) day(-1)) were higher than from other peatland plants, such as Chamaedaphne calyculata (20 +/- 3 mu mol g(-1) day(-1)) and Carex oligosperma (91 +/- 38 mu mol g(-1) day(-1)), but were lower than from Calla palustris (280 +/- 37 mu mol g(-1) day(-1)).
   2 The contribution to net methane efflux from S. palustris, the dominant emergent plant in one peatland, was 15.6 +/- 2.2 mmol m(-2) day(-1), based on the plant enclosure experiments and areal biomass measurements. These results were not significantly different from the difference between measurements of methane efflux using chambers enclosing clipped and unclipped plots (12.0-27.9 mmol m(-2) day(-1)).
   3 We determined that methane transport through S. palustris contributed between 64 and 90% of the net methane efflux from the peatland, while the other peatland without plants capable of rapid methane transport had significantly lower methane efflux. The higher annual efflux from peat with aerenchymatous plants appears to be due to several factors, including increased substrate production which enhances methane production, reduction in methane oxidation, as well as easier methane transport from the site of production.
   4 Plants capable of transporting methane regulated the methane pool in the saturated zone by depleting both dissolved methane in the pore-waters and the concentration of methane in gas bubbles trapped in the saturated peat.
   5 Our experiments indicate that methane transport through S. palustris is due to molecular diffusion, and is not influenced by pressurization or stomatal aperture.

AB Drainage has turned peatlands from a carbon sink into one of the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG) sources from cultivated soils. We analyzed a unique data set (12 peatlands, 48 sites and 122 annual budgets) of mainly unpublished GHG emissions from grasslands on bog and fen peat as well as other soils rich in soil organic carbon (SOC) in Germany. Emissions and environmental variables were measured with identical methods. Site-averaged GHG budgets were surprisingly variable (29.2 +/- 17.4 t CO2-eq. ha(-1)yr(-1)) and partially higher than all published data and the IPCC default emission factors for GHG inventories. Generally, CO2 (27.7 +/- 17.3 t CO(2)ha(-1)yr(-1)) dominated the GHG budget. Nitrous oxide (2.3 +/- 2.4kg N2O-N ha(-1)yr(-1)) and methane emissions (30.8 +/- 69.8kg CH4-C ha(-1)yr(-1)) were lower than expected except for CH4 emissions from nutrient-poor acidic sites. At single peatlands, CO2 emissions clearly increased with deeper mean water table depth (WTD), but there was no general dependency of CO2 on WTD for the complete data set. Thus, regionalization of CO2 emissions by WTD only will remain uncertain. WTD dynamics explained some of the differences between peatlands as sites which became very dry during summer showed lower emissions. We introduced the aerated nitrogen stock (N-air) as a variable combining soil nitrogen stocks with WTD. CO2 increased with N-air across peatlands. Soils with comparatively low SOC concentrations showed as high CO2 emissions as true peat soils because N-air was similar. N2O emissions were controlled by the WTD dynamics and the nitrogen content of the topsoil. CH4 emissions can be well described by WTD and ponding duration during summer. Our results can help both to improve GHG emission reporting and to prioritize and plan emission reduction measures for peat and similar soils at different scales.

AB Peatlands cover approximately 65,600 km(2) (16 %) of the Swedish land area. The available areas suitable for peatland expansion are far from occupied after ca. 12,000 years of the present interglacial. We estimate the potential extent of peatland in Sweden, based on slope properties of possible areas excluding lakes and glaciofluvial deposits. We assume no human presence or anthropic effects, so the calculation is speculative. It may have been relevant for previous interglacials.
   We calculate the potential final area of peatlands in three scenarios where they cover all available land with different maximum slope angles (1-3 degrees) using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The three scenarios yield potential peatland areas of 95,663 km(2) (21 % of total available area), 168,287 km2 (38 %) and 222,141 km(2) (50 %). The relative increases from the present 65,600 km(2) are 46, 157 and 239 % respectively.
   The slope scenarios give CO2 uptake rates of 8.9-10.8, 18.1-22.4 and 24.6-30.5 Mt yr(-1). Under global warming conditions with isotherms moved northwards and to higher altitudes, following an increase of raised bog area, the CO2 uptake rates might increase to 12.2-13.8, 24.4-27.7 and 33.5-37.9 Mt yr(-1); i.e. up to 4.3-4.9 vpb of atmospheric CO2. If we make the speculative extrapolation from Sweden to all high latitude peatlands, and assume that all suitable areas with slope angle <= 3 degrees become occupied, the global peatland CO2 sink might approach 3.7 Gt yr(-1) (about 2 vpm yr(-1)) and potentially cause a net radiative cooling approaching 5 W m(-2).

AB We compared the amount and composition of different aboveground biomass (BM) fractions of four mires with their net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) measured by eddy covariance. We found clear differences in response of green biomass (GBM) of plant functional types (PFTs) to water table (WT), which resulted in larger spatial variation in GBM within a mire than variation between mires. GBM varied between mires from 126 +/- 7 to 336 +/- 16 g.m(-2) (mean +/- SE), while within mire variation at largest was from 157 +/- 17 to 488 +/- 20 g.m(-2) (mean +/- SE). GBM of dominant PFTs appeared to be better in explaining the peak growing season NEE than the total BM or GBM of a mire. The differences in photosynthetic capacity between PTFs had a major role, and thus a smaller GBM with different species composition could result in higher NEE than larger GBM. Vascular plant GBM, especially that of sedges, appeared to have a high impact on NEE. Eleven PFTs, defined here, appeared to capture well the internal variation within mires, and the differences in GBM between communities were explained by the water table response of PFTs. Our results suggest the use of photosynthesizing BM, separated into PFTs, in modelling ecosystem carbon exchange instead of using just total BM.

AB Atmospheric methane concentrations decreased during the early to middle Holocene; however, the governing mechanisms remain controversial. Although it has been suggested that the mid-Holocene minimum methane emissions are associated with hydrological change, direct evidence is lacking. Here we report a new independent approach, linking hydrological change in peat sediments from the Tibetan Plateau to changes in archaeal diether concentrations and diploptene delta C-13 values as tracers for methanogenesis and methanotrophy, respectively. A minimum in inferred methanogenesis occurred during the mid-Holocene, which, locally, corresponds with the driest conditions of the Holocene, reflecting a minimum in Asian monsoon precipitation. The close coupling between precipitation and methanogenesis is validated by climate simulations, which also suggest a regionally widespread impact. Importantly, the minimum in methanogenesis is associated with a maximum in methanotrophy. Therefore, methane emissions in the Tibetan Plateau region were apparently lower during the mid-Holocene and partially controlled by interactions of large-scale atmospheric circulation.

AB 1. Components of the CO2 balance for a drained minerotrophic fen and a drained ombrotrophic bog were measured for permanent plots using static chamber techniques for 1 year before and 2 years after a rewetting treatment in part of both sites. During the same period, changes in ground and bottom layer vegetation composition were monitored.
   2. After the treatment, the water table rose, the average increase being 25 cm for the fen site and 20 cm for the bog site. In the untreated areas the average water table remained at the pretreatment level.
   3. There was a clear change in vegetation composition in the rewetted area of the fen site where the cover of cottongrass Eriophorum vaginatum L. increased drastically. The change in vegetation composition seemed to be dependent on the nutrient status of the sites, being faster at the more nutrient-rich fen site.
   4. The rates of CO2 efflux from the soil surface decreased on those rewetted plots where all vegetation had been removed. In 1996, the CO2 efflux rates from the soil surface of the untreated plots were about twice as high as from the rewetted plots with a high water table.
   5. The change in water table levels and vegetation composition affected the seasonal (mid-May to end of September) CO2-C balances. For the rewetted area of the fen site, the CO2-C balance varied from 162 to 283 g m(-2), being greatest in a plot with dense E. vaginatum cover and a high water table. For the rewetted area of the bog site, the CO2-C balance varied from 54 to 101 g m(-2), being greatest in a hollow-level plot with a high water table and mire vegetation. For the untreated areas, the CO2-C balance was close to zero (3 g m(-2) at the bog site) or negative (-183 g m(-2) at the fen site), when carbon fixation by the tree stand was omitted.
   6. The results are encouraging from the practical point of view as restoration of both fen and bog sites initiated vegetation succession and CO2-C balance development towards those of pristine mires.

AB We used moss increment counting to obtain well-defined samples of the topmost peat layers of two Sphagnum fuscum hummocks. The two ombrotrophic bogs, Lakkasuo in central Finland and Korvinsuo in eastern Finland, are of different ages, covering 3 and 9 ka, respectively. Using AMS dating, we traced bomb-produced C-14 through the topmost parts of the two peat profiles. A well-defined C-14 activity peak was found in both sequences dating the corresponding layer to AD 1965. A comparison between the maximum peat activities and the corresponding atmospheric values for the period of interest provides an opportunity to evaluate the amount of CO2 emanating from the decaying peat bog, and taken up by the living sphagnum plants.
   Considerable variations in delta(13)C values were also observed. These variations indicate, at least partly, annual variations in the emission rate of CO2 from decomposition of older peat in the bog, and are connected with climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation.

AB Carbon fluxes at two boreal peatland-dominated catchments in northeastern Alberta were investigated through the analysis of fen and lake water chemistry and the measurement of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) using headspace gas analysis. All waters had low pH (<5.3) and Gran alkalinity (<2.3 mg L-1), high DOC (>15 mg L-1), and were supersaturated with carbon dioxide (CO2) with respect to the atmosphere (CO2: 1.2-54 times atmospheric). Nonetheless, CO2 concentrations in the study lakes were significantly lower compared with surface water pools in associated fen systems. Average atmospheric flux of CO2 from the two lakes were 0.18 and 0.48 g C m (2) d (1), while potential fluxes from small surficial pools on the fen complexes were an order of magnitude higher. The higher average efflux estimated at one of the lakes (relative to the other) was attributed to shorter lake residence time and smaller relative lake area (i.e., higher relative carbon loading). Carbon mass balances for the lakes suggest that they act as conduits for dissolved CO2 from surrounding fen complexes to the atmosphere. In one of the two study catchments (with negligible groundwater sources), inputs of dissolved CO2 from fen surface waters supported a substantial component (similar to 30%) of the lake atmospheric CO2 efflux.

AB Northern peatlands are experiencing more frequent and severe fire events as a result of changing climate conditions. Recent studies show that such a fire-regime change imposes a direct climate-warming impact by emitting large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. However, the fires also convert parts of the burnt biomass into pyrogenic carbon. Here, we show a potential climate-cooling impact induced by fire-derived pyrogenic carbon in laboratory incubations. We found that the accumulation of pyrogenic carbon reduced post-fire methane production from warm (32 degrees C) incubated peatland soils by 13-24%. The redox-cycling, capacitive, and conductive electron transfer mechanisms in pyrogenic carbon functioned as an electron snorkel, which facilitated extracellular electron transfer and stimulated soil alternative microbial respiration to suppress methane production. Our results highlight an important, but overlooked, function of pyrogenic carbon in neutralizing forest fire emissions and call for its consideration in the global carbon budget estimation. Warmer and drier conditions are increasing the frequency of forest fires, which in turn produce pyrogenic carbon. Here the authors show that accumulation of pyrogenic carbon can suppress post-fire methane production in northern peatlands and can effectively buffer fire-derived greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Methane oxidation associated with the belowground tissues of a common aquatic macrophyte, the burweed Sparganium eurycarpum, was assayed in situ by a chamber technique with acetylene or methyl fluoride as a methanotrophic inhibitor at a headspace concentration of 3 to 4%. Acetylene and methyl fluoride inhibited both methane oxidation and peat methanogenesis. However, inhibition of methanogenesis resulted in no obvious short-term effect on methane fluxes. Since neither inhibitor adversely affected plant metabolism and both inhibited methanotrophy equally well, acetylene was employed for routine assays because of its low cost and ease of use, Root-associated methanotrophy consumed a variable but significant fraction of the total potential methane flux: values varied between 1 and 58% (mean +/- standard deviation, 27.0% +/- 6.0%) with no consistent temporal or spatial pattern during late summer. The absolute amount of methane oxidized was not correlated with the total potential methane flux: this suggested that parameters other than methane availability (e.g., oxygen availability) controlled the rates of methane oxidation. Estimates of diffusive methane flux and oxidation at the peat surface indicated that methane emission occurred primarily through aboveground plant tissues; the absolute magnitude of methane oxidation was also greater, in association with roots than at the peat surface. However, the relative extent of oxidation was greater at the latter locus.

AB We measured water table levels, above- and below-ground plant production, and CO2 and CH4 emissions for five fens in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, to determine whether a water diversion project was adversely affecting carbon cycling. Two fens were located beneath the water diversion, and three fens were located in an adjacent pristine watershed. The diversion lowered water table levels in one fen, while the other fen was not hydrologically modified. Total NPP (net primary production) for all sites ranged from 130 to 316 g C.m(-2).year(-1), with a mean of 217 g C.m(-2).year(-1), and belowground NPP accounted for similar to60% of the total. Maximum CO2 emissions for pristine fens ranged between 170 and 273 mg CO2-C.m(-2).h(-1), with annual emissions of 230-388 9 CO2-C.m(-2).year(-1). However, the hydrologically modified fen had maximum CO2 emissions of 457 mg CO2-C.m(-2).h(-1) and had an annual flux of 573 g CO2-C.m(-2).year(-1). Maximum CH4 emissions ranged from 3 to 25 mg CH4-C.m(-2).h(-1), with annual emissions of 9-61 g CH4-C.m(-2).year(-1). The water diversion structure lowered water tables, increased CO2, decreased CH4 and NPP, and resulted in the site likely becoming a net source of carbon.

AB Climate change will directly affect carbon and nitrogen mineralization through changes in temperature and soil moisture, but it may also indirectly affect mineralization rates through changes in soil quality. We used an experimental mesocosm system to examine the effects of 6-year manipulations of infrared loading (warming) and water-table level on the potential anaerobic nitrogen and carbon (as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) production) mineralization potentials of bog and fen peat over 11 weeks under uniform anaerobic conditions. To investigate the response of the dominant methanogenic pathways, we also analyzed the stable isotope composition of CH4 produced in the samples. Bog peat from the highest water-table treatment produced more CO2 than bog peat from drier mesocosms. Fen peat from the highest water-table treatment produced the most CH4. Cumulative nitrogen mineralization was lowest in bog peat from the warmest treatment and lowest in the fen peat from the highest water-table treatment. As all samples were incubated under constant conditions, observed differences in mineralization patterns reflect changes in soil quality in response to climate treatments. The largest treatment effects on carbon mineralization as CO2 occurred early in the incubations and were ameliorated over time, suggesting that the climate treatments changed the size and/or quality of a small labile carbon pool. CH4 from the fen peat appeared to be predominately from the acetoclastic pathway, while in the bog peat a strong CH4 oxidation signal was present despite the anaerobic conditions of our incubations. There was no evidence that changes in soil quality have lead to differences in the dominant methanogenic pathways in these systems. Overall, our results suggest that even relatively short-term changes in climate can alter the quality of peat in bogs and fens, which could alter the response of peatland carbon and nitrogen mineralization to future climate change.

AB Drained peatlands are hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which could be mitigated by rewetting and land use change. We performed an ecological/economic analysis of rewetting drained fertile peatlands in a hemiboreal climate using different land use strategies over 80 years. Vegetation, soil processes, and total GHG emissions were modeled using the CoupModel for four scenarios: (1) business as usualNorway spruce with average soil water table of -40 cm; (2) willow with groundwater at -20 cm; (3) reed canary grass with groundwater at -10 cm; and (4) a fully rewetted peatland. The predictions were based on previous model calibrations with several high-resolution datasets consisting of water, heat, carbon, and nitrogen cycling. Spruce growth was calibrated by tree-ring data that extended the time period covered. The GHG balance of four scenarios, including vegetation and soil, were 4.7, 7.1, 9.1, and 6.2 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. The total soil emissions (including litter and peat respiration CO2 + N2O + CH4) were 33.1, 19.3, 15.3, and 11.0 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1), respectively, of which the peat loss contributed 35%, 24%, and 7% of the soil emissions for the three drained scenarios, respectively. No peat was lost for the wet peatland. It was also found that draining increases vegetation growth, but not as drastically as peat respiration does. The cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is sensitive to time frame, discount rate, and carbon price. Our results indicate that the net benefit was greater with a somewhat higher soil water table and when the peatland was vegetated with willow and reed canary grass (Scenarios 2 and 3). We conclude that saving peat and avoiding methane release using fairly wet conditions can significantly reduce GHG emissions, and that this strategy should be considered for land use planning and policy-making.

AB The structural changes in the bacterial community composition of the Galitskii Mokh mesotrophic peatland (Tver oblast) after the 2010 wildfire were analyzed. Burned sites demonstrated an increase in peat water pH and mineralization, with elevated nitrate and sulfate concentrations, which resulted in doubling of the numbers of culturable sulfate reducers. Although the rate of methane oxidation by peat samples from burned sites decreased, methane emission did not increase. Enumeration of bacterial phylogenetic groups by fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed doubling of the numbers of Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in burned areas compared to an undamaged site, while a reverse pattern was observed for Deltaproteobacteria and Planctomycetes. Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA clone libraries revealed shifts in the bacterial community composition in the peat from burned sites. Slowly growing bacteria of the phyla Verrucomicrobia and Planctomycetes were replaced by fast-growing colonizers from the Proteobacteria. The originally diverse Actinobacterial community was replaced by the one dominated by the phylotypes related to thermophilic Aciditerrimonas ferrireducens. In the Acidobacteria, a typical group of peat-inhabiting bacteria, the subgroups 3, 6, and 17 were replaced by subgroups 7 and 10. These changes in the structure of peatland microbial communities could result in disturbances of some biospheric functions of these ecosystems.

AB The ability of Dutch grassland soil and Dutch peat soil for methane oxidation was investigated. The kinetics of methane oxidation by soil from different depths were determined in batch cultures incubated with 1; 10; 100; and 10,000 ppmv methane, respectively. All 4 applied concentrations of methane were degraded by both types of soil. Thereby, the highest oxidative activities were observed between 5 and 10 cm soil depth. Most importantly, these experiments demonstrated that this soil acts as a sink for methane even at concentrations well below 1 ppmv. Especially at higher methane concentrations (100 - 10,000 ppmv) much higher degradation rates were found in the peat soil. This also correlates with the higher methane production rates which had been observed in peat soil. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Methane emissions from peatlands contribute significantly to atmospheric CH4 levels and play an essential role in the global carbon cycle. The stable carbon isotopic composition (delta C-1(3)) of bacterial and plant lipids has been used to study modern and past peatland biogeochemistry, especially methane cycling. However, the small number of recent peatlands that have been characterised and the lack of consistency between target compounds means that this approach lacks a rigorous framework. Here, we undertake a survey of bacterial and plant lipid delta C-1(3) values in peatlands from different geographic regions, spanning a wide range of temperature (-8 to 27 degrees C) and pH (similar to 3 to 8), to generate a reference dataset and probe drivers of isotopic variability. Within our dataset, the carbon fixation pathway predominantly determines leaf wax (n-alkane) delta C-1(3) values. Bacterial-derived C-31 hopane delta C-1(3) values track those of leaf waxes but are relatively enriched (0 to 10%), indicating a heterotrophic ecology and preferential consumption of C-13-enriched substrates (e.g. carbohydrates). In contrast, <= C-30 hopanoids can be strongly C-13-depleted and indicate the incorporation of isotopically light methane into the bacterial community, especially at near neutral pH (similar to 5-6 pH). Previous analysis of Eocene sediments has suggested isotopic decoupling between C-31 and <= C-30 hopanoid delta C-1(3) values. Our work suggests a globally widespread decoupling in recent peatlands; this persists despite the profound diversity of hopanoid producing bacteria and associated controls on their delta C-1(3) values and it has significant implications for future work. Re-analysis of published data from: (1) the (mid-to-early) Holocene and late Glacial, and (2) latest Paleocene and earliest Eocene in this revised context highlights that perturbations to the peatland methane cycle occurred during the past, and we envisage that this approach could provide unique (qualitative) insights into methane cycling dynamics throughout the geological record.

AB An extended water regime model was used for calculating the evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and peat mineralization (CO2 and N release) for various fen locations with grassland utilization in dependence on the groundwater level. The results show that an increasing groundwater level leads to a strong decline of the actual evapotranspiration E-t. For example, increasing the groundwater level from 30 to 120 cm diminishes the E-t by up to 230 mm a(-1). A positive groundwater recharge only takes place at groundwater levels of 90 cm and more. At smaller distances the capillary rise into the rooting zone during the summer months is greater than the water seepage during the winter months, so that a negative groundwater recharge-balance is reached in the course of a year. The CO2- and the N-release, as well as the annual decline in peat thickness, increase significantly with rising groundwater levels. The results show that varying the groundwater level can influence the water regime and the peat mineralization significantly. The lower the groundwater level the less is the peat decomposition. The demand for a groundwater level as small as possible is, however; limited by an agricultural utilization of the fens. Choosing the optimum groundwater level should consider the aims (1) peat mineralization, (2) gas emission (CO2, CH4; N2O), and (3) crop production. If a grassland utilization is supposed to be made possible and all three aims above are given equal importance, the groundwater level should be maintained at 30 cm. At this distance, about 90 % of the optimum plant output can be reached. The peat mineralization can be reduced to 30 to 40 % of the maximum peat mineralization. The gas emission amounts to -50-60 % of the maximum value.

AB Reversals in hydraulic head and extensive methane losses were identified during a drought cycle from changes in hydraulic-head and dissolved-methane profiles in peat, Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands, northern Minnesota, United States. During the summer 1990 drought, regional ground water discharged from the mineral soil underlying the peat to raised bogs. Concentrations of dissolved CH4 in pore water showed that much of the peat column was supersaturated with respect to a reference standard of 1 atm partial pressure CH4. By the summer of 1991, the severity of the drought lessened, and the upper peat column was resaturated with precipitation-derived water. Ground-water flow was then controlled by local, precipitation-driven, recharge flow systems, and the regional ground water that was discharged affected only the peat immediately above the mineral soil-peat interface. In contrast, during the summer of 1991, concentrations of dissolved CH4 in pore water were all undersaturated with respect to 1 atm partial pressure CH4. The decrease in the amount of dissolved CH4 in the pore water from the summer of 1990 to the summer of 1991 probably was caused by changes in the CH4 flux and degassing to the unsaturated zone and to a lesser extent by changes in the partial pressure of gaseous CH4 in the peat as the peat volume increased with expansion as it resaturated.

AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from pristine peatlands and peatlands drained for agriculture, forestry or peat extraction have been studied intensively. However, few studies have compared GHG emissions from peatlands under different land-use type within the same peatland area. This study examined methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and respiration (CO2) from a peatland complex in northern Finland, including a peatland used for grass cultivation, a Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens dominated forested peatland, a peat-extraction site and a pristine mire. Gas fluxes were measured in 2011 and 2012 with chambers during the snow-free period, and using the snow-gradient method in winter 2012/2013. Soil respiration was highest in the cultivated site (median during growing season 350 mg CO, m(-2) h(-1)), and lower in the forest site and in the peat-extraction site (median for growing season 49 and 130 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), respectively). The peat-extraction site and the cultivated site were large sources of N2O during the growing season (median 89 and 28 pig m(-2) h(-1), respectively) and during the winter (median 56 and 460 mu g m(-2) h(-1), respectively). The pristine site was a large source of CH4 during the growing season (median 0.98 mg m(-2) h(-1)), whereas CH4 emissions from the drained sites during the growing season were minor. However, during winter, the peat-extraction site and the cultivated site emitted CH4 (median 0.58 and 0.029 mg m(-2) h(-1), respectively). The cultivated site had the highest estimated CO2 equivalent emissions, due to the high CO2 and N2O fluxes, but the peat-extraction site also had large annual emissions, mainly as N2O. The study suggests that rising ground-water level from 60 to 40 cm could potentially mitigate the emissions from the cultivated site.

   PATHWAYS
AB Northern peatlands consist of a mosaic of peatland types that vary spatially and temporally and differ in their methane (CH4) production. Microbial community composition and environment both potentially control the processes that release carbon from anoxic peat either as CH4 or as carbon dioxide (CO2), a less potent greenhouse gas than CH4. However, the respective roles of these controls remain unclear, which prevents incorporating microbes in the predictions of peatland CH4 emissions.
   Here, a reciprocal transplant experiment was carried out to separate the influences of microbial community and environment in CH4 and anaerobic CO2 production. Peat from an acidic Sphagnum bog and a sedge fen with higher pH was enclosed in membrane bags with a pore size of 0.2 mu m, preventing microbial colonization from the outside, and transplanted in the field for 2 months.
   Potential CH4 production was primarily controlled by the environment. The conditions in the bog suppressed the initially higher activity of fen methanogens and reduced CH4 production by 79%. Against expectations, the inhibition was not specific to acetate-using Methanotrichaceae. Reciprocal transplantation favoured Methanosarcinaceae and potentially methylotrophic methanogenesis in general. Bog methanogens, mostly hydrogenotrophic Methanoregulaceae, retained their community structure and activity in the fen with a slight increase (+37%) in CH4 production.
   Anaerobic CO2 production was controlled by both the microbial community and the environment. Transplantation led to increased CO2 production in both bog (+50%) and fen peat (+57%) with distinct bacterial community, showing that the new environment directed more carbon to other anaerobic processes than methanogenesis.
   Taken together, these results relate differences in CH4 production of bogs and fens to ecophysiology of specific methanogen groups. The sensitiveness of fen methanogens to the acidic conditions in Sphagnum bogs can help explain the decrease in CH4 emission in the typical boreal peatland succession from young fens to older bogs. Increase in anaerobic CO2 versus CH4 production with transplantation shows that disturbances of boreal peatlands can activate poorly defined pathways of anaerobic decomposition.

AB Due to their high emission potential, the reporting of CO2 emissions from peatlands requires exact emission factors for different land use categories. Recently used emission factors are mainly based on CO2 flux measurements by chamber techniques or the micrometeorological eddy covariance (EC) method. However, evidence about the reliability and comparability of annual CO2 balances based on these methods is scarce. Therefore, manual chamber measurements of ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were conducted for two years (March 2012-April 2014) to model annual balances of two sites on fen soils with different land use intensity in northern Germany: an unutilized and rewetted grassland (UG) and an intensively utilized wet grassland (GW). Simultaneously, EC measurements of NEE were conducted on the sites. Two reasons for occasionally great deviations in NEE between the methods could be observed: (1) the accordance of both methods was most hampered during transition periods such as the beginning of the growing season and the onset of regrowth after a grassland defoliation due to different spatial scales of EC and chamber measurements and (2) R-ECO and gross primary production (GPP) partitioned from EC NEE measurements were systematically lower than those from the chamber-based model, which could be a result of the EC energy balance gap. Differences were more pronounced for the managed site GW as a result of more frequent regrowth periods. It is concluded that the EC and chamber method can show comparable results for the CO2 exchange of grasslands on fen soils when the limitations of both methods are known and considered for the reporting of emission factors. These limitations are due to energy balance closure and potentially biased footprints for EC and a restricted representativeness especially during early stages of plant development for the chamber method.

AB We incubated intact peat cores from depth intervals of 5-15, 15-25, 25-35, and 35-45 cm from ombrotrophic bog, poor fen, and beaver pond margin sections of a cool-temperate peatland. CO2 production was measured over 12-day incubation periods at 4 and 14 degrees C and under oxic and anoxic conditions. Rates ranged from 0.06 to 0.66 mg CO2 g(-1) dry peat d(-1) under oxic conditions and from 0.002 to 0.098 mg CO2 g(-1) d(-1) under anoxic conditions, and rates generally decreased with depth in the profiles. When expressed on a volumetric basis, production rates ranged from 0.3 to 23.4 g CO2 m(-3) d(-1), and there was much less variation in CO2 production rates within profiles because the bull; density of peat increased with depth. The Q(10) quotient, between 4 and 14 degrees C, ranged from 1.0 to 7.7, depending on sample and incubation conditions, with an average of 2.0 for oxic and 2.7 for anoxic conditions. Oxic:anoxic ratios averaged 7:1, 16:1, and 12:1 for the bog, poor fen, and beaver pond margin samples, respectively. Degree of decomposition (von Post index) was the substrate property most strongly correlated with CO2 production. Based on temperature and incubation data for the peat profiles to a depth of 45 cm, annual decomposition values (k) ranged from 0.016 to 0.060 yr(-1) under oxic conditions and from 0.001 to 0.007 yr(-1) under anoxic conditions. A model of CO2 emission from the three sites, based on the incubation data and thermal and water table regime, gave good agreement with measured in Situ CO2 emission rates (r(2) = 0.72, n = 18), although summer emission rates were underpredicted, possibly because of the absence of a root production component in the incubations or because of underestimation of CO2 production rates in held conditions above the water table.

AB Discontinuous permafrost in peatlands has recently been melting across western Canada, creating wet Sphagnum-Carex lawns (internal lawns) interspersed within drier ombrotrophic bog. Permafrost degradation alters peat hydrology, thermal regimes and plant species assemblages, all of which could affect gaseous C emissions in peatlands. We quantified CO2 and CH4 fluxes across the peat-atmosphere boundary using dark static chambers in adjacent internal lawns, continental bogs and frost mounds in an area of localized permafrost in north-central Saskatchewan. Carbon dioxide and CH4 fluxes ranged from 0.2 to 14.6 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) and from -24 to 344 mumol CH4, respectively, and differed significantly among peatland types and sampling dates. Our estimates of CH4 flux are low compared to previous estimates from boreal wetlands, with net consumption of CH4 typically in frost mounds. Permafrost melt in our study area is associated with 1.6- and 30-fold increases in CO2 and CH4 emissions, respectively. More widespread thaw across the discontinuous permafrost region will be an important consideration to boreal C budgets with future climatic changes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Permafrost peatlands are a significant source of methane (CH4) emissions to the atmosphere and could emit more CH4 with continued permafrost thaw. Aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria may attenuate a substantial fraction of CH4 emissions in thawing permafrost peatlands; however, the impact of permafrost thaw on CH4 oxidation is uncertain. We measured potential CH4 oxidation rates (hereafter, CH4 oxidation) and their predictors using laboratory incubations and in situ porewater redox chemistry across a permafrost thaw gradient of eight thaw stages at Stordalen Mire, a permafrost peatland complex in northernmost Sweden. Methane oxidation rates increased across a gradient of permafrost thaw and differed in transitional thaw stages relative to end-member stages. Oxidation was consistently higher in submerged fens than in bogs or palsas across a range of CH4 concentrations. We also observed that CH4 oxidation increased with decreasing in situ redox potential and was highest in sites with lower redox potential (Eh < 10 mV) and high water table. Our results suggest that redox potential can be used as an important predictor of CH4 oxidation, especially in thawed permafrost peatlands. Our results also highlight the importance of considering transitional thaw stages when characterizing landscape-scale CH4 dynamics, because these transitional areas have different rates and controls of CH4 oxidation relative to intact or completely thawed permafrost areas. As permafrost thaw increases the total area of semiwet and wet thaw stages in permafrost peatlands, CH4 oxidation represents an important control on CH4 emissions to the atmosphere.

AB We made an experiment on a 30 cm. diameter core of Sphagnum-dominated vegetation and peat to estimate the parameters controlling methane oxidation during movement to the ambient air: 13 CH4 was added at the water table, and excess 13 CO2 appeared in the gas space above the core. At 20 degreesC in otherwise undisturbed conditions, similar to 22% of CH4 was oxidized to CO2 during passage up through the overlying 10-cm thick unsaturated peat and plants. We simulated the experiment, with seven parameters: transfer coefficients in water, in the gas phase, and through the container wall; the rate of CH4 and Of CO2 generation; and the two parameters of a hyperbolic relation between CH4 concentration and the rate of CH4 oxidation. We optimized these parameters to fit the experimental results, and then were able to generalize to any temperature (0 degrees -25 degreesC) and any depth (0-55 cm) of water table. Changing temperature has important effects on the proportion of CH4 oxidized.

AB Closed chamber measurements for methane emission estimation are often carried out with opaque chambers to avoid heating of the headspace. However, mainly in wetlands, some plants possess an internal convective gas transport which quickly responds to changes in irradiation. These plants have also been found to often channel a large part of the released methane in temperate fens. We compare methane fluxes derived from transparent versus opaque chambers on Carex-, Phragmites-, and Typha-dominated stands of a temperate fen. Transparent chamber fluxes almost doubled opaque chamber fluxes in the convective transporting Phragmites stand. In Typha, a trend of higher fluxes determined with the transparent chambers was detectable, whereas in Carex, transparent and opaque chamber fluxes did not differ significantly. Thus, opaque chambers bias the outcome of methane measurements, depending on dominant vegetation. We recommend the use of transparent chambers when determining emissions of convective plants or extrapolating fluxes to larger scales.

AB The ability to predict the effects of climate change on trace gas fluxes requires a knowledge of microbial temperature responses. However, the response of a microbial community to temperature in a given substrate may be complicated by its thermal history. To examine the effect of sequentially changing temperature on methane and carbon dioxide production in different peat types, we incubated anaerobic peat samples from 3 types of northern peatlands, a bog, a sedge fen and a cedar swamp, in both rising and falling temperature regimes. Graphic and statistical comparisons of the different temperature regimes suggest hysteresis in microbial response to temperature, although the absolute rates at any given temperature often did not differ. Where regressions for temperature response (Arrhenius plots) were significant, they generally differed between temperature regimes. The greatest differences among treatments occurred during the first half of the 40-d incubation. Increases in carbon dioxide production were similar across all peat types, but methanogenesis varied widely: methane production was uniformly low in the bog peat but increased sharply with temperature in the other two peat types. The complicating effect of history or chronology on substrate responses to environmental stimuli may restrain our ability to model the responses of complex systems to changing conditions.

AB Measurements of landscape-scale methane emission were made over an aapa mire near Kaamanen in Finnish Lapland (69 degrees 8' N, 27 degrees 16' E, 155 m ASL. Emissions were measured during the spring thaw, in summer and in autumn. No effect of water table position on CH4 emission was found as the water table remained at or above the surface of the peat. Methane emission fluxes increased with surface temperature from which an activation energy of -99 kJ mol(-1) was obtained. Annual emission from the site, modelled from temperature regression and short-term flux measurements made in three separate years, was calculated to be 5.5 +/- 0.4 g CH4 m(-2) y(-1) of which 0.6 +/-0.1 g CH4 m(-2) y(-1) (11%) was released during the spring thaw which lasted 20 to 30 days.
   The effect of global warming on the CH4 budget of the site was estimated using the central scenario of the SILMU (Finnish Research Programme on Climate Change) model which predicts annual mean temperature increases of 1.2, 2.4 and 4.4 degreesC in 2020, 2050 and 2100, respectively. Maximum enhancements in CH4 emission due to warming were calculated to be 18, 40 and 84% for 2020, 2050 and 2100, respectively. Actual increases may be smaller because prediction of changes in water table are highly uncertain.

AB Methane production and consumption activities were examined in a Massachusetts peatland. Feat from depths of 5-35 cm incubated under anaerobic conditions, produced an average of 2 nmol CH4 g(-1) h(-1) with highest rates for peat fractions between 25-30 cm depth. Extracted microbial nucleic acids showed the strongest relative hybridization with a 16S rRNA oligonucleotide probe specific for Archaea with samples from the 25-30 cm depth. In aerobic laboratory incubations, the peat consumed methane with a maximum velocity of 67 nmol CH4 g(-1) h(-1) and a K-s of 1.6 mu M. Methane consumption activity was concentrated 4-9 cm below the peat surface, which corresponds to the aerobic, partially decomposed region in this peatland, Phospholipid fatty acid analysis of peat fractions demonstrated an abundance of methanotrophic bacteria within the region of methane consumption activity. Increases in temperature up to 30 degrees C produced an increase in methane consumption rates for shallow samples, but not for samples taken from depths greater than 9 cm. Nitrogen fixation experiments were carried out using N-15(2) uptake in order to avoid problems associated with inhibition of methanotrophy. These experiments demonstrated that methane in peat samples did not stimulate nitrogen fixation activity, nor could activity be correlated with the presence of methanotrophic bacteria in peat fractions.

AB Peatland streams typically contain high methane concentrations and act as conduits for the release of this greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. Radiocarbon analysis provides a unique tracer that can be used to identify the methane source, and quantify the time elapsed between carbon fixation and return to the atmosphere as CH4. Few studies - those that have focus largely on sites with bubble (ebullition) emissions - have investigated the C-14 age of methane in surface waters because of the difficulty in collecting sufficient CH4 for analysis. Here, we describe new sampling methods for the collection of CH4 samples from CH4-oversaturated peatland streams for radiocarbon analysis. We report the results of a suite of tests, including using methane C-14 standards and replicated field measurements, to verify the methods. The methods are not restricted to ebullition sites, and can be applied to peatland streams with lower methane concentrations. We report the C-14 age of methane extracted from surface water samples (4-13l) at two contrasting locations in a temperate raised peat bog. Results indicate substantial spatial variation with ages ranging from 400 (ditch in afforested peatland) to 3000years BP (bog perimeter stream). These contrasting ages suggest that methane in stream water can be derived from a wide range of peat depths. This new method provides a rapid (10-15min per sample) and convenient approach, which should make (CH4)-C-14 dating of surface water more accessible and lead to an increased understanding of carbon cycling within the soil-water-atmosphere system.

AB Boreal peat-forming wetlands, mires, are globally important sources of methane and sinks for CO2. As peatland vegetation plays a significant role regulating the exchange of these greenhouse gases, we have assessed the responses of the dominant plants and ecosystem functions to increasing tropospheric ozone concentration and enhanced ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation in long-term experiments, the results of which are summarized in this review. The dominant sedge, Eriophorum vaginatum, and especially the Sphagnum mosses common on peatlands, appear fairly tolerant to the future predicted ozone levels. Similarly, UV-B radiation only caused few alterations in the carbohydrates and pigments of the dominant sedge, Eriophorum russeolum, and had no effects on the dominant moss species of the experimental site, Warnstorfia exannulata. Surprisingly, there were alterations in organic acid concentrations in the peat pore water and peat microbial community composition in both experiments. Elevated ozone caused a transient decrease in ecosystem-level gross photosynthesis and methane (CH4) emission, which shifted to a slight increase later on. Enhanced UV-B decreased dark ecosystem respiration and increased CH4 emission in the course of the six measurement years. The emission of isoprene was increased by both ozone and UV-B during warm weather periods, suggesting interactive effects with temperature. All in all, we suggest that ozone and UV-B have limited effects on the carbon cycle in boreal peatlands, because other environmental factors, such as temperature, water level and photosynthetically active radiation more strongly regulate CO2 and CH4 exchange rates.

AB Large areas of peatlands in Germany and the Netherlands are affected by drainage and high nitrogen deposition. Sheep grazing is a common extensive management activity on drained peatlands, in particular on nature protection areas. However, input of easily mineralisable material such as sheep excrements could enhance degradation of soil organic carbon (C-org), thereby increasing the effect of these ecosystems on national GHG budgets. Thus, a microcosm experiment on the influence of sheep excreta on GHG emissions from a histic Gleysol with strongly degraded peat was set up. The N-15 and C-13 stable isotope tracer technique was used to partition sources of CO2 and N2O. Labeled sheep faeces and urine were obtained by feeding enriched material. Undisturbed soil columns were treated with surface application of urine, faeces or mixtures of both in different label combinations to distinguish between direct effects and possible priming effects. Incubation was done under stable temperature and precipitation conditions. Fluxes as well as N-15 and C-13 enrichment of N2O and CO2, respectively, were measured for three weeks. Addition of sheep excreta increased emission of total CO2 in proportion to the added carbon amounts. There was no CO2 priming in the peat. No effect on CH4 and N2O was observed under the aerobic experimental conditions. The N2O-N source shifted from peat to excreta, which indicates negative priming, but priming was not significant. The results indicate that sheep excreta do not significantly increase GHG emissions from degraded peat soils. Considering the degraded peatland preserving benefits, sheep grazing on peatlands affected by drainage and high nitrogen deposition should be further promoted. (C) 2015 The Authors.

TI Drought years in peatland rewetting: rapid vegetation succession can

AB The rewetting of peatlands is regarded as an important nature-based climate solution and intended to reconcile climate protection with the restoration of self-regulating ecosystems that are resistant to climate impacts. Although the severity and frequency of droughts are predicted to increase as a consequence of climate change, it is not well understood whether such extreme events can jeopardize rewetting measures. The goal of this study was to better understand drought effects on vegetation development and the exchange of the two important greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4, especially in rewetted fens. Based on long-term reference records, we investigated anomalies in vegetation dynamics, CH4 emissions, and net CO2 exchange, including the component fluxes of ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), in a rewetted fen during the extreme European summer drought in 2018. Drought-induced vegetation dynamics were derived from remotely sensed data.
   Since flooding in 2010, the fen was characterized by a patchy mosaic of open-water surfaces and vegetated areas. After years of stagnant vegetation development, drought acted as a trigger event for pioneer species such as Tephroseris palustris and Ranunculus sceleratus to rapidly close persistent vegetation gaps. The massive spread of vegetation assimilated substantial amounts of CO2. In 2018, the annual GEP budget increased by 20 % in comparison to average years (2010-2017). R-eco increased even by 40 %, but enhanced photosynthetic CO2 sequestration could compensate for half of the drought-induced increase in respiratory CO2 release. Altogether, the restored fen remained a net CO2 sink in the year of drought, though net CO2 sequestration was lower than in other years. CH4 emissions were 20 % below average on an annual basis, though stronger reduction effects occurred from August onwards, when daily fluxes were 60 % lower than in reference years.
   Our study reveals an important regulatory mechanism of restored fens to maintain their net CO2 sink function even in extremely dry years. It appears that, in times of more frequent climate extremes, fen restoration can create ecosystems resilient to drought. However, in order to comprehensively assess the mitigation prospects of peatland rewetting as a nature-based climate solution, further research needs to focus on the long-term effects of such extreme events beyond the actual drought period.

AB The northern wetlands are one of the major sources of methane into the atmosphere. We measured annual methane emission from a boreal minerotrophic fen, Siikaneva, by the eddy covariance method. The average wintertime emissions were below 1 mg m(-2) h(-1), and the summertime emissions about 3.5 mg m(-2) h(-1). The water table depth did have any clear effect on methane emissions. During most of the year the emission depended on the temperature of peat below the water table. However, during the high and late summer the emission was independent on peat temperature as well. No diurnal cycle of methane flux was found. The total annual emission from the Siikaneva site was 12.6 g m(-2). The emissions of the snow free period contributed 91% to the annual emission. The emission pulse during the snow melting period was clearly detectable but of minor importance adding only less than 3% to the annual emission. Over 20% of the carbon assimilated during the year as carbon dioxide was emitted as methane. Thus methane emission is an important component of the carbon balance of the Siikaneva fen. This indicates need of taking methane into account when studying carbon balances of northern fen ecosystems.

AB Globally peatlands store 500 Gt carbon (C), with northern blanket bogs accumulating 23 g C m(-2) y(-1) due to cool wet conditions. As a sink of carbon dioxide (CO2) peat bogs slow anthropogenic climate change, but warming climate increases the likelihood of drought which may reduce net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and increase soil respiration, tipping C sinks to sources. High water tables make bogs a globally important source of methane (CH4), another greenhouse gas (GHG) with a global warming potential (GWP) 34 times that of CO2. Warming may increase CH4 emissions, but drying may cause a reduction. Predicted species composition changes may also influence GHG balance, due to different traits such as erenchyma, e.g., Eriophorum vaginatum (eriophorum) and non-aerenchymatous species, e.g., Calluna vulgaris (heather). To understand how these ecosystems will respond to climate change, it is vital to measure GHG responses to drought at the species level. An automated chamber system, SkyLine2D, measured NEE and CH4 fluxes near-continuously from an ombrotrophic fen from August 2017 to September 2019. Four ecotypes were identified: sphagnum (Sphagnum spp), eriophorum, heather and water, hypothesizing that fluxes would significantly differ between ecotypes. The 2018 drought allowed comparison of fluxes between drought and non-drought years (May to September), and their recovery the following year. Methane emissions differed between ecotypes (p < 0.02), ordered high to low: eriophorum > sphagnum > water > heather, ranging from 23 to 8 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1). Daily NEE was similar between ecotypes (p > 0.7), but under 2018 drought conditions all ecotypes were greater sources of CO2 compared to 2019, losing 1.14 g and 0.24 g CO2-C m(-2) d(-1) respectively (p < 0.001). CH4 emissions were ca. 40% higher during 2018 than 2019, 17 mg compared to 12 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) (p < 0.0001), and fluxes exhibited hysteresis with water table depth. A lag of 84-88 days was observed between rising water table and increased CH4 emissions. A significant interaction between ecotype and year showed fluxes from open water did not return to pre-drought levels. Our findings suggest that short-term drought may lead to a net increase in C emissions from northern wetlands.

AB Peatland methane (CH4) fluxes may vary between plant types; however, in mixed communities, the specific role of each species is difficult to distinguish. The goal of this study was to determine the individual and interacting effect of moss, graminoid and shrub plant functional types on CH4 dynamics of experimentally planted plots in a rewetted minerotrophic peatland.
   We measured CH4 flux, pore water CH4 concentration and CH4 production and oxidation potential in pure stands of reintroduced Tomenthypnum nitens (Hedw.) Loeske, Carex aquatilis Wahlenb, or Myrica gale L., as well as mixtures of T. nitens + C. aquatilis and T. nitens + M. gale. Methane flux was also measured on bare peat plots.
   The presence of both the graminoid C. aquatilis and the shrub M. gale resulted in the highest CH4 production potential in near surface peat (10 cm). The presence of moss (T. nitens) and C. aquatilis significantly increased CH4 oxidation potential. Water table position was a significant control on CH4 flux, but the presence of C. aquatilis maintained higher flux even at dry plots. Plots including C. aquatilis had significantly lower pore water CH4 concentration at 30 cm depth, likely reflecting CH4 oxidation and transport.
   Management of restored sites aiming to reduce CH4 flux should focus on hydrology, i.e. water table position. The presence of graminoids enhances CH4 flux, while moss presence may result in lower CH4 emission.

AB Peatlands can export large amounts of carbon in various forms, including surface gas emissions and the discharge of dissolved carbon under aerobic/anaerobic soil degradation. Therefore, an apparent imbalance can be expected between gaseous CO2 production and O-2 consumption in unsaturated peat layers. The present study monitored profiles of soil CO2 and O-2 in Bibai mire, Hokkaido, Japan, with the aim of examining the apparent imbalance between the two gases. The CO2 abundance to the atmospheric level did not exceed the O-2 deficit because the CO2 concentrations were 0.21, 0.75 and 2.92%, whereas the O-2 concentrations were 19.71, 18.05 and 9.51% at depths of 10, 20 and 30 cm, respectively. This shortage of CO2 abundance implied that a remarkable amount of CO2 dissolved into the liquid phase. The dissolved CO2 mass on the basis of Henry's law ranged from 1.72 to 159.3 mmol m(-2) (10 cm)(-1), and was 1.59-5.25-fold greater than the gaseous CO2 mass. The mass balance analyses showed that the CO2 production rate in the gaseous phase at a depth of 20 cm ranged from 6.52 to 23.11 mmol m(-2) (10 cm)(-1) day(-1), equivalent to 43% on average of the O-2 consumption rate. This CO2 production rate contributed to less than 10% of the gaseous CO2 produced in the unsaturated peat layer, which had a maximum thickness of 40 cm, implying the existence of a large CO2 source in the peat layer, including in the saturated zone. The mass balance analyses also showed that the residence time of CO2 in the gaseous phase alone was 0.351 day, whereas that in the whole peat soil matrix was 0.919 day at a depth of approximately 20 cm, suggesting that high water content serves as a tentative storage for gaseous CO2 in peatlands.

AB Wetlands were the largest source of atmospheric methane (CH4) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), but the sensitivity of this source to exceptionally low atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) at the time has not been examined experimentally. We tested the hypothesis that LGM atmospheric [CO2] reduced CH4 emissions as a consequence of decreased photosynthate allocation to the rhizosphere.
   We exposed minerotrophic fen and ombrotrophic bog peatland mesocosms to simulated LGM (c. 200 ppm) or ambient (c. 400 ppm) [CO2] over 21 months (n = 8 per treatment) and measured gaseous CH4 flux, pore water dissolved CH4 and volatile fatty acid (VFA; an indicator of plant carbon supply to the rhizosphere) concentrations.
   Cumulative CH4 flux from fen mesocosms was suppressed by 29% (P < 0.05) and rhizosphere pore water [CH4] by c. 50% ( P < 0.01) in the LGM [CO2], variables that remained unaffected in bog mesocosms. VFA analysis indicated that changes in plant root exudates were not the driving mechanism behind these results.
   Our data suggest that the LGM [CO2] suppression of wetland CH4 emissions is contingent on trophic status. The heterogeneous response may be attributable to differences in species assemblage that influence the dominant CH4 production pathway, rhizosphere supplemented photosynthesis and CH4 oxidation.

AB Human activities have enhanced the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from organic soils. Drained peat soils may turn into a source of CO2 and N2O, whereas CH4 emission may generally decrease after drainage. Agricultural use, including ploughing, fertilization and irrigation, further enhances the decomposition of peat, and CO2 and N2O emissions. Cultivated organic soils are therefore significant sources of CO2 and N2O. In this paper we report greenhouse gas emissions from cultivated organic soils, and from abandoned organic agricultural soils, i.e. from organic soils where cultivation practices have ceased. We found that CO2 and N2O emissions from abandoned organic cropland soils do not generally decrease with time after agricultural practices have ceased, whereas CH4 fluxes from the atmosphere into the soil may gradually increase after leaving cultivation.

AB Peatlands are an important source of the atmospheric greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Although CH4 cycling and fluxes have been quantified for many northern peatlands, imprecision in process-based approaches to predicting CH4 emissions suggests that our understanding of underlying processes is incomplete. Microbial anaerobic oxidation of CH4 (AOM) is an important CH4 sink in marine sediments, but AOM has only recently been identified in a few nonmarine systems. We used C-13 isotope tracers and followed the fate of C-13 into CO2 and peat in order to study the geographic extent, relative importance, and biogeochemistry of AOM in 15 North American peatlands spanning a similar to 1500 km latitudinal transect that varied in hydrology, vegetation, and soil chemistry. For the first time, we demonstrate that AOM is a widespread and quantitatively important process across many peatland types and that anabolic microbial assimilation of CH4-C occurs. However, AOM rate is not predicted by CH4 production rates and the primary mechanism of C assimilation remains uncertain. AOM rates are higher in fen than bog sites, suggesting electron acceptor constraints on AOM. Nevertheless, AOM rates were not correlated with porewater ion concentrations or stimulated following additions of nitrate, sulfate, or ferric iron, suggesting that an unidentified electron acceptor(s) must drive AOM in peatlands. Globally, we estimate that AOM could consume a large proportion of CH4 produced annually (1.6-49 Tg) and thereby constrain emissions and greenhouse gas forcing.

AB Sedge-dominated wetlands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau are methane emission centers. Methanotrophs at these sites play a role in reducing methane emissions, but relatively little is known about the composition of active methanotrophs in these wetlands. Here, we used DNA stable isotope probing to identify the key active aerobic methanotrophs in three sedge-dominated wetlands on the plateau. We found that Methylocystis species were active in two peatlands, Hongyuan and Dangxiong. Methylobacter species were found to be active only in Dangxiong peat. Hongyuan peat had the highest methane oxidation rate, and cross-feeding of carbon from methanotrophs to methylotrophic Hyphomicrobium species was observed. Owing to a low methane oxidation rate during the incubation, the labeling of methanotrophs in Maduo wetland samples was not detected. Our results indicate that there are large differences in the activity of methanotrophs in the wetlands of this region.

ID NORTHERN PEATLANDS; WATER-TABLE; WETLANDS; FLUXES
AB Methane (CH4) fluxes from drainage ditches and adjoining strips between the ditches were measured in fall 1995 at a drained mire in Finland. The fluxes were measured at different mire sites using static chambers (diffusion and plant-mediated transport) and inverted funnels (ebullition). The emissions (chamber measurements) of CH4 from drainage ditch bottoms, ditch sides, and strips between ditches ranged from 0 to 595 mg.m(-2).d(-1), from 0 to 78 mg.m(-2).d(-1), and from -3 to 33 mg.m(-2).d(-1), respectively. The ebullition of CH4 from ditches was rather small, ranging from 3 to 37 mg CH4.m(-2).d(-1), which was less than 10% of the CH4 flux measured by the chambers. As the proportion of ditches of the total peatland area is rather small, the inclusion of methane fluxes from ditches would not considerably change the previous estimates of the effect of drainage on the greenhouse gas balance of Finnish peatlands.

AB Upscaling the properties and effects of small-scale surface heterogeneities to larger scales is a challenging issue in land surface modeling. We developed a novel approach to upscale local methane emissions in a boreal peatland from the micro-topographic scale to the landscape scale. We based this new parameterization on the analysis of the water table pattern generated by the Hummock-Hollow model, a microtopography resolving model for peatland hydrology. We introduce this parameterization of methane hotspots in a global model-like version of the Hummock-Hollow model that underestimates methane emissions. We tested the robustness of the parameterization by simulating methane emissions for the next century, forcing the model with three different RCP scenarios. The Hotspot parameterization, despite being calibrated for the 1976-2005 climatology, mimics the output of the micro-topography resolving model for all the simulated scenarios. The new approach bridges the scale gap of methane emissions between this version of the model and the configuration explicitly resolving micro-topography.

AB Many peatlands were affected by drainage in the past, and restoration of their water regime aims to bring back their original functions. The purpose of our study was to simulate re-wetting of soils of different types of drained peatlands (bogs and minerotrophic mires, located in the Sumava Mountains, Czech Republic) under laboratory conditions (incubation for 15 weeks) and to assess possible risks of peatland water regime restoration - especially nutrient leaching and the potentials for CO2 and CH4 production. After re-wetting of soils sampled from drained peatlands (simulated by anaerobic incubation) (i) phosphorus concentration (SRP) did not change in any soil, (ii) concentration of ammonium and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) increased, but only in a drained fen, (iii) DOC increased significantly in the drained fen and degraded drained bog, (iv) CO2 production decreased, (v) CH4 production and the number of methanogens increased in all soils, and (vi) archaeal methanogenic community composition was also affected by re-wetting: it differed significantly between drained and pristine fens, whereas it was more similar between drained and pristine bogs. Overall, the soils from fens reacted more dynamically to re-wetting than the bogs, and therefore, some nutrients (especially nitrogen) and DOC leaching may be expected from drained fens after their water regime restoration. However, if compared to their state before restoration, ammonium and phosphorus leaching should not increase and leaching of nitrates and DON should even decrease after restoration, especially during the vegetation season. Further, CO2 production in soils of fens and bogs should decrease after their water regime restoration, whereas CH4 production in soils should increase. However, we cannot derive any clear conclusions about CH4 emissions from the ecosystems based on this study, as they depend strongly on environmental factors and on the actual activity of methanotrophs in situ.

AB The inundation of boreal forests and peatlands through the construction of hydroelectric reservoirs can increase carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emission. To establish controls on emission rates, we incubated samples of forest and peat soils, spruce litter, forest litter and peatland litter collected from boreal ecosystems in northern Quebec for 16 weeks and measured CO2 and CH4 production rates under flooded or non-flooded conditions and varying oxygen concentration and temperature. CO2 production under flooded conditions was less than under non-flooded conditions (5-71 vs. 5-85 mg C g(-1) C), but CH4 production under flooded conditions was larger than under non-flooded conditions (1-8158 vs. 0-86 mu g Cg(-1) C). The average CO2 and CH4 production rate factor for flooded:non-flooded conditions was 0.76 and 132, respectively. Under flooded conditions, high oxygen concentrations increased CO2 production in peat soils but decreased CH4 production in forest and peat soils and spruce litter. Warmer temperatures (from 4 to 22 degrees C) raised both CO2 production in peat soils and peatland litter, and CH4 production in peat soils and spruce litter. This study shows that the direction and/or strength of CO2 and CH4 fluxes change once boreal forests and peatlands are inundated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the summer and autumn of 2017, anomalously high methane fluxes were measured using the chamber method on oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic mires in the southern taiga in Western Siberia (mean +/- std): up to 42.4 +/- 18.7, 10.9 +/- 6.1, and 17.9 +/- 8.1 mg C m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The winter periods of the previous 3 years (2013-2016) showed air temperatures 1.3-2.1 degrees C higher than the average over the past 13 years, which, combined with the maximum snow cover height and relatively windless weather, had led to heating of the peat layer by 3.5-5.5 degrees C in 2017. The incubation experiments, made to calculate the potential methanogenic activity, confirmed the possibility of the formation of the amount of methane in peat that is necessary to explain the results of field studies.

AB Peatlands potentially play a significant role in the global emission of three trace gases: carbon dioxide; methane; and nitrous oxide. We investigated the effect of a relatively small lowering of the water-table (10 cm) on the emission of these gases using repacked, root-free peat columns in the laboratory with peat from a nutrient-rich (eutrophic) site and a more nutrient-poor (mesotrophic) site, respectively. At a static high water-table (at the peat surface) high rates of anaerobic CO2 production were found, which were reflected in high (> 1.18) molar ratios of CO2 and CH4. A static water-table of IO cm below soil surface led to equal (eutrophic soil) or lower CO2 emission (mesotrophic soil) compared with the high static water-table. However, at a regularly changing water-table (between 0 and 10 cm below the peat surface), CO2 emission at a low water-table was 1.5 (mesotrophic soil) to 3 times (eutrophic soil) higher than at a high-water table. Maximum rates of CO2 emission from the eutrophic soil exceeded those from the mesotrophic soil, except at a static high water-table. Methane emission was about one order of magnitude lower at a low static water-table compared with the static high water-table. There was no clear effect of the nutritional status of the peat on maximum methane emission in the various water-table treatments. The nutritional status of the peat had a profound influence on the effect of water-table lowering on N2O emission: nitrous oxide emission from the eutrophic soil was strongly increased at a low water-table, whereas there was no detectable N2O emission from the mesotrophic soil. Despite a clear effect of the water-table treatments on both trace gas emissions and on redox potentials in the soil, no significant correlation between these variables was found in either soil type.

AB Climate change and associated sea level rise will likely affect coastal ecosystems and lead to more frequent inundations. Plants are an important control for methane (CH4) emissions in peatlands because the metabolism of the living plant can either enhance or attenuate CH4 emissions and plant litter supplies an easily available carbon source for methanogenesis. Here we compare the contribution of various dominant plant species to methane emissions in a degraded, rewetted coastal brackish fen at the southern Baltic Sea coast in Northeast Germany. We analyse one year of bi-weekly static closed chamber data gathered at measurement spots that were located in different mono-dominant vegetation stands (Bolboschoenus maritimus (L.) Palla, Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani (C.C.Gmel.) Palla, Carex acutiformis Ehrh.). Furthermore, data on water level, water temperature, conductivity (sulphate), and several peat characteristics were recorded. Generally, the annual methane emissions were low with an average across vegetation stands of 14 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1), which we related to high decomposition of peat after drainage and to relatively low water levels in summer. Nevertheless, methane emissions varied between different vegetation types with significantly higher methane fluxes (31.8 +/- A 5.7 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1)) from Bolboschoenus maritimus stands compared to Carex acutiformis and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani stands (4.3 +/- A 1.2 and 5.7 +/- A 2.4 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1), respectively). None of the environmental variables that have been recorded can explain this difference. Thus, vegetation composition seems to be an important driver for methane emissions in coastal brackish fens and may therefore be crucial with regard to recreation measures.

AB Fluxes and profile distribution of methane in the snow cover and different landscape elements of an oligotrophic West-Siberian bog (Mukhrino Research Station, Khanty-Mansiisk autonomous district) have been studied during a cold season. Simple models have been proposed for the description of methane distribution in the inert snow layer, which combine the transport of the gas and a source of constant intensity on the soil surface. The formation rates of stationary methane profiles in the snow cover have been estimated (characteristic time of 24 h). Theoretical equations have been derived for the calculation of small emission fluxes from bogs to the atmosphere on the basis of the stationary profile distribution parameters, the snow porosity, and the effective methane diffusion coefficient in the snow layer. The calculated values of methane emission significantly (by 2-3 to several tens of times) have exceeded the values measured under field conditions by the closed chamber method (0.008-0.25 mg C/(m(2) h)), which indicates the possibility of underestimating the contribution of the cold period to the annual emission cycle of bog methane.

AB Rewetting combined with biomass crop cultivation (paludiculture) has been proposed as a method for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from drained peatlands. This field experiment compared CO2 fluxes from drained (control) and rewetted experimental plots in a temperate fen under reed canary grass cultivation over two successive years. The annual weighted mean water table depth from soil surface (WTD) during the study period was 9, 3 and 1 cm in control, semi-flooded and flooded plots, respectively. There were no significant effects of WTD treatment on biomass yields. The choice of response model for CO2 fluxes influenced annual estimates of ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary production (GPP), but all models showed that ER and GPP decreased in response to rewetting. The resulting net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2, derived by combining eight ER and eight GPP models, varied widely. For example, NEE (expressed as CO2-C) ranged from -935 to -208 g m(-2) yr(-1) for the flooded plots. One set of ER and GPP models was selected on the basis of statistical criteria and showed insignificant differences in NEE between the three water table treatments (-537 to -341 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)). Treatment effects on CO2 emission factors, calculated as the sum of NEE and C export in harvested biomass (58-242 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)), were similarly insignificant. Thus, the results indicated that varying WTD within this narrow range could influence both ER and GPP without altering the net emissions of CO2.

AB The effect of flooding on methane (CH4) fluxes was studied through the construction of an experimental reservoir in a boreal forest wetland at the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario. Prior to flooding, the peatland surface was a small source of CH4 to the atmosphere (1.0 +/- SD of 2.3 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). After flooding, CH4 fluxes from the submerged peat surface increased to 64 +/- 68 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). CH4 bubbles within the submerged peat caused about 1/3 of the peat to float. Fluxes from these floating peat islands were much higher (440 +/- 350 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) than from both the pre-flood (undisturbed) and the post-flood (submerged) peat surfaces.
   The high fluxes of CH4 from the floating peat surfaces may be explained by a number of factors known to affect the production and consumption of CH4 in peat. In floating peat, however, these factors are particularly enhanced and include decreased oxidation of CH4 due to the loss of aerobic habitat normally found above the water table of undisturbed peat and to increased peat temperatures. The extremely high fluxes associated with newly lifted peat may decrease as the islands age. However, CH4 flux rates from floating peat islands that were several years old still far exceeded those from undisturbed peat surfaces and from the water surface of a newly created reservoir.

AB Peatlands on the Tibetan Plateau play crucial roles in regional carbon cycling but faced serious degradation in recent decades, and hydrological restoration is being conducted to regain their ecosystem function. However, how restoration affects the environmental controls on carbon processes of these unique ecosystems remains unclear, and the role of vegetation community in regulating carbon processes in response to the restoration is unknown. A long dam was built at the outlet of a large shallow lake on the plateau in order to evaluate the effects of hydrological restoration on the carbon sequestration of the world's largest alpine peatlands. The carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes from three widely distributed peatland communities, i.e., Kobresia pusilla, Carex enervis, and Carex rnuliensis commuities, were investigated immediately before and after restoration. The water table rising as a consequence of restoration, at least temporarily, decreased the carbon consumption rate (plant respiration plus soil decomposition) for each unit of carbon fixation by plants, which is community dependent. However, a positive relationship between temperature sensitivity of ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and optimal water table for respiration implies a positive feedback between water table rising and warming on R-eco. Meanwhile, the dominant factor explaining the variance of R-eco shifted from soil temperature (explained 56%) to water table (explained 68%) after restoration. Water table rising enhanced the CH4 emissions by 3-12 times, with significantly different changes in CH4 flux over a standard variation in water table level among the communities. Temperature was excluded while only water table and vegetation type were included in the model to predict CH4 fluxes after restoration in contrast to before. We argue that the shift of driving environmental factors and the role of vegetation community are essential in evaluating the effects of hydrological restoration on carbon cycling of Plateau peatlands, particularly during the transitional period.

AB Carbon gases with younger C-14 ages than those of the surrounding peat have been reported from continental boreal peatlands, a fact which suggests that significant movement of CO2, CH4, or DOC (dissolved organic carbon) and export of C via subsurface processes are not accounted for in most estimates of contributions to the C cycle. This paper tests the hypothesis that similar processes can occur in oceanic ombrotrophic mires where water and gas movement is theoretically minimal. Measurements of C-14 and delta(13)C in CO2, CH4, and DOC, and of tritium, are reported from depths to 250 cm at Tor Royal, a raised mire in southwest England. Radiocarbon ages of gases are 1460 to 500 yr younger than those of peat from the same depths, and CO2 is consistently younger than CH4. DOC is 1260 to 830 yr younger than the peat, and significant amounts of tritium were found at all depths, Gas ages are mostly intermediate between the age of the peat and that of the DOC, which suggests that C is principally transported as DOC. However, some gases are younger than their associated DOG, which implies that movement of dissolved gases may also take place. delta(13)C values in gases suggest that CO2 reduction is the major pathway for CH4 production. Transport of C in deep peats is likely to be a significant component in the overall C budget of ombrotrophic oceanic peatlands, and C export via discharge to ground or surface waters may be an important mechanism for gaseous C emissions.

AB Atmospheric CO2 and CH4 exchange in peatlands is controlled by water table levels and soil moisture, but impacts of short periods of dryness and rainfall are poorly known. We conducted drying-rewetting experiments with mesocosms from an ombrotrophic northern bog and an alpine, minerotrophic fen. Efflux of CO2 and CH4 was measured using static chambers and turnover and diffusion rates were calculated from depth profiles of gas concentrations. Due to a much lower macroporosity in the fen compared to the bog peat, water table fluctuated more strongly when irrigation was stopped and resumed, about 11 cm in the fen and 5 cm in the bog peat. Small changes in air filled porosity caused CO2 and CH4 concentrations in the fen peat to be insensitive to changes in water table position. CO2 emission was by a factor of 5 higher in the fen than in the bog mesocosms and changed little with water table position in both peats. This was probably caused by the importance of the uppermost, permanently unsaturated zone for auto- and heterotrophic CO2 production, and a decoupling of air filled porosity from water table position. CH4 emission was < 0.4 mmol m(-2) day(-1) in the bog peat, and up to > 12.6 mmol m(-2) day(-1) in the fen peat, where it was lowered by water table fluctuations. CH4 production was limited to the saturated zone in the bog peat but proceeded in the capillary fringe of the fen peat. Water table drawdown partly led to inhibition of methanogenesis in the newly unsaturated zone, but CH4 production appeared to continue after irrigation without time-lag. The identified effects of irrigation on soil moisture and respiration highlight the importance of peat physical properties for respiratory dynamics; but the atmospheric carbon exchange was fairly insensitive to the small-scale fluctuations induced.

AB Peatlands are recognised as an important but vulnerable ecological resource. Understanding the effects of existing damage, in this case erosion, enables more informed land management decisions to be made. Over the growing seasons of 2013 and 2014 photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration were measured using closed chamber techniques within vegetated haggs and erosional peat pans in Dartmoor National Park, southwest England. Below-ground total and heterotrophic respiration were measured and autotrophic respiration estimated from the vegetated haggs. The mean water table was significantly higher in the peat pans than in the vegetated haggs; because of this, and the switching from submerged to dry peat, there were differences in vegetation composition, photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration. In the peat pans photosynthetic CO2 uptake and ecosystem respiration were greater than in the vegetated haggs and strongly dependent on the depth to water table (r(2)>0.78, p<0.001). Whilst in the vegetated haggs, photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration had the strongest relationships with normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) (r(2)=0.82, p<0.001) and soil temperature at 15cm depth (r(2)=0.77, p=0.001). Autotrophic and total below-ground respiration in the vegetated haggs varied with soil temperature; heterotrophic respiration increased as water tables fell. An empirically derived net ecosystem model estimated that over the two growing seasons both the vegetated haggs (29 and 20gCm(-2); 95% confidence intervals of -570 to 762 and -873 to 1105 gCm(-2)) and the peat pans (7 and 8gCm(-2); 95% confidence intervals of -147 to 465 and -136 to 436gCm(-2)) were most likely net CO2 sources. This study suggests that not only the visibly degraded bare peat pans but also the surrounding vegetated haggs are losing carbon to the atmosphere, particularly during warmer and drier conditions, highlighting a need for ecohydrological restoration.

AB [1] Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes in a palsa mire characterized by dry (palsa) and wet surfaces in a subarctic zone in Finland were measured using a static chamber technique during two climatically different years, 1998 and 1999. Each of the 24 collars was individually studied for water table level, peat temperature, pH, vegetation, frost depth, CO2 exchange and CH4 fluxes. The annual gaseous carbon balance varied from -36.9 g C m(-2) to -138.6 g C m(-2) (uptake) on wet surfaces. During both years, palsa surfaces with shrub vegetation were sinks for carbon, whereas palsa surfaces with sparse vegetation lost carbon to the atmosphere. In 1999, a wet year, a lower NEE resulted mainly from a decrease in photosynthesis. The annual emissions of CH4 ranged from 1.0 g CH4-C m(-2) in the palsa to 24.7 g CH4-C m(-2) at the palsa margin. On wet surfaces, photosynthesis, respiration and CH4 fluxes were tightly linked. Annual NEE and CH4 fluxes were close to the values reported for boreal peatlands (fens).

AB CO2 and CH4 exchange are strongly affected by hydrology in landscapes underlain by permafrost. Hypotheses for these effects in the model ecosys were tested by comparing modeled CO2 and CH4 exchange with CO2 fluxes measured by eddy covariance from 2006 to 2009, and with CH4 fluxes measured with surface chambers in 2008, along a topographic gradient at Daring Lake, NWT. In an upland tundra, rises in net CO2 uptake in warmer years were constrained by declines in CO2 influxes when vapor pressure deficits (D) exceeded 1.5kPa and by rises in CO2 effluxes with greater active layer depth. Consequently, net CO2 uptake rose little with warming. In a lowland fen, CO2 influxes declined less with D and CO2 effluxes rose less with warming, so that rises in net CO2 uptake were greater than those in the tundra. Greater declines in CO2 influxes with warming in the tundra were modeled from greater soil-plant-atmosphere water potential gradients that developed under higher D in drained upland soil, and smaller rises in CO2 effluxes with warming in the fen were modeled from O-2 constraints to heterotrophic and belowground autotrophic respiration from a shallow water table in poorly drained lowland soil. CH4 exchange modeled during July and August indicated very small influxes in the tundra and larger effluxes characterized by afternoon emission events caused by degassing of warming soil in the fen. Emissions of CH4 modeled from degassing during soil freezing in October-November contributed about one third of the annual total.

AB Background: Peatlands are an important component of Canada's landscape, however there is little information on their national-scale net emissions of carbon dioxide [Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE)] and methane (CH4). This study compiled results for peatland NEE and CH4 emissions from chamber and eddy covariance studies across Canada. The data were summarized by bog, poor fen and rich-intermediate fen categories for the seven major peatland containing terrestrial ecozones (Atlantic Maritime, Mixedwood Plains, Boreal Shield, Boreal Plains, Hudson Plains, Taiga Shield, Taiga Plains) that comprise > 96% of all peatlands nationally. Reports of multiple years of data from a single site were averaged and different microforms (e.g., hummock or hollow) within these peatland types were kept separate. A new peatlands map was created from forest composition and structure information that distinguishes bog from rich and poor fen. National Forest Inventory k-NN forest structure maps, bioclimatic variables (mean diurnal range and seasonality of temperatures) and ground surface slope were used to construct the new map. The Earth Observation for Sustainable Development map of wetlands was used to identify open peatlands with minor tree cover.
   Results: The new map was combined with averages of observed NEE and CH4 emissions to estimate a growing season integrated NEE (+/- SE) at - 108.8 (+/- 41.3) Mt CO2 season(-1) and CH4 emission at 4.1 (+/- 1.5) Mt CH4 season(-1) for the seven ecozones. Converting CH4 to CO2 equivalent (CO2 e; Global Warming Potential of 25 over 100 years) resulted in a total net sink of - 7.0 (+/- 77.6) Mt CO2 e season(-1) for Canada. Boreal Plains peatlands contributed most to the NEE sink due to high CO2 uptake rates and large peatland areas, while Boreal Shield peatlands contributed most to CH4 emissions due to moderate emission rates and large peatland areas. Assuming a winter CO2 emission of 0.9 g CO2 M-2 day(-1) creates an annual CO2 source (24.2 Mt CO2 year(-1) ) and assuming a winter CH4 emission of 7 mg CH4 M-2 day(-1) inflates the total net source to 151.8 Mt CO2 e year(-1).
   Conclusions: This analysis improves upon previous basic, aspatial estimates and discusses the potential sources of the high uncertainty in spatially integrated fluxes, indicating a need for continued monitoring and refined maps of peatland distribution for national carbon and greenhouse gas flux estimation.

AB CO2 and CH4 fluxes during the winter were measured at natural and drained bog and fen sites in eastern Finland using both the dosed chamber method and calculations of gets diffusion along a concentration gradient through the snowpack. The snow diffusion results were compared with those obtained by chamber, but the winter flux estimates were derived from chamber data only. CH4 emissions from a poor bog were lower than those from an oligotrophic fen, while both CO2 and CH4 fluxes were higher in the Carer rostrata-occupied marginal (lagg) area of the fen than in the slightly less fertile centre. Average estimated winter CO2-C losses from virgin and drained forested peatlands were 41 and 68 g CO2-C m(-2) respectively, accounting for 23 and 21% of the annual total CO2 release from the peat. The mean release of CH4-C was 1.0 g in natural bogs and 3.4 g m-2 in fens, giving rise to winter emissions averaging to 22% of the annual emission from the bogs and 10% of that from the fens. These wintertime carbon gas losses in Finnish natural peatlands were even greater than reported average long-term annual C accumulation values (less than 25 g C m(-2)) The narrow range of 10-30% of the proportion of winter CO2 and CH4 emissions from annual emissions found in Finnish peatlands suggest that a wider generalization in the boreal zone is possible. Drained forested bogs emitted 0.3 g CH2-C m(-2) on the average, while the effectively drained fens consumed an average of 0.01 g CH4-C m(-2). Reason for the low CH4 efflux or net oxidation in drained peatlands probably lies in low substrate supply and thus low CH4 production in the anoxic deep peat layers. N2O release from a fertilized grassland site in November-May was 0.7 g N2O m(-2), accounting for 38% of the total annual emission, while a forested bog released none and two efficiently drained forested fens 0.09 (28% of annual release) and 0.04 g N2O m(-2) (27%) during the winter, respectively.

AB Net ecosystem exchange of carbon was measured using eddy covariance for four growing seasons at a subarctic hummocky fen in northern Manitoba, Canada. Over a 115 day measurement period each year, cumulative net ecosystem exchange of carbon ranged from a gain of 49 g C m(-2) to a loss of 16 g C m(-2) with a mean loss of 6gCm(-2) from the fen,with an uncertainty of about +/- 34 g C m(-2). Ecosystem respiration decreased with higher water tables (r(2) = 0.3), especially in one summer when flooding occurred to 0.12 m above the peat surface. Additional methane emissions previously documented for the site of 4-5.7 g C m(-2)year(-1) added to the carbon loss. Carbon loss was measured from this same fen in the 1990s and it is likely that the carbon gain (peat accumulation) during past centuries has not continued in recent decades. Scaling to annual greenhouse gas emissions as a 100 year global warming potential showed that this fen is currently a source of 192-490 g CO2-equivalents m(-2) year based on both carbon dioxide and methane flux measurements, indicating that peat is decomposing.

AB Peatlands are long term carbon catchments that sink atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and source methane (CH4). in the uplands of the United Kingdom ombrotrophic blanket peatlands commonly exist within Calluna vulgaris (L.) dominated moorland ecosystems. These landscapes contain a range of topographical features that influence local hydrology, climate and plant community composition. In this study we examined the variation in ecosystem CO2 respiration and net CH4 fluxes from typical plant-soil systems in dendritic drainage gullies and adjacent blanket peat during the growing season. Typically, Eriophorum spp., Sphagnum spp. and mixed grasses occupied gullies while C. uulgaris dominated in adjacent blanket peat. Gross CO2 respiration was highest in the areas of Eriophorum spp. (650 +/- 140 Mg CO2 m(-2)h(-1)) compared to those with Sphagnum spp. (338 +/- 49 mg CO2 m(-2)h(-1)), mixed grasses (342 +/- 91 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)) and C. vulgaris (174 +/- 63 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)). Measurements of the net CH4 flux showed higher fluxes from the Eriophorum spp (2.2 +/- 0.6 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) locations compared to the Sphagnurn spp. (0.6 +/- 0.4 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)), mixed grasses (0.1 +/- 0.1 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) and a negligible flux detected from C. uulgaris (0.0 +/- 0.0 mg CH4 m(-2)h(-1)) locations. A GIS approachwas applied to calculate the contribution of gullies to landscape scale greenhouse gas fluxes. Findings from the Moor House National Nature Reserve in the UK showed that although gullies occupied only 9.3% of the total land surface, gullies accounted for 95.8% and 21.6% of the peatland net CH4 and CO2 respiratory fluxes, respectively. The implication of these findings is that the relative contribution of characteristic gully systems need to be considered in estimates of landscape scale peatland greenhouse gas fluxes.

AB Bog ecosystems are sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance, including drainage and air pollution. Carbon (C) balance measurements to determine the effect of disturbance on bog functioning are laborious; therefore reliable proxies for C fluxes that could facilitate upscaling from single studies to a larger scale would be valuable. We measured peat CO2 emissions (R (s)), CH4 efflux and vegetation characteristics in four bog areas that formed a gradient from pristine to severely disturbed peatlands, affected by drainage, peat mining, alkaline air pollution and underground oil-shale mining. We expected that sites experiencing higher human impact (i.e., the vegetation was more distinct from that of a natural bog) would have higher R (s) and lower CH4 emissions, but differences in peat C emissions between the most disturbed and pristine sites were not significant. Growing period median R (s) ranged from 0.5 to 2.2 g C m(-2) day(-1) for our plots; methane emissions, measured from July to December were an order of magnitude lower, ranging from -5.9 to 126.7 mg C m(-2) day(-1). R (s) and CH4 emissions were primarily determined by water table depth, as was tree stand productivity. Therefore, stand structural parameters could potentially be good indicators of soil C emissions from poorly drained forested bogs.

AB We present a one-dimensional physicochemical model of the processes leading to methane emission from peatland. The model simulates short-term responses of the methane-emitting system. Biological transformations (respiration, methanogenesis and oxidation of methane) follow modified Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with reaction potentials based on simplified representations of measured data. Root transport properties are similarly schematised. The model simulates measured responses to temperature, water table and inhibitor deposition (acid rain) quite well. Methane emission occurs overwhelmingly through the plant-introducing root transport into the model system typically converts a net sink into a source. Simulations performed using the model highlight the need for caution when extrapolating apparent activation energies or Q(10) factors based on short-term laboratory-based incubations to larger areas and longer time scales. They suggest that short-term temperature response is proportional to baseline activity and, other things being equal, that increasing total root transport capacity above a very low minimum is likely to result in a net decrease in methane flux.

AB 1 CO2 emissions in boreal peatlands were measured during two seasons on various mire site types representing different nutrient statuses and water tables. In order to examine the long term effects of water table draw-down on the CO2 fluxes, the sites also included 25-50-year-old drainages.
   2 On virgin sites the lowest CO2 fluxes were measured at ombrotrophic sites dominated by Sphagnum fuscum (78-127 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) at 12 degrees C, 60-200 g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1)) and the highest CO2 fluxes were at ombrotrophic sites with abundant understorey vegetation (183-259 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) at 12 degrees C, 290-340 g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1)).
   3 Lowering of the water table by 1 cm increased CO2 fluxes by an average of 7.1 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) at 12 degrees C and 9.5g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1). In some cases the effect of ditches on the water table, and correspondingly on CO2 fluxes, was small. However, effective draining caused approximate to 100% increase in CO2 fluxes. Drainages had higher CO2 fluxes compared with virgin subsites at the same temperature and water table.
   4 The effect of temperature on CO2 fluxes depended on the water table, the average Q(10) value being 2.9 with water tables of 0-20 cm and 2.0 with water tables below 20 cm.
   5 CO2 fluxes are compared with primary production figures, and peat carbon stores and the carbon balance in changing climate are discussed.

AB Peatlands are globally significant sources of atmospheric methane (CH4). While several studies have examined the effects of nutrient addition on CH4 dynamics, there are few long-term peatland fertilization experiments, which are needed to understand the aggregated effects of nutrient deposition on ecosystem functioning. We investigated responses of CH4 flux and production to long-term field treatments with three levels of N (1.6-6.4 g m(-2) yr(-1) as NH4NO3), potassium and phosphorus (PK, 5.0 g P and 6.3 g K m(-2) yr(-1) as KH2PO4), and NPK in a temperate bog. Methane fluxes were measured in the field from May to August in 2005 and 2015. In 2015 CH4 flux was higher in the NPK treatment with 16 years of 6.4 g N m(-2) yr(-1) than in the control (50.5 vs. 8.6 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). The increase in CH4 flux was associated with wetter conditions derived from peat subsidence. Incubation of peat samples, with and without short-term PK amendment, showed that potential CH4 production was enhanced in the PK treatments, both from field application and by amending the incubation. We suggest that changes in this bog ecosystem originate from long-term vegetation change, increased decomposition and direct nutrient effects on microbial dynamics.

AB We estimated the global warming potential of Estonian peatlands (transitional fens and ombrotrophic bogs) based on greenhouse gases (GHG) CO2, CH4, and N2O and carbon (C) accrual in biomass, and the effects of drainage on these processes. Data were derived from a review of the literature of boreal peatlands. Areal estimates of peatland types were Multiplied with the values of the interquartile range of literature-derived GHG fluxes. The effect of drainage and radiative forcing of Estonian peatlands were also evaluated. Annual emission Of CO2, CH4, and N2O is estimated to be 278 to 1,056 x 10(3) Of CO2 equivalent (eq), of which CO2 makes up 22 to 44%, CH4 53 to 73%, and N2O 3 to 5%. The annual efflux is 419 to 676 x 10(3) CO2 eq year(-1) from drained peatlands, and - 141 to 380 x 10(3) CO2 eq year(-1) from the undrained peatlands. The annual loss of C from peatlands is estimated to be 38 to 86 tons C x 10(3) year(-1). Thus due to drainage, Estonia's transitional fens and ombrotrophic bogs have gone from being sinks to sources of C.

AB There are fears that global warming will lead to degradation of peatlands, higher emissions of greenhouse gases from peat, and accelerated warming. Anaerobic decomposition of organic soils produces methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas. Two peat bogs differing in mean annual temperature, Velke Darko (VD, Czech Republic, 7.2 A degrees C), and Stor myran (SA, Sweden, 4.0 A degrees C), were selected for a comparative study of how organic soils in different climatic zones will respond to warmer and drier conditions. Twenty peat cores from each bog were incubated in growth chambers. Under present-day summer conditions, VD produced 14 times more CH4 than SA. Two different warming scenarios were used. Peat-core replicates were kept at temperatures of 11 versus 16 A degrees C, and 11 versus 22 A degrees C. From 11 to 16 A degrees C, the CH4 production slightly decreased at SA, and slightly increased at VD. From 11 to 22 A degrees C, the CH4 production increased 9 times at SA, but slightly decreased at VD. After an 8-month incubation, peat cores under drying conditions (water table at -14 cm) were compared to samples with original water table (-2 cm). Drying conditions led to a steeper reduction in CH4 production at VD, compared to SA. The CH4 production decreased more than 100 times at VD. Then, the combined effect of simultaneous warming and drying at 11 and 22 A degrees C was studied. We did not find any significant effect of interactions between increasing temperature and decreasing water table level. Overall, the warmer site VD responded more strongly to the simulated climate change than the colder site SA.

AB Methods used to estimate the CO2 emission from soil commonly measure the total CO2 flux. To be able to quantify the net CO2 emission from cultivated peat soils there is a need to distinguish between soil organic matter-derived CO2 respiration and plant-derived respiration. In this investigation we used the root exclusion method to separate the plant-derived respiration from total CO2 emission. The plant-derived contribution was estimated to be between 27 and 63% of total CO2 emission depending on soil type and season. We also found a relationship between soil temperature, biomass growth and CO2 efflux, which can be used to estimate plant-derived respiration. Due to the priming effect the root exclusion method is less reliable late in the season.

AB We estimate the intensity of Late-glacial and Holocene methane emissions from peatlands based on their paleo net primary production (PNPP). The PNPP is derived from the carbon accumulation rates of the studied bog profile (Etang de la Gruere, Switzerland), which are corrected for the degree of peat degradation. The obtained PNPP curve is taken as a proxy for methane emissions. It shows relatively high values (90 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) early in the Bolling/Allerod and drops to low values (40 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) during the Younger Dryas cold period. With the onset of the Holocene the PNPP increases strongly up to 150 g C m(-2) yr(-1) around ca. 10,000 Cal. yr Bp. This is followed by a decline to minimum values (30 to 40 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) between 6500 and 4000 Cal. yr Bp. Thereafter, the PNPP starts to increase again to reach its highest value (175 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) around 1000 Cal. yr B.P.
   The PNPP curve correlates well with the evolution of the atmospheric methane concentrations as derived from Greenland ice-cores. For example, minima in atmospheric methane reported during the Younger Dryas and around 5200 Cal. yr BP are coinciding with the lowest values of PNPP and the negative atmospheric methane peak at 8200 Cal. yr BP corresponds to a marked decrease in PNPP.
   Our PNPP curve suggests that the methane emissions from northern peatlands evolved similar to those of low latitude wetlands and together they largely determined the evolution of atmospheric methane throughout the Late-glacial and the Holocene. The abruptness of the rise of atmospheric methane at the end of the Younger Dryas probably points to an additional source (e.g. marine gas hydrates), but very early in the Holocene the peatlands have likely become the dominant source of atmospheric methane.

AB Northern peatlands store a large amount of carbon and play a significant role in the global carbon cycle. Owing to the presence of waterlogged and anaerobic conditions, peatlands are typically a source of methane (CH4), a very potent greenhouse gas. This paper reviews the key mechanisms of peatland CH4 production, consumption and transport and the major environmental and biotic controls on peatland CH4 emissions. The advantages and disadvantages of micrometeorological and chamber methods in measuring CH4 fluxes from northern peatlands are also discussed. The magnitude of CH4 flux varies considerably among peatland types (bogs and fens) and microtopographic locations (hummocks and hollows). Some anthropogenic activities including forestry, peat harvesting and industrial emission of sulphur dioxide can cause a reduction in CH4 release from northern peatlands. Further research should be conducted to investigate the influence of plant growth forms on CH4 flux from northern peatlands, determine the water table threshold at which plant production in peatlands enhances CH4 release, and quantify peatland CH4 exchange at plant community level with a higher temporal resolution using automatic chambers.

AB Atmospheric gradient techniques were used to measure the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 for a subarctic sedge fen near Churchill, Manitoba, during the summer of 1994. This was the second driest and warmest summer since 1943. The mean daily temperature was 2 degrees C above average, and the rainfall was 55% below normal. More than half of the rain fell after the main growth period. The fen landscape comprises hummocks and hollows. Equilibrium retention storage occurs at an average standing water depth of 80 mm above the hollow bottoms (water table reference is 0). During the summer of 1994 the average water table position at -117 mm resided well below the zero equilibrium retention depth. Periodically this decreased to -265 mm, well below a 30-year average depth of -70 mm. During the full summer period, measurements indicate that the fen was a source of CO2. Only during a relatively short period of most active photosynthesis in midseason was there a small net CO2 uptake. A deep and warm soil aerobic layer promoted a large respiration flux, and this exceeded the photosynthetic CO2 uptake of the stressed sedge community. Diurnally changes in surface temperatures and incident solar radiation can explain most of the changes in the net CO2 exchange. It is hypothesized that in 1994 photosynthesis was significantly decreased and the respiration loss enhanced by the hot, dry conditions. If this hypothesis is correct, by analogy climate warming would need to be accompanied by a substantial rainfall increase to maintain a condition of net CO2 gain to this peatland.

AB Climate change is expected to have significant and uncertain impacts on methane (CH4) emissions from northern peatlands. Biogeochemical models can extrapolate site-specificCH(4) measurements to larger scales and predict responses of CH4 emissions to environmental changes. However, these models include considerable uncertainties and limitations in representing CH4 production, consumption, and transport processes. To improve predictions of CH4 transformations, we incorporated acetate and stable carbon (C) isotopic dynamics associated with CH4 cycling into a biogeochemistry model, DNDC. By including these new features, DNDC explicitly simulates acetate dynamics and the relative contribution of acetotrophic and hydro-genotrophic methanogenesis (AM and HM) to CH4 production, and predicts the C isotopic signature (delta C-13) in soil C pools and emitted gases. When tested against biogeochemical and microbial community observations at two sites in a zone of thawing permafrost in a subarctic peatland in Sweden, the new formulation substantially improved agreement with CH4 production pathways and delta C-13 in emitted CH4 (delta C-13-CH4), a measure of the integrated effects of microbial production and consumption, and of physical transport. We also investigated the sensitivity of simulated delta C-13-CH4 to C isotopic composition of substrates and, to fractionation factors for CH4 production (alpha(AM) and alpha(HM)), CH4 oxidation (alpha(MO)), and plant-mediated CH4 transport (alpha(TP)). The sensitivity analysis indicated that the delta C-13-CH4 is highly sensitive to the factors associated with microbial metabolism (alpha(AM), alpha(HM), and alpha(MO)). The model framework simulating stable C isotopic dynamics provides a robust basis for better constraining and testing microbial mechanisms in predicting CH4 cycling in peatlands.

AB Controls on the fate of similar to 277 Pg of soil organic carbon (C) stored in permafrost peatland soils remain poorly understood despite the potential for a significant positive feedback to climate change. Our objective was to quantify the temperature, moisture, organic matter, and microbial controls on soil organic carbon (SOC) losses following permafrost thaw in peat soils across Alaska. We compared the carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions from peat samples collected at active layer and permafrost depths when incubated aerobically and anaerobically at -5, -0.5, +4, and +20 degrees C. Temperature had a strong, positive effect on C emissions; global warming potential (GWP) was >3x larger at 20 degrees C than at 4 degrees C. Anaerobic conditions significantly reduced CO2 emissions and GWP by 47% at 20 degrees C but did not have a significant effect at -0.5 degrees C. Net anaerobic CH4 production over 30 days was 7.1 +/- 2.8 mu g CH4-C gC(-1) at 20 degrees C. Cumulative CO2 emissions were related to organic matter chemistry and best predicted by the relative abundance of polysaccharides and proteins (R-2 = 0.81) in SOC. Carbon emissions (CO2-C + CH4-C) from the active layer depth peat ranged from 77% larger to not significantly different than permafrost depths and varied depending on the peat type and peat decomposition stage rather than thermal state. Potential SOC losses with warming depend not only on the magnitude of temperature increase and hydrology but also organic matter quality, permafrost history, and vegetation dynamics, which will ultimately determine net radiative forcing due to permafrost thaw.

AB P>Vascular wetland plants may substantially increase methane emissions by producing root exudates and easily degradable litter, and by providing a low-resistance diffusion pathway via their aerenchyma. However, model studies have indicated that vascular plants can reduce methane emission when soil oxygen demand is exceeded by oxygen released from roots. Here, we tested whether these conditions occur in bogs dominated by cushion plants.
   Root-methane interactions were studied by comparing methane emissions, stock and oxygen availability in depth profiles below lawns of either cushion plants or Sphagnum mosses in Patagonia.
   Cushion plants, Astelia pumila and Donatia fascicularis, formed extensive root systems up to 120 cm in depth. The cold soil (< 10 degrees C) and highly decomposed peat resulted in low microbial activity and oxygen consumption. In cushion plant lawns, high soil oxygen coincided with high root densities, but methane emissions were absent. In Sphagnum lawns, methane emissions were substantial. High methane concentrations were only found in soils without cushion plant roots.
   This first methane study in Patagonian bog vegetation reveals lower emissions than expected. We conclude that cushion plants are capable of reducing methane emission on an ecosystem scale by thorough soil and methane oxidation.

AB Methane emissions from an acidic bog and a forested swamp in north Wales, U. K., were measured over a 12 month period. Along with the emission, hydrochemistry (DOC, SO42- and NO3-) and physical factors (temperature, water table level) were determined. At the bog site, the methane emission ranged from 0.15 mg m(-2) day(-1) to 6.39 mg m(-2) day(-1), having two peaks in spring and late summer. In contrast, high emission was observed in October (38.95 mg m(-2) day(-1)) and November (75.37 mg m(-2) day(-1)) at the swamp site, which is concurrent with leaf litter production and high DOC concentrations. During the remaining months, the flux varied between -1.33 mg m(-2) day(-1) and 3.05 mg m(-2) day(-1). Correlation analyses showed that the methane emission from the acidic bog had a positive correlation with soil temperature, and negative correlations with sulfate and nitrate concentrations in the pore-water. However, a correlation with water table level was absent. Methane emission from the swamp exhibited a negative correlation with sulfate concentration. Our results confirm that methane emissions vary substantially between different types of wetlands, and suggest that under certain conditions, hydrochemistry may be a more critical controlling variable for methane emissions than temperature and water table level.

AB Reservoirs are sources of greenhouses gases to the atmosphere, primarily due to organic carbon mineralization in flooded plants and soils to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Floating peat islands are common in reservoirs that inundated peatlands. These islands can decompose on mass, or small pieces of peat can erode from islands to decompose in the water column or on the bottom of reservoirs. Here we used large 450 liter sealed enclosures to measure mineralization rates of small peat pieces and larger peat blocks collected from floating peat islands. Mineralization rates were calculated by quantifying dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2 and CH4 accumulation within the water and headspace of the enclosures over time. We found that peat did decompose under water, but rates of mineralization of peat pieces were not different than rates of mineralization of larger peat blocks. Mineralization rates ranged between 59 and 140 mug C g(-1) d(-1). Peat pieces acidified the water, shifting the bicarbonate equilibrium to almost exclusively dissolved CO2, which was then readily able to flux to the atmosphere. We estimated that 2.4-5.6% of peat carbon was mineralized annually, suggesting that fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from reservoirs that flood peatlands could last at minimum 18-42 years from this carbon source alone.

AB Rewetting of drained peatlands has been recommended to reduce CO2 emissions and to restore the carbon sink function of peatlands. Recently, the combination of rewetting and biomass production (paludiculture) has gained interest as a possible land use option in peatlands for obtaining such benefits of lower CO2 emissions without losing agricultural land. This study quantified the carbon balance (CO2, CH4 and harvested biomass C) of rewetted and drained peat soils under intensively managed reed canary grass (RCG) cultivation. Mesocosms were maintained at five different groundwater levels (GWLs), that is 0, 10, 20cm below the soil surface, representing rewetted peat soils, and 30 and 40cm below the soil surface, representing drained peat soils. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and CH4 emissions was measured during the growing period of RCG (May to September) using transparent and opaque closed chamber methods. The average dry biomass yield was significantly lower from rewetted peat soils (12Mgha(-1)) than drained peat soils (15Mgha(-1)). Also, CO2 fluxes of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) from rewetted peat soils were significantly lower than from drained peat soils, but net uptake of CO2 was higher from rewetted peat soils. Cumulative CH4 emissions were negligible (0.01g CH(4)m(-2)) from drained peat soils but were significantly higher (4.9g CH(4)m(-2)) from rewetted peat soils during measurement period (01 May-15 September 2013). The extrapolated annual C balance was 0.03 and 0.68kg C m(-2) from rewetted and drained peat soils, respectively, indicating that rewetting and paludiculture can reduce the loss of carbon from peatlands.

AB Worldwide, regularly recurring wildfires shape many peatland ecosystems to the extent that fire-adapted species often dominate plant communities, suggesting that wildfire is an integral part of peatland ecology rather than an anomaly. The most destructive blazes are smoldering fires that are usually initiated in periods of drought and can combust entire peatland carbon stores. However, peatland wildfires more typically occur as low-severity surface burns that arise in the dormant season when vegetation is desiccated, and soil moisture is high. In such low-severity fires, surface layers experience flash heating, but there is little loss of underlying peat to combustion. This study examines the potential importance of such processes in several peatlands that span a gradient from hemiboreal to tropical ecozones and experience a wide range of fire return intervals. We show that low-severity fires can increase the pool of stable soil carbon by thermally altering the chemistry of soil organic matter (SOM), thereby reducing rates of microbial respiration. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared, we demonstrate that low-severity fires significantly increase the degree of carbon condensation and aromatization of SOM functional groups, particularly on the surface of peat aggregates. Laboratory incubations show lower CO2 emissions from peat subjected to low-severity fire and predict lower cumulative CO2 emissions from burned peat after 1-3 years. Also, low-severity fires reduce the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of peat, indicating that these fires can inhibit microbial access to SOM. The increased stability of thermally altered SOM may allow a greater proportion of organic matter to survive vertical migration into saturated and anaerobic zones of peatlands where environmental conditions physiochemically protect carbon stores from decomposition for thousands of years. Thus, across latitudes, low-severity fire is an overlooked factor influencing carbon cycling in peatlands, which is relevant to global carbon budgets as climate change alters fire regimes worldwide.

AB Atmospheric pressure (P-atm) is known to regulate methane emissions from northern peatlands. However, recent conceptual models differ in how gas production and release occurs in shallow (defined here as less than 1 m depth) versus intermediate to deep peat soils (i.e., more than 1 m depth). We used ground penetrating radar (GPR) measurements to non-invasively estimate the vertical distribution of free-phase gas and the dependence of this distribution on atmospheric pressure in a northern peatland. Variations in the travel time of the electromagnetic wave to three interfaces in the peat column were used in conjunction with deformation rod data and a petrophysical model relating electromagnetic wave velocity to free-phase gas content to model changes in the vertical distribution of free-phase gas over time. We found a negative linear relation between changes in free-phase gas content and changes in P-atm for shallow peat soils and a positive linear relation for deeper soils. Our results suggest that (1) free-phase gas content confined in deep peat soils is larger and less variable to changes in P-atm than gas in shallow/intermediate peat soils; (2) increases in P-atm result in gas release from shallow peat soils into the atmosphere (i.e., rapid ebullition); and (3) decreases in P-atm result in upward gas movement from intermediate layers to replenish shallow layers. Our results suggest that changes in P-atm drive changes in the vertical distribution of free phase gas in peat soil and regulate methane ebullition from peat soils to the atmosphere. Our data shows a relationship between free phase gas and depth that may be due to changes in peat properties or increasing water pressure with depth.

AB There is growing interest in how the rewetting of drained peatlands can restart their carbon (C) sink function. However, there are few studies on the effect of ditch blocking on the within-ditch C balance. For a UK blanket bog we assessed how methane (CH4) emissions, net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) balance expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e) responded to ditch blocking.
   We conducted a fully replicated field trial on a blanket bog in the Upper Conwy catchment, North Wales, UK. Twelve parallel ditches, that ran approximately downslope, were investigated. Four were left open, four had peat dams installed at intervals of a few metres along their length, and four were partially infilled with peat (reprofiled) and dammed. For a period of four years after blocking, we measured peatland-atmosphere fluxes of CH4 and CO2 within the ditches.
   CH4 fluxes, NEE and overall GHG balance (expressed in terms of CO2-e) in the experimental area showed no evidence of varying systematically between the different types of ditch treatment (open, dammed, and reprofiled). In addition, there was little evidence that CH4 fluxes or CO2-e balance changed systematically with time since blocking.
   We found no evidence of consistent differences between blocking treatments in terms of CH4 emissions or overall CO2-e balance. There was high spatial and temporal variability in CO2 and CH4 fluxes within each treatment. We did not observe a post-blocking 'spike' in CH4 fluxes.

AB Northern peatlands in their natural state are sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2) but sources of methane (CH4). They are often nitrogen limited and can act as sinks for greenhouse gas (GHG) nitrous oxide (N2O). Peatlands have been used to treat wastewaters from different point sources. Continuous nutrient and pollutant load to a nutrient limited peatland ecosystem may change the microbial processes and lead to increased productivity, which together are likely to change the GHG emissions. We studied the effect of wastewater derived from metal mining on N2O and CH4 emissions on two treatment peatlands in northern boreal zone. The measured CH4 fluxes from the reference point without any wastewater load were in the range of those reported from northern pristine peatlands while emissions from treatment peatlands were greatly reduced, presumably as result of high sulfate concentration in the porewater. N2O emissions were small in the reference point, but up to 300 times higher in the treatment peatlands. Methane emissions increased with increasing total organic carbon concentration and decreased with increasing sulfate concentration in the surface water, respectively, while N2O emissions increased with increasing nitrate concentrations. The data indicate drastic changes in GHG fluxes and related biogeochemical processes in treatment peatlands as compared to the reference point.

AB Volcanic eruptions affect peatlands around the world, depositing volcanic ash (tephra) and a variety of chemicals including compounds of sulphur. These volcanic impacts may be important for many reasons, in particular sulphur deposition has been shown to suppress peatland methane flux, potentially reinforcing climatic cooling. Experiments have shown that sulphur deposition also forces changes in testate amoeba communities, potentially relating to the reduced methane flux. Large volcanic eruptions in regions with extensive peatlands are relatively rare so it is difficult to assess the extent to which volcanic eruptions affect peatland microbial communities; palaeoecological analyses across tephra layers provide a means to resolve this uncertainty. In this study, testate amoebae were analysed across multiple monoliths from a peatland in southern Alaska containing two tephras, probably representing the 1883 eruption of Augustine Volcano and a 20th Century eruption of Redoubt Volcano. Results showed relatively distinct and often statistically significant changes in testate amoeba community coincident with tephra layers which largely matched the response found in experimental studies of sulphur deposition. The results suggest volcanic impacts on peatland microbial communities which might relate to changes in methane flux. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands play an important role in emissions of the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O, which are produced during mineralization of the peat organic matter. To examine the influence of soil type (fen, bog soil) and environmental factors (temperature, groundwater level), emission of CO2, CH4 and N2O and soil temperature and groundwater level were measured weekly or biweekly in loco over a one-year period at four sites located in Ljubljana Marsh, Slovenia using the static chamber technique. The study involved two fen and two bog soils differing in organic carbon and nitrogen content, pH, bulk density, water holding capacity and groundwater level. The lowest CO2 fluxes occurred during the winter, fluxes of N2O were highest during summer and early spring (February, March) and fluxes of CH4 were highest during autumn. The temporal variation in CO2 fluxes could be explained by seasonal temperature variations, whereas CH4 and N2O fluxes could be correlated to groundwater level and soil carbon content. The experimental sites were net sources of measured greenhouse gases except for the drained bog site, which was a net sink of CH4. The mean fluxes of CO2 ranged between 139 mg m(-2) h(-1) in the undrained bog and 206 mg m(-2) h-(1) in the drained fen; mean fluxes of CH4 were between -0.04 mg m(-2) h(-1) in the drained bog and 0.05 mg m(-2) h(-1) in the drained fen; and mean fluxes of N2O were between 0.43 mg m(-2) h(-1) in the drained fen and 1.03 mg m(-2) h(-1) in the drained bog. These results indicate that the examined peatlands emit similar amounts of CO2 and CH4 to peatlands in Central and Northern Europe and significantly higher amounts of N2O. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Peatlands store vast amounts of soil carbon and are significant sources of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2) andmethane (CH4) emissions. The traditional approach in biogeochemical model simulations of peatland emissions is to simply divide the soil domain into an aerobic zone above and an anaerobic zone below the water table (WT) and then calculate CO2 and CH4 emissions based on the assumed properties of these two discrete zones. However, there are major potential drawbacks associated with the traditional WT-based approach, because aerobic or anaerobic environments are ultimately determined by oxygen (O-2) concentration rather than water content directly. Variations in O2 content above and below the WT can be large and thus may play an important role in partitioning of carbon fluxes between CO2 and CH4. In this paper, we propose an oxygen-based approach, which simulates the vertical and radial components of O-2 movement and consumption through the soil aerobic and anaerobic environments. We then use both our oxygen-based and the traditional WT-based approaches to simulate CO2 and CH4 emissions from an Alaskan fen peatland. The results of model calibration and validation suggest that our physically realistic approach (i.e., oxygen-based approach) cause less biases on the simulated flux of CO2 and CH4. The results of model simulations also suggest that the traditional WT-based approach might substantially under-estimate CH4 emissions and over-estimate CO2 emissions from the fen due to the presence of anaerobic zones in unsaturated soil. Our oxygen-based approach can be easily incorporated into existing ecosystem or earth system models but will require additional validation with more extensive field observations to be implemented within biogeochemical models to improve simulations of soil C fluxes at regional or global scale.

AB Wetland ecosystems are a major natural source of the important greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Among these ecosystems, fens have been shown to release high quantities of CH4. Data on CH4 emissions from alpine fens are scarce and mainly limited to the United States and China. Therefore, static chambers were used to quantify CH4 emissions from 14 fens located in the Swiss Alps. The aims of this study were to determine the spatial variability of the emissions and to identify potential key factors which influence CH4 turnover. The fens were located at altitudes between 1,800 and 2,600 m a.s.l., the pore water varied from acidic to slightly acidic (pH 4.5-6.4) and the vegetation was dominated by plants of the genus Carex. In addition, the underlying bedrock was either siliceous or calcareous. Methane emissions ranged from 74 +/- A 43 to 711 +/- A 212 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1). The type of bedrock, the plant biomass above the water table and the CH4 pore water concentrations at depths from 0 to 20 cm were the main factors influencing CH4 emissions. Detailed measurements in three selected fens suggested that more than 98 % of the total CH4 emissions are due to plant-mediated transport.

AB Methane emissions from sis mires in northern Sweden were measured using a closed chamber technique during the frost free season in 1992. The average methane flux over the measurement period, calculated either for each mire or for different plant communities within one mire, ranged from 9 to 83 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). The emission rate on each occasion was related to physical and chemical environmental variables, both in a general data set for all mires (n=836) and in subdata sets for individual mires, using multiple linear regression. The variables with significant contributions to the models were water table, standing water above the vegetation surface, peat temperatures, and principal components of the near infrared reflectance spectra of peat samples reflecting variations in organic chemical composition. To account for the actual contribution of methane production and methane oxidation, variables describing the active parts of the vertically distributed potentials of methane production or oxidation were constructed. The interaction terms between these variables, respectively, describing the active proportion of methanogens and methanotrophs, and the temperature values representing the anoxic and oxic parts of the profile were significantly correlated to the methane emission rate; positively for the production zone and negatively for the consumption zone. By using this mechanistic approach, a significant temperature effect in both the methane production and consumption zone was detected. These constructed temperature variables explain 21% of the variance in the logarithmically transformed methane fluxes using the entire data set (n=836) but only 5% of the variance using peat temperatures from fixed depths. Adding variables describing the organic chemical composition of the peat to the models improved the predictability in 10 of the 11 model sets tested, decreasing the unexplained variance by maximally 50% for a poor fen community model and increasing R-2 from 0.40 to 0.68. In the general model, R-2 increased from 0.42 to 0.49 with the inclusion of organic chemical composition. The explained variance in the final models, including the substrate variables, ranged from R-2=0.49 to R-2=0.75, with one exception, Torsmyran (R-2=0.36) which is a mire that most closely relates to an eccentric ombrotrophic bog among the mires studied.

AB The methane exchange in an oligotrophic mire complex was measured on the ecosystem and microform scale with the eddy covariance (EC) and the closed chamber technique, respectively. Information about the distribution of three distinct microform types in the area of interest and in each 30 min EC flux source area was derived from a high-resolution (1 m(2)) landcover map in combination with an analytical source weight model (Kormann and Meixner, 2001). The mean weighted coverage of flark, lawn and hummock microforms in the EC source area (0.3% : 57% :43%) closely mirrors the overall distribution in the area of interest (0.5% : 50.1%: 49.4%), despite great differences in microform coverage between individual 30 min EC source areas. The measured ecosystem flux was fitted to the sum of three microform flux models based on environmental variables and weighted by their fractional coverage in the EC source area. This method resulted in a better representation of the ecosystem flux compared to an approach based on only one flux model for the whole ecosystem (R-2 = 0.87, RMSE = 0.44 vs. R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 0.61, n = 5181) and thus constitutes a successful down-scaling of measured ecosystem scale flux to the microform scale. A comparison of down-scaled and measured microform fluxes reveals a good agreement for lawn microforms and systematic differences for flark and hummock microforms. Reasons for the differences are thought to be the limited resolution of the landcover classification and the systematic underestimation of hummock fluxes by the closed chamber technique. As a result, hummock fluxes derived by down-scaling of EC fluxes are considered to be more dependable than closed chamber fluxes. The seasonal ecosystem methane budget from gap-filled EC measurements was 9.4 +/- 0.2 g CH4 m(-2); the budget derived from up-scaled microform measurements was 8.0 +/- 0.8 g CH4 m(-2). The lower value of the latter budget is attributed to the underestimation of flark and hummock fluxes by closed chamber measurements and to the microform gap-filling procedure. Generally, estimates from up-scaled microform measurements are found to be less certain than estimates from EC measurements. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatland measurements of CO2 and CH4 flux were obtained at scales appropriate to the in situ biological community below the tree layer to demonstrate representativeness of the spruce and peatland responses under climatic and environmental change (SPRUCE) experiment. Surface flux measurements were made using dual open-path analyzers over an area of 1.13 m(2) in daylight and dark conditions along with associated peat temperatures, water table height, hummock moisture, atmospheric pressure and incident radiation data. Observations from August 2011 through December 2014 demonstrated seasonal trends correlated with temperature as the dominant apparent driving variable. The S1-Bog for the SPRUCE study was found to be representative of temperate peatlands in terms of CO2 and CH4 flux. Maximum net CO2 flux in midsummer showed similar rates of C uptake and loss: daytime surface uptake was -5 to -6 A mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and dark period loss rates were 4-5 A mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (positive values are carbon lost to the atmosphere). Maximum midsummer CH4-C flux ranged from 0.4 to 0.5 A mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and was a factor of 10 lower than dark CO2-C efflux rates. Midwinter conditions produced near-zero flux for both CO2 and CH4 with frozen surfaces. Integrating temperature-dependent models across annual periods showed dark CO2-C and CH4-C flux to be 894 +/- 34 and 16 +/- 2 gC m(-2) y(-1), respectively. Net ecosystem exchange of carbon from the shrub-forb-Sphagnum-microbial community (excluding tree contributions) ranged from -3.1 gCO(2)-C m(-2) y(-1) in 2013, to C losses from 21 to 65 gCO(2)-C m(-2) y(-1) for the other years.

AB Chamber method is commonly used to measure the CO2 exchange from plant communities. Due to low time resolution, actual measurements reflect only momentary CO2 exchange rates. Therefore, a common way to derive seasonal or annual estimates is to establish models describing the response of CO2 exchange to environmental variables, and then to reconstruct the CO2 exchange over the desired time period. There are several alternative ways to obtain the CO2 balance for the entire mire: models can be parameterized by individual sample plots, plant communities or the entire site. Similarly, the CO2 balance can be reconstructed by plots, plant communities or the entire site. We tested how the choice of the modelling and reconstruction approach influences the CO2 exchange estimates for the entire mire and for individual sample plots and plant communities. We measured the CO2 exchange in a spatially heterogeneous sedge-dominated northern aapa mire for two growing seasons. We observed high spatial variation in CO2 balance between the plant communities. We noticed that when the CO2 balances of individual sample plots or plant communities are of interest, using a model appropriate for the entire site may result in biased estimates. In worst case the different modelling approaches may turn the CO2 balance of an individual sample plot from positive to negative. Further, while using the whole ecosystem approach in modelling, the superior ability of chamber method in acknowledging spatial variation is lost. While the modelled growing season CO2 balance of the mire ranged from 232 to 625 g CO2 m(-2) depending on the chosen modelling and reconstruction approach, the average estimates still remained within the uncertainty range of one another. Acknowledgement of the spatial variation in plant community level makes the areal estimate more robust to varying weather conditions. Further, the reliability of estimates is improved by explicit formulation of the choices behind the modelling and reconstruction units reflecting the study objectives. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Northern peatlands are important sources of carbon dioxide and methane emissions to the atmosphere. Increased atmospheric N deposition may have a significant impact on the emission of these greenhouse gases. We studied CO2 and CH4 emissions from untreated temperate pc at soils from a eutrophic and a mesotrophic Fen in a high N deposition area (the Netherlands) and from a mesotrophic fen in a low N deposition area (north-cast Poland). In addition, we investigated the effects of N, P and glucose amendments on the emissions of CO2 and CH4 from these soils.
   Nitrogen availability (extractable NH4+) in untreated pent from the high N area was 2.5-7.5 times higher than in the low N area, whereas the pH was 0.9-1.7 units lower. Using 6-week laboratory incubations of peat columns, we found that mean daily CO2 emission from untreated peat soils from the high N area was lower than that from the low N area. Both linear and multiple regression analysis shelved that CO2 emission was positively related to soil pH (r(2) = 0.64). Additional N supply led to pn reduction and to lower CO2 emission, especially in the low N peat soils. Thus, increased atmospheric N deposition lends, probably as a result of soil acidification, to fewer CO2 emission. Although glucose amendments resulted in increased CO2 and CH4 emission, we did not find evidence that this was caused by increased mineralization of native pest. Mean daily CH4-C emission was about 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than mean daily CO2-C emission. In the untreated peat soils from the high N eutrophic site, methane emission was higher than in the high N mesotrophic site and in the low N mesotrophic site. Linear regression analysis showed a positive relation between methane emission and soil fertility variables (r(2)=0.41-0.55), whereas a multiple regression model revealed that methane emission was determined by N-related soil chemistry variables (r(2) = 0.93). Increased nutrient supply initially resulted in higher methane emission from soils of both mesotrophic sites, but there was no effect on the high N eutrophic soil. These results show that increased atmospheric N deposition leads to increased methane emission from low-fertility pent soils. However, the ultimate effect of atmospheric N deposition on trace gas emissions and thereby on global warming is determined by the balance between the ratios of the change in CO2-C emission and CH4-C emission and the ratio of their global warming potentials (1:21).

AB The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) is the largest peatland complex in North America. More than 75% of the HBL occurs in Ontario, where the provincial government mandates that ecosystem carbon storage and sequestration be considered in land-use planning. Accomplishing this task requires identifying carbon indicators and assessing their responses to changing ecosystem processes, such as succession, permafrost thaw, and evapotranspiration (ET). Therefore, we synthesized information on peat carbon indicators and ecosystem process from the literature. Findings indicate that the long-term carbon accumulation, carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration, peat depth, and peatland age were similar (p > 0.10) between dry and wet peatland features. Furthermore, CO2 sequestration displayed the highest variability and ponds were net CO2 emitters. Recent carbon accumulation, CH4 emission, and ET were highest (p < 0.01) in wet features, with CH4 emission displaying wide variation. Increased active layer thickness (105 +/- 92 cm per 100 years) in permafrost was the most variable ecosystem process analyzed in this study, while variation in permafrost loss (53 +/- 23% per 100 years) was similar to that of carbon accumulation and ET rates. Processes creating wet and pond conditions may increase landscape-scale CO2 and CH4 emissions to the atmosphere, weakening peatland carbon sinks. Dry conditions may reduce CH4 emissions but potentially increase peatland susceptibility to fire. Knowledge of these changes should be useful for climate change vulnerability and adaptation assessments for large landscapes. However, better understanding of variability in CO2 sequestration, CH4 emission, and permafrost dynamics is required to design such assessments for small landscapes.

AB Peatland is an important terrestrial carbon reservoir that contains >25% of soil carbon and accounts for 25%-38% of natural methane emissions. Most of this carbon is contained in postglacial boreal peat. Our understanding of the carbon cycle within this reservoir and its links to the atmosphere is therefore restricted to periods of <10 k.y. A record of the longer-term behavior of the peatland carbon reservoir under nonglacial conditions does, however, exist in thick lignite deposits formed over periods of >1 m.y. Spectral analysis of varying lignite color reveals that 120 m of early Miocene lignite from the Gippsland Basin, Australia, contains a 1.7 m.y. record of orbitally paced climate oscillations dominated by the response to obliquity. Use of the regular orbital signal indicates that the average long-term rate of peatland carbon accumulation recorded in the lignite is 27.5 g.m(-2.)yr(-1). This rate is constant over periods of >100 k.y. and is independent of shorter-term, <10 k.y., fluctuations in climate and hydrology. Matching the lignite record to the theoretical insolation curve indicates that the lignite formed between 22.5 and 20.8 Ma. Contemporaneous long-term changes in lignite color and the C-13/C-12 ratios of marine foraminifera may relate to changing peatland methane flux and thus point to a link between terrestrial and marine carbon dynamics.

AB About a fifth of the global wetland methane emissions originate from boreal peatlands, which represent an important land cover type in boreal landscapes in the sporadic permafrost zone. There, rising air temperatures could lead to warmer spring and longer growing seasons, changing landscape methane emissions. To quantify the effect of warmer spring conditions on methane emissions of a boreal peat landscape in the sporadic permafrost zone of northwestern Canada, we analyzed four years (2013-2016) of methane fluxes measured with the eddy covariance technique and long-term (1951-2016) meteorological observations from a nearby climate station. In May, after snowmelt was complete, mean air temperatures were more than 2 degrees C warmer in 2013, 2015, and 2016 than in 2014. Mean growing season (May-August) air temperatures, in contrast, differed by less than 1 degrees C over the four years. WarmerMay air temperatures caused earlier wetland soil warming, with temperatures rising from similar to 0 degrees C to > 12 degrees C 25 to 40 days earlier and leading to similar to 6 degrees C warmer mean soil temperatures between May and June. However, from July to August, soil temperatures were similar among years. Mean May to August and annual methane emissions (6.4 g CH4 m(-2) and 9.4 g CH4 m(-2), respectively) of years with warmer spring (i.e. May) temperatures exceeded emissions during the cooler year by 20%-30% (4.5 g CH4 m(-2) and 7.2 g CH4 m(-2), respectively). Among years with warmer springs, growing season methane emissions varied little (+/- 0.5 g CH4 m(-2)). The observed interannual differences are most likely caused by a strong soil temperature control on methane fluxes and large soil temperature differences during the spring. Thus, in a warming climate, methane emissions from waterlogged boreal peat landscapes at the southern limit of permafrost are likely to increase in response to more frequent occurrences of warm springs.

AB We investigated the effect of sample size and sampling duration on methane bubble flux (ebullition) estimates from peat using a computer model. A field scale (10 m), seasonal (>100 days) simulation of ebullition from a two-dimensional (2-D) structurally varying peat profile was modeled at fine spatial resolution (1 mm x 1 mm). The spatial and temporal scale of this simulation was possible because of the computational efficiency of the reduced-complexity approach that was implemented, and patterns of simulated ebullition were consistent with those found in the field and laboratory. The simulated ebullition from the peat profile suggested that decreases in peat porositywhich cause increases in gas storageproduce ebullition that becomes increasingly patchy in space and erratic in time. By applying different amounts of spatial and temporal sampling effort, it was possible to determine the uncertainty in ebullition estimates from the peatland. The results suggest that traditional methods to measure ebullition can equally overestimate and underestimate flux by 20% and large ebullition events can lead to large overestimations of flux when sampling effort is low. Our findings support those of field studies, and we recommend that ebullition should be measured frequently (hourly to daily) and at many locations (n>14).

AB Peatland drainage is an important driver of global soil carbon loss and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Restoration of peatlands by reflooding reverses CO2 losses at the cost of increased methane (CH4) emissions, presenting a biogeochemical compromise. While restoring peatlands is a potentially effective method for sequestering carbon, the terms of this compromise are not well constrained. Here we present 14 site years of continuous CH4 and CO2 ecosystem-scale gas exchange over a network of restored freshwater wetlands in California, where long growing seasons, warm weather, and managed water tables result in some of the largest wetland ecosystem CH4 emissions recorded. These large CH4 emissions cause the wetlands to be strong greenhouse gas sources while sequestering carbon and building peat soil. The terms of this biogeochemical compromise, dictated by the ratio between carbon sequestration and CH4 emission, vary considerably across small spatial scales, despite nearly identical wetland climate, hydrology, and plant community compositions.
   Plain Language Summary Wetlands play an important role in the climate system, with restoration commonly undertaken for the benefit of atmospheric carbon dioxide removal and carbon storage in the soil. While flooded conditions suppress carbon dioxide emissions from decomposition and sequester carbon, they also generate methane, another potent heat-trapping greenhouse gas. Understanding the balance between these exchanges is important to our understanding of how restored or created wetlands will contribute to mitigating climate change. Here we present a long-term record of continuous carbon dioxide and methane exchange from restored wetlands in Northern California to understand the ultimate climate impact of wetland restoration.

AB The effect of elevated UV-B radiation on CO2 exchange of a natural flark fen was studied in open-field conditions during 2003-2005. The experimental site was located in SodankylA in northern Finland (67 degrees 22'N, 26 degrees 38'E, 179 m a.s.l.). Altogether 30 study plots, each 120 cm x 120 cm in size, were randomly distributed between three treatments (n=10): ambient control, UV-A control and UV-B treatment. The UV-B-treated plots were exposed to elevated UV-B radiation level for three growing seasons. The instantaneous net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and dark respiration (R-TOT) were measured during the growing season using a closed chamber method. The wintertime CO2 emissions were estimated using a gradient technique by analyzing the CO2 concentration in the snow pack. In addition to the instantaneous CO2 exchange, the seasonal CO2 balances during the growing seasons were modeled using environmental data measured at the site. In general, the instantaneous NEE at light saturation was slightly higher in the UV-B treatment compared with the ambient control, but the gross photosynthesis was unaffected by the exposure. The R-TOT was significantly lower under elevated UV-B in the third study year. The modeled seasonal (June-September) CO2 balance varied between the years depending on the ground water level and temperature conditions. During the driest year, the seasonal CO2 balance was negative (net release of CO2) in the ambient control and the UV-B treatment was CO2 neutral. During the third year, the seasonal CO2 uptake was 43 +/- 36 g CO2-C m(-2) in the ambient control and 79 +/- 45 g CO2-C m(-2) in the UV-B treatment. The results suggest that the long-term exposure to high UV-B radiation levels may slightly increase the CO2 accumulation to fens resulting from a decrease in microbial activity in peat. However, it is unlikely that the predicted development of the level of UV-B radiation would significantly affect the CO2 balance of fen ecosystems in future.

AB Microcosms of a boreal peatland originating from an oligotrophic fen in Eastern Finland were fumigated under four ozone concentrations (0, 50, 100 and 150 ppb O-3) in laboratory growth chambers during two separate experiments (autumn and summer) for 4 and 6 weeks, respectively. Ozone effects on Sphagnum mosses and the fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane were evaluated. In both experiments, the three Sphagnum species studied showed only a few significant responses to ozone. In the autumn experiment, membrane permeability of S. angustifolium, measured as conductivity and magnesium leakage, was significantly higher under ozone fumigation (P = 0.005 and < 0.001, respectively), and there was a distinct dose-dependence. S. magellanicum showed no clear responses, either for membrane leakage or pigment content. There were no substantial ozone responses in the gross photosynthesis or net CO2 exchange during the 6-week-long summer experiment, but dark ecosystem respiration was transiently increased by ozone concentration of 100 ppb after 14 days of exposure (P < 0.05). Fumigation with 100 ppb of ozone, however, more than doubled (P < 0.05) methane emission from the peatland monoliths. Our results suggest that increasing tropospheric ozone concentration may cause substantial changes in the carbon gas cycling of boreal peatlands, even though these changes are not closely associated with the changes in Sphagnum vegetation.

AB Peatlands are a large potential source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. In order to investigate the effects of climate change on CH4 emission from northern ombrotrophic peatlands, a simulation model coupling water table dynamics with methane emission was developed for the Mer Bleue Bog in Ontario, Canada. The model was validated against reported values of CH4 flux from field measurements and the model outputs exhibited high sensitivity to acrotelm thickness, leaf area index, transmissivity and slope of water table. With a 2-4A degrees C temperature rise over the 4-year simulation period, the rate of CH4 release dropped significantly to under 0.1 mg m(-2) day(-1). On the other hand, mean CH4 emission increased by > 26-fold when the increase in precipitation was > 15%. When looking at the combined effects, the highest CH4 release (13.3 mg m(-2) day(-1)) was attained under the scenario of 2A degrees C temperature rise and 25% precipitation increase. Results obtained in this study highlight the importance of avoiding more extreme climate change, which would otherwise lead to enhanced methane release from peatlands and further atmospheric warming through positive feedback.

AB We studied the effect of afforestation on soil CO2 emissions in blanket peat. The study sites were as follows: two undrained blanket peatland sites, six sites which had been drained and afforested 3, 19, 23, 27, 33 and 39 years previously, and two forest sites which were clearfelled in summer 1996. Soil CO2 emissions were measured using the soda-lime method during 13 sampling campaigns throughout 1997. Each campaign consisted of two consecutive 24-h measurements. Comparison of the average annual CO2 emission revealed no clear pattern in relation to soil type and suggests that afforestation does not always lead to an increase in soil CO2 emissions. In the most recently forested site, CO2 emissions were similar to 1.7 t C ha(-1) a(-1) and drainage had failed to lower the water-table sufficiently to cause a large increase in CO2 emissions. In the 19-, 23-, 27- and 33-year-old sites soil CO2 emissions were similar to 1.0-1.4 t C ha(-1) a(-1) and were similar to, or lower than, levels in the undrained sites. In the 39-year-old site average CO2 emissions were 2.6 t C ha(-1) a(-1). In the clearfelled sites CO2 emissions were lower at between 1.4 and 1.6 t C ha(-1) a(-1). Root respiration appears to account for a large proportion of CO2 emissions, and blanket peat, despite drainage, is resistant to decay. It is concluded that losses of soil C are compensated by C uptake by the trees.

AB This field manipulation study tested the effect of weekly pulses of solutions of NH4NO3 and (NH4)(2)SO4 salts on the evolution of CH4 and N2O from peatland soils. Methane and nitrous oxide emission from a nutrient-poor fen in northern Minnesota USA was measured over a full growing season from plots receiving weekly additions of NH4NO3 or (NH4)(2)SO4. At this relatively pristine site, natural additions of N and S in precipitation occur at 8 and 5 kg ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. Nine weekly additions of the dissolved salts were made to increase this to a total deposition of 31 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) on the NH4NO3-amended plots and 30 and 29 kg ha(-1) y(-1) of N and S, respectively, in the (NH4)(2)SO4-amended plots. Methane flux was measured weekly from treatment and control plots and all data comparisons are made on plots measured on the same day.
   After the onset of the treatments, and over the course of the growing season, CH4 emission from the (NH4)(2)SO4-amended plots averaged 163 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1), significantly lower than the same-day control plot mean of 259 mg CH4 m(-)2 d(-)1 (repeated measures ANOVA). Total CH4 flux from (NH4)(2)SO4 treatment plots was one third lower than from control plots, at 11.7 and 17.1 g CH4 m(-2), respectively. Methane emission from the NH4NO3-amended plots (mean of 256 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) was not significantly different from that of controls measured on the same day (mean of 225 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). Total CH4 flux from NH4NO3 treatment plots and same-day controls was 16.9 and 15.1 g CH4 m(-)2, respectively. In general, stable, relatively warm and wet periods followed by environmental 'triggers' such as rainfall or changes in water table or atmospheric pressure, which produced a CH4 'pulse' in the other plots, produced no observable peak in CH4 emission from the (NH4)(2)SO4-amended plots. Nitrous oxide emission from all of the plots was below the detection limit over the course of the experiment.

AB The CoupModel was used to simulate a Norway spruce forest on fertile drained peat over 60 years, from planting in 1951 until 2011, describing abiotic, biotic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO2 and N2O). By calibrating the model against tree ring data a "vegetation fitted" model was obtained by which we were able to describe the fluxes and controlling factors over the 60 years. We discuss some conceptual issues relevant to improving the model in order to better understand peat soil simulations. However, the present model was able to describe the most important ecosystem dynamics such as the plant biomass development and GHG emissions. The GHG fluxes are composed of two important quantities, the spruce forest carbon (C) uptake, 413 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and the decomposition of peat soil, 399 g C m(-2) yr(-1) . N2O emissions contribute to the GHG emissions by up to 0.7 g N m(-2) yr(-1), corresponding to 76 g C m(-2) yr(-1) . The 60-year old spruce forest has an accumulated biomass of 16.0 kg C m(-2) (corresponding to 60 kg CO2 m(-2)). However, over this period, 26.4 kg C m(-2) (97 kg CO2 eq m(-2)) has been added to the atmosphere, as both CO2 and N2O originating from the peat soil and, indirectly, from forest thinning products, which we assume have a short lifetime. We conclude that after harvest at an age of 80 years, most of the stored biomass carbon is liable to be released, the system having captured C only temporarily and with a cost of disappeared peat, adding CO2 to the atmosphere.

AB The aim of the study was to document methane (CH4) dynamics from fen ecosystems in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) in northern Alberta to create a reference database for evaluation of peatland restoration and reclamation projects in the region. The study included three types of fens commonly occurring in this region: poor fen (open and treed), moderately-rich treed fen, and open saline fen (SF). We quantified CH4 fluxes, pore water concentration (PW[CH4]), and production potential together with ecohydrological variables that may influence CH4 dynamics over four growing seasons. Mean (standard deviation) fluxes for open and treed poor fen [99.8 (269.7) and 68.3 (118.8) mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1), respectively] were higher than for treed rich [32.8 (63.7) mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1)] and open SFs [34.6 (91.3) mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1)]. The total growing season CH4 emissions from these fens ranged between 3.7 and 11.3 g CH4 m(-2). Methane production potential varied from 0.1 (0.1) mu mol CH4 g peat(-1) day(-1) at the SF to 4.6 (0.8) mu mol CH4 g peat(-1) day(-1) at the treed rich fen. The variability of CH4 fluxes and pore water concentration between study sites and years was mostly controlled water table (WT) and soil temperature indicating that these variables should be used to assess the expected CH4 flux in peatland reclamation projects. Large inter-annual variability in CH4 flux illustrates the importance of multi-year records for data used in functional evaluation of restoration outcomes.

AB Fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHG) carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured during a two month campaign at a drained peatland forest in Finland by the eddy covariance (EC) technique (CO2 and N2O), and automatic and manual chambers (CO2, CH4 and N2O). In addition, GHG concentrations and soil parameters (mineral nitrogen, temperature, moisture content) in the peat profile were measured. The aim of the measurement campaign was to quantify the GHG fluxes during freezing and thawing of the top-soil, a time period with potentially high GHG fluxes, and to compare different flux measurement methods. The forest was a net CO2 sink during the two months and the fluxes of CO2 dominated the GHG exchange. The peat soil was a small sink of atmospheric CH4 and a small source of N2O. Both CH4 oxidation and N2O production took place in the top-soil whereas CH4 was produced in the deeper layers of the peat, which were unfrozen throughout the measurement period. During the frost-thaw events of the litter layer distinct peaks in CO2 and N2O emissions were observed. The CO2 peak followed tightly the increase in soil temperature, whereas the N2O peak occurred with a delay after the thawing of the litter layer. CH4 fluxes did not respond to the thawing of the peat soil. The CO2 and N2O emission peaks were not captured by the manual chambers and hence we conclude that high time-resolution measurements with automatic chambers or EC are necessary to quantify fluxes during peak emission periods. Sub-canopy EC measurements and chamber-based fluxes of CO2 and N2O were comparable, although the fluxes of N2O measured by EC were close to the detection limit of the system. We conclude that if fluxes are high enough, i.e. greater than 5-10 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), the EC method is a good alternative to measure N2O and CO2 fluxes at ecosystem scale, thereby minimizing problems with chamber enclosures and spatial representativeness of the measurements.

AB Zoige alpine peatland as the highest and largest peat swamp area in the world plays an important role in regulating global climate change and stabilizing GHG emissions, and GHG emissions are getting more and more concern due to water table decline induced by the combined effects of climate warming and digging ditches in Zoige alpine peatland. Therefore, emissions of CH4, CO2, and N2O were investigated in situ along different water table transects in Zoige peatland. Results showed that the CO2 and N2O fluxes increased along the reduced water table gradient except the lowest water table sites, while CH4 flux was decreased. Meanwhile, the global warming potential decreased from 798.6 to 430.9 g CO2 eq m(- 2) h(- 1) with the declined water table. Stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that SOC was the primary factor explaining the variations of CO2 and N2O fluxes across different water table levels, and soil water content was the most important factor to explain the CH4 flux. Water table was the primary driver to determine the GHG fluxes, and the CO2 and N2O emissions were also dependent on the SOC variations. Overall, our results would be beneficial to understand the mechanism of water table effect on GHG emission in alpine peatland ecosystem and provide supports for alpine peatland management in the future.

AB Methane (CH4) flux into the atmosphere during spring thaw was investigated in a small ombrotrophic peatland (141 degrees 48'E, 43 degrees 19'N, Japan) using the conventional chamber method. More than 50 chamber deployments on top of the snow cover were carried out and continued for more than 165 It until the surface snow and underlying ice cover on top of the peat layer had thawed completely. Methane emissions were almost absent in the presence of snow cover. At the very moment the surface ice cover thawed, a large CH4 flush (>10 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) was recorded, which was on the same order of magnitude as episodic ebullition previously observed in the high-summer. Gas bubbles trapped in the ice layer on top of the waterlogged peat were preliminarily analyzed for the volumetric percentage in the total ice volume and their gas species compositions. Results showed that the bubbles occupied about 3.2% volume and that the mixing ratio of CH4 in the bubbles was about 20%. The abundance of the bubble-form CH4 was sufficient to explain the observed episodic CH4 release during the thaw. Results of this study show that CH4 emissions during the thaw season have great temporal variability; emission occurs as an episodic release of bubble-form CH4 stored in the frozen layer. The results also imply the possibility that gas-phase CH4 plays an important role, not only during the growing season but also in cold-season CH4 dynamics in northern peatlands.

AB For the first time, a model that simulates methane emissions from northern peatlands is incorporated directly into a dynamic global vegetation model. The model, LPJ-WHyMe (LPJ Wetland Hydrology and Methane), was previously modified in order to simulate peatland hydrology, permafrost dynamics and peatland vegetation. LPJ-WHyMe simulates methane emissions using a mechanistic approach, although the use of some empirical relationships and parameters is unavoidable. The model simulates methane production, three pathways of methane transport (diffusion, plant-mediated transport and ebullition) and methane oxidation. A sensitivity test was conducted to identify the most important factors influencing methane emissions, followed by a parameter fitting exercise to find the best combination of parameter values for individual sites and over all sites. A comparison of model results to observations from seven sites resulted in normalised root mean square errors (NRMSE) of 0.40 to 1.15 when using the best site parameter combinations and 0.68 to 1.42 when using the best overall parameter combination.

AB The succession of vegetation, soil development, water quality changes, and carbon and nitrogen dynamics are summarized in this article for a pair of 1-hectare flow-through-created riverine wetlands for their first 15 years. Wetland plant richness increased from 13 originally planted species to 116 species overall after 15 years, with most of the increase occurring in the first 5 years. The planted wetland had a higher plant community diversity index for 15 years, whereas the implanted wetland was more productive. Wetland soils turned hydric within a few years; soil organic carbon doubled in 10 years and almost tripled in 15 years. Nutrient removal was similar in the two wetlands in most years, with a trend of decreased removal over 15 years for phosphorus. Denitrification accounted for a small percentage of the nitrogen reduction in the wetlands. The wetlands were effective carbon sinks with retention rates of 1800-2700 kilograms of carbon per hectare per year, higher than in comparable reference wetlands and more commonly studied boreal peatlands. Methane emission rates are low enough to create little concern that the wetlands are net sources of climate change radiative forcing. Planting appears to have influenced carbon accumulation, methane emissions, and macrophyte community diversity.

AB [1] Peatlands represent an important component of the global carbon cycle, storing 23 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Peatland mining eliminates the carbon sink function of the peatland. In this paper we measure the total ecosystem respiration in a natural, 2 and 3 year (young) and 7 and 8 year (old) postcutover peatland near Sainte-Marguerite- Marie, Quebec, during the summers of 1998 and 1999. Although the natural site was a source of CO2 during the dry 1998 study season (138 g C m(-2)), CO2 emissions were between 260 and 290% higher in the cutover sites (363 and 399 g C m(-2) for young and old, respectively). Cutover site CO2 emissions were only 88 and 112 g CO2-C m(-2) at the young and old sites during the wet 1999 study season. Total ecosystem respiration was more dependent on the water table position than on changes in the thermal regime or the labile carbon of the peat in a dry summer, but the opposite was the case in a wet summer. CO2 emissions increased with postharvest time regardless of a decrease in labile carbon, demonstrating that cutover peatlands are a large persistent source of atmospheric CO2. Direct measurement of the net ecosystem CO2 exchange in cutover peatlands, as opposed to determining the loss of carbon from bulk density determinations, provides a better understanding of how peat drainage and harvesting operations affect the carbon balance in peatlands.

AB Combustion of peat leads to emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. In addition, mining of the peat alters the environment such that the natural fluxes of CO2 and other greenhouse gases are modified. Of particular interest is a reduction in the emission of methane (CH4) in the drained parts of the mires. We estimate the total impact on the greenhouse effect of these processes. The results indicate that the decreased emission of methane from the drained mires compensates for about 15% of the CO2 emission during the combustion of the peat. It follows that, in a time perspective of less than several hundred years, peat is comparable to a fossil fuel, as far as the contribution to the greenhouse effect is concerned.

AB Boreal peatlands in Canada have harbored relict permafrost since the Little Ice Age due to the strong insulating properties of peat. Ongoing climate change has triggered widespread degradation of localized permafrost in peatlands across continental Canada. Here, we explore the influence of differing permafrost regimes (bogs with no surface permafrost, localized permafrost features with surface permafrost, and internal lawns representing areas of permafrost degradation) on rates of peat accumulation at the southernmost limit of permafrost in continental Canada. Net organic matter accumulation generally was greater in unfrozen bogs and internal lawns than in the permafrost landforms, suggesting that surface permafrost inhibits peat accumulation and that degradation of surface permafrost stimulates net carbon storage in peatlands. To determine whether differences in substrate quality across permafrost regimes control trace gas emissions to the atmosphere, we used a reciprocal transplant study to experimentally evaluate environmental versus substrate controls on carbon emissions from bog, internal lawn, and permafrost peat. Emissions of CO2 were highest from peat incubated in the localized permafrost feature, suggesting that slow organic matter accumulation rates are due, at least in part, to rapid decomposition in surface permafrost peat. Emissions of CH4 were greatest from peat incubated in the internal lawn, regardless of peat type. Localized permafrost features in peatlands represent relict surface permafrost in disequilibrium with the current climate of boreal North America, and therefore are extremely sensitive to ongoing and future climate change. Our results suggest that the loss of surface permafrost in peatlands increases net carbon storage as peat, though in terms of radiative forcing, increased CH4 emissions to the atmosphere will partially or even completely offset this enhanced peatland carbon sink for at least 70 years following permafrost degradation.

AB [1] The effect of acid rain SO(4)(2-) deposition on peatland CH(4) emissions was examined by manipulating SO(4)(2-) inputs to a pristine raised peat bog in northern Scotland. Weekly pulses of dissolved Na(2)SO(4) were applied to the bog over two years in doses of 25, 50, and 100 kg S ha(-1) yr(-1), reflecting the range of pollutant S deposition loads experienced in acid rain-impacted regions of the world. CH(4) fluxes were measured at regular intervals using a static chamber/gas chromatographic flame ionization detector method. Total emissions of CH(4) were reduced by between 21 and 42% relative to controls, although no significant differences were observed between treatments. Estimated total annual fluxes during the second year of the experiment were 16.6 g m(-2) from the controls and (in order of increasing SO(4)(2-) dose size) 10.7, 13.2, and 9.8 g m(-2) from the three SO(4)(2-) treatments, respectively. The relative extent of CH(4) flux suppression varied with changes in both peat temperature and peat water table with the largest suppression during cool periods and episodes of falling water table. Our findings suggest that low doses of SO(4)(2-) at deposition rates commonly experienced in areas impacted by acid rain, may significantly affect CH(4) emissions from wetlands in affected areas. We propose that SO(4)(2-) from acid rain can stimulate sulfate-reducing bacteria into a population capable of outcompeting methanogens for substrates. We further propose that this microbially mediated interaction may have a significant current and future effect on the contribution of northern peatlands to the global methane budget.

AB With respect to their role in the global carbon cycle, natural peatlands are characterized by their ability to sequester atmospheric carbon. This trait is strongly connected to the water regime of these ecosystems. Large parts of the soil profile in natural peatlands are water saturated, leading to anoxic conditions and to a diminished decomposition of plant litter. In functioning peatlands, the rate of carbon fixation by plant photosynthesis is larger than the decomposition rate of dead organic material. Over time, the amount of carbon that remains in the soil and is not converted back to carbon dioxide grows. Land use of peatlands often goes along with water level manipulations and thereby with alterations of carbon flux dynamics. In this study, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) flux measurements from a bog site in northwestern Germany that has been heavily degraded by peat mining are presented. Two contrasting types of management have been implemented at the site: (1) drainage during ongoing peat harvesting on one half of the central bog area and (2) rewetting on the other half that had been taken out of use shortly before measurements commenced. The presented 2-year data set was collected with an eddy covariance (EC) system set up on a central railroad dam that divides the two halves of the (former) peat harvesting area. We used footprint analysis to split the obtained CO2 and CH4 flux time series into data characterizing the gas exchange dynamics of both contrasting land use types individually. The time series gaps resulting from data division were filled using the response of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to environmental variables, footprint variability, and fuzzy transformations of seasonal and diurnal cyclicity. We used the gap-filled gas flux time series from 2 consecutive years to evaluate the impact of rewetting on the annual vertical carbon balances of the cutover bog. Rewetting had a considerable effect on the annual carbon fluxes and led to increased CH4 and decreased CO2 release.
   The larger relative difference between cumulative CO2 fluxes from the rewetted (13 +/- 6 mol m(-2) a(-1)) and drained (22 +/- 7 mol m(-2) a(-1)) section occurred in the second observed year when rewetting apparently reduced CO2 emissions by 40 %. The absolute difference in annual CH4 flux sums was more similar between both years, while the relative difference of CH4 release between the rewetted (0.83 +/- 0.15 mol m(-2) a(-1)) and drained (0.45 +/- 0.11 mol m(-2) a(-1)) section was larger in the first observed year, indicating a maximum increase in annual CH4 release of 84% caused by rewetting at this particular site during the study period.

AB The effects of elevated ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation on methane dynamics was studied in a natural fen in Northern Finland for three growing seasons (2003-2005). This is the first in situ study on the effects of elevated UV-B radiation on methane dynamics in a natural fen. The experimental setup consisted of 30 study plots (120 x 120 cm) that were randomly divided into three treatments: ambient control, UV-A control and elevated UV-B. The UV-B enhancements were 63, 37 and 21% above ambient during the growing seasons 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Elevated UV-B did not affect net methane emission. Stable isotope composition of methane indicated that methane was produced by the acetate fermentation. Under elevated UV-B there was a slight increase in the concentrations of acetate and propionate but decrease in the oxalate concentration suggesting UV-B-induced changes in the belowground processes. The results emphasize the need for long-term field studies under moderately enhanced exposures to estimate whether the function and feedbacks of mire ecosystems change under increased UV-B radiation.

AB Boreal peatlands represent a significant source of methane to the atmosphere. Pollutants and climate changes resulting from human activity are likely to affect the processes controlling methane emissions from these systems. This study investigated the effects of decadal deposition of nitrogen and sulfate, and increased air temperature, on methane emissions from a northern Swedish peatland during the snow-free seasons of 2005 and 2006, the latter being exceptionally dry. The experimental setup involved a full factorial design at two levels with greenhouse cover (present or absent), nitrogen deposition (2 or 30 kg N ha(-1) a(-1)), and sulfate deposition (3 or 20 kg S ha(-1) a(-1)) as experimental factors. Methane emission rates were measured using static chambers after 10-11 years of experimental manipulations. Emissions were significantly reduced by the greenhouse treatment in 2005, by 30% on average, but not in 2006. The reduction in methane emissions in response to the greenhouse treatment were counteracted by nitrogen deposition; with high nitrogen deposition the effect of the greenhouse cover was low and nonsignificant. High nitrogen deposition increased methane emissions at ambient sulfate levels, probably due to sedge cover increasing from 37 to 65%, but the combination of high nitrogen deposition and high sulfate deposition did not affect methane emissions. Effects of increased nitrogen on methane emission have previously in short-term manipulations (<6 years) been ranging from slightly negative to slightly positive. The substantial positive effects observed in this study emphasize the need for long-term manipulations to obtain valid results under natural conditions.

AB Raised bogs and municipal waste landfills harbor large populations of methanogens within their domed deposits of anoxic organic matter. Although the methane emissions from these sites have been estimated by various methods, limited data exist on the activity of the methanogens at depth. We therefore analyzed the stable isotopic signature of the pore waters in two raised hogs from northern Minnesota to identify depth intervals in the peat profile where methanogenic metabolism occurs. Methanogenesis enriched the deuterium (H-2) content of the deep peat pore waters by as much as +11 parts per thousand (Vienna Standard Mean Sea Water), which compares to a much greater enrichment factor of +70 parts per thousand in leachate from New York City's Fresh Kills landfill. The bog pore waters were isotopically dated by tritium (H-3) to be about 35 years old at 1.5 m depth, whereas the landfill leachate was estimated as similar to 17 years old from Darcy flow calculations. According to an isotopic mass balance the observed deuterium enrichment indicates that about 1.2 g of CH4 m(-3) d(-1) were produced within the deeper peat, compared to about 2.8 g CH4 m(-3) d(-1) in the landfill. The values for methane production in the bog peat are substantially higher than the flux rates measured at the surface of the bogs or at the landfill, indicating that deeper methane production may be much higher than was previously assumed.

AB The majority of peatlands in the temperate zone is subjected to drainage and agricultural land use and have been found to be anthropogenic emission hot spots for greenhouse gases. At the same time, many peatlands receive increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition by intensive agricultural practices. Here we provide eddy covariance measurements determining net ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange at a protected but moderately drained ombrotrophic bog in Northwestern Germany over three consecutive years. The region is dominated by intensive agricultural land use with total (wet and dry) atmospheric N deposition being about 25kgNha(-1)yr(-1). The investigated peat bog was a small net CO2 sink during all three years ranging from -9 to -73gCm(-2)yr(-1). We found temperature- and light-dependent ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross primary production, respectively, but only weak correlations to water table depths despite large interannual and seasonal variability. Significant short-term effects of atmospheric N deposition on CO2 flux components could not be observed, as the primary controlling factors for N deposition and C sequestration, i.e., fertilization of adjacent fields as well as temperature and light availability, respectively, exceeded potential interactions between the two.

AB The moss layer transfer technique removes the top layer of vegetation from donor sites as a method to transfer propagules and restore degraded or reclaimed peatlands. As this technique is new, little is known about the impacts of moss layer transfer on vegetation and carbon fluxes following harvest. We monitored growing season carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes as well as plant communities at donor sites and neighbouring natural peatland sites in an ombrotrophic bog and minerotrophic fen in Alberta, Canada from which material was harvested between 1 and 6 years prior to the study. Plant recovery at all donor sites was rapid with an average of 72% total plant cover one growing season after harvest at the fen and an average of 87% total plant cover two growing seasons after harvest at the bog. Moss cover also returned, averaging 84% 6 years after harvest at the bog. The majority of natural peatlands in western Canada are treed and tree recruitment at the donor sites was limited. Methane emissions were higher from donor sites compared to natural sites due to the high water table and greater sedge cover. Carbon budgets suggested that the donor fen and bog sites released higher CO2 and CH4 over the growing season compared to adjacent natural sites. However, vegetation re-establishment on donor sites was rapid, and it is possible that these sites will return to their original carbon-cycle functioning after disturbance, suggesting that donor sites may recover naturally without implementing management strategies.

AB The depth distributions of anaerobic microbial methane production and potential aerobic microbial methane oxidation were assessed at several sites in both Sphagnum- and sedge-dominated boreal peatlands in Sweden, and compared with net methane emissions from the same sites. Production and oxidation of methane were measured in peat slurries, and emissions were measured with the closed-chamber technique. Over all eleven sites sampled, production was, on average, highest 12 cm below the depth of the average water table. On the other hand, highest potential oxidation of methane coincided with the depth of the average water table. The integrated production rate in the 0-60 cm interval ranged between 0.05 and 1.7 g CH4 m(-2) day(-1) and was negatively correlated with the depth of the average water table (linear regression: r(2) = 0.50, P = 0.015). The depth-integrated potential CH4-oxidation rate ranged between 3.0 and 22.1 g CH4 m(-2) day(-1) and was unrelated to the depth of the average water table. A larger fraction of the methane was oxidized at sites with low average water tables; hence, our results show that low net emission rates in these environments are caused not only by lower methane production rates, but also by conditions more favorable for the development of CH4-oxidizing bacteria in these environments.

AB Small-scale surface heterogeneities can influence land-atmosphere fluxes and therefore carbon, water and energy budgets on a larger scale. This effect is of particular relevance for high-latitude ecosystems, because of the great amount of carbon stored in their soils. We introduce a novel micro-topographic model, the Hummock-Hollow (HH) model, which explicitly represents small-scale surface elevation changes. By computing the water table at the small scale, and by coupling the model with a process-based model for soil methane processes, we are able to model the effects of micro-topography on hydrology and methane emissions in a typical boreal peatland. In order to assess the effect of micro-topography on water the balance and methane emissions of the peatland we compare two versions of the model, one with a representation of micro-topography and a classical single-bucket model version, and show that the temporal variability in the model version with micro-topography performs better if compared with local data. Accounting for micro-topography almost triples the cumulative methane flux over the simulated time-slice. We found that the single-bucket model underestimates methane emissions because of its poor performance in representing hydrological dynamics. The HH model with micro-topography captures the spatial dynamics of water and methane fluxes, being able to identify the hotspots for methane emissions. The model also identifies a critical scale (0.01 km(2)) which marks the minimal resolution for the explicit representation of micro-topography in larger-scale models.

The aim of this study was to determine the size and organic chemistry of the easily degradable C pool in permafrost peatlands and link the functional organic chemistry to temperature and moisture controls of greenhouse gas emissions. First, we used a combination of field measurements and laboratory experiments to assess the influence of increased temperature and flooding on CO2 and CH4 emissions from sixteen permafrost peatlands in subarctic Sweden and Canada. Second, we determined the variation in organic matter chemistry and the associated microbial community composition of the peat active layer, with depth using quantitative C-13 solid-state NMR and molecular biomarkers respectively. We demonstrate that the peat organic chemistry strongly controls CO2 release from peat and that ca. 35 and 26% of the peat organic matter, at the Swedish and Canadian peatlands sites, respectively, is easily degradable by heterotrophic microorganisms. In contrast to CO2, CH4 emissions were decoupled from peat functional organic chemistry. We show a strong relationship between the microbial community structure and the peat organic chemistry suggesting that substrate type and abundance is an important driver of microbial composition in sub-arctic peatlands. Despite considerable variation in peat chemistry and microbial community composition with depth the temperature sensitivity was comparable throughout the active layer. Our study shows that functional organic chemistry controls both soil respiration rates and the composition of the microbial community. Furthermore, if these peatlands collapse and flood on thawing, they are unlikely to become large emitters of CH4 without additional input of labile substrates. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from peatland soil is controlled by rates of organic matter decomposition; soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition is influenced by the quality of the SOM and the soil temperature. This study determined the effect of increasing temperature and SOM quality on rates of greenhouse-gas production in lab incubations from peat soils formed under different plant functional types found in temperate rich and poor fens of southern Ontario, Canada. Peat derived from different plant functional type (sedge, shrub, and non-vascular vegetation) between the fens was composed of different amounts of SOM, lignin, and cellulose. Rates of CO2 and CH4 production from the lab slurriesin creased with increasing temperature; however, the relative increases were specific to the vegetation type overlying the soils. Anaerobic to aerobic production ratios ranged from 7% (Chamaedaphne soils) to > 30% (Sphagnum soils). Ratios of potential anaerobic production (CO2 to CH4) generally decreasedwith increasing temperature. The interaction between temperature and SOM quality was demonstrated through the range of Q(10) values (1.09-2.38 for CO2; 2.98-21.40 for CH4). These measures were correlated to lignin and cellulose content and the lingo-cellulose index. Results of this study indicate the variability of greenhouse-gas fluxes from peatland soils is influenced by the SOM quality derived from the overlying vegetation. As the climate warms soil temperatures will increase rates of decomposition, and this study will improve models of temperate peatland carbon cycling and can inform land management planning by providing options for minimizing carbon loss.

AB A burning peat site in the Po Valley ( Italy) has been investigated for the first time. Beyond the smoke from the smoldering combustion of peat, there are carbonatic concretions and huge amounts of methane in the soil (> 60% by vol.), leading to fluxes to the atmosphere of the order of 10(2)-10(3) mg m(-2) d(-1). A wide range of analyses ( gas composition, stable isotopes of CH4 and CaCO3, methane radiocarbon) were performed in order to understand whether methane is produced by peat layers or seeps from deeper natural gas reservoirs. The quasi-fossil character of CH4, methane-derived carbonates, methane-stable isotopic compositions related to marine carbonates reduction, the presence of helium, and a fault corresponding to the burning site all converge to indicate that the major part of the methane ascends from deep horizons. Such methane seepage is likely to feed the peat combustion, explaining the observed phenomena and the large outbursts of historical gas-emission events.

ID CARBON-DIOXIDE; FLUXES; BUBBLES; LAKE
AB Recent works on CH4 emissions from peatlands have demonstrated that ebullition can be a more important emission pathway than it has been thought. However, knowledge of its features and associated environmental factors is still very limited. In this study, we investigated the quantitative relationship between the amount of CH4 emitted via ebullition and changes in the atmospheric pressure through a laboratory experiment. During the flux measurement period, ebullition was recorded almost exclusively in air-pressure-declining phases. The increased volume of the gas bubbles due to reduction in atmospheric pressure and the amount of released gas bubbles revealed a strong linear relation, suggesting that in situ CH4 emissions via ebullition can be estimated using this correlation. Our results clearly showed that atmospheric pressure can be one of the most important factors to control CH4 emissions from peatlands and that ebullition can be the main transport mechanism during the pressure-falling phase.

AB Methane (CH4) flux was measured from undrained, drained, and ditched portions of treed fen, forested bog, and treed bog sites in the Wally Creek experimental drainage site (near Cochrane, Ontario), from May to October 1991. Drainage for 7 years lowered the water table from between -21 and -49 cm to -41 and -93 cm at the three respective sites. Drainage resulted in a conversion of the peatlands from a CH4 source (0 to 15 mg CH4 . m(-2). d(-1)) to a small CH4 sink (0 to -0.4 mg CH4 . m(-2). d(-1)). In contrast, CH4 efflux from the ditches ranged from <5 to >400 mg CH4 . m(-2). d(-1). The flux data were used to estimate the impact of forest drainage practices on net CH4 emissions from a forest drainage complex. For the treed and forested bogs, there was a net increase in CH4 emissions where ditch spacing was closer than 38 m. Even with very close ditch spacing (>12 m), there was a net decrease in CH4 flux from the treed fen. The results of this study indicate that the combination of low antecedent CH4 fluxes from an undrained peatland, and moderate fluxes from the drainage ditches, will produce a net increase in CH4 emissions from forest drainage.

AB Methane emissions from peat bogs are strongly reduced by aerobic methane oxidising bacteria (methanotrophs) living in association with Sphagnum spp. Field studies and laboratory experiments have revealed that, with increasing water level and temperature, methanotrophic activity increases. To gain a better understanding of how longer term changes in methanotrophic activity are reflected in methanotroph biomarkers, a peat record (0-100 cm) from the Hautes-Fagnes (Belgium) encompassing the past 1500 years, was analysed for methanotroph-specific intact bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs) and the carbon isotopic composition of diploptene. A predominance of aminobacteriohopanetetrol (aminotetrol) over aminobacteriohopanepentol (aminopentol) indicated the prevalence of type II methanotrophs. Relatively high methanotrophic activity was indicated by all methanotroph markers between 20 and 45 cm depth, around the present oxic-anoxic boundary, most likely representing the currently active methanotrophic community. Comparing methanotrophic markers in the deeper part of the peat profile with environmental variables afforded, however, no clear correlation between change in water level and methanotrophic activity. This is potentially caused by a predominance of type II methanotrophs, a combination of sources for methanotrophic biomarkers or insufficient variation in climatic changes. A proposed way forward would include a study of a core covering a longer timescale, thereby involving greater variability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The area of wet grasslands on peat soil in the Netherlands is slowly increasing at the expense of drained, agriculturally used grasslands. This study aimed (i) to assess the contribution of wet grasslands on peat soil to methane (CH(4)) emissions, and (ii) to explain differences among sites and between years in order to improve our understanding of controlling factors. For these purposes, a field study was conducted in the period 1994-1996 in the nature preserve "Nieuwkoopse Plassen", which is a former peat mining and agricultural area. Net CH(4) emissions were measured weekly to monthly with vented closed flux chambers at three representative sites, and at ditches near these sites. Three-years average of CH(4) emissions was 7.9 g CH(4) m(-2) yr(-1) for Drie Berken Zudde, 13.3 for Koole, and 20.4 for Brampjesgat. Ditches near the sites emitted 4.2-22.5 g CH(4) m(-2) yr(-1). The time-course of CH(4) emissions for all experimental sites and years was fit with a multiple linear regression model with ground water level and soil temperature as independent variables. Lowering or raising the ground water level by 5 cm could decrease or increase CH(4) emissions by 30-50%. Therefore, ground water level management of these grasslands should be done with care.

AB Peatland ecosystems may contribute about 65% of all natural methane emission to the atmosphere.  During May-June 1988, CH4 and CO2 fluxes were measured with the static chamber method at the surface of a basin swamp and at three depths.  The daily average fluxes of CH4 and CO2 at the surface of the swamp ranged from 1.146 to 2.178 mmol m-2 d-1 and from 1.966 to 7.242 mmol m-2 d-1, respectively.  These amounts of CH4 and CO2 corresponded to 0.02-0.03% of what was released from the 45 to 60-cm depth when exposed to atmospheric pressure.  Statistically significant correlations between physical and botanical peat properties and trapped CH4 and CO2 and water flow suggest that outgassing of trapped CH4 and CO2 are closely associated with the peat matrix, peat properties, hydraulic potential, temperature, and concentration gradients.

AB Boreal peatlands represent a globally important store of carbon, and disturbances such as wildfire can have a negative feedback to the climate. Understanding how carbon exchange and greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics are impacted after a wildfire is important, especially as boreal peatlands may be vulnerable to changes in wildfire regime under a rapidly changing climate. However, given this vulnerability, there is very little in the literature on the impact such fires have on methane (CH4) emissions. This study investigated the effect of wildfire on CH4 emissions at a boreal fen near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, that was partially burned by the Horse River Wildfire in 2016. We measured CH4 emissions and environmental variables (20172018) and CH4 production potential (2018) in two different microform types (hummocks and hollows) across a peat burn severity gradient (unburned (UB), moderately burned (MB), and severely burned (SB)). Results indicated a switch in the typical understanding of boreal peatland CH4 emissions. For example, emissions were significantly lower in the MB and SB hollows in both years compared to UB hollows. Interestingly, across the burned sites, hummocks had higher fluxes in 2017 than hollows at the MB and SB sites. We found typically higher emissions at the UB site where the water table was close to the surface. However, at the burned sites, no relationship was found between CH4 emissions and water table, even under similar hydrological conditions. There was also significantly higher CH4 production potential from the UB site than the burned sites. The reduction in CH4 emissions and production in the hollows at burned sites highlights the sensitivity of hollows to fire, removing labile organic material for potential methanogenesis. The previously demonstrated resistance of hummocks to fire also results in limited impact on CH4 emissions and likely faster recovery to pre-fire rates. Given the potential initial net cooling effect resulting from a reduction in CH4 emissions, it is important that the radiative effect of all GHGs following wildfire across peatlands is taken into account.

AB Reflooding formerly drained peatlands has been proposed as a means to reduce losses of organic matter and sequester soil carbon for climate change mitigation, but a renewal of high methane emissions has been reported for these ecosystems, offsetting mitigation potential. Our ability to interpret observed methane fluxes in reflooded peatlands and make predictions about future flux trends is limited due to a lack of detailed studies of methanogenic processes. In this study we investigate methanogenesis in a reflooded agricultural peatland in the Sacramento Delta, California. We use the stable-and radio-carbon isotopic signatures of wetland sediment methane, ecosystem-scale eddy covariance flux observations, and laboratory incubation experiments, to identify which carbon sources and methanogenic production pathways fuel methanogenesis and how these processes are affected by vegetation and seasonality. We found that the old peat contribution to annual methane emissions was large (~30%) compared to intact wetlands, indicating a biogeochemical legacy of drainage. However, fresh carbon and the acetoclastic pathway still accounted for the majority of methanogenesis throughout the year. Although temperature sensitivities for bulk peat methanogenesis were similar between open-water (Q(10) = 2.1) and vegetated (Q(10) = 2.3) soils, methane production from both fresh and old carbon sources showed pronounced seasonality in vegetated zones. We conclude that high methane emissions in restored wetlands constitute a biogeochemical trade-off with contemporary carbon uptake, given that methane efflux is fueled primarily by fresh carbon inputs.

SO MICROBIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The changes in the rates of methane formation and consumption by microorganisms in the tundra hummock-depressional bog complex and in diverse nutritive type of middle taiga bogs were studied. The bog soils served as natural biofilters for methane. The methane in deep layers of water-logged depressions was efficiently consumed both in upper layers and nearby unflooded soil. Methane was consumed in neutral soils as well as in sphagnum bogs of pH 4.2 which indicates the presence of the appropriate methanotrophic microflora. Methane formation under the water surface was due to the activity of the psychrophilic methanogenic community. The rates of methane emission from bog soils into the atmosphere was 0.28-7.85 Mg CH4/(m2.h) for tundra and 0.03-4.23 mg CH4/(m2.h) for the middle taiga.

AB [1] Peatlands are sinks for carbon dioxide (CO2) because net primary production exceeds decomposition. The contribution of non-growing-season fluxes to the annual C budget of a peatland is, to date, little studied. We therefore measured the changes in the pattern of carbon exchange with seasons in a bog located in the cool temperate climate region. The growing season CO2-C uptake was of -113 g m(-2). During the non-growing season, 36 g C m(-2) was lost to the atmosphere, resulting in an estimated net ecosystem production of -76 g C m(-2). Despite the non-growing-season loss equaling 33 to 40% of the summer uptake, the net annual accumulation of was 3 times the long-term average net accumulation rate usually cited in the literature. The high rate of non-growing-season efflux could be supported directly by temporal concurrent respiration and the release of stored CO2 from prior production. These results indicate the need to revise current models to address peat thermal properties inducing CO2 production at lower temperature ranges.

AB Methane emissions from northern peatlands are strongly dependent on soil temperatures. Therefore, to predict methane emissions from northern peatlands under future climatic conditions, it is important to simulate the effect of these changing climatic conditions on peat temperatures. This article reports on the development and testing of two one-dimensional (1D) models used to simulate soil temperatures at shallow depths in a northern peatland. First, the HIP-Dlet (Heat in Peat - Dirichlet) model applies measured temperatures to the surface boundary of a conduction-based temperature model. Secondly, the HIP-Nmann (Heat in Peat - von Neumann) model simulates the surface boundary from standard meteorological measurements. The HIP-Dlet model provides a reasonable to good approximation of measured temperatures showing that heat transport processes within the soil are adequately simulated. The model does not simulate an advective liquid heat flux. However, only substantial rainfall events (> 70 mm over 3 days) during the study period had any significant effect on model error. Errors in the HIP-Nmann model were of a similar magnitude to the HIP-Dlet model. Errors in the HIP-Dlet model resulted predominantly from errors in the measured soil temperatures. Errors in the HIP-Nmann were due to errors in the measured soil temperatures and the inaccurate simulation of the surface boundary condition. The development of future peatland temperature models should, therefore, focus on the simulation of the surface boundary condition, particularly the parameterisation of the surface resistance that is shown here to produce significant errors in the modelled soil temperatures.

AB Methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange were investigated over 15 months above a natural bog-pine site in the pre-alpine region of southern Germany. The measurements indicate annual methane emissions of +5.3+/-0.34 g C m(-2) a(-1) and an annual CO2 uptake of -62+/-20 g C m(-2) a(-1), resulting in a global warming potential balance of -50+/-74 g [CO2 eq.] m(-2) a(-1). Air temperature was identified as the environmental parameter showing the highest correlation with methane production, except for periods with low water table (<-0.12 m). Furthermore, we compared three different methane flux gap-filling methods: the mean daily variation approach (MDV), a look up table (LUT) with various control parameters and an exponential regression function between methane flux and air temperature (NLR). It turns out that the LUT provides the best result for the gap-filling of half-hourly CH4 fluxes for the present data. By increasing the number of parameters in the LUT, the CH4 flux prediction could be considerably improved. Except for dry periods, day to day variations could be reproduced very well by the NLR method, but results for sub-daily fluctuations were poor. The choice of gap-filling method affects the annual methane budget estimate by at most 0.5 g C m(-2) a(-1), or about 10% of the annual flux.
   This study presents one of the first eddy covariance based annual methane- and CO2-exchange estimates over a natural bog-pine ecosystem outside the boreal zone. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB [1] Peatlands deform elastically during precipitation cycles by small (+/- 3 cm) oscillations in surface elevation. In contrast, we used a Global Positioning System network to measure larger oscillations that exceeded 20 cm over periods of 4 - 12 hours during two seasonal droughts at a bog and fen site in northern Minnesota. The second summer drought also triggered 19 depressuring cycles in an overpressured stratum under the bog site. The synchronicity between the largest surface deformations and the depressuring cycles indicates that both phenomena are produced by the episodic release of large volumes of gas from deep semi-elastic compartments confined by dense wood layers. We calculate that the three largest surface deformations were associated with the release of 136 g CH4 m(-2), which exceeds by an order of magnitude the annual average chamber fluxes measured at this site. Ebullition of gas from the deep peat may therefore be a large and previously unrecognized source of radiocarbon depleted methane emissions from northern peatlands.

AB Northern peatlands represent a globally important stock of soil carbon and have acted as a net sink of atmospheric CO2 throughout the Holocene. Disturbance for horticultural peat extraction disrupts ecosystem function and converts these ecosystems to large, persistent sources of carbon dioxide (CO2). This study investigates the effect of ecosystem-scale restoration on growing season CO2 exchange in a peatland by comparing a restored site to a neighboring nonrestored section for 1 year prerestoration (1999) and 3 years postrestoration (2000-2002). Prior to restoration, less than 23% of the site was vegetated, and it was a source of 245 g C m(-2) to the atmosphere during the growing season (May to early October). Following restoration, the water table remained deep, and soil moisture was significantly higher than the nonrestored section. By the third year postrestoration, vegetation covered 50% of the restored peatland. Moss covered 90% of this vegetated area. Vegetation productivity at the restored site was also enhanced with gross ecosystem photosynthesis under full light conditions significantly higher at the restored site at both moss and herbaceous plots by 2002. While this increase in vegetation productivity provided fresh substrate and resulted in higher CO2 production potential for restored site peat, ecosystem respiration was similar to or lower than that at the nonrestored site for both bare peat and vegetated areas because of the generally wetter site conditions resulting from restoration. By upscaling chamber CO2 exchange measurements to the ecosystem level, on the basis of the relative proportion of each surface cover type, we determined the site was a net sink of similar to 20 +/- 5 g C m(-2) during the growing season only 2 years postrestoration. Combining our results with previous work on CH4 emissions and dissolved organic carbon export, we suggest that this degraded peatland ecosystem will likely return to a net carbon sink in 6 to 10 years postrestoration.

AB Peatlands are a large natural source of atmospheric methane (CH4), and the sedge Carex rostrata plays a critical role in the production, oxidation, and transport of CH4 in these systems. This 4 year clipping experiment examined the changes in CH4 emissions from a temperate peatland after removing all aboveground C. rostrata biomass. Methane fluxes, dissolved CH4, and environmental variables were measured during spring, summer, and fall from 2008 to 2011. Clipping and removing the C. rostrata leaves and stems caused an immediate decrease in CH4 emissions that persisted over 4 years of this study. There was a strong seasonal trend in CH4 flux, with the largest treatment effects occurring during the fall months when the sedges were senescing. As expected, there was a strong positive correlation between C. rostrata green-leaf area and CH4 flux, implying that the presence of C. rostrata increases CH4 emissions from this peatland. Large interannual variability in vegetation distribution and biomass, water table depth, and temperature was observed in this study, indicating the importance of multiyear studies for understanding the interactions among these factors to determine how they could be incorporated into biogeochemical models to predict CH4 emissions under changing environmental conditions.
   Key Points
   Clipping aboveground sedge biomass decreases methane emissions from wetlands Carex rostrata has greatest impact on methane emissions during fall senescence

AB The emission of methane (1.3 mmol of CH4 m(-2) day(-1)), precursors of methanogenesis, and the methano-genic microorganisms of acidic bog peat (pH 4.4) from a moderately reduced forest site were investigated by in situ measurements, microcosm incubations, and cultivation methods, respectively. Bog peat produced CH4 (0.4 to 1.7 mumol g [dry wt] of soil(-1) day(-1)) under anoxic conditions. At in situ pH, supplemental H-2-CO2, ethanol, and 1-propanol all increased CH4 production rates while formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate inhibited the production of CH4; methanol had no effect. H-2-dependent acetogenesis occurred in H-2-CO2-supplemented bog peat only after extended incubation periods. Nonsupplemented bog peat initially produced small amounts of H-2 that were subsequently consumed. The accumulation of H-2 was stimulated by ethanol and 1-propanol or by inhibiting methanogenesis with bromoethanesulfonate, and the consumption of ethanol was inhibited by large amounts of H-2; these results collectively indicated that ethanol- or 1-propanol-utilizing bacteria were trophically associated with H-2-utilizing methanogens. A total of 10(9) anaerobes and 10(7) hydrogenotrophic methanogens per g (dry weight) of bog peat were enumerated by cultivation techniques. A stable methanogenic enrichment was obtained with an acidic, H-2-CO2-supplemented, fatty acid-enriched defined medium. CH4 production rates by the enrichment were similar at pH 4.5 and 6.5, and acetate inhibited methanogenesis at pH 4.5 but not at pH 6.5. A total of 27 different archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences indicative of Methanobacteriaceae, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanosarcinaceae were retrieved from the highest CH4-positive serial dilutions of bog peat and methanogenic enrichments. A total of 10 bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were also retrieved from the same dilutions and enrichments and were indicative of bacteria that might be responsible for the production of H-2 that could be used by hydrogenotrophic methanogens. These results indicated that in this acidic bog peat, (i) H-2 is an important substrate for acid-tolerant methanogens, (ii) interspecies hydrogen transfer is involved in the degradation of organic carbon, (iii) the accumulation of protonated volatile fatty acids inhibits methanogenesis, and (iv) methanogenesis might be due to the activities of methanogens that are phyllogenetic members of the Methanobacteriaceae, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanosarcinaceae.

AB Methane (CH4) fluxes from fixed sample plots in a minerotrophic fen and an ombrotrophic bog in southern Finland were measured by using a static chamber technique 1 year before and 2 years after a rewetting treatment. Methane emissions rose with rising water table after rewetting from 0.1 to 2.1 g.m(-2).a(-1) at the fen site and from 0.8 to 4.6 g.m(-2).a(-1) at the bag site remained at a lower level than emissions from similar pristine site types. At the fen site the emissions were related to the short-term succession of cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum L.). Emissions showed high spatial and temporal variation with high emission peaks at the bog site. Temporal fluctuation of the emissions during the measurement season (from the end of May to the end of September) was correlated with pear temperature, while the seasonal fluxes were dependent on the moisture conditions in different microsites.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the interannual variation during 1981-1997 in methane emission from an oligotrophic lawn plant community in a boreal mire. Daily mean air temperatures and daily accumulated precipitation figures were used as forcing variables for a mechanistic soil physical model, to generate estimates for the depths of snow, soil frost, and water table, together with soil temperature profiles. Methane emissions were then simulated with a mechanistic mixed mire methane model, described in this paper. The methane model simulated total methane emission rates separated into diffusion, ebullition, and plant-mediated transport. The climate record for 1981-1997 represented almost the total range in growing season temperature sums in northern Sweden during the twentieth century. The average temperature sum for 1980-1997 was 735 (range 553-981) degree days. The average accumulated annual precipitation during the same period was 283 (range 140-397) mm. The integrated simulated annual methane emission during 1981-1997 varied almost threefold among years, with a mean of 17.4 +/- 1.1 (SE) and a range of 11 to 27 g m(-2). The simulated annual emissions for the three calibration years 1995-1997 were 18, 14, and 22 g m(-2), respectively, slightly higher than the integrated measured emissions over the growing season (May-September), which were 16, 13, and 18 g m(-2) y(-1), respectively. Given the model formulation and parameterization, the single most important climatic predictor of simulated annual methane emission was mean water table position (r(2) = 0.58). Adding annual soil temperature sum at 26 cm in a multiple regression solution significantly increased the explained variance (R-2 = 0.85). The study emphasizes that interannual variability in methane emission may be large, and therefore extrapolations of annual methane emissions must be based on time series that adequately span the interannual variability in the local climate.

AB As fen peatlands have been heavily disturbed by resource extraction in northeastern Alberta, Canada, fen construction has been completed. In order to optimize biogeochemical function of future constructed fens, it is beneficial to understand methane (CH4) cycling of newly constructed fens, and how revegetation strategies influence CH4 dynamics. Here, we investigate the effects of two vascular species used for fen construction on CH4 dynamics. A factorial greenhouse experiment using peat columns and a laboratory incubation experiment were used to understand differences in CH4 production, emissions, pore water concentration, and oxidation between Carex aquatilis Wahlenb. and Juncus balticus Willd. The experiment also considered how water sourced from the constructed fen influenced CH4 dynamics compared to natural rich fen water. Higher pore water CH4 concentration and potential CH4 production were found at C. aquatilis columns, possibly associated with higher labile carbon throughout the column. In columns with J. balticus, evidence to support radial oxygen loss reducing CH4 concentration and production was found. Water sampled from peat columns with constructed fen water had higher Fe (all cation forms), Mn (all cation forms), SO42-, and NO3- compared to columns with rich fen water, which corresponded to lower CH4 emissions and pore water concentration. Results from this study could be used to inform revegetation designs of future constructed fens that consider greenhouse gas emissions, including CH4, as a reclamation goal.

AB Methane (CH4) fluxes in boreal peatlands are vulnerable to global change, including climate warming, elevated nitrogen (N) deposition, and vegetation composition change. However, few studies focus on the interactions of these factors, particularly combining all of them, which leads to a large degree of uncertainty in predicting CH4 emissions from peatlands in the future. In this study, experimental warming, N addition, and vegetation composition change were conducted for five years at a boreal peatland in western Newfoundland, Canada. We found that graminoid absence substantially decreased CH4 emissions by 72% owing to the reduction of root exudates for CH4 production and aerenchyma for CH4 transport; however, this negative effect disappeared under the combination of warming and N addition, which can be attributed to the elevated temperature sensitivity of CH4. Additionally, we observed that vegetation productivity was the main control when the graminoid was present, but not the major control when the shrub was present only, suggesting the proper parameters should be selected under different vegetation compositions so as to accurately project CH4 emissions in the context of climate change. Compared with the studies focusing on one or two environmental changes, this experiment is valuable for providing empirical evidence on the parameterization of CH4 fluxes in the biogeochemical model of boreal peatlands and in the global coupled climate-carbon model.

AB Peat forming wetlands are globally important sources of the greenhouse gas CH4. The variability of flux recordings from peatlands is however considerable and the distribution of CH4 below the water table poorly described. Surface peat (0-500 mm below the water table) is responsible for the bulk of emissions and a localised region of intense CH4 concentration may exist within this region but the structure of peat and presence of gas bubbles make the determination of in situ gas distributions problematic. We report on the in situ distribution and concentrations of CH4, CO2 and O-2 in surface bog peat cores using Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry and relate this to peat physical structure. Replicate cores collected in spring and autumn from both hollows and hummocks are used (n = 10). CH4 recorded in almost every profile was localised in intense peaks reaching concentrations up to 350 mu M at depths where O-2 was absent. Each CH4 peak had a coincident CO2 peak with a minimum mean ratio of similar to 20:1 (CO2:CH4) and we found more CH4 beneath hollows than hummocks. In statistical comparisons CH4 concentration and distribution differed significantly between profiles for each depth. We demonstrate that variability found within a single core is at least as great as that between cores collected across the bog. The distribution of CH4 was negatively correlated with bulk density and in some cases the location of roots matched those of intense CH4 concentration where bubbles had formed and been trapped. Our comparisons suggest variability in gas distribution is caused by a heterogenous peat structure that controls the movement of gas bubbles and contains localised hotspots of gas production. The small and fine root systems of vascular plants on the peatland surface may cause high levels of methanogenic activity in their vicinity and also represent a physical barrier capable of trapping CH4 bubbles.

AB To study the effects of elevated ozone concentration on methane dynamics and a sedge species, Eriophorum vaginatum, we exposed peatland microcosms, isolated by coring from an oligotrophic pine fen, to double ambient ozone concentration in an open-air ozone exposure field for four growing seasons. The field consists of eight circular plots of which four were fumigated with elevated ozone concentration and four were ambient controls. At the latter part of the first growing season (week 33, 2003), the methane emission was 159 +/- 14 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) (mean +/- SE) in the ozone treatment and 214 +/- 8 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) under the ambient control. However, towards the end of the experiment the ozone treatment slightly, but consistently, enhanced the methane emission. At the end of the third growing season (2005), microbial biomass (estimated by phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers) was higher in peat exposed to ozone (1975 +/- 108 nmol g(-1) dw) than in peat of the control microcosms (1589 +/- 115 nmol g(-1) dw). The concentrations of organic acids in peat pore water showed a similar trend. Elevated ozone did not affect the shoot length or the structure of the sedge E. vaginatum leaves but it slightly increased the total number of sedge leaves towards the end of the experiment. Our results indicate that elevated ozone concentration enhances the general growth conditions of microbes in peat by increasing their substrate availability. However, the methane production did not reflect the increase in the concentration of organic acids, probably because hydrogenotrophic methane production dominated in the peat studied. Although, we used isolated peatland microcosms with limited size as study material, we did not find experimental factors that could have hampered the basic conclusions on the effects of ozone.

TI Generation and emission of greenhouse gases in bogs
SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The profile distribution, generation, and emission of CO2 and CH4 in the bog soils of four experimental plots in European Russia and Eastern Siberia have been studied using original experimental procedures. The effective diffusion coefficients of gases were determined in peatlands for the entire range of aeration porosity; upward and downward vertical fluxes were evaluated. The total production of gases by the peatland during the vegetation period was estimated from the kinetic balance model of their behavior in the soil. It was shown that the generation intensity of greenhouse gases in bogs can significantly (by 10-20%) exceed their emission from the surface. The information about the gas-generating function of bog is used for the determination of their carbon sequestration capacity.

AB At two field sites representing northeastern German minerotrophic fens (Rhin-Havelluch, a shallow peat site; Gumnitz, a partially drained peat site) the influence of different factors (N fertilization, groundwater table, temperature) on N2O and CH4 emissions was investigated. The degraded fens were sources or sinks of the radiatively active trace gases investigated. The gas fluxes measured were much higher than those found in other terrestrical ecosystems such as forests. Lowering the groundwater table increased the release of N2O and the oxidation of CH4. High CH4 emission rates occurred when the groundwater tables and soil temperatures were high (>12 degrees C). N fertilization stimulated the release of N2O only when application rates were very high (480 kg N ha(-1)). A moderate N supply (60 or 120 kg N ha(-1)) hardly increased the release of N2O in spite of high soluble soil NO3- contents.

AB Exposure to sunshine is known to play a role in litter decomposition in some semi-arid areas. The aim of this study was to find out if it also plays a role in higher latitude environments in peat litter decomposition and could contribute to an explanation to the patchy nature of peat litter decomposition. Peat litter from 5 microenvironments (top of slope, bottom of slope, ridge, ryam and hollow) and put out and exposed to the sun or shaded over a summer in Western Siberia, 26 km west of the town of Khanty-Mansiysk. Afterwards the peat litter was incubated in the laboratory - at field capacity or submerged in peat water - and CO2 and methane emission measured. Chemical composition of exposed and control peat litter was also investigated using stepwise extraction.
   The results indicate that exposure to sunlight does increase subsequent decomposition rate in most peat litters when incubated at field capacity, but the difference between the treatments levelled off at the end of the 2 weeks incubation in most peat litter types. The total extra carbon loss was calculated to be up to about 2 mg Cm-2 over a season. When incubated submerged previous photo-exposure had less effect on CO2 evolution then when incubated at field capacity. No methane emission was recorded in any treatment. Some differences in chemical composition between exposed and shaded peat litters were found that could help explain the differences in subsequent decomposition rate. The results indicate that photodegradation could play a role in peat litter decomposition at higher latitudes when peat is disturbed and exposed to sunshine. However, the effect of photo exposure in these areas is much smaller than observed in semi-arid areas at lower latitudes.

AB Two peatland micro-relief forms (microforms) - hummocks and hollows - differ by their hydrological characteristics (water table level, i.e. oxic-anoxic conditions) and vegetation communities. We studied the CH4 and CO2 production potential and the localization of methanogenic pathways in both hummocks and hollows at depths of 15, 50, 100, 150 and 200 cm in a laboratory incubation experiment. For this purpose, we measured CH4 and CO2 production rates, peat elemental composition, as well as delta C-13 values of gases and solids; the specific inhibitor of methanogenesis BES (2-bromo-ethane sulfonate, 1 mM) was aimed to preferentially block the acetoclastic pathway.
   The cumulative CH4 production of all depths was almost one fold higher in hollows than in hummocks, with no differences in CO2. With depth, CO2 and CH4 production decreased, and the relative contribution of the hydrogenotrophic pathway of methanogenesis increased. The highest methanogenic activity among all depths and both microforms was measured at 15 cm of hollows (91%) at which the highest relative contribution of acetoclastic vs. hydrogenotrophic pathway (92 and 8%, respectively) was detected. For hummocks, the CH4 production was the highest at 50 cm (82%), where relative contribution of acetoclastic methanogenesis comprised 89%. The addition of 1 mM BES was not selective and inhibited both methanogenic pathways in the soil. Thus, BES was less efficient in partitioning the pathways compared with the delta C-13 signature. We conclude that the peat microforms - dry hummocks and wet hollows - play an important role for CH4 but not for CO2 production when the effects of living vegetation are excluded.

AB This study brings together plot-scale growing season fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from six Canadian peatlands restored by the moss layer transfer technique (MLTT) and compares them with fluxes from adjacent unrestored and natural peatlands to determine: 1) if CO2 and CH4 fluxes return to natural-site levels and 2) whether the ecohydrological controls (e.g. water table, plant cover) on these fluxes are similar between treatments. We also examine differences between eastern (humid/maritime climate) and western (sub-humid climate) Canadian plots, and between restoration of former horticultural peat extraction sites and oil industry well-pads. Our results indicate that restored site fluxes of CO2 and CH4 are not significantly different between eastern and western Canada or between a restored well-pad and restored horticultural peat extraction sites. Restoration resulted in gross primary production rates similar to those at natural plots and significantly greater than those at unrestored plots. Ecosystem respiration was not significantly different at restored and unrestored plots, and was lower at both than at natural plots. Methane emission was significantly greater at restored plots than at unrestored plots, but remained significantly lower on average than at natural plots. Water table was a significant control on CH4 flux across restored and natural plots. Vascular plant cover was significantly related to CO2 uptake (gross photosynthesis) at restored and unrestored plots, but not at natural plots, while higher moss cover resulted in significantly greater net uptake of CO2 at natural plots but not at restored and unrestored plots. Overall, MLTT restoration greatly alters CO2 and CH4 dynamics compared to unrestored areas but fluxes remain, on average, significantly different from those in natural peatlands, in both the magnitude of mean growing season fluxes and controls on variation in these fluxes among plots. Peatland restoration by MLTT results in reduced CO2 emissions and higher CH4 emissions; however, more year-round measurements in more restored peatlands over longer periods post-restoration are needed to improve greenhouse gas emission estimates for restored Canadian peatlands.

AB Eddy correlation measurements of methane flux were made at a fen in central Saskatchewan, as part of the Boreal Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) in 1994. Data were collected from mid-May to early October. The water table was above the average peat surface throughout the measurement period. Detailed (near continuous) measurements allowed examination of temporal variability at hourly and daily timescales. As compared with the average nighttime flux, the average daytime methane flux was 25-45% higher in July and in August and 5-15% higher earlier and later in the season. Distribution of midday (1130-1430 LT) methane emission showed varying trends in different parts of the season. From mid-May to early July, methane flux gradually increased from near zero to 4.1 mg m(-2) h(-1). The water table height (above an average hollow surface) varied from 0.09 to 0.18 m, but the trend in methane flux followed peat temperature (at 0.1-m depth) more closely. The peat warmed from 3.4 degrees to 16.3 degrees C during this time period. Methane flux was negligible until peat temperature (at 0.1-m depth) was above 12 degrees C. From early July to early August there was a fivefold increase in methane flux from 4.1 to its seasonal peak of 19.5 mg m(-2) h(-1) on August 1. The water table ranged from 0.23 m to a brief seasonal plateau of 0.30 m on July 20-23. Sharp increases in the water table were followed by increasing trends in methane flux by approximately 12 days. Feat temperature reached its seasonal maximum (19.3 degrees C) the same time when the methane flux peaked. After early August the methane flux declined steadily and reached a value of 2.4 mg m(-2) h(-1) in early October. The water table and peat temperature showed comparable trends and decreased steadily to 0.06 m and 5.7 degrees C, respectively. The seasonally integrated methane emission (mid-May to early October) was estimated at 16.3 g C m(-2). Nonlinear regression analysis of methane flux against water table (lagged by 12 days) and peat temperature was performed for different periods of the season. Except for a brief period of very high water table (when many hummocks were inundated) the regression using water table and peat temperature explained between 68 and 94% of the variability in methane flux. The sensitivity of methane flux to water table (or the slope of the log CH4 flux/water table relationship) obtained from our daily flux values ranged from 3.4 x 10(-4) to 5.0 x 10(-4) m(-1).

AB Precipitation patterns are becoming increasingly extreme, particularly at northern latitudes. Current climate models predict that this trend will continue in the future. While droughts have been repeatedly studied in many ecosystems over the last decades, the consequences of increasingly intense, but less frequent rainfall events, on carbon (C) cycling are not well understood. At northern latitudes, peatlands store one third of the terrestrial carbon and their functioning is highly dependent on water. Shifts in rainfall regimes could disrupt peatland C dynamics and speed-up the rates of C loss. How will these immense stocks of C be able to withstand and recover from extreme rainfall? We tested the resistance and resilience effects of extreme precipitation regimes on peatland carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes, pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and litter decomposition rates by exposing intact peat cores to extreme, spring-time rainfall patterns in a controlled mesocosm experiment. We find that more intense but less frequent rainfall destabilized water table dynamics, with cascading effects on peatland C fluxes. Decomposition and respiration rates increased with a deeper mean water table depth (WTD) and larger WTD fluctuations. We observed similar patterns for CO2 uptake, which were likely mediated by improved vascular plant performance. After a three-week recovery period, CO2 fluxes still displayed responses to the earlier WTD dynamics, suggesting lagged effects of precipitation regime shifts. Furthermore, we found that CH4 emissions decreased with deeper mean WTD, but this showed a high resilience once WTD dynamics stabilised. Not only do our results illustrate that shifting rainfall patterns translate in altered WTD dynamics and, consequentially, influence C fluxes, they also demonstrate that exposure to altered rainfall early in the growing season can have lasting effects on CO2 exchange. Even though the increased CO2 assimilation under extreme precipitation patterns signals peatland resistance under changing climatic conditions, it may instead mark the onset of vascular plant encroachment and the associated C loss.

ID MODEL
AB Generalized data on carbon dioxide and methane emission that were obtained from a study of different bog ecosystems in the northern, middle, and southern taiga subzones using a uniform procedure are presented. The average estimates of the CO2 and CH4 contents in the surface atmosphere layer and boo water are given. The main carbon-cycle constituents of the boo ecosystems are scrutinized both for different subzones and for the entire territory of the forest-bog zone. The tendency to sequestering carbon by the West Siberian bogs along the latitudinal-zonal climatic gradient is discussed. The reassimilation of CO2 inside the peat massif is proved experimentally. A new conceptual model of the carbon cycle in surface ecosystems is developed on this basis.

AB Anthropogenic activity is affecting the global climate through the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) e.g. CO2 and CH4. About a third of anthropogenic GHGs are produced from agriculture, including livestock farming and horticulture. A large proportion of the UK's horticultural farming takes place on drained lowland peatlands, which are a source of significant amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. This study set out to establish whether taising the water table from the currently used 50 cm to 30 cm could reduce GHGs emissions from agricultural peatlands, while simultaneously maintaining the current levels of horticultural productivity. A factorial design experiment used agricultural peat soil collected from the Norfolk Fens (among the largest of the UK's lowland peatlands under intensive cultivation) to assess the effects of water table levels, elevated CO2, and agricultural production on GHG fluxes and crop productivity of radish, one of the most economically important fenland crops. The results of this study show that a water table of 30 cm can increase the productivity of the radish crop while also reducing soil CO2 emissions but without a resultant loss of CH4 to the atmosphere, under both ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations. Elevated CO2 increased dry shoot biomass, but not bulb biomass nor root biomass, suggesting no immediate advantage of future CO2 levels to horticultural farming on peat soils. Overall, increasing the water table could make an important contribution to global warming mitigation while not having a detrimental impact on crop yield. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB 1 In a glasshouse experiment we studied the effect of raised CO2 concentration (720 p.p.m.) on CH4 emission at natural boreal peat temperatures using intact cores of boreal peat with living vascular plants and Sphagnum mosses. After the end of the growing season half of the cores were kept unnaturally warm (17-20 degrees C). The potential for CH4 production and oxidation was measured at the end of the emission experiment.
   2 The vascular cores ('Sedge') consisted of a moss layer with sedges, and the moss cores ('Sphagnum') of Sphagnum mosses (some sedge seedlings were removed by cutting). Methane efflux was 6-12 times higher from the Sedge cores than from the Sphagnum cores. The release of CH4 from Sedge cores increased with increasing temperature of the peat and decreased with decreasing temperature. Methane efflux from Sphagnum cores was quite stable independent of the peat temperatures.
   3 In both Sedge and Sphagnum samples, CO2 treatment doubled the potential CH4 production but had no effect on the potential CH4 oxidation. A raised concentration of CO2 increased CH4 efflux weakly and only at the highest peat temperatures (17-20 degrees C).
   4 The results suggest that in cool regions, such as boreal wetlands, temperature would restrict decomposition of the extra substrates probably derived from enhanced primary production of mire vegetation under raised CO2 concentrations, and would thus retard any consequent increase in CH4 emission.

AB We addressed how restoration of forestry-drained peatlands affects CH4-cycling microbes. Despite similar community compositions, the abundance of methanogens and methanotrophs was lower in restored than in natural sites and correlated with CH4 emission. Poor establishment of methanogens may thus explain low CH4 emissions on restored peatlands even 10 to 12 years after restoration.

AB For EOR and EGR in the CCS, CO2 must be captured from large-scale CO2 emission sources like power plants, and transported to depleting oil and gas wells to maintain the reservoir pressure and enhance the recovery rate. To achieve this, CO2 should be transported over long distances from the emission sources of developed countries to oil and gas producing regions by pipeline or ship. Compressed or liquefied CO2 transport ship can be used when pipeline is not recommendable. In case of liquefied CO2 transport ship, the BOG should be treated during sailing using methods such as re-liquefaction and adsorption.
   In the present study, the effects of representative impurities of N-2 and O-2 on the re-liquefaction cycle of liquefied CO2 transport ship were investigated by simulation. The concentration of impurities with boiling points lower than that of CO2 increased much more in the boil-off gas phase than in the liquid phase. This phenomenon led to low cycle performance compared to that of pure CO2 condition, and the decrease rate according to the concentration of the impurities was significant. In the mixture, the discharge pressure of the highest stage in the cycle increased much more than that of the pure CO2 condition, Therefore, when designing re-liquefaction cycle for treating the BOG of liquefied CO2 transport ship, consideration should be given to the effects of impurities on the cycle performance and safety problem in terms of the design pressure. However, impurities did not significantly increase the discharge temperatures of the compressors to such an extent to cause reliability problem of oil degradation in the compressors. With the same composition in the mixture of the liquid phase, nitrogen had a more negative influence than oxygen. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study involved in vitro assays of peat soil to investigate the occurrence, importance and potential mechanism(s) of anaerobic methane oxidation (AOM) in several northern peatlands ranging from ombrotrophic bog to minerotrophic fen. Although strong evidence suggests that AOM is linked to sulfate reduction in marine sediments, very little is known about AOM in freshwater systems such as northern peatlands, which have large methane (CH4) production and are a significant source of atmospheric CH4. Our results showed a mean net AOM rate of 17 +/- 2.6 nmol kg(-1) s(-1) with a maximum rate of 17 +/- 2.6 nmol kg(-1) s(-1) for a minerotrophic fen in central New York. AOM was demonstrated with three independent methods to verify our results: (a) additions of methanogenic inhibitors, (b) stable isotope enrichment (C-13-CH4), and (c) natural abundance stable isotope analysis (C-13-CH4). These experiments confirmed that AOM occurs simultaneously with methanogenesis, consumes a significant portion of gross CH4 production, and significantly fractionates C isotopes (similar to -12%). Experiments using a variety of potential electron acceptors demonstrated that Fe( III) and SO42- are not quantitatively important, while the role of NO3- is uncertain and deserves more attention. The exact mechanism(s) for AOM in peat soils remains unclear; however the AOM rates reported in this study are similar to those reported for CH4 production and aerobic CH4 oxidation in northern peatlands, suggesting that AOM may be an important control on CH4 fluxes in northern peatland ecosystems.

AB Methanogenesis and methane oxidation, fundamental microbial processes in the global carbon cycle, are mediated by numerous factors in terrestrial soil and wetland ecosystems. Accurate quantification of CH4 and CO2 concentrations in soils and wetlands is now possible using membrane inlet mass spectrometry. Below-ground production and headspace exchange of O-2, CO2 and CH4 were monitored in microcosms from an upland Soil (Scotland) and three different peat bog systems (Sweden, Iceland and Scotland) by membrane inlet mass spectrometry. A comparison of cores from the different locations revealed that temperature, soil structure, plant cover and water table level are associated with the regulation of the depth of oxygen available for methanotrophic processes in the oxic zone and therefore gas emission rates. In aerobic soil cores, all the methane produced in anaerobic sites is oxidised rather than being emitted from the soil surface. In peat cores, molar CH4:CO2 ratios of around 1:10 indicate the boundary between the oxic and the anoxic zones. Changes in dissolved gas concentrations with depth and especially the molar CH4:CO2-ratios are discussed. We also demonstrate that inconsistencies in dissolved gas profiles, along with higher localized molar CH4:CO2-ratios, indicate bubble formation at depths greater than 10 cm; gas emission by ebullition was promoted at these sites. Increase in temperature had a particularly strong effect upon gas dynamics in soil and peat cores. Gas solubilities were reduced and elevated CO2 and CH4 emission rates were observed potentially due to increased microbial activity.

AB Liming is a common management practice used to achieve optimum pH for plant growth in agricultural soils. Addition of lime to the soil, however, may Cause CO2 release when the carbonates in lime dissolve in water. Although lime may thereby constitute a significant carbon source, especially under acidic soil conditions, experimental data on the CO2 release are lacking so far. We conducted a split-plot experiment within a cut-away peatland cultivated with a bioenergy crop (reed canary grass, Phalaris arundinacea L) with lime and fertilizer treatments to determine effects of lime on the CO2 emissions from soil and to better understand mechanisms underlying liming effects. Carbon dioxide release was measured over two growing seasons in the field after liming, and complementary laboratory studies were conducted. To differentiate CO2 derived from lime and biotic respiration the delta C-13 of CO2 released was determined and the two-pool mixing model was applied. The results showed that lime may contribute significantly to CO2 release from the soil. In the laboratory, more than 50% of CO2 release was attributable to lime-carbonates during short-term incubation. Lime-derived CO2 emissions were much lower in the field, and were only detected during the first (2-4) months after the application. However, a maximum of 12% of monthly CO2 emissions from the cultivated peatland originated from the lime. Biotic respiration rates were similar in limed and unlimed soils, suggesting that higher pH did not, at least in the short-term, increase carbon losses from cultivated peat soils. Additional fertilization and acidification did not contribute to further CO2 release from the lime. According to our first estimations about one sixth of the lime applied would be released as CO2 from the managed peatland, with all lime-derived emissions occurring during the first year of application (equivalent to about 4.6% of the total annual CO2 losses from the soil in the first year). This suggests that the mass-balance approach as proposed by the IPCC Tier 1 methodology, which assumes that all carbon in lime ends up as CO2 in the atmosphere, overestimates the emissions from lime. Our study further shows that there is a great risk to overestimate heterotrophic microbial activity in limed soils by measuring the CO2 release without separating abiotic and biotic CO2 production.

AB Temperature regime is one of the main controlling factors of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from peat bogs. Remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) has a potential to become an efficient instrument in environmental monitoring of carbon dioxide and methane emissions from peat bogs. This paper examines the relationships between field-measured hydrometeorological variables and MODIS LST data in a hemiboreal raised bog for a period from May to September (2008-2016). The Pearson product-moment correlation was used to reveal the relationship between the field-measured parameters and LST over years and months. A multiple linear regression was chosen to model relationships between the hydrometeorological variables and LST by month. It was found that the relationships between the studied parameters and LST were year- and month-dependent. The main factor of LST was air temperature, and the correlation between LST and air temperature was the strongest during the entire period of study. This study has shown that the hydrometeorological factors of LST can explain 67%-81 % of the variance in LST in a hemiboreal raised bog. The relationships between the hydrometeorological variables and LST may be implemented in more accurate GHG emissions estimation from bogs.

AB Methane emissions from wetlands are highly variable, both spatially and temporally and at scales ranging from microtopographic to regional differences. To comprehend this variation fully and also to predict responses to climate change, an understanding of the intimate linkage between carbon cycling and methane emission in these systems is needed. The presence of vascular plants has been recognized recently as one of the key factors controlling the scale of methane fluxes because it affects processes coupled to transport, production and consumption of methane. A wide area of research has therefore opened up, calling for investigations into details of the impact of vascular plants on methane emissions.

AB Rewetting agricultural peatland abates carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, but the resulting waterlogged anaerobic soil condition may create hotspots of methane (CH4) emissions. In this study, we measured CH4 emissions from side-by-side replicated plots in an agricultural fen cultivated with reed canary grass under a control and two experimental rewetting (i.e., paludiculture) conditions as either continuously flooded to soil surface or semi-flooded where water from the flooded plots intruded from sub-surface. Fluxes were measured for two successive years at 1-2 week intervals (total 59 measurement dates) using static chambers. Annual emissions were estimated by trapezoidal linear interpolation of the measured fluxes between the measurement dates. Two-year time-weighted average ground water tables (GWT) in the flooded, semi-flooded and control plots were 1, 3 and 9 cm below soil surface, respectively. The annual average emissions from flooded plots were 82 and 116 g CH4 m(-2 )yr(-1) in Year 1 and 2, respectively, which were significantly higher than the emissions from semi-flooded plots (35 and 69 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in Year 1 and 2, respectively) and from control plots (3 and 9 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in Year 1 and 2, respectively). Overall, the results showed that the GWT in paludiculture should be maintained few cm below soil surface during high temperature periods to prevent risks of high CH4 emissions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ID SEDIMENTS
AB Methane concentration in dominant landscapes of typical tundra of Western Yamal has been measured. The highest methane content in the active layer was measured in tundra bogs, wet gully bottoms, and polygonal tundra. Within these landscapes, methane concentration reaches 5000 ppm, while in other landscapes it does not exceed 300 ppm. Thus, only bogs, polygonal tundra, and gully bottoms, which occupy approximately 30-40% of the area, are the main sources of methane emission in the typical tundra zone. Measurements of methane emission to the atmosphere have been performed. During the summer maximum of emission, daily methane flux in bogs reaches 14.4 mg/m(2) (20.3 ml/m(2)).

AB Peat accumulating mires are important sources of the greenhouse gas methane. Methane emissions and methanogenic Archaea communities have been shown to differ between fens and bogs, implying that mire succession includes an ecological succession in methanogen communities. We investigated methane production and the methanogen communities along a chronosequence of mires (ca. 100-2500 years), which consisted of five sites (1-5) located on the land-uplift coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. Methane production was measured in a laboratory incubation experiment. Methanogen communities were determined by amplification of a methyl coenzyme M-reductase (mcr) gene marker and analyzed by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting resulted in 15 terminal restriction fragments. The ordination configuration of the terminal restriction fragments data, using nonmetric multidimensional scaling, showed a clear gradient in the methanogen community structure along the mire chronosequence. In addition, fingerprint patterns of samples from the water table level and 40 cm below differed from one another in the bog site (site 5). Methane production was negligible in the three youngest fen sites (sites 1-3) and showed the highest rates in the oligotrophic fen site (site 4). Successful PCR amplification using mcr gene primers revealed the presence of a methanogen community in all five sites along the study transect.

AB An analysis of 1516 radiocarbon dates demonstrates that the development of the current circumarctic peatlands began similar to 16.5 thousand years ago (ka) and expanded explosively between 12 and 8 ka in concert with high summer insolation and increasing temperatures. Their rapid development contributed to the sustained peak in CH4 and modest decline of CO2 during the early Holocene and likely contributed to CH4 and CO2 fluctuations during earlier interglacial and interstadial transitions. Given the decreased tempo of peatland initiation in the late Holocene and the transition of many from fens (which generated high levels of CH4) to ombrotrophic bogs, a neoglacial expansion of northern peatlands cannot explain the increase in atmospheric CH4 that occurred after 6 ka.

AB Dissolved gas concentrations (O-2, CH4, CO2) in peat cores were monitored simultaneously using a fine (1.56 mm diameter) membrane inlet probe connected to a quadrupole mass spectrometer. This technique allows direct measurements at specific locations within the sample with minimal disturbance. Detailed gas profiles in completely waterlogged peat samples (hollows) and samples in which the water table was several cm below the vegetation surface (hummocks) were compared. The depth of the water table played a central role in the distribution of gases. In a hollow, oxygen was present (90 mu M) at the surface but was not detectable (< 0.5 mu M) at depths greater than 2 cm. Concentrations of CH4 and CO2 increased from 6 and 300 mu M respectively at the surface to maxima of 450 and 3900 mu M at 13 cm depth. At a hummock, O-2 and CO2 were present above the water table but CH4, was not detectable. CH4 was measurable 2 cm below the water table. Both CH4 and CO2 concentrations increased with depth but maxima were not attained in the sampled cores.

AB Paddy methane (CH4) production is biologically dominated by methanogenic archaea that metabolize a variety of organic and/or inorganic carbon sources. Though formate is easily dissimilated into H-2/CO2, formate-metabolizing methanogenic archaea are distinct from CO2-utilizing methanogen taxa. The identity of formate metabolizing methanogenic archaea in paddy soil remains elusive. In this investigation, molecular approaches based on stable isotope probing (SIP) technique were conducted to identify the formate-metabolizing methanogenic archaea in paddy soil. CH4 emission monitor, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analyses consistently indicated that some methanogenic archaea metabolized C-13-labeled formate in microcosm and accounted for a large portion of formate-metabolizing archaea in anoxic paddy soil. Phylogenetic identification further found that this guild was affiliated to Methgnabacteriaceae. Taken together Methanobacteriaceae could be the dominant formate-metabolizing methanogenic archaea and play an important role in the CH4 production in paddy soil. These findings would extend the extant knowledge on paddy methanogenic archaea and microbial-driven paddy CH4 emission.

AB Rewetting of agriculturally used peatlands has been proposed as a measure to stop soil subsidence, conserve peat and rehabilitate ecosystem functioning. Unintended consequences might involve nutrient release and changes in the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance towards CH4-dominated emission. To investigate the risks and benefits of rewetting, we subjected soil columns from drained peat- and clay-covered peatlands to different water level treatments: permanently low, permanently inundated and fluctuating (first inundated, then drained). Surface water and soil pore water chemistry, soil-extractable nutrients and greenhouse gas fluxes were measured throughout the experiment. Permanent inundation released large amounts of nutrients into pore water, especially phosphorus (up to 11.7 mg P-PO4 l(-1)) and ammonium (4.8 mg N-NH4 l(-1)). Phosphorus release was larger in peat than in clay soil, presumably due to the larger pool of iron-bound phosphorus in peat. Furthermore, substantial amounts of phosphorus and potassium were exported from the soil matrix to the surface water, risking the pollution of local species-rich (semi-)aquatic ecosystems. Rewetting of both clay and peat soil reduced CO2 emissions. CH4 emissions increased, but, in contrast to the expectations, the fluxes were relatively low. Calculations showed that rewetting reduced net cumulative GHG emissions expressed as CO2 equivalents.

AB The results of studying the carbon dioxide fluxes from the soil's surface during three years taking into account the microrelief are summarized. More precise estimates were obtained for the annual CO2 emission from the oligotrophic peat bogs differing in vegetation and waterlogging in the southern taiga of European Russia. The maximum differences in the rates of the CO2 emission related to the microrelief elements are characteristic of the treeless ridge-pool complex, where the hollows (without vegetation) emitted CO2 twice less than the flat areas and thrice less than the hummocks. In the forest bogs, the differences related to the microrelief were significantly lower. In the areas with the ridge-pool microrelief, the weighted average (for 3 years) CO2 emission was 436 g C/m(2) per year; in the better drained natural dwarf shrub-cotton grass-sphagnum pine forest, 930; and in the drained pine forest, 1292 g C/m(2) per year. The share of the CO2 amount emitted in the cold period (November-April) amounted to 10% of its annual flux from the peat soils of the ridge-pool complex and 17 and 24%, respectively, in the natural and drained pine forests.

AB Methane (CH4) fluxes were measured at 17 peatland sites with different nutritional and hydrological characteristics in the southern and middle boreal zones in Finland by a static chamber technique. Many of the natural peatlands also had counterparts drained for forestry 30-50 years ago. The mean emissions from May to September were 8.0 g CH4 m(-2) for natural ombrogenous bogs and 19.0 g CH4 m(-2) for natural minerogenous fens thus being higher than the 2 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) estimated for the Canadian peatlands. Change in the mean water table level had greater effect on CH4 fluxes on natural fens than on natural bogs. The mean CH4 emissions on drained bogs and fens were 3.9 g CH4 m(-2) and 0.3 g CH4 m(-2), respectively. Some drained fens even had CH4 uptake from the atmosphere. The change in the mean water table had the lowest effect on CH4 fluxes on drained peatlands. The CH4 fluxes on peatlands (natural fens and bogs and drained peatlands) are associated with peat aeration, nutrient level, vegetation cover, peat compaction, peat temperature, and finally with microbial processes responsible for the net release of CH4. We could explain 67% of the variation in mean CH4 fluxes on Finnish peatlands by measuring the mean water table, peat bulk density, and peat pH. The present results can be used to predict the possible changes in CH4 emissions on peatlands if the climate is drying in north. For example, lowering of the present water table by 10 cm would induce a 70% reduction in the CH4 emissions from fens and a 45% reduction from bogs.

AB The ability of peatlands to remove and store atmospheric carbon (C) depends on the drainage characteristics, which can be challenging to accommodate in biogeochemical models. Many studies indicate that restoration (by rewetting) of damaged peatlands can re-establish their capacity as a natural C sink. The purpose of this research was to improve the biogeochemical modelling of peatlands using the ECOSSE process-based model, which will account for the effects of drainage and rewetting during simulation, and potentially contribute towards improved estimation of carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from peatlands, using the IPCC Tier 3 approach. In this study, we present a new drainage factor with seasonal variability Dfa (i) developed specifically for ECOSSE, using empirical data from two drained and rewetted Irish peatlands. Dfa(i) was developed from the Blackwater drained bare-peat site (BWdr), and its application was tested at the vegetated Moyarwood peatland site under drained (MOdr) and rewetted conditions (MOrw). Dfa(i) was applied to the rainfall model inputs for the periods of active drainage in conjunction with the measured water table (WT) inputs. The results indicate that Dfa(i) application can improve the model performance to predict model-estimated water level (WL) and CO2 fluxes under drained conditions [WL: r(2) = 0.89 (BWdr) and 0.94 (Modr); CO2: r(2) = 0.66 (BWdr) and 0.78 (MOdr)] along with model-ability to capture their seasonal trends. The prediction of WL for the rewetted period was less successful at the MOrw site, where the simulation was run for drained to rewetted, which would suggest that additional work on the water model component is still needed. Despite this, the application of Dfa(i) showed successful model simulation of CO2 fluxes at MOrw (r(2) = 0.75) and model ability to capture seasonal trends. This work hopes to positively contribute towards potential future development of Tier 3 methodology for estimating emissions/sinks in peatlands. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We measured methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) exchanges from bare peat and Eriophorum vaginatum ssp. spissum tussocks at recently restored harvested peatlands near Shippagan, New Brunswick and Riviere-du-Loup, Quebec over three growing seasons (May to October). Average seasonal CH4 emission rates ranged from -1 to 65 mg (.) m(-2) (.) d(-1), with a generally weak relationship with water table position. A stronger relationship was seen between CH4 emissions and above-ground plant biomass. CH4 fluxes from E. vaginatum tussocks were larger than those from bare peat surfaces and increased with increasing above-ground biomass and photosynthetic rate. Clipping fresh leaves from tussocks reduced the CH4 emission rates by 79%. Photosynthesis rates were large in tussocks, ranging from 0.9 to 3.4 g CO2-C (.) m(-2) (.) h(-1) at high light levels, and respiration rates (autotrophic + heterotrophic) ranged from -0.1 to -1.3 g CO2-C (.) M-2 (.) h(-1). Some tussocks exhibited net CO2 loss to the atmosphere, even under high light levels. Although the rapid colonization of restored peat surfaces by E. vaginatum aids the development of other vascular plants and mosses, it increases the flux Of CH4 to the atmosphere and provides little or no net C accumulation on the peat surface.

AB Methane (CH4) fluxes in boreal peatlands could be impacted by global warming and N deposition. However, the interaction of these factors remains poorly understood and has not been considered in coupled climate-carbon models. In this study, manipulated warming and N deposition (ammonium nitrate) were conducted for five years in a coastal bog in western Newfoundland, Canada. Consistent with previous studies, warming significantly increased CH4 emission by 52%, which might be due to the increase of microbial activity and vegetation growth. Although N addition alone did not alter CH4 emissions, it significantly reduced the positive effect of warming on CH4 fluxes. We attributed this finding to three possible reasons: (1) N addition caused a shift in root allocation from deep to shallow roots, which decreased labile substrates for CH4 production under warming; (2) warming promoted vegetation uptake of ammonium (NH4+), which alleviated the inhibition of NH4+ to methanotrophs and subsequently increased CH4 oxidation under N addition; and (3) the combination of warming and N addition increased maintenance respiration of vascular plants compared with warming alone, thus reducing net primary production and root exudates for CH4 production. In addition, we found that soil temperature, soil moisture, DOC and TN were the main controls on CH4 fluxes. Our results indicate that the combined effect of N deposition and warming should not be ignored. Otherwise, the emission of CH4 in bogs will be overestimated under future scenarios of climate warming and N deposition increase. Our study can be further applied as empirical evidence for the parameterization of temperature-dependence and nutrient-dependence of CH4 fluxes in biogeochemical models of boreal peatlands.

AB Northern peatlands are important stores of carbon and reservoirs of biodiversity that are vulnerable to global change. However, the carbon dynamics of individual peatland plant species is poorly understood, despite the potential for rising atmospheric CO2 to affect the vegetation's contribution to overall ecosystem carbon function. Here, we examined the effects of 3 years exposure to elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) on (a) peatland plant community composition and biomass, and (b) plant carbon dynamics and the production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) using a (CO2)-C-13 pulse-chase approach. Results showed that under eCO(2), Sphagnum spp. cover declined by 39% (P < 0.05) and Juncus effusus L. cover increased by 40% (P < 0.001). There was a concurrent increase in above- and belowground plant biomass of 115% (P < 0.01) and 96% (P < 0.01), respectively. Vascular species assimilated and turned over more (CO2)-C-13-derived carbon than Sphagnum spp. (49% greater turnover of assimilated C-13 in J. effusus and F. ovina L. leaf tissues compared with Sphagnum, P < 0.01). Elevated CO2 also produced a 66% rise in DOC concentrations (P < 0.001) and an order of magnitude more 'new' exudate (DOC)-D-13 than control samples (24 h after (CO2)-C-13 pulse-labelling 2.5 +/- 0.5 and 0.2 +/- 0.1% in eCO(2) and control leachate, respectively, P < 0.05). We attribute the observed increase in DOC concentrations under eCO(2) to the switch from predominantly Sphagnum spp. to vascular species (namely J. effusus), leading to enhanced exudation and decomposition (litter and peat). The potential for reduced peatland carbon accretion, increased DOC exports and positive feedback to climate change are discussed.

AB Cultivated organic soils are a remarkable source of greenhouse gases (GHG) in many countries. Keeping the ground water table as high as possible could lower the mineralization rate of the peat and thus the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from these soils. We studied the effect of raised water table on the emissions of N2O, CO2 and methane (CH4) from undisturbed peat soil profiles of six different Finnish cultivated organic soils during a 5-week outdoor mesocosm experiment. The aim was to determine an optimum water table that would enable grass cultivation but lower the net gas balance of the soil. Raised water table decreased the GHG emissions from each peat type ranging from weakly decomposed Sphagnum peat to highly humified Carex peat. Based on the results, the optimum water table would be 30 cm below the soil surface. The average reduction of the total net emissions with a raise of water table from a typical drainage depth of 70 to 30 cm was 42 % in the outdoors mesocosm experiment and 23 % at a constant temperature (+6 A degrees C). The emissions of both CO2 and N2O declined and the net consumption of CH4 changed to net production as the water table rose. The results were confirmed by long-term measurements at one of the sampled sites. As a conclusion, we see that promoting drainage systems enabling raising of the ground water table and cultivation of crops capable of producing good yields also in wet conditions would be beneficial for the GHG mitigation in agriculture.

AB Aerobic methane (CH4) oxidation reduces the emission of CH4 from mires and is regulated by various environmental factors. Organic acids and alcohols are intermediates of the anaerobic degradation of organic matter or are released by plant roots. Methanotrophs isolated from mires utilize these compounds preferentially to CH4. Thus, the effect of organic acids and ethanol on CH4 oxidation by methanotrophs of a mire was evaluated. Slurries of mire soil oxidized supplemental CH4 down to subatmospheric concentrations. The dominant pmoA and mmoX genotypes were affiliated with sequences from Methylocystis species capable of utilization of acetate and atmospheric CH4. Soil slurries supplemented with acetate, propionate or ethanol had reduced CH4 oxidation rates compared with unsupplemented or glucose-supplemented controls. Expression of Methylocystis-affiliated pmoA decreased when CH4 consumption decreased in response to acetate and was enhanced after acetate was consumed, at which time the consumption of CH4 reached control levels. The inhibition of methanotroph activity might have been due to either toxicity of organic compounds or their preferred utilization. CH4 oxidation was reduced at 5 and 0.5 mM of supplemental organic compounds. Acetate concentrations may exceed 3 mM in the investigated mire. Thus, the oxidation of CH4 might decrease in microzones where organic acids occur.

AB The conditional sampling method was used to measure methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from peatlands in northern Scotland. Preliminary data were obtained using a simple system. Subsequent automation made continuous nux-measurements possible. Observed CH4 fluxes were in the range -70 to +110 mu mol m(-2)h(-1) with a mean flux of 23 mu mol m(-2)h(-1). Peak photosynthetic CO2 fluxes were in the range -10 to -30 mmol m(-2) h(-1). Nocturnal respiration ranged from 0 to +10 mmol m(-2) h(-1). The conditional sampling observations showed reasonable agreement with measurements of flux by eddy-covariance, gradient and aircraft methods. Error analyses and laboratory tests were conducted to determine the precision of the flux-measurement system. The dominant error was associated with the determination of the mixing-ratio difference in conditionally-sampled updraught and downdraught air. The standard error of the difference for CH4 was typically 0.15 ng g(-1) (0.3 parts in 10(9) (p.p.b.))using a careful high-repetition sampling strategy with a modified gas chromatographic/flame ionization detector system. Under typical daytime atmospheric conditions this corresponded to a standard error in the flux measurement of 10 mu mol m(-2)h(-1), which is consistent with field observations. The empirical beta factor in the conditional sampling equation was found to be insensitive to changes in turbulence intensity and atmospheric stability. Simple upscaling models were used to estimate annual carbon-fluxes to Great Britain's peatlands of -0.5 Mt of carbon in the form of CO2 and 18 kt in the form of methane.

AB Peatland restoration by inundation of drained areas can alter local greenhouse gas emissions as CO2 and CH4. Factors that can influence these emissions include the quality and amount of substrates available for anaerobic degradation processes and the sources and availability of electron acceptors. In order to learn about possible sources of high CO2 and CH4 emissions from a rewetted degraded fen grassland, we performed incubation experiments that tested the effects of fresh plant litter in the flooded peats on pore water chemistry and CO2 and CH4 production and emission.
   The position in the soil profile of the pre-existing drained peat substrate affected initial rates of anaerobic CO2 production subsequent to flooding, with the uppermost peat layer producing the greatest specific rates of CO2 evolution. CH4 production rates depended on the availability of electron acceptors and was significant only when sulfate concentrations were reduced in the pore waters. Very high specific rates of both CO2 (maximum of 412 mg Cd-1 kg(-1) C) and CH4 production (788 mg Cd-1 kg(-1) C) were observed in a new sediment layer that accumulated over the 2.5 years since the site was flooded. This new sediment layer was characterized by overall low C content, but represented a mixture of sand and relatively easily decomposable plant litter from reed canary grass killed by flooding. Samples that excluded this new sediment layer but included intact roots remaining from flooded grasses had specific rates of CO2 (max. 28 mg Cd-1 kg(-1) C) and CH4 (max. 34 mg Cd-1 kg(-1) C) production that were 10-20 times lower than for the new sediment layer and were comparable to those of a newly flooded upper peat layer. Lowest rates of anaerobic CO2 and CH4 production (range of 4-8 mg Cd-1 kg(-1) C and <1 mg C d(-1) kg(-1) C) were observed when all fresh organic matter sources (plant litter and roots) were excluded. In conclusion, the presence of fresh organic substrates such as plant and root litter originating from plants killed by inundation has a high potential for CH4 production, whereas peat without any fresh plant-derived material is relatively inert. Significant anaerobic CO2 and CH4 production in peat only occurs when some labile organic matter is available, e.g. from remaining roots or root exudates.

AB Peatlands are the significant source of atmospheric methane (CH4), which is produced during peat accumulation. In this study, we investigated CH4 emissions over two growing seasons from a Carex lasiocarpa-dominated peatland in the Sanjiang Plain in China using the static chamber technique. We also investigated the environmental factors controlling emissions during the two years of study, 2012 and 2013. CH4 emissions ranged from 0.07 to 56.01 mg CH4-C m(-2) h(-1) with mean values of 7.33 +/- 1.65 mg C m(-2) h(-1), showing significant temporal patterns in both years with peak values in early June and middle August respectively. Variations in water table, soil temperature at 25 cm depth and soil's water-filled pore space together explained 66.7% of the observed temporal variation of CH4 fluxes by the step-wise regression. Rapid and short-lived precipitation events might have no immediate influence on CH4 emissions, which primarily depended on the actual soil aeration and moisture conditions. A simple relationship between single parameter and CH4 fluxes would be overruled once the water table dropped below the critical threshold for CH4 release. The amount of CH4 emitted from the herbaceous peatland in the Sanjiang Plain during the growing season was about 6.93 x 10(12) mg C. Our results suggested that the herbaceous peatland in the Sanjiang Plain is an important source of atmospheric CH4. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands are large natural sources of atmospheric methane (CH4). While many studies have measured CH4 emissions to the atmosphere, less is known about the stock and residence time of subsurface CH4. In this study we examined dissolved CH4 concentration in near-surface peatland pore waters of a poor fen near Quebec City, Canada, in order to (1) investigate the variability in and potential controls on these concentrations and (2) combine measured dissolved CH4 concentration with estimated bubble CH4 stock and measured CH4 fluxes to estimate the mean residence time of subsurface CH4. Concentrations ranged from 1 to 450 mu M during both study seasons. Depth profiles were generally consistent at one location within the peatland throughout the sampling period but varied between locations. Patterns with depth were not well correlated to pore water pH or EC; however, changes in CH4 concentration through time in the upper 30 cm were related to temperature and water table at some locations. Depth profiles taken at 2- to 5-cm intervals revealed discrete concentration "spikes'' which were often maintained throughout the season and are likely related to bubble CH4 dynamics. Estimated subsurface CH4 stocks indicate that even when relatively low bubble volume (5% of peat volume) is assumed, bubble CH4 accounted for greater than half of total stocks. Calculated mean residence times were 28-120 days. This implies that CH4 flux may lag changes in water table and temperature which happen on shorter timescales (hours or days). To improve our description of subsurface CH4 stocks, links between dissolved and bubble CH4 stocks and peatland CH4 residence time, coincident measurement of pore water CH4 concentrations, entrapped gas content and composition, diffusive CH4 flux, and ebullition are required.

AB Methane is a greenhouse gas having well-known impacts on global radiative forcing. However, understanding the dynamics and thresholds of methane formation in peatlands, which undergo cyclic aeration and anoxia, is currently limited even though it is crucial for reliable estimation of methane emission to the atmosphere. The purpose of this study was to estimate the optimal range and thresholds of aeration conditions, which impact methane formation in upper layers of peat originating from a natural fen (East Poland). The experiment was conducted under laboratory conditions on two groups of differently treated soils which were incubated at field water capacity. One group was incubated in air and another in helium, both at temperatures of 5, 10 and 20 A degrees C. Direct soil aeration estimation included measurements of redox potential and oxygen diffusion rate. The latter was used for the first time as an indicator of methane formation in soil. Both the aerated and anoxic groups showed that methane formation took place at ODR of below 20 mu g O-2 m(-2) s(-1) and Eh of below +240 mV which are the higher threshold levels for methanogenesis than previously reported. Maximum methanogenic activity amounted up to 71.86 mg CH4 kgDW(-1) d(-1). Aeration was capable of reducing this methanogenic activity by 28-100 %. Decreasing temperatures and aeration increased the time until the initiation of CH4 production (p < 0.05, n = 72).

AB Although Sphagnum (moss)-dominated, northern peatland ecosystems harbor methane (CH4)-producing microorganisms (methanogens) and are a significant source of atmospheric CH4, rates of CH4 production vary widely among different systems. Very little work has been done to examine whether concentrations of cations and metal elements may account for the variability. We examined rates of CH4 production in peat from five geographically and functionally disparate Sphagnum-dominated peatlands by incubating peat samples in vitro with and without additions of trace metals (Fe, Ni, Co) and base cations (Ca, Li, Na). In peat from the most mineral poor sites, the addition of metals and Na enhanced CH4 production beyond that observed in controls. The same treatments in mineral rich sites yielded no effect or an inhibition of CH4 production. None of the treatments affected anaerobic respiration, measured as CO2 production, in the in vitro incubations of peat, except added citrate, suggesting that methanogens, and not the entire anaerobic community, can be limited by the availability of metal elements and cations.

AB Eutrophication of peatlands may have significant effects on emissions of carbon dioxide and methane. This study analyses the effects of nitrogen (28.7 mmol NH4+-N, N), phosphorus (1.78 mmol PO43--P, P) and glucose (2.79 mmol glucose, G) additions on CO2 and CH4 emission from intact soil cores from a Carex-dominated peatland in the Netherlands. The cores (taken from the upper 10cm of the peat profile) were brought to field capacity and aerobically incubated at 20 degrees C for 6 wk. Nutrients were added in the following combinations: 0 (unfertilized control), N, P, NP, G,NG, PG, NPG. All treatments in which glucose was present (G, NG, PG, NPG) stimulated CO2 emission during the first 2 wk of the experiment, but did not lead to increased decay of organic matter. At the end of the experiment, all treatments which included N (N, NG, NP, NPG) showed reduced CO2 emission. This was probably due to pH effects, because the pH in the N fertilized treatments was 0.4-0.8 units lower than in the unfertilized control. Cumulative CO2 emission in the N treatment was lower than in the control, but in the treatments where glucose was added it was higher. There was no effect of P addition on CO2 emission. In all treatments, cumulative CH4 emission was higher than in the control due to an initial stimulation of CH4 emission. Compared within treatments, cumulative CO2-C emission was 35-164 times higher than cumulative CH4-C emission. From these observations we conclude that increased amounts of NH4+-N supply lead to reduction of decay of organic matter in peat soils and thereby to a reduction of gaseous carbon loss from these soils. Nutrient or glucose additions lead only to a short-term increase in methane emissions from peat soils. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Polygonal peatlands are carbon-rich permafrost ecosystems that will likely be significantly affected by climate change. However, studies are often constrained to one measurement per day, which impedes assessments of the temporal variability in carbon fluxes. For this reason, we measured ecosystem respiration (ER) of CO2 in a polygonal peatland underlain by continuous permafrost over an entire growing season to determine the effects of temperature and water table depth on the temporal variability of ER. We used four automated closed chambers to measure ER under varying temperature and soil moisture regimes. Temporal variability was approximately the same for the four plots, on both a diurnal and a seasonal scale. Both diurnal and seasonal variations in ER were strongly controlled by changes in soil surface temperature. Fluctuations of the water table depth associated with important rainfall events was also an important factor affecting ER on the seasonal scale. We found that water table level fluctuations below 20-25 cm did not significantly affect ER and that most soil respiration took place in the top 10 cm, likely in the surface 2 cm. Our results highlight the importance of monitoring future changes in tundra hydrology, which will determine the depth of organic matter available for aerobic decomposition.

AB Land-use changes have contributed to increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Conversion from natural peatlands to agricultural land has led to widespread subsidence of the peat surface caused by soil compaction and mineralization. To study the net ecosystem exchange of carbon (C) and the contribution of respiration to peat subsidence, eddy covariance measurements were made over pasture on a well-developed, drained peat soil from 22 May 2002 to 21 May 2003. The depth to the water table fluctuated between 0.02 m in winter 2002 to 0.75 m during late summer and early autumn 2003. Peat soil moisture content varied between 0.6 and 0.7 m(3) m(-3) until the water table dropped below 0.5 m, when moisture content reached 0.38 m(3) m(-3). Neither depth to water table nor soil moisture was found to have an effect on the rate of night-time respiration (ranging from 0.4-8.0 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in winter and summer, respectively). Most of the variance in night-time respiration was explained by changes in the 0.1 m soil temperature (r(2)=0.93). The highest values for daytime net ecosystem exchange were measured in September 2002, with a maximum of -17.2 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Grazing events and soil moisture deficiencies during a short period in summer reduced net CO2 exchange. To establish an annual C balance for this ecosystem, non-linear regression was used to model missing data. Annually integrated (CO2) C exchange for this peat-pasture ecosystem was 45 +/- 500 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). After including other C exchanges (methane emissions from cows and production of milk), the net annual C loss was 1061 +/- 500 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1).

AB In northeastern Canada, at the ecotonal limit of the forest tundra and lichen woodland, a rise of the regional water table in the peatland systems was registered since Little Ice Age resulting in increasing pool compartment at the expense of terrestrial surfaces. We hypothesized that, with a mean water table closer to peat surface and higher pool density, these ecosystems would be great CH4 emitters. In summers 2009 and 2010, methane fluxes were measured in a patterned fen located in the northeastern portion of the La Grande river watershed to determine the contribution of the different microforms (lawns, hollows, hummocks, string, pools) to the annual CH4 budget. Mean seasonal CH4 fluxes from terrestrial microforms ranged between 12.9 and 49.4 mg m(-2) day(-1) in 2009 and 15.4 and 47.3 mg m(-2) day(-1) in 2010. Pool fluxes (which do not include ebullition fluxes) ranged between 102.6 and 197.6 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) in 2009 and 76.5 and 188.1 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) in 2010. Highest fluxes were measured in microforms with water table closer to peat surface but no significant relationship was observed between water table depth and CH4 fluxes. Spatially weighted CH4 budget demonstrates that, during the growing season, the studied peatland emitted 66 +/- A 31 in 2009 and 55 +/- A 26 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) in 2010, 79 % of which is accounted by pool fluxes. In a context where climate projections predict greater precipitations in northeastern Canada, these results indicate that this type of peatlands could contribute to modify the methane balance in the atmosphere.

AB Drained peatlands are significant hotspots of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and may also be more vulnerable to fire with its associated gaseous emissions. Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from peatlands managed for extraction are reported on an annual basis. However, the Tier 1 (default) emission factors (EFs) provided in the IPCC 2013 Wetlands Supplement for this land use category may not be representative in all cases and countries are encouraged to move to higher-tier reporting levels with reduced uncertainty levels based on country- or regional-specific data. In this study, we quantified (1) CO2-C emissions from nine peat extraction sites in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, which were initially disaggregated by land use type (industrial versus domestic peat extraction), and (2) a range of GHGs that are released to the atmosphere with the burning of peat. Drainage-related methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions as well as CO2-C emissions associated with the off-site decomposition of horticultural peat were not included here. Our results show that net CO2-C emissions were strongly controlled by soil temperature at the industrial sites (bare peat) and by soil temperature and leaf area index at the vegetated domestic sites. Our derived EFs of 1.70 (+/-0.47) and 1.64 (+/-0.44) tCO(2)-C ha(-1) yr(-1) for the industrial and domestic sites respectively are considerably lower than the Tier 1 EF (2.8 +/- 1.7t CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1)) provided in the Wetlands Supplement. We propose that the difference between our derived values and the Wetlands Supplement value is due to differences in peat quality and, consequently, decomposition rates. Emissions from burning of the peat (gkg(-1) dry fuel burned) were estimated to be approximately 1346 CO2, 8.35 methane (CH4), 218 carbon monoxide (CO), 1.53 ethane (C2H6), 1.74 ethylene (C2H4), 0.60 methanol (CH3OH), 2.21 hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and 0.73 ammonia (NH3), and this emphasises the importance of understanding the full suite of trace gas emissions from biomass burning. Our results highlight the importance of generating reliable Tier 2 values for different regions and land use categories. Furthermore, given that the IPCC Tier 1 EF was only based on 20 sites (all from Canada and Fennoscandia), we suggest that data from another 9 sites significantly expand the global data set, as well as adding a new region.

AB Understanding the climatic and biological factors that regulate soil carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux is crucial in peatlands because they contain a large proportion of terrestrial carbon (C). We predicted that rainfall reduction would increase soil CO2 efflux, and that cessation of below-ground allocation of recent plant assimilate would reduce soil CO2 efflux. These predictions were tested in the field using rainfall shelters that allowed a maximum of 40 % of rainfall onto 2 x 2 m plots by diverting rainwater from the shelter roofs with guttering, and by girdling stems of the dominant plant, Calluna vulgaris, for two years. We also used (CO2)-C-13-pulse labelling of intact monoliths at ambient CO2 concentrations to trace recent assimilate from plant shoots to roots, bulk soil, leachate, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and soil CO2 efflux. Soil CO2 efflux in the sheltered plots increased in Year 1 but not in Year 2, and we found a positive relationship between soil CO2 efflux and water table depth. Our data indicate that lowering the water table below a critical threshold (15-20 cm) affects soil CO2 efflux. Girdling of C. vulgaris shoots resulted in no measurable reduction in soil CO2 efflux, while only similar to 3 % of C-13 fixed by shoots was recovered in soil CO2 efflux and DOC in the 20 days after labelling. Our findings show that below-ground allocation of recent assimilate from C. vulgaris plants > 6 years old has little impact on soil CO2 efflux.

AB Northern peatlands store similar to 30% of the global soil carbon, despite covering only 3% of the land. To understand the carbon balance of these systems and predict their response to changes in climate, robust and reliable models are needed. The McGill Wetland Model (MWM), originally developed to simulate the carbon dynamics of ombrotrophic bogs, was modified to simulate the CO2 biogeochemistry of sedge-dominated oligotrophic minerogenic peatlands, a prominent peatland type in boreal and subarctic landscapes. Three modifications were implemented: (1) a function to describe the impact of soil moisture on the optimal gross primary production, (2) a scheme to partition the peat profile into oxic and anoxic compartments based on the effective root depth as a function of daily sedge net primary production, and (3) a function to describe the fen moss water dynamics. The modified MWM was evaluated using eddy-covariance net ecosystem production (NEP) from Degero Stormyr in northern Sweden. The root mean square error for daily NEP was similar to 0.46g C m(-2) d(-1), and the index of agreement was 84%. This model adequately captures the magnitude and direction of the CO2 fluxes and simulates the seasonal and inter-annual variability reasonably well (r(2)>0.8). Sensitivity analysis confirms that specifically water table depth (WTD) and moss water content are key biogeochemical hydrology processes for the carbon biogeochemistry of a sedge-dominated oligotrophic minerogenic peatland. An increase of WTD by 15cm or air temperature by 3 degrees C could decrease NEP by up to 200% and make the peatland become a source of CO2.

AB Wetlands are important sources of globally emitted methane. Plants mediate much of that emission by releasing root-derived organic carbon, including formate, a direct precursor of methane. Thus, the objective of this study was to resolve formate-driven processes potentially linked to methanogenesis in the fen root-zone. Although, formate was anticipated to directly trigger methanogenesis, the rapid anaerobic consumption of formate by Carex roots unexpectedly yielded H-2 and CO2 via enzymes such as formate-H-2-lyase (FHL), and likewise appeared to enhance the utilization of organic carbon. Collectively, 57 [FeFe]- and [NiFe]-hydrogenase-containing family level phylotypes potentially linked to FHL activity were detected. Under anoxic conditions, root-derived fermentative Citrobacter and Hafnia isolates produced H-2 from formate via FHL. Formate-derived H-2 fueled methanogenesis and acetogenesis, and methanogenic (Methanoregula, Methanobacterium, Methanocella) and acetogenic (Acetonema, Clostridum, Sporomusa) genera potentially linked to these hydrogenotrophic activities were identified. The findings (i) provide novel insights on highly diverse rootassociated FHL-containing taxa that can augment secondary hydrogenotrophic processes via the production of formate-derived H-2, (ii) demonstrate that formate can have a 'priming' effect on the utilization of organic carbon, and (iii) raise questions regarding the fate of formate-derived H-2 when it diffuses away from the root-zone.

AB The greenhouse-gas (GHG) balance of CH4 and N2O emissions and CO2 respiration in peatlands plays a key role in climate change. A GHG balance is mostly calculated from point measurements. In this study we propose and test a geophysical method of low frequency domain electromagnetic method (FDEM) as a proxy for forest-floor CO2 respiration and CH4 emissions in two 50 x 100 m drained peatlands in Estonia: a Downy birch and a Scots pine stand from April to September 2015. The FDEM measurement campaign in September 2015 yielded a detailed map of topsoil electrical conductivity. We explain the predictive power of FDEM on GHG emissions through relationships with dry bulk density of soil. Although we over- or underestimated some fluxes owing to soil heterogeneity, we composed reasonably credible GHG emission maps. The initial results seem promising and we recommend further application of FDEM methods. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Functional traits mechanistically capture plant responses to environmental gradients as well as plant effects on ecosystem functioning. Yet most trait-based theory stems from terrestrial systems and extension to other habitats can provide new insights.
   2. Wetlands differ from terrestrial systems in conditions (e.g. soil water saturation, anoxia, pH extremes), plant adaptations (e.g. aerenchyma, clonality, ubiquity of bryophytes) and important processes (e.g. denitrification, peat accumulation, methane emission). Wetland plant adaptations and trait (co-)variation can be situated along major plant trait trade-off axes (e.g. the resource economics spectrum), but soil saturation represents a complex stress gradient beyond a simple extension of commonly studied water availability gradients.
   3. Traits that affect ecosystem functioning overlap with patterns in terrestrial systems. But wetland-specific traits that mediate plant effects on soil redox conditions, microbial communities and on water flow, as well as trait spectra of mosses, vary among wetland types.
   4. Synthesis. With increasing availability of quantitative plant traits a trait-based ecology of wetlands is emerging, with the potential to advance process-based understanding and prediction. We provide an interactive cause-and-effect framework that may guide research efforts to disentangle the multiple interacting processes involved in scaling from environmental conditions to ecosystem functioning via plant communities.

AB Carbon dynamics of temperate peat swamps are a largely understudied component of wetland carbon cycling. Under a changing climate, hydrometeorological conditions may change, and understanding how peat swamps may be impacted is important. We investigated the importance of hydrogeomorphic setting on controlling soil carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes from a temperate peat swamp in southern Ontario, Canada over a 3-year period. We chose three different hydrogeomorphic settings: (a) a site with strong wetland-stream interactions (i.e., an unconfined stream channel; unconfined), (b) a site with limited wetland-stream interactions (confined), and (c) an interior site (no wetland-stream interaction). The differing hydrogeomorphic conditions between the sites resulted in differences in carbon fluxes. The unconfined site maintained a higher water table across all three study years, providing conditions that are not favourable to CO2 production. The confined and interior sites sustained a much lower water table, with conditions more conducive to CO2 efflux. The unconfined site also had the highest CH4 emissions due to the increased anoxic conditions favourable for CH4 production as a result of the higher water table position. Hydrogeomorphic setting was found to be important for understanding within site variation, suggesting the sites may respond differently to longer-term shifts in environmental conditions. This may change relationships between sites if the responses are strong enough to significantly alter carbon fluxes, decomposition, and potential peat accumulation rates. It is important to understand the locally specific responses to environmental conditions within peat swamp ecosystems, in order to make future predictions about whole ecosystem function under changing conditions.

AB Sphagnum peatlands are important ecosystems in the methane cycle. Methanotrophs living inside the dead hyaline cells or on the Sphagnum mosses are able to act as a methane filter and thereby reduce methane emissions. We investigated in situ methane concentrations and the corresponding activity and diversity of methanotrophs in different Sphagnum dominated bog microhabitats. In contrast to the Northern Hemisphere peat ecosystems the temperate South American peat bogs are dominated by one moss species; Sphagnum magellanicum. This permitted a species-independent comparison of the different bog microhabitats. Potential methane oxidizing activity was found in all Sphagnum mosses sampled and a positive correlation was found between activity and in situ methane concentrations. Substantial methane oxidation activity (23 mu mol CH4 gDW(-1) day(-1)) was found in pool mosses and could be correlated with higher in situ methane concentrations (>35 mu mol CH4 l(-1) pore water). Little methanotrophic activity (< 0.5 mu mol CH4 gDW(-1) day(-1)) was observed in living Sphagnum mosses from lawns and hummocks. Methane oxidation activity was relatively high (>4 mu mol CH4 gDW(-1) day(-1)) in Sphagnum litter at depths around the water levels and rich in methane. The total bacterial community was studied using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the methanotrophic communities were studied using a pmoA microarray and a complementary pmoA clone library. The methanotrophic diversity was similar in the different habitats of this study and comparable to the methanotrophic diversity found in peat mosses from the Northern Hemisphere. The pmoA microarray data indicated that both alpha-and gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs were present in all Sphagnum mosses, even in those mosses with a low initial methane oxidation activity. Prolonged incubation of Sphagnum mosses from lawn and hummock with methane revealed that the methanotrophic community present was viable and showed an increased activity within 15 days. The high abundance of methanotrophic Methylocystis species in the most active mosses suggests that these might be responsible for the bulk of methane oxidation.

AB We measured methane fluxes of a patterned bog situated in Siikaneva in southern Finland from six different plant community types in three growing seasons (2012-2014) using the static chamber method with chamber exposure of 35 min. A mixed-effects model was applied to quantify the effect of the controlling factors on the methane flux.
   The plant community types differed from each other in their water level, species composition, total leaf area (LAI(TOT)) and leaf area of aerenchymatous plant species (LAI(AER)). Methane emissions ranged from -309 to 1254 mg m(-2) d(-1). Although methane fluxes increased with increasing peat temperature, LAI(TOT) and LAI(AER), they had no correlation with water table or with plant community type. The only exception was higher fluxes from hummocks and high lawns than from high hummocks and bare peat surfaces in 2013 and from bare peat surfaces than from high hummocks in 2014. Chamber fluxes upscaled to ecosystem level for the peak season were of the same magnitude as the fluxes measured with the eddy covariance (EC) technique. In 2012 and in August 2014 there was a good agreement between the two methods; in 2013 and in July 2014, the chamber fluxes were higher than the EC fluxes.
   Net fluxes to soil, indicating higher methane oxidation than production, were detected every year and in all community types. Our results underline the importance of both LAI(AER) and LAI(TOT) in controlling methane fluxes and indicate the need for automatized chambers to reliably capture localized events to support the more robust EC method.

AB 1. A valid strategy to mitigate the eutrophication of water bodies due to non-point source phosphorus (P) pollution and to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases is the rewetting of degraded peatlands. However, long-term drainage and intensive agricultural use make it unlikely that the original sink functions for nutrients and carbon (C) as well as low-nutrient conditions can be re-established within a human time perspective.
   2. We hypothesized that the removal of the upper degraded peat layer can be a suitable measure to avoid the negative implications of excess mobilization of P and C after rewetting. To evaluate the effect of top soil removal (TSR) we performed lab and field experiments in six inundated peatlands in northern Germany without TSR compared to six inundated sites with TSR. In addition, we included data from a rewetted peatland where the degraded peat had been removed from about half of the area and groundwater level was just beneath the soil surface.
   3. The results emphasized that following inundation newly formed detritus mud layers overlying the former peat surface are the dominating source for P and methane in particular in sites without TSR but also in sites with TSR, although at significantly lower rates. Although highly decomposed peat released more or less no methane, dissolved organic matter mobilization was highest in this substrate while less decomposed peat was characterized in general by lowest rates of mobilization.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Top soil removal prior to rewetting can be a suitable method to avoid the negative consequences of the excess release of phosphorus (P) and carbon post-rewetting. We developed a simple decision support schematic to assist the peatland restoration process and to better understand the implications of top soil removal. Despite the potential benefits, top soil removal should not be declared as a universal method, as it requires detailed consideration prior to application. However, this and other research demonstrate that it is inevitable that without any further management interventions high mobilization of P, dissolved organic matter and methane may persist for centuries following rewetting of peatlands.

AB Drainage turns peatlands from natural carbon sinks into hotspots of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from soils due to alterations in hydrological and biogeochemical processes. As a consequence of drainage-induced mineralisation and anthropogenic sand addition, large areas of former peatlands under agricultural use have soil organic carbon (SOC) contents at the boundary between mineral and organic soils. Previous research has shown that the variability of GHG emissions increases with anthropogenic disturbance. However, how and whether sand addition affects GHG emissions remains a controversial issue. The aim of this long-term incubation experiment was to assess the influence of hydrological and biogeochemical soil properties on emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Strongly degraded peat with sand addition (peat-sand mixtures) and without sand addition (earthified peat) was systematically compared under different moisture conditions for fen and bog peat. Soil columns originating from both the topsoil and the subsoil of ten different peatlands under grassland use were investigated. Over a period of six months the almost saturated soil columns were drained stepwise via suction to -300 hPa. The CO2 fluxes were lowest at water-saturated and dry soil moisture conditions, resulting in a parabolic dependence of CO2 fluxes on the water-filled pore space (WFPS) peaking at 56-92% WFPS. The highest N2O fluxes were found at between 73 and 95% WFPS. Maximum CO2 fluxes were highest from topsoils, ranging from 21 to 77 mg C m(-2) h(-1), while the maximum CO2 fluxes from subsoils ranged from 3 to 14 mg C m(-2) h(-1). No systematic influence of peat type or sand addition on GHG emissions was found in topsoils, but CO2 fluxes from subsoils below peat-sand mixtures were higher than from subsoils below earthified peat. Maximum N2O fluxes were highly variable between sites and ranged from 18.5 to 234.9 and from 0.2 to 22.9 mu g N m-2 h-1 for topsoils and subsoils, respectively. CH4 fluxes were negligible even under water-saturated conditions. The highest GHG emissions occurred at a WFPS that relates - under equilibrium conditions - to a water table of 20-60 cm below the surface in the field. High maximum CO2 and N2O fluxes were linked to high densities of plant-available phosphorus and potassium. The results of this study highlight that nutrient status plays a more important role in GHG emissions than peat type or sand addition, and do not support the idea of peat-sand mixtures as a mitigation option for GHG emissions.

AB Wetlands can either be net sinks or net sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs), depending on the mean annual water level and other factors like average annual temperature, vegetation development, and land use. Whereas drained and agriculturally used peatlands tend to be carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) sources but methane (CH4) sinks, restored (i.e. rewetted) peatlands rather incorporate CO2, tend to be N2O neutral and release CH4. One of the aims of peatland restoration is to decrease their global warming potential (GWP) by reducing GHG emissions.
   We estimated the greenhouse gas exchange of a peat bog restoration sequence over a period of 2 yr (1 July 2007-30 June 2009) in an Atlantic raised bog in northwest Germany. We set up three study sites representing different land use intensities: intensive grassland (deeply drained, mineral fertilizer, cattle manure and 4-5 cuts per year); extensive grassland (rewetted, no fertilizer or manure, up to 1 cutting per year); near-natural peat bog (almost no anthropogenic influence). Daily and annual greenhouse gas exchange was estimated based on closed-chamber measurements. CH4 and N2O fluxes were recorded bi-weekly, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) measurements were carried out every 34 weeks. Annual sums of CH4 and N2O fluxes were estimated by linear interpolation while NEE was modelled.
   Regarding GWP, the intensive grassland site emitted 564 +/- 255 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) and 850 +/- 238 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) in the first (2007/2008) and the second (2008/2009) measuring year, respectively. The GWP of the extensive grassland amounted to -129 +/- 231 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) and 94 +/- 200 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1), while it added up to 45 +/- 117 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) and -101 +/- 93 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) in 2007/08 and 2008/09 for the near-natural site. In contrast, in calendar year 2008 GWP aggregated to 441 +/- 201 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1), 14 +/- 162 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) and 31 +/- 75 gCO(2)-C equivalents m(-2) yr(-1) for the intensive grassland, extensive grassland, and near-natural site, respectively.
   Despite inter-annual variability, rewetting contributes considerably to mitigating GHG emission from formerly drained peatlands. Extensively used grassland on moderately drained peat approaches the carbon sequestration potential of near-natural sites, although it may oscillate between being a small sink and being a small source depending on inter-annual climatic variability.

AB The rewetting of drained peatlands is currently a common practice for re-establishing near-natural hydrological conditions and for reducing peatland greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), which are enhanced under peatland drainage and extraction. In the originally bare and drained peatland Himmelmoor (Quickborn, Germany), the rewetting process started stepwise in 2004 by blocking drainage ditches with peat as well as by creating polders surrounded by peat dams. In this research we examined differences in CO2, methane (CH4) and N2O emissions between a flooded (FL) area, a bare peat dam (PD) area and an abandoned (but still drained) extraction (E) area during a period in 2012 and during a period of two years in 2014-2016. The results showed that all study areas were GHG sources, although large differences were identified between the different sites. Winter CO2 emissions from all sites (FL, PD, E) were within the range previously reported for rewetted peatlands, but summer CO2 emissions from PD (1-20 mu mol m(-1) s(-1)) strongly exceeded the reported average range for similar surfaces. Very low and irregular CH4 fluxes were detected at both PD and FL, ranging from -6 to 24 nmol m(-2) s(-1) at PD and from -13 to 49 nmol m(-2) s(-1) at FL. In comparison to other peatlands, the observed N2O emissions were high, especially at the PD sites with maximum daily means of 23 nmol m(-2)s(-1) in the summer of 2012. In general, the flooded excavation sites (FL) showed lower GHG emissions than the not-rewetted excavation area (E). Also, despite the relatively small coverage of the peat dams (PD), these areas showed a larger total GHG emission than the E and FL sites. This negative effect of peat dams during the first years after flooding could be mitigated by stimulating their colonisation by moss or heath vegetation, which reduces the soil N pool and thus can be expected to reduce N2O fluxes from the peat dams.

AB [1] Peatlands are widely regarded as a significant source of atmospheric CH4, a potent greenhouse gas. At present, most of the information on environmental emissions of CH4 comes from infrequent, temporally discontinuous ground-based flux measurements. Enormous efforts have been made to extrapolate measured emission rates to establish seasonal or annual averages using relevant biogeochemical factors, such as water table positions or peat temperatures, by assuming that the flux was stationary during a substantial nonsampling period. However, this assumption has not been explicitly verified, and little is known about the continuous variation of the CH4 flux in a timescale of individual flux measurement. In this study, we show an abrupt change in the CH4 emission rate associated with falling atmospheric pressure. We found that the CH4 flux can change by 2 orders of magnitude within a matter of tens of minutes owing to the release of free-phase CH4 triggered by a drop in air pressure. The contribution of the ebullition to the total CH4 flux during the measurements was significant (50 - 64%). These results clearly indicated that field campaigns must be designed to cover this rapid temporal variability caused by ebullition, which may be especially important in intemperate weather. Process- based CH4 emission models should also be modified to include air pressure as a key factor for the control of ebullient CH4 release from peatland.

AB Methane (CH4) oxidation is an important process for regulating CH4 emissions from peatlands as it oxidizes CH4 to carbon dioxide (CO2). Our current knowledge about its temporal dynamics and contribution to ecosystem CO2 fluxes is, however, limited due to methodological constraints. Here, we present the first results from a novel method for quantifying in-situ CH4 oxidation at high temporal resolution. Using an automated chamber system, we measured the isotopic signature of heterotrophic respiration (CO2 emissions from vegetation-free plots) at a boreal mire in northern Sweden. Based on these data we calculated CH4 oxidation rates using a two-source isotope mixing model. During the measurement campaign, 74% of potential CH4 fluxes from vegetation-free plots were oxidized to CO2, and CH4 oxidation contributed 20 +/- 2.5% to heterotrophic respiration corresponding to 10 +/- 0.5% of ecosystem respiration. Furthermore, the contribution of CH4 oxidation to heterotrophic respiration showed a distinct diurnal cycle being negligible during nighttime while contributing up to 35 +/- 3.0% during the daytime. Our results show that CH4 oxidation may represent an important component of the peatland ecosystem respiration and highlight the value of our method for measuring in-situ CH4 oxidation to better understand carbon dynamics in peatlands.

AB Peatlands are interesting as a carbon storage option, but are also natural emitters of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Phragmites peatlands are particularly interesting due to the global abundance of this wetland plant (Phragmites australis) and the highly efficient internal gas transport mechanism, which is called humidity-induced convection (HIC). The research aims were to (1) clarify how this plant-mediated gas transport influences the CH4 fluxes, (2) which other environmental variables influence the CO2 and CH4 fluxes, and (3) whether Phragmites peatlands are a net source or sink of greenhouse gases. CO2 and CH4 fluxes were measured with the eddy covariance technique within a Phragmites-dominated fen in southwest Germany. One year of flux data (March 2013-February 2014) shows very clear diurnal and seasonal patterns for both CO2 and CH4. The diurnal pattern of CH4 fluxes was only visible when living, green reed was present. In August the diurnal cycle of CH4 was the most distinct, with 11 times higher midday fluxes (15.7 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) than night fluxes (1.41 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). This diurnal cycle has the highest correlation with global radiation, which suggests a high influence of the plants on the CH4 flux. But if the cause were the HIC, it would be expected that relative humidity would correlate stronger with CH4 flux. Therefore, we conclude that in addition to HIC, at least one additional mechanism must be involved in the creation of the convective flow within the Phragmites plants. Overall, the fen was a sink for carbon and greenhouse gases in the measured year, with a total carbon uptake of 221 g Cm-2 yr(-1) (26% of the total assimilated carbon). The net uptake of greenhouse gases was 52 gCO(2) eq.m(-2) yr(-1), which is obtained from an uptake of CO2 of 894 gCO(2) eq.m(-2) yr(-1) and a release of CH4 of 842 gCO(2) eq.m(-2) yr(-1).

AB A lysimeter method was evaluated for its suitability in gas emission studies by studying the effect of temperature on CO2 emissions (dark respiration) from cultivated peat soils. The study was carried out with organic soils from two locations in Sweden, a typical cultivated fen peat with low pH and high organic matter content (Orke) and a more uncommon fen peat with high pH and low organic matter content (Majnegarden). A drilling method with minimal soil disturbance was used to collect 12 undisturbed soil lysimeters per site. CO2 emission was measured weekly from the vegetated lysimeters and the results were Compared with data from incubation experiments. The CO2 emissions measured in the lysimeter experiment were in the same range as those in other studies and showed a similar increase with temperature as in the incubation experiment. With climatic and drainage conditions being similar in the lysimeter experiment, differences in daytime CO2 emission rates between soils (483 mg +/- 6.9 CO2 m(-2) h(-1) from the Orke soil and 360 +/- 7.5 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) from the MainegArden soil) were presumably due to soil quality differences. Q(10) values of 2.1 and 3.0 were determined in the lysimeter experiment and of 1.9 to 4.5 in the incubation experiment for Orke and Majnegarden respectively. CO2 emission data fitted well to a semi-empirical equation relating CO2 emissions to air temperature. The lysimeter method proved to be well suited for CO2 emission studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Increases in solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B; 280-320 nm) reaching the earth have been estimated to continue until 2050s in the boreal and subarctic regions with an abundant peatland cover. Peatlands are significant sinks for carbon dioxide (CO2) and sources for methane (CH4). To assess whether the future increases in UV-B could affect the fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in peatlands via an impact on vegetation, we exposed peatland microcosms to modulated 30% supplementation of erythemally weighted UV-B at an outdoor facility for one growing season. The experimental design included appropriate controls for UV-A and ambient radiation. The UV-B caused a significant reduction in gross photosynthesis, net ecosystem CO2 exchange, and CH4 emission of the peatland microcosms. These changes in the carbon gas cycling can be partly explained by UV-B-induced morphological changes in Eriophorum vaginatum which acts as a conduit for CH4. Leaf cross section and the percentage of CH4-conducting aerenchymatous tissue in E. vaginatum were significantly reduced by UV-B. Methanol-extractable UV-B absorbing compounds decreased under both UV-B and UV-A in Sphagnum angustifolium, and tended to accumulate under UV-B in S. papillosum. Membrane permeability to magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) ions was higher in UV-B exposed S. angustifolium. Amount of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments was increased by UV-A in S. magellanicum. The observed changes in Sphagnum mosses did not coincide with those in carbon gas fluxes but occurred at the time of the highest UV intensity in the mid summer. Our findings indicate that increasing UV-B may have more substantial effects on gas exchange in peatlands than previously thought.

AB This study used mesocosms to examine the effects of alternate drying and rewetting on CO2 and CH4 emissions from high-altitude peatlands on the Tibetan Plateau. The drying and rewetting experiment conducted in this study included three phases: a 10-day predrying phase, a 32-day drying phase, and an 18-day rewetting phase. During the experiment, the water table varied between 0 and 50 cm with respect to the reference peat column where the water table stayed constant at 0 cm. The study found that drying and rewetting had no significant effect on CO2 emissions from the peatland, while CH4 emissions decreased. The cumulative CH4 emissions in the control group was 2.1 times higher than in the drying and rewetting treatment over the study period. Moreover, CO2 and CH4 emissions were positively correlated with soil temperature, and the drying process increased the goodness of fit of the regression models predicting the relationships between CO2 and CH4 emissions and temperature. These results indicate that small-scale water table variation has a limited effect on CO2 emissions, but might reduce CH4 emissions in high-altitude peatlands on the Tibetan Plateau.

AB Fens, which extend over vast areas in the Northern hemisphere, are sources of the greenhouse gas CH4. Climate change scenarios predict a lowering water table (WT) in mires. To study the effect of WT drawdown on CH4 dynamics in a fen ecosystem, we took advantage of a WT drawdown gradient near a ground water extraction plant. Methane fluxes and CH4 production and oxidation potentials were related to microbial communities responsible for the processes in four mire locations (wet, semiwet, semidry, and dry). Principal component analyses performed on the vegetation, pH, CH4, and WT results clearly separated the four sampling locations in the gradient. Long-term lowering of WT was associated with decreased coverage of Sphagnum and aerenchymatic plants, decreased CH4 field emissions and CH4 production potential. Based on mcrA terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism the methanogen community structure correlated best with the methane production and coverage of aerenchymatic plants along the gradient. Methanosarcinaceae and Methanocellales were found at the pristine wet end of the gradient, whereas the Fen cluster characterized the dry end. The methane-oxidizing bacterial community consisted exclusively of Methylocystis bacteria, but interestingly of five different alleles (T, S, R, M, and O) of the particulate methane monooxygenase marker gene pmoA. The M allele was dominant in the wet locations, and the occurrence of alleles O, S, and T increased with drainage. The occurrence of the R allele that characterized the upper peat layer correlated with CH4 oxidation potential. These results advance our understanding of mire dynamics after long-term WT drawdown and of the microbiological bases of methane emissions from mires.

TI Ecosystem-scale flux of CO2 from a restored vacuum harvested peatland
SO WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article

   restoration
AB At the ecosystem scale, the water and gas exchange processes are strongly coupled. Drainage and removal of a peatland's surface vegetation cover for peat harvesting alters its hydrology, and as a direct consequence the carbon budget. Previous studies have measured peatland-atmosphere carbon exchange using the chamber methodology. These studies have indicated that the spatial and temporal variability is large, suggesting the need for continuous ecosystem-scale measurements. This paper presents ecosystem scale measurements of the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon dioxide (CO2) from a restored vacuum-harvested peatland in eastern Quebec, Canada, using the eddy correlation measurement approach.
   Results indicate that the adopted restoration practices reduce the loss of water from the peat. Evapotranspiration from the restored site was 20 and 25% less than that from an adjacent abandoned comparison site in 2000 and 2001 respectively. However, CO2 emissions remain large during non-snow periods (478 and 468 g C m(-2) in 2000 and 2001, respectively). The blockage of drainage ditches and the existence of a mulch cover at the site keep the moisture and thermal conditions more or less constant. Consequently, the CO2 flux, which is predominantly soil respiration, is strongly controlled by peat temperature fluctuations.

AB Peatlands are globally significant sources of atmospheric methane (CH4). In the northern hemisphere, extensive geologic exploration activities have occurred to map petroleum deposits. In peatlands, these activities result in soil compaction and wetter conditions, changes that are likely to enhance CH4 emissions. To date, this effect has not been quantified. Here we map petroleum exploration disturbances on peatlands in Alberta, Canada, where peatlands and oil deposits are widespread. We then estimate induced CH4 emissions. By our calculations, at least 1900 km(2) of peatland have been affected, increasing CH4 emissions by 4.4-5.1 kt CH4 yr(-1) above undisturbed conditions. Not currently estimated in Canada's national reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, inclusion would increase current emissions from land use, land use change and forestry by 7-8%. However, uncertainty remains large. Research further investigating effects of petroleum exploration on peatland GHG fluxes will allow appropriate consideration of these emissions in future peatland management.

AB The largest terrestrial-to-atmosphere carbon flux is respired CO2. However, the partitioning of soil and plant sources, understanding of contributory mechanisms, and their response to climate change are uncertain. A plant removal experiment was established within a peatland located in the UK uplands to quantify respiration derived from recently-fixed plant carbon and that derived from decomposition of soil organic matter, using natural abundance C-13 and bomb-C-14 as tracers. Soil and plant respiration sources were found respectively to contribute similar to 36% and between 41 and 54% of the total ecosystem CO2 flux. Respired CO2 produced in the clipped ('soil') plots had a mean age of similar to 15 years since fixation from the atmosphere, whereas the C-14 content of ecosystem CO2 was statistically indistinguishable from the contemporary atmosphere. Results of carbon mass balance modelling showed that, in addition to respiration from bulk soil and plant respired CO2, a third, much older source of CO2 existed. This source, which we suggest is CO2 derived from the catotelm constituted between similar to 10 and 23% of total ecosystem respiration and had a mean radiocarbon age of between several hundred and similar to 2000 years before present (BP). These findings show that plant-mediated transport of CO2 produced in the catotelm may form a considerable component of peatland ecosystem respiration. The implication of this discovery is that current assumptions in terrestrial carbon models need to be re-evaluated to consider the climate sensitivity of this third source of peatland CO2.

AB Methane emission feedbacks in wetlands are predicted to influence global climate under climate change and other anthropogenic stressors. Herein, we review the taxonomy and physiological ecology of the microorganisms responsible for methane production in peatlands. Common in peat soils are five of the eight described orders of methanogens spanning three phyla (Euryarchaeota, Halobacterota and Thermoplasmatota). The phylogenetic affiliation of sequences found in peat suggest that members of the thus-far-uncultivated group Candidatus Bathyarchaeota (representing a fourth phylum) may be involved in methane cycling, either anaerobic oxidation of methane and/or methanogenesis, as at least a few organisms within this group contain the essential gene, mcrA, according to metagenomic data. Methanogens in peatlands are notoriously challenging to enrich and isolate; thus, much remains unknown about their physiology and how methanogen communities will respond to environmental changes. Consistent patterns of changes in methanogen communities have been reported across studies in permafrost peatland thaw where the resulting degraded feature is thermokarst. However much remains to be understood regarding methanogen community feedbacks to altered hydrology and warming in other contexts, enhanced atmospheric pollution (N, S and metals) loading and direct anthropogenic disturbances to peatlands like drainage, horticultural peat extraction, forestry and agriculture, as well as post-disturbance reclamation.

AB Rates and delta C-13 values of CH4 flux are reported from an upland blanket mire (Blaen Fign) situated in Wales UK. The delta C-13 values of CH4 flux were similar from Sphagnum and vascular flora dominated areas despite flux rates being an order of magnitude greater from the latter. Methane flux was C-13-depleted relative to belowground CH4, indicating that transport occurred predominately via passive diffusion through vascular flora and that pore water diffusion and ebullition contributed little to CH4 flux. The strong influence of vascular flora abundance on CH4 flux strength suggests that any factors altering vegetation assemblages in blanket mires will likely impact CH4 emission rates. Methane flux from Blaen Fign was highly C-13-depleted compared to emissions from minerotrophic wetlands, suggesting that delta C-13 values may be useful for tracing CH4 flux from blanket mires and other types of ombrogenous peatlands to the global CH4 budget.

AB The study aimed to understand the inter-annual variations of methane (CH4) emissions from an open fen on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) from 2005 to 2007. The weighted mean CH4 emission rate was 8.37 +/- 11.32 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) during the summers from 2005 to 2007, falling in the range of CH4 fluxes reported by other studies, with significant inter-annual and spatial variations. The CH4 emissions of the year of 2006 (2.11 +/- 3.48 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) were 82% lower than the mean value of the years 2005 and 2007 (13.91 +/- 17.80 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and 9.44 +/- 14.32 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), respectively), responding to the inter-annual changes of standing water depths during the growing season of the three years. Significant drawdown of standing water depth is believed to cause such significant reduction in CH4 emissions from wetlands in the year 2006, probably through changing the methanogen composition and decreasing its community size as well as activating methanotrophs to enhance CH4 oxidation. Our results are helpful to understand the inter-annual variations of CH4 emission and provide a more reasonable regional budget of CH4 emission from wetlands on the QTP and even for world-wide natural wetlands under climate change.

AB Carbon dioxide emissions and the mass loss of peat incubated in situ were measured in peat soils in the Australian Alps. The carbon chemistry of incubated peats was characterized using C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In situ decomposition decreased as a function of increasing alkyl carbon content of the initial organic matter, providing direct evidence of the oft-cited link between substrate quality and decomposition rates. More mass loss occurred in the bog peat samples than in the dried peat samples. However, at the peat surface, the amount of CO2 emitted was not significantly different between bog peat and dried peat. Carbon inputs, and therefore the sink or source status, of these peats are yet to be quantified.

AB Vegetation, temperature and hydrology are major factors controlling wetland methane (CH4) dynamics. In order to test their importance, we measured CH4 emissions and environmental characteristics over 2 years from five mires representing a successional sequence, ranging in age from 178 to 2,520 years. We hypothesized CH4 emissions to be higher from the sedge-dominated fens than from the older bog stage. The more constant hydrological conditions at later successional stages as a consequence of the thicker peat layer appeared to result in lower temporal variation in CH4 emissions. Accordingly, the other controls, temperature and vegetation, had an effect on CH4 emissions only when the water table was sufficiently high. The seasonal variation in CH4 emissions was controlled by temperature only at the oldest study site, which had the lowest variation in water table. Within-season variation in emissions related to plant phenology was highest at the fen stage, which was dominated by aerenchymatous plants with a strong seasonal pattern, namely sedges and forbs. In contrast to our hypothesis, CH4 emissions increased with mire age towards the bog stage. However, the trend did not emerge during a rainy growing season, due to a rise in CH4 emissions at the younger stages. The results may imply two different mechanisms during mire succession: while old mires are able to avoid the perturbation associated with variation in the water table and maintain their function as CH4 emitters, young mires are exposed to perturbation but are able to recover their function.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is approximately 265 times more potent than carbon dioxide (CO2) in atmospheric warming. Degraded peatlands are important sources of N2O. The more a peat soil is degraded, the higher the N2O-N emissions from peat. In this study, soil bulk density was used as a proxy for peat degradation to predict N2O-N emissions. Here we report that the annual N2O-N emissions from European managed peatlands (EU-28) sum up to approximately 145 Gg N year(-1). From the viewpoint of greenhouse gas emissions, highly degraded agriculturally used peatlands should be rewetted first to optimally reduce cumulative N2O-N emissions. Compared to a business-as-usual scenario (no peatland rewetting), rewetting of all drained European peatlands until 2050 using the suggested strategy reduces the cumulative N2O-N emissions by 70%. In conclusion, the status of peat degradation should be made a pivotal criterion in prioritising peatlands for restoration.
   Rewetting agricultural peatlands first is the best strategy for reducing cumulative nitrous oxide emissions from European peatlands, according to an analysis of soil bulk density as a proxy for peat degradation.

AB The conventional chamber technique was used to measure CH4 and CO2 emission to the atmosphere from snow-covered ombrotrophic bogs (57 degreesN, 82 degreesE, Plotnikovo, West Siberia). The average +/- standard deviation values for CH4 and CO2 fluxes in mid-February were found to be equal mg m(-2) d(-1) 5.0 +/- 3.7 and 69+/-52, respectively. The contribution of cold season to annual methane fluxes varied from 3.5 to 11% depending on the calculation method and was similar to that found in Alaska and northern Minnesota. The vertical profiles of gases in snow were linear implying the applicability of the simple diffusion equation under steady state conditions. The diffusion reduction factor due to porous resistance and tortuousity of snowpack was 0.18 and 0.29 for methane and carbon dioxide, respectively. Thus snow forms only a passive cap which controls the gas concentration at the snow-soil interface, while gas flux into the atmosphere is controlled by gas production in the soil: The fresh samples of frozen peat soil incubated under laboratory conditions at constant temperature -16 degreesC displayed very slow, but steady respiration varied from 0.05 to 0.2 mg CO2-C d(-1) dm(-3) depending on peat sampling depth. Although this activity was 200-300 times lower than soil respiration in summertime, it was enough to support the observed in situ winter CO2 emission. The thaw and subsequent peat incubation at 15 degreesC accelerated gas formation up to 2-5 mg CO2-C and 1.2 mg CH4-C h(-1) dm(-3) of peat after 3-4 days of incubation followed by a decline by I order of magnitude and approaching a new steady state level. Although the mechanism of freeze-thaw activation needs further clarification, it was nevertheless possible to simulate the observed activation dynamics by a mathematical model which accounts for the burst of microbial growth on nutrients released into soil from frost-damaged cells.

AB The structure and functional activity of microbial complexes of a forest oligo-mesotrophic subshrub-grass-moss bog (OMB, Central Evenkiya) and a subshrub-sedge bog in the polygonal tundra (PB, Lena River Delta Samoylovsky Island) was studied. Soil of the forest bog (OMB) differed from that of the polygonal tundra bog (PB) in higher productivity (C-org, N-total, P, and K reserves), higher biomass of aerobic chemoorganotrophs (2.0 to 2.6 times), and twice the level of available organic matter. The contribution of microorganisms to the carbon pool was different, with the share of C-mic in C-org 1.4 to 2.5 times higher in PB compared to OMB. Qualitative composition of the methane cycle microorganisms in PB and OMB soils differed significantly. Methanogenic archaea (Euryarchaeota) in the shrub-sedge PB of tundra were more numerous and diverse than in the oligo-mesotrophic bog (OMB) and belonged to six families (Methanomassiliicoccaceae, Methanoregulaceae, Methanobacteriaceae, Methanomicrobiaceaee, Methanosarcinaceae, and Methanotrichaceae), while members of only four families (Methanosarcinacea, Methanobacteriaceae, Methanotrichaceae, and Methanomassiliicoccaceae) were revealed in OMB. In both bogs, methane-oxidizing bacteria belonged to Alphaproteobacteria (II) and Gammaproteobacteria (I). Methanotroph diversity was higher in OMB than in PB. Microbial communities of PB soils had higher potential activity of methanogenesis and methanotrophy compared to those of OMB. Methanogenic and methanotrophic activities in PB were 20 and 2.3 times higher, respectively, than in OMB.

AB The sustainability argument that more peat grows in Finland than is used does not hold. On designated peatlands, growth is about 85 times slower than peat use; growth elsewhere in Finland does not add to available resources. Claiming undisturbed peatlands as carbon sinks for sustainable peat use is also misleading as anthropogenic carbon sources require additional sinks, not natural ones. Undisturbed peatlands usually emit significant quantities of methane. About 57 000 km(2) of forestry drained peatlands now have effectively stopped emitting methane, and temporarily accumulate more carbon annually than earlier. These greenhouse reducing aspects are only modestly compensated or 'used' by emissions from peat used for energy. However, as forests mature and the peat underneath continues to oxidise, the new carbon sink will eventually turn into a carbon source. Multiple claims of this very same anthropogenic carbon sink (perhaps by the peat, paper and timber industry), i.e. double counting, may be avoided by certifying these sinks. After peat harvesting (liberating in the order of 375 kg atmospheric carbon per m(2)), wood in a production/harvest cycle may be grown (at 0.1 kgC/m(2) per a) on the now available area, as a renewable energy source. These numbers indicate the slow rate at which these cycles, that are in principle carbon neutral in themselves, help compensate for the carbon emissions from the earlier use of peat by avoiding the emissions of fossil fuels otherwise used.

AB Northern peatlands are sinks for atmospheric carbon (C), but peat extraction converts these ecosystems to C sources. Due to a dry regional climate, undisturbed bog peatlands in western Canada often have a tree cover of Picea mariana (Mill.) B. S. P. Thus, a coniferous forest plantation may be an appropriate land use for cutover peatlands. This study determined the effect of a 7-year-old P. mariana plantation on C balance of a cutover peatland. We measured C stored in P. mariana biomass and carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes from bare peat at each of four fertilizer doses. Carbon stored in biomass of Betula papyrifera (Marsh.) that had spontaneously colonized the postfertilized site was also determined. Given that the water table remained very deep and that the sphagnum moss-ericaceous shrub peat-accumulating vegetation was not present, the site remained a source of C when only the planted P. mariana trees were considered, primarily in the form of CO2 emissions by soil respiration. However, C accumulation in trees, including B. papyrifera biomass, resulted in a net C sink in fertilized plots. Results from this study indicate that tree plantations on cutover peatland may be a suitable land-management strategy on sites difficult to effectively rewet.

AB The importance of vegetation in affecting CH4 emissions was investigated in a Carex-dominated fen located near Schefferville, Quebec, and in the Experimental Lakes Area, Ontario. Comparison of emission rates with and without the presence of aboveground vegetation indicated that over 90% of the emission was plant-associated transport. Further evidence of this association was found in a linear correlation of CH4 emission with aboveground plant biomass (R=0.93). To test the importance of aboveground plant photosynthetic production on methane production, aboveground vegetation was clipped from sites continually over the growing season. Both emissions and dissolved pore water CH4 were reduced relative to adjacent vegetated areas. A significant correlation (R=0.93) of CH4 emissions with net CO2 exchange in this fen gives evidence of the close association between new plant production and methanogenesis.

AB Measurement of the spatial variability of CH4 emissions and net CO2 ecosystem exchange were made in a boreal peatland in northern Sweden in the summers of 1992 and 1993. Variability was monitored at the microscale (hummocks and hollows), mesoscale (ridges, lawns and pools), and macroscale (landforms) to assess the role of peatland topography on the magnitude and variability of the fluxes. The general trend is for topographically lower areas, such as hollows, pools, or peatland margins, to have higher CH4 emissions and lower CO2 uptake than the adjacent topographically higher areas such as hummocks, ridges, and plateaus. However, the greatest difference occurs at the microtopographic scale because the maximum differences in water table position and temperature occur at the microscale. The CH4 nux at the margins of the peatland was three to four times greater than that observed at the central plateau sites. Net CO2 uptake was also greatest at the margin sites. A combined mesomacro topographic model (MMF) was used to estimate the total peatland CH4 and CO2 exchange. The model indicates that a failure to measure the exchange of carbon from peatland pools can result in a large overestimate of the total peatland NEE and therefore carbon accumulation rates.

AB Net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE) and its components, gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), were compared between a bog and an abandoned peatland pasture within the same peatland complex in western Newfoundland, Canada. Measurements based on the eddy covariance technique from April 2014 to April 2016 were used to examine the influence of agricultural management and abandonment on peatland carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange. NEE, GPP and ER at both sites showed pronounced seasonal variation, peaking near the middle growing season. The maximum net CO2 uptake rate of -28.61 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and emission rate of 14.39 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at the pasture were significantly higher than those at the bog (-9.67 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 5.50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively). Daytime average GPP was related to photosynthetic photon flux density and air temperature and the nighttime average ER decreased with soil water content, but increased with surface soil temperature for both sites. Annual NEE of the pasture (-128 +/- 60 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15 and -124 +/- 56 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015-16) was considerably larger than that of the bog (-46 +/- 36 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15). GPP of 1086 +/- 141 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15 and 982 +/- 123 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015-16 and ER of 957 129 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15 and 858 +/- 112 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015-16 at the pasture were approximately twice the magnitude of the corresponding fluxes at the bog. The difference in GPP between the bog and pasture was mainly related to their different aboveground biomass. Higher ER at the pasture was probably related to its lower water table depth, greater substrate availability and higher autotrophic respiration. Unlike previous findings that managed peat lands are large CO2 emitters, our results suggest that abandoned peatland pastures can function like natural grasslands and sequester considerable amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere.

AB The variability of methane flux with season, year, and habitat type was investigated in northern Minnesota peatlands from September 1988 through September 1990. Average daily fluxes calculated by integration of annual data for an open poor fen, an open bog, a forested bog hollow, a fen lagg in the forested bog and a forested bog hummock were 180, 118, 38, 35, and 10 mg CH4 m-2 d-1, respectively. Fluxes among the five ecosystems were significantly different from one another, although emission from all sites was highest in July and lowest in March. Winter fluxes occurred in all sites but the fen lagg. There was no difference in fluxes measured from the same sites in the spring of 1986, 1989, or 1990, but summer fluxes were significantly higher in the wetter year of 1989 than in 1990, and a summer pulse in methane emission occurred in 1989 that was not seen the next year. Concentrations of methane in pore water, reflecting the seasonal balance of production, oxidation, and release, declined during the month of peak flux, then increased to levels of about 500 muM in December. Consistent spatial and temporal differences in flux could be ascribed to differences in water table, temperature, and peat nutrient status. although additional variability remained. Integration gave an annual average flux of 20 g CH4 m-2 for the three bog ecosystems and 39 g CH4 m-2 for the two fen ecosystems. This gives an estimate of 1-2 Tg CH4 yr-1 from peatlands in the Great Lake states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan.

AB The method of component integration was tested in the course of studies in typical biogeocenoses of the north of Western Siberia. This method as applied for separate horizons made it possible not only to estimate the contribution of different sources to the total efflux of CO2 from soils but also to evaluate the participation of horizons in soil respiration. Root respiration contributed to about 14 +/- 3% of the CO2 efflux from the permafrost-affected peat soil (Hemic Cryic Histosol) and to about 29 +/- 6% of the CO2 efflux from the tonguing podzol (Glossic Albic Rustic Podzol (Arenic)). Histosol was characterized by a higher storage of total (organic and inorganic) carbon (26 kg C/m(2)), extractable carbon (C-extr) (32 g C/m(2)), and microbial carbon (C-mic) (43 g C/m(2)). Its upper horizon (TO) contained about 50% of the total soil storage of C-mic and 100% of the total storage of roots (up to 300 g/m(2)). It had the maximum activity of microbiota and contributed to more than 70% of the total efflux of CO2 from the active layer (on average, 35 cm in thickness) of Cryic Histosol. Podzol was characterized by the low storage of total carbon (6 kg C/m(2)), considerable storage of C-mic (38 g C/m(2)), and much higher microbial activity. This circumstance, together with a tenfold higher storage of the roots (up to 3000 g C/m(2)) and favorable temperature regime specified high values of the gross production of CO2 and its emission from the Podzol surface exceeding the corresponding values for the Cryic Histosol by three-five times. The mineral profile of Podzol contributed to about 20% of the total efflux of CO2 from this soil (on average, about 38 cm in thickness).

AB Eddy covariance (EC) technique is a widely used method to quantify the net exchange of CO2 between ecosystems and the atmosphere. The quality control and data analysis of calculated fluxes are essential to ensure accurate budget estimates. Ecosystem scale CO2 exchange between a typical permafrost peatland of the Great Hing'an Mountains and the atmosphere was measured during the growing season of 2014 and 2015 using the open-path eddy covariance technique. Footprint analysis and turbulence stationary test were applied to the calculated fluxes to improve the data accuracy. High quality data were then screened to study emission patterns. Combining widely used models with the observed data, an empirical model derived by photosynthetically active radiation was developed to fit daily photosynthesis reduction. Seasonal variation of apparent quantum yield (alpha, mol CO2 mol(-1) photon), maximum photosynthesis rate (P-max, mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) and temperature sensitivity for respiration (E-0, K) were found to follow a unimodal distribution and could be simulated by a Gaussian based equation. The use of EC data and the potential issues, especially the bias on respiration estimation, were discussed. Detailed utilization and analyses of the EC data are helpful in revealing the CO2 exchange patterns on different time scales, and also contribute to reducing the result differences between EC and other measurement techniques.

AB Peatlands are significant carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks and methane (CH4) sources. In this study, we investigated changes in CO2 and CH4 emissions from topsoil (0-20 cm) to subsoil (20-40 cm) in a permafrost peatland, and the related soil microbial abundance in response to increasing temperature and soil water content by using an incubation experiment. Our results indicated that CO2 and CH4 emissions from the permafrost peatland are highly sensitive to temperature and soil water content. CO2 emissions from topsoil and subsoil at 15 degrees C were 3.36 and 2.74 times larger, respectively, compared to those at 5 degrees C under the field moisture condition, and were 1.70 times larger under the waterlogged treatment in both topsoil and subsoil. CH4 emissions from 0-20 to 20-40 cm soils at 15 degrees C were 34 and 83 times larger, respectively, than those at 5 degrees C under the original state and 17 and 32 times larger under the waterlogged treatment. These results indicated that CH4 emissions are more sensitive than CO2 emissions, and waterlogged conditions could decrease temperature sensitivity of CO2 and CH4 emissions. Microbial analyses showed that the cumulative emissions amount of CO2 positively correlated with bacterial, fungal, and methanotroph abundances. Positive relationships were observed between CH4 emissions and abundances of bacteria, fungi, and archaea. These findings suggested that changes in temperature and water content alter CO2 and CH4 emissions from permafrost peatlands through controlling abundances of soil bacteria, fungi, archaea, and methanotrophs. These variables bear importance in accurately estimating C emissions from permafrost peatlands.

AB Methane emissions measured at three subactic fen sites by dynamic and static chambers were compared; in the dynamic chambers, the air was circulated at a wind speed of 1.9 m s-1.  Emissions ranged from 7 to 214 mg CH4 m-2 d-1 and measurements from the two types of chamber were strongly correlated (r2 = 0.72), with no overall difference between the means (paired t-test, p = 0.34) and with only 4 of the 14 comparisons showing statistically different means (t-test, p < 0.25).  The overall ratio of dynamic: static chamber fluxes was 1.24, but was highest (1.68) at the wettest, central site and lowest (0.74) at the driest, edge site.  The coefficients of variation of chamber flux measurements at each site ranged from 0.13 to 1.77, with an overall average of 0.53; sampling with over 30 static chambers revealed approximately normal distributions at the edge and middle sites and a positively skewed distribution at the central site.  Within both static and dynamic chambers, methane concentrations increased linearly through 24 h.  These inexpensive, protable static chambers can be used to replicate methane emission measurements within a wide range of wetland sites.

AB Elevated atmospheric CO2 may create greater methane (CH4) emissions from subarctic wetlands. To date such ecosystem feedbacks remain poorly understood, particularly in relation to how different wetland plant species will control such feedbacks. In this study we exposed plant-peat mesocosms planted with four Cyperaceae species to 400 and 800 ppm atmospheric CO2 concentrations and measured plant and peat properties as well as CH4 fluxes. Above ground biomass for plants grown at 800 ppm CO2 increased for E. angustifolium, Eriophorum vaginatum and Carex brunnescens, but the total biomass of C. acuta decreased relative to the ambient CO2 treatment. The plant species and elevated CO2 treatment affected both peat redox potential and pore water chemistry. There was no overall effect of the elevated CO2 on CH4 emissions, however, CH4 emissions were related to above ground biomass and redox potential, both of which were significantly altered by elevated CO2. Our study shows that species composition poses an important control on how wetland communities will respond to elevated CO2 and that plant mediated changes of peat biogeochemical processes, in response to elevated CO2 levels, may affect CH4 emissions from sub-arctic wetlands, but any such responses will differ among species.

AB Drainage of waterlogged sites has been part of the normal forestry practice in Fennoscandia, the Baltic countries, the British Isles and in some parts of Russia since the early 20(th) century, and currently, about 15 million hectares of peatlands and other wetlands have been drained for forestry purposes. The rate of forest clear-felling on drained peatlands will undergo a rapid increase in the near future, when a large number of these forests approach their regeneration age. A small-scale pilot survey was performed at two nutrient-rich and old peatland drainage areas in southern Finland to study if forest clear-felling has significant impacts on the exchange of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) between soil and atmosphere. The average N2O emissions from the two drainage areas during three growing seasons following clear-felling were 945 and 246 mug m(-2) d(-1). The corresponding CH4 fluxes were -0.07 and -0.52 mg m(-2) d(-1). Clear-felling had impacts on the environmental factors known to affect the N2O and CH4 fluxes of peatlands, i.e. clear-felling raised the water table level and increased the peat temperature. However, no substantial changes in the fluxes of CH4 following clear-felling were observed. The results concerning N2O indicated a potential for increased emissions following clear-felling of drained peatland forests, but further studies are needed for a critical evaluation of the impacts of clear-felling on the fluxes of CH4 and N2O.

AB Boreal peatlands are significant natural sources of methane and especially vulnerable to abrupt climate change. However, the controlling factors of CH4 emission in boreal peatlands are still unclear. In this study, we investigated CH4 fluxes and abiotic factors (temperature, water table depth, active layer depth, and dissolved CH4 concentrations in pore water) during the growing seasons in 2010 and 2011 in both shrub-sphagnum-and sedge-dominated plant communities in the continuous permafrost zone of Northeast China. The objective of our study was to examine the effects of vegetation types and abiotic factors on CH4 fluxes from a boreal peatland. In an Eriophorum-dominated community, mean CH4 emissions were 1.02 and 0.80 mg m(-2) h(-1) in 2010 and 2011, respectively. CH4 fluxes (0.38 mg m(-2) h(-1)) released from the shrub-mosses-dominated community were lower than that from Eriophorum-dominated community. Moreover, in the Eriophorum-dominated community, CH4 fluxes showed a significant temporal pattern with a peak value in late August in both 2010 and 2011. However, no distinct seasonal variation was observed in the CH4 flux in the shrub-mosses-dominated community. Interestingly, in both Eriophorum- and shrub-sphagnum-dominated communities, CH4 fluxes did not show close correlation with air or soil temperature and water table depth, whereas CH4 emissions correlated well to active layer depth and CH4 concentration in soil pore water, especially in the Eriophorum-dominated community. Our results suggest that CH4 released from the thawed CH4-rich permafrost layer may be a key factor controlling CH4 emissions in boreal peatlands, and highlight that CH4 fluxes vary with vegetation type in boreal peatlands. With increasing temperature in future climate patterns, increasing active layer depth and shifting plant functional groups in this region may have a significant effect on CH4 emission.

AB The effects of increased tropospheric ozone (O-3) pollution levels on methane (CH4) emissions from peatlands, and their underlying mechanisms, remain unclear. In this study, We exposed peatland mesocosms from a temperate wet heath dominated by the sedge Schoenus nigricans and Sphagnum papillosum to four O-3 treatments in open-top chambers for 2.5 years, to investigate the O-3 impacts on CH4 emissions and the processes that underpin these responses. Summer CH4 emissions, were significantly reduced, by 27% over the experiment, due to summer daytime (8 h day(-1)) O-3 exposure to non-filtered air (NFA) plus 35 ppb O-3, but were not significantly affected by year-round, 24h day(-1), exposure to NFA plus 10 ppb or NFA plus 25 ppb O-3. There was no evidence that the reduced CH4 emissions in response to elevated summer O-3 exposure were caused by reduced plant-derived carbon availability below-ground, because we found no significant effect of high summer O-3 exposure on root biomass, pore water dissolved organic carbon concentrations or the contribution of recent photosynthate to CH4 emissions. Our CH4 production potential and CH4 oxidation potential measurements in the different O-3 treatments could also not explain the observed CH4 emission responses to O-3. However, pore water ammonium concentrations at 20 cm depth were consistently reduced during the experiment by elevated summer O-3 exposure, and strong positive correlations were observed between CH4 emission and pore water ammonium concentration at three peat depths over the 2.5-year study. Our results therefore imply that elevated regional O-3 exposures in summer, but not the small increases in northern hemisphere annual mean background O-3 concentrations predicted over this century, may lead to reduced CH4 emissions from temperate peatlands as a consequence of reductions in soil inorganic nitrogen affecting methanogenic and/or methanotrophic activity.

AB Wilson, K. S. and Humphreys, E. R. 2010. Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes from Arctic mudboils. Can. J. Soil Sci. 90: 441-449. Climate change is expected to alter the Arctic's carbon (C) balance and changes in these C-rich ecosystems may contribute to a positive feedback on global climate change. Low-center mudboils, a form of patterned ground in the Arctic, are distinct landforms in which the exchange of greenhouse gases between the atmosphere and soil has not been fully characterized, but which may have an important influence on the overall C balance of tundra ecosystems. Chamber systems were used to sample net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and CO2 and CH4 effluxes along a 35-m transect intersecting two mudboils in a wet sedge fen in Canada's Southern Arctic (lat. 64 degrees 52'N, long. 111 degrees 34'W) during the summer months in 2008. Mudboil features gave rise to dramatic variations in vegetation, soil temperature and thaw depth, and soil organic matter content along this transect. Variations in NEE were driven by variations in the amount of vascular vegetation, while CO2 and CH4 effluxes were remarkably similar among the two mudboil (CO2 effluxes: 1.1 +/- 0.9 and 1.4 +/- 0.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); CH4 effluxes: 83.1 +/- 189.4 and 23.1 +/- 9.4 nmol m(-2) s(-1), +/-1 standard deviation) and the sedge fen (CO2 effluxes: 1.6 +/- 0.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); CH4 effluxes: 28.0 +/- 62.0 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) sampling areas. Vegetation appeared to play an important role in limiting temporal variations in CH4 effluxes through plant mediated transport in both mudboil and sedge fen sampling areas. One of the mudboils had negligible vascular plant colonization presumably due to more active frost heave processes. The relatively high CO2 and CH4 efflux in this mudboil area was speculated to be a result of growth and decomposition of cryptogamic organisms, inflow of dissolved organic C, and warmer soil temperatures.

AB Greenhouse gas fluxes (CH4, N2O and CO2) at a managed Finnish peat soil site were compared with those in a virgin fen in 1991 and 1992. The field site was drained about 60 years ago, and as it was used for pasturing and fodder production, the CH4 released by the cattle was estimated on the basis of data in the literature. The annual budgets of the gases were estimated and their GWP values calculated to assess the climatic impact of the current agricultural activity. Methane emission from the field site, 1 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1) was low, compared with that from the natural fen site, 260 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1). Annual N2O emission at the field site was 8 and 9 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Summer N2O emission in 1992 from vegetationless soil was five times higher than that from actual grassland. The N2O emissions from the natural fen site were low, close to the detection limit. The GWP for the field CH4 release (including cattle) corresponded to 0.3 X 10(4) kg CO2 ha(-1). The GWP for the annual N2O production was 0.2-0.4 x 10(4) kg CO2 ha(-1), while the grassland soil released 2.2 x 10(4) kg CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1). In its virgin state the field site may have accumulated 600 kg CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1). Although there must be a compensating carbon input into the soil in the form of root litter and exudates, a considerable carbon loss occurred (1.5 x 10(4) kg ha(-1) yr(-1)). The total GWP associated with cultivation was estimated to be 2.6 x 10(4) kg CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1).

AB Northern peatlands contain substantial reservoirs of carbon (C). Forestry activities endanger the C storages in some of these areas. While the initial impacts of forestry drainage on peatland greenhouse gas (GHG) balance have been studied, the impacts of other silvicultural practices, e.g. logging residue (LR) retention or removal, are not known. We measured the CH4, N2O and CO2 fluxes between peat soil and atmosphere with and without decomposing LR over three (2002-2004) seasons (May-Oct) following clearfelling in a drained peatland forest, along with the mass loss of LR. Seasonal average CO2 efflux from plots with LR (3070 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)) was twice as high as that from plots without LR (1447 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)). Less than 40% of this difference was accounted for by the decay of logging residues (530 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)), so the majority of the increased CO2 efflux was caused by increased soil organic matter decomposition under the LR. Furthermore LR increased soil N2O fluxes over 3-fold (0.70 g N2O m(-2) season(-1)), compared to plots without LR (019 g N2O m(-2) season(-1)), while no change in CH4 emissions was observed. Our results indicate that LR retention in clearfelled peatland sites may significantly increase GHG emissions and C release from the soil organic matter C storage. This would make the harvesting of LR for biofuel more beneficial, in the form of avoided emissions. Further investigations of the sources of CO2 under logging residues are, however, needed to confirm this finding. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Northern peatland methane (CH4) budgets are important for global CH4 emissions. This study aims to determine the ecosystem CH4 budget and specifically to quantify the importance of Phalaris arundinacea by using different chamber techniques in a temperate wetland. Annually, roughly 70 +/- 35% of ecosystem CH4 emissions were plant-mediated, but data show no evidence of significant diurnal variations related to convective gas flow regardless of season or plant growth stages. Therefore, despite a high percentage of arenchyma, P. arundinacea-mediated CH4 transport is interpreted to be predominantly passive. Thus, diurnal variations are less important in contrast to wetland vascular plants facilitating convective gas flow. Despite of plant-dominant CH4 transport, net CH4 fluxes were low (-aEuro parts per thousand 0.005-0.016 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and annually less than 1% of the annual C-CO2 assimilation. This is considered a result of an effective root zone oxygenation resulting in increased CH4 oxidation in the rhizosphere at high water levels. This study shows that although CH4, having a global warming potential 25 times greater than CO2, is emitted from this P. arundinacea wetland, less than 9% of the C sequestered counterbalances the CH4 emissions to the atmosphere. It is concluded that P. arundinacea-dominant wetlands are an attractive C-sequestration ecosystem.

AB Methane emission from the grass-moss fens of the Western Siberia subtaiga was studied using a static chamber method. It was established that CH4 flux median +/- half of the interquartile range in the studied wetland ecosystems constituted 4.9 +/- 2.9 mg of CH4/(m(2) h). It was shown that such a high spatial variability of emission is caused mainly by the difference in the water table level. It was found that, in these observations, a higher water table level correlates with lower emission values. The causes of this phenomenon are discussed, and recommendations for conducting field studies for estimating the regional flux are given.

AB Three scales of temporal variability were present in methane (CH4) flux data collected during a 2.5 year (mid-1990-1992) study at a small, poor fen in southeastern New Hampshire. (1) There was a strong seasonality to the fluxes (high in summer); monthly average fluxes range from 21.4 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) (February 1992) to 639.0 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) (July 1991). Annual fluxes were 68.8 g CH4 m(-2) (1991) and 69.8 g CH4 m(-2) (1992). (2) There was interannual variability; distribution of flux intensity was very different from 1991 to 1992, particularly the timing and rapidity of the onset of higher fluxes in the spring. (3) There was a high degree of variability in CH4 flux during the warm season; four successive weekly flux rates in July 1991 were 957, 1044, 170, and 491 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). Fluxes were correlated with peat temperature (r(2)=0.44) but only weakly with depth to water table (r(2)=0.14 for warm season data). Warm season fluxes appeared to be suppressed by rainstorms. Along with methane flux data we present an analysis of this temporal variability in flux, using a peatland soil climate model developed for this site. The model was driven by daily air temperature, precipitation, and net radiation; it calculated daily soil temperature and moisture profiles, water table location, and ice layer thickness. Temperature profiles were generally in good agreement with field data. Depth to water table simulations were good in 1992, fair in 1990, and poor in the summer of 1991. Using model-simulated peat climate and correlations to methane flux developed from the field data, simulated methane fluxes exhibited the same three modes of temporal variability that were present in the field flux data, though the model underestimated peak fluxes in 1990 and 1991. We conclude that temporal variability in flux is significantly influenced by climate/weather variability at all three scales and that rainfall appears to suppress methane flux for at least several days at this site.

AB About a quarter of the global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to agriculture, forestry and other land use. Few studies of afforested drained peatlands have measured exchanges of all three major greenhouse gases (GHG) at a given site, leading to uncertainty in estimated GHG budgets. Thus, we measured forest floor exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) at a well-drained afforested peatland in southern Sweden. The CO2 emissions (76000 kg ha(-1) a(-1); SE 6000) were large compared with previous measurements at similar sites, which may have been partly due to a measurement technique that did not underestimate the flux. A net CH4 uptake of 4.4 kg ha(-1) a(-1) (SE 0.41) and a net N2O emission of 2.7 kg ha(-1) a(-1) (SE 0.23) were found, which agreed well with published models relating fluxes to stand biomass (CH4 models) or soil C:N ratio (N2O models).

AB Peatlands in discontinuous permafrost regions occur as a mosaic of wetland types, each with variable sensitivity to climate change. Permafrost thaw further increases the spatial heterogeneity in ecosystem structure and function in peatlands. Carbon (C) fluxes are well characterized in end-member thaw stages such as fully intact or fully thawed permafrost but remain unconstrained for transitional stages that cover a significant area of thawing peatlands. Furthermore, changes in the environmental correlates of C fluxes, due to thaw, are not well described - a requirement for modeling future changes to C storage of permafrost peatlands. We investigated C fluxes and their correlates in end-member and a number of transitional thaw stages in a sub-arctic peatland. Across peatland-lumped CH4 and CO2 flux data had significant correlations with expected correlates such as water table depth, thaw depth, temperature, photosynthetically active radiation and vascular green area. Within individual thaw states, bivariate correlations as well as multiple regressions between C flux and environmental factors changed variably with increasing thaw. The variability in directions and magnitudes of correlates reflects the range of structural conditions that could be present along a thaw gradient. These structural changes correspond to changes in C flux controls, such as temperature and moisture, and their interactions. Temperature sensitivity of CH4 increased with increasing thaw in bivariate analyses, but lack of this trend in multiple regression analyses suggested cofounding effects of substrate or water limitation on the apparent temperature sensitivity. Our results emphasize the importance of incorporating transitional stages of thaw in landscape level C budgets and highlight that end-member or adjacent thaw stages do not adequately describe the variability in structure-function relationships present along a thaw gradient.

AB The results of research of diurnal and seasonal dynamics of CO2 emission from the oligotrophic swamp surface in the southern taiga subzone of Western Siberia in 2005-2007 are under consideration. During the summertime, the intensity of CO2 emission increases from spring to the midsummer and then decreases by the fall. A mean CO2 emission value was 118 mg CO2/(m(2) hour). The analysis of diurnal dynamics of CO2 emission showed that the maximum CO2 flux is observed at 16:00, while the minimum, at 07:00. Mean amplitude of diurnal variations of the CO2 emission is 74 mg CO2/(m(2) hour). The relations established between air temperature and CO2 flux allowed calculating carbon dioxide emission for the periods between measurements. It was found that in the summertime, the period between 10:00 and 13:00 was optimal for measuring CO2 emission with a chamber method.

AB The amount of wood ash produced in power plants is increasing with increasing use of forest biomass in energy production. Wood ash can be recycled as fertilizer especially in boreal peatland forests naturally rich in nitrogen. Improved nutrient availability and increases in soil pH can enhance microbial activities, decomposition of organic matter and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We studied the effects of granulated wood-ash on soil chemical properties, vegetation characteristics, decomposition rate and fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) in boreal peatland forests. In addition to the field measurements, we conducted laboratory experiments. Wood-ash fertilization changed soil chemical properties, altered understory vegetation, increased tree growth and decomposition rate but there were no significant changes in the N2O and CH4 fluxes in situ, whereas in laboratory incubations ash decreased the N2O production rate. The results show that there is no major risk of increasing GHG emissions after granulated wood-ash fertilization in boreal peatland forests.

AB Rich fens (minerotrophic peatlands with surface water pH > 5-5) have greater alkalinity and species richness than other boreal peatlands. We used short-term laboratory incubations to quantify CO2 and CH4 production in peat from five extreme-rich fens in Alberta. Carbon dioxide production rates averaged 48.29 +/- 1.36 mu mol CO2 g organic matter(-1) d(-1) across sites and sampling events. Peat from all sites produced CH4 during anaerobic incubations, leading to average anaerobic CH4 production rates of 359.53 +/- 138.7 nmol CH4 g organic matter(-1) d(-1). However, methane frequently was consumed (oxidized) during aerobic incubations, leading to aerobic CH4 consumption rates averaging 75.2 +/- 63.7 nmol CH4 g organic matter(-1) d(-1) across sites. Calculated rates of dissolved H2CO3 + HCO3- production averaged 59.7 +/- 13.4 mu mol g organic matter(-1) d(-1), suggesting that dissolved inorganic C is important to the overall C fluxes in these rich fens. Our results suggest that changing hydrologic conditions will influence the balance between methanogenesis and methanotrophy in rich fens, but that surface water chemistry, likely influenced by marl precipitation, also is important to decomposition. Rich fens are estimated to represent the most common wetland type in Alberta, and these peatland ecosystems could play an important role in trace gas emissions across boreal regions.

AB Boreal peatlands represent globally important long term sinks of carbon; however, horticultural peat extraction disrupts this carbon sink function, converting these ecosystems to large sources of greenhouse gases. Peatland restoration mitigates these emissions but to date no measurement of greenhouse gas exchange has been conducted on restored peatlands in western Canada, a region where continental climate could impact restoration success. We measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes during the growing season in a restored, cutover peatland in northern Alberta (Boreal Plain Ecozone) and compared these to fluxes measured on a neighboring unrestored area. Restoration resulted in a shift in mean growing season fluxes from 378g CO2C and 0.2g CH4-C at the unrestored site to 30g CO2-C and 3.7g CH4-C at the restored site, where positive values indicate flux of carbon from the peatland to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide exchange was correlated to vascular vegetation cover that varied depending on local water table position. Water table was also related to CH4 flux, with higher emissions from wet sites. Restoration activities should avoid creating very dry microsites where greenhouse gas emissions will remain high, while very wet sites may accumulate carbon as CO2 but will likely create areas of high CH4 flux.

AB The effects of temperature, water table, and precipitation on the methane fluxes from a boreal low-sedge Sphagnum papillosum pine fen were analyzed with statistical cross correlations of daily data. The six measurement sites represented different vegetation surfaces of the mire (hummocks, lawns, and flarks) with increasing moisture. The dynamics were analyzed separately for the early summer (May-July) and the late summer (August-October) periods in addition to the whole summer (May-October) period. Methane emissions increased with increasing peat temperature. During the late summer period, changes in peat temperatures at depths of 20 and 50 cm were reflected in methane emissions within 2 days. The persistently high water tables during the measurement period probably did not reveal the dynamics between water table fluctuations and methane emissions very clearly. Methane emission levels correlated negatively with depths of the water tables, that is, high methane emissions were associated with low water tables and vice versa. The suppression of methane emissions by filling the unsaturated gas space during precipitation and the increased release rate caused by a declining water table could explain the result. Methane emissions correlated positively with changes in water tables, that is, a rise in water table increased methane emissions during the early and whole summer periods. Precipitation increased emissions with a lag from zero to several days throughout the summer. Generally, the estimated responses of methane fluxes to precipitation and changes in water table indicated similar time lags. Methane flux from the flark surfaces seemed to respond rapidly to rainfall and changes in water table with a lag of zero or 1 day. In the lawn-low hummock, the lawn and one hummock site, methane flux showed a slow response with several days lag. This study strongly indicates that temperature, water table, and precipitation affect methane emissions with complex interactions.

AB We report the results of an investigation on the processes controlling heat transport in peat under a large bog in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands. For 2 years, starting in July 1998, we recorded temperature at 12 depth intervals from 0 to 400 cm within a vertical peat profile at the crest of the bog at sub-daily intervals. We also recorded air temperature I m above the peat surface. We calculate a peat thermal conductivity of 0.5 W m(-1)degrees C(-1) and model vertical heat transport through the peat using the SUTRA model. The model was calibrated to the first year of data, and then evaluated against the second year of collected heat data. The model results suggest that advective pore-water flow is not necessary to transport heat within the peat profile and most of the heat is transferred by thermal conduction alone in these waterlogged soils. In the spring season, a zero-curtain effect controls the transport of heat through shallow depths of the peat. Changes in local climate and the resulting changes in thermal transport still may cause non-linear feedbacks in methane emissions related to the generation of methane deeper within the peat profile as regional temperatures increase.

AB Soil freezing-thawing cycle (FTC) is an important factor controlling C dynamics in mid-high latitude regions, especially in the permafrost regions impacted by global warming. Nonetheless, the response of C cycling in the deeper active layers of permafrost regions to FTC remains far from certain. We aimed to characterize the emission of CO2 from soils of multiple depths as impacted by FTC and its relationship with active organic C (OC) and enzyme activities. We collected soil samples from three soil layers (0-15, 15-30, and 30-45 cm) of an undisturbed peatland in the Da Xing'anling Mountains, NE China, and then subjected them to various freezing (10 to -10 degrees C) and thawing (-10 to 10 degrees C) cycles. Soil CO2 emissions, two active OC fractions, and activities of three enzymes were monitored during incubation periods. At the thawing stage of the first FTC, CO2 emission rates in the three soil layers presented transient peaks being approximate to 1.6-1.7 times higher than those of the unfrozen control sample. Although FTC did not change the overall patterns of decreasing CO2 emission along the soil profile, FTC significantly reduced the amount of CO2 emission when compared with the unfrozen control sample, possibly because the small CO2 emission at the freezing stage neutralized the peak of CO2 emission at the thawing stage. This study suggests that in the active layer of permafrost peatlands, CO2 emission during FTCs may be lower than the emission under higher temperatures, but experiment with more temperature gradients should be encouraged to verify this conclusion in the future. Meanwhile, FTC significantly increased water extracted OC release from the three soil layers, approximate to 1.2-1.6 times higher compared to the unfrozen control sample, indicating that soil carbon loss in the form of leachate may increase during freezing-thawing periods. Additionally, the CO2 emissions impacted by FTCs were significantly correlated with active OC fractions and enzyme activities, which indicated that active OC and enzymes were sensitive to FTCs, and surviving microbes and enzymes might use the increased liable substrates and induce the CO2 emission during freezing-thawing periods.

AB Processes affecting CO2 and CH4 emissions and their budgets have been relatively well studied in northern temperate peatlands, whereas similar studies are almost absent in southern Patagonia and the high-altitude Andean peatlands, both of which are currently under heavy anthropogenic pressure. Theobjectives of this study were to compare greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in natural and managed peatlands to examine the effect of management on GHG emissions and identify the environmental parameters affecting them. We analysed CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions related to the physical and chemical conditions of the peat: in a natural and managed transitional bog in Quebec, Canada, a natural paramo andgrazed peatland in the Colombian Andes, and a bog and a fen in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. GHG fluxeswere measured using the dark static chamber method. Groundwater table, temperature, O-2 content, pH and redox potential were measured from observation wells, soil temperature was measured at four depths, peat samples were analysed for pH, soil organic matter and dry matter content, P, K, Ca, Mg, NH4-N, NO3-N, total N and C. In all regions, human- impacted peatlands showed significantly higher CO2-C, N2O-N and CH4-C emissions than their natural counterparts. The Canadian managed transitionalbog showed the highest average CO2-C (575 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) and N2O-N (0.08 mg N m(-2) h(-1)) emissions, whereas the Colombian pasture was the largest emitter of CH4-C (2.35 mg C m(-2) h(-1)). CO2-C emissionswere controlled by soil temperature and C content, whereas CH4-C flux was negatively correlated to dissolved oxygen content in peat water, and positively to water table level and soil log (C/NO3-N) ratio. Total Inorganic Nitrogen (TIN), C/N ratio, and soil temperature were the main factors controlling N2O emissions. Intensive peatland management alters the soil C/N balance, and increases and leads to higher variability of GHG emissions. Agricultural activities, especially crop production in peatlands, as well asintensive grazing in mountain peatland pastures, are the main factors increasing GHG emissions in the peatlands studied. Mitigation is possible via regulation of grazing intensity and replacing arable fields with grasslands. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands are widespread throughout the tropical Andean paramo. Despite the large carbon stocks in these ecosystems, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) flux data are lacking. In addition, cattle grazing is widespread in the paramo and could alter gas fluxes. Therefore, our objectives were to measure CO2 and CH4 fluxes with the static chamber technique in an undisturbed and in an intensively cattle grazed peatland in the mountains of Ecuador. We found that hummocks in the undisturbed site had higher net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and CH4 fluxes, compared to lawns. In contrast, microtopography at the grazed site did not predict CO2 fluxes, whereas vegetation cover was correlated for all three metrics (NEE, ER, and GPP). At low vegetation cover, NEE was positive (losing carbon). CH4 emissions in the undisturbed site were low (8.1 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). In contrast, CH4 emissions at the grazed site were much greater (132.3 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). This is probably attributable to trampling and nutrient inputs from cattle. In summary, the two peatlands differed greatly in CO2 and CH4 exchange rates, which could be due to the variation in climate and hydrology, or alternatively to intensive grazing by cattle.

AB The function of peatlands as a large carbon (C) reservoir results from the net C uptake under cold, wet, and acid environments. However, in the context of global warming, the balance between C input and release is expected to change, which may further alter the C sink of peatlands. To examine the response to climate warming of a temperate Sphagnum peatland which has been invaded by vascular plants, a mesocosm experiment was conducted with open top chambers (OTCs) to simulate a moderate temperature increase. Gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and methane (CH4) emissions were monitored for 2 years. The CO2 and CH4 fluxes were modeled by relating to abiotic and biotic factors, including temperature, water table depth (WTD), and vegetation, in order to calculate the annual C budget. Results showed that the annual cumulated GPP was significantly enhanced by the simulated warming (-602 compared to -501 gC m(-2) yr(-1) in OTC and control plots, respectively), mainly due to the increase of graminoid biomass by warming, while experimental warming had no significant effect on the annual ER and CH4 emissions (an output of 615 and 500 gC m(-2) yr(-1) for ER; 21 and 16 gC m(-2) yr(-1) for CH4 emissions in OTC and control plots, respectively). The annual NEE and C budget were not affected by the short-term experimental warming. The mesocosms under both treatments acted as a gaseous C source with 34 and 14 gC m(-2) yr(-1) output under OTC and control treatment, respectively. This C source was driven by the strong net carbon dioxide (CO2) release during a low WTD period in summer, as CH4 emissions only accounted for 0.9-2.2% of the total C fluxes. Our study identified the effect of moderate warming on the C fluxes, even on a short-term basis. Also, our findings highlighted that the response of C fluxes to warming largely depends on the WTD and vegetation composition. Thus, long-term monitoring of hydrology and vegetation change under climate warming is essential to examine their interactions in determining the C fluxes in peatlands.

AB We measured methane ebullition from a patterned boreal bog situated in the Siikaneva wetland complex in southern Finland. Measurements were conducted on water (W) and bare peat surfaces (BP) in three growing seasons (2014-2016) using floating gas traps. The volume of the trapped gas was measured weekly, and methane and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations of bubbles were analysed from fresh bubble samples that were collected separately. We applied a mixed-effect model to quantify the effect of the environmental controlling factors on the ebullition.
   Ebullition was higher from W than from BP, and more bubbles were released from open water (OW) than from the water's edge (EW). On average, ebullition rate was the highest in the wettest year ( 2016) and ranged between 0 and 253 mg m(-2) d(-1) with a median of 2 mg m(-2) d(-1), 0 and 147 mg m(-2) d(-1) with a median of 3 mg m(-2) d(-1), and 0 and 186 mg m(-2) d(-1) with a median of 28 mg m(-2) d(-1) in 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. Ebullition increased together with increasing peat temperature, weekly air temperature sum and atmospheric pressure, and decreasing water table (WT). Methane concentration in the bubbles released from W was 15-20 times higher than the CO2 concentration, and from BP it was 10 times higher. The proportion of ebullition fluxes upscaled to ecosystem level for the peak season was 2 %-8 % and 2 %- 5 % of the total flux measured with eddy covariance technique and with chambers and gas traps, respectively. Thus, the contribution of methane ebullition from wet non-vegetated surfaces of the bog to the total ecosystem-scale methane emission appeared to be small.

AB Throughout the Holocene, northern peatlands have both accumulated carbon and emitted methane. Their impact on climate radiative forcing has been the net of cooling (persistent CO(2) uptake) and warming (persistent CH(4) emission). We evaluated this by developing very simple Holocene peatland carbon flux trajectories, and using these as inputs to a simple atmospheric perturbation model. Flux trajectories are based on estimates of contemporary CH(4) flux (15-50 Tg CH(4) yr(-1)), total accumulated peat C (250-450 Pg C), and peatland initiation dates. The contemporary perturbations to the atmosphere due to northern peatlands are an increase of similar to 100 ppbv CH(4) and a decrease of similar to 35 ppmv CO(2). The net radiative forcing impact northern peatlands is currently about -0.2 to -0.5 W m(-2) (a cooling). It is likely that peatlands initially caused a net warming of up to +0.1 W m(-2), but have been causing an increasing net cooling for the past 8000-11 000 years. A series of sensitivity simulations indicate that the current radiative forcing impact is determined primarily by the magnitude of the contemporary methane flux and the magnitude of the total C accumulated as peat, and that radiative forcing dynamics during the Holocene depended on flux trajectory, but the overall pattern was similar in all cases.

AB Drained peatlands are known to be important sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). While CO2 emissions occur mainly during the growing season, large N2O emissions may occur during the non-growing season as well. Peatland re-wetting may be an effective measure to prevent those emissions. However, recent research shows that re-wetted peatlands may release large amounts of methane (CH4) during the years immediately after re-wetting whereas abandonment of intensive grassland on drained peat soils possibly leads to low nutrient supply and thus to small greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here we examine the role of extensification practices (such as abandonment of mineral fertilisation, reduced cutting frequency and a cattle-free winter period) on GHG emissions from a temperate peatland during winter. From November 2009 to March 2010 GHG measurements were made on a minerotrophic fen five years after intensive grassland use was abandoned. During the measurement period CO2 and N2O emissions amounted to 4.4 t ha(-1) and 2.6 t ha(-1) CO2-equivalent, whilst CH4 emissions were negligible. Altogether the site emitted 7 t ha(-1) CO2-equivalent, of which 37 % was N2O, even though the winter 2009/2010 was extraordinarily cold. Thus, extensification of grassland use alone may not be sufficient to reduce GHG emissions from temperate peatlands.

AB C-13 natural abundance variations were measured in peat soil and vegetation from two contrasting boreal forest wetlands: an upland watershed basin and a permanently saturated lowland mire. Evidence of methane oxidation was shown in the permanently saturated wetland with deltaC-13 values as low as -97 parts per thousand in carbonate minerals found in floating peat mats. It is postulated that C-13 depleted CH4 is oxidized in the,mat and reacts with calcium ions to form calcite (identified through x-ray diffraction). Methane flux measurements during the summer of 1992 showed much lower fluxes in areas with floating peat mats relative to open water. Secondary carbonates in the        basin peat have isotope compositions close to the deltaC-13 values of the peat organic carbon (25 parts per thousand), indicating their origin from fermentation and possibly from sulfate-reduction. In the upland basin peat deposits, the deltaC-13(PDB) Values of organic C were constant with depth, while the permanently saturated mire had localities of C-13 enrichment in deeper layers of the peat. The C-13 enrichment may reflect areas of intense CH4 production in which C-13 enriched residual substrate is left behind during the production of highly C-13 depleted CH4.

AB We measured methane release into the atmosphere, concentrations and fluxes of dissolved methane, and rates of methane production by peats in two beaver impoundments in the Adirondack Park region of New York to determine whether such impoundments are a significant source of atmospheric methane. In 1990, methane release rates were similar between impoundments and averaged 705 and 600 pmol cm-2 min-1 (i.e. 162 and 138 mg CH4 m-2 d-1). Water-column concentrations of dissolved CH4 were lower in one impoundment (33 muM) than in the other (158 muM). Rates of CH4 production by underlying peats were similar between impoundments and averaged 34.7 and 25.1 pmol cm-3 min-1. In both impoundments, CH4 oxidation in the water and at the sediment-water interface seemed to be an important factor controlling its release. Moss-dominated wetlands adjacent to the impoundments had at least tenfold lower release rates for CH4 and fivefold lower concentrations of dissolved CH4. Beaver impoundments in woodland streams appear to be important local sources of atmospheric CH4. Enhanced CH4 cycling in these systems compared to that in local wetlands could be due to altered hydrology, increased retention of sediment and organic matter caused by beaver activities, or both.

AB In this study, a process-based model (RCG-C) was developed, parameterized and calibrated for studying the annual and seasonal dynamics of the ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in a cutaway peatland (Linnansuo, eastern Finland) cultivated with a perennial bioenergy crop (Phalaris arundinaceae, L., RCG). Based on a number of prior studies and an environmentally controlled experiment, RCG-C emphasized several key processes beyond the generality of previous diplotelmic models for pristine peatlands. These processes included the effects of management (e.g., drainage, peat extraction, tilling, harvesting and fertilization) on the soil hydrology and the cycling of carbon and nitrogen, the influence of climatic factors on photosynthesis and the phenological cycle and phenological and soil-moisture controls on biomass production and canopy development. The model was validated based on continuous measurements of meteorological parameters, energy and CO2 fluxes (eddy covariance system) performed at the site from 2005 to 2010, including variation associated with both wet and dry years. The results showed that the model captured the seasonal and annual trends of the latent heat flux and NEE during the six-year period. Moreover, the simulated values for the total C sink capacity, accumulation of rhizome biomass and peat formation from RCG obtained during the six-year period also agreed well with the field measurements. Based on the FINADAPT climate scenarios, a sensitivity analysis of the model showed that the potential increases in the atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ca) and air temperature (Ta) could be the main forces driving the changes in NEE. The model simulation suggested that the effects of Ta tend to offset those of Ca and lead to a decrease in the total C sink capacity of the site during the main rotation period (4-15th year of cultivation). This decrease tends to become more intensive toward the end of the 21st century. During the period from 2060 to 2099, the total CO2 sink capacity could decrease by 79% during the main rotation period at the Linnansuo site. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Small boreal lakes emit large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Yet emissions of these greenhouse gases are variable in space and time, in part due to variable within-lake CO2 and CH4 concentrations. To determine the extent and the underlying drivers of this variation, we measured lake water CO2 and CH4 concentrations and estimated associated emissions using spatially discrete water samples collected every 2 weeks from a small boreal lake. On select dates, we also collected groundwater samples from the surrounding catchment. On average, groundwater draining a connected peat mire complex had significantly higher CO2 and CH4 concentrations compared to waters draining forest on mineral soils. However, within the lake, only CH4 concentrations nearshore from the mire complex were significantly elevated. We observed little spatial variability in surface water CO2; however, bottom water CO2 in the pelagic zone was significantly higher than bottom waters at nearshore locations. Overall, temperature, precipitation, and thermal stratification explained temporal patterns of CO2 concentration, whereas hydrology (discharge and precipitation) best predicted the variation in CH4 concentration. Consistent with these different controls, the highest CO2 emission was related to lake turnover at the end of August while the highest CH4 emission was associated with precipitation events at the end of June. These results suggest that annual carbon emissions from small boreal lakes are influenced by temporal variation in weather conditions that regulate thermal stratification and trigger hydrologic land-water connections that supply gases from catchment soils to the lake.

AB Feedbacks to global warming may cause terrestrial ecosystems to add to anthropogenic CO2 emissions, thus exacerbating climate change. The contribution that soil respiration makes to these terrestrial emissions, particularly from carbon-rich soils such as peatlands, is of significant importance and its response to changing climatic conditions is of considerable debate. We collected intact soil cores from an upland blanket bog situated within the northern Pennines, England, UK and investigated the individual and interactive effects of three primary controls on soil organic matter decomposition: (i) temperature (5, 10 and 15 degrees C); (ii) moisture (50 and 100% field capacity - FC); and (iii) substrate quality, using increasing depth from the surface (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm) as an analogue for increased recalcitrance of soil organic material. Statistical analysis of the results showed that temperature, moisture and substrate quality all significantly affected rates of peat decomposition. Q(10) values indicated that the temperature sensitivity of older/more recalcitrant soil organic matter significantly increased (relative to more labile peat) under reduced soil moisture (50% FC) conditions, but not under 100% FC, suggesting that soil microorganisms decomposing the more recalcitrant soil material preferred more aerated conditions. Radiocarbon analyses revealed that soil decomposers were able to respire older, more recalcitrant soil organic matter and that the source of the material (deduced from the delta C-13 analyses) subject to decomposition, changed depending on depth in the peat profile.

AB Methane is the second most important anthropogenically produced greenhouse gas, and radiocarbon (C-14) analysis is extremely valuable in identifying its age and source in the environment. At the NERC Radiocarbon Facility (East Kilbride, UK) we have developed expertise in analysis of methane C-14 concentration and methodological approaches to field sampling over the past 20 years. This has opened a wide range of applications, which have mainly focused on (1) the age and source of methane emitted by peatlands and organic soils (e.g. to quantify the release of ancient carbon), (2) the source of aquatic emissions of methane, and (3) the age of methane generated by amenity and illegal landfill. Many of these scientifically important applications involve challenging sampling and measurement considerations, which our development program has continually aimed to overcome. Here, we describe our current methods, and recent improvements to aid field collection of samples in remote locations. We present the results of tests which (1) show the effectiveness of our methods to remove contaminants, especially CO2, (2) quantify the 14 C background contribution, and (3) demonstrate the reliability of metal gas storage canisters for sample storage.

AB Peatlands are a major natural source of atmospheric methane (CH4). Emissions from Sphagnum-dominated mires are lower than those measured from other mire types. This observation may partly be due to methanotrophic (i.e., methane-consuming) bacteria associated with Sphagnum. Twenty-three of the 41 Sphagnum species in Finland can be found in the peatland at Lakkasuo. To better understand the Sphagnum-methanotroph system, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) all these Sphagnum species support methanotrophic bacteria; (2) water level is the key environmental determinant for differences in methanotrophy across habitats; (3) under dry conditions, Sphagnum species will not host methanotrophic bacteria; and (4) methanotrophs can move from one Sphagnum shoot to another in an aquatic environment. To address hypotheses 1 and 2, we measured the water table and CH4 oxidation for all Sphagnum species at Lakkasuo in 1-5 replicates for each species. Using this systematic approach, we included Sphagnum spp. with narrow and broad ecological tolerances. To estimate the potential contribution of CH4 to moss carbon, we measured the uptake of delta C-13 supplied as CH4 or as carbon dioxide dissolved in water. To test hypotheses 2-4, we transplanted inactive moss patches to active sites and measured their methanotroph communities before and after transplantation. All 23 Sphagnum species showed methanotrophic activity, confirming hypothesis 1. We found that water level was the key environmental factor regulating methanotrophy in Sphagnum (hypothesis 2). Mosses that previously exhibited no CH4 oxidation became active when transplanted to an environment in which the microbes in the control mosses were actively oxidizing CH4 (hypothesis 4). Newly active transplants possessed a Methylocystis signature also found in the control Sphagnum spp. Inactive transplants also supported a Methylocystis signature in common with active transplants and control mosses, which rejects hypothesis 3. Our results imply a loose symbiosis between Sphagnum spp. and methanotrophic bacteria that accounts for potentially 10-30% of Sphagnum carbon.

TI Ibuprofen degradation using a Co-doped carbon matrix derived from peat

   catalyst; Pharmaceuticals and personal care products
AB The wider presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in nature is a major cause for concern in society. Among pharmaceuticals, the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen has commonly been found in aquatic and soil environments. We produced a Co-doped carbon matrix (Co-P 850) through the carbonization of Co2+ saturated peat and used it as a peroxymonosulphate activator to aid ibuprofen degradation. The properties of Co-P 850 were analysed using field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy filtered transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The characterization results showed that Co/Fe oxides were generated and tightly embedded into the carbon matrix after carbonization. The degradation results indicated that high temperature and slightly acidic to neutral conditions (pH = 5 to 7.5) promoted ibuprofen degradation efficiency in the Co-P 850/peroxymonosulphate system. Analysis showed that approx. 52% and 75% of the dissolved organic carbon was removed after 2 h and 5 h of reaction time, respectively. Furthermore, the existence of chloride and bicarbonate had adverse effects on the degradation of ibuprofen. Quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis confirmed that SO4 center dot-, (OH)-O-center dot and O-2(center dot-); radicals together contributed to the high ibuprofen degradation efficiency. In addition, we identified 13 degradation intermediate compounds and an ibuprofen degradation pathway by mass spectrometry analysis and quantum computing. Based on the results and methods presented in this study, we propose a novel way for the synthesis of a Co-doped catalyst from spent NaOH-treated peat and the efficient catalytic degradation of ibuprofen from contaminated water.

AB Coastal plains are amongst the most densely populated areas in the world. Many coastal peatlands are drained to create arable land. This is not without consequences; physical compaction of peat and its degradation by oxidation lead to subsidence, and oxidation also leads to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). This study complements existing studies by quantifying total land subsidence and associated CO2 respiration over the past millennium in the Dutch coastal peatlands, to gain insight into the consequences of cultivating coastal peatlands over longer timescales. Results show that the peat volume loss was 19.8 km(3), which lowered the Dutch coastal plain by 1.9 m on average, bringing most of it below sea level. At least 66 % of the volume reduction is the result of drainage, and 34 % was caused by the excavation and subsequent combustion of peat. The associated CO2 respiration is equivalent to a global atmospheric CO2 concentration increase of similar to 0.39 ppmv. Cultivation of coastal peatlands can turn a carbon sink into a carbon source. If the path taken by the Dutch would be followed worldwide, there will be double trouble: globally significant carbon emissions and increased flood risk in a globally important human habitat. The effects would be larger than the historic ones because most of the cumulative Dutch subsidence and peat loss was accomplished with much less efficient techniques than those available now.

AB (1) Cylindrical cores, 30 cm diameter by 40 cm deep, were cut from the living surface of a raised bog and installed in buckets of the same diameter. The cores were kept outdoors, and their natural water levels maintained with distilled water, until transfer to constant temperature rooms for experiments. Gas fluxes and concentration profiles were measured by quadrupole mass spectrometry. (2) Concentration profiles show that there is an intense source of CH4 about 15 cm below the watertable, and that peaks in the profile move up and down with the watertable. The source can be turned on and off in a few hours. (3) The efflux of CHL depends exponentially on (Celsius) temperature, and is 20% greater in light than it is in the dark, even when the surface vegetation is Sphagnum moss without any vascular plants. (4) Efflux from hollow, lawn, and hummock microhabitats depends negatively and linearly on the depth of the watertable. The slope of the relation is almost the same in ail three microhabitats. (5) When Menyanthes trifoliata (bogbean) is present in hollows the efflux is greater than when only Sphagnum is present. The movement of argon shows that the roots and shoots of Menyanthes provide a high-conductance route between the peat and the atmosphere. (6) Field temperature, precipitation and watertable were recorded for a hydrological (Oct-Sept) year on a raised bog in southwest Scotland. Expected efflux of CH4 was calculated using the experimentally determined relations and the measured temperature and watertable. The mean of these calculated values agreed with the mean of measured values, though individual points were scattered. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Global warming and the resultant increase in evapotranspiration might lead to lowered water tables in peatlands and an increase in fire frequency. The objective of this study was to investigate some of the potential effects of these changes on peat decomposition. Dry mass losses and emissions of CO2 and CH4 from peat samples taken from three depth layers (0-10, 10-20, and 30-40 cm) of a black spruce peatland were measured in the laboratory at 8-degrees, 16-degrees, and 24-degrees-C under two moisture treatments. Effects of deep peat fire on decomposition were also simulated by burning the upper layer (0-10 cm) of peat and adding the ash to peat samples from the 10-20 cm layer. CH4 release averaged < 1% of total carbon loss in flooded samples. Release of CO2 was 4-9 times greater from the 0-10 cm layer than from the 30-40 cm layer. After 120 d, the 30-40 cm layer had lost < 1% of its original dry mass in all treatments. Higher temperatures strongly promoted decomposition of samples exposed to drying cycles but had little effect on decomposition of continuously flooded samples. Ash addition had variable effects on CO2 emissions but may have promoted CH4 production.
   It is suggested that in certain situations, global warming may not cause appreciable increases in carbon loss from peat deposits. The results indicate that some deeper peats are resistant to decay even when exposed to warm, aerobic conditions. However, further experimental work is needed to predict the long-term response of peat deposits to changes in water levels in different peatland types.

AB Although the effects of elevated ozone on aboveground carbon (C) assimilation are well understood, its effects on soil C fluxes are less certain. Mesocosms taken from a lowland raised bog in northern England were exposed in open-top chambers for 2 years to ambient air or ambient air plus ozone elevated for 8 h day-1 by an average of 49 ppb in summer and 10 ppb in winter. The effects of elevated ozone on methane emission and ecosystem dark respiration were measured throughout this period, along with soil and plant variables. Methane emissions were significantly reduced, by about 25%, by elevated ozone during midsummer periods of both years, but no significant effect of ozone was found during the winter periods. Dark ecosystem respiration was not significantly affected by elevated ozone. There was no evidence that effects of elevated ozone on methane emissions were mediated through changes in aboveground plant biomass or soil water dissolved organic C concentrations. Our results imply that the increased northern hemisphere background ozone concentrations over the 21st century that are predicted by most models may reduce the rate of increase in methane emissions as the region warms.

AB Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was measured by a chamber technique from June to September, 1994, at five peatland sites where the water table was close to the peat surface, ranging from ombrotrophic bog to minerotrophic fen, near Thompson, Manitoba. NEE measurements were made during three 10-14-day periods, and CO2 exchange relationships with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air and soil temperatures, and water table were used to model net ecosystem productivity (NEP) for the season. Daily NEE ranged from -3 to 5 g CO2-C m(2) d(-1), with positive values indicating uptake by the land surface. Two of the sites became sources of CO2 during the late summer, associated with plant senescence and falling water tables. Average NEP for lune to August ranged from 1.4 to 2.5 g CO2-C m(-2) d(-1). Both water table position and end-of-season above-ground sedge biomass were strong predictors of NEP during each measurement period as well as over the lune to August period Sites with high NEP had high aboveground sedge biomass (75 to 100 g m(-2)) and low water tables (seasonal average -5 to -10 cm).

AB We analysed the effect of the 2018 European drought on greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange of five North European mire ecosystems. The low precipitation and high summer temperatures in Fennoscandia led to a lowered water table in the majority of these mires. This lowered both carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake and methane (CH4) emission during 2018, turning three out of the five mires from CO(2)sinks to sources. The calculated radiative forcing showed that the drought-induced changes in GHG fluxes first resulted in a cooling effect lasting 15-50 years, due to the lowered CH(4)emission, which was followed by warming due to the lower CO(2)uptake. This article is part of the theme issue 'Impacts of the 2018 severe drought and heatwave in Europe: from site to continental scale'.

AB Wetland stores substantial amount of carbon and may contribute greatly to global climate change debate. However, few researches have focused on the effects of global climate change on carbon mineralization in Zoig alpine wetland, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which is one of the most important peatlands in China. Through incubation experiment, this paper studied the effects of temperature, soil moisture, soil type (marsh soil and peat soil) and their interactions on CO2 and CH4 emission rates in Zoig alpine wetland. Results show that when the temperature rises from 5A degrees C to 35A degrees C, CO2 emission rates increase by 3.3-3.7 times and 2.4-2.6 times under non-inundation treatment, and by 2.2-2.3 times and 4.1-4.3 times under inundation treatment in marsh soil and peat soil, respectively. Compared with non-inundation treatment, CO2 emission rates decrease by 6%-44%, 20%-60% in marsh soil and peat soil, respectively, under inundation treatment. CO2 emission rate is significantly affected by the combined effects of the temperature and soil type (p < 0.001), and soil moisture and soil type (p < 0.001), and CH4 emission rate was significantly affected by the interaction of the temperature and soil moisture (p < 0.001). Q (10) values for CO2 emission rate are higher at the range of 5A degrees C-25A degrees C than 25A degrees C-35A degrees C, indicating that carbon mineralization is more sensitive at low temperature in Zoig alpine wetland.

AB Net CO, exchange measured under well-mixed atmospheric conditions in four different mires in Sweden and Finland were used to analyse which factors were controlling photosynthesis and respiration. The parameters of a light response function showed strong seasonal variations with similar behaviour for all mires. The half-monthly nighttime respiration rates in the central part of the growing season were about two times higher in the southernmost, warmest site. Faje. as compared to the northernmost, coldest site, Kaamanen. However. Kaamanen had high photosynthesis rates, and this in combination with the long daylight periods in the middle of the summer caused Kaamanen to have the largest net ecosystem exchange (NEE) during the summer period. Faje that showed the highest productivity had also the highest respiration and therefore. the lowest NEE during summer. Correlation between half-monthly components and different environmental variables showed the highest correlation between the components themselves. Thereafter came temperature except for Faje where water table depth (WTD) explained most of the variance both for detrended and temperature-normalized components. All sites showed dependencies between WTD and the respective components during drying up periods. Temperature sensitivity was higher for productivity than for respiration indicating that CO uptake would increase during global warming.

AB Vascular plants may reduce episodic ebullition losses of methane (CH4) from peatlands. They transport CH4 to the atmosphere, which may lead to a reduction in pore-water [CH4], bubble formation and release. This effect may be compounded by rhizospheric oxidation and associated methanotrophy. However, any reduction in pore-water [CH4] may be countered by root exudation (substrate for methanogens). The aim of this study was to determine how the presence of sedges affects CH4 emissions from peatlands.
   Five pairs of peat cores were collected from a raised bog. One of each pair contained Sphagnum cuspidatum and Eriophorum angustifolium ('sedge' cores); the other was dominated by S. cuspidatum ('no-sedge'). From these the total CH4 efflux-including that due to episodic ebullition-were measured. A partial-shading treatment helped isolate the potential effect of root exudation.
   Sedge samples had significantly higher CH4 fluxes than no-sedge samples, but episodic-ebullition fluxes were not significantly different. Between full-light and partially-shaded conditions, there was a significant increase in the difference in CH4 fluxes between the sedge and no-sedge cores.
   The higher rates of CH4 flux from the sedge cores cannot be explained simply by higher rates of CH4 production due to rapid utilisation of exudates.

AB The short-term effects of N addition on CH4 oxidation in a drained peat soil were investigated by incubation of peat material from fertilized and unfertilized plots in the laboratory. CH4 oxidation was observed only in the surface depth interval (0-5 cm) of the peat profile. Rate constants as high as -0.084 h(-1) g(-1)d.w. were measured. Fertilization affected the magnitude of the reaction rate constants with the greatest inhibition observed in those samples that were amended with NH4Cl. KNO3 and urea addition resulted in less inhibition. A weak temperature effect on CH4 consumption was observed. Apparent activation energies (E(a)' were measured at - 54 to - 16 kJ mol(-1). Only the addition of KNO3 significantly affected the temperature response of the surface peats. The nitrogen fertilizers had also decreased the CH4 uptake in situ. However, our study showed that the effect is not simply dependent upon NH4+ concentrations, e.g. the added salts, K+ and Cl-, might possibly contribute to the inhibitory effect.

AB Peatlands are a critical carbon store comprising 30% of the Earth's terrestrial soil carbon. Sphagnum mosses comprise up to 90% of peat in the northern hemisphere but impacts of climate change on Sphagnum mosses are poorly understood, limiting development of sustainable peatland management and restoration. This study investigates the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) (800ppm) and hydrology on the growth of Sphagnum fallax, Sphagnum capillifolium and Sphagnum papillosum and greenhouse gas fluxes from moss-peat mesocosms. Elevated CO2 levels increased Sphagnum height and dry weight but the magnitude of the response differed among species. The most responsive species, S. fallax, yielded the most biomass compared to S. papillosum and S. capillifolium. Water levels and the CO2 treatment were found to interact, with the highest water level (1cm below the surface) seeing the largest increase in dry weight under eCO(2) compared to ambient (400ppm) concentrations. Initially, CO2 flux rates were similar between CO2 treatments. After week9 there was a consistent three-fold increase of the CO2 sink strength under eCO(2). At the end of the experiment, S. papillosum and S. fallax were greater sinks of CO2 than S. capillifolium and the -7cm water level treatment showed the strongest CO2 sink strength. The mesocosms were net sources of CH4 but the source strength varied with species, specifically S. fallax produced more CH4 than S. papillosum and S. capillifolium. Our findings demonstrate the importance of species selection on the outcomes of peatland restoration with regards to Sphagnum's growth and GHG exchange.

AB Natural peatlands accumulate carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). They affect the global climate by binding carbon dioxide (CO2) and releasing methane (CH4) to the atmosphere; in contrast fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) in natural peatlands are insignificant. Changes in drainage associated with forestry alter these greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and thus the radiative forcing (RF) of peatlands. In this paper, changes in peat and tree stand C stores, GHG fluxes and the consequent RF of Finnish undisturbed and forestry-drained peatlands are estimated for 1900-2100. The C store in peat is estimated at 5.5 Pg in 1950. The rate of C sequestration into peat has increased from 2.2 Tg a(-1) in 1900, when all peatlands were undrained, to 3.6 Tg a(--1) at present, when c . 60% of peatlands have been drained for forestry. The C store in tree stands has increased from 60 to 170 Tg during the 20th century. Methane emissions have decreased from an estimated 1.0-0.5 Tg CH4-C a(-1) , while those of N2O have increased from 0.0003 to 0.005 Tg N-2 O-N a(-1). The altered exchange rates of GHG gases since 1900 have decreased the RF of peatlands in Finland by about 3 mW m(--2) from the predrainage situation. This result contradicts the common hypothesis that drainage results in increased C emissions and therefore increased RF of peatlands. The negative radiative forcing due to drainage is caused by increases in CO2 sequestration in peat (-0.5 mW m(-2)), tree stands and wood products (-0.8 mW m(2) ), decreases in CH4 emissions from peat to the atmosphere (-1.6 mW m(-2)), and only a small increase in N2O emissions (+0.1 mW m(-2) ). Although the calculations presented include many uncertainties, the above results are considered qualitatively reliable and may be expected to be valid also for Scandinavian countries and Russia, where most forestry-drained peatlands occur outside Finland.

AB Fluxes of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and respired CO2 were measured with an automated chamber system (SIGMA) over the autumn of 2009 and growing season of 2010 in an undisturbed peatland with a floating carpet of mosses in western Poland. The main goal of our investigation was to deliver estimations of CH4 and N2O emission rates for this unique peatland type in Central Europe. CO2 and CH4 fluxes were also measured using a non-steady-state-flow-through manual chamber systems equipped with infrared gas analyzers and used to validate and adjust results obtained with the SIGMA system. The average methane fluxes for the 2009-2010 (excluding winter) period was 95.4 (+/- 32.4) mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) resulting in a cumulative CH4 emission of 23.4 (+/- 2.4) g CH4-C m(-2) A day growing season and 29.2 (+/- 3.2) g CH4-C m(-2) year(-1) for the whole of 2010. The average seasonal N2O fluxes were 13.6 (+/- 28.2) mu g N2O-N m(-2) d(-1). N2O fluxes were highly variable in time and sign (both uptake and emissions of N2O were observed during the accumulation periods). Maximum estimates of the annual emission rates of N2O were 0.004 g N2O-N m(-2) year(-1). Methane fluxes correlated significantly with the air and peat temperatures, but they were not dependent on water table depth. The N2O fluxes did not demonstrate a clear response to any environmental variables. Both CH4 and N2O emission rates were in the range of fluxes recorded in pristine peatlands in other climatic zones.

AB Rewetting drained peatlands creates favorable reduced conditions for denitrification, but, the potential of restored peatlands to act as N2O sink is poorly characterized. We monitored N2O emissions in rewetted peatlands converted to rice paddies with a range of soil organic carbon (SOC) (6%, 11%, and 23%) during the growing season. Negative N2O emissions were repeatedly observed in all sites, which were not affected by nitrogen fertilization at 80 kg N ha(-1). The highest consumption rates amounted to 8.2 tones CO2 eq ha(-1) yr(-1), 32% of the average CO2 emissions from drained peat soils. Porewater N2O concentrations were frequently less than the calculated in situ N2O equilibrium concentrations, suggesting diffusional constraints on atmospheric N2O into pore water. Redox potentials were correlated to N2O emission rates (r(2) = 0.40, p < 0.01). However, relatively higher frequencies and magnitudes of negative N2O emissions were mostly observed during the period of water draw down for rice harvest activities, especially in the field with the highest SOC. It is likely that reducing water depth by drainage reduced the diffusional barrier for atmospheric N2O into the soil. In all, the capacity of rewetted peatlands to act as atmospheric N2O sinks can be significant and seemingly can be managed through manipulating water depths. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Boreal peatlands, a major source of atmospheric CH4, are characterized by a rapidly fluctuating water table position and meter-scale variations in relief. Regional and ecosystem-based studies show that water table position generally controls CH4 emission from boreal peatlands by influencing the relative extent of the zones of CH4 oxidation and production within the peat profile. We used a combined field and laboratory study to assess the influence of local hydrology on the short-term dynamics of CH4 production, oxidation, and emission from sites in an Alaskan boreal peatland that were characterized by temporarily (site LB1A) and permanently (LB2) water-saturated subsurface peat during the thaw season. The two sites contrasted sharply with respect to the dynamics of CH4 cycling. Site LB1A, which showed low CH4 concentrations in pore water (<2 mu M) and unsaturated peat (<2.6 nM), consumed both atmospheric CH4 and CH4 diffusing upward from the saturated zone for a net flux of 0.9 mg CH4 m(2) d(1). In contrast, LB2 had pore water CH4 concentrations, 300 mu M and emitted CH4 at 69 mg m(2) d(1). Roughly 55% of the CH4 diffusing upward from the saturated zone at LB2 was oxidized in transit to the peat surface. Methane oxidation potentials (V-ox) were maximum in the 10-cm zone immediately above the local water table at both sites but were greater on a dry mass (dw) basis at LB2 (498-650 ng CH4 g(dw)(1) h(1)) than at LB1A (220-233 ng CH4 g(dw)(1) h(1)). Methane production potentials (V-p) were low (<2 ng CH4 g(dw)(1) h(1)) at LB1A, but the maximum at LB2 (139 ng CH4 g(dw)(1) h(1)) was spatially coupled with the maximum V-ox. Methanogens exposed to O-2 produced no CH4 in a subsequent 48 h anoxic incubation, whereas methanotrophs incubated anoxically oxidized CH4 vigorously within 20 h of return to an oxic environment, indicating that the former are more sensitive than the latter to adverse O-2 conditions. Experiments with (CH4)-C-14 showed that similar to 71% of assimilated (CH4)-C-14 was respired as (CO2)-C-14. Respiration by methanotrophs contributes at most similar to 1.1-1.7% (molar basis) of gross ecosystem respiration (15.6-17.9 mg CO2 m(2) d(1)) at these sites.

AB We report on methane (CH4) concentrations and efflux densities that were measured over a drained and grazed, peatland pasture in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta of California over a three year period. The site was ideal for micrometeorological flux measurements due to its very flat topography, its exposure to vigorous winds and its extended fetch along the predominant wind direction. Nevertheless, the interpretation of methane fluxes with eddy covariance proved to be extremely complicated by a number of geographical, biophysical, biogeochemical and site management factors.
   Initial inspection of the data revealed unexpected results methane concentrations and efflux densities were greatest during the night rather than during the day. To explain this odd diurnal behavior in methane efflux densities and concentration, we tested two hypotheses. The prime hypothesis presupposed that the stable stratification of the nocturnal boundary layer elongated the flux footprint and enabled the flux tower to sense wetter fields at the western edge of the pasture, flooded drainage ditches, and/or a tidal marsh upwind of the pasture these land forms emitted methane at rates 10-100 times greater than the drained portion of the peatland. And, this methane was emitted into a shallower volume of the atmosphere due to the collapse of the nocturnal boundary layer, causing methane concentrations to rise faster. The alternative hypothesis attributed the higher nocturnal methane fluxes to cattle, as they may have congregated near the tower at night.
   We investigated these hypotheses with: (1) a series of micrometeorological field measurements at companion sites upwind and downwind of the pasture; (2) a series of chamber-based flux measurements on the representative land classes; (3) through the lens of a one-dimensional planetary boundary layer (pbl), box model; and (4) via inspection of digital camera images for the presence or absence of cattle. Together, these pieces of data suggest that elevated methane fluxes and concentrations at night were due to the combined correlation between: (1) the collapse of the nocturnal boundary layer; (2) the elongation of the flux and concentration footprints; and (3) the preferential sampling of an elevated methane source, be it the cattle, wet proportions of the field or some combination. On the other hand, our flux measurements were not perturbed by methane emanating from the tidal marsh that was several kilometers upwind of the peatland pasture site. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Decomposition of organic materials, oxygen consumption, and carbon dioxide emission were investigated in Masukata raire, a small minerotrophic mire in central Japan. We selected three dominant community types in the mire, a Sphagnum palustre community, a Phragmites australis community, and an Alnus japonica community, for the decomposition study sites. Decomposition rates were measured in the field by examining mass loss of peat and cellulose for 6 months. The oxygen consumption rate was measured in the field using a closed chamber equipped with an oxygen electrode. The carbon dioxide emission rate of the peat was measured by an infrared gas analyser in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Results of these measurements were tested by correlation analysis. The rate of mass loss of peat positively correlated with the CO2 emission rate. The cellulose decomposition rate showed significant differences among community types, and it had significant positive correlation with the oxygen consumption rate. Although oxygen consumption measurement is not generally used to estimate peatland soil respiration, the oxygen consumption method can be used for predicting long-term decomposition rate according to different vegetation types within a short time.

AB Forestry drainage is a method used extensively to grow timber in peat soils in Finland. Following drainage, the developing tree stand influences methane (CH,) emissions by altering plant and microbial communities through water-level drawdown, competition for nutrients and shading. Therefore there should be a close correlation between tree stand volume and CH4 fluxes in drained peatlands. We used previously published material along with data collected in this research programme to assess the potential of tree stand volume as a tool for estimating CH4 fluxes for drained peatland forests, and to quantify this relationship under conditions prevailing in Finland. There was a clear negative exponential relationship between tree stand volumes and CH 4 emissions. Sites with small stand volume emitted CH4 after drainage (up to 4 9 CH4 m(-2) a(-1)), while larger stands consumed it (up to 1 g CH4 m (-2) a(-1)); the turning point from source to sink was about 140 m(3) ha(-1). Similar relationships were also found for undrained mires, although not as clearly as for the drained sites. Since drained peatland forests in Finland are generally rather young in drainage age and small in stand volumes, they are still estimated to emit CH 4 to the atmosphere, although the rate has substantially decreased after drainage.

AB Peatlands occupy a relatively small fraction of the Earth's land area, but they are a globally important carbon store because of their high carbon density. Undisturbed peatlands are currently a weak carbon sink (similar to 0.1 Pg C y(-1)), a moderate source of methane (CH4; similar to 0.03 Pg CH4 y(-1)), and a very weak source of nitrous oxide (N2O; similar to 0.00002 Pg N2O-N y(-1)). Anthropogenic disturbance, primarily agriculture and forestry drainage (10%-20% of global peatlands), results in net CO2 emissions, reduced CH4 emissions, and increased N2O emissions. This likely changes the global peatland greenhouse gas balance to a C source (similar to 0.1 Pg C y(-1)), a 10% smaller CH4 source, and a larger (but still small) N2O source (similar to 0.0004 Pg N2O-N y(-1)). There is no strong evidence that peatlands significantly contributed to 20th century changes in the atmospheric burden of CO2, CH4, or N2O; will this picture change in the 21st century? A review of experimental and observational studies of peatland dynamics indicates that the main global change impacts on peatlands that may have significant climate impacts are (1) drainage, especially in the tropics; (2) widespread permafrost thaw; and (3) increased fire intensity and frequency as a result of drier climatic conditions and (or) drainage. Quantitative estimates of global change impacts are limited by the sparse field data (particularly in the tropics), the large variability present in existing data, uncertainties in the future trajectory of peatland use, interactive effects of individual impacts, and the unprecedented rates of climate change expected in the 21st century.

AB Microbes involved in decomposition within peatlands and the conditions that influence their activities have implications for C and greenhouse gas exchange. The objectives of this research were to characterize the role of fungal and bacterial activities in peatlands using selective antibiotic inhibition techniques across a nutrient gradient (rich to poor fens) and to search for environmental controls on the activity of each group. Bacterial activities predominated across a range of rich to poor boreal peatlands in central Ontario, Canada, although fungal activity became increasingly important in the poor sites. Linkages between soil pH and nutrient status and fungal and bacterial activities were found. However, they did not confirm our initial hypotheses that bacterial activity would be low in poor sites due to proton stress and low nutrient (particularly N) availability, whereas, fungal activity would be low in rich sites due to increased competitive ability of bacteria under near neutral pH conditions and high nutrient availability. Further work across these sites aimed at characterizing the phylogeny of the rhizosphere fungi is needed to determine if increased presence of mycorrhizae in poor sites could have explained our observed patterns. However, regardless of fungal: bacterial activity ratio differences across sites and its associated controls, microbial CO2 production rates across fen types did not vary significantly, suggesting that the proportion of bacteria and fungi may not matter to broader carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions in peat soils.

AB Sphagnum peatlands are important ecosystems in the methane cycle. Methanotrophs in these ecosystems have been shown to reduce methane emissions and provide additional carbon to Sphagnum mosses. However, little is known about the diversity and identity of the methanotrophs present in and on Sphagnum mosses in these peatlands. In this study, we applied a pmoA microarray and high-throughput 454 pyrosequencing to pmoA PCR products obtained from total DNA from Sphagnum mosses from a Dutch peat bog to investigate the presence of methanotrophs and to compare the two different methods. Both techniques showed comparable results and revealed an abundance of Methylomonas and Methylocystis species in the Sphagnum mosses. The advantage of the microarray analysis is that it is fast and cost-effective, especially when many samples have to be screened. Pyrosequencing is superior in providing pmoA sequences of many unknown or uncultivated methanotrophs present in the Sphagnum mosses and, thus, provided much more detailed and quantitative insight into the microbial diversity.

AB Land-use change in peatlands affects important drivers of CH4 emission such as groundwater level and nutrient availability. Due to the high spatial and temporal variability of such environmental drivers, it is hard to make good predictions of CH4 emissions in the context of land-use changes. Here, we used plant species composition as a stable integrator of environmental drivers of CH4 emissions. We used weighted averaging regression and calibration to make a direct link between plant species composition and CH4 flux in an effort to predict values of CH4 emission for a land-use gradient in two extensive peatland sites. Our predicted CH4 emissions showed good fit with observed values. Additionally, we showed that a quick characterization of vegetation composition, by the dominant species only, provides equally good predictions of CH4 emissions. The use of mean groundwater level alone for predicting emissions showed the same predictive power as our models. However, water level showed strong variability in time. Furthermore, the inverse relationship between water level and CH4 emission can lead to higher errors in predictions at sites with higher CH4 emission. The performance of our model was comparable with those of mechanistic models developed for natural wetland ecosystems. However, such mechanistic models require complex input parameters that are rarely available. We propose the use of plant species composition as a simple and effective alternative for deriving predictions of CH4 emissions in peatlands in the context of land-use change.

AB We have analyzed decade-long methane flux data set from a boreal fen, Siikaneva, together with data on environmental parameters and carbon dioxide exchange. The methane flux showed seasonal cycle but no systematic diel cycle. The highest fluxes were observed in July-August with average value of 73 nmol m(-2) s(-1). Wintertime fluxes were small but positive, with January-March average of 6.7 nmol m(-2) s(-1). Daily average methane emission correlated best with peat temperatures at 20-35 cm depths. The second highest correlation was with gross primary production (GPP). The best correspondence between emission algorithm and measured fluxes was found for a variable-slope generalized linear model (r(2) = 0.89) with peat temperature at 35 cm depth and GPP as explanatory variables, slopes varying between years. The homogeneity of slope approach indicated that seasonal variation explained 79% of the sum of squares variation of daily average methane emission, the interannual variation in explanatory factors 7.0%, functional change 5.3%, and random variation 9.1%. Significant correlation between interannual variability of growing season methane emission and that of GPP indicates that on interannual time scales GPP controls methane emission variability, crucially for development of process-based methane emission models. Annual methane emission ranged from 6.0 to 14 gC m(-2) and was 2.7 +/- 0.4% of annual GPP. Over 10-year period methane emission was 18% of net ecosystem exchange as carbon. The weak relation of methane emission to water table position indicates that space-to-time analogy, used to extrapolate spatial chamber data in time, may not be applicable in seasonal time scales.

AB As the global climate changes so will the balance of carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration and release from peatlands. The changes occurring within peatlands will be complex, making their future carbon (C) responses difficult to predict. We studied three boreal fen peatlands along a nutrient gradient in northern Ontario, Canada. Specifically, we investigated how abiotic and biotic responses of the fens interacted with seasonal and annual hydrologic variability. We further assessed the role that a local disturbance, such as inundation due to beaver dams, has in confounding fen C dynamics. We conducted these assessments by applying the process-based model Wetland-DNDC, which we parameterized, calibrated and corroborated with field data, to examine how C dynamics were affected by fen type (rich, intermediate and poor), historical and projected climate and local flooding disturbance. We found inter-annual variability in greenhouse gas (CO2 and methane, CH4) dynamics to be large among fens, with larger coefficients of variation for heterotrophic respiration and CH4 effluxes (a range of 40-85% and 31-58%, respectively) than gross primary production (a range of 9-26%). This annual variability in C effluxes correlated to meteorological conditions and water table, although the specific drivers differed among fens. Scenarios of prolonged flooding and drought had opposite effects on C effluxes. Drought increased CO2 efflux by 43%, 175% and 65% for rich, intermediate and poor fens, respectively, and decreased CH4 efflux by 11% and 14% for the intermediate and poor, but increased CH4 efflux by 19% for the rich fen. In contrast, shallow flooding decreased CO2 by 40%, 72% and 57% in the rich, intermediate and poor fen, and increased CH4 effluxes by 87%, 202% and 269%, respectively. Flooding by beaver dams during a prolonged drought moderately decreased CO2 (29%, 66% and 53%) but strongly increased CH4 efflux by 121%, 261% and 333%, respectively, than the flooding only. We conclude that the interacting controls on greenhouse gas dynamics differ among fens types, contributing to the magnitude of effluxes and their response to changing conditions. We propose that effects of water table level, peat nutrient status, and vegetation composition, and their interactions, on C processes require enhanced understanding to define natural ranges of spatial and temporal variability. Only then will it be possible to adequately predict future peatland C responses to climate and other environmental changes. As such, short-term experimental results or field studies should not be used to predict future peatland C dynamics without an understanding of the natural range of variation in the environmental drivers and the response of C processes to those drivers.

AB Peatlands characteristically accumulate organic matter due to low decomposition rates, but peatland disturbance alters local physicochemical conditions often resulting in loss of soil organic matter and emission of CO2. Restoration may reduce peat oxidation, but traditional measurements of decomposition are time-consuming. The Tea Bag Index (TBI) is a simple, standardized method to measure decomposition rates in soils. We used the TBI to measure decomposition rate at four restored peatland sites across Canada that were used for peat extraction or disturbed by oil extraction (former well-sites), comparing to undisturbed and unrestored sites. We measured environmental conditions including soil temperature, water table position and peat pH from May to August 2016. Litter bags were buried for one year alongside tea bags at one site for a direct comparison of decomposition rates between the methods. There were no significant differences for TBI decay constant (k(TBI)) between treatments of restored, unrestored or undisturbed sites across the whole data set, but some differences were found among treatments within the same peatland site for sections restored at different times in the past. Soil temperature, pH, and water table were not significantly related to k(TBI), but were negatively correlated with the stabilization factor (S). The k(TBI) and litter bag k were significantly different but positively correlated. The TBI is not easily comparable to traditional litter bags, but is less costly in both time and money, and may be used in conjunction with additional parameters to determine decomposition patterns with potential for use as a metric for evaluating restoration outcomes.

AB Methane (CH4) emissions were measured over two snow-free seasons from ten natural minerotrophic peatlands in the northern boreal zone of Finland using a static chamber technique. The daily CH4 fluxes at the sites ranged from -2.9 to 790mg m(-2) d(-1). At nine wet fens, representing three ecological peatland classes, the seasonal mean CH4 emissions were 8.1-250mgm(-2) d(-1) during a dry summer, and 15-330 mg m(-2) d(-1) during a wet summer. At these sites, the mean CH4 emission correlated positively with the mean water table level (r(2) = 0.64). The driest site (herb-grass spruce mire) showed the lowest CH4 emissions, with the seasonal averages being below 1 mg m(-2) d(-1). The CH4 emissions from these natural northern boreal peatlands in the main aapa-mire zone were similar or higher than those reported from other boreal peatlands in Finland and elsewhere, probably attributable to the high fertility and moisture of the northern boreal sites, characteristics typical of peatlands in the aapa-mire zone. Thus, the aapa mires in the boreal zone in Fennoscandia, Canada and Russia should be a larger natural source for atmospheric CH4 than estimated in the global inventories for wetland CH4 emissions.

AB Large areas of northern peatlands have been drained and afforested with conifers in the 20th century. This has led to changes in the hydrology of the peatlands, the quality and quantity of organic matter inputs and soil microbial communities, which are all likely to impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. Considerable areas of these forest plantations are undergoing restoration, and our aim was to assess whether contrasting compositions of peat, in conjunction with hydrological changes in a controlled lab experiment, impact on GHG fluxes. We incubated vegetation free cores (at 8 degrees C) from a near-natural bog, restoration sites felled in 1998, 2006, 2012 and a current forest plantation at (a) low water tables, (b) high tables or (c) water tables that were changed from low to high. Results show that peat quality and nutrient availability in the pore water have been altered by the forest plantations, which resulted in dissimilar carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes between the sites under the same temperature and water table conditions. Higher CO2 fluxes were found in the peat cores from the forest plantations than from sites that have undergone restoration and from the near-natural bog. However, there were few differences in methane (CH4) fluxes from the different sites, indicating that on its own (i.e., in the absence of biotic interactions under field conditions) the effects of forestry on CH4 flux are limited.

AB Peatlands are large terrestrial stores of carbon, and sustained CO2 sinks, but over the last century large areas have been drained for agriculture and forestry, potentially converting them into net carbon sources. More recently, some peatlands have been re-wetted by blocking drainage ditches, with the aims of enhancing biodiversity, mitigating flooding, and promoting carbon storage. One potential detrimental consequence of peatland re-wetting is an increase in methane (CH4) emissions, offsetting the benefits of increased CO2 sequestration. We examined differences in CH4 emissions between an area of ditch-drained blanket bog, and an adjacent area where drainage ditches were recently infilled. Results showed that Eriophorum vaginatum colonization led to a "hotspot'' of CH4 emissions from the infilled ditches themselves, with smaller increases in CH4 from other re-wetted areas. Extrapolated to the area of blanket bog surrounding the study site, we estimated that CH4 emissions were around 60 kg CH4 ha(-1) y(-1) prior to drainage, reducing to 44 kg CH4 ha(-1) y(-1) after drainage. We calculated that fully re-wetting this area would initially increase emissions to a peak of around 120 kg CH4 ha(-1) y(-1), with around two-thirds of the increase (and 90% of the increase over pre-drainage conditions) attributable to CH4 emissions from E. vaginatum-colonized infilled ditches, despite these areas only occupying 7% of the landscape. We predicted that emissions should eventually decline toward pre-drainage values as the ecosystem recovers, but only if Sphagnum mosses displace E. vaginatum from the infilled ditches. These results have implications for peatland management for climate change mitigation, suggesting that restoration methods should aim, if possible, to avoid the colonization of infilled ditches by aerenchymatous species such as E. vaginatum, and to encourage Sphagnum establishment.

AB To establish the temporal and spatial variability of substrate contribution to ecosystem respiration (ER), we measured the seasonal and inter-annual microbial carbon dioxide (CO2) production potential, microbial biomass, and nitrogen dynamics over a period of 2 years in the upper 30 cm of a peat bog in southern Ontario. Samples collected during a warmer year with lower average summer water table position had larger inorganic and organic nitrogen (N) concentrations and microbial CO2 production potentials. Across all sampling dates, the distance of the water table beneath the surface was significantly and positively correlated with N availability, and in turn N availability was significantly and positively correlated with CO2 production, although direct correlation between water table position and CO2 production was only significant at P = 0.1. Inter-seasonal variability in CO2 production, microbial biomass, or N did not follow consistent patterns between years, and inorganic N species, particularly nitrate, concentrations varied relatively the most between sampling dates, although concentrations were always small relative to microbial biomass N and potassium sulfate-extractable organic N. Microbial CO2 production from the surface peat profile was calculated to be between 2.5 and 5.7 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1). Data extrapolation showed that microbial production Of CO2 can be between 41 and 67% of the CO2 emitted as ER with the larger value falling in a warmer, drier year and that inter-annual changes in production potentials may partially explain increased ER in warmer, drier years. These results suggest that changes in microbial CO2 production and microbial community and nutrient characteristics may play an important role in controlling the emission Of CO2 from terrestrial ecosystems such as peatlands.

AB 1The vertical and horizontal dynamics of peat carbon accumulation in Ruosuo aapa mire, north-central Finland, were investigated in an attempt to understand variations in carbon accumulation over time.
   2 Paludification began around 8700 BP (9600 cal BP). The long-term net carbon accumulation rate, based on vertical and lateral growth, was 8.0 g C m(-2) year(-1). Variations in carbon accumulation rates can be explained to a great extent by natural succession and variations in local conditions, but the role of climate cannot be ignored.
   3 The marked decline in carbon accumulation rates after 6100 BP (7000 cal BP) may indicate a relatively dry and warm climate. The levelling out and subsequent increase in carbon accumulation rates after 4000 BP (4500 cal BP) indicates the development of a cooler and moister climate.
   4 The low long-term net carbon accumulation rate and the high carbon content per unit volume in the layer underlying the surficial peat is typical for a wet aapa mire. The continuous penetration of roots, mostly sedge, results in carbon input into the underlying peat layer and contributes to the intensive decay of the surficial peat due to high biological activity.
   5 Although one-third of the apparent carbon has accumulated during the last 2000 years, most of Ruosuo is approaching the stage where primary production does not adequately compensate for overall carbon loss. The declining net carbon accumulation rates from the base up to the depth of 80 cm may indicate a real delayed trend in net carbon accumulation rates.
   6 We suggest that under the present climatic conditions the northern circumpolar wet mires are significant sources of greenhouse gases. In addition to high methane production, northern aapa mires also have lower carbon accumulation rates than more southern raised bogs.
   7 Our results, which are based on horizontal and vertical carbon accumulation rates, suggest that the earlier published carbon accumulation rates in Finnish aapa mires are overestimated.

AB Laboratory columns (80 cm long, 10 cm diameter) of peat were constructed from samples collected from a subarctic fen, a temperate bog and a temperate swamp. Temperature and water table position were manipulated to establish their influence on emissions of CO2 and CH4 from the columns. A factorial design experiment revealed significant (P < 0.05) differences in emission of these gases related to peat type, temperature and water table position, as well as an interaction between temperature and water table. Emissions of CO2 and CH4 at 23-degrees-C were an average of 2.4 and 6.6 times larger, respectively, than those at 10-degrees-C. Compared to emissions when the columns were saturated, water table at a depth of 40 cm increased CO2 fluxes by an average of 4.3 times and decreased CH4 emissions by an average of 5.0 times. There were significant temporal variations in gas emissions during the 6-week experiment, presumably related to variations in microbial populations and substrate availability. Using columns with static water table depths of 0, 10, 20, 40 and 60 cm, CO2 emissions showed a positive, linear relation with depth, whereas CH4 emissions revealed a negative, logarithmic relation with depth. Lowering and then raising the water table from the peat surface to a depth of 50 cm revealed weak evidence of hysteresis in CO2 emissions between the falling and rising water table limbs. Hysteresis (falling > rising limb) was very pronounced for CH4 emissions, attributed to a release of CH4 stored in pore-water and a lag in the development of anaerobic conditions and methanogenesis on the rising limb. Decreases in atmospheric pressure were correlated with abnormally large emissions of CO2 and CH4 on the falling limb. Peat slurries incubated in flasks revealed few differences between the three peat types in the rates of CO2 production under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. There were, however, major differences between peat types in the rates of CH4 consumption under aerobic incubation conditions and CH4 production under anaerobic conditions (bog > fen > swamp), which explain the differences in response of the peat types in the column experiment.

AB Peatlands are one of the major natural sources of methane (CH4), but the level of CH4 efflux is uncertain, especially in alpine peatlands. In this study, CH4 emission fluxes from natural and drained peatlands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, southwest China, were measured from June to October in 2013 using the opaque static chamber technique and the Fast Greenhouse Gas Analyzer (DLT-100, Los Gatos Research Corp.). CH4 emission fluxes ranged from 2.07 to 56.33 mg m(-2) h(-1) in natural peatlands and from 0.02 to 0.42 mg m(-2) h(-1) in drained peatlands. Mean CH4 emission flux was 19.13 mg m(-2) h(-1) in natural peatlands and 0.14 mg m(-2) h(-1) in drained peatlands. These results showed that drainage led to a significant decrease in CH4 emissions. CH4 emission fluxes for all sampling plots were significantly correlated with variation in water table depth for linear (R (2) = 0.453, P < 0.01) and exponential functions (R (2) = 0.429, P < 0.01).

AB Drained organic soils are among the most risky soil types as far as their greenhouse gas emissions are considered. Reed canary grass (RCG) is a potential bioenergy crop in the boreal region, but the atmospheric impact of its cultivation is unknown. The fluxes of N2O and CH4 were measured from an abandoned peat extraction site (an organic soil) cultivated with RCG using static chamber and snow gradient techniques. The fluxes were measured also at an adjacent site which is under active peat extraction and it is devoid of any vegetation (BP site). The 4-year average annual N2O emissions were low being 0.1 and 0.01 g N2O m(-2) a(-1) at the RCG and BP sites, respectively. The corresponding mean annual CH4 emissions from the RCG and BP sites were also low (0.4 g and 0.9 g CH4 m(-2) a(-1)). These results highlight for the first time that there are organic soils where cultivation of perennial bioenergy crops is possible with low N2O and CH4 emissions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Peatlands are carbon-accumulating wetland ecosystems, developed through an imbalance among organic matter production and decomposition processes. Soil saturation is the principal cause of anoxic conditions that constrain organic matter decay. Accordingly, changes in the hydrologic regime will affect the carbon (C) dynamics in forested peatlands. Our objective is to review ecological studies and experiments on managed peatlands that provide a basis for assessing the effects of an altered hydrology on C dynamics. We conclude that climate change influences will be mediated primarily through the hydrologic cycle. A lower water table resulting from altered precipitation patterns and increased atmospheric temperature may be expected to decrease soil CH4 and increase CO2 emissions from the peat surface. Correspondingly, the C balance in forested peatlands is also sensitive to management and restoration prescriptions. Increases in soil CO2 efflux do not necessarily equate with net losses from the soil C pool. While the fundamentals of the C balance in peatlands are well-established, the combined affects of global change stressors and management practices are best considered using process-based biogeochemical models. Long-term studies are needed both for validation and to provide a framework for longitudinal assessments of the peatland C cycle.

ID GAS FLUXES; SOIL; EMISSIONS; PEATLANDS
AB Mass stabilization, a ground improvement solution used for construction in peatlands, involves mixing suitable dry binders into the peat, increasing strength and stiffness and reducing permeability. A previous pilot study of the carbonation process in stabilized peat showed that it could be a net sink of CO2, because the binder takes in CO2 from the atmosphere and any CO2 released by oxidized peat due to carbonation. In this study, a closed-chamber method was applied to stabilised peat specimens over a 6 month period to assess the factors affecting CO2 intake rate. The studies revealed that an increase in cement content and a larger surcharge contributed to a larger CO2 intake rate. These rates decreased logarithmically with time, and surcharge was found to be less influential over time. The CO2 intake rate reduced when the atmospheric CO2 concentration reduced, and the replacement of cement with ground granulated blast-furnace slag had a negative effect on the CO2 intake rate due to its lower carbonation potential. Furthermore, a high water table resulted in a decrease in the CO2 intake rate. These laboratory results have highlighted that dry soil mixing has a minimal on-site impact in environmental terms, allowing geotechnical engineers to make more informed decisions on the suitability of this technique for construction projects.

AB Although recent studies have recognized peatlands as a sink for atmospheric CO2, little is known about the role of Siberian peatlands in the global carbon cycle. We have estimated the Holocene peat and carbon accumulation rate in the peatlands of the southern taiga and subtaiga zones of western Siberia. We explain the accumulation rates by calculating the average peat accumulation rate and the long-term apparent rate of carbon accumulation (LORCA) and by using the model of Clymo (1984, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series B 303, 605-654). At three key areas in the southern taiga and subtaiga zones we studied eight sites, at which the dry bulk density, ash content, and carbon content were measured every 10 cm. Age was established by radiocarbon dating. The average peat accumulation rate at the eight sites varied from 0.35 +/- 0.03 to 1.13 +/- 0.02 mm yr(-1) and the LORCA values of bogs and fens varied from 19.0 +/- 1.1 to 69.0 +/- 4.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The accumulation rates had different trends especially during the early Holocene, caused by variations in vegetation succession resulting in differences in peat and carbon accumulation rates. The indirect effects of climate change through local hydrology appeared to be more important than direct influences of changes in precipitation and temperature. River valley fens were more drained during wetter periods as a result of deeper river incision, while bogs became wetter. From our dry bulk density results and our age-depth profiles we conclude that compaction is negligible and decay was not a relevant factor for undrained peatlands. These results contribute to our understanding of the influence of peatlands on the global carbon cycle and their potential impact on global change. (C) 2003 University of Washington.

AB Peatlands are lands with a peat layer at the surface, containing a large proportion of organic carbon. Such lands cover approximate to 1 000 000 km(2)in Europe, which is almost 10% of the total surface area. In many countries, peatlands have been artificially drained over centuries, leading to not only enormous emissions of CO(2)but also soil subsidence, mobilization of nutrients, higher flood risks, and loss of biodiversity. These problems can largely be solved by stopping drainage and rewetting the land. Wet peatlands do not release CO2, can potentially sequester carbon, help to improve water quality, provide habitat for rare and threatened biodiversity, and can still be used for production of biomass ("paludiculture"). Wisely adjusted land use on peatlands can substantially contribute to low-emission goals and further benefits for farmers, the economy, society, and the environment.

AB Although estimates of the annual methane (CH4) flux from agriculturally managed peatlands exist, knowledge of controls over the variation of CH4 at different time-scales is limited due to the lack of high temporal-resolution data. Here we present CH4 fluxes measured from May 2014 to April 2016 using the eddy covariance technique at an abandoned peatland pasture in western Newfoundland, Canada. The goals of the study were to identify the controls on the seasonal variations in CH4 flux and to quantify the annual CH4 flux. The seasonal variation in daily CH4 flux was not strong in the two study years, however a few periods of pronounced emissions occurred in the late growing season. The daily average CH4 flux was small relative to other studies, ranging from -4.1 to 9.9 nmol m(-2) s(-1) in 2014-15 and from -7.1 to 12.1 nmol m(-2) s(-1) in 2015-16. Stepwise multiple regression was used to investigate controls on CH4 flux and this analysis found shifting controls on CH4 flux at different periods of the growing season. During the early growing season CH4 flux was closely related to carbon dioxide fixation rates, suggesting substrate availability was the main control. The peak growing season CH4 flux was principally controlled by the CH4 oxidation in 2014, where the CH4 flux decreased and increased with soil temperature at 50 cm and soil water content at 10 cm, but a contrasting temperature-CH4 relation was found in 2015. The late growing season CH4 flux was found to be regulated by the variation in water table level and air temperature in 2014. The annual CH4 emission was near zero in both study years (0.36 +/- 0.30 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15 and 0.13 +/- 0.38 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015-16), but fell within the range of CH4 emissions reported for agriculturally managed peatlands elsewhere.

AB The increasing frequency of extreme drought and intense precipitation events with global warming may affect CH4 emissions from different types of wetlands by regulating drying-wetting cycles. To determine the effects of different water regimes on CH4 emissions, a mesocosm experiment was conducted. Soil cores sampled from peatland and gley marsh were subjected to two drying-wetting cycles (i.e., fluctuating between - 10 and 10 cm for 7 and 15 d, respectively) and three steady water table treatments (10, 0, and -10 cm). Alternation between drying and wetting stimulated CH4 emissions (F = 16.03 for 7 d and F = 31.85 for 15 d, P < 0.01). The highest emission pulses were observed between 4 and 9 d after the water table increased according to the models. Peak pulse emissions significantly increased by 41% in peatland and 109% in gley marsh after rewetting compared with that in the steady 0-cm water table treatment. Peatland soils had higher CH4 emissions than gley marsh soils under steady water table treatments (P < 0.01). This study shows that large pulses of CH4 can be emitted during short-duration drying-wetting episodes. If these pulses are not accounted for in budgets, CH4 emissions may be incorrectly assessed when comparing with field measurements during regularly spaced sampling intervals over only a few days or weeks by the static opaque chamber technique. Accurate estimates of CH4 budgets not only depend on increased measurement frequency but by necessity should incorporate weather events that cause rapid changes in the soil moisture regime.

AB Methane emission from wetlands is responsible for about 24% of the total CH4 emissions. The value of emission is a result of the balance between the processes of methane formation (methanogenesis) and sinks (methanotrophy). The methanotrophic activity from well-aerated soil surface layers has been relatively well recognized. On the contrary, the active role of plants in reduction of methane emission is rather not fully known. The association of methanotrophic bacteria with plants of Sphagnum spp., has already been recognized. In our investigations, particular attention was paid to vascular plants from a peatland overgrown by Sphagnum spp. but also Eriophorum vaginatum, Carex nigra, and Vaccinium oxycoccos. The gases emitted from the surface of Moszne peatland were collected using the chamber method from selected sites during growing seasons (spring, summer, autumn). To estimate the contribution of plants in methane emissions from the peatland, in each investigated site gas was sampled from the surface with the native flora cover and after removal thereof. Our results show that the reduction in the CH4 emission was related to the plant composition, vegetation period, and conditions of the plants. It was confirmed that the endophytes under investigation belonged to type I methanotrophs.

AB Ground penetrating radar (GPR) was used to determine peat basin geometry and the spatial distribution of free-phase biogenic gasses in two separate units of a northern peatland (Central and Southern Unit of Caribou Bog, Maine). The Central Unit is characterized by a deep basin structure (15 m maximum depth) and a raised (eccentric) bog topographic profile (up to 2 m topographic variation). Here numerous regions of electromagnetic (EM) wave scattering are considered diagnostic of the presence of extensive free-phase biogenic gas. In contrast, the Southern Unit is shallower (8 m maximum depth) and has a slightly convex upwards bog profile (less than 1 m topographic variation), and areas of EM wave scattering are notably absent. The biogenic gas zones interpreted from GPR in the Central Unit are associated with: (1) wooded heath vegetation at the surface, (2) open pools at the surface, (3) high water table elevations near the center of the basin, and (4) a region of overpressure (at approximately 5 m depth) immediately below the zone of free-phase gas accumulation. The latter suggests (1) a transient pressure head associated with low hydraulic conductivity resulting from the biogenic gasses themselves or confining layers in the peat that restrict both gas release and groundwater flow and/or (2) overpressure in the peat column as a result of the gas buildup itself. In contrast, the Southern Unit, where zones of EM scattering are absent, is characterized by: (1) predominantly shrub vegetation, (2) a lack of open pools, (3) only minor variations (less than 1 m) in water table elevation throughout the entire unit; and (4) generally upward groundwater flow throughout the basin. The results illustrate the nonuniformity of free-phase biogenic gas distribution at the peat basin scale and provide insights into the processes and controls associated with CH4 and CO2 accumulation in peatlands.

AB Rewetted extracted peatlands are sensitive ecosystems and they can act as greenhouse gas (GHG) sinks or sources due to changes in hydrology, vegetation, and weather conditions. However, studies on GHG emissions from extracted peatlands after rewetting are limited. Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission fluxes were determined using the opaque closed chamber method along water level gradients from littoral zones to the open water body of constructed shallow lakes with different vegetation zones in a nutrient-rich rewetted extracted peatland in Sweden. Vegetation communities and their position relative to water level, together with short-term water level fluctuations, such as inundation events and seasonal droughts, and temperature had a significant impact on CH4 emissions fluxes. During "normal" and "dry" conditions and high soil temperatures, CH4 emissions were highest from Carex spp.-Typha latifolia L. communities. During inundation events with water levels > 30 cm, sites with flooded Graminoids-Scirpus spp.-Carex spp. emitted most CH4. Methane emissions from the water body of the constructed shallow lakes were low during all water level conditions and over the temperature ranges observed. Nitrous oxide emissions contributed little to the emission fluxes from the soil-plant-water systems to the atmosphere, and they were only detectable from the sites with Graminoids. In terms of management, the construction of shallow lakes showed great potential for lowering GHG emission fluxes from nutrient rich peatlands after peat extraction, even though the vegetated shore emitted some N2O and CH4.

AB Most previous studies on methane (CH4) emissions from peatlands have focused on the boreal, subarctic, and tropical regions. Little is known about CH4 emissions from the alpine peatlands that are widely distributed in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), which are sensitive to climate change and human disturbance. To assess the magnitudes of daily and seasonal variations in CH4 flux in this area, and to identify the influential environmental factors, an eddy covariance (EC) tower with a LI-7700 open-path CH4 analyzer was established on Hongyuan Peatland. Total annual CH4 emission was 46.8 g CH(4)m(-2) in 2014, with emissions in the non-growing season accounting for 25% of the annual total. From May to September 2014, diurnal variation in CH4 emissions was observed, with CH4 fluxes varying between 0.15 and 0.25 mu molm(-2) s(-1). In contrast, during all other periods of 2014, no diurnal variation was observed, and CH4 flux varied below 0.05 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). A clear seasonal pattern in CH4 exchange with small surges in CH4 emission appeared in soil thawing and freezing seasons. Wavelet analysis was applied to the continuous CH4 flux time series to explore temporal variation in ecosystem CH4 exchange during the growing season. On daily timescales, changes in CH4 flux are in phase with changes in air temperature, and influenced by friction velocity and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). On weekly-to-monthly timescales, soil temperature can explain most of the variation in CH4 exchange. Though CH4 fluxes had no apparent correlation with water table level, fluxes were significantly (R-2 = 0.86) correlated with soil temperature measured at -25 cm depth, close to the water table level throughout the growing season, suggesting a synergistic effect of water table level and soil temperature on methane emission. This study highlights the need for continuous eddy covariance measurements and time series analysis approaches to adequately describe temporal variability in ecosystem CH4 exchange.

AB Boreal peatlands are an important natural source of atmospheric methane (CH4). Recently, boreal peatlands have been experiencing increased nitrogen (N) availability and decreased moss production. However, little is known about the interactive effect of moss and N availability on CH4 emissions in boreal peatlands. In this study, the effects of moss removal and N addition (6 gNm (-2) yr(-1)) on CH4 emissions were examined during the growing seasons of 2011, 2012 and 2013 in a boreal peatland in the Great Hinggan Mountain of northeast China. Notably, the response of CH4 emissions to moss removal and N addition varied with experimental duration. Moss removal and N addition did not affect CH4 emissions in 2011 and 2012, but respectively reduced CH4 emissions by 50% and 66% in 2013. However, moss removal and N addition did not produce an interactive effect on CH4 emissions. Consequently, moss removal plus N addition had no effect on CH4 emissions in 2011 and 2012, but decreased CH4 emissions by 68% in 2013. These results suggest that the effects of moss removal and N enrichment on CH4 emissions are time-dependent in boreal peatlands, and also imply that increased N availability and decreased moss growth would independently inhibit CH4 emissions in the boreal peatlands of northeast China.

AB Drained and cultivated fen peats represent some of the world's most productive soils, however, they are susceptible to degradation and typically exhibit high rates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. We hypothesised that GHG losses from these soils could be reduced by manipulating water table depth, tillage regime, crop residue application or horticultural fleece cover. Using intact soil columns from a horticultural peatland, emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4 were monitored over a six-month period, using a closed-chamber method. Concurrent measurements of soil properties allowed identification of the key controls on GHG emissions. Raising the water table to the soil surface provided the strongest reduction in global warming potential (GWP(100); 25 +/- 6 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), compared to a free-draining control (80 +/- 1 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), but this effect was partially negated by an emission pulse when the water table was subsequently lowered. The highest emissions occurred when the water table was maintained 15 cm below the surface (168 +/- 11 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), as this stimulated N2O loss. Placement of horticultural fleece over the soil surface during spring had no significant effect on GWP100, but prolonged fleece application exacerbated GHG emissions. Leaving lettuce crop residues on the surface increased soil GWP(100) (105 +/- 4 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)) in comparison to when residues were incorporated into the soil (85 +/- 4 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), however, there was no evidence that this promoted positive priming of native soil organic matter (SOM). For maximum abatement potential, mitigation measures should be applied during the growing season, when GHG emissions are greatest. Our results also suggest that introduction of zero or minimum-till practices may not reduce GHG emissions. Maintaining a high water table was the only option that reliably reduced GHG emissions, however, this option is impractical to implement within current horticultural systems. We conclude that alternative strategies or a major change in land use (e.g., conversion from horticulture/arable to wetland) should be explored as a means of preserving these soils for future generations.

AB The response of methanogens to thawing permafrost is an important factor for the global greenhouse gas budget. We tracked methanogenic community structure, activity, and abundance along the degradation of sub-Arctic palsa peatland permafrost. We observed the development of pronounced methane production, release, and abundance of functional (mcrA) methanogenic gene numbers following the transitions from permafrost (palsa) to thaw pond structures. This was associated with the establishment of a methanogenic community consisting both of hydrogenotrophic (Methanobacterium, Methanocellales), and potential acetoclastic (Methanosarcina) members and their activity. While peat bog development was not reflected in significant changes of mcrA copy numbers, potential methane production, and rates of methane release decreased. This was primarily linked to a decline of potential acetoclastic in favor of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Although palsa peatland succession offers similarities with typical transitions from fen to bog ecosystems, the observed dynamics in methane fluxes and methanogenic communities are primarily attributed to changes within the dominant Bryophyte and Cyperaceae taxa rather than to changes in peat moss and sedge coverage, pH and nutrient regime. Overall, the palsa peatland methanogenic community was characterized by a few dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs). These OTUs seem to be indicative for methanogenic species that thrive in terrestrial organic rich environments. In summary, our study shows that after an initial stage of high methane emissions following permafrost thaw, methane fluxes, and methanogenic communities establish that are typical for northern peat bogs.

AB Following a summer drought, intact cores of peat soil from two cool temperate peatlands (a rain-fed bog and a groundwater-fed swamp) were exposed experimentally to three different water table levels. The goal was to examine recovery of anaerobic methanogenesis and to evaluate peat soil decomposition to methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) upon rewetting. Methane emission from soils to the atmosphere was greatest (mean = 80 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) when the entire peat core was rewetted quickly; emission was negligible at low water level and when peat cores were rewetted gradually. Rates of CO2 emission (mean = 1.0 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) were relatively insensitive to water level. Concentrations of CH4 in soil air spaces suggest that onset of methanogenesis induces, but later represses, aerobic oxidation of CH4 above the water table. Concentrations of CO2 suggest production at the soil surface of swamp peat versus at greater depths in bog peat. Portions of peat soil incubated in vitro without oxygen (O-2) exhibited a lag before the onset of methanogenesis, and the lag time was less in peat from the cores rewetted quickly. The inhibition of methanogenesis by the selective inhibitor 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (BES) decreased CO2 production by 20 to 30% but resulted in an increase in concentrations of DOC by 2 to 5 times. The results show that methanogens in peat soils tolerate moderate drought, and recovery varies among different peat types. In peat soils, the inhibition of methanogenesis might enhance DOC availability.

AB Northern peatlands are projected to be crucial in future atmospheric methane (CH4) budgets and have a positive feedback on global warming. Fens receive nutrients from catchments via inflowing water and are more sensitive than bogs to variations in their ecohydrology. Yet, due to a lack of data detailing the impacts of moving water on microhabitats and CH4 fluxes in fens, large uncertainties remain with respect to predicting CH4 emissions from these sites under climate changes. We measured CH4 fluxes with manual chambers over three growing seasons (2017-2019) at a northern boreal fen. To address the spatial variation at the site where a stream flows through the long and narrow valley fen, we established sample plots at varying distances from the stream. To link the variations in CH4 emissions to environmental controls, we quantified water levels, peat temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, vegetation composition, and leaf area index in combination with flux measurements during the growing season in 2019. We found that due to the flowing water, there was a higher water level, cooler peat temperatures, and more oxygen in the peat close to the stream, which also had the highest total leaf area and gross primary production (GPP) values but the lowest CH4 emissions. CH4 emissions were highest at an intermediate distance from the stream where the oxygen concentration in the surface peat was low but GPP was still high. Further from the stream, the conditions were drier and produced low CH4 emissions. Our results emphasize the key role of ecohydrology in CH4 dynamics in fens and, for the first time, show how a stream controls CH4 emissions in a flow-through fen. As valley fens are common peatland ecosystems from the Arctic to the temperate zones, future projections of global CH4 budgets need to take flowing water features into account.

AB Methane (CH4) emissions from northern peatlands are projected to increase due to climate change, primarily because of projected increases in soil temperature. Yet, the rates and temperature responses of the two CH4 emission-related microbial processes (CH4 production by methanogens and oxidation by methanotrophs) are poorly known. Further, peatland sites within a fen-bog gradient are known to differ in the variables that regulate these two mechanisms, yet the interaction between peatland type and temperature lacks quantitative understanding. Here, we investigated potential CH4 production and oxidation rates for 14 peatlands in Finland located between c. 60 and 70 degrees N latitude, representing bogs, poor fens, and rich fens. Potentials were measured at three different temperatures (5, 17.5, and 30celcius) using the laboratory incubation method. We linked CH4 production and oxidation patterns to their methanogen and methanotroph abundance, peat properties, and plant functional types. We found that the rich fen-bog gradient-related nutrient availability and methanogen abundance increased the temperature response of CH4 production, with rich fens exhibiting the greatest production potentials. Oxidation potential showed a steeper temperature response than production, which was explained by aerenchymous plant cover, peat water holding capacity, peat nitrogen, and sulfate content. The steeper temperature response of oxidation suggests that, at higher temperatures, CH4 oxidation might balance increased CH4 production. Predicting net CH4 fluxes as an outcome of the two mechanisms is complicated due to their different controls and temperature responses. The lack of correlation between field CH4 fluxes and production/oxidation potentials, and the positive correlation with aerenchymous plants points toward the essential role of CH4 transport for emissions. The scenario of drying peatlands under climate change, which is likely to promote Sphagnum establishment over brown mosses in many places, will potentially reduce the predicted warming-related increase in CH4 emissions by shifting rich fens to Sphagnum-dominated systems.

AB Many wetland ecosystems such as peatlands and wet tundra hold large amounts of organic carbon (C) in their soils, and are thus important in the terrestrial C cycle. We have synthesized data on the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange obtained from eddy covariance measurements from 12 wetland sites, covering 1-7 years at each site, across Europe and North America, ranging from ombrotrophic and minerotrophic peatlands to wet tundra ecosystems, spanning temperate to arctic climate zones. The average summertime net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was highly variable between sites. However, all sites with complete annual datasets, seven in total, acted as annual net sinks for atmospheric CO2. To evaluate the influence of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) on NEE, we first removed the artificial correlation emanating from the method of partitioning NEE into GPP and R-eco. After this correction neither R-eco (P = 0.162) nor GPP (P = 0.110) correlated significantly with NEE on an annual basis. Spatial variation in annual and summertime R-eco was associated with growing season period, air temperature, growing degree days, normalized difference vegetation index and vapour pressure deficit. GPP showed weaker correlations with environmental variables as compared with R-eco, the exception being leaf area index (LAI), which correlated with both GPP and NEE, but not with R-eco. Length of growing season period was found to be the most important variable describing the spatial variation in summertime GPP and R-eco; global warming will thus cause these components to increase. Annual GPP and NEE correlated significantly with LAI and pH, thus, in order to predict wetland C exchange, differences in ecosystem structure such as leaf area and biomass as well as nutritional status must be taken into account.

AB In Central Europe, most bogs have a history of drainage and many of them are currently being restored. Success of restoration as well as greenhouse gas exchange of these bogs is influenced by environmental stress factors as drought and atmospheric nitrogen deposition. We determined the methane and nitrous oxide exchange of sites in the strongly decomposed center and less decomposed edge of the Pietzmoor bog in NW Germany in 2004. Also, we examined the methane and nitrous oxide exchange of mesocosms from the center and edge before, during, and following a drainage experiment as well as carbon dioxide release from disturbed unfertilized and nitrogen fertilized surface peat. In the field, methane fluxes ranged from 0 to 3.8 mg m(-2) h(-1) and were highest from hollows. Field nitrous oxide fluxes ranged from 0 to 574 mu gm(-2) h(-1) and were elevated at the edge. A large Eriophorum vaginatum tussock showed decreasing nitrous oxide release as the season progressed. Drainage of mesocosms decreased methane release to 0, even during rewetting. There was a tendency for a decrease of nitrous oxide release during drainage and for an increase in nitrous oxide release during rewetting. Nitrogen fertilization did not increase decomposition of surface peat. Our examinations suggest a competition between vascular vegetation and denitrifiers for excess nitrogen. We also provide evidence that the von Post humification index can be used to explain nitrous oxide release from bogs, if the role of vascular vegetation is also considered. An assessment of the greenhouse gas release from nitrogen saturated restoring bogs needs to take into account elevated release from fresh Sphagnum peat as well as from sedges growing on decomposed peat. Given the high atmospheric nitrogen deposition, restoration will not be able to achieve an oligotrophic ecosystem in the short term.

AB Plants are known to influence peatland carbon fluxes both i) directly through respiration and ii) by the production of litter and root exudates, which are then broken down by microbes within the peat matrix. In this study we investigated whether three different plant species typical of a UK blanket bog complex - Calluna vulgaris, Juncus effusus and mixed Sphagnum species - influence the carbon sequestering abilities of the peat that they grow in. To quantify this we measured fluxes of soil derived CO2 and CH4, and extractable levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and phenolics, from peat samples taken from areas dominated by one of the three plant communities. It was found that there were significant differences between the carbon fluxes from the different sites, which we attributed to changes brought about by the vegetation on the pH, phenolic concentrations and extracellular enzyme activities found in the peat matrix. Peat taken from Sphagnum-dominated areas emitted less CO2 than the other two sample groups, and had lower overall DOC concentrations and phenol oxidase activities. Conversely, Juncus-peat had the highest CO2 and CH4 fluxes, along with the greatest phenol oxidase activities. Taking all the results into consideration the plants were ranked in order of their ability to reduce the loss of carbon from the peat soil within which they were growing: Sphagnum>Calluna>Juncus. These results suggest that plant community structures could be altered in order to maximise a peatland's ability to be used as a carbon store should they need to be managed as part of a carbon stewardship scheme or a geoengineering project - if this was to be the sole management interest in an area of peatland.

AB Retired farmland restoration is increasingly seen as a valuable opportunity to improve ecosystem functions in sensitive regions. For example, with expected mass retirement of cranberry farms in New England, there is increasing interest in restoring retired cranberry farms back to wetlands. To understand how restoration of retired cranberry farms to wetland ecosystems influences climate-related ecosystem functions, we assessed methane and carbon dioxide emissions from different post-farming management options, including an actively farmed cranberry bog, young and old retired cranberry bogs, young and old restored cranberry bogs, and a natural reference bog. In addition to methane and carbon dioxide, we measured key soil properties influential in greenhouse gas flux, including soil organic matter, moisture, pH, redox potential, and bulk density. Greenhouse gas flux differed significantly by site type, with the restored systems functioning similarly to the natural reference wetland while retired sites had fluxes similar to the actively farmed site. The older restored site had significantly lower emissions of both methane and carbon dioxide than the newly restored site, indicating that over a larger time scale, restored systems may transition from net carbon dioxide sources to sinks. Overall, the results of this study suggest that in addition to the many other ecological benefits, the restoration of wetlands may also play a role in climate change mitigation through their ability to store carbon.

AB Methane fluxes measured in a eutrophic peat meadow in The Netherlands dominated by vascular plants showed high spatial and temporal variability. To elucidate this variability as well as the underlying processes, various measurement techniques were used: soil gradients of methane concentrations, the chamber method, and the eddy covariance technique. Additionally, soil temperature at multiple depths, soil water level, root depth, carbon dioxide fluxes, incoming radiation, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, friction velocity latent, heat fluxes, and living biomass were monitored.
   A comparison of the measurement techniques showed that: (a) the soil gradient method and the chamber method showed comparable methane fluxes only at a site with low water table and shallow roots, while at other sites methane fluxes were underestimated with the soil gradient method by an order of magnitude: (b) a footprint analysis showed that the chamber method and eddy covariance showed similar methane fluxes for the different land elements (dry land, wet land, and ditches plus borders). However, when up-scaling the chamber measurements over time using a regression model based on soil temperature, methane emissions were overestimated by 37% compared to the eddy covariance data. The chamber method was the best technique to assess spatial variability, while eddy covariance was best for assessing temporal variability as well as up-scaling. The soil gradient method for methane fluxes should be used with great care, and probably generates reliable results only in areas with low water table and shallow roots.
   Both the chamber method and eddy covariance showed significant spatial variability, which was best explained by soil water level in combination with root depth patterns. Together, these variables probably determined the net methane production and the available mechanisms for methane transport to atmosphere. The methane fluxes showed strong temporal variability at different scales: diurnal cycles, significant day-to-day variability, and seasonal variations. Clear diurnal cycles of methane fluxes were observed synchronous to incoming radiation, latent heat and net ecosystem exchange, but not synchronous to temperature. This suggested that stomatal opening and/or pressurized convective throughflow were important mechanisms for gas transport through plants. The variability at the day-today scale was best explained by soil temperature below the water level combined with soil water level. Highest methane fluxes were observed during summer and lowest fluxes during autumn and winter. The vegetation density together with temperature and length of day-light probably determined this seasonality. Also, temporal variability varied spatially, probably due to the water table and root depth. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands are a major terrestrial carbon store and a persistent natural carbon sink during the Holocene, but there is considerable uncertainty over the fate of peatland carbon in a changing climate. It is generally assumed that higher temperatures will increase peat decay, causing a positive feedback to climate warming and contributing to the global positive carbon cycle feedback. Here we use a new extensive database of peat profiles across northern high latitudes to examine spatial and temporal patterns of carbon accumulation over the past millennium. Opposite to expectations, our results indicate a small negative carbon cycle feedback from past changes in the long-term accumulation rates of northern peatlands. Total carbon accumulated over the last 1000 yr is linearly related to contemporary growing season length and photosynthetically active radiation, suggesting that variability in net primary productivity is more important than decomposition in determining long-term carbon accumulation. Furthermore, northern peatland carbon sequestration rate declined over the climate transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to the Little Ice Age (LIA), probably because of lower LIA temperatures combined with increased cloudiness suppressing net primary productivity. Other factors including changing moisture status, peatland distribution, fire, nitrogen deposition, permafrost thaw and methane emissions will also influence future peatland carbon cycle feedbacks, but our data suggest that the carbon sequestration rate could increase over many areas of northern peatlands in a warmer future.

AB A novel way of estimating the gas bubble volume in the floating mat sediment of a peatland was developed at Thoreau's Bog in Concord, Massachusetts. Statistically significant relationships between the buoyancy of the floating Sphagnum mat and atmospheric pressure were observed, and these relationships were used to estimate the gas bubble volume. The mass of CH4 stored in gas bubbles is estimated to be as much as 3 times the mass of dissolved CH4, depending on the time of year. The gas bubble volume is frequently large enough to serve as a significant buffer between microbial production of CH4 and the release of CH4 to the atmosphere. Changes in atmospheric pressure, temperature, and water-table elevation may result in modulation of the ebullitive CH4 flux. Periods of rapidly using atmospheric pressure or equivalent pressure changes due to water-table elevation are capable of arresting bubble volume growth, thereby halting CH4 ebullition. Periods of rapid cooling of the bog could also temporarily halt ebullition, as thermally induced contraction of bubbles and dissolution of CH4 offset bubble volume growth due to methanogenesis.

AB Vertical profiles of oxygen uptake potential were measured in peat. When both O-2 and CH4 were in excess, methanotrophy accounted for 85% of the O-2 uptake potential, showing a high capacity for CH4 oxidation in the peat. In the absence of CH4, maximum O-2 uptake potential was near the peat surface where available labile organic matter was present and decreased with depth as organic matter became more refractory. The oxidation of CH4 followed saturation kinetics with respect to both CH4 and O-2 when they were at limiting concentrations. For CH4 oxidation in the peat, the k(O2) was 32 mu M O-2 and k(CH4) was 57.9 mu M CH4. The V-max for O-2 was 209 nmol O-2 ml(-1) peat h(-1), which was approximately double that for CH4, correctly reflecting the stoichiometry of aerobic CH4 oxidation. The CH4 oxidation kinetics were used in a mathematical model to examine the effect of plant roots on increasing the vertical transport rate of CH4 out of and O-2 into the peat, by gas phase transport through the roots. In the absence of roots, CH4 oxidation was confined to a narrow layer near the peat surface where vertical gradients of O-2 and CH4 overlapped. Little CH4 diffused through this surface layer. With roots present, the model confirmed the possibility of sub-surface peaks of aerobic CH4 oxidation potential below the water table in an apparently anoxic peat. These were due to active CH4 oxidation in the oxic rhizosphere maintained by the plant roots in the otherwise anoxic peat. The extrusion of O-2 from the root tips also tended to diminish in situ CH4 formation by inhibition of the anaerobic methanogenic bacteria. The presence of plant roots increased the Aux of CH4 out of the pear to the atmosphere, by-passing the surface oxic layer in which active CH4 oxidation mopped up vertically diffusing CH4.

AB Methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) are the only biological sinks for methane (CH4). Drainage of peatlands is known to decrease overall CH4 emission, but the effect on MOB is unknown. The objective of this work was to characterize the MOB community and activity in two ecohydrologically different pristine peatland ecosystems, a fen and a bog, and their counterparts that were drained in 1961. Oligotrophic fens are groundwater-fed peatlands, but ombrotrophic bogs receive additional water and nutrients only from rainwater. The sites were sampled in August 2003 down to 10 cm below the water table (WT), and cores were divided into 10-cm subsamples. CH4 oxidation was measured by gas chromatography (GC) to characterize MOB activity. The MOB community structure was characterized by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing methods using partial pmoA and mmoX genes. The highest CH4 oxidation rates were measured from the subsamples 20-30 and 30-40 cm above WT at the pristine oligotrophic fen (12.7 and 10.5 mu mol CH4 dm(-3) h(-1), respectively), but the rates decreased to almost zero in the vicinity of WT. In the pristine ombrotrophic bog, the highest oxidation rate at 0-10 cm was lower than in the fen (8.10 mu mol CH4 dm(-3) h(-1)), but in contrast to the fen, oxidation rates of 4.5 mu mol CH4 dm(-3) h(-1) were observed at WT and 10 cm below WT. Drainage reduced the CH4 oxidation rates to maximum values of 1.67 and 5.77 mu mol CH4 dm(-3) h(-1) at 30-40 and 20-30 cm of the fen and bog site, respectively. From the total of 13 pmoA-derived DGGE bands found in the study, 11, 3, 6, and 2 were observed in the pristine fen and bog and their drained counterparts, respectively. According to the nonmetric multidimensional scaling of the DGGE banding pattern, the MOB community of the pristine fen differed from the other sites. The majority of partial pmoA sequences belonged to type I MOB, whereas the partial mmoX bands that were observed only in the bog sites formed a distinct group relating more to type II MOB. This study indicates that fen and bog ecosystems differ in MOB activity and community structure, and both these factors are affected by drainage.

AB The Zoige alpine peatlands cover approximately 4,605 km(2) of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and are considered to constitute the largest plateau peatland on the Eurasian continent. However, the Zoige alpine peatlands are undergoing major degradation because of human activities and climate change, which would cause uncertainty in the budget of greenhouse gases (CH4 and CO2) and carbon (C) storage in global peatlands. This study simultaneously investigates the CH4 and CO2 emission fluxes and C storage at three typical sites with respect to the peatland degradation gradient: peatland, wet meadow and dry meadow. Results show that peatland degradation would increase the CO2 emission and decrease the CH4 emission. Moreover, the average C emission fluxes were 66.05, 165.78 and 326.56 mg C m(-2) hr(-1) for the peatland, wet meadow and dry meadow, respectively. The C storage of the vegetation does not considerably differ among the three sampling sites. However, when compared with the peatland (1,088.17 t C ha(-1)), the soil organic C storage decreases by 420 and 570 t C ha(-1) in case of wet and dry meadows, respectively. Although the C storage in the degraded peatlands decreases considerably, it can still represent a large capacity of C sink. Therefore, the degraded peatlands in the Zoige alpine area must be protected and restored to mitigate regional climate change.

AB Ecosystem respiration (ER) is an important but poorly understood part of the carbon (C) budget of peatlands and is controlled primarily by the thermal and hydrologic regimes. To establish the relative importance of these two controls for a large ombrotrophic bog near Ottawa, Canada, we analyzed ER from measurements of nighttime net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) determined by eddy covariance technique. Measurements were made from May to October over five years, 1998 to 2002. Ecosystem respiration ranged from less than 1 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in spring (May) and fall (late October) to 2-4 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) during mid-summer (July-August). As anticipated, there was a strong relationship between ER and peat temperatures (r(2) = 0.62). Q(10) between 5 degrees to 15 degrees C varied from 2.2 to 4.2 depending upon the choice of depth where temperature was measured and location within a hummock or hollow. There was only a weak relationship between ER and water-table depth (r(2) = 0.11). A laboratory incubation of peat cores at different moisture contents showed that CO2 production was reduced by drying in the surface samples, but there was little decrease in production due to drying from below a depth of 30 cm. We postulate that the weak correlation between ER and water table position in this peatland is primarily a function of the bog being relatively dry, with water table varying between 30 and 75 cm below the hummock tops. The dryness gives rise to a complex ER response to water table involving i) compensations between production of CO2 in the upper and lower peat profile as the water table falls and ii) the importance of autotrophic respiration, which is relatively independent of water-table position.

AB Changes in hydrological conditions are expected and may alter carbon cycling in peatlands. Peat aeration with water table change has not commonly been investigated, and the water table is often assumed to constitute the oxic-anoxic boundary in peat. We analyzed temperature, moisture, oxygen (O-2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in profiles of a temperate fen during two seasons. A drying-rewetting cycle and flooding were induced and compared to controls. The response of moisture and water table position varied greatly and was related to gradients of peat compaction and ash content. Background drought raised air-filled porosity (AFP) to a maximum of 15%-38% in shallow peat and experimental drought up to 50%. Decline in water table and soil moisture broadly led to O-2 penetration and CO2 degassing, and rewetting and flooding led to anoxic conditions and CO2 accumulation in peat pore water. In dense peat with >= 20% ash content the unsaturated zone remained partly low in oxygen, however, and up to 5% AFP and 20 cm above water table O-2 concentrations frequently remained below 50 mu mol L-1. Moderately intense and short drying did not induce substantial oxygen penetration in the compacted soil profiles. The likelihood of the presence of oxygen in the peat was predicted by logistic regression using water table and ash content or bulk density as predictors (p < 0.0005). The model is potentially useful for predicting the position of the redoxcline in peat deposits and may assist in improving statistical models of trace gas emission from peatlands.

AB Northern peatlands cover approximately 4% of the global land surface area. Those peatlands will be particularly vulnerable to environmental and climate change and therefore it is important to investigate their total greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets, to determine the feedback on the climate. Nitrogen (N) is known to influence the GHG budget in particular by affecting the methane (CH4) balance. At two peatland sites in Scotland and Finland GHG fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitrogen fluxes were measured as part of the European project 'NitroEurope'. The Scottish site, Auchencorth Moss, was a GHG sink of -321, -490 and -321 g CO2 eq m(-2) year(-1) in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, with CO2 as the dominating GHG. In contrast, the dominating GHG at the Finnish site, Lompolojankka, was CH4, resulting in the site being a net GHG source of +485 and +431 g CO2 eq m(-2) year(-1) in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Therefore. Auchencorth Moss had a negative global warming potential (GWP) whilst Lompolojankka had a positive GWP over the investigated time period. Initial results yielded a positive N budget for Lompolojankka of 7.1 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), meaning the site was gaining nitrogen, and a negative N budget for Auchencorth Moss of -2.4 kg N ha year(-1), meaning the site was losing nitrogen.

TI Climate change reduces the capacity of northern peatlands to absorb the

AB The carbon (C) storage of northern peatlands is equivalent to similar to 34-46% of the similar to 795Tg C currently held in the atmosphere as CO2. Most studies report that northern peatlands are a sink of between 20 and 60g CO2-C m(-2)yr(-1). Since peatland hydrology and biogeochemistry are very closely related to climate, there is concern whether northern peatlands will continue to function as C sinks with climate change. We used a coupled land surface scheme and peatland C model, called CLASS3W-MWM, to examine the sensitivity of peatland C to climate change. Based on the data available to constrain our model, we simulated the C dynamics of the Mer Bleue (MB) bog in eastern Canada and the Degero Stormyr (DS) poor fen in northern Sweden for four Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change scenarios, i.e., A1B, A2, B1, and Commit, over four time periods, i.e., present day, 2030, 2060, and 2100. When the simulated future C fluxes were compared to the baseline fluxes under the present climate conditions, we found that fens were much more sensitive to climate change than bogs. Gross primary production (GPP) at MB significantly increased by 4-44% up to 2100 for all scenarios except Commit. GPP at DS significantly decreased by 34-39% for A1B and A2, and slightly increased by 6-10% for B1 and Commit. Total ecosystem respiration (TER) significantly increased by 7-57% for MB and 4-34% for DS up to 2100 for all scenarios except Commit. Net ecosystem production (NEP), therefore, significantly decreased. The bog, however, was still a C sink up to 2100, though much reduced, but the fen switched to a C source for A1B and A2 scenarios. Additional experiments where we climatically transplanted the study peatlands or forced vegetation changes when the fen became too dry showed similar but less dramatic results as the standard runs. Our results indicate that northern peatlands should be included in the C-coupled climate model to fully understand the response of C cycling in terrestrial ecosystems to climate change and to reduce the uncertainties for projecting the future climate.

AB Peatlands are generally small sinks for atmospheric CO2. However, the sustainability of this sink functioning is threatened in a changing climate. We measured the M exchange in a temperate bog between August 2005 and July 2006 using the eddy covariance technique. During this period, the CO2 balance was -78.6 +/- 20.0 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1), which is a lower uptake than others have reported for comparable ecosystems, but in accordance with average Holocene uptake rates. Average winter emissions were small (11 mu g CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). but the accumulated non-growing season fluxes (121 g CO2 m(-2)) represent a larger flux than the annual balance. Taking into consideration that wintertime temperatures in the northern hemisphere are expected to increase in the future, wintertime fluxes may become increasingly important. The highest instantaneous monthly average uptake occurred in June (-38 mu g CO2 m(-2) S-1), while the drier month of July showed a distinctly smaller sink (-22 mu g CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). It is suggested that soil drying caused gross primary production to decline. while nighttime respiration showed a steadily increase. Our findings indicate that the effect of future warmer temperatures on the growing season CO) exchange in peatlands is dependent on soil wetness.

AB Peatlands cover only about 3% of the Earth's surface and store 15-30% of the Global soil carbon as a peat. However, human intervention and climate change threatens the stability of peatlands, owing to deforest, wildfire, mining, drainage, glacial retreat, and permafrost. In our study, we modified the SWAT model to couple snow, soil temperature and carbon dioxide emission. Then the modified SWAT was used for predicting snow depth, soil temperature at different depths and carbon dioxide emission from peatlands and other land uses at Athabasca river basin, Canada. The results of the study indicated that SWAT model estimated the daily snow depth with R-2, NSE, RMSE and PBIAS values of 0.83, 0.76, 0.52 and - 2.3 in the calibration period (2006-2007) and 0.79, 0.71, 0.97 and -3.6 for the validation period (2008-2009), respectively. The SWAT model also predicted soil temperature very well at three depths (5 cm, 10 cm and 30 cm). The simulation model results also confirmed that the modified SWAT model estimates the CO2 emission at Athabasca river basin with good model fit during calibration (R-2 = 0.71, NSE = 0.67, RMSE = 2.6 and PBIAS = 3.2) and during validation (R-2 = 0.63, NSE = 0.58, RMSE = 3.1 and PBIAS = 9.3). Overall, our result confirmed that SWAT model performed well in representing the dynamics of snow depth, soil temperature and CO2 emissions in the peatlands at the Athabasca river basin.

AB We examine the potential of bioenergy crops to offset greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, assuming homogeneous agricultural land and distance-dependent transport costs. Variable transport costs define the socially and privately optimal extensive margin of the bioenergy crop production and imply that fertiliser intensity differs across locations. Under current policy, private fertiliser application is suboptimal, requiring location-specific input, transport or output subsidies. The theoretical model is applied to reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) in Finland, which offsets emissions from peat in electricity production. If oats is the alternative crop, and taking permit price of CO2 emissions as the proxy for climate benefits over the life cycle, reed canary grass production is socially optimal even 100 km away from the power plant and still offsets more than 6 tons/ha of CO2 emissions from peat.

AB Northern wetlands with organic soil i.e., mires are significant carbon storages. This key ecosystem service may be threatened by anthropogenic activities and climate change, yet we still lack a consensus on how these major changes affects their carbon sink capacities. We studied how forestry drainage and restoration combined with experimental warming, impacts greenhouse gas fluxes of wetlands with peat. We measured CO2 and CH4 during two and N2O fluxes during one growing season using the chamber method.
   Gas fluxes were primarily controlled by water table, leaf area and temperature. Land use had a clear impact of on CO2 exchange. Forestry drainage increased respiration rates and decreased field layer net ecosystem CO2 uptake (NEE) and leaf area index (LAI), while at restoration sites the flux rates and LAI had recovered to the level of undrained sites. CH4 emissions were exceptionally low at all sites during our study years due to natural drought, but still somewhat lower at drained compared to undrained sites. Moderate warming triggered an increase in LAI across all land use types. This was accompanied by an increase in cumulative seasonal NEE. Restoration appeared to be an effective tool to return the ecosystem functions of these wetlands as we found no differences in LAI or any gas flux components (PMAX, Reco, NEE, CH4 or N2O) between restored and undrained sites. We did not find any signs that moderate warming would compromise the return of the ecosystem functions related to C sequestration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Thermokarst lakes result from the thawing of ice-rich permafrost and are widespread across northern landscapes. These waters are strong emitters of methane, especially in permafrost peatland regions, where they are stained black by high concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM). In the present study, we aimed to structurally characterize the DOM from a set of peatland thermokarst lakes that are known to be intense sites of microbial decomposition and methane emission. Samples were collected at different depths from three thermokarst lakes in the Sasapimakwananisikw (SAS) River valley near the eastern Hudson Bay community of Kuujjuarapik-Whapmagoostui (Nunavik, Canada). Samples were analyzed by spectrofluorometry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and elemental analysis. Fluorescence analyses indicated considerable amounts of autochthonous DOM in the surface waters of one of SAS 1A, indicating a strong bioavailability of labile DOM, and consequently a greater methanogenic potential. The three lakes differed in their chemical composition and diversity, suggesting various DOM transformations phenomena. The usefulness of complementary analytical approaches to characterize the complex mixture of DOM in permafrost peatland waters cannot be overlooked, representing a first step towards greater comprehension of the organic geochemical properties of these permafrost-derived systems.

AB Intensive cultivation of fen peat soils (Eutric Histosols) for agricultural purposes, started in Europe about 250 years ago, resulting in decreased soil fertility, increased oxidation of peat and corresponding CO2-emissions to the atmosphere, nutrient transfer to aquatic ecosystems and losses in the total area of the former native wetlands. To prevent these negative environmental effects set-aside programs and rewetting measures were promoted in recent years. Literature results and practical experiences showed that large scale rewetting of intensively used agricultural Histosols may result in the mobilisation of phosphorus (P), its transport to adjacent surface waters and an accelerated eutrophication risk. The paper summarises results from an international European Community sponsored research project and demonstrates how results obtained at different scales and from different scientific disciplines were compiled to derive a strategy to carry out rewetting measures. A decision support system (DSS) for a hydrologically sensitive area in the Droemling catchment in north-eastern Germany was developed and is presented as a tool to regulate rewetting in order to control P release. It is demonstrated that additional laboratory experiments to identify essential processes of P release during rewetting and the site-specific management of the water table, the involvement of specific knowledge and experience of the stakeholders are necessary to develop an applicable DSS. The presented DSS is practically used to prevent freshwater resources from diffuse P pollution.

AB Grasslands established on drained peat soils are regarded as negligible methane (CH4) sources; however, they can still exhibit considerable soil CH4 dynamics. We investigated archaeal community composition in two different fen peat soils and one bog peat soil under permanent grassland in Denmark. We used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) fingerprinting and clone libraries to characterize the soils' archaeal community composition to gain a better understanding of relationships between peat properties and land use, respectively, and CH4 dynamics. Samples were taken at three different depths and at four different seasons. Archaeal community composition varied considerably between the three peatlands and, to a certain degree, also with peat depth, but seemed to be quite stable at individual sampling depths throughout the year. Archaeal community composition was mainly linked to soil pH. No methanogens were detected at one fen site with soil pH ranging from 3.2 to 4.4. The methanogenic community of the bog (soil pH 3.9-4.6) was dominated by hydrogenotrophs, whereas the second fen site (soil pH 5.0-5.3) comprised both aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Overall, there seemed to be a significant coupling between peat type and archaeal community composition, with local hydrology modifying the strength of this coupling.

AB This study examined physiochemical conditions and prokaryotic community structure (the bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes and mcrA gene abundances and proportions), and evaluated the effect of reed canary grass cultivation and mineral fertilisation on these factors, in the 60 cm thick residual peat layer of experimental plots located on an abandoned peat extraction area. The archaeal proportion was 0.67-39.56% in the prokaryotic community and the methanogens proportion was 0.01-1.77% in the archaeal community. When bacterial abundance was higher in the top 20 cm of peat, the archaea were more abundant in the 20-60 cm layer and methanogens in the 40-60 cm layer of the residual peat. The bacterial abundance was significantly increased, but archaeal abundance was not affected by cultivation. The fertiliser application had a slight effect on peat properties and on archaeal and methanogen abundances in the deeper layer of cultivated peat. The CH4 emission was positively related to mcrA abundance in the 20-60 cm of the bare peat, while in case of reed canary grass cultivation these two parameters were not correlated. Reed canary grass cultivation mitigated CH4 emission, although methanogen abundance remained approximately the same or even increased in different layers of residual peat under cultivated sites over time. This study supports the outlook of using abandoned peat extraction areas to produce reed canary grass for energy purposes as an advisable landuse practice from the perspective of atmospheric impact in peatland-rich Northern Europe.

   EXCHANGE; VEGETATION; SOILS
AB Natural peatlands are important carbon sinks and sources of methane (CH4). In contrast, drained peatlands turn from a carbon sink to a carbon source and potentially emit nitrous oxide (N2O). Rewetting of peatlands thus potentially implies climate change mitigation. However, data about the time span that is needed for the re-establishment of the carbon sink function by restoration are scarce. We therefore investigated the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) balances of three differently vegetated sites of a bog ecosystem 30 years after rewetting. All three vegetation communities turned out to be sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) ranging between 0.6 +/-1.43 tCO(2) ha(-2) yr(-1) (Sphagnum-dominated vegetation) and 3.09 +/- 3.86 tCO(2) ha(-2) yr(-1) (vegetation dominated by heath). While accounting for the different global warming potential (GWP) of CO2, CH4 and N2O, the annual GHG balance was calculated. Emissions ranged between 25 and 53 tCO(2)-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) and were dominated by large emissions of CH4 (22-51 tCO(2)-eq ha(-1) yr(-1)), with highest rates found at purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea) stands. These are to our knowledge the highest CH4 emissions so far reported for bog ecosystems in temperate Europe. As the restored area was subject to large fluctuations in the water table, we assume that the high CH4 emission rates were caused by a combination of both the temporal inundation of the easily decomposable plant litter of purple moor grass and the plant-mediated transport through its tissues. In addition, as a result of the land use history, mixed soil material due to peat extraction and refilling can serve as an explanation. With regards to the long time span passed since rewetting, we note that the initial increase in CH4 emissions due to rewetting as described in the literature is not inevitably limited to a short-term period.

AB Forestry-drained peatlands in the boreal region are currently undergoing restoration in order to bring these ecosystems closer to their natural (undrained) state. Drainage affects the methane (CH4) dynamics of a peatland, often changing sites from CH4 sources to sinks. Successful restoration of a peatland would include restoration of not only the surface vegetation and hydrology, but also the microbial populations and thus CH4 dynamics. As a pilot study, CH4 emissions were measured on two pristine, two drained and three restored boreal spruce swamps in southern Finland for one growing season. Restoration was successful in the sense that the water table level in the restored sites was significantly higher than in the drained sites, but it was also slightly higher than in the pristine sites. The restored sites were surprisingly large sources of CH4 (mean emissions of 52.84 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)), contrasting with both the pristine (1.51 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) and the drained sites (2.09 mg CH4 m-(2) d(-1)). More research is needed to assess whether the high CH4 emissions observed in this study are representative of restored spruce mires in general.

AB We present data on a transitional mire in South-Western Siberia that evolved from early thermokarst lake succession. The vegetation of the mire shows a remarkable zonation from the edges to the center. Vegetation, peat characteristics, pH and electric conductivity were recorded at 10 sites along a transect of 1.5 km. At two of the transect points with contrasting vegetation and succession stage (floating mat vs. birch forest) pore water peepers were inserted once for 3 weeks and pore waters of the upper 60 cm were analyzed for major anions and cations, and dissolved CO2 and CH4 concentrations. Pore waters substantially differed between the floating mat and the birch forest regarding base cation chemistry and pH whilst nutrient availability was comparable. Compared to literature, depth integrated productions (DIPs) of CH4 and CO2 were high for both sites but three times higher for the floating mat (CH4 10.89 mmol m(-2) d(-1), CO2 34.19 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Along with other reasons, the higher DOC input at this location seems to be responsible for the higher DIP by fueling higher microbial activity. We discuss driving factors for biogeochemical differences between both sites and draw conclusions on CH4 production during mire evolution.

ID NORTHERN PEATLANDS; METHANE; WETLANDS; DYNAMICS; FOREST; SOILS
AB Peatlands, hydromorphous soils with high organic matter content, display, as a result of anaerobic conditions, a delayed litter decomposition and therefore constitute important terrestric sinks for carbon and nitrogen compounds. In spite of their relatively small area proportion of approx. 3% (3.88-4.38 x 10(6) km(2)), peatlands contain approx. 30% of the world's soil carbon and nitrogen reserves. Several signs indicate that substantial drainage and increasing temperatures due to the increasing cultivation of peatlands and the global climate change could result in a large-scale conversion of peatlands from C/N sinks to C/N sources. Irrespective of many uncertain details and complex interactions with other factors, the lowering of the groundwater table of peatlands actually seems to strongly enhance the net release of the radiatively active trace gases carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, reducing at the same time the high emissions of methane that occur in natural peatlands. The antizipated climate change will probably induce large-scale shifts in the distribution of the different peatland ecosystems along with considerable changes of the trace gas emissions. In view of this development, a net loss of global peatland area along with an increase in their contribution to the greenhouse effect must be expected.

AB Although northern peatlands contribute significantly to natural methane emissions, recent studies of the importance and type of methanogenesis in these systems have provided conflicting results. Mechanisms controlling methanogenesis in northern peatlands remain poorly understood, despite the importance of methane as a greenhouse gas. We used 16S rRNA gene retrieval and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to analyse archaeal communities in 15 high-latitude peatland sites in Alaska and three mid-latitude peatland sites in Massachusetts. Archaeal community composition was analysed in the context of environmental, vegetation and biogeochemical factors characterized in a parallel study. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Alaskan sites were dominated by a cluster of uncultivated crenarchaeotes and members of the families Methanomicrobiaceae and Methanobacteriaceae, which are not acetoclastic. Members of the acetoclastic family Methanosarcinaceae were not detected, whereas those of the family Methanosaetaceae were either not detected or were minor. These results are consistent with biogeochemical evidence that acetoclastic methanogenesis is not a predominant terminal decomposition pathway in most of the sites analysed. Ordination analyses indicated a link between vegetation type and archaeal community composition, suggesting that plants (and/or the environmental conditions that control their distribution) influence both archaeal community activity and dynamics.

AB Diurnal patterns of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) net fluxes were studied in a permanently submerged, Carex rostrata dominated Swiss alpine fen. Fluxes were measured in August and September using static chambers. Methane was emitted at all six time points analysed during each diurnal cycle with little variation between day, night or twilight (8.3 +/- 0.8 mg m(-2)h(-1) in August). The fen was a nighttime CO2 source (138 +/- 46 mg m(-2)h(-1)) and generally a daytime CO2 sink. Uptake of CO2 varied with light intensity (98 +/- 57 to 391 +/- 43 mg m(-2)h(-1) in August), but light saturation of photosynthesis was apparent at low irradiation levels. Emission or uptake of N2O was not discerned. In September, CH4 and CO2 fluxes were generally lower compared with August, compliant with less green C. rostrata biomass. Diurnal changes in subsurface properties were minor with little influence on the diurnal patterns. Temperature dependency of CH4 and CO2 emissions was apparent under controlled conditions using C. rostrata monoliths. In August, the fen showed highest photosynthetic rates and was a net carbon sink (50 mmol m(-2)day(-1)), but high CH4 emissions resulted in the fen being a net source of 250 mmol CO2 equivalents m(-2)day(-1).

AB Land atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) in peatlands exhibits marked seasonal and interannual variability, which subsequently affects the carbon (C) sink strength of catchments across multiple temporal scales. Long-term studies are needed to fully capture the natural variability and therefore identify the key hydrometeorological drivers in the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2. Since 2002, NEE has been measured continuously by eddycovariance at Auchencorth Moss, a temperate lowland peatland in central Scotland. Hence this is one of the longest peatland NEE studies to date. For 11 years, the site was a consistent, yet variable, atmospheric CO2 sink ranging from -5.2 to -135.9 g CO2-Cm-2 yr(-1) (mean of -64.1 +/- 33.6 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)). Inter-annual variability in NEE was positively correlated to the length of the growing season. Mean winter air temperature explained 87% of the inter-annual variability in the sink strength of the following summer, indicating an effect of winter climate on local phenology. Ecosystem respiration (R-eco) was enhanced by drought, which also depressed gross primary productivity (GPP). The CO2 uptake rate during the growing season was comparable to three other sites with long-term NEE records; however, the emission rate during the dormant season was significantly higher. To summarise, the NEE of the peatland studied is modulated by two dominant factors:
   - phenology of the plant community, which is driven by winter air temperature and impacts photosynthetic potential and net CO2 uptake during the growing season (colder winters are linked to lower summer NEE),
   - water table level, which enhanced soil respiration and decreased GPP during dry spells.
   Although summer dry spells were sporadic during the study period, the positive effects of the current climatic trend towards milder winters on the site's CO2 sink strength could be offset by changes in precipitation patterns especially during the growing season.

AB Ecosystem-scale methane (CH4) flux (F-CH4) over a subarctic fen at Churchill, Manitoba, Canada was measured to understand the magnitude of emissions during spring and fall shoulder seasons, and the growing season in relation to physical and biological conditions. F-CH4 was measured using eddy covariance with a closed-path analyser in four years (2008-2011). Cumulative measured annual F-CH4 (shoulder plus growing seasons) ranged from 3.0 to 9.6 gCH(4) m(-2) yr(-1) among the four study years, with a mean of 6.5 to 7.1 gCH(4) m(-2) yr(-1) depending upon gap-filling method. Soil temperatures to depths of 50 cm and air temperature were highly correlated with F-CH4, with near-surface soil temperature at 5 cm most correlated across spring, fall, and the shoulder and growing seasons. The response of F-CH4 to soil temperature at the 5 cm depth and air temperature was more than double in spring to that of fall. Emission episodes were generally not observed during spring thaw. Growing season emissions also depended upon soil and air temperatures but the water table also exerted influence, with F-CH4 highest when water was 2-13 cm below and lowest when it was at or above the mean peat surface.

TI Limited contribution of permafrost carbon to methane release from
   thawing peatlands
SO NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID VULNERABILITY; EMISSIONS; C-14
AB Models predict that thaw of permafrost soils at northern high latitudes will release tens of billions of tonnes of carbon (C) to the atmosphere by 2100 (refs 1-3). The effect on the Earth's climate depends strongly on the proportion of this C that is released as the more powerful greenhouse gas methane (CH4), rather than carbon dioxide (CO2) (refs 1,4); even if CH4 emissions represent just 2% of the C release, they would contribute approximately one-quarter of the climate forcing(5). In northern peatlands, thaw of ice-rich permafrost causes surface subsidence (thermokarst) and water-logging(6), exposing substantial stores (tens of kilograms of C per square meter, ref. 7) of previously frozen organic matter to anaerobic conditions, and generating ideal conditions for permafrost-derived CH4 release. Here we show that, contrary to expectations, although substantial CH4 fluxes (>20 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)) were recorded from thawing peatlands in northern Canada, only a small amount was derived from previously frozen C (<2 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)). Instead, fluxes were driven by anaerobic decomposition of recentCinputs. We conclude that thaw-induced changes in surface wetness and wetland area, rather than the anaerobic decomposition of previously frozen C, may determine the effect of permafrost thaw on CH4 emissions from northern peatlands.

AB Accurate estimates of methane (CH4) fluxes from restored peatlands are needed to inform emission factor estimations and reporting. Flux measurements are usually taken during the daytime but such measurements may provide biased estimates of overall CH4 emissions if night-time fluxes differ from daytime fluxes. Diurnal variations in CH4 fluxes have been reported for a range of peatland types, but not for restored raised bogs which are important carbon stores in some countries. To help fill this knowledge gap, we investigated diurnal variations in CH4 emissions from a restored raised bog. CH4 fluxes from a restored raised bog were measured in two 24-hr field campaigns using flux chambers. Carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were also monitored, as were a suite of complementary environmental variables. Night-time CH4 fluxes were significantly greater than daytime fluxes during both campaigns, by 10.4% and 36.1%, respectively. In Campaign 1 air temperature was the best predictor of CH4 fluxes, whereas in Campaign 2 net ecosystem exchange (NEE) values were the best predictor. This study shows that diurnal variations in CH4 fluxes exist in a restored peatland and that current approaches biased to daytime measurements will underestimate CH4 emissions from restored peatlands to the atmosphere.

AB Groundwater-fed fens are known sources of methane (CH4) emissions to the atmosphere, and these are known to be mediated by the vegetation. In a fen located in the Bale Mountains, Ethiopia, we assessed the effects of a cushion plant (Eriocaulon schimperi) and a sedge (Carex monostachya) on rhizosphere biogeochemistry.
   Methane and CO2 concentrations and pH were measured in pore-water at different depths in the profile. Redox potentials and NaCl-extractable element concentrations were analysed in soil samples from sites dominated by either E. schimperii or C. monostachya. Nutrient and element concentration were analysed in plant tissues.
   At Carex-dominated sites, CH4 concentrations increased from 70 mu mol.l(-1) at a depth of 10 cm to 130 mu mol.l(-1) at a depth of 100 cm. CH4 concentrations at Eriocaulon-dominated sites were almost zero (< 1 mu mol.l(-1)) to a depth of 100 cm. Simultaneously, soil redox potentials and CO2 concentrations were higher at Eriocaulon-dominated sites, indicating a low potential for CH4 production and a high potential for CH4 oxidation.
   Eriocaulon schimperi displayed a root investment strategy to cope with the harsh environment, similar to the cushion plant Astelia pumila in Patagonian bogs. This strategy is characterised by high root/shoot ratios, high root porosity and density under high redox conditions. Both cushion plant species create an aerobic rhizosphere through radial oxygen loss from deep roots, which strongly reduce CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere.

AB Smouldering wildfire in peatlands is one of the largest and longest-lasting fire phenomena on Earth, but whether peat can support a flaming fire like other surface fuels is still unclear. Our experiments demonstrate the successful piloted flaming ignition of peat soil with moisture up to 100 wt-% under external radiation, indicating that flames may rapidly spread on peatland before transitioning to a conventional smouldering peat fire. Compared with smouldering ignition, flaming ignition of peat is more difficult, requiring a higher minimum heat flux and tripling the ignition energy. The propensity for flaming increases with a drier peat and greater external heating. We also found that the flaming ignition temperature increases from 290 to 690 degrees C as the peat moisture increases to 100 wt-%. Flames from peat soil are much weaker than those of pine needles and wood, and they eventually transition to smouldering. The heat of flaming is estimated to be 13 MJ kg(-1), close to the heat of smouldering. The measured CO/CO2 ratio of flaming peat fires is less than 0.02, much smaller than 0.2 for smouldering peat fires. This research helps understand the development of peat fire and the interaction between flaming and smouldering wildland fires.

AB We measured year-round landscape-scale methane (CH4) flux in a boreal bog from May 2014 to April 2016 using the eddy covariance technique. The objectives of the study were to investigate the controls on CH4 flux at different periods of the growing season and to quantify the annual CH4 flux budget. The daily average growing season water table (WT) ranged from -0.33 to - 0.08 m in 2014 and from -0.36 to - 0.08 m in 2015. Strong seasonal variability in the daily average CH4 fluxes was observed in both 2014 and 2015, ranging from near zero before May to a peak of above 20 nmol m(-2) s(-1) in the middle-late August in 2014 and in the early-middle September in 2015. Soil temperature at 50 cm and water table exerted interactive impact on the seasonal variation in the daily average growing season CH4 flux in both years. Soil temperature at 1 cm was negatively related to CH4 flux when water table dropped more than 0.25 m below the peat surface in 2015 growing season, suggesting that the seasonal variation in CH4 flux was dominated by the variation due to CH 4 oxidation. During the non-growing season, the daily variation in CH4 fluxes was mostly related to friction velocity in both years. In addition, daily average CH4 flux was linearly related to net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) when daily NEE was negative (Le., days with CO2 uptake larger than ecosystem respiration), but there was no correlation between them when NEE was positive (days with ecosystem respiration dominated over CO2 uptake) during the growing season. We found that this boreal bog acted as a small CH4 source of 3.7 +/- 0.9 g CH4 m(-2) from May 2014 to April 2015 and 3.1 +/- 0.9 g CH4 m(-2) from May 2015 to April 2016. These values were at the lower end of the range of CH4 emission rates reported for boreal peatlands. Non-growing season CH4 emissions accounted for 41% (the first study year) and 39% (the second study year) of the annual emissions, highlighting the importance of non-growing season CH4 emissions in estimating the annual CH4 budget and the feedback to climate.

AB Peatlands, including fens, are important ecosystems in the context of the global carbon cycle. Future climate change and other anthropogenic activities are likely to increase nutrient loading in many peatland ecosystems and a better understanding of the effects of these nutrients on peatland carbon cycling is necessary. We investigated the effects of six years of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization, along with liming, on carbon mineralization dynamics in an intermediate fen in northern Minnesota. Specifically, we measured CO2 and CH4 emission from intact peat cores, as well as CH4 production and CH4 consumption at multiple depths in short-term laboratory incubations. Despite increased nitrogen and phosphorus availability in the upper 5 cm of peat, increased pH, and clear shifts in the vegetation community, fertilization and liming had limited effects on microbial carbon cycling in this fen. Liming reduced the net flux Of CO2 approximately 3-fold compared to the control treatment, but liming had no effect on CH4 emissions from intact cores. There were no nutrient effects on CO2 or CH4 emissions from intact cores. In all treatments, rates of CH4 production increased with depth and rates of CH4 consumption were highest near the in situ water-table level. However, nutrient and liming had no effect on rates of CH4 production or CH4 consumption at any depth. Our results suggest that over at least the intermediate term, the microbial communities responsible for soil carbon cycling in this peatland are tolerant to wide ranges of nutrient concentrations and pH levels and may be relatively insensitive to future anthropogenic nutrient stress.

AB Recent research indicates that accumulation and release of biogenic gas from northern peatlands may substantially affect future climate. Sudden release of free-phase gas bubbles into the atmosphere may preclude the conversion of methane to carbon dioxide in the uppermost oxic layer of the peat, resulting in greater contribution of methane to the atmosphere than is currently estimated. The hydrology of these peatlands also affects and is affected by this process, especially when gas is released suddenly and episodically. Indirect hydrological evidence indicates that ebullitive gas releases are relatively frequent in some peatlands and time-averaged rates may be significantly greater than diffusive releases. Estimates of free-phase gas contained in peat have ranged from 0 to nearly 20% of the peat volume. Abrupt changes in the volume of gas may alter hydraulic gradients and movement of water and solutes in peat, which in turn could alter composition and fluxes of the gas. Peat surfaces also move vertically and horizontally in response to accumulation and release of free-phase gas. Future research should address the distribution, temporal variability, and relative significance of ebullition in peatlands and the consequent hydrological responses to these gas-emission events.

AB Soil preparation to expedite stand establishment after clearcutting is an extensively applied measure in peatland forest regeneration sites particularly in Fennoscandinavia. Thus far, the impact of preparing peat soil on greenhouse gas fluxes is a chapter unwritten in GHG research on forestry-drained peatlands. Not only is such information vital in order to accurately estimate the GHG balance nationally, it may dictate the very methods used to regenerate forests on peat soils in the future. Over a 22-month period, we studied the impacts of mounding and scalping relative to the control on soil CO2 (heterotrophic peat soil respiration, SRp), CH4, and N2O fluxes along a moisture gradient in a nutrient-poor, clearcut forestry-drained peatland. First, we measured instantaneous gas fluxes (g m(-2) h(-1)) of the microsite types (unprepared, mound, pit, scalp) within a given treatment plot (control, mounding, scalping) in order to estimate their annual rates (g m(-2) a(-1)). Then, we estimated annual flux rates for each treatment comprehensively by considering the surface area-based distribution of microsite types in the corresponding treatment plot, and finally, the overall climatic impact of GHG emissions expressed in terms of CO2 equivalents (100-year GWP) 2-3 years after clearcutting and soil preparation. Compared to the control microsites, instantaneous CO2 emissions from scalps and pits were lower while those from mounds equivalent. However, increased CO2 emissions from the unprepared microsites within prepared plots were observed in respect to those of the control. Comprehensively, the annual CO2 emission rates differed little between treatments, ranging between 929 and 1078 g m(-2) a(-1). Hence, neither mounding nor scalping accelerated annual SRp relative to the control treatment. Annual fluxes of CH4 were dependent on the position of the water table. In our wet block, the mounding treatment led to the greatest annual CH4 emissions (3.62 g m(-2) a(-1)), followed by the control (2.14 g m(-2) a(-1)) and scalping (1.05 g m(-2) a(-1)); in the dry block, however, only the scalping treatment was a net, though minimal, source of CH4 (0.80 g m(-2) a(-1)) while the other two treatments effectively consumed CH4 (mounding -0.16 g m(-2) a(-1); control -0.05 g m(-2) a(-1)). Though annual N2O emission levels were low (0.05-0.08 g m(-2) a(-1)), both soil preparation treatments increased the flux of N2O from peat soil compared to the control. When considering the fluxes of all three greenhouse gases, the cumulative impact of soil preparation (mounding or scalping) on the global warming potential of the nutrient-poor, clearcut peatland forest was negligible in respect to the control.

AB Methane (CH4) is an important greenhouse gas, and it has been estimated that 50% of annual CH4 comes from terrestrial systems. Better and more accurate methods are needed to quantify CH4 flux from terrestrial environments. Two general methods commonly applied to measure trace gas fluxes are soil cover (chamber) techniques, and micrometeorology methods. Both of these methods has advantages and disadvantages, get little information is available concerning the relative performance of the techniques. This study was conducted to compare CH4 flux measurements obtained by using a closed-chamber soil cover technique and a micrometeorological method (Bowen-ratio Energy Balance [BREB]). Methane flux rates obtained by both methods were compared using nine time points over 3 d at a peatland site in north central Minnesota. Mean CH4 fluxes obtained by both methods were of the same magnitude (2.43-5.88 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)); however, differences were observed in the magnitudes of temporal variability as well as the detection sensitivities (minimum detectable flux). The minimum detectable flux for the closed-chamber method was 9.32 x 10(-2) mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), while the minimum detectable flux for the BREB method ranged from 2.16 to 25.5 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). Due to analytical uncertainties associated with gas chromatographic determination of CH4 gradients, the BREB is not recommended.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands are significantly promoted by global nitrogen input for changing the rate of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, and are substantially affected by soil labile carbon and nitrogen conversely. However, the driving mechanism by which soil labile carbon and nitrogen affect greenhouse gas emissions from wetland ecosystems under global nitrogen input is not well understood. Working out the driving factor of nitrogen input on greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands is critical to reducing global warming from nitrogen input. Thus, we synthesized 72 published studies (2144 paired observations) of greenhouse gas fluxes and soil labile compounds of carbon and nitrogen (ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, soil microbial biomass nitrogen and carbon), to understand the effects of labile carbon and nitrogen on greenhouse gas emissions under global nitrogen input. Across the data set, nitrogen input significantly promoted carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from wetlands. In particular, at lower nitrogen rates (<100 kg ha(-1).yr(-1)) and with added ammonium compounds, freshwater wetland significantly promoted carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Peatland was the largest nitrous oxide source under these conditions. This meta-analysis also revealed that nitrogen input stimulated dissolved organic carbon, ammonium, nitrate, microbial biomass carbon and microbial biomass nitrogen accumulation in the wetland ecosystem. The variation-partitioning analysis and structural equation model were used to analyze the relationship between the greenhouse gas and labile carbon and nitrogen further. These results revealed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the primary factor driving greenhouse gas emission from wetlands under global nitrogen input, whereas microbial biomass carbon (MBC) more directly affects greenhouse gas emission than other labile carbon and nitrogen.

AB The effects of land-use and land-use change on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes are of concern due to Kyoto Protocol requirements. To quantify the soil GHG-fluxes of afforested organic soils in Finland, chamber measurements of soil CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes were made during the years 2002 to 2005 on twelve organic soil cropland and six cutaway peatland sites afforested 9 to 35 years ago. The annual soil CO2 effluxes were statistically modelled using soil temperature as the driving variable and the annual CH4 and N2O fluxes were estimated using the average fluxes during the measurement period. Soil CO2 effluxes on afforested organic soil croplands varied from 207 to 539 g CO (2)-C m(-2) a-(1) and on cutaway peatlands from 276 to 479 g CO2-C m(-2) a(-1). Both the afforested organic soil cropland and cutaway peadand sites acted mainly as small sinks for CH 4; the annual flux ranged from -0.32 to 0.61 g CH4-C m(-2). Afforested organic croplands emitted more N2O (from 0. 1 to over 3.0 g N2O-N m(-2) a(-1)) than cutaway peatland sites (from 0.01 to 0.48 g N2O-N m(-2) a(-1)). Due to the decrease in soil CO2 efflux, and no change in CH4 and N2O fluxes, afforestation of organic croplands appears to decrease the greenhouse impact of these lands.

AB Because recent patterns of permafrost collapse in boreal peatlands appear to enhance emissions of CH4 to the atmosphere, we examined methanogenesis and methanogen diversity in peat soil from peatlands with and without permafrost in two peatland complexes situated in continental western Canada. Peat soil from the active layer of permafrost bogs had very low rates of CH4 production (ca. 10 nmol g(-1) day(-1)), and we were unable to PCR-amplify 16s rRNA gene sequences using Archaea-specific primers in four peat samples. Surface peat soil from continental bogs with no permafrost supported moderate rates of CH4 production (20-600 nmol g(-1) day(-1)), with maximum rates in soil located close to the mean water table level. Additions of ethanol stimulated CH4 production rates, suggesting metabolic substrate limitations. Peat from internal lawns, which have experienced surface permafrost degradation in the past 150 years, had very rapid rates of CH4 production (up to 800 nmol g(-1) day(-1)) occurring within the soil profile. Concomitant rates of anaerobic CO2 production were greater in continental bogs (ca. 6 mu mol g(-1) day(-1)) than in internal lawns (ca. 4 mu mol g(-1) day(-1)) or in permafrost bogs (2.8 mu mol g(-1) day(-1)). Analysis of the 16s rRNA gene for Archaea in the continental bog indicated mostly sequences associate with Methanobacteriales and RC-I with a Methanosarcinaceae sequence in the deepest peat soil. In the internal lawn, Methanosarcinaceae were most common in peat soil with a Methanosaetaceae sequence in the deepest peat soil. This study showed that patterns of discontinuous permafrost and ongoing permafrost degradation in boreal regions create patchy soil environments for methanogens and rates of methanogenesis.

AB Eddy covariance (EC) measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) were conducted on a boreal sedge fen in southern Finland (61 degrees 50 ' N 24 degrees 12 E) during a 1.5-yr period covering two summers in 2004-2005. The EC data were complemented by chamber measurements, which enabled the partition of the daytime NEE into respiration and photosy tithes is. A special emphasis was put on the hydrometeorological responses of CO, exchange during a drought period in July 2005. A mean CO2 efflux Of 0.009 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) was observed during mid-winter(January-February). while the night-time respiration during the two Julys averaged 0.09 mgCO(2) m(-2) s(-1). During both years the mean mid-day uptake in late July was about -0.16 mCO(2) m(-2) s(-1). An annual CO2 balance of -188 CO2 m(-2) was observed in 2005. A slightly higher net sink of -219 gCO(2)m(-2) was estimated for 2004. The drought period experienced in July 2005 caused a clear depression in the daily NEE values. From the combined analysis of EC and chamber measurements it was concluded that this was mainly due to increased respiration. but evidence was also found of suppressed photosynthesis due to a high VPD.

AB Permanent grasslands constitute the most widespread land use type for agriculturally managed peatlands in Europe. They are typically significant sources of CO2 to the atmosphere as a result of drainage-induced peat decomposition, but quantitative data are still scarce. This study presents an in-depth analysis of CO2 flux variability at the site (n=3) and plot scale (n=9) for different Danish permanent grasslands on peat. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and ecosystem respiration were monitored over one year with closed dynamic chambers. The first part of the data analysis consisted of a detailed evaluation of the flux dataset to gain insight into the potential effects of fast fluctuations in the wind and light intensity on the plot scale CO2 flux. In the second part of the analysis, gross photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration were modeled on the field and plot scale with candidate sets of simple light and temperature response models commonly applied in ecological studies. The detailed flux dataset analysis revealed that upward concave flux curves, which are not explainable by diffusion theory, can either be the result of a fan-induced increase in headspace turbulence, or of a photosynthesis overshoot into shaded or darkened chamber measurement periods. Instead of discarding such measurements from the dataset, this study proposes the use of linear flux calculation as a way to obtain less biased flux rate estimates. For the carbon balance modeling, it could be shown that annual NEE estimates for a site differ (0.2-0.3 kg CO2 m(-2)) between different models available for gap-filling CO2 flux time series even when the models were equally suitable according to statistical evaluation. Overall, all plots showed significant carbon losses over the course of a year (1.5-5.6 kg CO2 m(-2), including harvested aboveground biomass); however, it was not possible to relate spatial differences in the CO2 flux dynamics between and within the study sites to certain peat properties or management types due to high uncertainties in the annual estimates.

DE CH4 emission; N2O emission; peatland; permafrost thawing
AB Permafrost thawing may lead to the release of carbon and nitrogen in high-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere, mainly in the form of greenhouse gases. Our research aims to reveal the effects of permafrost thawing on CH4 and N2O emissions from peatlands in Xiaoxing'an Mountains, Northeast China. During four growing seasons (2011-2014), in situ CH4 and N2O emissions were monitored from peatland under permafrost no-thawing, mild-thawing, and severe-thawing conditions in the middle of the Xiaoxing'an Mountains by a static-chamber method. Average CH4 emissions in the severe-thawing site were 55-fold higher than those in the no-thawing site. The seasonal variation of CH4 emission became more aggravated with the intensification of permafrost thawing, in which the emission peaks became larger and the absorption decreased to zero. The increased CH4 emissions were caused by the expansion of the thawing layer and the subsequent increases in soil temperature, water table, and shifts of plant communities. However, N2O emissions did not change with thawing. Permafrost thawing increased CH4 emissions but did not impact N2O emissions in peatlands in the Xiaoxing'an Mountains. Increased CH4 emissions from peatlands in this region may amplify global warming.

AB We measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), plant biomass and growth, species composition, peat microclimate, and litter decomposition in a fertilization experiment at Mer Bleue Bog, Ottawa, Ontario. The bog is located in the zone with the highest atmospheric nitrogen deposition for Canada, estimated at 0.8-1.2 g N m(-2) yr(-1) (wet deposition as NH4 and NO3). To establish the effect of nutrient addition on this ecosystem, we fertilized the bog with six treatments involving the application of 1.6-6 g N m(-2) yr(-1) (as NH4NO3), with and without P and K, in triplicate 3 m x 3 m plots. The initial 5-6 years have shown a loss of first Sphagnum, then Polytrichum mosses, and an increase in vascular plant biomass and leaf area index. Analyses of NEE, measured in situ with climate-controlled chambers, indicate that contrary to expectations, the treatments with the highest levels of nutrient addition showed lower rates of maximum NEE and gross photosynthesis, but little change in ecosystem respiration after 5 years. Although shrub biomass and leaf area increased in the high nutrient plots, loss of moss photosynthesis owing to nutrient toxicity, increased vascular plant shading and greater litter accumulation contributed to the lower levels of CO2 uptake. Our study highlights the importance of long-term experiments as we did not observe lower NEE until the fifth year of the experiment. However, this may be a transient response as the treatment plots continue to change. Higher levels of nutrients may cause changes in plant composition and productivity and decrease the ability of peatlands to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere.

AB Combination of rewetting and wetland crop cultivation (paludiculture) is pursued as a wider carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation option in drained peatland. However, information on the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) balance for paludiculture is lacking. We investigated the GHG balance of peatlands grown with reed canary grass (RCG) and rewetted to various extents.
   Gas fluxes of CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured with a static chamber technique for 10 months from mesocosms sown with RCG and manipulated to ground water levels (GWL) of 0, -10, -20, -30 and -40 cm below the soil surface. Gross primary production (GPP) was estimated from the above ground biomass yield.
   The mean dry biomass yield across all water table treatments was 6 Mg ha(-1) with no significant differences between the treatments. Raising the GWL to the surface decreased both the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and N2O emissions whereas CH4 emissions increased. Total cumulative GHG emissions (for 10 months) corresponded to 0.08, 0.13, 0.61, 0.68 and 0.98 kg CO2 equivalents m(-2) from the GWL treatments at 0, -10, -20, -30 and -40 cm below the soil surface, respectively.
   The results showed that a reduction in total GHG emission can be achieved without losing the productivity of newly established RCG when GWL is maintained close to the surface. Further studies should address the practical constrains and long-term productivity of RCG cultivation in rewetted peatlands.

AB The postglacial development of peatland systems has had a strong influence on the global carbon cycle. Peatland effects on carbon cycling involve changes in both large-scale structure and community composition. The rate of C sequestration declines as a peat deposit grows, and methane emission increases as wet microhabitats expand in area. We examine the theoretical basis, underlying assumptions, and empirical evidence for two highly influential models of peatland form and development: Clymo's bog growth model (BGM) and Ingram's groundwater mound hypothesis (GMH). Our detailed theoretical analysis reveals previously unrecognized consequences of the models and, for the BGM, unrealistically stringent conditions for application. Our review of model assumptions and empirical evidence identifies the principal limitations of these models: they ignore spatial heterogeneity in peatland structure and function, fast processes occurring near the peatland surface, and interactions between peat accumulation and hydrological conditions. As a result, these models are unable to predict the effects of bog growth on hydrological conditions or peat-forming processes.
   We introduce five conceptual models of peatland development that differ in how bog size and shape change over time, and we examine the consequences of each model for hydrological conditions. This exercise shows how bog height growth and lateral expansion change the boundary conditions constraining peatland dynamics, and so determine the direction of ecosystem development. We link peatland properties to the four general properties of ''complex adaptive systems'' (CAS): spatial heterogeneity, localized flows, self-organizing structure and nonlinearity. We also present a framework for modeling peatlands as CAS. In this framework, the system is disaggregated, both vertically and horizontally, into a set of components that interact locally through flows of energy and resources. Both internal dynamics and external forcing drive changes in hydrological conditions and microhabitat pattern, and these autogenic and allogenic changes in peatland structure affect hydrological processes, which, in turn, constrain peatland development and carbon cycling. We conclude by outlining four areas in which further empirical research is urgently needed.

AB Northern forests and peatlands are globally significant elements in carbon (C) cycling. Recent research has also highlighted the role of aquatic ecosystems in landscape C budgets. We measured contemporary carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange, lateral C transfer (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CO2, CH4), and long-term C accumulation in a peatland-stream-lake-continuum in north boreal Finland. On an annual scale the peatland, a rich fen, was a relatively strong C sink (27 g Cm-2 a(-1)). The stream that traversed through the fen had high CO2 and CH4 effluxes (on average 480 and 12 g C m(-2) a(-1), respectively) to the atmosphere, while the small oligotrophic lake was a small C gas source per unit area (15 g C m(-2) a(-1)). A catchment C budget was compiled by supplementing these measured values with literature values for the forests. The aquatic C fluxes equaled similar to 13% of the net C input by the forest and peatlands in the catchment, and the largest component was the downstream transfer of DOC. This study supports the proposition that ignoring the aquatic component would result in an overestimated regional C uptake. The contemporary net C input estimate for the fen, after accounting for the C transfer, was larger than the long-term C accumulation rate based on peat cores (22 versus 6.3-16.0 g C m(-2) a(-1)). This study provides reference values for both the contemporary C exchange and long-term C accumulation history, and the terrestrial-aquatic linkage from the boreal-subarctic ecotone, which is vulnerable to ongoing climatic change.

AB Northern peatlands play an important role globally in the cycling of C, through the exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere, the emission of CH4, the production and export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the storage of C. Under 2 x CO2 GCM scenarios, most Canadian peatlands will be exposed to increases in mean annual temperature ranging between 2 and 6 degrees C and increases in mean annual precipitation of 0 to 15 %, with the most pronounced changes occurring during the winter. The increase in CO2 uptake by plants, through warmer temperatures and elevated atmospheric CO2, is likely to be offset by increased soil respiration rates in response to warmer soils and lowered water tables. CH4 emissions are likely to decrease in most peatlands because of lowered water tables, except where the peat surface adjusts to fluctuating water tables, and in permafrost, where the collapse of dry plateau and palsa will lead to increased CH4 emission. There likely will be little change in DOC production, but DOC export to water bodies will decrease as runoff decreases. The storage of C in peatlands is sensitive to all C cycle components and is difficult to predict. The challenge is to develop quantitative models capable of making these predictions for different peatlands. We present some qualitative responses, with levels of uncertainty. There will be, however, as much variation in response to climatic change within a peatland as there will be among peatland regions.

AB Pristine peatlands covered by Histosols (bogs and fens) with high water table and a restricted oxygen (O-2) availability are known to have low emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) but may be a significant source for atmospheric methane (CH4) which are both important greenhouse gases. For the first time N2O and CH4 fluxes of a pristine slope mire in the German Harz Mountains have been monitored. Previously reported peatlands are characterised by anaerobic conditions due to high water table levels. Slope mires monitored here receive O-2 through slope water inflow. Gas fluxes have been monitored deploying closed chamber method on a central non-forested area and a forested area at the periphery of the slope mire. By means of groundwater piezometers water table levels, ammonium and nitrate contents as well as hydro-chemical variables like oxygen content and redox potential of the mire pore water have been concurrently measured with trace gas fluxes at both monitoring sites of the slope mire. The slope mire took up small amounts of atmospheric methane at a rate of -0.02 +/- 0.01 kg C ha(-1) year(-1) revealing no significant difference between the forested and non-forested site. Higher uptake rates were observed during low water table level. In contrast to pristine peatlands influx of oxygen containing pore water into slope mire does limit reduction processes and resultant CH4 emission. N2O fluxes of the forested and non-forested sites of the slope mire did not differ and amounted to 0.25 +/- 0.44 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). Higher emissions were observed at low water table levels and during thawing periods. In spite of favourable conditions N2O fluxes of the slope mire have been comparable to those of pristine peatlands.

ID NORTHERN WETLANDS; PEATLANDS; FLUXES; TUNDRA; DEPTH; CO2; CH4
AB Wetlands are a major contributor to the global methane (CH4) budget, currently there is a consensus view that drought restrains CH4 emissions from wetlands. However, a 6-year field experiment investigating the effects of persistent summer water table drawdown on a gully mire in mid-Wales, U.K. demonstrated a 2-year "boom and bust" cycle of CH4 emissions followed by a recovery during the third year, when compared with emissions from a control wetland in which the water table remained at or above the peat surface. This cyclical trend was subsequently replicated by the control wetland following natural summer drought. The experimental wetland was affected less by this natural drought following previous water table drawdown. Depth profiles of CH4 production suggested that consecutive water table drawdown resulted in a translocation of peak methanogen activity lower down the peat profile, where emissions were affected less by subsequent drawdown. These findings suggest that wetland CH4 flux models need to consider the possibility that methane emission-water table relationships are dependent on the pattern and frequency of drought events.

AB Samples of organic material derived from two hummock-forming species (Sphagnum fuscum and S. rubellum) and two hollow species (Sphagnum cuspidatum and S. magellanicum) were collected from several depths in a southern Swedish raised bog and rates of CO2 emission were measured in the laboratory under aerated conditions at 18-degrees-C. The rate of CO2 release from the most recently deposited Sphagnum peat litter from the 2.5-5 cm depth layer was nearly twice as high (0.66 mg CO2 g-1 d-1) as that from older organic material from the 10-12.5 cm depth layer (0.35 mg CO2 g-1 d-1) under common conditions of temperature, moisture and aeration. No consistent differences in CO2 emission rates were detected among the four Sphagnum species for the shallow organic material tested. However, when deeper (50-100 cm) Sphagnum-dominated peat samples were exposed to the same aerated conditions, peat formed by the hummock-forming species released CO2 at a slower rate (0.23 mg g-1 d-1) than the two hollow species (0.29 mg g-1 d-1). The results suggest that the amount of previous exposure of Sphagnum peat to decay processes may be more important than the species composition in determining subsequent rates of decay and carbon loss.
   The observed rates of CO2 emission were used to estimate the annual mass loss from aerobically decaying organic material under the thermal regime at the study site. Based on these estimates, Sphagnum litter loses about 5% of its dry mass annually during the initial stages of decay, but the decay rate decreases to 2-3% annually for deeper Sphagnum peat exposed to aerobic conditions.

AB Background: Northern peatlands are known for having significant stocks of terrestrial soil carbon (C). However, little is known about how peatlands function under various land uses and what impacts land-use change has on their functioning in central Europe.
   Aim: The objective of our study was to quantify the variability and controls of typical plant communities in terms of C gas dynamics on bogs and fens affected by a changed hydrological regime in the Bohemian Forest, Czech Republic.
   Methods: Carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange and methane emissions (CH4) were measured in bogs (pristine, drained, restored) and in fens (pristine, drained) during the 2009 growing season. We applied cluster analysis to define plant communities and non-linear response models to quantify the variation in CO2 dynamics among the communities.
   Results: Drainage had a strong impact on vegetation; forest and meadows species were dominant on drained peatland sites and the vascular green area was higher than on pristine sites. The net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) varied from -27 to 241 g CO2-C m(-2) per growing season on the bogs and from 27 to 153 g m(-2) on the fens. The most-drained parts of the bog and fen with the most changed vegetation structure acted as both net C sources and very weak C sinks; however, areas dominated by Molinia caerulea acted as a strong C sink. Plant communities on the wetter parts of drained sites had a positive seasonal NEE, comparable with NEE on pristine sites. Seasonal CH4 emissions were relatively low (0-9 g CH4-C m(-2)) at all sites and did not influence net C balance, with the exception of pristine fen where CH4 emissions with average 90 g C m(-2) led to a negative total growing season C balance. Water regime restoration caused neither a significant change in plant composition nor any major changes, such as plant die-back or increased CH4 emissions during the first season after restoration.
   Conclusions: Our results showed that C gas fluxes, and in turn the C balance of the whole ecosystem, were largely determined by plant community type. Drainage did not necessarily lead to a negative ecosystem C balance; however, a significant change of species composition occurred on most drained areas. The less-drained parts on drained sites, where original peatland species and original functions are preserved, could facilitate future ecosystem restoration.

AB Degradation of organic carbon stored in permafrost may represent an additional source of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) in a warming climate. However, there is no clear understanding of how seasonal freeze-thaw affects gas permeability and emission of methane in permafrost soils, in part due to the lack of chemical and physical characterisation of the soils. Here, we report vertical profiles of CO2, CH4 and other soil properties with resolutions of 0.05-0.1m depth from five soil cores, drilled to 0.9m depth, in Alaskan permafrost during the early spring of 2013, when the ground was frozen under snow cover. Two cores from tundra and black spruce bog showed sudden increases in methane concentration (up to 416 mu mol litre(soil)(-1)), indicating excess CH4 trapped in gas-impermeable soil layers during the freezing period. Active-layer cooling in late autumn, producing a frozen surface and relatively warm sub-surface, may have allowed underground microbial activity and facilitated CH4 production, while the upward transport of CH4 was hampered by the frost. Our preliminary results show that estimating annual GHG efflux from permafrost regions can be complicated because of heterogeneous distributions of trapped methane within soil columns.

AB Northeast China contains a large concentration of wetlands, primarily in two prominent types, freshwater marshes on the lowlands plains to the northeast and mountain permafrost peatlands in the north. Both wetlands types are threatened by disturbance, the marshes from agricultural conversion and the peatlands due to climate warming and loss of permafrost. Here we compare two seasons of ecosystem-scale CH4 fluxes measured via eddy covariance for a permafrost peatland in the Da Xing'anling Mountains and a freshwater marsh on the Sanjiang Plain. The objectives were to quantify CH4 fluxes, compare seasonal trends in the flux and determine the dominant environmental and biophysical drivers of the CH4 flux for these two distinct wetland types.
   CH4 fluxes at the marsh had a strong seasonal trend peaking in mid-summer, while the pattern for the peatland was muted. Maximum instantaneous fluxes were 1.34 mu g CH4 m(-2) s(-3). and 9.5 mu g CH4 m(-2) s(-3) at the peatland and marsh, respectively. Total seasonal CH4 emissions for the peatland, 0.38.4.27 g C-CH4 m(-2), were an order of magnitude smaller than those at the marsh, 19.71-21.8 g C-CH4 m(-2). Differences between years were small for both wetlands. We used path analysis to examine environmental and biophysical drivers of the flux and found that soil temperature (average soil temperature between 10 cm to 60 cm depths for the peatland and 10 cm depth for the marsh) was most strongly correlated with seasonal CH4 variability for both wetlands. Secondary influences were thaw depth for the peatland and net ecosystem CO2 exchange for the marsh.
   Given the temperature sensitivity of CH4 flux for both of these wetlands, future climate warming will likely increase CH4 emissions in northeast China, as well, the continued loss of permafrost in the mountain peatlands will likely further contribute to enhanced CH4 emissions.

DT Article
DE Cultivated peatlands; Drainage; WTL; CO2 CH4; BASGRA-BGC model
AB Cultivated peatlands under drainage practices contribute significant carbon losses from agricultural sector in the Nordic countries. In this research, we developed the BASGRA-BGC model coupled with hydrological, soil carbon decomposition and methane modules to simulate the dynamic of water table level (WTL), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions for cultivated peatlands. The field measurements from four experimental sites in Finland, Denmark and Norway were used to validate the predictive skills of this novel model under different WTL management practices, climatic conditions and soil properties. Compared with daily observations, the model performed well in terms of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error; 0.06-0.11 m, 1.22-2.43 gC/m(2)/day, and 0.002-0.330 kgC/ha/day for WTL, CO2 and CH4, respectively), NRMSE (Normalized Root Mean Square Error; 10.3-18.3%, 13.0-18.6%, 15.3-21.9%) and Pearson's r (Pearson correlation coefficient; 0.60-0.91, 0.76-0.88, 0.33-0.80). The daily/ seasonal variabilities were therefore captured and the aggregated results corresponded well with annual estimations. We further provided an example on the model's potential use in improving the WTL management to mitigate CO2 and CH4 emissions while maintaining grass production. At all study sites, the simulatedWTLs and carbon decomposition rates showed a significant negative correlation. Therefore, controlling WTL could effectively reduce carbon losses. However, given the highly diverse carbon decomposition rates within individual WTLs, adding indicators (e.g. soil moisture and peat quality) would improve our capacity to assess the effectiveness of specific mitigation practices such as WTL control and rewetting.

AB The dynamic carbon balance of a southeastern New Hampshire wetland was constructed for the 1994 growing season using a light-dark box sampling method. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) (n=414) and ecosystem respiration (n=234) measurements were made at the 1.7 ha Sphagnum spp. dominated poor fen. The NEE rates ranged from -192 to 492 mg C m(-2) h(-1) and the ecosystem respiration measurements were between -10 and -365 mg C m(-2) h(-1). The negative values represent a loss of carbon from the wetland system. NEE and respiration data were used to derive photosynthesis rates of the vegetation at the study site. A simple model, using hourly averages of photosynthetically active radiation, and air and soil temperatures to generate hourly rates of photosynthesis and respiration, was constructed to interpolate the carbon cycling rates at this fen through the entire 1994 growing season. Results of the carbon balance model suggest that the wetland lost an estimated 145 g C m(-2) for the 9 month modeling period (April through December). The 1994 climate season was warmer (+1.15 degrees C/month) and drier (-12.3 cm) than the 30 year normals for Durham, New Hampshire, the nearest meteorological station. These data suggest that if future climate change brings about warmer temperatures and lower water tables in peatland soils, positive climatic feedback leading to substantial releases of CO2 from boreal and subarctic peatlands is probable.

AB We determined the landscape variation of forest floor (FF) CO2 uptake (photosynthesis, P), FF CO2 emission (respiration, R) in relation to net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and environmental factors along a forest-mire ecotone in Finland. The 450 m long ecotone extended from xeric, upland pine dominated habitats, through spruce and transitional spruce-pine-birch forest, to sedge peatlands downslope. The CO2 fluxes were measured at nine stations during 2005 using chamber and IR techniques. Instantaneous P and R measurements for each station were interpolated by fitting their response to continuous records of light (mean R-2 = 0.66) and temperature (mean R-2 = 0.77) recorded nearby to give annual estimates. Stand biomass increment was used to estimate the annual CO2 exchange contribution of the trees. Annual P values from -307 to -1632 gCO(2)m(-2)yr(-1) were inversely correlated with FF light (r = -0.96), FF above-ground biomass (r = -0.92) and canopy openness (r = -0.95). Annual R values from 1263 to 2813 gCO(2) m(-2) yr(-1) were correlated with tree stand foliar biomass (r = 0.77). Estimated NEE values varied from 546 to -1679 gCO(2)m(-2)/yr(-1), with P contributing from -307 to -1632 gCO(2)m(-2)yr(-1) (4-90%) to gross ecosystem photosynthetic production (GPP), and R from 1263 to 2813 gCO(2)m(-2)yr(-1) (70-98%) to gross ecosystem respiration (GR).

AB The thawing and subsidence of frozen peat mounds (palsas) in permafrost landscapes results in the formation of organic-rich thermokarst lakes. We examined the effects of palsa degradation on CH4 and CO2 emissions by comparing thermokarst lakes at two peatland locations in subarctic Quebec, Canada: in the northern discontinuous permafrost region, and in southern sporadic permafrost where palsas are more rapidly degrading. The lakes were shallow (< 3 m) but stratified at both sites, and most had anoxic bottom waters. The surface waters at both sites were supersaturated in CH4 and CO2, and to a greater extent in the southern lakes, where the surface CH4 concentrations were up to 3 orders of magnitude above air equilibrium. Concentrations of CH4 and CO2 increased by orders of magnitude with depth in the southern lakes, however these gradients were less marked or absent in the North. Strong CH4 and CO2 emissions were associated with gas ebullition, but these were greatly exceeded by diffusive fluxes, in contrast to thermokarst lakes studied elsewhere. Also unusual relative to other studies to date, the surface concentrations of both gases increased as a linear function of water column depth, with highest values over the central, deepest portion of the lakes. Radiocarbon dating of ebullition gas samples showed that the CH4 had C-14-ages from 760 yr to 2005 yr before present, while the CO2 was consistently younger. Peatland thermokarst lakes may be an increasingly important source of greenhouse gases as the southern permafrost limit continues to shift northwards.

AB Natural wetlands form the largest source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Emission of this powerful greenhouse gas from wetlands is known to depend on climate, with increasing temperature and rainfall both expected to increase methane emissions. This study, combining our field and controlled environment manipulation studies in Europe and North America, reveals an additional control: an emergent pattern of increasing suppression of methane (CH4) emission from peatlands with increasing sulfate (SO42-S) 4 deposition, within the range of global acid deposition. We apply a model of this relationship to demonstrate the potential effect of changes in global sulfate deposition from 1960 to 2080 on both northern peatland and global wetland CH4 emissions. We estimate that sulfur pollution may currently counteract climate-induced growth in the wetland source, reducing CH4 emissions by approximate to15 Tg or 8% smaller than it would be in the absence of global acid deposition. Our findings suggest that by 2030 sulfur pollution may be sufficient to reduce CH4 emissions by 26 Tg or 15% of the total wetland source, a proportion as large as other components of the CH4 budget that have until now received far greater attention. We conclude that documented increases in atmospheric CH4 concentration since the late 19th century are likely due to factors other than the global warming of wetlands.

AB Acidic Sphagnum peat bogs cover a considerable part of the territory of Russia and are an important natural source of biogenic methane, which is formed in their anaerobic layers. A considerable portion of this methane is consumed in the aerobic part of the bog profile by acidophilic methanotrophic bacteria, which comprise the methane filter of Sphagnum peat bogs and decrease CH4 emission to the atmosphere. For a long time, these bacteria escaped isolation, which became possible only after the elucidation of the optimal conditions of their functioning in situ: pH 4.5-5.5; temperature, from 15 to 20 degreesC; and low salt concentration in the solution. Imitation of these conditions and rejection of earlier used media with a high content of biogenic elements allowed methanotrophic bacteria of two new genera and species-Methylocella palustris and Methylocapsa acidiphila-to be isolated from the peat of Sphagnum peat bogs of European northern Russia and western Siberia. These bacteria are well adapted to the conditions in cold, acidic, oligotrophic Sphagnum peat bogs. They grow in a pH range of 4.2-7.5 with an optimum at 5.0-5.5, prefer moderate temperatures (15-25 degreesC) and media with a low content of mineral salts (200-500 mg/l), and are capable of active dinitrogen fixation. Design of fluorescently labeled 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes for the detection of Methylocella palustris and Methylocapsa acidiphila and their application to the analysis of sphagnum peat samples showed that these bacteria represent dominant populations of methanotrophs with a density of 10(5)-10(6) cells/g peat. In addition to Methylocella and Methylocapsa populations, one more abundant population of methanotrophs was revealed (10(6) cells/g peat), which were phylogenetically close to the genus Methylocystis.

AB Peat chemistry appears to exert primary control over methane production rates in the Canadian Northern Wetlands Study (NOWES) area. We determined laboratory methane production rate potentials in anaerobic slurries of samples collected from a transect of sites through the NOWES study area. We related methane production rates to indicators of resistance to microbial decay (peat C:N and lignin:N ratios) and experimentally manipulated substrate availability for methanogenesis using ethanol (EtOH) and plant litter. We also determined responses of methane production to pH and temperature. Methane production potentials declined along the gradient of sites from high rates in the coastal fens to low rates in the interior bogs and were generally highest in surface layers. Strong relationships between CH4 production potentials and pest chemistry suggested that methanogenesis was limited by fermentation rates. Methane production at ambient pH responded strongly to substrate additions in the circumneutral fens with narrow lignin:N and C:N ratios (partial derivative CH4/partial derivative EtOH = 0.9-2.3mg g(-1)) and weakly in the acidic bogs with wide C:N and lignin:N ratios (partial derivative CH4/partial derivative EtOH = -0.04-0.02 mg g(-1)). Observed Q(10) values ranged from 1.7 to 4.7 and generally increased with increasing substrate availability, suggesting that fermentation rates were limiting. Titration experiments generally demonstrated inhibition of methanogenesis by low pH. Our results suggest that the low rates of methane emission observed in interior bogs during NOWES likely resulted from pH and substrate quality limitation of the fermentation step in methane production and thus reflect intrinsically low methane production potentials. Low methane emission rates observed during NOWES will likely be observed in other northern wetland regions with similar vegetation chemistry.

AB Over half of the world's peat originated from Sphagnum, representing 10-15% of the terrestrial carbon stock. However, information regarding the release and exudation of organic carbon by living Sphagnum plants into the surface peat is scarce. In this study, we examined the contribution of recent Sphagnum subnitens (Russ. and Warnst.) photosynthate carbon to the peatland dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. This was done using a (CO2)-C-13 pulse-chase experimental approach during the growing season. Despite the importance of Sphagnum in long-term carbon accumulation, results showed that the Sphagnum community rapidly contributes recently synthesized carbon to the peatland DOC pool. We estimate that by 4 h up to 4% of the total DOC in peat leachate was derived from (CO2)-C-13 pulse labelling at ambient CO2 concentrations. Nonetheless, a huge 64% of the C-13 initially assimilated by photosynthesis was retained in Sphagnum subnitens for 23 days after labelling, consistent with the role of Sphagnum in peatland carbon accumulation. The majority of C-13 loss as respired CO2 came within the few days post (CO2)-C-13 labelling, suggesting that it was derived from plant respiration of photosynthates.

AB About 60% of the European wetlands are located in the European part of Russia. Nevertheless, data on methane emissions from wetlands of that area are absent. Here we present results of methane emission measurements for two climatically different years from a boreal peatland complex in European Russia. Winter fluxes were well within the range of what has been reported for the peatlands of other boreal regions before, but summer fluxes greatly exceeded the average range of 5-80 mgCH(4) m(-2) d(-1) for the circumpolar boreal zone. Half of the measured fluxes ranged between 150 and 450 mgCH(4) m (2) d (1). Extrapolation of our data to the whole boreal zone of European Russia shows that theses emissions could amount to up to 2.7 +/- 1.1 TgCH(4) a(-1), corresponding to 69% of the annual emissions from European wetlands or 33% of the total annual natural European methane emission. In 2008, climatic conditions corresponded to the long term mean, whereas the summer of 2011 was warmer and noticeably drier. Counterintuitively, these conditions led to even higher CH4 emissions, with peaks up to two times higher than the values measured in 2008. As Russian peatlands dominate the areal extend of wetlands in Europe and are characterized by very high methane fluxes to the atmosphere, it is evident, that sound European methane budgeting will only be achieved with more insight into Russian peatlands.

AB Homoacetogenic bacteria can play an important role in anaerobic degradation of organic matter in peatlands at low temperatures. However, little is known about the conditions when they come on the scene. We carried out incubation experiments with peat samples from a West-Siberian eutrophic fen in the presence and absence of inhibitor sodium fluoroacetate (CH2FCOONa) and proposed the employment of dynamic modeling to clarify the contributions of different groups of bacteria and archaea to the degradation of organic matter to CH4 and CO2. At the end of experiments, CH4 content in the headspace was 2.6-3.1 times higher than that of CO2; pH values of peat solution were between 6.5 and 7.0. Dynamic modeling of CH4 and CO2 and their isotopic signatures showed that CH4 was predominantly produced through homoacetogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis, while hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis played a minor role in the process. Inhibitor addition led to a change in the pathway of methane formation to H-2-dependent methanogenesis. The comparatively large differences in the quantitative output of methane from different samples taken from the same field site were interpreted as a consequence of variation in the initial concentrations of biomass, cellulose, acetate, methane, and CO2. These differences also led to variations in the proportions of methane formed from acetate and H-2/CO2.

AB Thawing permafrost in the sub-Arctic has implications for the physical stability and biological dynamics of peatland ecosystems. This study provides an analysis of how permafrost thawing and subsequent vegetation changes in a sub-Arctic Swedish mire have changed the net exchange of greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 over the past three decades. Images of the mire (ca. 17 ha) and surroundings taken with film sensitive in the visible and the near infrared portion of the spectrum, [i.e. colour infrared (CIR) aerial photographs from 1970 and 2000] were used. The results show that during this period the area covered by hummock vegetation decreased by more than 11% and became replaced by wet-growing plant communities. The overall net uptake of C in the vegetation and the release of C by heterotrophic respiration might have increased resulting in increases in both the growing season atmospheric CO2 sink function with about 16% and the CH4 emissions with 22%. Calculating the flux as CO2 equivalents show that the mire in 2000 has a 47% greater radiative forcing on the atmosphere using a 100-year time horizon. Northern peatlands in areas with thawing sporadic or discontinuous permafrost are likely to act as larger greenhouse gas sources over the growing season today than a few decades ago because of increased CH4 emissions.

A pulse-chase experiment using(13)C-labelled methane in the field clearly showed label uptake in diploptene, a biomarker for methanotrophs, demonstrating in situ methanotrophic activity inSphagnumunder natural conditions. Peat cores containing liveSphagnumwere incubated at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C for two months, causing differences in net methane fluxes. The natural delta C-13 values of diploptene extracted fromSphagnumshowed a strong correlation with temperature and methane production. The delta C-13 values ranged from -34 parts per thousand at 5 degrees C to -41 parts per thousand at 25 degrees C.These results are best explained by enhanced expression of the methanotrophic enzymatic isotope effect at higher methane concentrations. Hence, delta C-13 values of diploptene, or its diagenetic products, potentially provide a useful tool to assess methanotrophic activity in past environments. Increased methane fluxes towardsSphagnumdid not affect delta C-13 values of bulkSphagnumand its specific marker, the C(23)n-alkane. The concentration of methanotroph-specific bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs), aminobacteriohopanetetrol (aminotetrol, characteristic for type II and to a lesser extent type I methanotrophs) and aminobacteriohopanepentol (aminopentol, a marker for type I methanotrophs) showed a non-linear response to increased methane fluxes, with relatively high abundances at 25 degrees C compared to those at 20 degrees C or below. Aminotetrol was more abundant than aminopentol, in contrast to similar abundances of aminotetrol and aminopentol in freshSphagnum. This probably indicates that type II methanotrophs became prevalent under the experimental conditions relative to type I methanotrophs. Even though BHP concentrations may not directly reflect bacterial activity, they may provide insight into the presence of different types of methanotrophs.

AB As part of the Canadian Northern Wetlands Study (NOWES) measurements of methane flux were made at the Kinosheo Lake tower site for a 1-month period during the 1990 summer intensive. The measurements were made with a diode-laser-based methane sensor using the eddy correlation technique. Measurements of the methane fluxes were made at two levels, 5 or 18 m. Approximately 900 half-hour average methane flux measurements were obtained. Weak temporal and diurnal trends were observed in the data. Fluxes averaged over the study period showed an overall methane emission of 16 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) with a daytime average of 20 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) and a nighttime average of 9 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). The effect of emission footprint was evident in the data. A strong relationship between the daily average methane flux and wet bog temperature at 20-cm depth was observed.

AB In this 3-yr study, we investigated temporal and spatial changes in pools of pore-water methane, sulfate, and acetate (a methanogenic substrate), along with corresponding methane fluxes. Acetate accumulated to high concentrations (>500 mu M) in the shallow pore waters in winter and spring, indicating that acetogenic bacteria were metabolically active at 2-10 degrees C. High sulfate concentrations in the upper pore waters of one site delayed onset of acetate accumulation, suggesting that acetate consumption by sulfate-reducing bacteria or competition between H-2-consuming sulfate-reducers and autotrophic acetogens caused the delay. Sites dominated by grasses and sedges had larger accumulations of acetate; pore-water pools and fluxes of methane increased rapidly following diminution of the acetate pools at these sites. At a site dominated by Chamaedaphne calyculata, an ericaceous shrub, methane fluxes were lower by 2-3 orders of magnitude; little accumulation of acetate or methane was observed, except in the third year of the study when water levels were consistently high. The seasonal accumulation of acetate and subsequent methane production and flux seem to be dependent on long-term anaerobic conditions in the upper 20 cm of surface peat.

AB Peatlands contain large amount of carbon stock that is vulnerable to release into the atmosphere. Mostly because of human impact, the peatlands at Zoige Wetlands face severe degradation, and the groundwater table is now lower than before, which has increased the population of the plateau zokor, a burrowing rodent. However, the impact of these changes on ecosystem carbon flows has not been studied. To investigate how the plateau zokor and the groundwater level alter the ecosystem respiration of the Zoige peatlands, we sampled the CO2 flux of hummocks shaped by the zokors and compared it with the CO2 flux of undisturbed sites with different groundwater table levels. The soil organic carbon (SOC), soil water content (SWC) and soil temperature at 5 cm (T-5) were measured. SOC showed no significant difference among the four sampling sites and did not correlate with the CO2 flux, while SWC was found to partly determine the CO2 flux. A linear equation could adequately describe the relationship between the natural logarithm of the ecosystem respiration and the soil temperature. It is demonstrated that descending groundwater table might accelerate ecosystem respiration and the CO2 flux from hummocks was higher than the CO2 flux from the control site in the non-growing season. With rising temperature, the CO2 flux from the control site accelerated faster than that from the hummocks. Our results show that ecosystem respiration was significantly lower from hummocks than at the control site in the growing season. The results on the impact of zokors on greenhouse gas emissions presented in this paper provide a useful reference to help properly manage not only this, but other litter-burrowing mammals at peatland sites.

AB Peatlands are important ecosystems for understanding global methane (CH4) and greenhouse gas budgets. We evaluated the CH4 emissions from a cool temperate bog in northern Japan and their responses to environmental drivers based on four years of quasi-continuous measurements with the eddy covariance method. The bog acted as a 13 to 19 g C m(-2) yr(-1) CH4 source. High annual CH4 emissions outweighed the annual carbon dioxide (CO2) sink strength (-223 to -79 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), except in one year, resulting in a net greenhouse gas source at the annual timescale, although greater uncertainties in the annual CO2 budget (14%) than the CH4 budget (5%) caused uncertainties in the greenhouse gas budget. The seasonal variations in the CH4 fluxes were well explained by soil temperatures in the deep layers and the leaf area index of vascular plants. Pressure-driven CH4 emissions were measured at synoptic timescales, indicating high contributions of ebullition emissions. The episodic CH4 emissions during two typhoon events accounted for 5.1% of the annual fluxes in 2018. Nighttime CH4 emissions were greater than daytime emissions during the early growing season, possibly due to the hydrodynamic transport associated with soil temperature instability at night. The annual CH4 emissions were high when the dissolved oxygen concentration at 10 cm was low and the annual CO2 sink was great, suggesting the importance of anaerobic conditions and substrate availability, which facilitate CH4 production and restrict CH4 oxidation. The climate conditions in the study years were within the normal range; thus, further long-term measurements covering a wide range of climatic conditions will be required.

AB Peat bogs store up to a third of all terrestrial carbon on Earth(1), and are one of the largest natural sources of atmospheric methane(2). Anaerobic degradation of submerged Sphagnum species-mosses that are prevalent in peat bogs across the globe-produces significant quantities of methane in these systems. However, a study on peat mosses in the Netherlands revealed that a large fraction of this methane is consumed by aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria, known as methanotrophs(3); in return, the methanotrophs provide Sphagnum mosses with carbon(3). Here, we show that Sphagnum-associated methane oxidation occurs ubiquitously across the globe. We collected Sphagnum mosses from pools, lawns and hummocks in nine Sphagnum-dominated peatlands across the world, and measured their capacity to oxidize methane in a series of laboratory incubations. All mosses were capable of oxidizing methane. The rate of methane oxidation increased with temperature, and was most pronounced in submerged mosses, collected from peatland pools. According to DNA microarray analyses, the methanotrophic community responsible for methane oxidation was highly diverse. C-13 labelling revealed that methane-derived carbon was incorporated into plant lipids when mosses were submerged, indicative of a mutually beneficial symbiosis between mosses and methanotrophs. Our findings suggest that the interaction between methanotrophs and Sphagnum mosses may play a role in carbon recycling in waterlogged Sphagnum vegetation, potentially reducing methane emissions.

AB The paper presents results of CH4 emission measurements at peatland with the application of the dynamic chamber technique. The measurements were conducted in two types of chambers differing in shape, height, volume and technology used to assure their tightness. The study tested how the following factors: 1) forced chamber headspace mixing or its absence, 2) mistakes of the person conducting measurements, 3) improper application of linear technique for calculating CH4 fluxes, and 4) simulated air sampling typical for static chambers, influence the significance of errors and the underestimation rate of CH4 fluxes measured in situ. It was indicated that chamber headspace mixing allows estimating methane fluxes with a smaller error than in the case of measurements conducted without mixing, and CH4 fluxes in such conditions can be 47 to 58% higher (depending on the chamber type) than in a chamber without fans. Using dynamic chambers and a fast analyzer to measure methane fluxes allows shortening the methane measurement process to a few minutes. On the other hand, using static chambers for methane flux measurements may lead to 70% underestimation of the calculated flux.

AB Temperatures in the Arctic regions are rising, thawing permafrost and exposing previously stable soil organic carbon (OC) to decomposition. This can result in northern latitude soils, which have accumulated large amounts of OC potentially shifting from atmospheric C sinks to C sources with positive feedback on climate warming. In this paper, we estimate the annual net C gas balance (NCB) of the subarctic mire Stordalen, based on automatic chamber measurements of CO2 and total hydrocarbon (THC; CH4 and NMVOCs) exchange. We studied the dominant vegetation communities with different moisture and permafrost characteristics; a dry Palsa underlain by permafrost, an intermediate thaw site with Sphagnum spp. and a wet site with Eriophorum spp. where the soil thaws completely. Whole year accumulated fluxes of CO2 were estimated to 29.7, -35.3 and -34.9 gC m(-2) respectively for the Palsa, Sphagnum and Eriophorum sites (positive flux indicates an addition of C to the atmospheric pool). The corresponding annual THC emissions were 0.5, 6.2 and 31.8 gC m(-2) for the same sites. Therefore, the NCB for each of the sites was 30.2, -29.1 and -3.1 gC m(-2) respectively for the Palsa, Sphagnum and Eriophorum site. On average, the whole mire was a CO2 sink of 2.6 gC m(-2) and a THC source of 6.4 gC m(-2) over a year. Consequently, the mire was a net source of C to the atmosphere by 3.9 gC m(-2) (based on area weighted estimates for each of the three plant communities). Early and late snow season efflux of CO2 and THC emphasize the importance of winter measurements for complete annual C budgets. Decadal vegetation changes at Stordalen indicate that both the productivity and the THC emissions increased between 1970 and 2000. Considering the GWP(100) of CH4, the net radiative forcing on climate increased 21% over the same time. In conclusion, reduced C compounds in these environments have high importance for both the annual C balance and climate.

AB Methane is a major greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 25 times higher than carbon dioxide over a 100 year time horizon. Determining annual emission estimates, usually specified for different vegetation types under particular land use, requires the use of chamber measurements. These emission estimates may be strongly biased towards the lower or upper end by the spatial arrangement of measurement spots in the ecosystem. Here, we analyze the spatial variability of annual methane emission estimates based on non-steady state closed chamber measurements in pure and mixed stands of Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin ex Steud. in a restored coastal brackish fen. Annual methane emission estimates per measurement location vary largely between 46 and 1,329 kg ha(-1) a(-1) CH4 but they do not differ significantly between pure and mixed stands of P. australis. Mantel tests show a significant correlation of distances between spots and the variation in methane emission estimates (p < 0.05). Spatial correlation of water levels and annual methane emission estimates is not significant. Empirical variograms suggest that variance in annual methane emission estimates is not increasing with increasing spatial distance. However, spots that share larger distances may differ considerably in their annual methane emission estimates. At the same time, spots that share smaller distances-though these exceed the distances common to many closed chamber measurement setups-may differ less in their annual methane emission estimates. Thus, a huge part of the natural variation in annual methane emissions in a particular ecosystem or vegetation type may be missed when using the typical clustered arrangement of measurement locations in closed chamber studies. Therefore, we suggest that measurement locations should cover a wide spatial extent to improve the reliability of annual emission estimates per vegetation type and ecosystem, and that the number of measurement locations appropriate should be determined by pre-studies whenever possible.

AB Northern peatlands sequester carbon and emit methane, and thus have both cooling and warming impacts on the climate system through their influence on atmospheric burdens of CO2 and CH4. These competing impacts are usually compared by the global warming potential (GWP) methodology, which determines the equivalent CO2 annual emission that would have the same integrated radiative forcing impact over a chosen time horizon as the annual CH4 emission. We use a simple model of CH4 and CO2 pools in the atmosphere to extend this analysis to quantify the dynamics, over years to millennia, of the net radiative forcing impact of a peatland that continuously emits CH4 and sequesters C. We find that for observed ratios of CH4 emission to C sequestration (roughly 0.1-2 mol mol(-1)), the radiative forcing impact of a northern peatland begins, at peatland formation, as a net warming that peaks after about 50 years, remains a diminishing net warming for the next several hundred to several thousand years, depending on the rate of C sequestration, and thereafter is or will be an ever increasing net cooling impact. We then use the model to evaluate the radiative forcing impact of various changes in CH4 and/or CO2 emissions. In all cases, the impact of a change in CH4 emissions dominates the radiative forcing impact in the first few decades, and then the impact of the change in CO2 emissions slowly exerts its influence.

AB In North America, mulching of vacuum-harvested sites combined with blocking of the drainage system is widely used for peatland restoration to accelerate Sphagnum establishment. However, peat extraction in fen peatlands or exposure of deeper minerotrophic peat layers results in soil chemistry that is less suitable for re-establishment of Sphagnum moss. In this situation, restoration of plant species characteristic of minerotrophic peatlands is desirable to return the site to a carbon accumulating system. In these cases, it may be worthwhile to maintain spontaneously revegetating species as part of restoration if they provide desirable ecosystem functions. We studied the role of six spontaneously recolonizing vegetation communities for methane (CH4) emissions and pore water CH4 concentration for two growing seasons (2008 and 2009) at an abandoned minerotrophic peatland in southeastern Quebec. We then compared the results with bare peat and adjacent natural fen vegetation. Communities dominated by Eriophorum vaginatum, Carex aquatilis and Typha latifolia had CH4 flux an order of magnitude greater than other cutover vegetation types and natural sites. In contrast, Scirpus atrocinctus and Equisetum arvense had CH4 emission rates lower than natural hollow vegetation. We found seasonal average water table and vegetation volume had significant correlation with CH4 flux. Water table and soil temperature were significantly correlated with CH4 flux at plots where the water table was near or above the surface. Pore water CH4 concentration suggests that CH4 is being produced at the cutover peatland and that low measured fluxes likely result from substantial oxidation of CH4 in the unsaturated zone. Understanding ecosystem functions of spontaneously recolonizing species on cutover fens can be used to help make decisions about the inclusion of these communities for future restoration measures.

AB Wetlands are important sources of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). We provide an in situ study of CH4 dynamics in the permanently submerged soil of a Swiss alpine fen. Physico-chemical pore water analyses were combined with structural and microbiological analyses of soil cores at high vertical resolution down to 50 cm depth. Methanotrophs and methanogens were active throughout the depth profile, and highest abundance of active methanotrophs and methanogens [6.1 x 10(5) and 1.1 x 10(7) pmoA and mcrA transcripts (g soil)(-1), respectively] was detected in the uppermost 2 cm of the soil. Active methanotrophic communities in the near-surface zone, dominated by viable mosses, varied from the communities in the deeper zones, but further changes with depth were not pronounced. Apart from a distinct active methanogenic community in the uppermost sample, a decrease of acetoclastic Methanosaetaceae with depth was observed in concomitance with decreasing root surface area. Overall, root surface area correlated with mcrA transcript abundance and CH4 pore water concentrations, which peaked (137.1 mu M) at 10 to 15 cm depth. Our results suggest that stimulation of methanogenesis by root exudates of vascular plants had a stronger influence on CH4 dynamics than stimulation of CH4 oxidation by O-2 input.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial processes contribute largely to the greenhouse effect and climate change. One of these industries is the cement industry, which contributes around 8% of CO2 emissions caused by mankind. Two promising and interesting ways to reduce CO2 emission are the utilization of alternative cementitious materials and carbon capture and utilization through CO2 mineralization. In this study, peat-wood fly ashes from fluidized bed combustion were used as a construction material for mineral carbonation. A self hardening characteristic of this type of fly ash was utilized, and simultaneous carbonation and hydration reactions were studied. The study showed that fly ashes from the fluidized bed combustion of peat and wood could be used to capture and mineralize CO2 during hydration reactions. At the same time, CO2 could improve the strength of self-hardened fly ashes. One interesting future possibility is fly ash tile production at energy plants: fly ashes can be used to capture CO2 from flue gases, thus improving the strength of produced tiles.

AB Rewetting Rewetting can promote the ecological recovery of disturbed peatland ecosystems and may help to revert these ecosystems to carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks. However, rewetting of disturbed peatlands can also cause substantial emissions of methane (CH4) and possibly nitrous oxide (N2O). This study quantified summertime emissions of the three major long-lived greenhouse gases (GHGs) CO2, CH4 and N2O; from undisturbed, disturbed and rewetted soils in the Burns Bog Ecological Conservancy Area (BBECA), a 20 km(2) urban bog located in Delta, British Columbia, Canada. Four sites were chosen that represent different stages before or after ecological recovery in the BBECA: (i) a relatively undisturbed scrub pine / Sphagnum / low shrub ecosystem; (ii) a Rhynchospora alba / Sphagnum ecosystem that was disturbed by peat mining more than 65 years ago; (iii) a R. alba / Dulichium arundinaceum ecosystem that was disturbed by peat mining 50 years ago and rewetted five years ago; and (iv) a disturbed and rewetted surface with little vegetation cover that was cleared of vegetation 16 years ago and rewetted two years ago. The GHG fluxes from soils and ground vegetation were measured at all sites during June-August 2014, using a portable non-steady-state chamber system for CO2 and syringe sampling and laboratory analysis for CH4 and N2O fluxes. All four sites exhibited net GHG emissions into the atmosphere, dominated by CH4, which contributed 81-98 % of net CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions. Overall, the median CH4 flux for all measurements and sites was similar to 74 mg m(-2) day(-1) (similar to 30-410 mg m(-2) day(-1), 25th-75th percentiles). Fluxes in the rewetted (water-saturated) sedge ecosystem were highest, with a quarter of the values higher than 3,000 mg m(-2) day(-1) (median 78 mg m(-2) day(-1)). Exchange of CO2 due to photosynthesis and respiration was of secondary importance compared to soil CH4 emissions. Continuous CO2 flux measurements using the eddy covariance approach in the disturbed and rewetted R. alba / Sphagnum site showed that the entire ecosystem, which included tall vegetation, was a weak CO2 sink during the summer (average summertime CO2 uptake of 3.59 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)). No significant emission or uptake of N2O was observed. The results showed that CH4 emissions dominated the net GHG emissions in this disturbed bog at different stages of recovery.

AB Membrane inlet mass spectrometry was used to monitor dissolved gas concentrations and gas exchange rates Of CO2, CH4 and O-2 in peat cores from three very different locations in the Northern Hemisphere: Koppar (a) over circles Mire (Sweden), Hestur Site (Iceland), and Ellergower Moss (Scotland). With an increase of temperature gas solubilities are reduced, and due to additionally increased microbial activities higher gas emission rates for both CO2 and CH4 were observed. Experimental alterations of temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) also drastically effect daytime carbon dioxide emission rates as a result of changes in microbial and plant physiology. The impact of ebullition on gas emission rates was indicated by continuous measurements of gas concentrations in the headspace of Icelandic and Swedish cores using two different experimental setups. For methane, up to 2 of the total emission from cores from both 3 sites is released by ebullition. Total gas emission rate measurements in this study were similar for both experimental setups, and revealed gas effluxes comparable with field measurements for Scottish and Icelandic peat.

AB 1] Peatland drainage and peat extraction changes natural peatlands from a net carbon sink to that of a large net source due to increased respiration and the removal of carbon dioxide ( CO(2)) fixing vegetation. Restoration of these altered peatland ecosystems is being applied to reduce these carbon emissions. As peatland restoration is a new and emerging land-use management practice, the purpose of this research was to examine the impact of restoration on the methane ( CH(4)) component of the carbon cycle at the Bois-des-Bel peatland located near Riviere-du-Loup, Quebec from early May to mid October for several years. The seasonal CH(4) fluxes prior to restoration at an extracted ( cutover) and a restored peatland were not significantly different from each other or zero. However, three years postrestoration the seasonal CH(4) emissions at the restored site were 4.2 g m(-2) CH(4) season(-1), 4.6 times greater than the cutover site. Ponds and ditches at the restored site were seasonal CH(4) emission hot spots ( 0.3 and 2.9 g m(-2) CH(4) season(-1), respectively); however, emissions from herbaceous vegetation ( 1.0 g m(-2) CH(4) season(-1)) were the dominant source of CH(4) from the restored peatland due to its large areal extent. CH(4) fluxes from the Bois-des-Bel peatland represented 14% of the total CO(2)-equivalent losses from the site. This study demonstrates the importance of vegetation succession on peatland-atmosphere flux of CH(4).

AB Rapid changes in atmospheric methane (CH4), temperature and precipitation are documented by Greenland ice core data both for glacial times (the so called Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events) as well as for a cooling event in the early Holocene (the 8.2 kyr event). The onsets of D-O warm events are paralleled by abrupt increases in CH4 by up to 250 ppb in a few decades. Vice versa, the 8.2 kyr event is accompanied by an intermittent decrease in CH4 of about 80 ppb over 150 yr. The abrupt CH4 changes are thought to mainly originate from source emission variations in tropical and boreal wet ecosystems, but complex process oriented bottom-up model estimates of the changes in these ecosystems during rapid climate changes are still missing. Here we present simulations of CH4 emissions from northern peatlands with the LPJ-Bern dynamic global vegetation model. The model represents CH4 production and oxidation in soils and transport by ebullition, through plant aerenchyma, and by diffusion. Parameters are tuned to represent site emission data as well as inversion-based estimates of northern wetland emissions. The model is forced with climate input data from freshwater hosing experiments using the NCAR CSM1.4 climate model to simulate an abrupt cooling event. A concentration reduction of similar to 10 ppb is simulated per degree K change of mean northern hemispheric surface temperature in peatlands. Peatland emissions are equally sensitive to both changes in temperature and in precipitation. If simulated changes are taken as an analogy to the 8.2 kyr event, boreal peatland emissions alone could only explain 23% of the 80 ppb decline in atmospheric methane concentration. This points to a significant contribution to source changes from low latitude and tropical wetlands to this event.

AB South Patagonian peat bogs are little studied sources of methane (CH4). Since CH4 fluxes can vary greatly on a small scale of meters, high-quality maps are needed to accurately quantify CH4 fluxes from bogs. We used high-resolution color infrared (CIR) images captured by an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) to investigate potential uncertainties in total ecosystem CH4 fluxes introduced by the classification of the surface area. An object-based approach was used to classify vegetation both on species and microform level. We achieved an overall Kappa Index of Agreement (KIA) of 0.90 for the species- and 0.83 for the microform-level classification, respectively. CH4 fluxes were determined by closed chamber measurements on four predominant microforms of the studied bog. Both classification approaches were employed to up-scale CH4 closed chamber measurements in a total area of around 1.8 hectares. Including proportions of the surface area where no chamber measurements were conducted, we estimated a potential uncertainty in ecosystem CH4 fluxes introduced by the classification of the surface area. This potential uncertainty ranged from 14.2 mg center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1) to 26.8 mg center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1). Our results show that a simple classification with only few classes potentially leads to pronounced bias in total ecosystem CH4 fluxes when plot-scale fluxes are up-scaled.

AB On patterned peatlands, open water pools develop within a matrix of terrestrial vegetation ('ridges'). Regional patterns in the distribution of ridge-pool complexes suggest that the relative cover of these two surface types is controlled in part by climate wetness, but landscape topography must also be an important controlling factor. In this paper, a functional model that relates relative cover of ridges and pools to climate and surface gradient was developed and tested. The model was formulated in terms of a water budget, based on the differential effects of ridges and pools on losses by evapotranspiration and subsurface flow. It predicts a positive relationship between surface gradient and ridge proportion, with a linear effect related to water supply and ridge hydraulic conductivity, modified at high ridge proportion by differences in evapotranspiration between ridges and pools. The limit to patterned peatland distribution occurs where the surface is completely covered by ridges. The model may be sensitive or insensitive to climate differences between localities, depending on whether hydraulic characteristics of ridge peat co-vary with water supply. To distinguish between these alternative hypotheses, surface gradient and ridge proportion were surveyed along 20 transects in each of three localities in Scotland that differ threefold in net precipitation to pools. The results of the field survey served to reject the climate-sensitive hypothesis, but were consistent with the climate-insensitive hypothesis. Analysis of the residuals suggested that variation within localities was related more to topographic control of water supply than to ridge hydraulic conductivity or developmental stage. Hence, within this maritime climate region, the distribution of ridge-pool complexes and the relative abundance of pools are controlled mainly by topographic variables. Field surveys across both maritime and continental regions are required to confirm a subtle climatic effect that allows pools to occur on higher gradients in drier climates than in wetter climates. Further development and testing of the functional model will provide a stronger basis for assessing potential feedback between climate change, peatland surface structure and methane emission from pools.

AB Natural peatlands are known as an important source of methane (CH4). However, most peatlands in Central Europe were drained for forestry purposes in the past and some of them have been recently restored, both having a strong impact on CH4 emissions. The main aim of our study was to determine the effect of long-term drainage (a few decades) and hydrological restoration (3 years) on CH4 emissions, potential CH4 production and on the methanogenic Archaea community in different types of peatlands under various hydrological regimes. For this purpose, CH4 emissions together with biotic and abiotic variables were measured over three growing seasons, in vitro potential CH4 production was determined, and qPCR and DGGE fingerprinting were used for methanogenic community description in three ombrotrophic bogs (pristine, drained, restored) and two fens (pristine, drained) located in the umava National Park within the Bohemian Forest, Czech Republic. The highest CH4 emissions, CH4 potential production, and the highest diversity of the methanogenic community were observed in the pristine fen and bog. In the frame of interannual variability, a drought period seemed to play an important role in seasonal CH4 fluxes. Plant species composition together with water table seemed to be the most important factors controlling CH4 emission. Drainage led to a significant decrease in CH4 emissions, potential CH4 production, and the abundance and diversity of methanogens as compared to pristine sites. These post-drainage changes were more obvious in the fen site than on bog sites. However, none of the measured parameters showed significant changes during the 3 years after rewetting. We assume that the restored hydrology was not the main factor controlling CH4 emissions and other factors such as vegetation composition and input of available substrate for methanogenic community were more important. Therefore it appears that the period necessary for regeneration of CH4 emissions is the result of restoring all of these elementary factors together.

AB We studied vegetation dynamics at peatlands, differing in their climate, land use management history and vegetation community in Ireland and Finland over a two-year period. Our aim was to develop a species-specific method to be used to (1) describe the seasonal dynamics of green (photosynthetic) area (GA) of the vegetation and (2) incorporate these changes into CO2 exchange models. The extent of temporal and spatial variation between and within communities indicated the need for a two-step calculation approach for each community. Firstly, at biweekly to monthly intervals, GA of all species within a range of vascular plant communities was estimated by non-destructive field measurements. Gaussian or log-normal models were fitted to describe the seasonal dynamics of each species. Secondly, an estimate of community vascular green area (VGA) was obtained by summing the modelled daily GA of all species within the community. The highest values of VGA (2.1-6.0 m(2) m(-2)) occurred within the reed communities at the rewetted cutaway peatland in Ireland and the lowest at the ombrotrophic lawn communities in Finland (0.5-1.0 m(2) m(-2)). The relationship between light saturated gross photosynthesis (P (G)) and VGA was either linear or hyperbolic depending on the degree of self-shading that occurred within each community. The addition of the VGA term into P (G) models improved the explaining power of the model by 57.6, 24.5 and 23% within the Typha latifolia, Phalaris arundinacea and Eriophorum angustifolium/Carex rostrata communities, respectively. VGA proved useful in recording the seasonal development of a wide range of peatland vascular plant communities over geographically and climatically different regions.

AB Understanding and quantifying soil respiration and its component fluxes are necessary to model global carbon cycling in a changing climate as small changes in soil CO2 fluxes could have important implications for future climatic conditions. A soil respiration partitioning study was conducted in eight afforested peatland sites in south-west Ireland. Using trenched points, annual soil CO2 emissions, and the contributions of root and heterotrophic respiration as components of total soil respiration, were estimated. Nonlinear regression models were evaluated to determine the best predictive soil respiration model for each component flux, using soil temperature and water table level as explanatory variables. Temporal variation in soil CO2 efflux was driven by soil temperature at 10cm depth, with all treatment points also affected by water table level fluctuations. The effect of water table level on soil respiration was best accounted for by incorporating a water level Gaussian function into the soil-temperature-soil-respiration model. Mean root respiration was 44% of mean total soil respiration, varying between 1100 and 2049g CO2 m(-2) year(-1). Heterotrophic respiration was divided between peat respiration and litter respiration, which accounted for 35 and 21% of total soil respiration, respectively. While peat respiration varied between 774 and 1492g CO2 m(-2) year(-1), litter respiration varied between 514 and 1013g CO2 m(-2) year(-1). Although the extrapolation of these results to other sites should be done with caution, the empirical models developed for the entire dataset in this study are a useful tool to predict and simulate CO2 emissions in similar afforested peatlands (e.g. pine and spruce plantations) in temperate maritime climate conditions.

AB Northern peatlands have accumulated one third of the Earth's soil carbon stock since the last Ice Age. Rapid warming across northern biomes threatens to accelerate rates of peatland ecosystem respiration. Despite compensatory increases in net primary production, greater ecosystem respiration could signal the release of ancient, century- to millennia-old carbon from the peatland organic matter stock. Warming has already been shown to promote ancient peatland carbon release, but, despite the key role of vegetation in carbon dynamics, little is known about how plants influence the source of peatland ecosystem respiration. Here, we address this issue using insitu(14)C measurements of ecosystem respiration on an established peatland warming and vegetation manipulation experiment. Results show that warming of approximately 1 degrees C promotes respiration of ancient peatland carbon (up to 2100years old) when dwarf-shrubs or graminoids are present, an effect not observed when only bryophytes are present. We demonstrate that warming likely promotes ancient peatland carbon release via its control over organic inputs from vascular plants. Our findings suggest that dwarf-shrubs and graminoids prime microbial decomposition of previously locked-up' organic matter from potentially deep in the peat profile, facilitating liberation of ancient carbon as CO2. Furthermore, such plant-induced peat respiration could contribute up to 40% of ecosystem CO2 emissions. If consistent across other subarctic and arctic ecosystems, this represents a considerable fraction of ecosystem respiration that is currently not acknowledged by global carbon cycle models. Ultimately, greater contribution of ancient carbon to ecosystem respiration may signal the loss of a previously stable peatland carbon pool, creating potential feedbacks to future climate change.

AB The annual balance of CO2 was measured on a subarctic flark fen located in northern Finland (69degrees08'N, 27degrees17'E). Measurements were conducted using the micrometeorological eddy covariance method during the period from April 1998 to April 1999. Special emphasis was put on the importance of the wintertime CO2 balance as a component of the annual budget. The CO2 fluxes observed during the winter were relatively small (0.0055 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), but due to the long duration of the snow cover period, they play an important role in the annual balance of CO2. The efflux during the coldest periods, when soil surface temperatures fell below -10degreesC, was enabled by markedly higher peat temperatures (close to 0degreesC) in deeper layers. The typical nighttime respiration observed in summer was -0.10 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1). The net photosynthesis had a typical daytime peak value of about -0.20 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in July. Corresponding with the instantaneous CO2 fluxes, the highest daily sink balances of about -9 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) were observed in July, while the highest daily respiration balances of about 2.5 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) were observed before and after the sink period. The CO2 balance for the winter period (105 g CO2 m(-2)) was greater than the absolute value of the total annual balance (-68 g CO2 m(-2)), which shows the importance of the wintertime efflux. After taking into account estimates for CH4 efflux and carbon leaching, an annual carbon balance of -7+/-5 g C m(-2) was obtained for the fen.

AB Drained peatlands aremajor sources of CO2 to the atmosphere, yet the effects of land management and hydrological extremes have been little-studied at spatial scales relevant to agricultural enterprises. We measured fluxes of CO2 using the eddy covariance (EC) technique at two adjacent dairy farms on a drained peatland in Aotearoa New Zealand with remaining peat depths 5.5-8 m. One site (SD) had shallow surface drains and mean water table depth (WTD) -657 mm, while the other site (BD) had deep field border drains and mean WTD -838 mm. Net ecosystem CO2 production (NEP) was similar at the two sites when the soils were moist but diverged during late-summer drying, with site BD having 4.56 t C ha(-1) greater CO2 emission than site SD over the four-month dry period. Soil drying reduced gross primary production (GPP) at both sites, while ecosystem respiration (ER) was reduced at site SD but not at site BD. The low dry season respiration rates at site SD contributed to near-zero annual NEP, while higher respiration rates at site BD led to annual CO2 loss of -4.95 +/- 0.59 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). Accounting for other imports and exports of carbon, annual net ecosystem carbon balances were -2.23 and -8.47 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) at sites SD and BD, respectively. It is likely that the contrasting dry season respiration rates resulted from differences in soil physical properties affecting soil moisture vertical redistribution and availability to plants and microbes rather than from the relatively small differences in WTD. These differences could be caused by soil physical disturbances during pasture renewal or paddock recontouring, or time since initial drainage. Therefore, improved soil management might provide practical mitigation against excessive CO2 emissions during dry conditions, including droughts. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports chamber measurements of ecosystem respiration (ER) from reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) (RCG) cultivation made during 2004 and 2005 and respiration rates from an adjacent, bare peat extraction site. Annually, the RCG site released 1465 g in 2004 and 1968 g CO2 m(-2) in 2005. The peat extraction site, however, emitted 498 g in 2004 and 264 g CO2 m(-2) in 2005. Heterotrophic respiration accounted for about 45% of the RCG ER. Temperature explained 75-88% of the variation in 2005 RCG heterotrophic respiration. Autotrophic respiration was the dominant component of ER and it followed a similar seasonal pattern as the living (green) biomass. RCG heterotrophic respiration was related to soil temperature in interaction with soil volumetric water content and seasonal rainfall distribution. It explained 79 and 47% of the variation in the bare soil respiration from the peat extraction site during 2004 and 2005 snow free periods, respectively. Compared to other ecosystems, emissions from RCG were lower indicating that the RCG is a promising after use option in organic soils.

AB Fluxes of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOC) and methane were measured above a boreal fen. Vegetation on the fen is dominated by Sphagnum mosses and sedges. A relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) system with dynamic deadband was designed and constructed for the measurements. Methane, C-2-C-6 hydrocarbons and some halogenated hydrocarbons were analysed from the samples by gas chromatographs equipped with FID and ECD. A significant flux of isoprene and methane was detected during the growing seasons. Isoprene emission was found to follow the common isoprene emission algorithm. Average standard emission potential of isoprene was 680 mu g m(-2) h(-1). Fluxes of other non-methane hydrocarbons were below detection limit.

AB Northern peatlands contain a considerable share of the terrestrial carbon pool, which will be affected by future climatic variability. Using the static chamber technique, we investigated ecosystem respiration and soil respiration over two growing seasons (2012 and 2013) in a Carex lasiocarpa-dominated peatland in the Sanjiang Plain in China. We synchronously monitored the environmental factors controlling CO2 fluxes. Ecosystem respiration during these two growing seasons ranged from 33.3 to 506.7mg CO2-Cm (2) h (1). Through step-wise regression, variations in soil temperature at 10 cm depth alone explained 73.7% of the observed variance in log(10)(ER). The mean Q(10) values ranged from 2.1 to 2.9 depending on the choice of depth where soil temperature was measured. The Q(10) value at the 10cm depth (2.9) appears to be a good representation for herbaceous peatland in the Sanjiang Plain when applying field-estimation based Q(10) values to current terrestrial ecosystem models due to the most optimized regression coefficient (63.2%). Soil respiration amounted to 57% of ecosystem respiration and played a major role in peatland carbon balance in our study. Emphasis on ecosystem respiration from temperate peatlands in the Sanjiang Plain will improve our basic understanding of carbon exchange between peatland ecosystem and the atmosphere.

SO GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES

DT Article
AB Methane (CH4) dynamics in pore water, snow pore air, and surface emissions were investigated in a temperate poor fen in New Hampshire over several winters. Total snowfall and average air temperatures during winter months (defined as December, January, and February) were climatologic indicators of significant flux rates from this midlatitude poor fen. Average winter emissions, for the five winters ending in 1994-1995, were 20, 39, 53, 56, and 26 mg m(-2) d(-1) amounting to 2.0, 5.2, 6.6, 9.2, and 2.0% of the total annual fluxes, respectively. Totaling emissions over 5 years that represent low to average snowfall, winter accounted for 4.3% of emissions to the atmosphere. Winter flux rates were near 55 mg m(-2) d(-1) for years with average snowfall, and 25 mg m(-2) d(-1) for years with low snowfall. Concentrations of CH4 sampled in pore water immediately beneath the ice were highly variable (0 to 1.1 mM). The concentration magnitude and standard deviation increased toward the fen center and correlated with spatial variation in hydrology, peat texture, and peat depth. CH4 stores increased in the near-surface pore water as the ice cover formed. Seasonal CH4 buildup in deeper peat began near the end of the growing season, probably due to changing transport mechanisms and temperature effects on solubility. Stored CH4 in the 25- to 75-cm peat layer decreased by 2.7 g m(-2) between January and June 1995.

AB Minerotrophic sedge fens are common in sub-arctic regions and are a significant source of atmospheric methane (CH,), yet they have received less attention than other peatlands, such as boreal ombrotrophic bogs, which are smaller sources of CH4. At the process level, CH4 fluxes in sub-arctic systems are limited primarily by cold temperatures, and thus are sensitive to potential climate change. This study examined CH, dynamics in a temperate sedge-fen to determine controls on the spatial and temporal variability in CH4 fluxes and, therefore, how the biogeochemistry of CH4 in sedge-fen peatlands may respond to predicted changes in climate. We used flux chambers and laboratory peat incubations over a six to seven-year period (1994-2000) to study fluxes, pools, and potential production of CH4 in a peat-forming wetland in central New York State, USA. Results showed that precipitation (i.e., dry years and depth to water table) exerted an important control on annual and seasonal patterns of CH4 fluxes. Mean summer flux rates ranged from 2258 nmol m(-2) s(-1) in the wettest year to -934 nmol m(-2) s(-1) (net consumption) in the driest year. CH4 concentrations in the surface peat were as low as 0.01 mu atm and as high as 10 matm in the summer months depending on precipitation patterns. In contrast, CH4 concentrations were consistently two to three times greater in sub-surface than in surface peat, and pools persisted during dry years and were temporally less variable. Fluxes were only weakly associated with potential CH4 production rates, which showed little seasonal variation. In-vitro measurements of potential CH4 production did not sufficiently explain fluxes, suggesting a need for improved in-situ methods for measuring CH4 production. Site differences associated with different dominant vegetation had a significant effect on CH4 cycling in all years except the driest, suggesting sensitivity to vegetation changes. These results indicate that predicting responses of fen peatlands to environmental requires an improved understanding of the underlying microbial processes and mechanisms that control CH4 cycling.

AB High productivity temperate wetlands that accrete peat via belowground biomass (peatlands) may be managed for climate mitigation benefits due to their global distribution and notably negative emissions of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) through rapid storage of carbon (C) in anoxic soils. Net emissions of additional greenhouse gases (GHG)-methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)-are more difficult to predict and monitor due to fine-scale temporal and spatial variability, but can potentially reverse the climate mitigation benefits resulting from CO2 uptake. To support management decisions and modeling, we collected continuous 96 hour high frequency GHG flux data for CO2, CH4 and N2O at multiple scales-static chambers (1 Hz) and eddy covariance (10 Hz)-during peak productivity in a well-studied, impounded coastal peatland in California's Sacramento Delta with high annual rates of C fluxes, sequestering 2065 +/- 150 g CO2 m(-2) y(-1) and emitting 64.5 +/- 2.4 g CH4 m(-2) y(-1). Chambers (n = 6) showed strong spatial variability along a hydrologic gradient from inlet to interior plots. Daily (24 hour) net CO2 uptake (NEE) was highest near inlet locations and fell dramatically along the flowpath (-25 to -3.8 to + 2.64 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1)). In contrast, daily net CH4 flux increased along the flowpath (0.39 to 0.62 to 0.88 g CH4 m(-2) d(-1)), such that sites of high daily CO2 uptake were sites of low CH4 emission. Distributed, continuous chamber data exposed five novel insights, and at least two important datagaps for wetland GHG management, including: (1) increasing dominance of CH4 ebullition fluxes (15%-32% of total) along the flowpath and (2) net negative N2O flux across all sites as measured during a 4 day period of peak biomass (-1.7 mg N2O m(-2) d(-1); 0.51 g CO2 eq m(-2) d(-1)). The net negative emissions of re-established peat-accreting wetlands are notably high, but may be poorly estimated by models that do not consider within-wetland spatial variability due to water flowpaths.

AB The Mer Bleue peatland is a large ombrotrophic bog with hummock-lawn microtopography, poor fen sections and beaver ponds at the margin. Average growing-season (May-October) fluxes of methane (CH(4)) measured in 2002-2003 across the bog ranged from less than 5 mg m(-2) d(-1) in hummocks, to greater than 100 mg m(-2) d(-1) in lawns and ponds. The average position of the water table explained about half of the variation in the season average CH(4) fluxes, similar to that observed in many other peatlands in Canada and elsewhere. The flux varied most when the water table position ranged between -15 and -40 cm. To better establish the factors that influence this variability, we measured CH(4) flux at approximately weekly intervals from May to November for 5 years (2004-2008) at 12 collars representing the water table and vegetation variations typical of the peatland. Over the snow-free season, peat temperature is the dominant correlate and the difference among the collars' seasonal average CH(4) flux is partially dependent on water table position. A third important correlate on CH(4) flux is vegetation, particularly the presence of Eriophorum vaginatum, which increases CH(4) flux, as well as differences in the potential of the peat profile to produce and consume CH(4) under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The combination of peat temperature and water table position with vegetation cover was able to explain approximately 44% of the variation in daily CH(4) flux, based on 1097 individual measurements. There was considerable inter-annual variation in fluxes, associated with varying peat thermal and water table regimes in response to variations in weather, but also by variations in the water level in peripheral ponds, associated with beaver dam activity. Raised water level in the beaver ponds led to higher water tables and increased CH(4) emission in the peatland.

AB Landscape- and community-level CO2 measurements were made at a subarctic sedge fen near Churchill Manitoba during the 1997 growing season. Climatic conditions were warmer and drier than the 30-y normal. Landscape-scale micrometeorological measurements indicated that the wetland gained 49 g CO2 m(-2) during the growing season. Chamber-scale measurements from the main vegetation community types showed that small hummocks (Carex spp. sites) dominated the CO2 exchange, yielding an effective sealing factor of 70%. Scaled parameters of two algorithms describing photosynthesis and respiration for each community type show strong similarity to those derived at the landscape level. Scaling photosynthesis, respiration, and net ecosystem CO2 exchange from the community to landscape-level over the season is within the maximum probable error of each methodological approach and helps substantiate the 1997 CO2 budget. We explore the equilibrium response of net ecosystem CO2 exchange of this fen to climatic change by examining the feedback of water table position on vegetation distribution and nitrogen availability. Based on the effective scaling factors computed for each community type, we hypothesize that a small decrease in mean water table position could nearly triple the net uptake of CO2 at this wetland.

AB Eddy covariance measurements of methane (CH4) net flux were made in a boreal fen, typical of the most abundant peatlands in western Canada during May-September 2007. The objectives of this study were to determine: (i) the magnitude of diurnal and seasonal variation in CH4 net flux, (ii) the relationship between the temporally varying flux rates and associated changes in controlling biotic and abiotic factors, and (iii) the contribution of CH4 emission to the ecosystem growing season carbon budget. There was significant diurnal variation in CH4 emission during the peak of the growing season that was strongly correlated with associated changes in solar radiation, latent heat flux, air temperature and ecosystem conductance to water vapor. During days 181-215, nighttime average CH4 efflux was only 47% of the average midday values. The peak value for daily average CH4 emission rate was approximately 80 nmol m-2 s-1 (4.6 mg CH4 m-2 h-1), and seasonal variation in CH4 flux was strongly correlated with changes in soil temperature. Integrated over the entire measurement period [days 144-269 (late May-late September)], the total CH4 emission was 3.2 g CH4 m-2, which was quite low relative to other wetland ecosystems and to the simultaneous high rate of ecosystem net CO2 sequestration that was measured (18.1 mol CO2 m-2 or 217 g C m-2). We estimate that the negative radiative forcing (cooling) associated with net carbon storage over the life of the peatland (approximately 2200 years) was at least twice the value of positive radiative forcing (warming) caused by net CH4 emission over the last 50 years.

AB [1] Peatlands contain methanogenic archea responsible for generating significant amounts of free-phase biogenic gases (for example, methane and carbon dioxide), but considerable uncertainty still exists regarding the mechanisms of formation and spatial distribution of these gases within the soil matrix. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a new method to record noninvasively the evolution, spatial distribution, and emission patterns of biogenic gases in a peat soil. A peat block (0.022 m(3)) was extracted from a large freshwater peatland in Maine. The bulk dielectric permittivity (at 1.2 GHz) for multiple slices of the block was measured noninvasively (1) as temperature was increased 2 degrees C d(-1) from 5 degrees C to 21 degrees C, and (2) for a subsequent 2-month period during which temperature was held constant at 21 +/- 1 degrees C. Methane emissions at the surface and peat surface deformation were monitored concurrently using a portable methane detector and a grid of surface elevation rods, respectively. Our results demonstrate that (1) the measurement of electromagnetic wave traveltimes across a peat block offers a unique (and more accurate when compared to surface deformation measurements) way to monitor gasdynamics and spatial gas distribution within a peat block without any disturbance to the natural gas regime; (2) the ebullition under our experimental conditions seems to preferentially occur from the near-surface peat and shows some correspondence with changes in atmospheric pressure; and (3) the ebullition flux exhibits periodicity, suggesting that it may be predictable and quantifiable, which could assist climate modeling efforts. Our findings are consistent with previous studies based on gasdynamics in peat soils (including gas volumes and fluxes associated with biogenic gas ebullition).

AB Methane fluxes were measured on vegetated surfaces ( 2003) and pools ( 2004) of three peatlands (LG1-LG2-LG3) located 30, 100, and 200 km along a transect from the James Bay coast, in the La Grande Riviere watershed, James Bay lowland, Quebec, Canada. Fluxes were measured with static chambers at sites chosen to represent the biotypes characteristic of each peatland, from hummocks with a water table 35 cm below the surface to pools 100 cm deep. Average CH4 fluxes for the biotypes on vegetated surfaces sampled during summer 2003 ranged from 3.5 to 197 mg m(-2) d(-1), while summer 2004 average floating chamber pool fluxes ranged between 6.2 and 3165 mg CH4 m(2)(-) d(-1). Seasonal average daily CH4 fluxes on vegetated surface were strongly correlated with average water table depth, greater fluxes occurring where the water table was close to the surface, and with vegetation cover, particularly the aboveground biomass of sedges. Within the summer, increasing CH4 fluxes from vegetated surfaces were correlated with rising peat temperature. Pool fluxes from the LG1 and LG2 peatlands decreased with increasing pool depth, but not at LG3. Estimated growing season CH4 emissions for the three peatlands were of 44 +/- 21 ( standard error), 21 +/- 9.4 and 52 +/- 17 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) for the LG1, LG2, and LG3 peatlands, respectively. Estimated annual release of CH4 is 3.8 g m(-2) with the winter contributing to 13% of the overall emission, based on wintertime measurements at LG2.

AB In a mesocosm study, we investigated the effect of different restoration methods on methane (CH4) emissions from, and the global warming potential (GWP) of, blanket peat. The controlled laboratory study involved two distinct components: Experiment 1 focused on greenhouse gas exchanges from blocked drains (grips) and evaluated the effects of restoration method, water-level dynamics and climate on CH4 emissions and GWP. Experiment 2 assessed the role of plant functional type (PFT) on CH4 emissions from restored peat outside of the grip. A nine month meteorological simulation (April-December) was completed, testing five hypotheses across the two experiments. We found that the method of grip blocking/damming does make a difference with respect to CH4 emissions and GWP. Of the methods considered, damming with no infill between the dams is preferred to either of the methods involving infilling (heather bale and re-profiling). GWP of all within-grip restoration outcomes was positive (i.e., indicating a net warming effect), and was not influenced by climate or water-level regime. PFT influences CH4 emissions but not GWP in restored blanket bog. When considering radiative forcing, this finding suggests that it does not matter which PFT dominates a restored area. It is noted that the laboratory findings are, in some senses, preliminary because the experiments consider only a relatively short period immediately after restoration.

AB There is no clear consensus on how environmental and biotic factors control microbially-mediated methane production in wetlands, as well as emission of this important 'greenhouse gas' from wetlands into the atmosphere. To provide insight, I studied rates of methane production and emission into the atmosphere, as well as factors controlling those rates, along a toposequence from non-flooded to seasonally flooded in a coastal meadow and in a fen in Denmark. Methane production was estimated from anaerobic soil slurries while emission was estimated from static dux chambers. Methane emission into the atmosphere averaged 0.04 mu g C-CH, dm(-2) h(-1) in the coastal meadow and 1.9 mu g C-CH4 dm(-2) h(-1) in the fen. A comparison of potential CH4 production and CH4 emission into the atmosphere showed that in the coastal meadow, but not in the fen, emission increased when production increased during summer. Relationships between potential CH4 production and soil water content as well as soil temperature are discussed. Arrhenius plots indicated strikingly similar temperature responses of CH4 production in the two wetlands. Also, both wetlands showed different temperature responses in saturated soils (Q(10) = 3.1 and 3.6; E(h) = 79 and 84 kJ mol(-1)) compared to unsaturated soils (Q(10) = 8.1 and 8.7; E(h) = 138 and 142 kJ mol(-1)). My results suggest that different types of methanogens inhabit saturated and unsaturated soils in both a coastal meadow and a fen. Overall, the study indicates that CH4 production in wetlands and CH4 emission into the atmosphere from wetlands are controlled by a complex set of environmental and biotic factors which differ between wetlands.

AB We measured the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange with the eddy covariance (EC) method through three winters above a cultivated peat soil. During the first winter, the soil was ploughed, while for the next two winters it was grass-covered. On a weekly timescale, the emission was controlled by the soil temperature, whereas the vegetation had no clear impact. The deeper soil temperatures better correlated with the CO2 efflux, especially in frozen soil. The correlation with the air temperature was poor. After a mid-winter snowmelt, decreased CO2 efflux rates were temporarily detected, probably resulting from a lowered diffusion of CO) from the soil air into the atmosphere. Moderate soil-thaw CO pulses were observed in the springs of 2001 and 2003. CO2 emission rates measured with the EC method were found to be significantly lower as compared to those measured with the chamber method. The cumulative CO, emission between December and mid-March ranged from 80 to 178 m(-2) during three winters, correlating positively with air and soil temperatures and the number of snow-free days during that period. The projected increase in the air temperature related to global warming would boost the wintertime CO) efflux at our site by 30-200% (35-114 g m(-2)), depending on the selected emission scenario.

AB Peatland is a significant ecosystem that has accumulated one-third of the soil carbon in boreal regions. However, the net carbon balance, particularly with current carbon emissions, remains unclear. In this study, the annual ecosystem respiration and CH4 fluxes from a peatland located in Northeast China are reported. Ecosystem respiration fluxes from the shrub-moss-and Eriophorum-dominated communities in the peatland varied from 12 to 272 mg Cm-2 h(-2) during the snow-free season, and the Eriophorumdominated community emitted more CO2. Rates of ecosystem respiration were strongly regulated by temperature and water table depth. The CH4 fluxes emitted from the peatland throughout a year varied with the type of the vegetation community during the snow-free season. No distinct episodic CH4 efflux during the freeze-thaw cycles was observed from the shrub-moss-dominated community, whereas a subtle pulse of CH4 was found in the Eriophorum-dominated community. The annual ecosystem respiration and CH4 fluxes from the peatland were 356 and 1.51 g Cm-2 per year, respectively. The contributions of CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the snowy season to annual emissions were much lower than those found in other boreal peatlands, whereas 24% of the annual methane flux was emitted during the freeze-thaw cycles. The results highlight the importance of gaseous carbon efflux in the estimation of carbon flux from peatlands, as well as the contribution of carbon efflux during the snow-covered season.

AB Across Canada's boreal forest, linear disturbances, including cutlines such as seismic lines and roads, crisscross the landscape to facilitate resource exploration and extraction; many of these linear disturbances cross peatland ecosystems. Changes in tree canopy cover and the compression of the peat by heavy equipment alter local thermal, hydrological, and ecological conditions, likely changing carbon exchange on the disturbance, and possibly in the adjacent peatland. We measured bulk density, water table, soil temperature, plant cover, and CO2 and CH4 flux along triplicate transects crossing a winter road through a wooded fen near Peace River, Alberta, Canada. Sample plots were located 1, 5, and 10 m from the road on both sides with an additional three plots on the road. Productivity of the overstory trees, when present, was also determined. The winter road had higher bulk density, shallower water table, higher graminoid cover, and thawed earlier than the adjacent peatland. Tree productivity and CO2 flux varied between the plots, and there was no clear pattern in relation to distance from the road. The plots on the winter road acted as a greater CO2 sink and greater CH4 source compared to the adjacent peatland with plots on the winter road emitting on average (standard error) 479 (138) compared to 41 (10) mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) in the adjacent peatland. Considering both gases, global warming potential increased from 70 to 250 g CO(2)e m(-2) year(-1) in the undisturbed area to 2100 g CO(2)e m(-2) year(-1) on the winter road. Although carbon fluxes on any given cutline through peatland will vary depending on level of compaction, line width and vegetation community shifts, the large number of linear disturbances in Canada's boreal forest and slow recovery on peatland ecosites suggest they could represent an important anthropogenic greenhouse gas source.

AB Wood ash has been used to alleviate nutrient deficiencies of peat forests and to combat acidification of forest soils. Ash may change the activities of soil microbes, including those producing or consuming greenhouse gases, such as methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). We studied the effects of wood ash (loose wood ash originating from pulp mill or power plants) on the fluxes of CH4, N2O and CO2 in forests with mineral or peat soils in northern Finland. The ash doses were from 3 to 8 t ha(-1). Gas fluxes were measured with a closed chamber method from five recently fertilized experiments for 1 year after application of ash and from five long-term trials 14-50 years after application. Wood ash did not affect N2O gas fluxes. In the long-term experiments, wood ash increased the soil CO2 production and the CH4 uptake and lowered the CK4 emissions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background
   Peatland restoration can have several objectives, for example re-establishing the natural habitat, supporting unique biodiversity attributes or re-initiating key biogeochemical processes, which can ultimately lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Every restoration measure, however, is itself a disturbance to the ecosystem.
   Methods
   Here, we examine an ecosystem shift in a coastal fen at the southern Baltic Sea which was rewetted by flooding. The analyses are based on one year of bi-weekly closed chamber measurements of methane fluxes gathered at spots located in different vegetation stands. During measurement campaigns, we recorded data on water levels, peat temperatures, and chemical properties of peat water. In addition we analyzed the first 20 cm of peat before and after flooding for dry bulk density (DBD), content of organic matter and total amounts of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and other nutrients.
   Results
   Rewetting turned the site from a summer dry fen into a shallow lake with water levels up to 0.60 m. We observed a substantial die-back of vegetation, especially in stands of sedges (Carex acutiformis Ehrh). Concentrations of total organic carbon and nitrogen in the peat water, as well as dry bulk density and concentrations of C, N and S in the peat increased. In the first year after rewetting, the average annual exchange of methane amounted to 0.26 +/- 0.06 kg m(-2). This is equivalent to a 190-times increase in methane compared to pre-flooding conditions. Highest methane fluxes occurred in sedge stands which suffered from the heaviest die-back. None of the recorded environmental variables showed consistent relationships with the amounts of methane exchanged.
   Conclusions
   Our results suggest that rewetting projects should be monitored not only with regard to vegetation development but also with respect to biogeochemical conditions. Further, high methane emissions that likely occur directly after rewetting by flooding should be considered when forecasting the overall effect of rewetting on GHG exchange.

AB We studied carbon dynamics on various surface parts of a highly patterned fen, typical in northern Finland, to examine the importance of different microsites to the areal carbon fluxes. The studies were carried out in June-September 1995 on a mesotrophic flark fen (an aapa mire) in Kaamanen (69degrees08'N, 27degrees 17'E). Wet flarks, moist lawns and dry strings accounted for 60%, 10% and 30% of the surface area, respectively. A static chamber technique was applied to measure the CH, exchange, the instantaneous net ecosystem exchange (NEE, transparent chamber) and the ecosystem respiration (R(tot), opaque chamber) in several microsites. The static chamber results were compared with those obtained by the eddy covariance technique. The mean daytime areal net ecosystem CO(2) exchange rate measurement in conditions where photosynthesis was light saturated (PAR> 400 mumol m(-2) s(-1)) varied during the measurement period from -59 mg CO(2)-C m(-2)h(-1) (release) to 250 (uptake). The mean CH(4) emission during the measuring period was 78 mg CH(4)-C m(-2) d(-1) on the flarks., 68 mg on the lawn and 6.0 mg on the strings. The strings without shrubs (mainly Betula nana) were in general net sources of CO(2), even during the middle of the growing season, whereas the lawns, flarks and also strings growing B. nana showed a daytime net uptake of CO(2). A really integrated chamber results showed lower CO, and higher CH, fluxes than predicted from the eddy covariance measurements.

AB How methane (CH4) fluxes from alpine peatlands, especially during freeze-thaw cycles, affect the global CH4 budget is poorly understood. The present research combined the eddy covariance method, incubation experiments and high-throughput sequencing to observe CH4 flux from an alpine fen during thawing-freezing periods over a period of four years. The response of CH4 production potential and methanogenic archaea to climate change was analyzed. We found a relatively high mean annual cumulative CH4 emission of 37.7 g CH4-C m(-2). The dominant contributor to CH4 emission was the thawing period: warmer, longer thawing periods contributed 69.1-88.6% to the annual CH4 budget. Non-thawing periods also contributed, with shorter frozen-thawing periods accounting for up to 18.5% and shorter thawing-freezing periods accounting for up to 8.8%. Over the course of a year, emission peaked in the peak growing season and at onset of thawing and freezing. In contrast, emission did not vary substantially during the frozen period. Daily mean emission was highest during the thawing period and lowest during the frozen period. Diurnal patterns of CH4 emission were similar among the four periods, with peaks ranging from 12:00 to 18:00 and the lowest emission around 00:00. Water table and temperature were the dominant factors controlling CH4 emissions during different thawing-freezing periods. Our results suggest that CH4 emission from peatland will change substantially as CH4 production, microbial composition, and patterns of thawing-freezing cycles change with global warming. Therefore, frequent monitoring of CH4 fluxes in more peatlands and in situ monitoring of methanogenesis and related microbes are needed to provide a clear picture of CH4 fluxes and the thawing-freezing processes that affect them.

AB Sphagnum peatlands are important ecosystems in the methane cycle. Methane-oxidizing bacteria in these ecosystems serve as a methane filter and limit methane emissions. Yet little is known about the diversity and identity of the methanotrophs present in and on Sphagnum mosses of peatlands, and only a few isolates are known. The methanotrophic community in Sphagnum mosses, originating from a Dutch peat bog, was investigated using a pmoA microarray. A high biodiversity of both gamma- and alphaproteobacterial methanotrophs was found. With Sphagnum mosses as the inoculum, alpha-and gammaproteobacterial acidophilic methanotrophs were isolated using established and newly designed media. The 16S rRNA, pmoA, pxmA, and mmoX gene sequences showed that the alphaproteobacterial isolates belonged to the Methylocystis and Methylosinus genera. The Methylosinus species isolated are the first acid-tolerant members of this genus. Of the acidophilic gammaproteobacterial strains isolated, strain M5 was affiliated with the Methylomonas genus, and the other strain, M200, may represent a novel genus, most closely related to the genera Methylosoma and Methylovulum. So far, no acidophilic or acid-tolerant methanotrophs in the Gammaproteobacteria class are known. All strains showed the typical features of either type I or II methanotrophs and are, to the best of our knowledge, the first isolated (acidophilic or acid-tolerant) methanotrophs from Sphagnum mosses.

AB This is a study of the spatial and temporal variability of total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions from vegetation and soil at a subarctic mire, northern Sweden. THCs include methane (CH4) and nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), both of which are atmospherically important trace gases and constitute a significant proportion of the carbon exchange between biosphere and atmosphere. Reliable characterization of the magnitude and the dynamics of the THC fluxes from high latitude peatlands are important when considering to what extent trace gas emissions from such ecosystems may change and feed back on climate regulation as a result of warmer climate and melting permafrost. High frequency measurements of THC and carbon dioxide (CO2) were conducted during four sequential growing seasons in three localities representing the trophic range of plant communities at the mire. The magnitude of the THC flux followed the moisture gradient with increasing emissions from a dry Palsa site (2.2 +/- 0.1 mgC m(-2) d(-1)), to a wet intermediate melt feature with Sphagnum spp. (28 +/- 0.3 mgC m(-2) d(-1)) and highest emissions from a wet Eriophorum spp. site (122 +/- 1.4 mgC m(-2) d(-1)) (overall mean +/- 1 SE, n = 2254, 2231 and 2137). At the Palsa site, daytime THC flux was most strongly related to air temperature while daytime THC emissions at the Sphagnum site had a stronger relation to ground temperature. THC emissions at both the wet sites were correlated to net ecosystem exchange of CO2. An overall spatial correlation indicated that areas with highly productive vegetation communities also had high THC emission potential.

AB Dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria are ubiquitous in soils worldwide, possess the ability to transfer electrons outside of their cell membranes, and are capable of respiring with various metal oxides. Reduction of iron oxides is one of the more energetically favorable forms of anaerobic respiration, with a higher energy yield than both sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. As such, this process has significant implications for soil carbon balances, especially in the saturated, carbon-rich soils of the northern latitudes. However, the dynamics of these microbial processes within the context of the greater soil microbiome remain largely unstudied. Previously, we have demonstrated the capability of potentiostatically poised electrodes to mimic the redox potential of iron(III)- and humic acid-compounds and obtain a measure of metal-reducing respiration. Here, we extend this work by utilizing poised electrodes to provide an inexaustable electron acceptor for iron- and humic acid-reducing microbes, and by measuring the effects on both microbial community structure and greenhouse gas emissions. The application of both nonpoised and poised graphite electrodes in peat soils stimulated methane emissions by 15%-43% compared to soils without electrodes. Poised electrodes resulted in higher (13%-24%) methane emissions than the nonpoised electrodes. The stimulation of methane emissions for both nonpoised and poised electrodes correlated with the enrichment of proteobacteria, verrucomicrobia, and bacteroidetes. Here, we demonstrate a tool for precisely manipulating localized redox conditions in situ (via poised electrodes) and for connecting microbial community dynamics with larger ecosystem processes. This work provides a foundation for further studies examining the role of dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria in global biogeochemical cycles.

AB The application of stable isotopes is an approach to identify pathways of methanogenesis, methane (CH4) oxidation and transport in peatlands. We measured the stable C isotopic characteristics (delta C-13) of CH4 in peat profiles below hummocks, lawns and hollows of a Finnish mire to study the patterns of CH4 turnover. Porewater CH4 concentrations ([CH4]; at 0.5-2 m) increased with depth below all microforms. Emissions of CH4 from hummocks were the lowest, and increased with the increasing water-saturated zone, being similar to 10 times higher from hollows. Thus, the microtopography of the peatland did not affect the porewater [CH4] in the water-saturated part of the peat profile, but the CH4 emissions were affected due to differences in the oxidative potential of the microforms. There was a decrease in delta C-13-CH4 with depth below all microforms indicating dominance of CO2-reduction over acetate cleavage pathway of methanogenesis at deep peat layers. However, estimated potential portions of transported CH4 comprised 50%-70% of the delta C-13-CH4 enrichment on microforms at the 0.5-m depth, hereby masking the acetate cleavage pathway of methanogenesis. Stable C composition (delta C-13) of CH4 proved to be a suitable (but not sufficient) tool to differentiate between types of methanogenesis in continuously water-saturated layers below microforms of a peatland. Combined flux-based and multi-isotopic approaches are needed to better understand the CH4 turnover process.

AB Projected changes in climate could shift northern peatlands from their current status as net C sinks toward that of being net C sources by changing soil temperatures and hydrology. We assessed the importance of water table and soil temperature as controls over ecosystem respiration in a bog and sedge fen in northern Minnesota, USA, by means of a manipulative mesocosm experiment. Fifty-four intact monoliths were removed from a bog and a fen and installed in insulated tanks that permitted control of the water table and were heated by overhead infrared heaters. The experimental design was a fully crossed factorial combination of two communities, three water tables, and three heat levels. Fcosystem respiration as indicated by emission of CO2 and CH4, dissolved nutrient fluxes, and productivity were measured and summarized for each growing season from 1995 to 1997.
   Seasonal ecosystem respiration (ER) as indicated by CO2 emissions responded almost exclusively to soil temperature and did not differ between community types (similar to 630 g C/ m(2)) or with water table level. These results suggest that community type, within certain limits, will not be an important factor in predicting temperature-driven increases in ER.
   The response of CH4 flux to soil temperature and water table setting became progressively stronger in each succeeding growing season. Seasonal CH4 emissions were on average three times higher in the bog than in the fen mesocosms (21 vs. 7 g C/m(2)). Aboveground net primary productivity and dissolved N retention were also higher in the bog mesocosms. There were strong correlations between CH4 flux and N retention, but generally weak correlations between CH4 and plant primary production. The relatively lower CH4 emissions from the fen mesocosms appear to result mainly from higher rates of methanotrophy in the aerated zone, possibly reinforced by the effects of higher porewater N concentrations and lower primary productivity compared to the bogs.
   The results confirm the existence of strong environmental controls over ER and methanogenesis, which are modulated by complex interactions between plant community and soil nutrient dynamics. The differential responses of these ecosystem functions to climate change may complicate efforts to predict future changes in C dynamics in these important repositories of soil C.

AB This study develops a detailed methodology compatible to the Guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to assess the annual direct biogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) released from European agriculture. This approach relies on emission factors and regression equations derived from all long-term measurements in Europe available by the end of 2001. Applying the methodology, the biogenic GHG emissions from agriculture within the European Union (EU) and within its Member States are calculated for the period from 1975 to 1997 at a spatial resolution of regions or federal states (NUTS 1-2 level). As a result, in 1995, European agriculture emitted 0.84 +/- 0.19 Tg N2O, 8.1 +/- 2.0 Tg CH4 and 39 Tg +/- 25 CO2, which adds up to 470 +/- 80 Tg CO2-equivalents or 11% of the overall GHG emissions. At the EU level, these numbers are surprisingly close to the official inventory submitted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). But compared with the latter, the approach taken here leads to higher agricultural CH4 emissions in Austria and the Netherlands, at least 20% lower CH4 emissions in Denmark, Germany, Greece, Spain and Sweden and higher N2O emissions in most EU Member States. In countries with-even small-areas of farmed organic soils, CO2 emitted from peat oxidation can significantly contribute to the overall emissions. Hence, only the detailed approach adequately resolves regional and national specifics of agricultural conditions. It furthermore reduces the uncertainty in the emissions estimates to half of the one in inventories based on the IPCC Guidelines. Fair agreement with inverse atmospheric models was achieved. These results suggest that the methodology developed and applied here could serve as a significantly improved standard for official inventories of biogenic GHG emissions from EU Member States.

AB Boreal peatlands have significant emissions of non-methane biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). Climate warming is expected to affect these ecosystems both directly, with increasing temperature, and indirectly, through water table drawdown following increased evapotranspiration. We assessed the combined effect of warming and water table drawdown on the BVOC emissions from boreal peatland microcosms. We also assessed the treatment effects on the BVOC emissions from the peat soil after the 7-week long experiment. Emissions of isoprene, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, other reactive VOCs and other VOCs were sampled using a conventional chamber technique, collected on adsorbent and analyzed by GC-MS. Carbon emitted as BVOCs was less than 1% of the CO(2) uptake and up to 3% of CH(4) emission. Water table drawdown surpassed the direct warming effect and significantly decreased the emissions of all BVOC groups. Only isoprene emission was significantly increased by warming, parallel to the increased leaf number of the dominant sedge Eriophorum vaginatum. BVOC emissions from peat soil were higher under the control and warming treatments than water table drawdown, suggesting an increased activity of anaerobic microbial community. Our results suggest that boreal peatlands could have concomitant negative and positive radiative forcing effects on climate warming following the effect of water table drawdown. The observed decrease in CH(4) emission causes a negative radiative forcing while the increase in CO(2) emission and decrease in reactive BVOC emissions, which could reduce the cooling effect induced by the lower formation rate of secondary organic aerosols, both contribute to increased radiative forcing.

AB Cultivation of bioenergy crops has been suggested as a promising option for reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from arable organic soils (Histosols). Here, we report the annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) fluxes of CO2 as measured with a dynamic closed chamber method at a drained fen peatland grown with reed canary grass (RCG) and spring barley (SB) in a plot experiment (n=3 for each cropping system). The CO2 flux was partitioned into gross photosynthesis (GP) and ecosystem respiration (R-E). For the data analysis, simple yet useful GP and R-E models were developed which introduce plot-scale ratio vegetation index as an active vegetation proxy. The GP model captures the effect of temperature and vegetation status, and the R-E model estimates the proportion of foliar biomass dependent respiration (R-fb) in the total R-E. Annual R-E was 1887 +/- 7 (mean +/- standard error, n=3) and 1288 +/- 19g CO2-Cm-2 in RCG and SB plots, respectively, with R-fb accounting for 32 and 22% respectively. Total estimated annual GP was -1818 +/- 42 and -1329 +/- 66g CO2-Cm-2 in RCG and SB plots leading to a NEE of 69 +/- 36g CO2-C m(-2)yr(-1) in RCG plots (i.e., a weak net source) and -41 +/- 47g CO2-C m(-2)yr(-1) in SB plots (i.e., a weak net sink). Standard errors related to spatial variation were small (as shown above), but more significant uncertainties were related to the modelling approach for establishment of annual budgets. In conclusion, the bioenergy cropping system was not more favourable than the food cropping system when looking at the atmospheric CO2 emissions during cultivation. However, in a broader GHG life-cycle perspective, the lower fertilizer N input and the higher biomass yield in bioenergy cropping systems could be beneficial.

AB Increasing natural and anthropogenic deposition of nitrate (NO3-) and sulfate (Sail to peatlands may modify CH4 oxidation, CO2 and N2O production, thereby affecting the balance of greenhouse gases (GHG) globally. Among environmental factors controlling these biogeochemical processes, effects of peatland microrelief are poorly understood. Fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O were measured before and after incubation with NO3- and Sair-for peat samples collected from various microrelief positions,of a boreal oligotrophic mire in Eastern Finland. Soil was spiked with (CH4)-C-13 to understand the processes of CH4 oxidation, its microbial utilization and incorporation into soil organic matter (SOM). We hypothesized that the addition of NO3- and SO42- would 1) stimulate CO2 and N2O production (nutritional effect), but 2) decrease CH4 oxidation due to acceleration of other more energetically favorable processes (e.g., denitrification), and 3) these patterns should follow the naturally established aerobic zone of a microform type and decrease with depth.
   Microbial biomass (MB) at 50 cm below all microforms was 9-15 folds higher than in the topsoil. MB controlled the GHG dynamics and was related to specific depth-dependent environmental conditions, rather than oxygen availability. Indeed, production of CO2 and N2O, and oxidation potentials of CH4 revealed no clear linkage with the naturally established aeration zone of the peatland's microforms. Following NO3- and SO42- addition, production of CO2 decreased by 20-65% compared to the control, with the greatest reduction in CO2 emission occurring in the topsoil of hollows. In turn, CH4 oxidation was suppressed by 20-94% with NO3- addition at 50 cm in lawns and with both NO3- and SO42- at 50 cm in hollows. The N2O production was increased up to 180-240 times under NO3- treatment at 50 cm in hollows and lawns. In conclusion, human-induced deposition of NO3- and SO4- may suppress CO2 emissions from and CH4 oxidation by boreal oligotrophic mires especially under the conditions of deposition increase. Finally, the deposition of inorganic compounds is strongly important to be considered in the estimation of ecosystem C and N balances. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands drained for forestry have a high potential for CO2 emissions due to peat decomposition. Accurate estimates of either these emissions or soil carbon balances (Delta C-soil) on large areas are needed for national greenhouse gas inventories and as input for earth system models. The measurement of forest floor respiration (R-floor) or heterotrophic soil respiration (R-het) by portable chambers offers an affordable tool for extensive studies. So far, the reliability of respiration chamber based calculations of Delta C-soil, has not been tested and the prerequisites for their use have not been discussed. However, the method is being used in greenhouse gas inventories.
   In this study, we compared the results of two chamber based methods against a reference estimate based on eddy covariance measurements. In the first method, Delta C-soil was calculated by subtracting R-het from the litter input into the soil. In the second method, R floor was subtracted from the entire allocation of carbon (C) into the soil. A four-year detailed dataset of C dynamics of a drained peatland forest in southern Finland served as the test material.
   The R-het method produced results close to those of the reference method, but the results were sensitive to the choice of root turnover rates used in the estimation of litter input. The R-floor method resulted in a clear underestimation of soil C sink: the accurate estimation of the large photosynthesis and respiration fluxes needed for the calculation turned out to be difficult.
   In our opinion, the R-het method could be used to identify hot spots of forest soil CO2 emissions and for balance estimation for large areas. Further development of models for estimating the photosynthesis and respiration fluxes is needed for the application of the R-floor method. As the estimation of Delta C-soil by subtracting C output from C input is inherently sensitive to bias in the estimation of the input and output, the accuracy of both methods needs further testing with extensive datasets.

AB The mid-high latitude permafrost peatlands in the Northern Hemisphere is a major natural source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Ecosystem scale CH4 emissions from a typical permafrost peatland in the Great Hing'an Mountains were observed during the growing season of 2014 and 2015 using the open-path eddy covariance method. Relevant environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation were also collected. There was a clear diurnal variation in methane emissions in the second half of each growing season, with significantly higher emission rates in the wet sector of study area. The daily CH4 exchange ranged from 1.8 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) to 40.2 mg CH4 m(-2) d-1 in 2014 and ranged from 3.9 to 15.0 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) in 2015. There were no peaks of CH4 fluxes during the spring thawing period. However; large peaks of CH4 emission were found in the second half of both growing seasons. The CH4 emission after Jul 25(th) accounted for 77.9% of total growing season emission in 2014 and 85.9% in 2015. The total CH4 emission during the growing season of 2014 and 2015 was approximately 1.52 g CH4 m(-2) and 0.71 g CH4 m-2, respectively. CH4 fluxes during the growing seasons were significantly correlated with thawing depth (R-2 = 0.71, P < 0.01,) and soil temperatures (R-2 = 0.75, P < 0.01) at 40 cm depth. An empirical equation using these two major variables was modified to estimate growing season CH4 emissions in permafrost peatlands. Our multiyear observations indicate that the time-lagged volume of precipitation during the growing season is a key factor in interpreting locally inter-annual variations in CH4 emissions. Our results suggested that the low temperature in the deep soil layers effectively restricts methane production and emission rates; these conditions may create significant positive feedback under global climate change.

AB Global warming is expected to have greater impacts on northern peatlands in coming decade than most other ecosystems. Bacterial and methanogen communities in peatlands play a role in greenhouse gas emissions, and provide a feedback to global climate change. We investigated 3-degree warming effects on gas emissions (CO2 and CH4) and bacterial and methanogen communities in different depths of peat mire for 3 growing seasons. Warming doubled CO2 fluxes from the warming treatments compared to that from the control (P=0.08). Although CH4 fluxes were higher in the warming treatment, it was not a significant increase. Warming caused a shift in the composition of bacterial communities in the surface (1-3 cm, P<0.01) and middle layers (9-11 cm, P < 0.01), but not in the deep layer (17-19 cm). There were few changes in the diversity indices and quantity of bacterial communities due to the warming treatments. Warming significantly decreased the richness. Shannon diversity index, and quantity of methanogens. However, the composition was hardly related to temperature. The ratios of methanogens to bacteria in terms of gene copy numbers significantly decreased by a factor of 2-6 due to elevated temperature. The composition and diversity of bacteria and methanogens, respectively, were significantly related to soil depth. Temperature and soil depth interacted significantly on the bacterial diversity (P=0.01). The results suggest that warming is likely to influence the function and structure of microbial communities in peat lands. However, warming effects would be different with the type of microbial community and soil depth. Warming could favor bacterial communities over methanogens, which may induce changes in balance between CO2 and CH4 emissions from peatlands. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although methane (CH4) dynamics are known to differ at broad scales among peatland types and with climate, there is limited understanding of the variability associated with anaerobic carbon (C) cycling, and, the mechanisms that control that variability, among low pH, Sphagnum moss-dominated peatlands within a geographical region with similar climate. This is important because upscaling of CH4 emissions to regional and global scales often considers peatlands as a single, or at most two, ecosystem type(s). Here, we report the results from two studies exploring the controls of CH4 cycling in peatlands from the Upper Midwest (USA). Potential CH4 production and resultant CO2:CH4 ratios varied by several orders-of-magnitude among these soils. These differences were only partially explained by pH and fiber content (a measure of degree of decomposition in peat), suggesting other, more complicated controls may drive CH4 cycling in ombrotrophic peat soils. Based in part on the results from this survey, we more intensively examined CH4 dynamics in three bog-like, acidic, Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in northern Minnesota that differed in their degree of ombrotrophy. Net CH4 flux was lowest in the peatland with well-developed hummocks, and the isotopic composition of the CH4 along with methanotroph gene expression indicated a strong role for CH4 oxidation in controlling net CH4 flux. There were limited differences in porewater chemistry (CH4 and dissolved inorganic C concentrations) or microbial community composition among sites, and potential CH4 production was also similar among the sites. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that high variation in CH4 cycling in seemingly similar peatlands within a single geographical region is common. We suggest a one peatland represents all approach is inappropriate-even among Sphagnum-dominated peatlands-and caution must be used when extrapolating data from a single site to the landscape scale, even for outwardly very similar peatlands. Instead, the macroscale development of peatlands, and concomitantly their microtopography as expressed in the proportion of hummocks, hollows, lawns and pools, need to be considered as central controls over CH4 emissions.

AB The active layer thickness, CO2 emission, and contents of organic substances (including the total organic carbon, labile carbon, and the carbon of microbial biomass) in the soils of flat-topped peat mounds in the area of the Nadym Experimental Station in the north of Western Siberia (experimental site CALM R1) are characterized by considerable spatial variability. The low values of the CD2 emission are confined to the microelevations on the peatland surface. The high values of the emission (> 200 mg CO2/(m(2) h)) are typical of the soils with the highest content of the carbon of microbial biomass and the lowest content of the labile organic carbon. The soils of elevated flat-topped peat mounds statistically differ from the soils of waterlogged mires in the contents of total, labile, and microbial carbon and in the CO2 emission values. Though the soils of elevated flat-topped peat mounds are characterized by the high content of the carbon of microbial biomass (4260 +/- 880 mg D/kg soil), the CO2 emission from them is low (158 +/- 23 mg CO2/(m(2) h)), which is explained by the structure of microbial communities in the cryogenic soils and by the effect of specific hydrothermic conditions.

AB Methane fluxes from a shallow peatland lake (3450 m a.s.l., 1.6 km(2) in area, maximum depth <1 m) on eastern Tibetan Plateau were measured with floating chamber method during May to August, 2009. The overall average of methane emission rate during the study period was 34.71 +/- 29.15 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). The occurrence of ebullition among the overall methane flux from Lake Medo was about 74%. The average rate of ebullition was 32.45 +/- 28.31 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), which accounted for 93% of the overall average of methane emission. Significant seasonal variation was found for occurrence (P < 0.05) and rate (P < 0.01) of ebullition, both peaking synchronously in mid-summer. Both the occurrence and rate of ebullition were found positively related to sediment temperature but negatively related to lake water depth. The high methane production in the lake sediment was likely fueled by organic carbon loaded from surrounding peatlands to the lake. The shallowness of the water column could be another important favorable factor for methane-containing bubble formation in the sediment and their transportation to the atmosphere. The methane ebullition must have been enhanced by the low atmospheric pressure (ca. 672 hPa) in the high-altitude environment. For a better understanding on the mechanism of methane emission from alpine lakes, more lakes on the Tibetan Plateau should be studied in the future for their methane ebullition.

AB Previous studies have shown a correspondence between the abundance of particular plant species and methane flux. Here, we apply multivariate analyses, and weighted averaging, to assess the suitability of vegetation composition as a predictor of methane flux. We developed a functional classification of the vegetation, in terms of a number of plant traits expected to influence methane production and transport, and compared this with a purely taxonomic classification at species level and higher. We applied weighted averaging and indirect and direct ordination approaches to six sites in the United Kingdom, and found good relationships between methane flux and vegetation composition (classified both taxonomically and functionally). Plant species and functional groups also showed meaningful responses to management and experimental treatments. In addition to the United Kingdom, we applied the functional group classification across different geographical regions (Canada and the Netherlands) to assess the generality of the method. Again, the relationship appeared good at the site level, suggesting some general applicability of the functional classification. The method seems to have the potential for incorporation into large-scale (national) greenhouse gas accounting programmes (in relation to peatland condition/management) using vegetation mapping schemes. The results presented here strongly suggest that robust predictive models can be derived using plant species data (for use in national-scale studies). For trans-national-scale studies, where the taxonomic assemblage of vegetation differs widely between study sites, a functional classification of plant species data provides an appropriate basis for predictive models of methane flux.

AB The northern terrestrial net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) is contingent on inputs from vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) to offset the ecosystem respiration (R-eco) of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions, but an effective framework to monitor the regional Arctic NECB is lacking. We modified a terrestrial carbon flux (TCF) model developed for satellite remote sensing applications to evaluate wetland CO2 and CH4 fluxes over pan-Arctic eddy covariance (EC) flux tower sites. The TCF model estimates GPP, CO2 and CH4 emissions using in situ or remote sensing and reanalysis-based climate data as inputs. The TCF model simulations using in situ data explained >70% of the r(2) variability in the 8 day cumulative EC measured fluxes. Model simulations using coarser satellite (MODIS) and reanalysis (MERRA) Records accounted for approximately 69% and 75% of the respective r(2) variability in the tower CO2 and CH4 records, with corresponding RMSE uncertainties of <= 1.3 gCm(-2) d(-1) (CO2) and 18.2 mg Cm-2 d(-1) (CH4). Although the estimated annual CH4 emissions were small (<18 gCm(-2) yr(-1)) relative to R-eco (>180 gCm(-2) yr(-1)), they reduced the across-site NECB by 23% and contributed to a global warming potential of approximately 165 +/- 128 gCO(2)eqm(-2) yr(-1) when considered over a 100 year time span. This model evaluation indi-cates a strong potential for using the TCF model approach to document landscape-scale variability in CO2 and CH4 fluxes, and to estimate the NECB for northern peatland and tundra ecosystems.

AB Northern peatland water table position is tightly coupled to carbon (C) cycling dynamics and is predicted to change from shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns associated with global climate change. However, it is uncertain how long-term water table alterations will alter C dynamics in northern peatlands because most studies have focused on short-term water table manipulations. The goal of our study was to quantify the effect of long-term water table changes (similar to 80 years) on gaseous C fluxes in a peatland in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Chamber methods were utilized to measure ecosystem respiration (ER), gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and methane (CH4) fluxes in a peatland experiencing levee induced long-term water table drawdown and impoundment in relation to an unaltered site. Inundation raised water table levels by approximately similar to 10 cm and resulted in a decrease in ER and GPP, but an increase of CH4 emissions. Conversely, the drained sites, with water table levels similar to 15 cm lower, resulted in a significant increase in ER and GPP, but a decrease in CH4 emissions. However, NEE was not significantly different between the water table treatments. In summary, our data indicates that long-term water table drawdown and inundation was still altering peatland gaseous C fluxes, even after 80 years. In addition, many of the patterns we found were of similar magnitude to those measured in short-term studies, which indicates that short-term studies might be useful for predicting the direction and magnitude of future C changes in peatlands.

AB The use of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) as well as newer automated unmanned aerial vehicles is becoming a standard method in remote sensing studies requiring high spatial resolution (<1 m) and very precise temporal data to capture phenological events. In this study we use a low cost rotorcraft to map Eriophorum vaginatum at Mer Bleue, an ombrotrophic bog located east of Ottawa, ON, Canada. We focus on E. vaginatum because this sedge plays an important role in methane (CH4) gas exchange in peatlands. Using the remote controlled rotorcraft we were able to record, process, and mosaic 11.1 hectares of 4.5 cm spatial resolution imagery extracted from individual frames of video recordings (post georegistration RMSE 4.90 +/- 4.95 cm). Our results, based on a supervised classification (96% accuracy) of the red, green, blue image planes, indicate a total tussock cover of 2,417 m(2). Because the basal area of the plant is more relevant for calculating its contribution to the CH4 flux, the tussock area was related to the basal area from field data (R-2 = 0.88, p < 0.0001). Our final results indicate a total basal area of 1,786 +/- 62.8 m(2). Based on temporal measurements of CH4 flux from the peatland as a whole that vary over the growing season, we estimate the E. vaginatum contribution to range from 3.0% to 17.3% of that total. Overall, our low cost approach was an effective non-destructive way to derive E. vaginatum coverage and estimate CH4 exchange over the growing season.

AB Purpose The quantity and quality of soil organic matter (SOM) in the wetlands and peatlands are important for evaluating of the effects of environmental changes. This study's aim was to evaluate the change in the chemical properties of SOM and dissolved organic matter (DOM) during a constant temperature incubation of high-moor peat soil under two types of vegetation. Materials and methods Incubation of high-moor peat soils collected from marsh vegetation and dwarf bamboo was conducted for 108 days at each temperature of 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C. The chemical properties of alkaline extract and DOM in soil samples during incubation were analyzed by tetramethylammonium hydroxide thermochemolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TMAH-GC/MS) and fluorescence analysis. Results and discussion The cumulative CO2 emission from peat under dwarf bamboo was higher than that of peat under marsh vegetation. During incubation at 35 degrees C, plant and microbial residues in DOM extracted from dwarf bamboo soil were increased significantly at the early stages of culture. On the other hand, the components of DOM in the marsh vegetation soil sample did not significantly change between incubation at each temperature. The fluorescence spectra showed that protein-like fluorescent DOM contained in dwarf bamboo soil is consumed by microorganisms, which promotes leaching of humic-like fluorescent DOM and carbon mineralization during the incubation period at a higher temperature. Conclusions Compared with marsh vegetation soil, the DOM in dwarf bamboo soil is susceptible to temperature rises and can be a larger source of CO2 emissions. This study shows that evaluation of DOM properties in soil could be useful to assess the effect of climate change on soil environment.

AB The closed chamber technique has been widely employed to detect methane emissions, despite little being known about whether the absence or presence of light will impact the flux estimation. Here, we employed a laser greenhouse gas analyzer with an opaque-transparent chamber pair to measure the methane emission rate in a boreal peatland complex. Microtopography (i.e., hummocks and hollows) in natural and drained peatlands, and plant communities (i.e., grasses and shrubs) in a pasture converted from natural peatlands, were considered to cover the local heterogeneity. Our results indicated that opaque chambers (0.58-0.78 g CH4 m(-2) during the growing season) measured a significantly higher (similar to 2-3 times) methane emission at the hummocks than transparent chambers (similar to 0.24 g CH4 m(-2)); however, a similar phenomenon was not found at the hollows or at other measurement plots. Gross photosynthesis explained 44%-47% of the temporal variation of the 'artificial bias' (the difference in methane flux obtained by the opaque versus transparent chambers) at the hummocks. Additionally, both water table depth and surface soil moisture significantly explained spatial variations of methane emissions. Our study suggests that microtopography has a significant influence on the artificial bias in methane emission estimation and the artificial properties of a chamber (transparency/opacity) method can be vitally important in some cases (i.e., hummocks), and negligible in others (i.e., hollows). The observed connection between the photosynthesis process and the 'artificial bias' of closed chambers (opaque versus transparent) can be used to improve methane flux modeling. Separate parameterization schemes are needed for methane transportation under the presence or absence of light.

AB Peatlands are significant global methane (CH4) sources, but processes governing CH4 dynamics have been predominantly studied in the Northern Hemisphere. Southern hemispheric and tropical bogs can be dominated by cushion-forming vascular plants (e.g. Astelia pumila, Donatia fascicularis). These cushion bogs are found in many (mostly southern) parts of the world but could also serve as extreme examples for densely rooted northern hemispheric bogs dominated by rushes and sedges. We report highly variable summer CH4 emissions from different microforms in a Patagonian cushion bog as determined by chamber measurements. Driving biogeochemical processes were identified from pore water profiles and carbon isotopic signatures. Intensive root activity throughout a rhizosphere stretching over 2m in depth accompanied by molecular oxygen release created aerobic microsites in water-saturated peat, leading to a thorough CH4 oxidation (<0.003 mmol L-1 pore water CH4, enriched in delta C-13-CH4 by up to 10 %) and negligible emissions (0.09 +/- 0.16 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) from Astelia lawns. In sparsely or even non-rooted peat below adjacent pools pore water profile patterns similar to those obtained under Astelia lawns, which emitted very small amounts of CH4 (0.23 +/- 0.25 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), were found. Below the A. pumila rhizosphere pore water concentrations increased sharply to 0.40 +/- 0.25 mmol CH4 L-1 and CH4 was predominantly produced by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. A few Sphagnum lawns and - surprisingly - one lawn dominated by cushion-forming D. fascicularis were found to be local CH4 emission hotspots with up to 1.52 +/- 1.10 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1) presumably as root density and molecular oxygen release dropped below a certain threshold. The spatial distribution of root characteristics supposedly causing such a pronounced CH4 emission pattern was evaluated on a conceptual level aiming to exemplify scenarios in densely rooted bogs. We conclude that presence of cushion vegetation as a proxy for negligible CH4 emissions from cushion bogs needs to be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, overall ecosystem CH4 emissions at our study site were probably minute compared to bog ecosystems worldwide and widely decoupled from environmental controls due to intensive root activity of A. pumila, for example.

AB The Canadian horticultural peat industry generates carbon emissions through various methods of peat extraction, processing, and land-use changes. This study provides a carbon emissions analysis comparing the traditional vacuum harvest (VH) and block-cut (BC) extraction techniques to a new acrotelm transplant (AT) method that restores natural peatland function by preserving and replacing the surface layer vegetation as part of the extraction process. The relative global warming potential for each extraction method was determined by estimating carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and methane exchange for each phase of peat extraction, including emissions from land-use change and machinery fuel consumption. Preliminary findings, based on 1 y of measurements, indicate that the AT technique has the lowest annual carbon emissions compared to the VH and BC methods. Projected total carbon emissions from a 75-ha peatland after 50 y of extraction using the AT technique produced a sink of approximately 3300 t CO(2) equivalents (CO(2)-e). This represents a marked reduction in total carbon emissions estimated for the VH (19 000 t CO(2)-e) and BC (29 000 t CO(2)-e) extraction techniques. This analysis suggests that the AT method reestablishes peat accumulation and peatland carbon storage function more effectively than the VH and BC methods, which are associated with delayed restoration efforts. Consequently, the AT technique has the potential to greatly reduce the carbon footprint of the Canadian horticultural peat industry.

AB Arctic regions contain large amounts of stored soil carbon and comprise huge areas of discontinuous vegetation. The potential for feedback effects on possible changing climatic conditions through altered source/sink action for atmospheric CO2 is therefore an important issue in tundra regions. In this, study we investigate environmental controls on CO2 evolution rates in Arctic soils through observations along a Eurasian transect of tundra sites and comparative experiments in northern Sweden and northeast Greenland. Among factors potentially controlling decomposition rates in Eurasian wet and mesic tundra temperature and depth of the water table significantly influenced the CO2 efflux, while thaw depth, soil nitrogen, and organic matter concentrations explained very little of the variation in fluxes. The minor importance of the soil N status in controlling decomposition rates was confirmed in experiments in which N and P was added in a factorial manner at a subarctic heath and a high-Arctic drained fen. Phosphorus decreased the CO2 emissions, while the combined N and P treatment increased the emissions in the subarctic. These effects were not reproduced in the high Arctic. The results support most assumptions in current decomposition models on the soil climatic controls on decomposition rates in the Arctic.

AB Emission of CO2, CH4 and N2O from the snowpack is an important component of annual C and N budgets in wetland ecosystems in mid- and high-latitude. However, there is little information about greenhouse gas fluxes during the snow-covered season in wetlands in Northeast China. In the present study, we investigated the trace gas fluxes from a peatland and a marsh using the methods of concentration gradient and diffusion model during the snow-covered season of 2010/2011 in this region. Estimates of CO2 efflux from a peatland and a marsh during this period were 4.179 and 5.026 g C m(-2) season(-1), respectively. The seasonal release of CH4 from the peatland (0.009 g C m(-2) season(-1)) was much lower than that from the marsh (0.818 g C m(-2) season(-1)). Intriguingly, we observed that the peatland acted as sink for N2O, and the marsh as a source for N2O during the snow-covered season. For the peatland, snowpack such as snow density is important for CO2 and CH4 fluxes, while N2O flux was controlled by soil-snow interface temperature. In the marsh, however, soil temperature was the primary parameter regulating greenhouse gas fluxes. Our results suggest that in mid- and high-latitude regions, greenhouse gas fluxes during the snow-covered season is an important part of C and N cycles in seasonally snow-covered wetland ecosystems. The difference in greenhouse gas emission from both peatland and marsh suggests that wetland types should be considered when evaluating regional gas budgets.

AB It is important to understand the fate of carbon in boreal peatland soils in response to climate change because a substantial change in release of this carbon as CO2 and CH4 could influence the climate system. The goal of this research was to synthesize the results of a field water table manipulation experiment conducted in a boreal rich fen into a process-based model to understand how soil organic carbon (SOC) of the rich fen might respond to projected climate change. This model, the peatland version of the dynamic organic soil Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (peatland DOS-TEM), was calibrated with data collected during 2005-2011 from the control treatment of a boreal rich fen in the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX). The performance of the model was validated with the experimental data measured from the raised and lowered water-table treatments of APEX during the same period. The model was then applied to simulate future SOC dynamics of the rich fen control site under various CO2 emission scenarios. The results across these emissions scenarios suggest that the rate of SOC sequestration in the rich fen will increase between year 2012 and 2061 because the effects of warming increase heterotrophic respiration less than they increase carbon inputs via production. However, after 2061, the rate of SOC sequestration will be weakened and, as a result, the rich fen will likely become a carbon source to the atmosphere between 2062 and 2099. During this period, the effects of projected warming increase respiration so that it is greater than carbon inputs via production. Although changes in precipitation alone had relatively little effect on the dynamics of SOC, changes in precipitation did interact with warming to influence SOC dynamics for some climate scenarios.

AB Peatland restoration is seen as an effective contribution to help achieve the aims of the Paris Agreement because currently huge amounts of peatlands in Northern Central Europe are under unsustainable drainage-based land use. If net zero greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands shall be reached by 2050, restoration measures have to be done as soon as possible. However, rewetting drained peatlands that were under intensive grassland use frequently results in high methane (CH4) emissions, which is often seen as a counter-argument against rewetting. To find the source of high CH4 emissions after rewetting and to explore the best possible way of peatland restoration (i.e., low CH4 emissions after rewetting) under near-natural conditions, we installed a field trial in a drained bog in north-western Germany. The trial consists of seven plots (similar to 8 x 24 m(2)) representing the status quo-intensive grassland use- and six restoration approaches with combinations of rewetting either on the original surface or after topsoil removal (TSR), biomass harvesting or spreading Sphagnum spp. to initiate vegetation succession. On all seven plots we measured CH4 fluxes using closed chambers. In addition, we investigated CH4 production potential by incubating soil samples and determining methanogen abundance by quantitative PCR. Compared to rewetting on the original surface, CH4 emissions were reduced on TSR plots by factor 30 to 400. Spreading of Sphagnum spp. had only little effect on CH4 emissions during the first year of establishment. TSR also reduced CH4 production potential and methanogen abundance. Further, the response of CH4 fluxes to methanogen abundance was lower after TSR. This suggests that both reduction in labile substrate and in methanogen abundance contribute to near-zero CH4 emissions after TSR. These are the first field-scale results that demonstrate the efficiency of removing degraded topsoil to avoid high CH4 emissions after rewetting. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study uses a 12-year time series (2001-2012) of eddy covariance measurements to investigate the long-term net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) and inter-annual variations in relation to abiotic drivers in a boreal fen in northern Sweden. The peatland was a sink for atmospheric CO2 in each of the twelve study years with a 12-year average (+/- standard deviation) NEE of -58 +/- 21 g C m(-2) yr(-1). For ten out of twelve years, the cumulative annual NEE was within a range of -42 to -79 g C m(-2) yr(-1) suggesting a general state of resilience of NEE to moderate inter-annual climate variations. However, the annual NEE of -18 and -106 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2006 and 2008, respectively, diverged considerably from this common range. The lower annual CO2 uptake in 2006 was mainly due to late summer emissions related to an exceptional drop in water table level (WTL). A positive relationship (R-2 = 0.65) between pre-growing season (January to April) air temperature (Ta) and summer (June to July) gross ecosystem production (GEP) was observed. We suggest that enhanced GEP due to mild pre-growing season air temperature in combination with air temperature constraints on ecosystem respiration (ER) during the following cooler summer explained most of the greater net CO2 uptake in 2008. Differences in the annual and growing season means of other abiotic variables (e.g. radiation, vapor pressure deficit, precipitation) and growing season properties (i.e. start date, end date, length) were unable to explain the inter-annual variations of NEE. Overall, our findings suggest that this boreal fen acts as a persistent contemporary sink for atmospheric CO2 that is, however, susceptible to severe anomalies in WTL and pre-growing season air temperature associated with predicted changes in climate patterns for the boreal region.

AB Midlatitude treed bogs represent significant carbon (C) stocks and are highly sensitive to global climate change. In a dry continental treed bog, we compared three sites: control, recent (1-3 years; experimental) and older drained (10-13 years), with water levels at 38, 74 and 120 cm below the surface, respectively. At each site we measured carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and estimated tree root respiration (R-r; across hummock-hollow microtopography of the forest floor) and net primary production (NPP) of trees during the growing seasons (May to October) of 2011-2013. The CO2-C balance was calculated by adding the net CO2 exchange of the forest floor (NEff-R-r)to the NPP of the trees.
   From cooler and wetter 2011 to the driest and the warmest 2013, the control site was a CO2-C sink of 92, 70 and 76 g m(-2), the experimental site was a CO2-C source of 14, 57 and 135 g m(-2), and the drained site was a progressively smaller source of 26, 23 and 13 g CO2-C m(-2). The short-term drainage at the experimental site resulted in small changes in vegetation coverage and large net CO2 emissions at the microforms. In contrast, the longer-term drainage and deeper water level at the drained site resulted in the replacement of mosses with vascular plants (shrubs) on the hummocks and lichen in the hollows leading to the highest CO2 uptake at the drained hummocks and significant losses in the hollows. The tree NPP (including above-and below-ground growth and litter fall) in 2011 and 2012 was significantly higher at the drained site (92 and 83 g C m(-2)) than at the experimental (58 and 55 g C m(-2)) and control (52 and 46 g C m(-2)) sites.
   We also quantified the impact of climatic warming at all water table treatments by equipping additional plots with open-top chambers (OTCs) that caused a passive warming on average of similar to 1 degrees C and differential air warming of similar to 6 degrees C at midday full sun over the study years. Warming significantly enhanced shrub growth and the CO2 sink function of the drained hummocks (exceeding the cumulative respiration losses in hollows induced by the lowered water level x warming). There was an interaction of water level with warming across hummocks that resulted in the largest net CO2 uptake at the warmed drained hummocks. Thus in 2013, the warming treatment enhanced the sink function of the control site by 13 g m(-2), reduced the source function of the experimental by 10 g m(-2) and significantly enhanced the sink function of the drained site by 73 g m(-2). Therefore, drying and warming in continental bogs is expected to initially accelerate CO2-C losses via ecosystem respiration, but persistent drought and warming is expected to restore the peatland's original CO2-C sink function as a result of the shifts in vegetation composition and productivity between the microforms and increased NPP of trees over time.

AB Landfill methane emissions were measured continuously using the eddy covariance method from June to December 2010. The study site was located at the Bluff Road Landfill in Lincoln, Nebraska, USA. Our results show that landfill methane emissions strongly depended on changes in barometric pressure; rising barometric pressure suppressed the emission, while falling barometric pressure enhanced the emission, a phenomenon called barometric pumping. There was up to a 35-fold variation in day-to-day methane emissions due to changes in barometric pressure. Wavelet coherence analysis revealed a strong spectral coherency between variations of barometric pressure and methane emission at periodicities ranging from 1 day to 8 days. Power spectrum and ogive analysis showed that at least 10 days of continuous measurements was needed in order to capture 90% of the total variance in the methane emission time series at our landfill site. From our results, it is clear that point-in-time measurements taken at monthly or longer time intervals using techniques such as the trace plume method, the mass balance method, or the closed-chamber method will be subject to large variations in measured emission rates because of the barometric pumping phenomenon. Estimates of long-term integrated methane emissions from landfills based on such measurements could yield uncertainties, ranging from 28.8% underestimation to 32.3% overestimation. Our results demonstrate a need for continuous measurements to quantify annual total landfill emissions. This conclusion may apply to the study of methane emissions from wetlands, peatlands, lakes, and other environmental contexts where emissions are from porous media or ebullition. Other implications from the present study for hazard gas monitoring programs are also discussed.

AB Fluxes of the three main greenhouse gases (GHG) CO2, CH4 and N2O from peat and other soils with high organic carbon contents are strongly controlled by water table depth. Information about the spatial distribution of water level is thus a crucial input parameter when upscaling GHG emissions to large scales. Here, we investigate the potential of statistical modeling for the regionalization of water levels in organic soils when data covers only a small fraction of the peatlands of the final map. Our study area is Germany. Phreatic water level data from 53 peatlands in Germany were compiled in a new data set comprising 1094 dip wells and 7155 years of data. For each dip well, numerous possible predictor variables were determined using nationally available data sources, which included information about land cover, ditch network, protected areas, topography, peatland characteristics and climatic boundary conditions. We applied boosted regression trees to identify dependencies between predictor variables and dip-well-specific long-term annual mean water level (WL) as well as a transformed form (WLt). The latter was obtained by assuming a hypothetical GHG transfer function and is linearly related to GHG emissions. Our results demonstrate that model calibration on WLt is superior. It increases the explained variance of the water level in the sensitive range for GHG emissions and avoids model bias in subsequent GHG upscaling. The final model explained 45% of WLt variance and was built on nine predictor variables that are based on information about land cover, peatland characteristics, drainage network, topography and climatic boundary conditions. Their individual effects on WLt and the observed parameter interactions provide insight into natural and anthropogenic boundary conditions that control water levels in organic soils. Our study also demonstrates that a large fraction of the observed WLt variance cannot be explained by nationally available predictor variables and that predictors with stronger WLt indication, relying, for example, on detailed water management maps and remote sensing products, are needed to substantially improve model predictive performance.

AB Natural wetlands are the single largest source of atmospheric methane (CH4). Both a changed climate and deposition of anthropogenic nitrogen and sulfur can alter the production and oxidation of CH4 respectively and thereby also CH4 exchange. We used a long-term (12 years) factorial field experiment in a boreal oligotrophic mire to evaluate the effects of greenhouse cover and addition of ammonium nitrate and sodium sulfate on the production and oxidation of CH4 by applying laboratory incubations of samples from five depths in the mire. The rates of CH4 production were measured without amendments and after the addition of either glucose or sulfate. Twelve years of increased nitrogen deposition has changed the mire from a Sphagnum-dominated plant community to one dominated by sedges and dwarf shrubs. The deposition of nitrogen to the field plots caused increased production of CH4 in incubations without amendments (34%), and also after amendments with glucose (40%) or sulfate (42%). This indicates increased substrate availability (without amendments) but also a greater abundance of methanogens (glucose amendment). The greenhouse cover caused a decrease in CH4 production in incubations without amendments (34%), after glucose amendment (20%) and after sulfate amendment (31%). These responses indicate decreased substrate availability (without amendment) accompanied by the reduced abundance of methanogens (glucose amendment). The field application of sulfur had no effect on CH4 production at the depth where maximal CH4 production occurred. Closer to the mire surface, however, the rate of CH4 production was significantly reduced by 32-45%. These results suggest that the deposition of sulfate has altered the vertical distribution of methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria. The oxidation of CH4 was not significantly affected by any of the long-term field treatments.

AB Increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO,) in the atmosphere or continuous nitrogen (N) deposition might alter the carbon (C) cycle in boreal mires and thus have significant impacts on the development of climate change. The atmospheric impact of the C cycle in mires is twofold: C accumulation attenuates and CH4 release strengthens the natural greenhouse effect. We studied the effects of an increased supply of CO2 or NH4NO3 on the vegetation and annual CO2 exchange in lawns of a boreal oligotrophic mire in eastern Finland over a 2-year period. Ten study plots were enclosed with mini-FACE (Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment) rings. Five plots were vented with CO2-enriched air (target 560 ppmv), while their controls were vented with ambient air; five plots were sprayed with NH4NO3, corresponding to a cumulative addition of 3 g N M-2 a(-1), while their controls were sprayed with distilled water only. A raised NH4NO3 supply seemed to affect the composition of the moss layer. Raised CO2 did not affect the vegetation, but gross photosynthesis increased significantly. The change in net CO2 exchange depended on the annual weather conditions. Our results suggest that C accumulation may increase in wet years and compensate for the warming effect caused by the increase in CH4 release from this mire. In contrast, a relatively dry and warm growing period favors decomposition and can even make the CO2 balance negative. Along with the increased CH4 release under raised CO2 the decreased C accumulation then increases the radiative forcing of boreal mires.

AB Fluxes of CO2 and CH4 were determined by a static chamber technique at eight drained swamp peatland sites, with crop and forest covers. Over a 6-month period (May - October, 1991), CH4 fluxes ranged from -5 to 7 mg CH4 m-2 d-1 and were not correlated with either soil temperature or water table position. Integrated seasonal emissions were -0.40 to 0.04 g CH4 m2 over 147 days; the sites with a forest or grass cover were a small sink of CH4 whereas the sites with horticultural crops showed no significant flux. Laboratory incubations showed that the highest CH4 consumption rates (3 to 9 mug CH4 g-1 d-1) occurred in the least disturbed soils. The results, when compared with CH4 fluxes from nearby swamps which have been unaffected by drainage, suggest that drainage of temperate peatlands has reduced emissions of CH4 to the atmosphere by 0. 6 - 1 x 10(12) g CH4 yr-1. CO2 fluxes ranged f rom 0 to 16 g CO2 m-2 d-1 and were correlated with the seasonal pattern of temperature in the upper part of the soil profile. Integrated seasonal fluxes for the sites in which root respiration was an unimportant contribution were 0.6 - 0.8 kg CO2 m-2 over 181 days. Aerobic laboratory incubations revealed CO2 production rates of 0.2 - 1.4 mg CO2 g-1 d-1, an average of 5 times the rate under anaerobic conditions. Using bulk density and loss-on-ignition data, we found that the seasonal CO2 fluxes translate into surface lowering of the peat of about 2 mm yr-1, whereas the commonly observed lowering in these cultivated peatlands is 20 mm yr-1. These data suggest that processes other than direct oxidation, such as shrinkage and aeolian erosion, are the major contributor to the surface lowering of the peat.

AB This study presents a regional model showing the balance of carbon dioxide and methane fluxes in the Swedish county Jamtland, applying a Global Warming Potential 20-year time horizon (GWP20) to meet the Paris agreement horizon and regional policy goals. The results clearly show the necessity to take both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic emissions into consideration in analyses to be able to make proper priorities in future action strategies. The total annual impact from Jamtland calculated as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq) is an uptake of 2.4 Mton (19 ton per capita). Jamtland shows large annual uptakes in forests (12.7 Mton CO2), but also large emissions of methane (80 kton corresponding to 6.7 Mton CO2eq), mainly from lakes, mires and ruminants. Anthropogenic carbon Greenhous gas emissions are dominated by transportation, working machines and consumption (mainly imported indirect emissions).
   As a complement to GWP also the Absolute Global Temperature Change Potential (AGTP) as degree K response, is presented per sector and total for Jamtland County, for yearly emissions (as a pulse) and continuous emissions over 200 years. A yearly pulse from Jamtland gives a temperature response of about 0 K after 10 years and about -4 mu K (cooling effect) after about 50 years). Using both GWP and AGTP as indicators improves the possibilities to find ways how to optimize regional climate policies to reduce global warming until a specific year.
   Strategies and action plans should be developed focusing on the following:
   - Reduced regional transportation and consumption activity.
   - Increased (prioritized) use of renewable fuels for working machines in forestry and agriculture, as well as for heavy trucks.
   - Evaluate the potential to reduce emissions of methane from wetlands and mires.
   - Increase/optimize carbon dioxide assimilation in forests.

AB Drained peatlands are hotspots of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from agricultural soils. As a consequence of both drainage-induced mineralisation and anthropogenic mixing with mineral soils, large areas of former peatlands under agricultural use underwent a secondary transformation of the peat (e.g. formation of aggregates). These soils show contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) at the boundary between mineral and organic soils. However, the carbon (C) dynamics of such soils have rarely been studied so far. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the vulnerability of soil organic matter (SOM) to decomposition over the whole range of peat-derived soils under agriculture including very carbon rich mineral soils (76-526 g kg(-1) SOC). A total of 62 soil samples covering a broad range of soil and site characteristics were selected from the sample set of the German Agricultural Soil Inventory. Potential CO2 production was measured by aerobic incubation. Fen and bog peat samples were grouped into disturbance classes according to their soil properties. Specific basal respiration rates (SBR), i.e. CO2 fluxes per unit SOC, showed the highest values for the most disturbed samples for both fen peat (13.9 +/- 6.0 mu g CO2-C g SOC-1 h(-1)) and bog peat (10.9 +/- 4.7 mu g CO2-C g SOC-1 h(-1)). Respiration rates of bog peat increased more strongly with an increasing degree of disturbance than those of fen peat. Perhaps counterintuitively, SOM vulnerability to decomposition thus increased with an increasing degree of disturbance and a decreasing SOC content, indicating positive feedback mechanisms as soon as peat soils are disturbed by drainage. Furthermore, the variability of the SBR increased drastically with increasing degree of disturbance. The turnover of SOM in less disturbed peat samples tended to be higher in samples with higher nitrogen (N) content, higher pH value and lower C:N ratio, while plant-available phosphorus was important for the mineralisation of more severely disturbed peat. However, clear correlations between a single soil property and SBR could not be identified. The high potential of CO2 emissions from organic soils with a low SOC content implies that mixing organic soil with mineral soil does not seem to be a promising option for mitigating greenhouse emissions.

AB Rice residue management often leads to increased methane (CH4) emissions but the outcomes of edaphic and management factors are not always predictable. Rice residue can act as a substrate for CH4 production; however the role it plays in priming (mineralization) of soil organic matter (SUM) to release additional substrates for CH4 production are not well established. We anaerobically incubated a highly organic soil with C-13-enriched rice straw for 3 months to investigate its priming effect (PE) on SUM and source of C for CH4 production. Anaerobic decomposition of SUM was accompanied by iron (Fe) reduction with minimal CH4 production when straw was absent. Straw addition enhanced Fe reduction and increased CH4 production concurrently with a clear succession of microbial community structure and function assessed with phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling. The PE on CH4 production from SUM was strong and positive during the entire experiment. Overall, PE on SUM (CO2 plus CH4 production) was slightly positive at the end of the experiment, associated with only a 32% mineralization of the added straw-C (as CO2 plus CH4). Straw addition also released large amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from SOM. Our results suggest that straw addition effects on PE of SUM and CH4 production can last for a long period of time showing that straw will cause non-linear response in CH4 production and potentially result in significant losses of soil C as DOC by leaching or direct exports in histosols.

AB Plants can influence methane emissions from wetland ecosystems by altering its production, consumption and transport in the soil. The aim of this study was to investigate how eight vascular plant species from mesotrophic to eutrophic wetlands vary in their influence on CH4 emissions from peat cores, under low and high N supply. Additionally, we measured the production of low-molecular-weight organic acids (LOA) by the same species (also at low and high N supply), because LOA form a substrate for methanogenesis. There were considerable differences among species in their effects upon rates of CH4 emission. Six of the species (Eriophorum latifolium Hoppe, Potentilla palustris (L.) Scop., Anthoxanthum odoratum (L.) s. str., Carex rostrata Stokes, Carex elata All., Carex acutiformis Ehrh.) increased CH4 emissions up to five times compared to control peat cores without plants, whereas two species (Phalaris arundinacea L., Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud.) had no effect. There was a weak negative correlation between plant biomass and CH4 emission. N addition had no significant general effect upon CH4 emission. LOA production varied considerably among species, and tended to be highest for species from mesotrophic habitats. LOA production was stimulated by N addition. We conclude that some species from mesotrophic wetlands tend to cause higher CH4 emissions than species from eutrophic wetlands. This pattern, which contradicts what is often mentioned in literature, may be explained by the higher LOA production rates of species adapted to less productive habitats.

AB Large uncertainties exist in predicting responses of wetland methane (CH4) fluxes to future climate change. However, sources of the uncertainty have not been clearly identified despite the fact that methane production and emission processes have been extensively explored. In this study, we took advantage of manual CH4 flux measurements under ambient environment from 2011 to 2014 at the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experimental site and developed a data-informed process-based methane module. The module was incorporated into the Terrestrial ECOsystem (TECO) model before its parameters were constrained with multiple years of methane flux data for forecasting CH4 emission under five warming and two elevated CO2 treatments at SPRUCE. We found that 9 degrees C warming treatments significantly increased methane emission by approximately 400%, and elevated CO2 treatments stimulated methane emission by 10.4%-23.6% in comparison with ambient conditions. The relative contribution of plant-mediated transport to methane emission decreased from 96% at the control to 92% at the 9 degrees C warming, largely to compensate for an increase in ebullition. The uncertainty in plant-mediated transportation and ebullition increased with warming and contributed to the overall changes of emissions uncertainties. At the same time, our modeling results indicated a significant increase in the emitted CH4:CO2 ratio. This result, together with the larger warming potential of CH4, will lead to a strong positive feedback from terrestrial ecosystems to climate warming. The model-data fusion approach used in this study enabled parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for forecasting methane fluxes.
   Plain Language Summary Methane (CH4) has 45 times the sustained-flux global warming potential of CO2 over a 100-year scale, and it is directly responsible for approximately 20% of global warming since pre-industrial time. Wetlands are the single largest natural source of CH4 emission and there is major concern about potential feedbacks between global climate change and CH4 emissions from wetlands, as warming and atmospheric CO2 are known to affect CH4 emissions. However, extensive observed CH4 flux data have not been well used to constrain model predictions of CH4 emission in the future climate. Using a data-model fusion approach, we constrained parameters and quantified uncertainties of CH4 emission forecast. We found both warming and elevated air CO2 concentrations have a stimulating effect on CH4 emission. The uncertainty in plant-mediated transportation and ebullition increased under warming.

AB Vascular plant functions as controlling mechanisms of methane emissions were investigated at two contrasting habitat types at a subarctic peatland ecosystem in northern Sweden. One of the habitats was ombrotrophic (vegetation dominated by Eriophorum vaginatum and Carex rotundata), while the other was minerotrophic (vegetation dominated by Eriophorum angustifolium). Through shading manipulations we successfully reduced the gross photosynthetic rates of the vascular plant communities. At the ombrotrophic site a 25% reduction in gross photosynthesis lead to a concomitant 20% reduction in methane emission rates, indicating a strong substrate-based coupling between the vascular plant community and the methanogenic populations. At the minerotrophic site, methane emission rates were unaffected, although plant photosynthesis was reduced by almost 50%. However, the methane emission rates at the minerotrophic site were significantly correlated with the number of vascular plants. We conclude that at the minerotrophic site the vegetation influences methane emission rates by facilitating methane transportation between the soil and the atmosphere, while at the ombrotrophic site the relationship between the vascular plant community and methane emissions is mediated by substrate-based interactions regulated by plant photosynthetic activity.

AB Methane emissions were measured by a static chamber technique in a diverse peatland complex in the Northern Study Area (NSA) of the Boreal Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). Sampling areas represented a wide range of plant community and hydrochemical gradients (pH 3.9 - 7.0). Emissions were generally larger than those reported from other boreal wetland environments at similar latitude. Seasonal average fluxes from treed peatlands (includiug palsas) ranged from 0 to 20 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) compared with 92 to 380 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) in open graminoid bogs and fens (with maximum single fluxes up to 1355 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). Permafrost-related collapse scars had similarly high CH4 emissions, particularly in the lagg areas where continuous measurements of water table, peat surface elevation, and peat temperature showed that the peat surface adjusted to a falling water table in the abnormally dry 1994 season, maintaining warm, saturated conditions and high CH4 flux later into the season than nonfloating sites. A predictive model for CH4 flux and environmental variables was developed using multiple stepwise regression. A combined variable of mean seasonal peat temperature at the average position of the water table explained most of the spatial variability in log CH4 flux (r(2) = 0.64), with height above mean water table (HMWT), water chemistry (K-corr, pH, Ca), tree cover, and herbaceous plant cover explaining additional variance (r(2) = 0.81). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of combined vascular and bryophyte data with environmental variables showed that CH4 flux was negatively correlated with HMWT, the second axis of vegetation variability, and was only weakly correlated with chemistry, the first axis. Sedge and tree cover were correlated with high and low CH4 fluxes, respectively, while shrub cover was of less predictive value. Microtopographic groupings of hummocks and hollows were separated in terms of CH4 flux at the intermediate ranges of the moisture gradient. These data show that multivariate vegetation analyses may provide a useful framework for integrating the complex environmental controls on CH4 flux and extrapolating single point chamber measurements to the landscape scale using remote sensing.

AB I examined differences in the biogeochemical cycles of CH4 and CO2 (fluxes, concentrations, production, CH4 oxidation) in Typha latifolia wetlands on silty clay sediment versus organic peat soil in central New York State to determine whether variation in the amount of organic matter in sediment or soil, or plant production on sites with different organic matter content, affected variation in CH4 and CO2. I found very high temporal variation in CH4 within each site, precluding the detection of variation in CH4 as a function of sediment or soil organic matter content. In 1994, CH4 efflux from two peat sites to the atmosphere averaged 7 and 87 nmol m(-2) s(-1) compared to 89 and 408 nmol m(-2) s(-1) for two sediment sites. Mean CO2 efflux from the peat sites was 0.40 and 1.51 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) compared to 1.02 and 1.65 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for the sediment sites. I assessed the role of plant production by experimentally removing T. latifolia shoots from small plots: this lowered CH4 efflux from the sediment site by 85%, suggesting that plants foster CH4 production in low organic matter sediment, but CH4 efflux was 14-times greater following shoot removal on one peat site. Shoot removal had no effect on CO2 efflux. Variations in temperature, dissolved organic carbon, and pCH(4) in sediment or soil porewater explained the variation in CH4 efflux among the four study sites, whereas variation in net primary production explained the variation in CO2 efflux.

AB The fate of carbon stored in permafrost-zone peatlands represents a significant uncertainty in global climate modeling. Given that the breakdown of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is often a major pathway for decomposition in peatlands, knowledge of DOM reactivity under different permafrost regimes is critical for determining future climate feedbacks. To explore the effects of permafrost thaw and resultant plant succession on DOM reactivity, we used a combination of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), UV/Vis absorbance, and excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMS) to examine the DOM elemental composition and optical properties of 27 pore water samples gathered from various sites along a permafrost thaw sequence in Stordalen Mire, a thawing subarctic peatland in northern Sweden. The presence of dense Sphagnum moss, a feature that is dominant in the intermediate thaw stages, appeared to be the main driver of variation in DOM elemental composition and optical properties at Stordalen. Specifically, DOM from sites with Sphagnum had greater aromaticity, higher average molecular weights, and greater O/C, consistent with a higher abundance of phenolic compounds that likely inhibit decomposition. These compounds are released by Sphagnum and may accumulate due to inhibition of phenol oxidase activity by the acidic pH at these sites. In contrast, sites without Sphagnum, specifically fully-thawed rich fens, had more saturated, more reduced compounds, which were high in N and S. Optical properties at rich fens indicated the presence of microbially-derived DOM, consistent with the higher decomposition rates previously measured at these sites. These results indicate that Sphagnum acts as an inhibitor of rapid decomposition and CH4 release in thawing subarctic peatlands, consistent with lower rates of CO2 and CH4 production previously observed at these sites. However, this inhibitory effect may disappear if Sphagnum-dominated bogs transition to more waterlogged rich fens that contain very little to no living Sphagnum. Release of this inhibition allows for higher levels of microbial activity and potentially greater CH4 release, as has been observed in these fen sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Methane flux was measured using the micrometeorological eddy correlation technique during 62 days in mid-May through mid-October 1991 in a peatland ecosystem in north central Minnesota. Application of this technique allows measurement of spatially integrated fluxes. The distribution of methane flux consisted of a gradual pattern with several episodic emissions superimposed. The gradual (nonepisodic) pattern of methane flux (daytime average) exhibited an increase from 30-120 mg m-2 d-1 in late May to early July to 125-160 mg m-2 d-1 in mid-July to mid-August and then a decline to 100-35 mg m-2 d-1 in early September to mid-October. Peat temperature (at 0.1 m depth) and water table depth accounted for about 70% of the variance in the methane flux data. The episodic emissions were associated with drops in atmospheric pressure and a declining water table. Generally, the hourly values of daytime methane flux were fairly stable, perhaps with a slight depression during the midday. However, on days with episodic emissions, the daytime methane flux had a peak during the midafternoon, and its pattern appeared to be similar to those of the standard deviation of atmospheric pressure fluctuations and mean horizontal wind velocity. The ratio of soil CO2 to methane fluxes (during nonepisodic emission periods) increased with increasing water table depth in a manner similar to that observed in a laboratory study of peat columns from different wetland types in Quebec. The annual methane emission for this ecosystem was estimated to be about 16-19.5 g m-2 yr-1.

AB The combination of two well-established methods, of quadrocopter-borne air sampling and methane isotopic analyses, is applied to determine the source process of methane at different altitudes and to study mixing processes. A proof-of-concept study was performed to demonstrate the capabilities of quadrocopter air sampling for subsequently analysing the methane isotopic composition delta C-13 in the laboratory. The advantage of the system compared to classical sampling on the ground and at tall towers is the flexibility concerning sampling location, and in particular the flexible choice of sampling altitude, allowing the study of the layering and mixing of air masses with potentially different spatial origin of air masses and methane. Boundary layer mixing processes and the methane isotopic composition were studied at Polder Zarnekow in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania in the north-east of Germany, which has become a strong source of biogenically produced methane after rewetting the drained and degraded peatland. Methane fluxes are measured continuously at the site. They show high emissions from May to September, and a strong diurnal variability. For two case studies on 23 May and 5 September 2018, vertical profiles of temperature and humidity were recorded up to an altitude of 650 and 1000 m, respectively, during the morning transition. Air samples were taken at different altitudes and analysed in the laboratory for methane isotopic composition. The values showed a different isotopic composition in the vertical distribution during stable conditions in the morning (delta values of 51.5% below the temperature inversion at an altitude of 150m on 23 May 2018 and at an altitude of 50m on 5 September 2018, delta values of 50.1% above). After the onset of turbulent mixing, the isotopic composition was the same throughout the vertical column with a mean delta value of 49.9 +/- 0.45 %. The systematically more negative delta values occurred only as long as the nocturnal temperature inversion was present. During the September study, water samples were analysed as well for methane concentration and isotopic composition in order to provide a link between surface and atmosphere. The water samples reveal high variability on horizontal scales of a few tens of metres for this particular case. The airborne sampling system and consecutive analysis chain were shown to provide reliable and reproducible results for two samples obtained simultaneously. The method presents a powerful tool for distinguishing the source process of methane at different altitudes. The isotopic composition showed clearly depleted delta values directly above a biological methane source when vertical mixing was hampered by a temperature inversion, and different delta values above, where the air masses originate from a different footprint area. The vertical distribution of methane isotopic composition can serve as tracer for mixing processes of methane within the atmospheric boundary layer.

AB The effects of water table fluctuations and anoxia on methane emission and methane oxidation were studied in a freshwater marsh. Seasonal aerobic methane oxidation rates varied between 15% and 76% of the potential diffusive methane flux (diffusive flux in the absence of aerobic oxidation). On an annual basis, approximately 43% of the methane diffusing into the oxic zone was oxidized before reaching the atmosphere. The highest methane oxidation was observed when the water table was below the peat surface. This was confirmed in laboratory experiments where short-term decreases in water table levels increased methane oxidation but also net methane emission. Although methane emission was generally not observed during the winter, stems of soft rush (Juncus effusus) emitted methane when the marsh was ice covered, Indigenous methanotrophic bacteria from the wetland studied were relatively anoxia tolerant. Surface peat incubated under anoxic conditions maintained 30% of the initial methane oxidation capacity after 32 days of anoxia. Methanotrophs from anoxic peat initiated aerobic methane oxidation relatively quickly after oxygen addition (1-7 hours). These results were supported by culture experiments with the methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. This organism maintained a greater capacity for aerobic methane oxidation when starved under anoxic compared to oxic conditions. Anoxic incubation of M. trichosporium OB3b in the presence of sulfide (2 mM) and a low redox potential(-110 mV) did not decrease the capacity for methane oxidation relative to anoxic cultures incubated without sulfide. The results suggest that aerobic methane oxidation was a major regulator of seasonal methane emission from the investigated wetland. The observed water table fluctuations affected net methane oxidation presumably due to associated changes in oxygen gradients. However, changes from oxic to anoxic conditions in situ had relatively little effect on survival of the methanotrophic bacteria and thus on methane oxidation potential per se.

AB Surface waters associated with peatlands, supersaturated With CO2 and CH4 with respect to the atmosphere, act as important pathways linking a large and potentially unstable global repository of C to the atmosphere. Understanding the drivers and mechanisms which control C release from peatland systems to the atmosphere will contribute to better management and modelling of terrestrial C pools. We used non-dispersive infra-red (NDIR) CO2 sensors to continuously measure gas concentrations in a beaver pond at Mer Bleue peatland (Canada): measurements were made between July and August 2007. Concentrations of CO2 in the surface water (10 cm) reached 13 mg, C l(-1) (epCO(2) 72) and 26 mg C l(-1) (epCO(2) 133) at depth (60 cm). The study also showed large diurnal fluctuations in dissolved CO2 which ranged in amplitude from similar to 1.6 mg C l(-1) at 10 cm to similar to 0.2 mg C l(-1) at 60 cm depth. CH4 concentration and supersaturation (epCH(4)) measured using headspace analysis averaged 1-47 mg C l(-1) and 3252, respectively: diurnal cycling was also evident in CH4 concentrations. Mean estimated evasion rates of CO2 and CH4 over file summer period were 44.92 +/- 7.86 and 0.44 +/- 0.25 mu g C m(-2)s(-1), respectively. Open water at Mer Bleue is a significant summer hotspot for greenhouse gas emissions within the catchment. Our results suggest that CO2 concentrations during the Summer in beaver ponds at Mer Bleue are strongly influenced by biological processes within the water column involving aquatic plants and algae (in situ photosynthesis and respiration). In terms of carbon cycling soil-stream connectivity at this time of, Year is therefore relatively weak. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Methane (CH4) emissions from soils, representing the consequence of CH4 production, CH4 consumption and CH4 transport, are poorly characterised and show a large spatial variability. This study aimed to assess the determinants of field-scale spatial variability of CH4 emissions from wet grasslands on peat soil. Mean CH4 emission rates of a three-year experiment at 18 plots distributed over three sites in the nature preserve "Nieuwkoopse Plassen" on pear soil in the Netherlands were related to CH4 production and CH4 consumption capacities of soil layers, and to soil and vegetation characteristics. Spatial variability of CH4 emissions and possible determining factors was high. Annual CH4 emissions ranged from 3 to 37 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1). Coefficients of variation (CV) of CH4 emissions were on average 37% among sites and 83% within sites. Most important determinants of spatial variability were CH4 production capacity (average: 211 ng CH4 g(-1) dry soil h(-1); CV: 131%) and aboveground biomass of sedges (Carex: spp.) (average: 0.45 g dm(-2); CV: 127%) (P < 0.01). Sedges may affect CH4 emissions by stimulating CH4 transport from anaerobic layers to the surface via their vascular system and/or by serving as substrate for methanogen. For extrapolation of CH4 emissions to larger areas, best results will be obtained by using factors that are easy to determine, like vegetation.

AB The ice-cover season and subsequent spring thaw are thought to be of particular importance for the biogeochemical cycle of northern lakes and wetlands. Yet the magnitude of their methane emissions during an entire cold season is uncertain due to scarce measurements. While wetlands are known to be the highest natural emitters of methane, emissions from northern lakes are an uncertain component of terrestrial carbon budgets. To evaluate the importance of methane emissions from a subarctic lake during winter and spring, surface methane fluxes were recorded with the eddy covariance method in a subarctic fen-type wetland and in an adjacent shallow lake, from freezeup to complete ice out. The fen was a steady emitter of methane throughout winter. While no detectable flux was observed from the ice-covered lake surface during winter, it was the largest methane source of the landscape in spring, with a cumulative release 1.7-fold higher than at the fen, accounting for 53% of annual lake emissions. The high temporal resolution of the measurements allowed making a direct link between breakdown of the temperature stratification after ice breakup and the highest release of methane from the lake surface. A sediment upwelling at the end of the thaw season likely contributed to these emissions. We suggest that, unlike wetlands, shallow seasonally ice-covered lakes can have their highest methane emission potential in the cold season, likely dominating the spring methane release of subarctic landscapes with high lake coverage.

AB The early anthropogenic hypothesis claims that millennia ago farming began to transform landscapes sufficiently to emit greenhouse gases and extend the natural warmth of the current interglaciation that had been initiated by orbital variations. Part of the debate over the hypothesis during the last dozen years has centered on determining the best orbital analog to the Holocene among prior interglaciations, all of which must have been natural (non-anthropogenic) in origin. Since 2009, dozens of papers have assembled physical geographic evidence that points to the kind of large early agricultural impacts posed by the early anthropogenic hypothesis. These new findings include: pollen and archaeological evidence of carbon dioxide (CO2)-emitting early forest clearance in Europe and China, along with archaeobotanical and archaeological evidence of methane (CH4)-emitting rice irrigation and livestock tending across southern Asia. In addition, mapping of C-14-dated peat deposits has revealed an important CO2 sink of C-12-enriched terrestrial carbon during the last 7000 years that countered the delta(CO2)-C-13 imprint of emissions from early deforestation. This viewpoint article provides a current perspective on this ongoing debate in the context of these recent findings. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Grazing-oriented drainage of alpine/boreal wetlands has been broadly implemented to meet the increasing demand for animal products. However, the annual methane (CH4) emissions from alpine fens degraded due to drainage for grazing have not been well characterized clue to a lack of year-round observations. In this study, the year-round CH4 fluxes from a degraded alpine fen that is typical in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) were measured. The temperature sensitivity of the CH4 emissions during the nongrowing season (NGS) was different between the microsites with and without CH4 uptake during the growing season (GS), showing apparent activation energy of 59-61 vs. 22-43 kJ mol(-1) (or variation folds induced by the 10-degree change (i.e., Q(10)): 2.61-2.74 vs. 1.38-1.91). The CH4 emissions amounted to 0.2-63.3 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (with 0.8 to 41.4 kg C ha(-1) and 0.9 to 21.9 kg C ha(-1) in the GS and NGS, respectively), which were significantly (P < 0.05) related to the distances to the drainage ditch or water tables across the six microsites. As a key factor, the water table determined the role of the CH4 emissions during freezing/thawing. For cool/cold/alpine wetlands with no CH4 uptake in the GS, a mean factor of 1.52 (within a range of 1.00-2.44 at the 95% confidence interval), corresponding to an NGS contribution of 34% (ranging from 0 to 59%), was recommended to upscale the GS emissions to annual totals. Degradation of the native peat marshes in the Zoige region (originally the largest area of alpine wetlands) due to intentional drainage has greatly reduced the quantities of CH4 emissions. Additional studies are still needed to minimize the large uncertainties in CH4 emissions estimates for the changes in alpine wetlands in this region and for the entire TP. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Terrestrial consumption of the potent greenhouse gas methane (CH4) is a critical aspect of the future climate, as CH4 concentrations in the atmosphere are projected to play an increasingly important role in global climate forcing. Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) has only recently been considered a relevant control on methane fluxes from terrestrial systems. We performed in vitro anoxic incubations of intact peat from Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska using stable isotope tracers. Our results showed an average potential AOM rate of 15.0 nmol cm(3) h(-1), surpassing the average rate of gross CH4 production (6.0 nmol cm(3) h(-1)). AOM and CH4 production rates were positively correlated. While CH4 production was insensitive to additions of Fe(III), there was a depth:Fe(III) interaction in the kinetic reaction rate constant for AOM, suggestive of stimulation by Fe(III), particularly in shallow soils (<10 cm). We estimate AOM would consume 25-34% of CH4 produced under ambient conditions. Soil genetic surveys showed phylogenetic links between soil microbes and known anaerobic methanotrophs in ANME groups 2 and 3. These results suggest a prevalent role of AOM to net CH4 fluxes from Arctic peatland ecosystems, and a probable link with Fe(III)-reduction.

AB Methane (CH4) is an important greenhouse gas that is produced in different subsurface environments. Its main biological sink, microbial CH4 oxidation, can be quantified in situ in the vadose zone using gas push-pull tests (GPPTs). This field method is based on the comparison of breakthrough curves of the reactant CH4 and a nonreactive tracer. Under diffusion-dominated transport conditions, previously employed noble gases are unsuitable as tracers to calculate rate constants for CH4 oxidation due to differing diffusion coefficients. Here, we show that by performing two consecutive GPPTs and coinjecting acetylene (C2H2) as an inhibitor of CH4 oxidation in the second test, the reactant CH4 can be used as a substitute tracer. Applying this procedure, apparent first-order rate constants for CH4 oxidation ranging from 0.38 to 0.82 h(-1) were obtained in the vadose zone of three hummocks in an alpine peat bog near Lucerne, Switzerland. Corresponding estimates of in situ rates ranged from 4 to 299 ng CH4 g dry weight(-1) h(-1). In all but one GPPT, strong stable carbon isotope fractionation due to diffusion masked isotope fractionation due to microbial oxidation. Therefore, stable carbon isotope fractionation is suitable only to a limited extent as an indicator of microbial CH4 oxidation during a GPPT with diffusion-dominated gas transport. In contrast, the presented procedure for the quantification of microbial CH4 oxidation using GPPTs can be applied without restrictions even in systems with high porosity. Furthermore, the presented method may be useful for quantifying other processes for which suitable inhibitors but no suitable tracers are available.

AB Natural wetlands are the single most important contributors of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Recent research has shown that the deposition of sulfate (SO42-) can substantially reduce the emission of this radiatively important gas from wetlands. However, the influence of temperature to resulating the extent of this effect is unclear. Peatlands also constitute an important store of sulfur (S), so understanding the effect of S deposition on S dynamics within this store is important if we are to understand the interaction. The effect of enhanced SO42- deposition on CH4 fluxes and S pools were investigated in peatland monoliths under controlled environment conditions. This enabled a close examination of effects at the onset of experimentally enhanced SO42- deposition while examining temperature effects on the interaction. Experimentally enhanced S deposition at rates as small as 15 kg SO42- -S ha(-1) year(-1) suppressed CH4 emissions by 30 %. There was no increased suppression at larger deposition rates of simulated acid rain. Temperature affected the suppressive effect of the simulated acid rain. At love temperatures (down to 5 degreesC). there was a greater proportional suppression than at higher temperatures (up to 20degreesC). Evidence suggests that populations of SO42- reducing bacteria do not respond as previously thought. to enhanced SO42- supply with a 'boom' followed by a 'bust' and less recalcitrant S pools (SO42- and Sdegrees) were depleted in the SO42- treated peat, indicating enhanced S turnover. A significant proportion of the SO42- from the treatment was taken up and stored as SO42- in vascular plants. placing this mechanism as a potentially important seasonal regulator of peatland SO42- availability.

TI Do we miss the hot spots? - The use of very high resolution aerial
   photographs to quantify carbon fluxes in peatlands
SO BIOGEOSCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID MICROSITES; FEN
AB Accurate determination of carbon balances in heterogeneous ecosystems often requires the extrapolation of point based measurements. The ground resolution (pixel size) of the extrapolation base, e.g. a land-cover map, might thus influence the calculated carbon balance, in particular if biogeochemical hot spots are small in size. In this paper, we test the effects of varying ground resolution on the calculated carbon balance of a boreal peatland consisting of hummocks (dry), lawns (intermediate) and flarks (wet surfaces). The generalizations in lower resolution imagery led to biased area estimates for individual micro-site types. While areas of lawns and hummocks were stable below a threshold resolution of similar to 60 cm, the maximum of the flark area was located at resolutions below 25 cm and was then decreasing with coarsening resolution. Using a resolution of 100 cm instead of 6 cm led to an overestimation of total CO2 uptake of the studied peatland area (approximately 14 600 m(2)) of similar to 5% and an underestimation of total CH4 emission of similar to 6%. To accurately determine the surface area of scattered and small-sized micro-site types in heterogeneous ecosystems (e.g. flarks in peatlands), a minimum ground resolution appears necessary. In our case this leads to a recommended resolution of 25 cm, which can be derived by conventional airborne imagery. The usage of high resolution imagery from commercial satellites, e.g. Quickbird, however, is likely to underestimate the surface area of biogeochemical hot spots. It is important to note that the observed resolution effect on the carbon balance estimates can be much stronger for other ecosystems than for the investigated peatland. In the investigated peatland the relative hot spot area of the flarks is very small and their hot spot characteristics with respect to CH4 and CO2 fluxes is rather modest.

AB Hydrological changes, particularly alterations in water table level, may largely overshadow the mole direct effects of global temperature increase upon carbon cycling in arctic and subarctic wetlands. Frozen cores (n=40) of intact soils and vegetation were collected from a bog near Fairbanks, Alaska, and fluxes of CO2, CH4, and CO in response to water table variation were studied under controlled conditions in the Duke University phytotron. Core microcosms thawed to a 20-cm depth over 30 days under a 20 hour photoperiod with a day/night temperature regime of 20/10 degrees C. After 30 days the water table in 20 microcosms was decreased from the soil surface to -15 cm and maintained at the soil surface in 20 control cores. Outward fluxes of CO2 (9-16 g m(-2) d(-1)) and CO (3-4 mg m(-2) d(-1)) were greatest during early thaw and decreased to near zero for both gases before the water table treatment started. Lower water table tripled CO2 flux to the atmosphere when compared with control cores. Carbon monoxide was emitted at low rates from high water table cores and consumed by low water table cores. Methane fluxes were low (<1 mg m(-2) d(-1)) in all cores during thaw. High water table cores increased CH4 flux to 8-9 mg m(-2) d(-1) over 70 days and remained high relative to the low water table cores (<0.74 mg m(-2) d(-1)). Although drying of wetland taiga soils may decrease CH4 emissions to the atmosphere, the associated increase in CO2 due to aerobic respiration will likely increase the global warming potential of gas emissions from these soils.

AB Sulfur cycling in peatlands may affect global CH4 emissions by suppression of methanogenesis through bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR). We sought evidence for anaerobic sulfur cycling in four peat mesocosms irrigated with sulfate at a loading of 0.8 and 3.3 g S m(-2) yr(-1). To this end we obtained concentration profiles of dissolved O-2, C, S, and Fe, and determined S-34/S-32 ratios of sulfate, reduced inorganic sulfur ( TRIS), and total sulfur. To estimate the importance of BSR for anaerobic respiration, peat was incubated with molybdate as inhibitor of BSR. In the mesocosms, pore water concentrations of dissolved sulfate and H2S adjusted to 5-20 mu mol L-1 and 0-9 mu mol L-1, respectively, whereas concentrations of CO2, CH4, and DOC reached millimolar levels. CO2 production was not explained by methanogenesis and net reduction of inorganic electron acceptors. In the shallow peat, H2S was produced and 34 S in sulfate enriched by 3.6 to 6%, indicating occurrence of BSR. Sulfate reducers also accounted for much of the metabolic activity. Addition of molybdate suppressed CO2 production by 20 to 50%. Deeper into the peat, the sulfate pool was apparently replenished from the peat matrix as sulfate became enriched in 32 S, likely stemming from TRIS or organic sulfur in the peat. Sulfur was thus anaerobically cycled between oxidized and reduced pools. An electron acceptor capable of driving this cycle could not be conclusively identified. Regardless of this uncertainty, the results suggest that anaerobic S cycling can maintain BSR and potentially contribute to low methane production in soils of ombrotrophic bogs.

AB The patterned microtopography of subarctic mires generates a variety of environmental conditions, and carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) dynamics vary spatially among different plant community types (PCTs). We studied the CO2 and CH4 exchange between a subarctic fen and the atmosphere at Kaamanen in northern Finland based on flux chamber and eddy covariance measurements in 2017-2018. We observed strong spatial variation in carbon dynamics between the four main PCTs studied, which were largely controlled by water table level and differences in vegetation composition. The ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary productivity (GPP) increased gradually from the wettest PCT to the drier ones, and both ER and GPP were larger for all PCTs during the warmer and drier growing season 2018. We estimated that in 2017 the growing season CO2 balances of the PCTs ranged from -20 g C m(-2) (Trichophorum tussock PCT) to 64 g C m(-2) (string margin PCT), while in 2018 all PCTs were small CO2 sources (10-22 g C m(-2)). We observed small growing season CH4 emissions (< 1 g C m -2 ) from the driest PCT, while the other three PCTs had significantly larger emissions (mean 7.9, range 5.6-10.1 g C m(-2)) during the two growing seasons. Compared to the annual CO2 balance (-8.5 +/- 4.0 g C m(-2)) of the fen in 2017, in 2018 the annual balance (-5.6 +/- 3.7 g C m(-2)) was affected by an earlier onset of photosynthesis in spring, which increased the CO2 sink, and a drought event during summer, which decreased the sink. The CH4 emissions were also affected by the drought. The annual CH4 balance of the fen was 7.3 +/- 0.2 g C m(-2) in 2017 and 6.2 +/- 0.1 g C m(-2) in 2018. Thus, the carbon balance of the fen was close to zero in both years. The PCTs that were adapted to drier conditions provided ecosystem-level resilience to carbon loss due to water level drawdown.

AB Aims This study assesses the relative effects of hydrology and colonization by vascular plants on belowground C and N mobilization, and emission of CO2 and CH4 in an extracted bog under restoration in Alberta (Canada). Methods A wet (high water table) and dry (low water table) area were identified at the site and plots with cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum) or bare peat were established in each area. Plant growth, peat and porewater dissolved C (DOC) and N (TDN), microbial biomass and the emissions of CO2 and CH4 were monitored at the plots throughout the growing season. Results The largest concentrations of DOC were measured in dry and bare sites. Lower E2:E3 ratios suggested a higher aromaticity of the DOC at these sites that were net sources of CO2 and CH4. The concentration of TDN was greater in plots with cottongrass and high water table, supporting a more abundant microbial biomass. Cottongrass dominated plots also had larger gas emissions as compared to bare plots even though they were net C sinks due to their high photosynthetic rates. Conclusion Maintaining a high water table is key to reducing peatland C losses. While vascular plant presence seems to prime the release of N and greenhouse gases, the inputs of C exceeded the losses and recovered the C sink function of the peatland ecosystem in the short term. Carbon inputs are maximized under high water table and plant presence.

AB A study (August 1990 to July 1991) of profiles of dissolved CH4 concentrations, diffusive flux of CH4, and CH4 production rates of 45 sites in the Lake Agassiz Peatlands in northern Minnesota shows that dissolved CH4 deep in the peat (> 1 m depth) mobilized easily to the vadose zone. During August 1990 the dissolved CH4 concentrations at some depths at some sites were supersaturated with respect to one atmosphere partial pressure of CH4. At one site (2.5 m depth) the concentration of dissolved CH4 in the peat pore-water was 140 mg L(-1). In July 1991, at no site did the concentration of dissolved CH4 in the peat pore water exceed 40 mg L(-1) in the peat profile. The average calculated diffusive flux of CH4 decreased from 95 to 45 mg m(-2) d(-1) between 1990 and 1991. Gaseous CH4 was more in evidence in 1990 than in 1991. In 1990, CH4 at many depths bubbled vigorously when pear pore water was sampled. At some sites there was sufficient pore pressure to eject slugs of water forcibly from piezometers. Similarly, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) consisting of H2CO3, CO2, HCO3- and CO32- decreased between the sampling times from an average for both bogs and fens in 1990 of 62 mg C L(-1) to 38 mg C L(-1) in 1991. A dynamic mechanism must exist which traps CH4 deep in the peat column allowing gaseous CH4 to build up, increasing dissolved CH4. Other times, CH4 passes freely from deep peat to the vadose zone. We suggest as a hypothesis that a confining layer of trapped CH4 bubbles forms at depth in the peat, trapping gaseous CH4. The duration of the ''bubble confining layer'' is uncertain. We propose two hypotheses. (1) The confining layer is usually present and deteriorates after a major climatic event such as a drought, or (2) the confining layer forms and collapses seasonally with seasonal variations in the water table elevation.

LA English
DT Article
AB Emissions of CH4 were measured by a static chamber technique (five chambers/site) at 23 sites in four fens near Schefferville, subarctic Quebec. At three intensively-monitored sites along a transect from fen margin to central and flooded sites, mean CH4 fluxes from June to August, 1989 were 65, 125, and 36 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Pore water CH4 concentrations in the peat profiles to a depth of l m averaged 125 to 200 M, with lower concentrations (generally <50 M) at 0.1 m. Total, depth-integrated storage of CH4 in the peat profiles ranged from 3.5 to 4.3 g m(-2). Although CH4 flux was only weakly correlated with either peat temperature at 0.1 m or water table position within each site, there was a strong association of flux and these variables among the three sites, indicating the value of ecological attributes in identifying patterns of CH4 flux. A pulse of CH4 was recorded at two of the three sites in mid-August, associated with a degassing of the peat profile, based on pore water CH4 concentrations. This pulse appeared to be initiated by the lowering of the water table by between 5 and 10 cm during a 3-week period of low rainfall and is estimated to have contributed 18 to 65% of the seasonal CH4 emission, depending on the location of the site. An estimate of the regional CH4 flux from 130 km(2) of the Schefferville area was based on CH4 flux measurements at 23 sites in the area, stratified by fen type (forested margin, margin, central, flooded, ridge, and pool). June to August regional CH4 flux was 18 mg m(-2) d(-1), for an area in which fen coverage was 29%. When extrapolated to the global scale, these results indicate that northern fens may contribute about 14 Tg yr(-1), somewhat lower than other recent estimates.

AB Methane (CH4) emissions were compared for an intensively and extensively managed agricultural area on peat soils in the Netherlands to evaluate the effect of reduced management on the CH4 balance. Chamber measurements (photoacoustic methods) for CH4 were performed for a period of three years in the contributing landscape elements in the research sites. Various factors influencing CH4 emissions were evaluated and temperature of water and soil was found to be the main driver in both sites. For upscaling of CH4 fluxes to landscape scale, regression models were used which were specific for each of the contributing landforms. Ditches and bordering edges were emission hotspots and emitted together between 60% and 70% of the total terrestrial CH4 emissions. Annual terrestrial CH4 fluxes were estimated to be 203 (+/- 48%), 162 (+/- 60%) and 146 (+/- 60%) kg CH4 ha(-1) and 157 (+/- 63%), 180 (+/- 54%) and 163 (+/- 59%) kg CH4 ha(-1) in the intensively managed site and extensively managed site, for 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively. About 70% of the CH4 was emitted in the summer period. Farm based emissions caused per year an additional 257 kg CH4 ha(-1) and 172 kg CH4 ha(-1) for the intensively managed site and extensively managed site, respectively. To further evaluate the effect of agricultural activity on the CH4 balance, the annual CH4 fluxes of the two managed sites were also compared to the emissions of a natural peat site with no management and high ground water levels. By comparing the terrestrial and additional farm based emissions of the three sites, we finally concluded that transformation of intensively managed agricultural land to nature development will lead to an increase in terrestrial CH4 emission, but will not by definition lead to a significant increase in CH4 emission when farm based emissions are included.

AB Although much attention in recent years has been devoted to methane (CH(4)) emissions from northern wetlands, measurement based data sets providing full annual budgets are still limited in number. This study was designed to help fill the gap of year-round measurements of CH(4) emissions from subarctic mires. We report continuous eddy correlation CH(4) flux measurements made during 2006 and 2007 over the Stordalen mire in subarctic Sweden (68 degrees 20'N, 19 degrees 03'E, altitude 351 m) using a cryocooled tunable diode laser. The landscape-scale CH(4) fluxes originated mainly from the permafrost free wet parts of the mire dominated by tall graminoid vegetation. The midseason average CH(4) emission mean was 6.2 +/- 2.6 mg m(-2) h(-1). A detailed footprint analysis indicates an additional strong influence on the flux by the nearby shallow Lake Villasjon (0.17 km(2), maximum depth 1.3 m). A stable bimodal distribution of wind flow from either the east or the west allowed separating the lake and mire vegetation signals. The midseason lake emission rates were as high as 12.3 +/- 3.3 mg m(-2) h(-1). Documented CH(4) fluxes are similar to results obtained by automatic chamber technique and higher than manual chamber measurements made in the wet minerotrophic section dominated by Eriophorum angustifolium. The high fluxes observed from this vegetation type are significant because the areal distribution of this source in the mire is expanding due to ongoing thawing of the permafrost. A simple peat temperature relationship with CH(4) emissions was used to fill data gaps to construct a complete annual budget of CH(4) fluxes over the studied area. The calculated annual CH(4) emissions in 2006 and 2007 equaled 24.5 and 29.5 g CH(4) m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. The summer season CH(4) emissions dominated (65%) the annual flux, with the shoulder seasons of spring and autumn significant (25%) and a minor flux from the winter (10%).

AB Methane (CH4) emission was measured from an open fen on the Zoige Plateau (3500 m a.s.l.) (the eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau) during two winters of 2006 and 2007. Three dominant plant stands, including Carex muliensis Hand-Mazz. (CM), Eleocharis valleculosa Ohwif. setosa (Ohwi) Kitagawa.(EV) and Kobresia tibetica Maxim (KT) were chosen to be monitored. Winter CH4 emissions were roughly estimated to be 0.94 mg CH4 m(-2)h(-1). High spatial-temporal variations of the emission were found in this fen (the sequence of CM> EV> KT; 0.63 and 1.24 mg CH4 m(-2)h(-1) for 2006 and 2007, respectively). Factors involved in the spatial-temporal variation were: 1) water table in summer determining the winter amount of "old" CH4 stored in peat; 2) ice layer determining the release of CH4; 3) plant growth determining both the quantity of CH4 stored in peat and available substrates for CH4 production in winter. However, due to the homogeneity of freezing in winters, predictive factors such as plant growth and water table in summer could contribute more to winter CH4 emission than in situ freezing conditions. Considering that plant growth and water table are also the key factors controlling the spatial-temporal variation of CH4 emission in summer, we therefore suggested that winter CH4 emission represents the "inertia" of summer CH4 emission.

AB Landfill gas (LFG) is a renewable source of useful energy. Its world wide annual energy potential is in the range of a few hundred TWh. Today it is only marginally exploited. LFG is also an important contributor to the atmospheres CH4-content, it can be estimated to contribute about 25 % of the methane coming from anthropogenic sources. In comparison to many other sources of methane emissions such as peat bogs, rice paddies, termites and sheep, landfills can be considered to be point sources, i.e. they are stationary and of limited extension. For this reason landfill gas (LFG) utilisation is one of the most cost effective ways to combat the greenhouse effect.
   The aim of the IEA activity on LFG is to promote information exchange and co-operation between national programmes in order to promote the proliferation of landfill gas utilisation. During the period 1992-94 the LFG activity has had six participating countries: Canada, Denmark, Not-way, The Netherlands, Sweden, UK and USA. In the past three-year period, the activity has been mainly directed towards establishing networks and obtaining an over-view of data related to LFG in the member countries. Numerous contacts have been established and perhaps of most importance for the future of the activity are the links towards organisations involved in the development of landfill technology, such as ISWA and SWANA. The gathering and evaluation of data within the LFG area from the member countries has resulted in a number of documents that are to be published within the near future. These documents cover information on LFG utilisation, landfill research, landfill gas potentials, landfill emission assessment and also non-technical barriers to LFG utilisation.

AB Mountain peatlands often have mineral horizons embedded within or buried below the peat, which affects substrate quality and soil properties in subsurface peat. However, their role in greenhouse gases (GHG) production and GHG responses to temperature and water table changes are uncertain. We conducted a laboratory microcosm experiment to assess the effect of changes in temperature and water table on two peat profiles (with and without mineral sediments) on the GHG emission and concentrations and on the microbial community structure.
   Two soil types - sedge peat/mineral/calcareous sediments (PMC) and sedge peat/moss peat (PP) were incubated for 28 days under four temperature/water table treatments: 15 degrees C/-15 cm, 25 degrees C/-15 cm, 15 degrees C/-40 cm, and 25 degrees C/-40 cm. Surface GHG emissions and GHG concentrations from four depths (surface, above water table, below water table, and above mineral contact) were monitored. Results indicated that increasing temperature had the most significant effect on overall GHG emissions. High temperature increased GHG emission (CO2 by 28%, CH4 by 133% and 178% N2O) and concentrations at surface and at depth (CO2 by 32-83%, CH4 by 200-1600% and N2O by 61-230%) in most samples. In contrast, lowering the water table decreased only CH4 emissions. Soil types also significantly affected GHG emission and concentrations: CO2 and N2O from subsurface peat were higher in PP than PMC. Moreover, there was an interaction effect of temperature and soil types for N2O: concentrations in PP were more increased by high temperature above and below the water table.
   To understand how temperature influences GHG, especially N2O production, 25 degrees C/-15 cm incubated and Background (not incubated) cores were disassembled to measure apparent enzyme activation energy (Ea), and bacterial community structure above and below the water table. Results indicated that higher Ea and less relative abundance of copiotrophs were detected in PMC than in PP, because of less labile C in PMC. High temperature treatment also changed the microbial community structure at the class level in PP but not PMC. These together resulted in less increase of N2O production with increasing temperature in PMC. Overall, our findings suggest that peat profiles with mineral horizons may produce less GHG especially N2O when temperature increases. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The temperature dependence of the methane oxidation rate is estimated. The methane lifetime in the atmosphere is shown to decrease by about 3% from 1900 to 2005. The overwhelming fraction of the total methane content is removed from the atmosphere at intratropical latitudes during the daytime. The methane oxidation rate growth due to the temperature increase in the troposphere generates negative feedback in the methane cycle and, accordingly, climatic feedback with the same sign. According to the estimates performed, the halt in methane concentration growth in the atmosphere observed in recent years can be associated with a decrease in the lifetime of methane in the atmosphere. According to the results of numerical experiments with the climatic model of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences (IAP RAS), the climatic effect of negative feedback of the tropospheric temperature and the methane lifetime in the atmosphere is not large and is comparable with the climatic forcing of the methane emission growth from bog ecosystems.

AB Most studies of soil/atmosphere greenhouse gas exchange in Arctic and Sub-Arctic wetlands have been conducted by the use of small scale chamber techniques during the growing season. To improve the knowledge about the processes in the transition period from winter to growth season, an experiment is presented here showing measurements of CH4, CO2 and H2O using both chambers (only CH4) and eddy correlation technique from the thaw period in early spring and during mid summer. The emphasis is on a comparison between eddy correlation and chamber measurements of methane fluxes during spring thawing in a subarctic mire near Abisko, northern Sweden. Methane exchange as measured by the two techniques is compared and evaluated in relation to temperature variations and atmospheric conductance. During the thaw period, integrated daily net fluxes of CH, flux showed emission rates increasing from 2.6 mg m(-2) d(-1) to 22.5 mg m(-2) d(-1) within four days; the later rate corresponding to approximately 25% of the mid-summer flux. A profound diurnal cycle was observed in the release of methane, emphasising the importance of continuous measurements when calculating integrated fluxes.

AB Heterotrophic soil microorganisms rely on carbon (C) allocated belowground in plant production, but belowground C allocation (BCA) by plants is a poorly quantified part of ecosystem C cycling, especially, in peat soil. We applied a C balance approach to quantify BCA in a mixed conifer-red maple (Acer rubrum) forest on deep peat soil. Direct measurements of CH4 and CO2 fluxes across the soil surface (soil respiration), production of fine and small plant roots, and aboveground litterfall were used to estimate respiration by roots, by mycorrhizae and by free-living soil microorganisms. Measurements occurred in two consecutive years. Soil respiration rates averaged 1.2 bm mumol m(-2) s(-1) for CO2 and 0.58 nmol m(-2) s(-1) for CH4 (371 to 403 g C m(-2) year- 1). Carbon in aboveground litter (144 g C m(-2) year(-1)) was 84% greater than C in root production (78 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Complementary in vitro assays located high rates of anaerobic microbial activity, including methanogenesis, in a dense layer of roots overlying the peat soil and in large-sized fragments within the peat matrix. Large-sized fragments were decomposing roots and aboveground leaf and twig litter, indicating that relatively fresh plant production supported most of the anaerobic microbial activity. Respiration by free-living soil microorganisms in deep peat accounted for, at most, 29 to 38 g C m(-2) year(-1). These data emphasize the close coupling between plant production, ecosystem-level C cycling and soil microbial ecology, which BCA can help reveal.

AB The rate of oxidation of peat soils is highly seasonal and varies with temperature and soil moisture content. Large variations in soil moisture content result in wet-dry cycles that can enhance peat degradation. Water-table management plays a crucial role in controlling and damping the effect of these environmental factors. However, maintaining high ditch water levels in fields bounded by ditches does not guarantee a high field groundwater level. The effect of installing subsurface irrigation at different spacings on water table elevation was studied in a low-lying peat grassland. The water table elevation data were compared against values predicted with a water balance model. In addition, greenhouse experiments were carried out on undisturbed soil core samples collected from the peat grassland as well as a low-lying peatland under intensive arable faming to measure CO2 evolution under different water regimes. The field data from the peat grassland suggest that sub-irrigation spacing as low as 10 m is necessary during summer periods to maintain groundwater levels similar to those in the ditches. Over the same period of observation, the difference in water level between the ditches and the non-irrigated fields is as high as 0.7 m. Modelled outputs are in good correlation with the field observations, and demonstrate that simple water balance models can provide an effective tool to study the effect of water management practices and potential changes in subsurface conditions, climate and land use on water-table levels. The measurement of CO2 emission from undisturbed peat soil columns shows that the rate of oxidation of soil organic matter from peat soils is highly seasonal and that drainage exacerbates the rate of peat mineralization.

AB In contrast to previous peatland carbon dioxide (CO2) model sensitivity analyses, which usually focussed on only one or a few processes, this study investigates interactions between various biotic and abiotic processes and their parameters by comparing CoupModel v5 results with multiple observation variables.
   Many interactions were found not only within but also between various process categories simulating plant growth, decomposition, radiation interception, soil temperature, aerodynamic resistance, transpiration, soil hydrology and snow. Each measurement variable was sensitive to up to 10 (out of 54) parameters, from up to 7 different process categories. The constrained parameter ranges varied, depending on the variable and performance index chosen as criteria, and on other calibrated parameters (equifinalities).
   Therefore, transferring parameter ranges between models needs to be done with caution, especially if such ranges were achieved by only considering a few processes. The identified interactions and constrained parameters will be of great interest to use for comparisons with model results and data from similar ecosystems. All of the available measurement variables (net ecosystem exchange, leaf area index, sensible and latent heat fluxes, net radiation, soil temperatures, water table depth and snow depth) improved the model constraint. If hydraulic properties or water content were measured, further parameters could be constrained, resolving several equifinalities and reducing model uncertainty. The presented results highlight the importance of considering biotic and abiotic processes together and can help modellers and experimentalists to design and calibrate models as well as to direct experimental set-ups in peatland ecosystems towards modelling needs.

AB Hydrology controls the physical, chemical and biological processes in peatlands and hence could be the most important process regulating their function, development and characteristic biogeochemistry. Models describing hydrological processes and soil heat exchange phenomena are an important tool in understanding the peatland biogeochemical cycles of C and N. Presented in this paper is a peat soil climate model that uses weather data, mire site and peat characteristics as input data. The model is related to the heterogeneous peat characteristics (e.g. bulk density, degree of humification, remains of Sphagnum, Carex, Eriophorum and woody tissues), which in turn vary with depth. Evapotranspiration is related to weather parameters and tree stand characteristics. The model simulations were validated against the observed data collected during 1993 and 1994 growing seasons at a fen and bog sites at the Lakkasuo mire complex located in central Finland. The observed and simulated day-to-day variations in water table levels and soil temperatures during both seasons appeared overall to be in phase. As the model lacks the data needed to characterize the peat matrix hysteresis, the model was found lacking in response to wetting and drying cycles. The mean differences between simulated and observed water table levels during 1994 were -0.3 +/- 1.3 and -0.5 +/- 2.3 cm for the fen and bog sites, respectively. The model was found to be sensitive to mire surface characteristics and evapotranspiration, particularly for the bog site with an unsaturated zone deeper than at the fen. The absolute mean differences between the simulated and measured peat temperatures from 5 to 150 cm, were less than 1.0 degrees C with a maximal standard deviation of 1.6 degrees C. The model deviations for the upper layers showed larger variations compared to deeper layers, implying a greater accuracy in defining the lower boundary of the thermal regime within the peat column.

AB Vascular plants are known to influence the production, transport and oxidation of methane in wetland soils, but these processes are not well understood. Using plants grown in intact peat cores, we compared the influence upon methane emissions of 20 forb and graminoid species from European wetlands. We measured plant-mediated transport of methane (conduit or chimney effect) using a novel agar-sealing technique that prevented methane exchange from the bare soil to the atmosphere.
   The plant-mediated transport (chimney effect) represented between 30% and almost 100% of the total methane flux, with graminoids exhibiting greater internal transport than forbs. In general, plants with less dense root tissues and a relatively larger root volume exhibited a larger chimney effect. Most species (12 out of 20) significantly reduced methane emissions compared to bare soil and only one species, Succisa pratensis, increased them. We suggest that characterising vegetation in terms of plant functional traits and plant processes offers an effective method for estimating methane emissions from wetlands. However, we found no correlation between the magnitude of the chimney effect and the overall influence of different plant species on methane emissions. Besides introducing a useful tool to study plant-mediated transport, this work suggests that characterising vegetation in terms of functional traits could improve estimates of methane emissions from wetlands, which in turn could help in designing mitigation strategies.

AB Peatlands after drainage and extraction are large sources of carbon (C) to the atmosphere. Restoration, through re-wetting and revegetation, aims to return the C sink function by re-establishing conditions similar to that of an undrained peatland. However, the time needed to re-establish C sequestration is not well constrained due to the lack of multi-year measurements. We measured over 3 years the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), methane (FCH4), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at a restored post-extraction peatland (RES) in southeast Canada (restored 14 years prior to the start of the study) and compared our observations to the C balance of an intact reference peatland (REF) that has a long-term continuous flux record and is in the same climate zone. Small but significant differences in winter respiration driven by temperature were mainly responsible for differences in cumulative NEE between years. Low growing season inter-annual variability was linked to constancy of the initial spring water table position, controlled by the blocked drainage ditches and the presence of water storage structures (bunds and pools). Half-hour FCH4 at RES was small except when Typha latifolia-invaded drainage ditches were in the tower footprint; this effect at the ecosystem level was small as ditches represent a minor fraction of RES. The restored peatland was an annual sink for CO2 (-90 +/- 18 g C m(-2) year(-1)), a source of CH4 (4.4 +/- 0.2 g C m(-2) year(-1)), and a source of DOC (6.9 +/- 2.2 g C m(-2) year(-1)), resulting in mean net ecosystem uptake of 78 +/- 17 g C m(-2) year(-1). Annual NEE at RES was most similar to wetter, more productive years at REF. Integrating structures to increase water retention, alongside re-establishing key species, have been effective at re-establishing the net C sink rate to that of an intact peatland.

AB In this study, we simulated heterotrophic CO2 (Rh) fluxes at six European peatland sites using the ECOSSE model and compared them to estimates of Rh made from eddy covariance (EC) measurements. The sites are spread over four countries with different climates, vegetation and management. Annual Rh from the different sites ranged from 110 to 540 g C m(-2). The maximum annual Rh occurred when the water table (WT) level was between -10 and -25 cm and the air temperature was above 6.2 degrees C. The model successfully simulated seasonal trends for the majority of the sites. Regression relationships (r(2)) between the EC-derived and simulated Rh ranged from 0.28 to 0.76, and the root mean square error and relative error were small, revealing an acceptable fit. The overall relative deviation value between annual EC-derived and simulated Rh was small (-1 %) and model efficiency ranges across sites from -0.25 to +0.41. Sensitivity analysis highlighted that increasing temperature, decreasing precipitation and lowering WT depth could significantly increase Rh from soils. Thus, management which lowers the WT could significantly increase anthropogenic CO2, so from a carbon emissions perspective, it should be avoided. The results presented here demonstrate a robust basis for further application of the ECOSSE model to assess the impacts of future land management interventions on peatland carbon emissions and to help guide best practice land management decisions.

AB The influence of sulphate concentrations on the production and emission of methane in two contrasting peal sites was determined. Seasonal changes in sulphate concentrations appeared to influence the amount of organic carbon oxidised to carbon dioxide by sulphate reduction at both peat sites. For the majority of the year at both sites the amount of carbon mineralised through sulphate reduction exceeded that being transformed to methane by methanogenic bacteria, except when sulphate reduction became sulphate limited. In order to sustain the high sulphate reduction rates measured in the peat sulphide formed from dissimilatory sulphate reduction must be reoxidised rapidly to sulphate within;the peat. Laboratory experiments showed that addition of 500 mu M sulphate and 100 mu M nitrate to peat samples significantly inhibited methanogenesis. Sulphate appeared to be the more important inhibitor of methanogenesis since inhibition of methane formation occurred with additions of sulphate reflecting in situ concentrations. Supplements of either acetate and/or hydrogen in combination with molybdate to pear samples revealed that methanogenesis was hydrogen limited and that the majority of active methanogens were hydrogen-utilising methanogens. Methanogenesis in peat samples appeared to be dependant on sulphate reducing bacteria for provision of substrates. Great Dun Fell, receiving the largest sulphate loading, had the lower rates of microbial activity (methane formation and sulphate reduction rates) than Ellergower, which received less than half the annual sulphate deposition of Great Dun Fell. This implied that some other factor-possibly organic matter lability, was limiting microbial rates of methane formation and sulphate reduction at Great Dun Fell. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In previous studies, hydrated oil shale ash has demonstrated outstanding phosphorus removal. However, long-term efficiency in field conditions and the impact on greenhouse gas emissions was unknown. From November 2011 to October 2012 we measured purification of pretreated municipal wastewater and greenhouse gas fluxes in an experimental 5-cell horizontal subsurface flow filter filled with oil shale ash and well-mineralized peat in different proportions.
   The cell with 60 cm peat (HF1) removed 63% of the inflow total phosphorus (TP; median 22.0 mg P L (1)), whereas in cells with oil-shale ash HF2 (10 cm ash layer on 50 cm peat), HF3 (20 + 40 cm), HF4 (30 + 30 cm) and HF5 (60 cm ash), the TP removal efficiency was 70, 87, 98.6, and 99%, respectively. HFs 1-3 lost P removal capacity after 4 months, whereas in HFs 4-5 it remained throughout the experiment. HFs 4-5 increased the pH value and Ca2+ concentration in outflow. The oil shale ash cells showed lower CO2 emissions than the cells with peat. CH4 emissions were highest in HF2 and HF3 and N2O emissions in HF5. During the snowmelt a peak in N2O emission was observed. The estimated NH3 fluxes from HFs 3-5 accounted for 15-23% of the TN removal. During the long-term use of oil shale ash under open-air conditions, atmospheric CO2 binding did not affect P removal capacity. The current study serves a good knowledge for the development of ecologically sustainable filter systems for wastewater treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Given observed trends in the concentration of DOC in surface waters in the northern hemisphere the degradation of DOC to CO2 could represent a major and increasing source of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. However, studies of DOC turnover in rivers have been predominantly based upon mass balance studies and empirical studies have focused upon lakes and estuaries which have far longer residence times than would be the case for transit via rivers. The study measured DOC loss in unfiltered river water samples across an 818 km(2) catchment every month for a year and considered total loss, photo and aphotic degradation as well as the rates of each process. The study found:
   (i) Rate of total DOC change in daylight varied from loss of 30.1 mg C/I/day to an increase of 3.5 mg C/I/day: the average loss was 73% over 10 days.
   (ii) Rate of change due to photic processes varied from decrease of 19.4 mg C/I/day to an increase of 6 mg C/I/day, i.e. net photo-induced production was possible.
   (iii) Activation energy of the degradation was estimated as 2.6 +/- 1.2 kJ/g C.
   (iv) The apparent quantum yield varied from 9.6 to -1.7 mmol C/mol photons.
   (v) Coupling models of total loss of DOC with estimates of in-stream residence times showed that annual loss rates of DOC across the 818 km(2) catchment would be between 48% and 69%, in line with estimates from mass balance studies, implying that in-stream DOC degradation represents a large, indirect source of CO2 emissions from peats and other organic soils.
   (vi) Annual rate of removal was increasing in line with increasing loss of DOC at source, implying that observed DOC trends are leading to increased CO2 emissions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The contribution of Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. (common reed) litter as an origin of CH4-C was studied in a microcosm experiment. C-14-labelled, dried and ground P. australis root and shoot litter was buried in waterlogged, planted or non-planted fen microcosms. The evolution of (CO2)-C-14 and (CH4)-C-14 from the pots was monitored during the 35-day experiment. The C-14 activity in the shoots and roots of the plants, soil, and inundation water was also analysed at the end of the experiment. Up to 40% of the released CH4-C originated from the added litter, whereas the rest originated from old soil organic matter. The comparison of planted and non-planted pots suggested that the contribution of recent plant-derived C (i.e. root exudates) to CH4 emission was negligible. The proportion of litter-derived CH4-C was significantly higher in the planted pots, suggesting that the presence of plants enhanced the formation of CH4 from litter. The major part of the initial C-14 activity was recovered from the soil. About 3% was recovered from the inundation water, about 10% was emitted as CO2, and only <0.01% as CH4. However, these results demonstrated that plant litter and old soil organic matter are the major sources of CH4-C in fens during the early growth stage of P. australis.

AB O-3 concentrations in the troposphere are rising and those in the stratosphere decreasing, the latter resulting in higher fluxes of solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation to the earth's surface. We assessed whether the fluxes of CO2 and CH4 are altered by enhanced UV-B radiation or elevated tropospheric O-3 concentrations in boreal peatland microcosms (core depth 40 cm, diameter 10.5 cm) with different vegetation cover. At the end of the UV-B experiment which lasted for a growing season, net CO2 exchange (NEE) and dark ecosystem respiration (R (TOT)) were sevenfold higher, and CH4 efflux 12-fold higher, in microcosms with intact vegetation dominated by Eriophorum vaginatum L. and Sphagnum spp., compared to microcosms from which we removed E. vaginatum. Vegetation treatment had minor effects on CH4 production and consumption potentials in the peat, suggesting that the large difference in CH4 efflux is mainly due to efficient CH4 transport via the aerenchyma of E. vaginatum. Ambient UV-B supplemented with 30% and elevated O-3 concentrations (100 and 200 ppb, for 7 weeks) significantly increased R-TOT in both vegetation treatments. Elevated O-3 concentrations reduced NEE over time, while UV-B had no clear effects on the fluxes of CO2 or CH4 in the cloudy summer of the study. Field experiments are needed to assess the significance of increasing UV-B radiation and elevated tropospheric O-3 concentration on peatland gas exchange in the long-term.

AB Terrestrial export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to watercourses has increased in boreal zone. Effect of decomposing material and soil food webs on the release rate and quality of DOC are poorly known. We quantified carbon (C) release in CO2, and DOC in different molecular weights from the most common organic soils in boreal zone; and explored the effect of soil type and enchytraeid worms on the release rates. Two types of mor and four types of peat were incubated in laboratory with and without enchytraeid worms for 154 days at + 15 A degrees C. Carbon was mostly released as CO2; DOC contributed to 2-9% of C release. The share of DOC was higher in peat than in mor. The release rate of CO2 was three times higher in mor than in highly decomposed peat. Enchytraeids enhanced the release of CO2 by 31-43% and of DOC by 46-77% in mor. High molecular weight fraction dominated the DOC release. Upscaling the laboratory results into catchment level allowed us to conclude that peatlands are the main source of DOC, low molecular weight DOC originates close to watercourse, and that enchytraeids substantially influence DOC leaching to watercourse and ultimately to aquatic CO2 emissions.

AB Methane emissions and below ground methane pore water concentrations were determined in an alpine fen at 1,915 m a.s.l. in central Switzerland. The fen represented an acidic (pH 4.5-4.9), nutrient-poor to mesotrophic habitat dominated by Carex limosa, Carex rostrata, Trichophorum caespitosum and Sphagnum species. From late fall to late spring the fen was snow-covered. Throughout winter the temperatures never dropped below 0A degrees C at 5 cm below the vegetation surface. Methane emissions in June, July, August and September were in the range of 125 (+/- 26)-313 (+/- 71) mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) with a tendency to decrease along the summer season. Mean methane pore water concentrations at a depth of 20-40 cm below the vegetation surface were 526 (+/- 32) mu M in June and in the range of 144 (+/- 10)-233 (+/- 7) mu M in July, August and September. At a depth of 0-20 cm the mean methane pore water concentrations dropped back to < 20 mu M with an almost linear decrease between 0 and 15 cm. Oxygen pore water concentrations were close to air saturation in the first few centimeters and dropped back below detection limit at a depth of 20 cm. In July and August the pore water concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were in the range of 7.2-10.1 mg C l(-1) at all depths. The pore water concentrations of acetate, formate and oxalate were in the range of 2.0-8.2 mu M at all depths. Methanotrophic and methanogenic communities were quantified using pmoA and mcrA, respectively, as marker genes. The abundances of both communities showed a distinct peak at a depth of 10-15 cm below the vegetation surface.

AB Carbon (C) modeling and carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements in peatlands are dependent on the distribution and productivity of vegetation in a system with a high degree of spatial variability, often linked to the position of the water table. We tested the hypothesis that at a fine-scale (tens of metres) water table position exerts a strong control on species abundance, plant biomass, particularly photosynthetically active tissues, leaf area index (LAI), and areal foliar N and chlorophyll at Mer Bleue, a cool temperate peatland in eastern Canada. Total aboveground biomass ranged from 147 to 1011 g center dot m(-2), with shrubs contributing between 42% and 72% of the total in the transects. We found significant (P < 0.05) positive relationships between foliar and total vascular plant biomass and mean water table position, and significant decreases in the shrub foliar:woody biomass ratio and moss biomass with a lower water table. However, there was no significant relationship between water table position and photosynthetically active tissues (vascular plant leaves and moss capitulum), ranging from 114 to 672 g center dot m(-2)) and the areal mass of N in these tissues, ranging from 1.5 to 6.7 g center dot m(-2). Multivariate analyses of vegetation and environmental data showed that species distribution could be explained by both water table and chemistry gradients and that unimodal rather than linear responses best described the species and water table relationships. LAI ranged from 0.1 to over 3 and was correlated with both water table position and with vascular foliar biomass. Percent cover of shrubs was correlated with foliar biomass and LAI. Our results suggest that the less labour-intensive estimates of percent cover can be used to predict the vascular plant foliar biomass and LAI measurements. The lack of relationship between photosynthetically active tissues, tissue N concentrations, and water table may also explain the surprising lack of spatial variability in peak growing season eddy flux net ecosystem CO2 exchange in three different areas of the peatland.

AB CO2 production in terrestrial ecosystems is generally assumed to be solely biologically driven while the role of abiotic processes has been largely overlooked. In addition to microbial decomposition, photodegradation - the direct breakdown of organic matter (OM) by solar irradiance - has been found to contribute to litter mass loss in dry ecosystems. Previous small-scale studies have shown that litter degradation by irradiance is accompanied by emissions of CO2. However, the contribution of photodegradation to total CO2 losses at ecosystems scales is unknown. This study determined the proportion of the total CO2 losses caused by photodegradation in two ecosystems: a bare peatland in New Zealand and a seasonally dry grassland in California. The direct effect of solar irradiance on CO2 production was examined by comparing daytime CO2 fluxes measured using eddy covariance (EC) systems with simultaneous measurements made using an opaque chamber and the soil CO2 gradient technique, and with night-time EC measurements under the same soil temperature and moisture conditions. In addition, a transparent chamber was used to directly measure CO2 fluxes from OM caused by solar irradiance. Photodegradation contributed 19% of the annual CO2 flux from the peatland and almost 60% of the dry season CO2 flux from the grassland, and up to 62% and 92% of the summer mid-day CO2 fluxes, respectively. Our results suggest that photodegradation may be important in a wide range of ecosystems with exposed OM. Furthermore, the practice of partitioning daytime ecosystem CO2 exchange into its gross components by assuming that total daytime CO2 losses can be approximated using estimates of biological respiration alone may be in error. To obtain robust estimates of global ecosystem-atmosphere carbon transfers, the contribution of photodegradation to OM decomposition must be quantified for other ecosystems and the results incorporated into coupled carbon-climate models.

AB Arctic regions contain large amounts of organic carbon (OC) trapped in soil and wetland permafrost. With climate warming, parr of this OC is released to aquatic systems and degraded by microorganisms, thus resulting, in positive feedback due to carbon (C) emission. In wetland areas, water bodies are spatially heterogenic and separated by landscape position and water residence time. This represents a hydrological continuum, from depressions, smaller water bodies and lakes to the receiving streams and rivers. Yet, the effect of this heterogeneity on the OC release from the soil and its processing in waters is largely unknown and not accounted for in C cycle models of Arctic regions. Here we investigated the dissolved OC (DOC) biodegradation of aquatic systems along a hydrological continuum located in two discontinuous permafrost sites: in western Siberia and northern Sweden. The biodegradable dissolved OC (BDOC15; %DOC lost relative to the initial DOC concentration after 15 days incubation at 20 degrees C) ranged from 0 to 20% for small water bodies located at the beginning of the continuum (soil solutions, small ponds, fen and lakes) and from 10 to 20% for streams and rivers. While the BDOC15 increased, the removal rate of DOC decreased along the hydrological continuum. The potential maximum CO2 production from DOC biodegradation was estimated to account for only a small part of in-situ CO2 emissions measured in peatland aquatic systems of northern Sweden and western Siberia. This suggests that other sources, such as sediment respiration and soil input, largely contribute to CO2 emissions from small surface waters of permafrost peatlands. Our results highlight the need to account for large heterogeneity of dissolved OC concentration and biodegradability in order to quantify C cycling in arctic water bodies susceptible to permafrost thaw.

AB Winter climate change may result in reduced snow cover and could, consequently, alter the soil frost regime and biogeochemical processes underlying the exchange of methane (CH4) in boreal peatlands. In this study, we investigated the short-term (1-3years) vs. long-term (11years) effects of intensified winter soil frost (induced by experimental snow exclusion) on CH4 exchange during the following growing season in a boreal peatland. In the first 3years (2004-2006), lower CH4 emissions in the treatment plots relative to the control coincided with delayed soil temperature increase in the treatment plots at the beginning of the growing season (May). After 11 treatment years (in 2014), CH4 emissions were lower in the treatment plots relative to the control over the entire growing season, resulting in a reduction in total growing season CH4 emission by 27%. From May to July 2014, reduced sedge leaf area coincided with lower CH4 emissions in the treatment plots compared to the control. From July to August, lower dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the pore water of the treatment plots explained 72% of the differences in CH4 emission between control and treatment. In addition, greater Sphagnum moss growth in the treatment plots resulted in a larger distance between the moss surface and the water table (i.e., increasing the oxic layer) which may have enhanced the CH4 oxidation potential in the treatment plots relative to the control in 2014. The differences in vegetation might also explain the lower temperature sensitivity of CH4 emission observed in the treatment plots relative to the control. Overall, this study suggests that greater soil frost, associated with future winter climate change, might substantially reduce the growing season CH4 emission in boreal peatlands through altering vegetation dynamics and subsequently causing vegetation-mediated effects on CH4 exchange.

AB Although the contribution of methane emission to global change is well recognized, analyses of net methane emissions derived from alpine regions are rare. Therefore, three fen sites differing in water balance and plant community, as well as one dry meadow site, were used to study the importance of soil temperature, water table, and plant biomass as controlling factors for net methane emission in the Eastern Alps, Europe, during a period of 24 months. Average methane emissions during snow-free periods in the fen ranged between 19 and 116 mg CH4 m(-2)d(-1).. Mean wintertime emissions were much lower and accounted for 18 to 59% of annual flux. The alpine dry meadow functions as a methane sink during snow-free periods, with mean flux of -2.1 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) (2003) and -1.0 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) (2004). Seasonal methane emissions of the fen were related to soil temperature and groundwater table. During the snow-free periods the water table was the main control for seasonal methane emission. The net methane flux related to water table was much higher for the distinctly drier year 2003 than for the wetter year 2004. Methane emissions differed diurnally at sites where the water table position was high or very low. The influence of total above-ground plant biomass on methane emission was apparent only for those sites with high water table positions. Seasonal and diurnal methane uptake of the dry meadow was related to soil temperature and water-filled pore space, whereas plant biomass did not significantly influence methane fluxes. Our studies gave evidence that fens in the Eastern Alps act as a source of methane throughout the whole year and that a dry meadow site acts as a net methane sink during snow-free periods.

AB Peatlands are a large source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, yet the uncertainty around the estimates of CH4 flux from peatlands is large. To better understand the spatial heterogeneity in temperate peatland CH4 emissions and their response to physical and biological drivers, we studied CH4 dynamics throughout the growing seasons of 2017 and 2018 in Flatiron Lake Bog, a kettle-hole peat bog in Ohio. The site is composed of six different hydrobiological zones: an open water zone, four concentric vegetation zones surrounding the open water, and a restored zone connected to the main bog by a narrow channel. At each of these locations, we monitored water level (WL), CH4 pore-water concentration at different peat depths, CH4 fluxes from the ground and from representative plant species using chambers, and microbial community composition with a focus here on known methanogens and methanotrophs. Integrated CH4 emissions for the growing season were estimated as 315.4 +/- 166 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) in 2017 and 362.3 +/- 687 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) in 2018. Median CH4 emission was highest in the open water, then it decreased and became more variable through the concentric vegetation zones as the WL dropped, with extreme emission hotspots observed in the tamarack mixed woodlands (Tamarack) and low emissions in the restored zone (18.8-30.3 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). Generally, CH4 flux from above-ground vegetation was negligible compared to ground flux (< 0.4 %), although blueberry plants were a small CH4 sink. Pore-water CH4 concentrations varied significantly among zones, with the highest values in the Tamarack zone, close to saturation, and the lowest values in the restored zone. While the CH4 fluxes and pore-water concentrations were not correlated with methanogen relative abundance, the ratio of methanogens to methanotrophs in the upper portion of the peat was significantly correlated to CH4 transfer velocity (the CH4 flux divided by the difference in CH4 pore-water concentration between the top of the peat profile and the concentration in equilibrium with the atmosphere). Since ebullition and plant-mediated transport were not important sources of CH4 and the peat structure and porosity were similar across the different zones in the bog, we conclude that the differences in CH4 transfer velocities, and thus the flux, are driven by the ratio of methanogen to methanotroph relative abundance close to the surface. This study illustrates the importance of the interactions between water-level and microbial composition to better understand CH4 fluxes from bogs and wetlands in general.

AB Peatlands store 30% of the world's terrestrial soil carbon (C) and those located at northern latitudes are expected to experience rapid climate warming. We monitored growing season carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes across a factorial design of in situ water table (control, drought, and flooded plots) and soil warming (control vs. warming via open top chambers) treatments for 2 years in a rich fen located just outside the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest in interior Alaska. The drought (lowered water table position) treatment was a weak sink or small source of atmospheric CO2 compared to the moderate atmospheric CO2 sink at our control. This change in net ecosystem exchange was due to lower gross primary production and light-saturated photosynthesis rather than increased ecosystem respiration. The flooded (raised water table position) treatment was a greater CO2 sink in 2006 due largely to increased early season gross primary production and higher light-saturated photosynthesis. Although flooding did not have substantial effects on rates of ecosystem respiration, this water table treatment had lower maximum respiration rates and a higher temperature sensitivity of ecosystem respiration than the control plot. Surface soil warming increased both ecosystem respiration and gross primary production by approximately 16% compared to control (ambient temperature) plots, with no net effect on net ecosystem exchange. Results from this rich fen manipulation suggest that fast responses to drought will include reduced ecosystem C storage driven by plant stress, whereas inundation will increase ecosystem C storage by stimulating plant growth.

AB Long-term increased nutrient influx into normally nutrient-limited peatlands in combination with altered hydrological conditions may threaten a peatland's carbon storage function and affect its greenhouse gas (GHG) budget. However, in situ studies on the effects of long-term altered conditions on peatland functioning and GHG budgets are scarce. We thus quantified GHG fluxes in a peatland exposed to enhanced water level fluctuations and long-term nutrient infiltration in Ontario, Canada, via eddy-covariance and flux chamber measurements. The peatland was a prominent sink of - 680 +/- 202 g carbon dioxide (CO2) and a source of 22 +/- 8 g methane (CH4) m(-2) year(-1), resulting in a negative radiative forcing of - 80 g CO2 eq. m(-2) y(-1). During the growing season CH4 fluxes were constantly high (0.1 g m(-2) s(-1)). Further, on three dates, we measured nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes and observed a small flux of 2.2 mg m(-2) day(-1) occurring during the thawing period. Taking the studied ecosystem as a model system for other peatlands exposed to long-term increased nutrient infiltration and enhanced water level fluctuations, our data suggest that such peatlands can maintain their carbon storage function and CO2 sequestration may outweigh emissions of CH4.

AB Three years (2009-2011) of near-continuous methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured with the eddy covariance (EC) technique at a temperate peatland located within the Marcell Experimental Forest, in northern Minnesota, USA. The peatland was a net source of CH4 and a net sink of CO2 in each year with annual carbon budgets of -26.8 (+/- 18.7), -15.5 (+/- 14.8), and -14.6 (+/- 21.5) g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2009-2011, respectively. Differences in the seasonal hydrometeorological conditions among the three study years were most pronounced during 2011, which was considerably warmer (+1.3 degrees C) and wetter (+40 mm) than the 30 year average. The annual CH4 budget was +11.8 (+/- 3.1), +12.2 (+/- 3.0), and +24.9 (+/- 5.6) g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the respective years and accounted for 23%-39% of the annual carbon budget. The larger CH4 emission in 2011 is attributed to significant warming of the peat column coupled with a high water table position throughout the entire growing season. Historical (1991-2011) CH4 emissions were estimated based on long-term hydrometeorological records and functional relationships derived from our 3 year field study. The predicted historical annual CH4 budget ranged from +7.8 to +15.2 (+/- 2.7) g CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1). Recent (2007-2011) increases in temperature, precipitation, and rising water table at this site suggest that CH4 emissions have been increasing, but were generally greater from 1991 to 1999 when average soil temperature and precipitation were higher than in recent years. The global warming potential (considering CO2 and CH4) for this peatland was calculated based on a 100 year time horizon. In all three study years, the peatland had a net positive radiative forcing on climate and was greatest (+187 g C m(-2)) in 2011. The interannual variability in CH4 exchange at this site suggests high sensitivity to variations in hydrometeorological conditions. Citation: Olson, D. M., T. J. Griffis, A. Noormets, R. Kolka and J.

AB Methane fluxes were measured in an area of ombrotrophic mire at the Migneint in North Wales. Measurements were made at approximately monthly intervals between August 1993 and August 1995. A marked seasonal change in emission rates was noted. Peaks of methane emission were observed in August 1993 (6.2 mg m(-2) d(-1)), September 1994 (6.0 mg m(-2) d(-1)) and June 1995 (5.5 mg m(-2) d(-1)). Minimum emission rates were recorded in March 1994 (0.8 mg m(-2) d(-1)) and March 1995 (1.4 mg m(-2) d(-1)). Nitrogen, in the form of ammonium and/or nitrate, was applied to plots on the mire surface. Between August 1993 and July 1994 application rates were equivalent to a 50 or 100% increase in N deposition. From August 1994 to August 1995 the application rates were equivalent to a 500 or 1000% increase in N deposition. These applications of nitrogen had no effect on the methane emission rates at any date, with the exception of the measurement from November 1994. No correlation was found between methane flux and either soil temperature or water table. We suggest that the state of the vegetation at the site may be important, either through the role of the plants in transport of methane, or as the source of the organic carbon that is the substrate for methanogenesis.

AB Natural wetlands are a significant source of atmospheric methane, an important greenhouse gas. Compared with numerous papers on measurements of methane emission from natural wetland surfaces, there are few reports on methane configuration and distribution within wetland soil profiles. By using a newly designed gas sampler, we succeeded in collecting free-phase gas from beneath the water table down to 120 cm in a peat. The volumetric percentage of methane in the gas phase increased with depth and was generally more than 50% beneath the zone within which the water table fluctuates. The volume of the gas phase in the peat beneath the water table was estimated to be from 0 to 19% with significant variation with depth, suggesting uneven distribution of gas bubbles. Using the volume ratio of the gas and liquid phases and methane concentration data in the gas phase, as well as assuming that methane was in equilibrium (based on Henry's Law between the two phases), we calculated that similar to 60% of the methane accumulates in the form of bubbles. These results suggest the importance of ebullition in methane emission, which might be a major cause for the reportedly large variation of methane emission in both space and time. Most importantly, our results show the need to consider gaseous-phase methane for understanding the production, transport and emission mechanisms of methane in wetlands, which has been overlooked to date.

AB This review covers selected aspects of recent international efforts to measure and model greenhouse gas emission from northern wetlands, to identify the environmental factors that control gas emission, and to investigate wetlands' responses (particularly with respect to gas emission) to global change. Both bottom-up and top-to-bottom approaches, based respectively on local observations plus inventory of gas fluxes and inverse modelling of global circulation, agree on the size of the high latitude (>60 degrees N) contribution to global methane, which should be about 13% or 70 Tg/year. It has been shown that winter and spring fluxes are an essential part in the annual budget of CH4 and especially CO2 exchange (varying from 5 to 50%). Soil micro-organisms were shown to be able to respire during winter even at -16 degrees C. In comparison to aerobically respiring organisms, anaerobic methanogenic bacteria were less active in frozen soil, although they are subjected to significant stimulation by soil freeze-thaw cycles. The absence of immediate coupling of methanogenesis with plant photosynthesis implies that substrates for methane formation are derived from peat decomposition rather than from root exudation.

AB In high-latitude regions, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions during the winter represent an important component of the annual ecosystem carbon budget; however, the mechanisms that control the winter CO2 emissions are currently not well understood. It has been suggested that substrate availability from soil labile carbon pools is a main driver of winter CO2 emissions. In ecosystems that are dominated by annual herbaceous plants, much of the biomass produced during the summer is likely to contribute to the soil labile carbon pool through litter fall and root senescence in the autumn. Thus, the summer carbon uptake in the ecosystem may have a significant influence on the subsequent winter CO2 emissions. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a plot-scale shading experiment in a boreal peatland to reduce the gross primary production (GPP) during the growing season. At the growing season peak, vascular plant biomass in the shaded plots was half that in the control plots. During the subsequent winter, the mean CO2 emission rates were 21% lower in the shaded plots than in the control plots. In addition, long-term (2001-2012) eddy covariance data from the same site showed a strong correlation between the GPP (particularly the late summer and autumn GPP) and the subsequent winter net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). In contrast, abiotic factors during the winter could not explain the interannual variation in the cumulative winter NEE. Our study demonstrates the presence of a cross-seasonal link between the growing season biotic processes and winter CO2 emissions, which has important implications for predicting winter CO2 emission dynamics in response to future climate change.

AB We studied concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the eutrophic Temmesjoki River and Estuary in the Liminganlahti Bay in 2003-2004 and evaluated the atmospheric fluxes of the gases based on measured concentrations, wind speeds and water current velocities. The Temmesjoki River was a source of CO2, CH4 and N2O to the atmosphere, whereas the Liminganlahti Bay was a minor source of CH4 and a minor source or a sink of CO2 and N2O. The results show that the fluxes of greenhouse gases in river ecosystems are highly related to the land use in its catchment areas. The most upstream river site, surrounded by forests and drained peatlands, released significant amounts of CO2 and CH4, with average fluxes of 5,400 mg CO2-C m(-2) d(-1) and 66 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1), and concentrations of 210 mu M and 345 nM, respectively, but N2O concentrations, at an average of 17 nM, were close to the atmospheric equilibrium concentration. The downstream river sites surrounded by agricultural soils released significant amounts of N2O (with an average emission of 650 mu g N2O-N m(-2) d(-1) and concentration of 22 nM), whereas the CO2 and CH4 concentrations were low compared to the upstream site (55 mu M and 350 nM). In boreal regions, rivers are partly ice-covered in wintertime (approximately 5 months). A large part of the gases, i.e. 58% of CO2, 55% of CH4 and 36% of N2O emissions, were found to be released during wintertime from unfrozen parts of the river.

AB Drained peatlands often act as carbon dioxide (CO2) hotspots. Raising the groundwater table is expected to reduce their CO2 contribution to the atmosphere and revitalise their function as carbon (C) sink in the long term. Without strict water management rewetting often results in partial flooding and the formation of spatially heterogeneous, nutrient-rich shallow lakes. Uncertainties remain as to when the intended effect of rewetting is achieved, as this specific ecosystem type has hardly been investigated in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange. In most cases of rewetting, methane (CH4) emissions increase under anoxic conditions due to a higher water table and in terms of global warming potential (GWP) outperform the shift towards CO2 uptake, at least in the short term.
   Based on eddy covariance measurements we studied the ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of CH4 and CO2 at a shallow lake situated on a former fen grassland in northeastern Germany. The lake evolved shortly after flooding, 9 years previous to our investigation period. The ecosystem consists of two main surface types: open water (inhabited by submerged and floating vegetation) and emergent vegetation (particularly including the eulittoral zone of the lake, dominated by Typha latifolia). To determine the individual contribution of the two main surface types to the net CO2 and CH4 exchange of the whole lake ecosystem, we combined footprint analysis with CH4 modelling and net ecosystem exchange partitioning.
   The CH4 and CO2 dynamics were strikingly different between open water and emergent vegetation. Net CH4 emissions from the open water area were around 4-fold higher than from emergent vegetation stands, accounting for 53 and 13aEuro-gaEuro-CH(4)aEuro-m(-2)aEuro-a(-1) respectively. In addition, both surface types were net CO2 sources with 158 and 750aEuro-gaEuro-CO(2)aEuro-m(-2)aEuro-a(-1) respectively. Unusual meteorological conditions in terms of a warm and dry summer and a mild winter might have facilitated high respiration rates. In sum, even after 9 years of rewetting the lake ecosystem exhibited a considerable C loss and global warming impact, the latter mainly driven by high CH4 emissions. We assume the eutrophic conditions in combination with permanent high inundation as major reasons for the unfavourable GHG balance.

AB The global loss of peatlands, by drainage or peat extraction, has encouraged measures to restore these ecosystems and their function as carbon sinks. However, there is a potential of high emissions of the potent greenhouse gas CH4 from restored peatlands. Vascular plants, which often dominate restored sites, play a key role in determining the amount of emitted CH4: The plants can either fuel methanogenesis by supplying labile carbon or attenuate methanogenesis by transferring oxygen into the rhizosphere. To quantify the net effect of these counteracting processes, we tested in a two-pronged approach CH4 production, emission, and the underlying processes in (1.) monoliths of three different restored cutover peatlands and in (2.) mesocosms with Eriophorwn vaginatwn, E. angustifolium and Juncos effusus versus controls with Sphagna and bare peat. Despite waterlogged, and thus persisting anoxic conditions, concentrations of dissolved CH4 remained close to zero in all tested monoliths. We ascribe this finding to two factors: The poor decomposability of the peat material, as determined in anoxic incubations, and the availability of alternative electron acceptors that sustained anaerobic respiration and competitively suppressed methanogenesis. While inorganic electron acceptor pools were small and rapidly diminished, dissolved organic matter provided constant electron acceptor capacity, indicating that reducible moieties in the organic matter were continuously re-oxidized in the rhizosphere of all tested vascular plant species. This continuous re-oxidation of the dissolved organic matter correlated with plant growth rates (R-2 = 0.6-0.8), suggesting that supply of oxygen through the aerenchyma of plant roots regenerated electron acceptor capacity in the rhizosphere. Vascular plants may have differential effects on the net ecosystem exchange, however, our findings suggest that CH4 concentrations and emissions may remain low in restored cutover peatlands for months to years. Thus, waterlogging and vascular plant cover of degraded cutover peat lands does not necessarily create hot-spots of CH4 emissions.

AB Peat soils represent an important global carbon (C) sink, but can also provide a highly fertile medium for growing horticultural crops. Sustainable crop production on peat soils involves a trade-off between ensuring food security and mitigating typically high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and rates of soil C loss. An alternative approach to resource intensive field-based monitoring of GHG fluxes for all potential management scenarios is to use a process-based model driven by existing field data to estimate emissions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of the Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model for estimating emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4 from horticultural peat soils. The model was parameterised using climatic, soil, and crop management data from two intensively cultivated sites on soils of contrasting soil organic matter (SOM) contents ( similar to 35% and similar to 70% SOM content). Simulated emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4, and simulated soil physical and crop output values, were compared to actual GHG, soil and crop measurements. Model performance was assessed using baseline parameterisation (i.e. model defaults), then calibrated using pre-simulation and sensitivity analysis processes. Under baseline parameterisation conditions, DNDC proved poor at predicting GHG emissions and soil/crop variables. Calibration and validation improved DNDC performance in estimating the annual magnitude of emissions, but model refinement is still required for reproducing seasonal GHG patterns in particular. Key constraints on model functioning appear to be its ability to reliably model soil moisture and some aspects of C and nitrogen dynamics, as well as the quality of input data relating to water table dynamics. In conclusion, our results suggest that the DNDC (v. 9.5) model cannot accurately reproduce or be used to replace actual field measurements for estimation of GHG emission factors under different management scenarios for horticultural peat soils, but may be able to do so with further modification.

AB Methanogenesis was studied in water-saturated pear cores from hollows in Ellergower Moss, New Galloway, Scotland. The concentration of CH4, increased with depth from 0.8 mu M at the surface to reach a plateau of 500 mu M at 14 cm; at this depth CO2 concentrations often reached 10 fold those of CH4. O-2 decreased from near air saturation to less than 10 nM at 6 cm depth. Argon transport from the top of the core downwards occurred more rapidly (D = 0.8-7 x 10(-8) m(2) s(-1), dependent on depth) than could be accounted for by simple diffusion through the peat. Vascular plants (Molinia, Eriophorum and Carex) had well-developed roots and were adapted to water-logged conditions in that they possessed extensive aerenchymatous lacunae throughout their roots, shoots and leaves. As well as facilitating O-2 diffusion downwards to submerged tissues,this system enables rapid diffusion upwards of CH4. This process of gaseous transport in vascular plants is subject to control by stomata. Emission rates of CO2 and CH4 thus show diurnal rhythms at constant temperature. Free-run of CO2 oscillation in the dark at 15 cm depth indicates circadian clock control. The temperature sensitivity of CH4 emission is remarkably high Q(10) = 3.0 between 10 and 20 degrees C in the dark); in cores kept under natural conditions of temperature and daylight the daily rhythms entrain to the peat temperature cycles.

AB This is the first attempt to budget average current annual carbon (C) and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) exchanges and transfers in a subarctic landscape, the Lake Tornetrask catchment in northern Sweden. This is a heterogeneous area consisting of almost 4000 km 2 of mixed heath, birch and pine forest, and mires, lakes and alpine ecosystems. The magnitudes of atmospheric exchange of carbon in the form of the GHGs, CO2 and CH4 in these various ecosystems differ significantly, ranging from little or no flux in barren ecosystems over a small CO2 sink function and low rates of CH4 exchange in the heaths to significant CO2 uptake in the forests and also large emissions of CH4 from the mires and small lakes. The overall catchment budget, given the size distribution of the individual ecosystem types and a first approximation of run-off as dissolved organic carbon, reveals a landscape currently with a significant sink capacity for atmospheric CO2. This sink capacity is, however, extremely sensitive to environmental changes, particularly those that affect the birch forest ecosystem. Climatic drying or wetting and episodic events such as insect outbreaks may cause significant changes in the sink function. Changes in the sources of CH4 through increased permafrost melting may also easily change the sign of the current radiative forcing, due to the stronger impact per gram of CH4 relative to CO2. Hence, to access impacts on climate, the atmospheric C balance alone has to be weighed in a radiative forcing perspective. When considering the emissions of CH4 from the mires and lakes as CO2 equivalents, the Tornetrask catchment is currently a smaller sink of radiative forcing, but it can still be estimated as representing the equivalent of approximately 14 000 average Swedish inhabitants' emissions of CO2. This can be compared with the carbon emissions of less than 200 people who live permanently in the catchment, although this comparison disregards substantial emissions from the non-Swedish tourism and transportation activities.

AB The surface of bogs is commonly patterned and composed of different vegetation communities, defined by water level. Carbon dioxide (CO2) dynamics vary spatially between the vegetation communities. An understanding of the controls on the spatial variation of CO2 dynamics is required to assess the role of bogs in the global carbon cycle. The water level gradient in a blanket bog was described and the CO2 exchange along the gradient investigated using chamber based measurements in combination with regression modelling. The aim was to investigate the controls on gross photosynthesis (PG), ecosystem respiration (RE) and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) as well as the spatial and temporal variation in these fluxes. Vegetation structure was strongly controlled by water level. The species with distinctive water level optima were separated into the opposite ends of the gradient in canonical correspondence analysis. The number of species and leaf area were highest in the intermediate water level range and these communities had the highest PG. Photosynthesis was highest when the water level was 11 cm below the surface. Ecosystem respiration, which includes decomposition, was less dependent on vegetation structure and followed the water level gradient more directly. The annual NEE varied from -115 to 768 g CO2 m(-2), being lowest in wet and highest in dry vegetation communities. The temporal variation was most pronounced in PG, which decreased substantially during winter, when photosynthetic photon flux density and leaf area were lowest. Ecosystem respiration, which is dependent on temperature, was less variable and wintertime RE fluxes constituted approximately 24% of the annual flux.

AB Water table fluctuations influence the carbon balance of wetlands, but the effects are difficult to isolate and quantify in field investigations. Thus, we compared C mineralization in a peatland mesocosm exposed to a water table fluctuation (from 5 to 67 cm beneath the surface) with that in mesocosms with a stable high water table (2 to 6 cm depth) and with production rates obtained from flask incubations. Net turnover rates were calculated from concentration data by diffusive-advective mass-balances. Under stable, high water table conditions, net production of CO2 (6.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), CH4 (2.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and DOC (15.4 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) were vertically stratified and production and fluxes equilibrated. Lowering and raising the water table from 5 to 67 cm resulted in complex patterns of net CH4 and CO2 production. Response and equilibration times of processes upon drainage and flooding ranged from days (aerobic CO, production, CH4 oxidation, fluxes under unsaturated conditions) to months (CH4 production, fluxes under saturated conditions). Averaged over the water table fluctuation, net production of CH4 decreased to 0.36 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and that of CO2 increased to 140 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Physical disturbance through the incubation of peat strongly increased production rates of CO2, CH4 and DOC compared to in situ, steady state rates. The decoupling of production and fluxes to the atmosphere under conditions with variable water table depths potentially explains part of the frequently reported lack of correlation between environmental variables and trace gas fluxes in field investigations, and questions the applicability of predictions of gas flux based on empirical relationships established under stable average conditions.

AB Radiocarbon isotopes are increasingly being used to investigate the age and source of carbon released from peatlands. Here we use combined C-14 and delta C-13 measurements to determine the isotopic composition of soil and soil decomposition products [dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CO2 and CH4] in a peatland-riparian-stream transect, to establish the isotopic signature and potential connectivity between carbon pools. Sampling was conducted during two time periods in 2012 to investigate processes under different temperature, hydrological and flux conditions. Isotopic differences existed in the peatland and riparian zone soil organic matter as a result of the riparian depositional formation. The peatland had a mean radiocarbon age of 551 +/- A 133 years BP, with age increasing with depth, and delta C-13 values consistent with C3 plant material as the primary source. In contrast the riparian zone had a much older radiocarbon age of 1,055 +/- A 107 years BP and showed no age/depth relationship; delta C-13 in the riparian zone was also consistent with C3 plant material. With the exception of DOC in September, soil decomposition products were predominately > 100 %modern with C-14 values consistent with derivation from organic matter fixed in the previous 5 years. Emissions of CO2 and CH4 from the soil surface were also modern. In contrast, CO2 and CH4 evaded from the stream surface was older (CH4: 310-537 years BP, CO2: 36 years BP to modern) and contained a more complex mix of sources combining soil organic matter and geogenic carbon. The results suggest considerable vertical transport of modern carbon to depth within the soil profile. The importance of modern recently fixed carbon and the differences between riparian and stream isotopic signatures suggests that the peatland (not the riparian zone) is the most important source of carbon to stream water.

AB Yamulki and co-authors address in their recent publication the important issue of net emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from peatlands where land use conversion has taken place. In their case, they studied conversion to forestry versus peatland restoration after a first rotation of plantation forestry. They monitored soil-derived fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) using opaque chamber measurements on planted and unplanted control treatments (with or without drainage), and an unplanted plot within a restored (felled) block on former lowland raised bog. They propose that their measurements of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at these sites suggest that the total net GHG emissions, in 100 yr carbon dioxide equivalents, of the restored peat bog would be higher than that of the peat bog with trees. We believe there are a number of issues with the measurement, calculation and comparison of these greenhouse budgets that may invalidate this conclusion.

AB Rising global temperatures tied to increases in greenhouse gas emissions are impacting high latitude regions, leading to changes in vegetation composition and feedbacks to climate through increased methane (CH4) emissions. In subarctic peatlands, permafrost collapse has led to shifts in vegetation species on landscape scales with high spatial heterogeneity. Our goal was to provide a baseline for vegetation distribution related to permafrost collapse and changes in biogeochemical processes. We collected unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery at Stordalen Mire, Abisko, Sweden to classify vegetation cover types. A series of digital image processing routines were used to generate texture attributes within the image for the purpose of characterizing vegetative cover types. An artificial neural network (ANN) was developed to classify the image. The ANN used all texture variables and color bands (three spectral bands and six metrics) to generate a probability map for each of the eight cover classes. We used the highest probability for a class at each pixel to designate the cover type in the final map. Our overall misclassification rate was 32%, while omission and commission error by class ranged from 0% to 50%. We found that within our area of interest, cover classes most indicative of underlying permafrost (hummock and tall shrub) comprised 43.9% percent of the landscape. Our effort showed the capability of an ANN applied to UAS high-resolution imagery to develop a classification that focuses on vegetation types associated with permafrost status and therefore potentially changes in greenhouse gas exchange. We also used a method to examine the multiple probabilities representing cover class prediction at the pixel level to examine model confusion. UAS image collection can be inexpensive and a repeatable avenue to determine vegetation change at high latitudes, which can further be used to estimate and scale corresponding changes in CH4 emissions.

AB In this study, we compare annual fluxes of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and soil respiratory carbon dioxide (CO2) measured at nine European peatlands (n = 4) and shrublands (n = 5). The sites range from northern Sweden to Spain, covering a span in mean annual air temperature from 0 to 16 degrees C, and in annual precipitation from 300 to 1300 mm yr(-1). The effects of climate change, including temperature increase and prolonged drought, were tested at five shrubland sites. At one peatland site, the long-term (> 30 yr) effect of drainage was assessed, while increased nitrogen deposition was investigated at three peatland sites.
   The shrublands were generally sinks for atmospheric CH4, whereas the peatlands were CH4 sources, with fluxes ranging from -519 to + 6890 mg CH4-Cm-2 yr(-1) across the studied ecosystems. At the peatland sites, annual CH4 emission increased with mean annual air temperature, while a negative relationship was found between net CH4 uptake and the soil carbon stock at the shrubland sites. Annual N2O fluxes were generally small ranging from -14 to 42 mg N2O-Nm(-2) yr(-1). Highest N2O emission occurred at the sites that had highest nitrate (NO3-) concentration in the soil water. Furthermore, experimentally increased NO3- deposition led to increased N2O efflux, whereas prolonged drought and long-term drainage reduced the N2O efflux. Soil CO2 emissions in control plots ranged from 310 to 732 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1). Drought and long-term drainage from -519 to + 6890 mg CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1) across the studied ecosystems. At the peatland sites, annual CH4 emission increased with mean annual air temperature, while a negative relationship was found between net CH4 uptake and the soil carbon stock at the shrubland sites. Annual N2O fluxes were generally small ranging from -14 to 42 mg N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1). Highest N2O emission occurred at the sites that had highest nitrate (NO3-) concentration in the soil water. Furthermore, experimentally increased NO3- deposition led to increased N2O efflux, whereas prolonged drought and long-term drainage reduced the N2O efflux. Soil CO2 emissions in control plots ranged from 310 to 732 g CO2-Cm-2 yr(-1). Drought and long-term drainage generally reduced the soil CO2 efflux, except at a hydric shrubland where drought tended to increase soil respiration.
   In terms of fractional importance of each greenhouse gas to the total numerical global warming response, the change in CO2 efflux dominated the response in all treatments (ranging 71-96%), except for NO3- addition where 89% was due to change in CH4 emissions. Thus, in European peatlands and shrublands the effect on global warming induced by the investigated anthropogenic disturbances will be dominated by variations in soil CO2 fluxes.

AB Changes of water table position influence carbon cycling in peatlands, but effects on the sources and sinks of carbon are difficult to isolate and quantify in field investigations due to seasonal dynamics and covariance of variables. We thus investigated carbon fluxes and dissolved carbon production in peatland mesocosms from two acidic and oligotrophic peatlands under steady state conditions at two different water table positions. Exchange rates and CO2, CH4 and DOC production rates were simultaneously determined in the peat from diffusive-advective mass-balances of dissolved CO2, CH4 and DOC in the pore water. Incubation experiments were used to quantify potential CO 2, CH4, and DOC production rates. The carbon turnover in the saturated peat was dominated by the production of DOC (10 - 15 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) with lower rates of DIC (6.1 - 8.5 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and CH4 (2.2 - 4.2 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) production. All production rates strongly decreased with depth indicating the importance of fresh plant tissue for dissolved C release. A lower water table decreased area based rates of photosynthesis (24 - 42%), CH4 production ( factor 2.5 - 3.5) and emission, increased rates of soil respiration and microbial biomass C, and did not change DOC release. Due to the changes in process rates the C net balance of the mesocosms shifted by 36 mmol m(-2) d(-1). According to our estimates the change in C mineralization contributed most to this change. Anaerobic rates of CO2 production rates deeper in the peat increased significantly by a factor of 2 - 3.5 ( DOC), 2.9 - 3.9 (CO2), and 3 - 14 (CH4) when the water table was lowered by 30 cm. This phenomenon might have been caused by easing an inhibiting effect by the accumulation of CO2 and CH4 when the water table was at the moss surface.

AB Methane (CH4) emissions from drained organic soils are generally low, but internal gas transport in aerenchymatous plants may result in local emission hotspots. In a paired-sample field study at three different sites we measured fluxes of CH4 with static chambers from adjacent sampling quadrats with and without Juncus effusus during four field campaigns. At all three sites, CH4 was observed in the soil at all sampling depths (5 to 100 cm), and in most cases both above and below the groundwater table. During spring, local maxima suggested methanogenesis also took place above the water table at all three sites. We found significant CH4 emissions at all three sites, but emission controls were clearly different. Across the three sites, average emission rates (+/- 1 SE) for sampling quadrats with and without J. effusus were 1.47 +/- 0.28 and 1.37 +/- 0.33 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1), respectively, with no overall effect of J. effusus on CH4 emissions. However, a significant effect of J. effusus was seen at one of the three sites. At this site, local CH4 maxima were closer to the soil surface than at the other sites, and the upper soil layers were dryer. This could have affected both root CH4 accessibility and CH4 oxidation respectively, and together with limited gas diffusivity in the soil column, cause elevated CH4 emissions from J. effusus. We conclude that J. effusus has the potential to act as point sources of CH4 from drained peatlands, but more studies on the specific conditions under which there is an effect, are needed before the results can be used in modelling of CH4 emissions.

AB Warming-induced permafrost thaw could enhance microbial decomposition of previously stored soil organic matter (SOM) to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), one of the most significant potential feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in a changing climate. The environmental parameters regulating microbe-organic matter interactions and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in northern permafrost peatlands are however still largely unknown. The objective of this work is to understand controls on SOM degradation and its impact on porewater GHG concentrations across the Stordalen Mire, a thawing peat plateau in Northern Sweden. Here, we applied high-resolution mass spectrometry to characterize SOM molecular composition in peat soil samples from the active layers of aSphagnum-dominated bog and rich fen sites in the Mire. Microbe-organic matter interactions and porewater GHG concentrations across the thaw gradient were controlled by aboveground vegetation and soil pH. An increasingly high abundance of reduced organic compounds experiencing greater humification rates due to enhanced microbial activity were observed with increasing thaw, in parallel with higher CH(4)and CO(2)porewater concentrations. Bog SOM however contained moreSphagnum-derived phenolics, simple carbohydrates, and organic- acids. The low degradation of bog SOM by microbial communities, the enhanced SOM transformation by potentially abiotic mechanisms, and the accumulation of simple carbohydrates in the bog sites could be attributed in part to the low pH conditions of the system associated withSphagnummosses. We show that Gibbs free energy of C half reactions based on C oxidation state for OM can be used as a quantifiable measure for OM decomposability and quality to enhance current biogeochemical models to predict C decomposition rates. We found a direct association between OM chemical diversity and delta C-13-CH(4)in peat porewater; where higher substrate diversity was positively correlated with enriched delta C-13-CH(4)in fen sites. Oxidized sulfur-containing compounds, produced bySphagnum, were further hypothesized to control GHG emissions by acting as electron acceptors for a sulfate-reducing electron transport chain, inhibiting methanogenesis in peat bogs. These results suggest that warming-induced permafrost thaw might increase organic matter lability, in subset of sites that become wetlands, and shift biogeochemical processes toward faster decomposition with an increasing proportion of carbon released as CH4.

AB Herbivory is an important part of most ecosystems, and grazing alone can have a considerable impact on the ecosystems carbon balance with both direct and indirect effects. Removal of above-ground biomass by consumption of herbivores will change the below-ground carbon stock; the reduction of litter that goes into the ground will influence the total ecosystem carbon content. Little is however known about how plant-herbivory interactions effect the carbon balance, in particular methane emissions, of high arctic mires. We hypothesized that increased grazing pressure will change carbon allocation patterns resulting in decreased net ecosystem uptake of carbon and subsequently in lower methane emissions. An in-situ field experiment was conducted over 3 years in a high arctic mire at Zackenberg in NE Greenland. The experiment consisted of three treatments, with five replicates of each (1) control, (2) vascular plants were removed (NV), (3) clipped twice each growing season in order to simulate increased muskox grazing. Immediately after the initiation of the experiment net ecosystem uptake of CO2 decreased in clipped plots (mean total decrease for the three following years was 35 %). One year into the experiment a significantly lower CH4 emission was observed in these plots, the total mean reduction for the following 2 years was 26 %. Three years into the experiment significantly lower substrate (acetic acid) availability for CH4 production was observed (27 % reduction). NV plots had a mean decrease in CO2 uptake of 113 %, a 62 % decrease in ecosystem respiration and an 84 % decrease in CH4 emission (mean of all 3 years). Our study shows that increased grazing pressure in a high arctic mire can lead to significant changes in the carbon balance, with lower CO2 uptake leading to lower production of substrate for CH4 formation and in lower CH4 emission.

AB Future climate conditions (warmer, wetter) are expected to change aboveground plant communities with linked belowground alterations (e.g. porewater chemistry) that can influence carbon dynamics. The aims of this study were 1) to determine if porewater phenolic compound concentrations reflect the changing aboveground plant community and 2) to elucidate if changes in phenolic compounds alter belowground carbon release.
   We monitored the changes in vegetation biomass, porewater phenolic compound concentrations, respired CO2 and phenol oxidase enzyme activity in 84 intact peatland mesocosms exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2, elevated temperature, and decreased water table conditions in a full factorial design.
   Phenolic compound concentrations were indicative of the vascular plant expansion that occurred under warmer and anaerobic conditions, suggesting that phenolic compounds could be a simple indicator of northern plant community dynamics. Ecosystem CO2 respiration increased with rising phenolic compound concentrations, suggesting that phenolic compounds can decrease microbial carbon use efficiency in northern peatlands.
   Using an aboveground-belowground framework we present a previously unrecognized mechanism influencing northern carbon dynamics; wherein, climate change conditions can restructure the plant community composition in turn increasing porewater phenolic concentrations, which results in decreased microbial carbon use efficiency and enhanced carbon release.

AB Ecosystem respiration (R (eco) ) is controlled by thermal and hydrologic regimes, but their relative importance in defining the CO2 emissions in peatlands seems to be site specific. The aim of the paper is to investigate the sensitivity of R (eco) to variations in temperature and water table depth (WTD) in a wet, geogenous temperate peatland with a wide variety of vegetation community groups.
   The CO2 fluxes were measured using chambers. Measurements were made at four microsites with different vegetation communities and peat moisture and temperature conditions every 3 to 4 weeks during the period 2008-2009, 2 years with contrasting WTD patterns. Models were used to examine the relative response of each microsite to variations in peat temperature and WTD and used to estimate annual total R (eco) .
   Temporal variations in R (eco) were strongly related to peat temperature at the 5 cm depth. However, two of the microsites did not show any significant change in this relationship while two others showed contrasting responses including an increase and decrease in temperature sensitivity with deeper WTD. Average R (eco) varied among the microsites and tended to be greatest for those with greatest leaf area which also positively correlated with deeper WTD, ash content and degree of peat decomposition at 20 cm. A combined temperature and WTD model explained up to 94 % of the temporal variation in daily average R (eco) and was used to show that on an annual basis, R (eco) was between 5 and 18 % greater in the warmer year with deeper WTD.
   Microsite-specific responses were related to differences in vegetation and peat characteristics among microsites. R (eco) may have remained insensitive to WTD variations at one microsite due to the dominance of autotrophic respiration from abundant sedge biomass. At a Sphagnum-dominated microsite, a lack of response may have been due to relatively small variations in WTD that did not greatly influence microbial respiration or due to offsets between decreasing and increasing respiration rates in near-surface and deeper peat. The microsite with the most recalcitrant peat had reduced R (eco) sensitivity to temperature under more aerobic conditions while another microsite showed the opposite response, perhaps due to less nutrient availability during the wet year. Ultimately, micro-site specific models with both soil temperature and WTD as explanatory variables described temporal variations in R (eco) and highlighted the significant spatial variations in respiration rates that may occur within a single wetland.

Ecotopes had a significant impact on CO2 and CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere. Ecosystem respiration and CH4 emissions from the bare peat site, the constructed shallow lake and the open poor fen were low but were much higher from ecotopes with Eriophorum vaginatum tussocks and Eriophorum angustifolium. A combination of vascular plant cover and high soil temperatures enhanced ecosystem respiration, while a combination of vascular plant cover, high water table levels and high soil temperatures enhanced CH4 emissions. N2O emissions contributed little to total greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes from the soil-plant-water systems to the atmosphere. However, the overall climate impact of CH4 emissions from the study area did not exceed the impact of soil and plant respiration. With regard to management of extracted peatlands, the construction of a nutrient-poor shallow lake showed great potential for lowering GHG fluxes to the atmosphere.

AB The construction industry is a large contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. In recent years, the industry has begun to consider sustainability alongside technical merit, cost and programme when analysing construction options. Construction on peaty soils is challenging and often requires extensive ground improvement which can in itself be carbon intensive, while also generating further emissions where peat is removed. Stabilisation (soil mixing) is a ground improvement technique in which a soft soil such as peat is mixed with a cementitious binder in situ. While life cycle assessments have been carried out on soil mixing scenarios from cradle-to-site, the effect of the process on carbon stocks post construction has not been considered to date, hindering cradle-to-grave assessments. In this research, stabilised peat has been shown to be a small sink of CO2. An extensive laboratory study has investigated the key factors impacting carbonation rates (and thus CO2 intake rates) in stabilised peats. The study revealed that time and a greater surcharge magnitude contributed to a greater carbonation depth, while increased cement content and the presence of a high water table decreased carbonation depth. Carbonation k-rate factors exceed those typical of concrete. This quantitative evidence of the impact of peat stabilisation on embodied carbon levels post construction will enable geotechnical engineers to carry out more representative environmental appraisals of soil mixing schemes. In broader terms, data of this type are important in steering engineers and policy makers towards cleaner production and sustainable practices. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Drained peatlands in temperate Europe are a globally important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This article outlines a methodology to assess emissions and emission reductions from peatland rewetting projects using vegetation as a proxy. Vegetation seems well qualified for indicating GHG fluxes from peat soils as it reflects long-term water level, affects GHG emissions via assimilate supply and aerenchyma and allows fine-scaled mapping. The methodology includes mapping of vegetation types characterised by the presence and absence of species groups indicative for specific water level classes. GHG flux values are assigned to the vegetation types following a standardized protocol and using published emission values from plots with similar vegetation and water level in regions with similar climate and flora. Carbon sequestration in trees is accounted for by estimating the annual sequestration in tree biomass from forest inventory data. The method follows the criteria of the Voluntary Carbon Standard and is illustrated using the example of two Belarusian peatlands.

AB A process model based on kinetic principles was developed for methane fluxes from wetlands with gas-transporting plants and a fluctuating water table. Water dynamics are modeled with the 1-D Richards equation. For temperature a standard diffusion equation is used. The depth-dependent dynamics of methane oxygen, molecular nitrogen, carbon dioxide, soil carbon, electron accepters in oxidized and in reduced form are affected by transport processes and kinetic processes. Modeled transport processes are convection and diffusion in the soil matrix, ebullition, and plant-mediated gas transport. Modeled kinetic processes are carbon mineralization, aerobic respiration, methane production, methane oxidation, electron acceptor reduction, and electron acceptor reoxidation. Concentration gradients around gas-transporting roots in water-saturated soil are accounted for by the models from the two previous papers, ensuring an explicit connection between process knowledge at the kinetic level (millimeter scale) and methane fluxes at the plot scale. We applied the model to a fen, and without any fitting simulated methane fluxes are within I order of magnitude of measured methane fluxes. The seasonal variations however, are much weaket in the simulations compared to the measurements. Simulated methane fluxes are sensitive to several uncertain parameters such as the distribution over depth of carbon mineralization, the total pool size of reduced and oxidized electron accepters, and the root-shoot ratio. Because of the process-based character of the model it is probable that these sensitivities are present in reality as well, which explains why the measured variability is usually very high. Interestingly, heterogeneities within a rooted soil layer seem to be less important than heterogeneities between different soil layers. This is due to the strong influence of the interaction between water table and profile scale processes on the oxygen input to the system and hence on net methane production. Other existing process models are discussed and compared with the presented model.

AB We investigated the response Of CO2 and CH4 production to a water table fluctuation and a SO42- pulse in a bog mesocosm. Net gas production rates in the mesocosm were calculated from concentration data by diffusive mass-balances. Incubation experiments were used to quantify the effect of SO42- addition and the distribution of potential CO2 and CH4 production rates. Flooding of unsaturated peat resulted in rapid depletion of O-2 and complex patterns of net CH4, CO2, and H2S production. Methane production began locally and without a time lag at rates of 3-4 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) deeper in the peat. Similar rates were determined after a time lag of 10-60 days in the surface layers, whereas rates at lower depths declined. Net CO2 production was largest immediately after the water table position was altered (100-300 nmol cm(-3) d(-1)) and declined to -50-50 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) after a few weeks. SO42- addition (500 mM) significantly increased potential CH4 production rates in the surface layer from an average of 132-201 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) and reduced it below from an average of 418-256 nmol cm(-3) d(-1). Our results suggest that deeper in the peat (40-70 cm) under in situ conditions, methanogenic populations are less impaired by unsaturated conditions than in the surface layers, and that at these depths after flooding the substrate availability for CH4 and DIC production is significantly enhanced. They also suggest that methanogenic and SO42--reducing activity were non-competitive in the surface layer, which might explain contradictory findings from field studies.

AB Both peat utilization and peatlands themselves contribute to increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This article examines how peatlands with naturally high GHG emission levels affect net GHG emissions during the life cycle of peat. GHG emissions were measured from three drained peatland sites with high GHG emission levels. The impact of peatland type on the GHG emissions was considered when peat was assumed to replace coal in an energy production facility. The emission reduction levels achieved with the use of peat fuel originating from high-emission level peatlands stood at 35% compared to coal use and 30% compared to the average peat emission value. The findings indicate that GHG emissions can be reduced overall when peat from high-emission peatlands is utilized instead of coal. Lower emissions are primarily achieved because the harvesting of peat from high-emission level peatlands reduces the GHG emission levels of those lands.

AB The U.K. has extensive databases on soils, land cover and historic land use change which have made it possible to construct a comprehensive inventory of the principal terrestrial sources and sinks of carbon for approximately the year 1990, using methods that are consistent with, and at least as accurate as, the revised 1996 guidelines recommended by IPCC where available - and including categories which are not currently considered under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This country inventory highlights issues concerning methodology, uncertainty, double counting, the importance of soils and the relative magnitude of sources and sinks which are reported to the UNFCCC relative to other sources and sinks.
   The carbon sinks (negative values in MtC a(-1)) for categories reported to the UNFCCC, based on the IPCC categories, were estimated to be: forest trees and litter (-2.1), U.K. forest products (-0.5, ignoring imports and exports), non-forest biomass (-0.3), forest soils (-0.1) and soils on set-aside land (-0.4). The carbon sources (positive values) reported under the UNFCCC were estimated to be: losses of soil organic carbon resulting from cultivation of semi-natural land (6.2) and from urbanization (1.6), drainage of peatlands (0.3) and fenlands (0.5), and peat extraction (0.2). A range of other sources and sinks not covered by the IPCC guidelines were also quantified, namely, the accumulation of carbon in undrained peatlands (-0.7, ignoring methane emission), sediment accretion in coastal marshes (-0.1), the possible U.K. share of the CO2 and N fertilization carbon sink (-2.0) and riverine organic and particulate carbon export to the sea (1.4, which may be assumed to be a source if most of this carbon is released as CO2 in the sea). All sinks totalled -6.2 and sources 10.2, giving a net flux to the atmosphere in 1990 of 4.0 MtC a(-)1. Uncertainties associated with categories, mostly based on best guesses, ranged from +/-15% for forest biomass and litter to +/-60% for CO2 and N fertilization.

AB To evaluate the effects of increased air temperature in combination with increased deposition of N and/or S on methane emission. we have raised in situ the temperature and rates of deposition of N and S in a poor fen lawn area of a boreal mixed mire. The experiment was laid out in a factorial design, where the mean daily air temperature 0.3 In above the vegetation surface was increased (by 3.6 degreesC) using greenhouse enclosures. A significant increase in the cover of sedges was observed in the N-supplemented plots after the third year of treatment. All three experimental factors had significant effects on the methane emission. The effects of temperature and N deposition strongly interacted with the sedge cover, which was the single variable explaining most variation in methane emission. Raised temperature affected the emission positively when the sedge cover was high but showed no effect when the sedge cover was low. Nitrogen addition affected methane emission negatively when the sedge cover was high and had a zero or slightly positive effect at low sedge cover. These positive temperature and negative N interaction effects with sedge cover were likely due to changed biomass allocation patterns in the plants. The S additions had negative effects on methane emissions at ambient temperature but no effect at raised temperature. This interaction effect was possibly a result of different retention of S, since the total S concentration was higher in the S addition treatments at normal but not at raised temperature. The results stress the fact that a given variable may affect biogeochemical processes in different directions or to differing degrees depending on other variables. both experimental and natural. Most importantly, the effects of added nitrogen, but also of increased temperature. were critically dependent on the density of sedges.

A transect stretching from three forested upland sites to an open graminoid fen contained within a black spruce (OBS) palsa was compared with a similar transect from upland lichen and Sphagnum moss sites to wetland mire and pond sites adjacent to an active beaver pond (BP). Mean seasonal CH4 (dark CO2) fluxes were -0.51 (7.99), -0.14 (10.3), 0.15 (8.68), and 2.83 (8.22) mg/m(2)/d (g/m(2)/d) from the OBS feather moss, lichen, sphagnum moss, and fen sites. Mean seasonal CH4 (dark CO2) fluxes were -1.58 (9.16), 2.03 (7.62), 1144, and 153 mg/m(2)/d (g/m(2)/d) from the BP lichen, sphagnum moss, mire, and pond sites. Rates of CH4 oxidation typical of uplands were observed at all sites except for the BP mire and pond. CH4 efflux was observed in all sites. Rates varied by 4 orders of magnitude along the transition from the driest uplands to moist uplands to inundated wetlands. A high water table appears to be necessary for a strong CH4 source. Low soil temperatures inhibit high CH4 flux rates despite inundation. The potential for the conversion of upland sites from net sinks to sources of CH4 by minor changes in the water table was observed. Prediction of CH4 fluxes by plant community analysis appears to require knowledge of the thermal and hydrologic regime of particular sites over the course of the summer period. Dark CO2 fluxes, by contrast, appear more uniform across similar plant community types.

AB In northern peatlands with water tables at or near the surface, the Sphagnum moss layer is potentially the only aerobic region where CH, oxidation can occur. We hypothesized that mosses with varying physiologies would create different conditions for methane-oxidizing bacteria and, in turn, affect rates of CH, consumption. We measured in-vitro CH, consumption potential of Sphagnum magellanicum and Sphagnum capillifoliun taken from the same habitat and S. magellanicum and Sphagnum majus across habitats to compare and contrast species and environmental effects. In certain cases, S. capillifolium consumed CH, more rapidly than S. magellanicum taken from identical habitats, although the greatest difference in consumption rates between species was only 29 mug CH, g(-1) dry moss d(-1), compared to a maximum difference of 126 and 415 mug CH, g(-1) dry moss d(-1) in S. magellanicum and S. majus sampled from different habitats. In most cases, CH, was consumed most rapidly in the lower, non-photosynthetic portions of the Sphagnum mosses, and consumption potential increased with an increase in the concentration of CH, in the habitat. We hypothesize that CH, consumption occurred internally, likely in the hyaline cells, as external surface sterilization did not significantly alter CH, consumption rates. This work provides evidence that different Sphagnum moss species have variable ability to oxidize CH,, although inter-species differences are small compared to differences across habitats.

AB Purpose Peatlands have an important role in methane cycling in the natural environment. Methane emissions as a result of methanogenesis and methanotrophy in soil are affected by several environmental factors such as temperature, oxygen and groundwater level. The objective of this study was to analyse methane cycling as a function of soil depth.
   Materials and methods In this study, methane cycling and soil organic matter mineralization were investigated in a drained fen grassland area of Ljubljana marsh, Slovenia that has been subjected to reclamation strategies for several centuries. Potential mineralization, methane production and methane oxidation rates were measured in slurry incubation experiments with soil samples from 10 sampling depths of a 1-m profile. In addition, the extent of iron reduction in the soil was determined.
   Results and discussion The potential for methane production was low in the investigated soil profile, even in constantly flooded layers below the water table fluctuations. During anaerobic incubations, the highest accumulated concentrations and production rates of methane were observed in the upper 10-cm layer and the lowest in deeper soil layers, indicating that plant exudates are the main source of energy for heterotrophic soil microbes and that methanogenesis in deeper layers is limited by the availability of appropriate organic substrates. Methane oxidation was on the other hand active throughout the soil profile, suggesting that the potentially active methane oxidizing community is present despite low methane production. The highest abundance and activity of methanotrophs was detected in the water table fluctuation layers.
   Conclusions Together, these findings have implications for understanding the biogeochemical function of drained peat soils and emphasize the influence of drainage on quality of soil organic matter and consequently on methane production even in flooded soils.

AB A large amount of organic carbon is stored in high-latitude soils. A substantial proportion of this carbon stock is vulnerable and may decompose rapidly due to temperature increases that are already greater than the global average. It is therefore crucial to quantify and understand carbon exchange between the atmosphere and subarctic/arctic ecosystems. In this paper, we combine an Arctic-enabled version of the process-based dynamic ecosystem model, LPJ-GUESS (version LPJG-WHyMe-TFM) with comprehensive observations of terrestrial and aquatic carbon fluxes to simulate long-term carbon exchange in a subarctic catchment at 50m resolution. Integrating the observed carbon fluxes from aquatic systems with the modeled terrestrial carbon fluxes across the whole catchment, we estimate that the area is a carbon sink at present and will become an even stronger carbon sink by 2080, which is mainly a result of a projected densification of birch forest and its encroachment into tundra heath. However, the magnitudes of the modeled sinks are very dependent on future atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, comparisons of global warming potentials between two simulations with and without CO2 increase since 1960 reveal that the increased methane emission from the peatland could double the warming effects of the whole catchment by 2080 in the absence of CO2 fertilization of the vegetation. This is the first process-based model study of the temporal evolution of a catchment-level carbon budget at high spatial resolution, including both terrestrial and aquatic carbon. Though this study also highlights some limitations in modeling subarctic ecosystem responses to climate change, such as aquatic system flux dynamics, nutrient limitation, herbivory and other disturbances, and peatland expansion, our study provides one process-based approach to resolve the complexity of carbon cycling in subarctic ecosystems while simultaneously pointing out the key model developments for capturing complex subarctic processes.

AB Seasonal changes in soil respiration (SR), soil temperature (ST) and soil water content (SWC) were monitored in three different soil types (peat, sand and clay soils) in Finnish agricultural ecosystems. Rates of CO2 emission were measured by the closed chamber method using an infrared gas analyser (IRGA) at intervals of 2-3 weeks from May to October. The seasonal changes in SR were different among the soil types: peat soil, maximum rate (650 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)) in summer, positive significant relation between SR and ST and negative relation between SR and SWC; sandy soil, stable SR (300 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)) without seasonal changes, positive relation between SR and SWC and no significant relation between SR and ST; clay soil, maximum rate (500 mg CO2 m(-1) h(-1)) in summer, highly positive significant relation between SR and ST and negative relation between SR and SWC. A statistical model was developed to predict the amount of CO2 evolved from the cultivated soils based on the relationships between SR and certain abiotic environmental factors. The model calculation indicated that the amount of CO2 evolved from Finnish agricultural soils during the cultivation period was comparable to the values obtained from different locations around the world. These suggest that soils in northern crop fields release a relatively large amount of CO2, equivalent to that in regions with warm-temperate and temperate climates.

AB Rewetting of drained industrial peatlands may reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and promote recolonisation by peat forming plant species. We investigated carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) dynamics over a three-year period in a rewetted industrial peatland in Ireland. Sample plots were established in bare peat, Juncus effusus-Sphagnum cuspidatum, Sphagnum cuspidatum and Eriophorum angustifolium dominated microsites. The relationships between fluxes and environmental variables were examined and regression models were used to provide an estimate of the annual GHG balance for each microsite. All the vegetated microsites were carbon sinks for the duration of the study. Highest uptake occurred in the Eriophorum microsite (146-583 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), followed by Juncus-Sphagnum (35-204 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and Sphagnum (5-140 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The bare peat microsite was a source of 37-82 g C m(-2) yr(-1). No N2O fluxes were detected. Strong inter-annual variation was observed in all microsites, driven by variation in precipitation and subsequent changes in the position of the water table. In terms of Global Warming Potential (GWP), the microsites had either a cooling effect (Eriophorum), a close to neutral effect (Juncus-Sphagnum, Sphagnum) or a warming effect (bare peat) on the climate.

TI Methane emissions on large scales
SO ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID LANDSCAPE
AB Two separate studies have been undertaken to improve estimates of methane emissions on a landscape scale. The first study took place over a palsa mire in northern Finland in August 1995. A tethered balloon and a tunable diode laser were used to measure profiles of methane in the nocturnal boundary layer. Using a simple box method or the flux gradient technique fluxes ranging from 18.5 to 658 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) were calculated. The large fluxes may be caused by advection of methane pockets across the measurement site, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of methane source strengths in the surrounding area. Under suitable conditions, comparison with nearby ground-based eddy-correlation results suggested that the balloon techniques could successfully measure fluxes on field scales. The second study was carried out by the NERC Scientific Services Atmospheric Research Airborne Support Facility using the Hercules C130 operated by the United Kingdom Meteorological Research Flight. A flight path around the northern coastline of Britain under steady West-East wind conditions enabled the measurement of methane concentrations up- and down-wind of northern Britain. Using a simple one-dimensional, constant-source diffusion model, the difference between the upwind and downwind concentrations was accounted for by methane emission from the surface. The contribution to methane emissions from livestock was also modelled. Modelled non-agricultural methane emissions decreased with increasing latitude with fluxes in northern England being a factor of 4 greater than those in northern Scotland. Since the only major methane source in northern Scotland was peat bogs, these results indicated that emissions over northern England were dominated by anthropogenic sources. Emissions from livestock accounted for 12% of the total flux over northern England, decreasing to 4% in southern Scotland and becoming negligible in northern Scotland. The total methane flux over northern Scotland was consistent with previous results from the area, indicating that this method of data analysis provided good estimates of large scale methane emissions.

AB Net ecosystem exchange of CO2 was measured at a temperate peatland in southeastern New Hampshire. Classified as a mineral-poor fen owing to deep, water-logged peats that are influenced to a limited extent by groundwater, the ecosystem is dominated by plants such as sedges (Carex spp.) and evergreen shrubs. Ten automatic chambers measured fluxes every 3 h by sampling changes in headspace concentration of CO2 from November 2000 through March 2001. The fen was covered in snow for most of this period and CO2 was emitted from the snow pack throughout the winter. The largest fluxes were associated with ground temperatures of 0 degreesC and with declining atmospheric pressure. CO2 effluxes up to 3 mumol m(-2) s(-1) were recorded when the ground temperature reached the thaw point. Fluxes were lower when the ground temperature rose above 0 degreesC, however, suggesting that the large fluxes were associated with a build up and release of stored CO2 degassing as soon as the ground thawed, or by enhanced microbial activity associated with freeze-thaw dynamics. The large number of thaw events coupled with frequent short-term releases of CO2 suggest that degassing occurred on a regular basis with changes in atmospheric pressure and/or microbial decomposition occurred beneath the snowpack. The extent of soil freezing prior to thaw was also an important factor, with colder soils yielding smaller CO2 emissions upon thaw. Although most of the observed CO2 flux was efflux from the ecosystem, occasional CO2 uptake by the ecosystem of up to 1 mumol m(-2) s(-1) was also observed, indicating small rates of photosynthesis even during winter. Photosynthesis occurred only when the ground temperature was >0 degreesC. The implications for a warmer climate are unclear. If warmer winter temperatures yield less snow in the temperate region, then soils could freeze more deeply and result in lower CO2 emissions. However, if less snow results in a higher frequency of freeze-thaw events, then winter CO2 emissions could be larger with a warmer climate. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Rapidly rising temperatures in the Arctic might cause a greater release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere. To study the effect of warming on GHG dynamics, we deployed open-top chambers in a subarctic tundra site in Northeast European Russia. We determined carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes as well as the concentration of those gases, inorganic nitrogen (N) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) along the soil profile. Studied tundra surfaces ranged from mineral to organic soils and from vegetated to unvegetated areas. As a result of air warming, the seasonal GHG budget of the vegetated tundra surfaces shifted from a GHG sink of -300 to -198 g CO2 -eq m(-2) to a source of 105 to 144 g CO2 -eq m(-2). At bare peat surfaces, we observed increased release of all three GHGs. While the positive warming response was dominated by CO2, we provide here the first in situ evidence of increasing N2O emissions from tundra soils with warming. Warming promoted N2O release not only from bare peat, previously identified as a strong N2O source, but also from the abundant, vegetated peat surfaces that do not emit N2O under present climate. At these surfaces, elevated temperatures had an adverse effect on plant growth, resulting in lower plant N uptake and, consequently, better N availability for soil microbes. Although the warming was limited to the soil surface and did not alter thaw depth, it increased concentrations of DOC, CO2, and CH4 in the soil down to the permafrost table. This can be attributed to downward DOC leaching, fueling microbial activity at depth. Taken together, our results emphasize the tight linkages between plant and soil processes, and different soil layers, which need to be taken into account when predicting the climate change feedback of the Arctic.

AB Wetlands are one of the most significant natural sources of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. They emit CH4 because decomposition of soil organic matter in waterlogged anoxic conditions produces CH4, in addition to carbon dioxide (CO2). Production of CH4 and how much of it escapes to the atmosphere depend on a multitude of environmental drivers. Models simulating the processes leading to CH4 emissions are thus needed for upscaling observations to estimate present CH4 emissions and for producing scenarios of future atmospheric CH4 concentrations. Aiming at a CH4 model that can be added to models describing peatland carbon cycling, we composed a model called HIMMELI that describes CH4 build-up in and emissions from peatland soils. It is not a full peatland carbon cycle model but it requires the rate of anoxic soil respiration as input. Driven by soil temperature, leaf area index (LAI) of aerenchymatous peat-land vegetation, and water table depth (WTD), it simulates the concentrations and transport of CH4, CO2, and oxygen (O-2) in a layered one-dimensional peat column. Here, we present the HIMMELI model structure and results of tests on the model sensitivity to the input data and to the description of the peat column (peat depth and layer thickness), and demonstrate that HIMMELI outputs realistic fluxes by comparing modeled and measured fluxes at two peatland sites. As HIMMELI describes only the CH4-related processes, not the full carbon cycle, our analysis revealed mechanisms and dependencies that may remain hidden when testing CH4 models connected to complete peatland carbon models, which is usually the case. Our results indicated that (1) the model is flexible and robust and thus suitable for different environments; (2) the simulated CH4 emissions largely depend on the prescribed rate of anoxic respiration; (3) the sensitivity of the total CH4 emission to other input variables is mainly mediated via the concentrations of dissolved gases, in particular, the O-2 concentrations that affect the CH4 production and oxidation rates; (4) with given input respiration, the peat column description does not significantly affect the simulated CH4 emissions in this model version.

AB Climate change projections indicate increases in CO2 emissions and DOC release from peatlands, thereby potentially transforming them from sinks to carbon sources. The individual effects of abiotic and biotic factors on peatland carbon exports and the interactions among all these factors are still poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a field study over two years in a peatland complex by selecting four habitats differing in their dominant vegetation (shrub, grass, sedge and moss) in order to assess the links between abiotic and biotic factors and carbon release at each habitat. Accounting for the wide variability across habitats allowed us to examine the direct and indirect effects of abiotic and biotic factors on carbon cycling at the ecosystem level (i.e. the whole peatland complex). Results showed that the habitats dominated by vascular plants had the highest microbial and above-ground plant biomass, as well as the highest values of Acari and Collembola biomass, whereas Enchytraeidae biomass was dominant in the moss habitat. Furthermore, at ecosystem level, the SEM explained 75% of the total soil respiration variation and 33% of the DOC variation. Accordingly, soil respiration was directly linked to enchytraeid biomass, with these invertebrates being positively related to soil moisture. In contrast, both soil temperature and soil moisture had direct effects on microbial and Acari biomass, and the interaction between Acari biomass and below-ground plant biomass was responsible for DOC release. These findings provide new insights into the role of soil biota in carbon dynamics in peatlands, by showing that the direct effects of abiotic factors on biotic communities (both plants and soil organisms) determine how much carbon is lost from these systems (either as CO2 e or DOC).

AB Entrapped biogenic gas in peat can greatly affect peatland biogeochemical and hydrological processes by altering volumetric water content, peat buoyancy, and 'saturated' hydraulic conductivity, and by generating over-pressure zones. These over-pressure zones further affect hydraulic gradients which influence water and nutrient flow direction and rate. The dynamics of entrapped gas are of global interest because the loss of this gas to the atmosphere via ebullition (bubbling) is likely the dominant transport mechanism of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere from peatlands, which are the largest natural terrestrial source per annum of atmospheric CH4. We investigated the relationship between atmospheric pressure and temperature on volumetric gas content (VGC) and CH4 ebullition using a laboratory peat core incubation experiment.
   Peat cores were incubated at three temperatures (one core at 4 degrees C, three cores at 11 degrees C, and one core at 20 degrees C in sealed PVC cylinders, instrumented to measure VGC, pore-water CH4 concentrations, and ebullition (volume and CH4 concentrations). Ebullition events primarily occurred (71% of the time) during periods of falling atmospheric pressure. The duration of the drop in atmospheric pressure had a larger control on ebullition volume than the magnitude of the drop. VGC in the 20 degrees C core increased from the onset of the experiment and reached a fluctuating but time-averaged constant level between experiment day 30 and 115. The chance in VGC was low for the 11 degrees C cores for the initial period of the experiment but showed large increases when the growth chamber temperature increased to 20 degrees C due to a malfunction. The core maintained at 4 degrees C showed only a small increase in entrapped gas content throughout the experiment. The 20 degrees C core showed the largest increase in VGC. The increases in VGC occurred despite pore-water concentrations of CH4 being below the equilibrium solubility level. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We measured methane (CH4) exchange rates with automatic chambers at the forest floor of a nutrient-rich drained peatland in 2011-2013. The fen, located in southern Finland, was drained for forestry in 1969 and the tree stand is now a mixture of Scots pine, Norway spruce, and pubescent birch. Our measurement system consisted of six transparent chambers and stainless steel frames, positioned on a number of different field and moss layer compositions. Gas concentrations were measured with an online cavity ring-down spectroscopy gas analyzer. Fluxes were calculated with both linear and exponential regression. The use of linear regression resulted in systematically smaller CH4 fluxes by 10-45% as compared to exponential regression. However, the use of exponential regression with small fluxes (<2.5 mu gCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) typically resulted in anomalously large absolute fluxes and high hour-to-hour deviations. Therefore, we recommend that fluxes are initially calculated with linear regression to determine the threshold for "low" fluxes and that higher fluxes are then recalculated using exponential regression. The exponential flux was clearly affected by the length of the fitting period when this period was <190 s, but stabilized with longer periods. Thus, we also recommend the use of a fitting period of several minutes to stabilize the results and decrease the flux detection limit. There were clear seasonal dynamics in the CH4 flux: the forest floor acted as a CH4 sink particularly from early summer until the end of the year, while in late winter the flux was very small and fluctuated around zero. However, the magnitude of fluxes was relatively small throughout the year, ranging mainly from -130 to +100 mu gCH(4) m(-2) h(-1). CH4 emission peaks were observed occasionally, mostly in summer during heavy rainfall events. Diurnal variation, showing a lower CH4 uptake rate during the daytime, was observed in all of the chambers, mainly in the summer and late spring, particularly in dry conditions. It was attributed more to changes in wind speed than air or soil temperature, which suggest that physical rather than biological phenomena are responsible for the observed variation. The annual net CH4 exchange varied from -104 +/- 30 to -505 +/- 39 mg CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) among the six chambers, with an average of -219 mg CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) over the 2-year measurement period.

AB Rewetting by beaver is reported from many European peatlands and especially from Belarus, which harbours vast abandoned peat extraction sites and a large beaver population. We studied how vegetation and exchange rates of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) changed after beaver had rewetted an abandoned drained fen in Belarus. We selected three sites with different vegetation and water levels. One meadow site turned into a nutrient-poor lake that remained virtually free of living vascular plants, released CO2 and CH4, and was a moderate source of greenhouse gases (GHG). In another meadow site that became shallowly flooded, the died-off vegetation was quickly replaced by mire plant species and in the second year the site had already become a strong CO2 sink, a moderate CH4 source and, as a result, a strong carbon sink and a weak net GHG emitter. The third site was dominated by forbs that died after intermittent flooding and were only slowly and sparsely replaced by wetland species. This site was a strong source of CO2 and N2O. Beaver activity can restore a peatland's carbon sink and reduce GHG emissions. However, as for humaninduced rewetting, the outcome depends on starting conditions, position and constancy of the water level, and the time needed for establishment of peat forming vegetation.

AB Permafrost melting is occurring in areas of the boreal forest region where large amounts of carbon ( C) are stored in organic soils. We measured soil respiration, net CO2 flux, and net CH4 flux during May - September 2003 and March 2004 in a black spruce lowland in interior Alaska to better understand how permafrost thaw in poorly drained landscapes affects land-atmosphere CO2 and CH4 exchange. Sites included peat soils underlain by permafrost at similar to 0.4 m depth ( permafrost plateau, PP), four thermokarst wetlands ( TW) having no permafrost in the upper 2.2 m, and peat soils bordering the thermokarst wetlands having permafrost at similar to 0.5 m depth ( thermokarst edges, TE). Soil respiration rates were not significantly different among the sites, and 5-cm soil temperature explained 50 - 91% of the seasonal variability in soil respiration within the sites. Groundcover vegetation photosynthesis ( calculated as net CO2 minus soil respiration) was significantly different among the sites ( TW > TE > PP), which can be partly attributed to the difference in photosynthetically active radiation reaching the ground at each site type. Methane emission rates were 15 to 28 times greater from TW than from TE and PP. We modeled annual soil respiration and groundcover vegetation photosynthesis using soil temperature and radiation data, and CH4 flux by linear interpolation. We estimated all sites as net C gas sources to the atmosphere ( not including tree CO2 uptake at PP and TE), although the ranges in estimates when accounting for errors were large enough that TE and TW may have been net C sinks.

DT Article
ID COMBUSTION PRODUCTS; STABILIZATION; HYDROXIDE
AB In this study, a novel peat composite construction material suitable for three-dimensional printing of entire house boxes (walls, floors, ceilings, etc.) was developed. Peat was used as filler to achieve excellent thermal properties. Using peat for this purpose has not been mentioned in the earlier literature because it retarding properties to the cementation process. Asa binder, combustion fly ash was used. The retarding properties of peat humic substances on hardening of pozzolanic mixtures were successfully overcome by using silica fume as an additive. The same additive also greatly improved the long setting time of oil shale ash. The mechanism of hardening of the composite material was hypothesized as the following: first, upon contact with water, the pH of pore water exceeded 13 due to the high content of oxides of alkali metals in the ash, which promoted the oxidation of humates into oxalate. Then, alkali metal, aluminum and silicate ions (the latter mostly originating from silica fume) with alumina formed insoluble feldspars leading to a decrease in pH. At pH values lower than 12.4, Ca(OH)(2) became soluble and Ca2+ ions migrated to the liquid phase, allowing pozzolanic reactions to occur and calcium oxalate to precipitate. Finally, the residual Ca(OH)(2) reacted with atmospheric CO2 to form CaCO3. Test samples were 3D-printed using experimental apparatus, the printing head involved a nozzle delivering wet peat-ash mixture using compressed air. The material was characterized by measuring its thermal resistance (<0.08 W/(m K)), compressive and bending strengths (1.2 MPa and 0.36 N/mm(2), respectively). Using peat composites in the construction industry allows reducing CO2 emissions from partially mined peatlands (currently the one of the largest contributors to the total CO2 emission from Estonia) and increasing the reuse of oil shale ash while providing a cheap and affordable raw material.

AB Presented is a detailed comparison of CH4 and delta C-13-CH4 measurements with simulations of the global transport model TM3. Experimental data were obtained during campaigns along the Trans-Siberian railroad in the framework of the TROICA project. Two summer (1999 and 2001) and one spring (2003) expeditions are evaluated. Model simulations include sensitivity tests to further investigate the isotopic composition of natural gas and emissions from Siberian wetlands. Comparison of the average mixing ratio of methane and its isotopic composition (delta C-13) has been performed for different geographic zones, including the European part of Russia, Western Siberia and Central Siberia. Simulations are in reasonable agreement with the measurements for the European part of Russia and confirm a high contribution of natural gas to the observed methane levels. An increase of emission from bogs shifts the simulated methane isotopic composition closer to the observations. The relative importance of the Western Siberia emissions in current inventories is underestimated in comparison with other wetland regions in the former USSR. Simulated average mixing ratios are in a good agreement with the observations in Central Siberia, while C-13(CH4) values tend to be higher than measured in all considered scenarios. These results point to a bias in the modeled source mixture over Russia, which could be repaired by shifting emissions from isotopically heavy methane sources (e.g. coal, oil or biomass burning) to light sources (e.g. wetlands, ruminants, waste treatment). Alternatively, the average isotopic signature of Siberian wetlands may be lighter than expected.

AB Methane (CH4) is the most important greenhouse gas next to CO2 and as such it contributes to the enhanced greenhouse effect. Feat soils are often considered as sources of CH4. Grasslands on the other hand are generally considered to be a net sink for atmospheric CH4. The aim of this study was twofold: (i) to quantify the net CH4 emission of intensively managed grasslands on peat soil in the Netherlands; and (ii) to assess the effects of grassland management, i.e. drainage, nitrogen (N) fertilization, and grazing versus mowing, on CH4 emission rates. Net CH4 emissions were measured weekly or biweekly for one year with vented closed flux chambers at two sites, one with a mean ground water level of 22 cm below surface and one with a mean ground water level of 42 cm. On each site there were three treatments: mowing without N application, mowing with N application, and grazing with N application. The dominating species was perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Net CH4 emissions were low, in general in the range of -0.2 to 0.2 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). In the relatively warm summer of 1994, consumption of atmospheric CH4 peaked at 0.4 mg m(-2) d(-1). On an annual basis, the sites were net consumers of atmospheric CH4. However, the consumption was small: 0.31 to 0.08 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1). Effect of mean ground water level was significant, but small. There were no significant effects of withholding N fertilization for some years and grazing versus mowing on net CH4 emissions. We conclude that grassland management of intensively managed grasslands on peat soil is not a suitable tool for reducing net CH4 emissions.

AB We quantified the relationship between water table position and CO2 emissions by manipulating water table levels for two summers in microcosms installed in a Colorado subalpine fen. Water levels were manipulated in the microcosms by either adding water or removing water and ranged from +10 cm above the soil surface to 40 cm below the soil surface, with ambient water levels in the fen averaging +3 and +2 cm above the soil surface during 1998 and 1999, respectively. Microcosm installation had no significant effect on CO2 efflux; the 2 year means of natural and reference CO2 efflux were 205.4 and 213.9 mg CO2-C m(-2) h(-1), respectively (p = 0.80). Mean CO2 emissions were lowest at the highest water tables (water +6 to +10 cm above the soil surface), averaging 133.8 mg CO2-C m(-2) h(-1), increased to 231.3 mg CO2-C m(2) h(-1) when the water table was +1 to +5 cm above the soil surface and doubled to 453.7 Mg CO2-C m(-2) h(-1), when the water table was 0-5 cm below the soil surface. However, further lowering of the water table had little additional effect on CO2 emissions, which averaged 470.3 and 401.1 Mg CO2-C m(-2) h(-1) when the water table was 6-10 cm, and 11-40 cm beneath the soil surface, respectively. The large increase in CO2 emissions as we experimentally lowered the water table beneath the soil surface, coupled with no increase in CO2 emissions as we furthered lowered water tables beneath the soil surface, suggest the presence of an easily oxidized labile carbon pool near the soil surface.

AB We simulated the effect of prolonged dry summer periods by lowering the water table on three manipulation plots (D1-3) in a minerotrophic fen in southeastern Germany in three years (2006-2008). The water table at this site was lowered by drainage and by excluding precipitation; three nonmanipulated control plots (C1-3) served as a reference. We found no significant differences in soil respiration (R-Soil), gross primary production (GPP), or aboveground respiration (R-AG) between the C1-3 and D1-3 plots in any of the measurement years. The water table on the control plots was naturally low, with a median water table (2006-2008) of 8 cm below the surface, and even lower during summer when respiratory activity was highest, with median values (C1-3) between 11 and 19 cm below the surface. If it is assumed that oxygen availability in the uppermost 10 cm was not limited by the location of the water table, manipulative lowering of the water table most likely increased oxygen availability only in deeper peat layers where we expect R-Soil to be limited by poor substrate quality rather than anoxia. This could explain the lack of a manipulation effect. In a second approach, we estimated the influence of the water table on R-Soil irrespective of treatment. The results showed a significant correlation between R-Soil and water table, but with R-Soil decreasing at lower water tables rather than increasing. We thus conclude that decomposition in the litter layer is not limited by waterlogging in summer, and deeper peat layers bear no significant decomposition potential due to poor substrate quality. Consequently, we do not expect enhanced C losses from this site due to increasing frequency of dry summers. Assimilation and respiration of aboveground vegetation were not affected by water table fluctuations between 10 and >60 cm depth, indicating the lack of stress resulting from either anoxia (high water table) or drought (low water table).

AB A field experimental study has been performed in a drained cropped peatland located in the Zennare Basin (south of the Venice Lagoon, Italy), to measure land subsidence due to peat oxidation and to address the primary relationships between the hydrological regime, the soil mass loss (in form of CO2 efflux to the atmosphere), and the settlement rate. The latter, of the order of 0.01-0.02 m/a, has been proved to be related to soil CO2 efflux due to organic matter oxidation. A series of CO2 emission measurement campaigns has been performed between the years 2003 and 2005. The non-steady-state chamber method was employed to assess the efflux spatial variability and detect its relationship with the main hydrological parameters controlling the oxidation reaction, i.e., soil temperature, soil moisture, and organic matter content. The measurements, carried out in two sites located 1.5 km apart, point out a great variability of the CO2 emissions both in space and time. While the time-dependent behavior can be explained by the seasonal fluctuation of soil temperature, spatial variability shows a weak correlation with the variation of environmental variables. Statistical data analyses show that CO2 efflux can be considered lognormally distributed and that the process is stationary within each site but not in the whole basin, though the properties of the outcropping peat layer and the soil surface seem apparently uniform. A geostatistical analysis reveals two different spatial correlation structures, with scales of spatial dependence of approximate to 30 m and approximate to 180 m. Finally, the collected data show that invasive agricultural practices such as deep plowing, tilling, and harrowing, largely used in the Zennare Basin, induce significant disturbances that are not easily recognizable during the flux surveys and that casually affect the temporal and spatial variability of the oxidation process.

AB Water table decline is a major threat to soil organic carbon in peatlands worldwide principally because it may largely increase soil CO2 emission (SCE). This study is to determine the response of SCE to water table decline in the Zoige peatland of Tibetan Plateau, which has experienced rapid decline of water table due to climate change and anthropogenic drainage. We conducted a field in situ drainage experiment consisting of low (plots surrounded by 50 cm deep ditches), intermediate (20 cm deep) and high (intact) water table levels. The experiment lasted for about four years, during which we measured SCE rate and associated variables including soil temperature and moisture with a higher frequency in the growing season (May-September) than the non-growing season (October-April). Experimental drainage decreased water table height by ca. 12 cm and 15 cm (relative to the intact) and soil moisture (at 5 cm soil) by 6% and 12% (relative to 45% in the intact) on average in intermediate and low water table treatments, respectively, but it did not affect soil temperature during the experimental years.
   The effect of drainage on SCE varied with season. In the non-growing season, the drainage effect was nonsignificant in each measurement possibly because the low-temperature effect overrode the drainage effect on SCE. In the growing season, the drainage mostly increased the emission except for several cases, in which a negative effect was observed. The negative effect of drainage could be due to the low soil moisture (< 25%) in the drained treatments. Provided that the magnitude and the duration of the SCE increase were greater than those of the decrease, it can be estimated that drainage increased SCE by 17% and 20% on average in the low and the intermediate water table treatments, respectively, over the experimental years. Our results suggest that water table decline may facilitate net carbon emission and hence decrease soil carbon storage in the Zoige peatland. We call for artificial filling of the ditches that were historically created by both human beings and storm waters to increase water table in the Zoige peatland.

AB Meeting environmental, economic, and societal targets in energy policy is complex and requires a multicriteria assessment framework capable of exploring trade-offs among alternative energy options. In this study, we integrated economic analysis and biophysical accounting methods to investigate the performance of electricity production in Finland at plant and national level. Economic and environmental costs of electricity generation technologies were assessed by evaluating economic features (direct monetary production cost), direct and indirect use of fossil fuels (GER cost), environmental impact (CO2 emissions), and global environmental support (emergy cost). Three scenarios for Finland's energy future in 2025 and 2050 were also drawn and compared with the reference year 2008. Accounting for an emission permit of 25 (sic)/t CO2, the production costs calculated for CHP, gas, coal, and peat power plants resulted in 42, 67, 68, and 74 (sic)/MWh, respectively. For wind and nuclear power a production cost of 63 and 35 E /MWh were calculated. The sensitivity analysis confirmed wind power's competitiveness when the price of emission permits overcomes 20 (sic)/tCO(2). Hydro, wind, and nuclear power were characterized by a minor dependence on fossil fuels, showing a GER cost of 0.04, 0.13, and 0.26 J/Je, and a value of direct and indirect CO2 emissions of 0.01, 0.04, and 0.07 t CO2/MWh. Instead, peat, coal, gas, and CHP plants showed a GER cost of 4.18, 4.00, 2.78, and 2.33J/Je. At national level, a major economic and environmental load was given by CHP and nuclear power while hydro power showed a minor load in spite of its large production. The scenario analysis raised technological and environmental concerns due to the massive increase of nuclear power and wood biomass exploitation. In conclusion, we addressed the need to further develop an energy policy for Finland's energy future based on a diversified energy mix oriented to the sustainable exploitation of local, renewable, and environmentally friendly energy sources.

AB Alternate wetting and drying (AWD), has gained increasing attention as a promising strategy for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in flooded rice systems. AWD involves periodic drainage of rice paddies in order to inhibit methane (CH4) emissions. To date, studies evaluating this practice have been limited in their scope and resolution. Our study evaluates the mitigation potential of AWD from a life cycle perspective using highresolution CH4 modeling tomore accurately estimate themitigation potential of this practice. We simulated California rice production under continuous flooding and under five AWD schedules ranging in the severity and frequency of dry-downs. Production models were coupled with the Peatland Ecosystem Photosynthesis Respiration and Methane Transport (PEPRMT) model to simulate CH4 fluxes at daily intervals. We then evaluated the GHG mitigation potential of AWD using life cycle assessment models. Frequent or severe dry-downs reduced simulated grain yields, which negated some of the benefits of AWD when assessed on a yield-scaled basis. We also found AWD-induced mitigation of CH4 emissions modeled with PEPRMT to be roughly half the magnitude reported from up-scaling of chamber measurements, highlighting the importance of high resolution field data to better characterize GHGs in rice systems. Reduced yields and conservative CH4 mitigation in ourmodel lessened the overallmitigation potential of AWD. When the entire rice life cycle was considered, mitigation of overall global warming potential (GWP) was further reduced by the presence of additional GHGsources, which comprised roughly half of life cycle GWP. Our simulations resulted in <= 12% reductions inGWPkg-1 across all AWDscenarios and saw an increase in GWPwhen yields were severely reduced. Our results highlight the importance of constraining uncertainties in CH4 emissions and considering a life cycle perspective expressed on a yield-scaled basis in characterizing themitigation potential of AWD.

AB A process-based model was developed and validated to predict the regional dynamics of the water table (WT) in peatlands under climatic forcing. The model detailed the water-energy feedbacks in the common SVAT (soil-vegetation-atmosphere transportation) model and specified the differences in processes in pristine fens, pristine bogs and drained peatlands. The spatiotemporal changes in the WT of the peatlands throughout Finland were computed based on 10 km x 10 km grids for the period 2000-2099. The calculations used country-scale data on vegetation, catchment topography and profiles of peat bulk density and water content in the three mire types. Furthermore, the ACCLIM climate scenarios representing the current climate and the changing climate were used to identify the climatic impacts on the WT throughout Finland.
   Sensitivity analysis showed that the WT drawdown in pristine fens was most sensitive to increases in temperature and/or decreases in precipitation, whereas the WT drawdown in drained peatlands was the most resistant to such changes. For all three mire types, a 10% increase in precipitation based on the current climate tended to offset the effect of a 2 degrees C warming on WT drawdown and a 20% increase in precipitation tended to offset the WT drawdown caused by a 6 degrees C warming. Based on the ACCLIM climate scenario, the model showed moderate changes in the annual values of the WT, which ranged from +0.2 +/- 1.5 to -4.3 +/- 0.93 cm. The changes were most noticeable during the period 2060-2099. The drawdown was more pronounced in late spring than in summer and autumn. Additionally, the WT drawdown was most significant in the western parts of the northern aapa-mire region, where the peatlands were mostly pristine, and the increase of precipitation was more limited than in other parts of the country. These results show that the pronounced spatiality and temporality in the WT changes should be considered in studies addressing how climate change will affect mire ecosystems in terms of C balance and GHG emissions.

AB Exogenous nitrogen (N) and sulfate (SO42-), resulting from human activity, can strongly influence the emission of CH4 and CO2 from soil ecosystems. Studies have reported the effects of N and SO42- on CH4 and CO2 emissions from inland peatlands and paddies. However, very few studies have presented year-round data on the effects of the addition of N and SO42- on CH4 and CO2 emissions in estuarine marshes. The effects of the addition of N and SW on the emission of CH4 and CO2 were investigated in a Cyperus malaccensis marsh in the high tidal flat of the Min River estuary of southeastern China from September 2014 to August 2015. Dissolved NH4Cl, KNO3, and K2SO4 were applied every month, in doses of 24 g N/SO42- yr(-1). The emission of CH4 and CO2 showed distinct monthly and seasonal variations. Compared with the control, the addition of NH4Cl and NH4NO3 + K2SO4 showed increases in CH4 fluxes (p < 0.05), while the effects of the addition of KNO3 and K2SO4 on CH4 were minor (p > 0.05). NH4CI had a positive impact on CO2 emissions (p < 0.01), while the addition of KNO3, K2SO4, and NH4NO3 K2SO4 had minor positive impacts, compared to the control (p > 0.05). Correlation analysis found that soil sulfate concentration, nitrogen availability and enzyme activity were the dominant factors influencing CH4 and CO2 variation. Our findings suggest that CH4 and CO2 emissions were influenced more by ammonium than by nitrate. We propose that the suppressive effect of additional sulfate on CH4 production is insignificant, due to which the inhibition may be overestimated in the estuarine brackish marsh.

   technique; soil temperature
AB Methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission was measured from mires in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China, by using a static chamber technique during free snow-covered periods. The seasonal mean emission of CH4 was 12.4mg/(m(2).h) and the emission range of CO2 was 8.7-16.6g/(m(2).d) (gross CO2 flux) during plant growth period. CO2 emission rate in the day was stronger than that at night, and the daily peak appears at 19:00. The mire plants in the Sanjiang Plain begin to sprout at the end of April. The aboveground biomass of the mire plants increased from zero to the peak from July to September and showed single peak form. The aboveground biomass of Carex lasiocarpa (464.8g/m(2)) was lower than that of Deyeuxia platyphylla (530.8g/m(2)), but the underground biomass was higher than that of Deyeuxia platyphylla. Gross CO2 flux showed the significance positive correlation relationship with plant biomass. Gross CO2 flux and CH4 emission were also correlated with soil temperature (0-5cm) and water temperature. However, the highest CH4 emission rate lagged behind the highest soil temperature in the root area during plant growth period. The data also indicated that wet and warm conditions during the early spring led to greater value of CH4 emission flux. Inundation is the necessary condition for the existence of methane bacteria, but there is no significant positive correlation between the inundation depth and CH4 emission rate in this region. Within the same growing season and under the same inundation condition, the variations of CH4 emission rate could be markedly different.

AB Drained peatlands are considered to be insignificant CH4 sources, but the effect of drainage on CH4 dynamics has not been extensively studied. We investigated seasonal dynamics of CH4 in two fen peat soils and one bog peat soil under permanent grassland in Denmark.
   Soil CH4 concentrations were measured several times throughout the year in parallel to a one year CH4 flux monitoring campaign with static chambers. Additionally, CH4 production potentials were determined in a laboratory incubation assay for the bog soil.
   Methane fluxes were generally negligible, even though soil CH4 concentrations of up to 155 and 1000 mu mol CH4 dm(-3) were measured in one of the fen peats and in the bog peat, respectively. Significant CH4 concentrations were observed above the water table. Methane production assays confirmed the presence of viable methanogens in the upper parts of the bog peat soil. The aerenchymous plant Juncus effusus L. liberated CH4 from the peat at rates of up to 3.3 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). No CH4 dynamics were observed in the second fen peat which, in contrast to the other two sites, had high sulfate concentrations.
   Peat type and the distribution of aerenchymous plants should be considered before dismissing grasslands on peat as CH4 sources.

DE QTP; wetland ecosystems; CH4 emission; spatiality and seasonality;
   fluxes
AB The areal extent of cold freshwater wetlands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is estimated at 0.133 x 10(6) km(2), suggesting a significant methane potential. Methane fluxes from wet alpine meadows, peatlands, Hippuris vulgaris mires and secondary marshes were 43.18, 12.96, -0.28 and 45.90 mg.m(-2).d(-1), respectively based on the transect flux studies at the Huashixia Permafrost Station (HPS) from July to August 1996. Average CH4 fluxes in the thaw season were extrapolated at 5.68 g.m(-2) according to the areal percentage of wetland areas in the Huashixia region. The CH4 fluxes at four fixed sites, representative of similar ecosystems, ranged from - 19.384-347.15 mg.m(-2). d(-1), and the average CH4 fluxes varied from 6.54 to 71.97 mg.m(-2).d(-1) at each site during the observation period from April to September 1997. The CH4 emissions at each site during the entire thaw season was estimated from 1.21 to 10.65 g.m(-2), displaying strong spatial variations. Seasonal variations of CH4 fluxes also were observed at four sites: CH4 outbursts occurred upon the spring thaw in May and June, CH4 fluxes increased afterwards with rising soil temperatures. Episodic fluxes were observed in summer, which influenced the average CH4 fluxes considerably. Annual CH4 emissions from cold wetlands on the QTP were estimated at about 0.7-0.9 Tg based on the distribution of wetlands, representative CH4 fluxes, and number of thaw days. The centers of CH4 releasing were located in the sources of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, and Zoige Peatlands.

AB Predicted daily fluxes from an ecosystem model for water, carbon dioxide, and methane were compared with 1994 and 1996 Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) field measurements at sites dominated by old black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) (OBS) and boreal fen vegetation near Thompson, Man. Model settings for simulating daily changes in water table depth (WTD) for both sites were designed to match observed water levels, including predictions for two microtopographic positions (hollow and hummock) within the fen study area. Water run-on to the soil profile from neighboring microtopographic units was calibrated on the basis of daily snowmelt and rainfall inputs to reproduce BOREAS site measurements for timing and magnitude of maximum daily WTD for the growing season. Model predictions for daily evapotranspiration rates closely track measured fluxes for stand water loss in patterns consistent with strong controls over latent heat fluxes by soil temperature during nongrowing season months and by variability in relative humidity and air temperature during the growing season. Predicted annual net primary production (NPP) for the OBS site was 158 g C.m(-2) during 1994 and 135 g C.m(-2) during 1996, with contributions of 75% from overstory canopy production and 25% from ground cover production. Annual NPP for the wetter fen site was 250 g C.m(-2) during 1994 and 270 g C.m(-2) during 1996. Predicted seasonal patterns for soil CO2 fluxes and net ecosystem production of carbon both match daily average estimates at the two sites. Model results for methane flux, which also closely match average measured flux levels of -0.5 mg CH4.m(-2). day(-1) for OBS and 2.8 mg CH4.m(-2). day(-1) for fen sites, suggest that spruce areas are net annual sinks of about -0.12 g CH4.m(-2), whereas fen areas generate net annual emissions on the order of 0.3-0.85 g CH4.m(-2), depending mainly on seasonal WTD and microtopographic position. Fen hollow areas are predicted to emit almost three times more methane during a given year than fen hummock areas. The validated model is structured for extrapolation to regional simulations of interannual trace gas fluxes over the entire North America boreal forest, with integration of satellite data to characterize properties of the land surface.

AB Peatlands play an important role in global carbon cycling, but their responses to long-term anthropogenically changed hydrologic conditions and nutrient infiltration are not well known. While experimental manipulation studies, e.g., fertilization or water table manipulations, exist on the plot scale, only few studies have addressed such factors under in situ conditions. Therefore, an ecological gradient from the center to the periphery of a continental Canadian peatland bordering a eutrophic water reservoir, as reflected by increasing nutrient input, enhanced water level fluctuations, and increasing coverage of vascular plants, was used for a case study of carbon cycling along a sequence of four differently altered sites. We monitored carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) surface fluxes and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CH4 concentrations in peat profiles from April 2014 through September 2015. Moreover, we studied bulk peat and pore-water quality and we applied delta C-13-CH4 and delta C-13-CO2 stable isotope abundance analyses to examine dominant CH4 production and emission pathways during the growing season of 2015. We observed differential responses of carbon cycling at the four sites, presumably driven by abundances of plant functional types and vicinity to the reservoir. A shrub-dominated site in close vicinity to the reservoir was a comparably weak sink for CO2 (in 1.5 years: -1093 +/- 794, in 1 year: +135 +/- 281 g CO2 m(-2); a net release) as compared to two graminoid-moss-dominated sites and a moss-dominated site (in 1.5 years: -1552 to -2260 g CO2 m(-2), in 1 year: -896 to -1282 g CO2 m(-2)). Also, the shrub-dominated site featured notably low DIC pore-water concentrations and comparably C-13-enriched CH4 (delta C-13-CH4: -57.81 +/- 7.03 parts per thousand) and depleted CO2 (delta C-13-CO2: -15.85 +/- 3.61 parts per thousand) in a more decomposed peat, suggesting a higher share of CH4 oxidation and differences in predominant methanogenic pathways. In comparison to all other sites, the graminoid-moss-dominated site in closer vicinity to the reservoir featured a similar to 30% higher CH4 emission (in 1.5 years: +61.4 +/- 32, in 1 year: +39.86 +/- 16.81 g CH4 m(-2)). Low delta C-13-CH4 signatures (-62.30 +/- 5.54 parts per thousand) indicated only low mitigation of CH4 emissions by methanotrophic activity here. Pathways of methanogenesis and methanotrophy appeared to be related to the vicinity to the water reservoir: the importance of acetoclastic CH4 production apparently increased toward the reservoir, whereas the importance of CH4 oxidation increased toward the peatland center. Plant-mediated transport was the prevailing CH4 emission pathway at all sites even where graminoids were rare. Our study thus illustrates accelerated carbon cycling in a strongly altered peatland with consequences for CO2 and CH4 budgets. However, our results suggest that long-term excess nutrient input does not necessarily lead to a loss of the peatland carbon sink function.

AB Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of methane flux from boreal wetlands makes prediction and up-scaling challenging, both within and among wetland systems. Drivers of methane production and emissions are also highly variable, making empirical model development difficult and leading to uncertainty in methane emissions estimates from wetlands. Previous studies have examined this problem using point-scale (static chamber method) and ecosystem-scale (flux tower methods) measurements, but few studies have investigated whether different processes are observed at these scales. We analyzed methane emissions from a boreal fen, measured by both techniques, using data from the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study. We sought to identify driving processes associated with methane emissions at two scales and explain diurnal patterns in emissions measured by the tower. The mean methane emission rates from flux chambers were greater than the daytime, daily mean rates measured by the tower, but the nighttime, daily mean emissions from the tower were often an order of magnitude greater than emissions recorded during the daytime. Thus, daytime measurements from either the tower or chambers would lead to a biased estimate of total methane emissions from the wetland. We found that the timing of nighttime emission events was coincident with the cooling and convective mixing within hollows, which occurred regularly during the growing season. We propose that diurnal thermal stratification in shallow pools traps methane by limiting turbulent transport. This methane stored during daytime heating is later released during evening cooling due to convective turbulent mixing.

AB Information about the annual carbon fluxes of fen and meadow ecosystems in alpine environments is rare. We studied the influence of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), plant green area index (GAI), soil temperature, and water-filled pore space (wfps) on the net CO2 emission at four alpine sites (one meadow and three fen sites) differing in water balance and plant community. Measurements over two years were made in the Eastern Alps, Austria, including two snow-free periods and two snow periods. During snow-free periods, net CO2 gain during daylight periods (NEElight, PAR > 0) depended on PAR and GAI. The net CO2 emission rate at night (R-tot, PAR = 0) was positively related to soil temperature, while low wfps reduced the carbon loss via R-tot of the meadow and driest fen study site but reinforced carbon loss of the wetter fen sites. Daily average ecosystem net CO, gain (NEEday) during snow-free periods (averaged over both years) at the meadow was 3.5 g CO2 m(-2)d(-1) and ranged from 1.5 to 3.4 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) at the fen sites. Mean average daily wintertime CO2 emission was low, being only -0.9 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) for meadow and between -0.2 and -0.7 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) for all fen sites. All sites function as significant annual net carbon sinks, with a net carbon gain from 50 to 121 g C m(-2) a(-1) (averaged over both years) irrespective of water balance. Our results indicate that these alpine fen sites that have built up a large carbon stock in the past do not gain a further carbon surplus compared with the meadow under the current climate.

AB The environmental impacts of the establishment and maintenance of lawn, including the production and use of various substrates, were analyzed by life cycle assessment (LCA). The project focused on comparing substrates with different peat and compost contents using pilot substrates and developed a calculation tool to optimize landscaping from an ecological perspective. The impact categories were climate change, aquatic eutrophication, acidification, and use of primary energy. Life cycle assessment methodology and ISO standards 14040 and 14044 were used. Two thousand tons of substrates per hectare of lawn area were assumed to be needed; this large amount explains the importance of the substrate properties for all of the impact categories. Degradation of peat was the most significant factor of the influence of climate; thus, the most effective means of reducing the impact of landscaping on climate is to replace peat with compost. Nitrous oxide and methane emissions were related to the use of compost, but most of these emissions will occur regardless of how the sludge or biowaste is treated. Ammonia emissions from composting were the most important factor for acidification. The significance of fuel consumption by machinery in lawn establishment and mowing was low. The high contents of N and P in compost-based substrates may lead to high nutrient emissions into water systems, which can have significant local impact. The tool helps optimize substrate contents to minimize the environmental effects. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2016;12:459-464. (c) 2016 SETAC

AB The purpose of this study was to monitor the dynamics of gases such as CO2 and CH4 in a soil profile with sufficient temporal resolution to observe possible diurnal variations. A computer-controlled device called a membrane probes array (MPA) was developed that consisted of 9-12 individual membrane probes installed at various soil depths. Each probe was made of a stainless steel pipe with a 1 mm orifice covered with a silicone membrane. Soil gases diffuse through the membrane at a rate proportional to the ambient soil gas concentration. To measure diffusion rates, the probes are flushed with N-2 one-by-one at regular time intervals and accumulated gas is detected as a spike with IR and FID analyzers. The longer the period between flushings the higher the gas accumulation and the lower the detection limit for a particular soil gas. The developed MPA agreed well with conventional manual gas sampling in West-Siberian mesotrophic fen. In peat cores with intact Carex-Sphagnum vegetation incubated under constant temperature, water level and artificial light:dark (14: 10) cycles, regular diurnal oscillations of soil CO2 and CH4 occurred in the upper part of the peat core down to 19 cm. Gas content in the top layer (3 cm) grew during the light phase, and returned back during the dark phase. In layers further down in the soil, the same events were observed but with progressively increased time delay and lower amplitude. The obtained data agreed with the hypothesis that diurnal variations in soil CO2 and CH4 content are caused by periodic changes in intensity of root exudation that provide a major C- and energy source for soil microorganisms including methanogens. At a soil depth of 23 cm, where the peak of gas bubbles occurred, the signal for both gases became chaotic and not related to the light:dark cycle. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil thawing can affect the turnover of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) and their release into the atmosphere. However, little has been known about the release of C and N during the thawing of alpine soils in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This study investigated the effects of soil thawing on the release of CO2, CH4, and N2O from alpine peatland soils and alpine meadow soils through an indoor experiment and determined the changes in the dissolved organic C (DOC), dissolved organic N (DON), NO3--N, NH4+-N, and NO2--N concentrations in the soils after soil thawing. The freeze-thaw treatments were performed by incubating the soil columns at mild (-5 degrees C) and severe (-15 degrees C) for 14 days, and then at 5 degrees C for 18 days. The control columns were incubated at 5 degrees C. During thawing, the cumulative CO2 emissions from the severely frozen alpine peatland soils and alpine meadow soils were 36 and 85 % higher than those from the control soils, and the cumulative N2O emissions were 3.9 and 5.8 times higher than those from the control soils. However, the thawing after mild freezing produced no significant effects. The two freezing temperatures significantly increased the release of CH4 from the alpine peatland soils, but the thawing of the severely frozen soils reduced the CH4 uptake of the alpine meadow soils by 27 %. After the severely frozen alpine peatland soils thawed, the concentrations of DOC, DON, NO3--N, NH4+-N, and NO2--N increased significantly, but NO2--N showed no significant changes for the alpine meadow soils. After thawing with mild freezing, DOC in the alpine peatland soils and NH4+-N, NO2--N, and DOC in the alpine meadow soils showed no significant changes. This study indicates that the potential for release of C and N from alpine soils during thawing periods strongly depends on the freezing temperature and soil types.

AB The 2019 Inter-governmental Panel (IPCC) Report on Climate Change and Land highlighted the urgency and scale of the environmental impact from human-induced landscape change. Palm oil has historically had a particularly negative reputation for driving deforestation, biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions, social exploitation and damaging health. In the eyes of many in the West, it is regarded as the world's most hated crop. However, palm is highly productive compared with other crops and produces 40% of the worlds edible oil from only 5% of vegetable oil producing land and 0.4% of agricultural land in total. It has the potential to meet future demand for oil with minimum additional environmental and climate impact compared with other sources of vegetable oil. The related high value density has the potential to move millions of vulnerable smallholder farmers out of poverty. Given the conclusions of the IPCC Climate and Land Report, it is therefore important to re-examine the crop's reputation in light of the accumulated evidence and to properly understand the full impacts across the environmental, health, social and economic factors. We present a comprehensive review of the benefits and risks of the crop across these dimensions and provide a new synthesis. We conclude that while oil palm has had a significant negative impact on habitat and biodiversity, it plays a minor role compared with poaching, illegal logging and threats from climate change. There are important opportunities for the industry to reverse this damage. Its reputation for negative health impacts are not backed up by the scientific evidence and indeed there may be health benefits from substituting some oils in the diet with oil palm. Positive social and economic impacts are most obvious in areas where proper market-led economies are in place, but there can be significant negative social impacts in less developed areas. We conclude that much of the reputation of palm oil is not based on a balanced interpretation of the scientific evidence. Provided future development is zero deforestation, does not occur on peat, uses methane capture technology at the mills, empowers indigenous smallholders and supports the regeneration of secondary forest, we conclude that oil palm can be the most environmentally, socially and economically sustainable means to meet future demand for vegetable oil. Indeed, with pro-active collaboration with relevant non-government organisations, oil palm can be part of the solution to reversing the degradation of tropical forest biomes.

AB The ongoing reclamation of boreal forest areas that are impacted by oil sands mining involves the construction of wetlands as desirable land uses. Constructed wetlands receiving peat-mining runoff are known to be major sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere. However, the GHG fluxes of a fen that is constructed with drained peat substrate and receives runoff containing effluents of salt and naphthenic acids is not known. Using a fen constructed in the post-mining landscape of the Athabasca oil sands region, a study was conducted to quantify the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) during the peak growing seasons over the first two years following revegetation. The specific objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of revegetation strategies and other environmental characteristics on the fen GHG emissions over the growing season. Relative to a natural fen, our results show significantly lower fluxes of CH4 (p < 0.001), which correlate with higher bulk density, lower organic matter content, and higher pH and SO42- concentration in the constructed fen. Revegetation did not stimulate CH4 production, but increased CO2 uptake and reduced N2O emissions relative to the non-vegetated control. These results suggest that revegetation strategies and water chemistry might be more important controls on GHG fluxes than substrate quality in a constructed fen. Although the current edaphic conditions in the constructed fen support the potential for a net uptake of GHGs over the growing season, additional monitoring is required to evaluate if these conditions will persist in the long-term. We recommend that future reclamation projects should consider the potential effects of construction materials on water chemistry prior to use in fen reclamation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) interstadials are marked by a sharp increase in the atmospheric methane (CH4) concentration, as recorded in ice cores. Wetlands are assumed to be the major source of this CH4, although several other hypotheses have been advanced. Modelling of CH4 emissions is crucial to quantify CH4 sources for past climates.
   Vegetation effects are generally highly generalized in modelling past and present-day CH4 fluxes, but should not be neglected. Plants strongly affect the soil-atmosphere exchange of CH4 and the net primary production of the vegetation supplies organic matter as substrate for methanogens. For modelling past CH4 fluxes from northern wetlands, assumptions on vegetation are highly relevant since paleobotanical data indicate large differences in Last Glacial (LG) wetland vegetation composition as compared to modern wetland vegetation. Besides more cold-adapted vegetation, Sphagnum mosses appear to be much less dominant during large parts of the LG than at present, which particularly affects CH4 oxidation and transport. To evaluate the effect of vegetation parameters, we used the PEATLAND-VU wetland CO2/CH4 model to simulate emissions from wetlands in continental Europe during LG and modern climates. We tested the effect of parameters influencing oxidation during plant transport (f(ox)), vegetation net primary production (NPP, parameter symbol P-max), plant transport rate (V-transp), maximum rooting depth (Z(root)) and root exudation rate (f(ex)). Our model results show that modelled CH4 fluxes are sensitive to f(ox) and Z(root) in particular. The effects of P-max, V-transp and f(ex) are of lesser relevance. Interactions with water table modelling are significant for V-transp.
   We conducted experiments with different wetland vegetation types for Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) stadial and interstadial climates and the present-day climate, by coupling PEATLAND-VU to high resolution climate model simulations for Europe. Experiments assuming dominance of one vegetation type (Sphagnum vs. Carex vs. Shrubs) show that Carex-dominated vegetation can increase CH4 emissions by 50% to 78% over Sphagnum-dominated vegetation depending on the modelled climate, while for shrubs this increase ranges from 42% to 72%. Consequently, during the LG northern wetlands may have had CH4 emissions similar to their present-day counterparts, despite a colder climate. Changes in dominant wetland vegetation, therefore, may drive changes in wetland CH4 fluxes, in the past as well as in the future.

AB Upland peat soils represent a large terrestrial carbon store and as such have the potential to be either an ongoing net sink of carbon or a significant net source of carbon. In the UK many upland peats are managed for a range of purposes but these purposes have rarely included carbon stewardship. However, there is now an opportunity to consider whether management practices could be altered to enhance storage of carbon in upland peats. Further. there are now voluntary and regulated carbon trading schemes operational throughout Europe that mean stored carbon, if verified, could have an economic and tradeable value. This means that new income streams could become available for upland management. The 'Sustainable Uplands' RELU project has developed a model for calculating carbon fluxes from peat soils that covers all carbon uptake and release pathways (e.g. fluvial and gaseous pathways). The model has been developed so that the impact of common management options within UK upland peats can be considered. The model was run for a decade from 1997-2006 and applied to an area of 550 km(2) of upland peat soils in the Peak District. The study estimates that the region is presently a net sink of - 62 ktonnes CO2 equivalent at an average export of - 136 tonnes CO2 equivalent/km(2)/yr. If management interventions were targeted across the area the total sink could increase to - 160 ktonnes CO2/yr at an average export of - 219 tonnes CO2 equivalent/km(2)/yr. However, not all interventions resulted in a benefit; some resulted in increased losses Of CO2 equivalents. Given present costs of peatland restoration and value of carbon offsets, the study suggests that 51% of those areas, where a carbon benefit was estimated by modelling for targeted action of management interventions, would show a profit from carbon offsetting within 30 years.

AB Permafrost thaw in northern peatlands alters the ground thermal conditions, moisture, and chemistry that control microbial activity responsible for the production of greenhouse gases (GHGs) like methane from decomposing organic matter. This paper examines interactions between microbial communities, peat chemistry, moisture content, and temperature in the context of degrading palsa fields in the vast (372,000 km(2)), carbon rich, and rapidly warming permafrost peatlands of the Hudson Bay Lowlands. The temperature sensitivities of microbial GHG production and consumption from palsa and fen peat were assessed, and microbial community structure was examined as a potential constraint on GHG production in relation to changes in peat chemistry associated with thermokarst encroachment and active layer deepening. High CH4 production was observed from thermokarst peat, under controlled moisture and temperature conditions, associated with increased pH. A shift in methanogen taxonomic and metabolic diversity favoring aceticlastic methanogenesis was associated with changes in peat chemistry and pH from palsa to thermokarst fen peat. In palsa peat, CH4 production rates were lowest but most sensitive to temperature variations, due to recalcitrant carbon compounds. CH4 production was highly sensitive to increased temperatures, yet was balanced by high temperature sensitivity of CH4 oxidation in oxic conditions, consistent with the low temperature sensitivity of fluxes observed in field studies from other permafrost peatlands. Building on the microbial controls in this study, future work should explore how permafrost degradation and increased hydrological connectivity to mineral substrates are changing in this globally significant permafrost peatland, and how this impacts net CH4 emissions.

AB Wetlands store large amounts of carbon, and depending on their status and type, they release specific amounts of methane gas to the atmosphere. The connection between wetland type and methane emission has been investigated in various studies and utilized in climate change monitoring and modelling. For improved estimation of methane emissions, land surface models require information such as the wetland fraction and its dynamics over large areas. Existing datasets of wetland dynamics present the total amount of wetland (fraction) for each model grid cell, but do not discriminate the different wetland types like permanent lakes, periodically inundated areas or peatlands. Wet land types differently influence methane fluxes and thus their contribution to the total wetland fraction should be quantified. Especially wetlands of permafrost regions are expected to have a strong impact on future climate due to soil thawing. In this study ENIVSAT ASAR Wide Swath data was tested for operational monitoring of the distribution of areas with along-term S-W near 1(hS(W)) in northern Russia (S-W = degree of saturation with water, 1 = saturated), which is a specific characteristic of peatlands. For the whole northern Russia, areas with hS(W) were delineated and discriminated from dynamic and open water bodies for the years 2007 and 2008. The area identified with this method amounts to approximately 300,000 km(2) in northern Siberiain 2007. It overlaps with zones of high carbon storage. Comparison with a range of related datasets (static and dynamic) showed that hS(W) represents not only peatlands but also temporary wetlands associated with post-forest fire conditions in permafrost regions. Annual long-term monitoring of change in boreal and tundra environments is possible with the presented approach. Sentinel-1, the successor of ENVISAT ASAR, will provide data that may allow continuous monitoring of these wetland dynamics in the future complementing global observations of wetland fraction.

AB The magnitude of future emissions of greenhouse gases from the northern permafrost region depends crucially on the mineralization of soil organic carbon (SOC) that has accumulated over millennia in these perennially frozen soils. Many recent studies have used radiocarbon (C-14) to quantify the release of this "old" SOC as CO2 or CH4 to the atmosphere or as dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) to surface waters. We compiled similar to 1,900 C-14 measurements from 51 sites in the northern permafrost region to assess the vulnerability of thawing SOC in tundra, forest, peatland, lake, and river ecosystems. We found that growing season soil C-14-CO2 emissions generally had a modern (post-1950s) signature, but that well-drained, oxic soils had increased CO(2)emissions derived from older sources following recent thaw. The age of CO2 and CH4 emitted from lakes depended primarily on the age and quantity of SOC in sediments and on the mode of emission, and indicated substantial losses of previously frozen SOC from actively expanding thermokarst lakes. Increased fluvial export of aged DOC and POC occurred from sites where permafrost thaw caused soil thermal erosion. There was limited evidence supporting release of previously frozen SOC as CO2, CH4, and DOC from thawing peatlands with anoxic soils. This synthesis thus suggests widespread but not universal release of permafrost SOC following thaw. We show that different definitions of "old" sources among studies hamper the comparison of vulnerability of permafrost SOC across ecosystems and disturbances. We also highlight opportunities for future C-14 studies in the permafrost region.

AB The effect of tree (lodgepole pine) planting with and without intensive drainage on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes was assessed after 45 yr at a raised peatbog in West Flanders Moss, central Scotland. Fluxes of CO2 CH4 and N2O from the soil were monitored over a 2-yr period every 2 to 4 weeks using the static opaque chamber method in a randomised experimental block trial with the following treatments: drained and planted (DP), undrained and planted (uDP), undrained and unplanted (uDuP) and for reference also from an adjoining near-pristine area of bog at East Flanders Moss (n-pris). There was a strong seasonal pattern in both CO2 and CH4 effluxes which were significantly higher in late spring and summer months because of warmer temperatures. Effluxes of N2O were low and no significant differences were observed between the treatments. Annual CH4 emissions increased with the proximity of the water table to the soil surface across treatments in the order: DP < uDP < uDuP < n-pris with mean annual effluxes over the 2-yr monitoring period of 0.15, 0.64, 7.70 and 22.63 gCH(4) m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. For CO2, effluxes increased in the order uDP < DP < npris < uDuP, with mean annual effluxes of 1.23, 1.66, 1.82 and 2.55 kgCO(2) m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. CO2 effluxes dominated the total net GHG emission, calculated using the global warming potential (GWP) of the three GHGs for each treatment (76-98 %), and only in the n-pris site was CH4 a substantial contribution (23 %). Based on soil effluxes only, the near pristine (n-pris) peatbog had 43% higher total net GHG emission compared with the DP treatment because of high CH4 effluxes and the DP treatment had 33% higher total net emission compared with the uDP because drainage increased CO2 effluxes. Restoration is likely to increase CH4 emissions, but reduce CO2 effluxes. Our study suggests that if estimates of CO2 uptake by vegetation from similar peatbog sites were included, the total net GHG emission of restored peatbog would still be higher than that of the peatbog with trees.

AB Methane emissions from soils are the net result of two processes: methane (CH4) production and CH4 oxidation. In order to understand how both processes respond to environmental changes, it is necessary to distinguish between CH4 production and oxidation. In bacterial cultures and small soil samples, difluoromethane (CH2F2) was found to inhibit CH4 oxidation reversibly, without affecting CH4 production. Hence, CH2F2 allows the study of CH4 production directly and of CH4 oxidation indirectly. To our knowledge, however, the inhibitory effect of CH2F2 within soil columns has not yet been evaluated. We therefore tested which CH2F2 concentration is needed for complete inhibition of CH4 oxidation in reconstructed 28 cm high peat soil columns under different water levels (WL). We found that soil columns require considerably higher headspace CH2F2 concentrations for complete inhibition of CH4 oxidation than small soil samples. Inhibition remained complete until ca. 24 h after CH2F2 exposure. Then, the inhibitory effect diminished. The time needed for the inhibitory effect to disappear depended on WL: at a low WL of -15 cm, the inhibitory effect declined slowly and oxidation rates recovered by 90% only after 12 days. At WL = -5 cm, CH4 oxidation recovered much faster (90% recovery after ca. 3 days). Last, CH2F2 addition significantly decreased the N2O emissions, whereas CO2 emissions remained unaltered.

AB We explore 3 years of pore water profile data from a New Hampshire wetland to determine the rates of methane production and oxidation occurring in the water-saturated peat, and how these rates evolve over seasonal and annual timescales. For this study, pore water was collected and analyzed for the isotopic composition of the dissolved inorganic carbon and the concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane. These data are used, in conjunction with a 1-D model that simulates reaction and transport, to calculate the rates of methane production and oxidation necessary to recreate pore water profiles measured over seasonal and annual cycles from 2005 through 2007. We find column-integrated methane production rates to vary between 0 and 30 mu mol cm(-2) month(-1), averaging 6 mu mol cm(-2) month(-1) during the summer. The seasonal pattern in the depth-integrated methane production rates is observed to positively correlate with temperature change. Despite large differences in the water table depths over the years studied, we see no difference in mean methane production rates between years. Results from three different stations, each characterized by different local vegetation, do not find plant-mediated transport to be an important mechanism for methane removal from the saturated peat, although we did find evidence supporting possible oxygen leakage from roots. Significant differences were observed in subsurface respiration between the stations. We observed several instances of non-diffusive transport in both the subsurface methane and carbon dioxide pools, particularly during the early spring and late fall and hypothesize that rainfall events may contribute to significant degassing from the uppermost 40-60 cm of saturated peat. Supporting findings by an earlier study, these isotope-constrained methane production rates can only account for a fraction (between 0% and 21%) of the methane emissions from this site, indicating a source of methane at or above the pore water surface. Seasonal patterns indicate peak methanogenesis may be associated with the oxic-anoxic boundary. It remains uncertain as to whether the saturated peat should remain a focus for studies of wetland methane cycling, with this work indicating it plays only a small role in bulk methane fluxes from this site.

AB A long-term challenge in managing the climate effects of land use is the development of an efficient, comprehensive approach to the identification of greenhouse gas (GHG) balances. The approach would help in establishing robust methods for the cost-effective and climate-friendly targeting of land use options, for example, in peatlands, which are globally important sinks and sources of GHGs. The aims of this study were to create spatial models with the maximum entropy method Maxent so as to 1) identify the environmental variables that control the distribution of GHG sinks and sources in forestry-drained peatlands in Finland and 2) predict the landscape level distribution of GHG balances in two regional mire complex zones (the aapa mire and the raised bog zone). Several environmental datasets were used as sources of explanatory variables. Even though the significance of the explanatory variables were different between mire complex zones, the variables describing habitat conditions, such as drainage intensity and site fertility, contributed most to the models. Drainage intensity describes indirectly the moisture conditions and can thereby be used as a proxy for the water table. The results showed that relatively coarse-scale environmental data (25 ha grid cells) combined with spatial modelling have potential in explaining and predicting GHG balances at the landscape level: To our knowledge, this is the first time that spatial Maxent models have been used to model the distribution of GHG balances.

AB The temperate peatlands are extensive, covering around 3.5 million km(2) of land. They contain about 455 Gt of carbon, almost equivalent to the carbon stored in all of the living things on the surface of the planet, and representing around 25% of all the soil carbon on earth. These bogs are a sink for atmospheric carbon and their carbon uptake accounts for about 12% of current human emissions. They vary considerably in their form and structure and are an important resource for scientific research, including the study of past environments and climate change, and they are also valuable in environmental education. They are low in biodiversity, but their fauna and flora are distinctive and many groups are confined to this habitat. For all these reasons, the future conservation of peatlands is a matter for concern. Threats to peatlands come from direct human exploitation in the form of peat harvesting for energy and horticulture, and drainage for forestry. Rising environmental awareness should control both of these processes in the western world, but continued northern peatland losses are likely locally, especially in Asia. Peatland drainage for forestry or agriculture will result in losses of carbon to the atmosphere, adding to the greenhouse effect. Human population pressures, industrialization and urbanization are unlikely to have an important direct and immediate influence in the boreal zone. Fragmentation of the habitat is not an important consideration because bogs are by their very nature 'island' habitats. Acidification by aerial pollution may be a local problem close to sources, but the habitat is naturally acid and should not be severely affected, The input of aerial nutrients, however, particularly nitrogen, could have widespread impact on bogs, enhancing their productivity and altering their vegetation composition. The physical rehabilitation of bogs damaged by human activities presents many problems, particularly relating to the re-establishment of peat structure and vegetation, but the process can result in the re-formation of a carbon sink so it is worth the effort. Climate change is the most important consideration in its impact on bogs. Higher temperature (especially if accompanied by raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and increased nitrate deposition) will enhance productivity, but will also result in faster decomposition rates. The outcome of these opposing factors for peat formation will ultimately depend on the future pattern of precipitation. If, as seems most likely, summer conditions become warmer and drier in continental regions and winters become milder and wetter, the summer drought could cause peat loss and bog contraction. An excess of decomposition will lead to bogs becoming a carbon source and thus a positive feedback in global warming. Emissions of methane and nitrous oxide would add to the greenhouse gas problem, but likely oxidation of methane and low N(2)O production may well mean that this impact will not prove to be significant. Tree invasion of bogs as a consequence of summer drought could locally lead to increased water loss through transpiration, and higher heat absorption through albedo change. This will enhance the drying effect on the bog surface. Oceanic mires will be less severely affected if the expected increase in precipitation takes place in these regions. The most important overall factor in determining the future of the northern bogs is likely to be the quantity and pattern (both spatially and temporally) of future precipitation in the zone.

AB Peat soils can be strong sources of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O), but at the same time act as sinks for the greenhouse gas N2O. However, the role of N2O reduction to dinitrogen (N-2) here is still not fully understood. In particular, this applies to pristine or weakly disturbed fen mires. These types of peatland ecosystems are characterised by anoxic soil conditions and special N dynamics restricted to ammonium (NR4+) turnover and very low nitrate (NO3-) availability. N2O and N-2 fluxes from intact soil cores from three weakly disturbed fen mire types and two soil habitats (tussocks and hollows) were investigated using the helium (He) incubation approach. Ambient air in headspaces were first substituted with a He-O-2 trace gas mixture to quantify N2O and N-2 exchanges under prevailing soil oxygen (O-2) conditions, and then with an anoxic He trace gas mixture (99.9% He) for establishing the maximum possible denitrification rate. Changing from the He-O-2 mixture to a pure He trace gas mixture led to strong increase of N-2 fluxes (up to 2916 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) and negative N2O fluxes of up to -72 mu g N m(-2) h(-1). Whilst small differences in N gas fluxes were found between all types of fen mires, an analysis of the denitrifier abundance based on nirK, nirS and nosZ genes indicated respectively more pronounced variation. The structure of denitrifier communities exhibited a strong plot specificity driven by water-filled pore space, soil organic matter and soil pH. This short-term He incubation experiment revealed that weakly disturbed fen mires act as considerable N2O sinks under anoxic conditions and improved our knowledge of the original N dynamics in this peatland ecosystem.

AB Empirical greenhouse gas (GHG) flux estimates from diverse peatlands are required in order to derive emission factors for managed peatlands. This study on a drained fen peatland quantified the annual GHG balance (Carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and C exported in crop yield) from spring barley (SB) and reed canary grass (RCG) using static opaque chambers for GHG flux measurements and biomass yield for indirectly estimating gross primary production (GPP). Estimates of ecosystem respiration (ER) and GPP were compared with more advanced but costly and labor-intensive dynamic chamber studies. Annual GHG balance for the two cropping systems was 4.0 +/- 0.7 and 8.1 +/- 0.2 Mg CO2-C-eq ha(-1) from SB and RCG, respectively (mean +/- standard error, n= 3). Annual CH4 emissions were negligible (<0.006 Mg CO2-C-eq ha(-1)), and N2O emissions contributed only 4-13 % of the full GHG balance (0.5 and 0.3 Mg CO2-C-eq ha(-1) for SB and RCG, respectively). The statistical significance of low CH4 and N2O fluxes was evaluated by a simulation procedure which showed that most of CH4 fluxes were within the range that could arise from random variation associated with actual zero-flux situations. ER measured by static chamber and dynamic chamber methods was similar, particularly when using nonlinear regression techniques for flux calculations. A comparison of GPP derived from aboveground biomass and from measuring net ecosystem exchange (NEE) showed that GPP estimation from biomass might be useful, or serve as validation, for more advanced flux measurement methods. In conclusion, combining static opaque chambers for measuring ER of CO2 and CH4 and N2O fluxes with biomass yield for GPP estimation worked well in the drained fen peatland cropped to SB and RCG and presented a valid alternative to estimating the full GHG balance by dynamic chambers.

AB Wetlands in general and mires in particular belong to the most important terrestrial carbon stocks globally. Mires (i.e. bogs, transition bogs and fens) are assumed to be especially vulnerable to climate change because they depend on specific, namely cool and humid, climatic conditions. In this paper, we use distribution data of the nine mire types to be found in Austria and habitat distribution models for four IPCC scenarios to evaluate climate change induced risks for mire ecosystems within the 21st century. We found that climatic factors substantially contribute to explain the current distribution of all nine Austrian mire ecosystem types. Summer temperature proved to be the most important predictor for the majority of mire ecosystems. Precipitation-mostly spring and summer precipitation sums-was influential for some mire ecosystem types which depend partly or entirely on ground water supply (e.g. fens). We found severe climate change induced risks for all mire ecosystems, with rain-fed bog ecosystems being most threatened. Differences between scenarios are moderate for the mid-21st century, but become more pronounced towards the end of the 21st century, with near total loss of climate space projected for some ecosystem types (bogs, quagmires) under severe climate change. Our results imply that even under minimum expected, i.e. inevitable climate change, climatic risks for mires in Austria will be considerable. Nevertheless, the pronounced differences in projected habitat loss between moderate and severe climate change scenarios indicate that limiting future warming will likely contribute to enhance long-term survival of mire ecosystems, and to reduce future greenhouse gas emissions from decomposing peat. Effectively stopping and reversing the deterioration of mire ecosystems caused by conventional threats can be regarded as a contribution to climate change mitigation. Because hydrologically intact mires are more resilient to climatic changes, this would also maintain the nature conservation value of mires, and help to reduce the severe climatic risks to which most Austrian mire ecosystems may be exposed in the 2nd half of the 21st century according to IPCC scenarios.

AB Minerotrophic peatlands or fen mires are characterized by anaerobic conditions and subsequently by a delayed litter decomposition. Therefore, in spite of their relatively small global area proportion (approx. 3%), peatlands constitute important sinks for carbon and nitrogen compounds with approx. 30% of the world's terrestric reserves. Degraded by substantial drainage or cultivation peatlands with changing water tables convert from CIN sinks to C/N sources, because of strongly increased C and N mineralization processes. It was shown that such degraded peatlands release high rates of the radiatively active trace gas nitrous oxide. The groundwater table, mineral- N fertilization, and stage of degradation are major factors affecting the nitrous oxide release. To give reasons for measures reducing nitrous oxide emission from peatlands, further studies are needed focussing, on e.g., the influence of weather or vegetation or derivations to give evidence for large-scale areas, respectively.

AB The purpose of this paper is to introduce the gas exchange measurement and flux calculation methods commonly used in the projects of the programme "Greenhouse gas emissions from the use of peat and peatlands in Finland". The methods include measurements of instantaneous fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O made at the ecosystem-atmosphere boundary using closed chamber, and whole ecosystem fluxes of the gases using micrometeorological EC tower extending above the canopy, and the integration of seasonal and annual fluxes. In addition, tools developed for gap filling of missing weather records, and generating complete weather patterns for the key environmental controls of the gas fluxes are introduced. Derivation of emission factors from the collected gas fluxes, capable of reproducing the dynamic, climate dependent nature is outlined.

AB Soils associated with wet and ephemerally wet environments, i.e. wet soils, cover an area greater than 12.1 million km(2); inland wetlands deliver at least Int$27.0 trillion in tangible and intangible benefits. However, due to their intimate association with wet environments, wet soils are at risk of degradation during drought events. This review investigates the effects of drought on wet soils, with particular attention to the changes in soil geochemistry and greenhouse gas emissions. It is clear from this review that drought poses a significant threat to wet soils, a threat which can be difficult to determine before an event but which poses a catastrophic risk to some sites. Drought causes oxygen penetration to increase in wet soils, leading to an increase in oxidation of organic matter and reduced inorganic species (e.g. sulfides). Oxidation of these materials can lead to soil acidification, metal mobilization and to negative impacts on water quality. Increased oxygen in the soil profile also affects biogeochemical cycling, with increased production of nitrous oxide and decreased production of methane. Effects of drought differ between peat and mineral soil types and subtypes. Wet soils undergo major chronological transformations and biogeochemical changes in the alteration of environments occurring before, during and after drought conditions. Water conditions (i.e. subaqueous, saturated, unsaturated and resaturated) also play a major role in chronological soil transformations. Soils may not easily recover between severe droughts and instead enter alternative stable states. This review highlights substantial gaps in our understanding of the effects of drought on wet soils and shows that previous studies overrepresent relatively small geographical regions.

AB Methane flux was measured, employing the micrometeorological eddy correlation technique, during two growing seasons (1991 and 1992) in a peatland in Minnesota. As compared to 1991, the 1992 season was wetter and cooler Here we examine the seasonal distributions of CH4 flux and the relationship between concurrently measured CH4 and CO(2)fluxes. Midday CH4 flux was low (1.5 mg m(-2) h(-1)) during late May in both seasons. Subsequently, the flux ranged from 2.5 to 5.5 mg m(-2) h(-1) during early June to early July in both years. Methane flux peaked at 6.5 mg m(-2) h(-1) during mid July in 1991. The peak flux (8.0 mg m(-2) h(-1)) in 1992 occurred 3 weeks later. A sustained drop in water table during late July to late August in 1991 may have reduced the methane emission. During mid August-mid October in 1992, the water table was consistently high and the flux ranged from 2.0 to 3.0 mg m(-2) h(-1). As compared to 1991, CH4 flux during this time in 1992 was higher by about 1.0 mg m(-2) h(-1) because of the overriding influence of the water table. Integration over the growing season (late May to mid October), indicated that this ecosystem released approximately 10.4 and 11.5 g C m(-2) of CH4 in 1991 and 1992, respectively.
   We examined our concurrent measurements on methane flux and canopy photosynthesis under a variety of environmental conditions from different parts of the growing season. On a time scale of the entire season, the overall patterns of methane flux and canopy photosynthesis were similar in both years. Canopy photosynthesis, however, showed large day-to-day changes in response to variations in temperature and moisture. Corresponding changes in methane flux during these selected periods were relatively small. The slopes and correlation coefficients of linear regressions between methane flux and photosynthesis data varied widely. Accordingly, a close coupling between short-term (day to day) variations in methane flux and canopy photosynthesis was not evident.

AB Globally, large areas of peatland have been drained through the digging of ditches, generally to increase agricultural production. By lowering the water table it is often assumed that drainage reduces landscape-scale emissions of methane (CH4) into the atmosphere to negligible levels. However, drainage ditches themselves are known to be sources of CH4 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs), but emissions data are scarce, particularly for carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), and show high spatial and temporal variability. Here, we report dissolved GHGs and diffusive fluxes of CH4 and CO2 from ditches at three UK lowland fens under different management; semi-natural fen, cropland, and cropland restored to low-intensity grassland. Ditches at all three fens emitted GHGs to the atmosphere, but both fluxes and dissolved GHGs showed extensive variation both seasonally and within-site. CH4 fluxes were particularly large, with medians peaking at all three sites in August at 120-230 mg m(-2) d(-1). Significant between site differences were detected between the cropland and the other two sites for CO2 flux and all three dissolved GHGs, suggesting that intensive agriculture has major effects on ditch biogeochemistry. Multiple regression models using environmental and water chemistry data were able to explain 29-59% of observed variation in dissolved GHGs. Annual CH4 fluxes from the ditches were 37.8, 183 and 272 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) for the semi-natural, grassland and cropland, and annual CO2 fluxes were similar (1100 to 1440 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)) among sites. We suggest that fen ditches are important contributors to landscape scale GHG emissions, particularly for CH4. Ditch emissions should be included in GHG budgets of human modified fens, particularly where drainage has removed the original terrestrial CH4 source, e.g. agricultural peatlands.

AB Globally, peatlands are under threat from a range of land use related factors that have a significant impact on the provision of ecosystem services, such as biodiversity and carbon (C) sequestration/storage. In Ireland, approximately 84% of raised bogs (a priority habitat listed in Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive) have been affected by peat extraction. While restoration implies the return of ecosystem services that were characteristic of the pre-disturbed ecosystem, achieving this goal is often a challenge in degraded peatlands as post-drainage conditions vary considerably between sites. Here, we present multi-year greenhouse gas (GHG) and vegetation dynamics data from two former raised bogs in Ireland that were drained and either industrially extracted (milled) or cut on the margins for domestic use and subsequently rewetted (with no further management). When upscaled to the ecosystem level, the rewetted nutrient poor domestic cutover peatland was a net sink of carbon dioxide (CO2) (-49 +/- 66 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) and a source of methane (CH4) (19.7 +/- 5 g Cm-2 yr(-1)), while the nutrient rich industrial cutaway was a net source of CO2 (0.66 +/- 168 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) and CH4 (5.0 +/- 2.2 g Cm-2 yr(-1)). The rewetted domestic cutover site exhibited the expected range of micro-habitats and species composition found in natural (non-degraded) counterparts. In contrast, despite successful rewetting, the industrially extracted peatland did not exhibit typical raised bog flora. This study demonstrated that environmental and management variables can influence species composition and, therefore, the regeneration of species typical of natural sites, and has highlighted the climate benefits from rewetting degraded peatlands in terms of reduced GHG emissions. However, rewetting of degraded peatlands is a major challenge and in some cases reintroduction of bryophytes typical of natural raised bogs may be more difficult than the achievement of proper GHG emission savings.

AB An 18-month reciprocal peat transplant experiment was conducted between two peatlands in the Czech Republic. Both sites were 100% Sphagnum-covered, with no vascular plants, and no hummocks and hollows. Atmospheric depositions of sulfur were up to 10 times higher at the northern site Velke jerabi jezero (VJJ), compared to the southern site Cervene blato (CB). Forty-cm deep peat cores, 10-cm in diameter, were used as transplants and controls in five replicates. Our objective was to evaluate whether CO2 and CH4 emissions from Sphagnum peat bogs are governed mainly by organic matter quality in the substrate, or by environmental conditions. Emission rates and delta C-13 values of CO2 and CH4 were measured in the laboratory at time t=18 months. All measured parameters converged to those of the host site, indicating that, at least in the short-term perspective, environmental conditions were a more important control of greenhouse gas emissions than organic carbon quality in the substrate. Since sulfate reducers outcompete methanogens, we hypothesized that the S-polluted site VJJ should have lower methane emissions than CB. In fact, the opposite was true, with significantly (p < 0.01) higher methane emissions from VJJ. Additionally, as a first step in an effort to link C isotope composition of emitted gases and residual peat substrate, we determined whether multiple vertical delta C-13 profiles in peat agree. A high degree of within-site homogeneity in delta C-13 was found. When a specific vertical delta C-13 trend was seen in one peat core, the same trend was also seen in all the remaining peat cores from the wetland. The delta C-13 value increased downcore at both CB and VJJ. At VJJ, however, 20 cm below surface, a reversal to lower delta C-13 downcore was seen. Based on Pb-210 dating, peat at 20-cm depth at VJJ was only 15 years old. Increasing delta C-13 values in VJJ peat accumulated between 1880-1990 could not be caused by assimilation of atmospheric CO2 gradually enriched in the light isotope C-12 due to fossil fuel burning. Rather they were a result of a combination of isotope fractionations accompanying assimilation and mineralization of Sphagnum C. These isotope fractionations may record information about past changes in C storage in wetlands.

AB Western Boreal Plain peatlands can play an important role in the global nitrogen cycle by storing N in peat and potentially releasing large amounts of N to the atmosphere. In this study, biological denitrification rates were measured in marsh and fen vegetation zones in two boreal peatland-pond complexes in northcentral Alberta, Canada. Assuming negligible winter denitrification, we estimated annual denitrification rates of 11 g N.m(-2) in marshes and 24 g N.m(-2) in fens. Two techniques were employed to measure denitrification: 1) measurements of direct N-2-flux were taken from intact cores in gas-tight N-free chambers, and 2) nitrous oxide (N2O) flux was measured in the two fens using in situ chambers. N-2 fluxes ranged from 2.14-4.19 mg N.m(-2).h(-1) in marshes and 6.19-6.81 mg N.m(-2).h(-1) in fens. N2O release from fen peat ranged from consumption to 0.025 mg N.m(-2).h(-1). Peat with higher carbon and moisture content was a source of N2O Whereas peat with lower carbon and moisture content was a sink. Surface water did not appear to be a major source of nitrate for denitrification. However, denitrification rates were positively correlated with peat extractable nitrate. Combined with mineralization studies, this indicated that soil nitrification provided most of the substrate for denitrification.

AB This study uses life-cycle analysis to examine the net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the Canadian peat industry for the period 1990-2000. GHG exchange is estimated for land-use change, peat extraction and processing, transport to market, and the in situ decomposition of extracted peat. The estimates, based on an additive GHG accounting model, show that the peat extraction life cycle emitted 0.54 X 10(6) t of GHG in 1990, increasing to 0.89 X 10(6) t in 2000 (expressed as CO2 equivalents using a 100-y time horizon). Peat decomposition associated with end use was the largest source of GHGs, comprising 71% of total emissions during this 11-y period. Land use change resulted in a switch of the peatlands from a GHG sink to a source and contributed an additional 15%. Peat transportation was responsible for 10% of total GHG emissions, and extraction and processing contributed 4%. It would take approximately 2000 y to restore the carbon pool to its original size if peatland restoration is successful and the cutover peatland once again becomes a net carbon sink.

AB Peatlands represent a vast carbon reserve that has accumulated under conditions of low nitrogen availability. Given the strong coupling between the carbon and nitrogen cycles, we need to establish the consequences of the increase in reactive nitrogen deposition for the sustainability of peatlands, and whether the form in which the nitrogen is deposited makes a difference. We have addressed these questions using a globally unique field simulation of reactive N deposition as dry deposited ammonia and wet deposited reduced N, ammonium and oxidised N, nitrate, added as ammonium chloride or sodium nitrate, to an ombrotrophic peatland, Whim bog in SE Scotland. Here we report the fate of 56 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) additions over 10 yr and the consequences. The effects of 10 yr of reactive N additions depended on the form in which the N was applied. Ammonia-N deposition caused the keystone Sphagnum species, together with the main shrub Calluna and the pleurocarpous mosses, to disappear, exposing up to 30% of the peat surface. This led to a significant increase in soil water nitrate and nitrous oxide emissions. By contrast wet deposited N, despite significantly reducing the cover of Sphagnum and Pleurozium moss, did not have a detrimental effect on Calluna cover nor did it significantly change soil water N concentrations or nitrous oxide emissions. Importantly 10 yr of wet deposited N did not bare the peat surface nor significantly disrupt the vegetation enabling the N to be retained within the carbon rich peatland ecosystems. However, given the significant role of Sphagnum in maintaining conditions that retard decomposition, this study suggests that all nitrogen forms will eventually compromise carbon sequestration by peatlands through loss of some keystone Sphagnum species.

AB The impact of hydrological manipulation on the mineralisation rates, measured as carbon dioxide and methane production rates, in the soil of the land-water transition zone of an unfertilised, Dutch peat grassland area was studied. The hydrological manipulation involved raising the ditch and groundwater levels by admitting nutrient-poor, Ca-rich groundwater in the trial area. An adjacent, fertilised, field served as a control. On an annual basis the CO2 production rate was usually highest in the parcels, intermediate in the ditch banks and lowest in the ditch bottoms, ranging from 2496 to 598 kg C ha(-1) year(-1) in the wet field and from 2918 to 421 (kg C) ha(-1) year(-1) in the control field. The CH4 production rate was negligible in the parcels, low in the ditch banks and substantial in the ditch bottoms, ranging from 0 to 1175 (kg C) ha(-1) year(-1) in the wet field and from 2 to 241 (kg C) ha(-1) year(-1) in the control field. The CO2 production rate was significantly affected by pH, C:N ratio and by moisture content. It tended to be highest at pH 5.8, at a C:N ratio of 12, at a moisture content of 50% and at a temperature of 20 degrees C. The CH4 production rate was significantly affected by pH, organic matter content and C:N ratio. It tended to be highest at pH 6.7, at an organic matter content of >40% and at a C:N ratio of 17. A temperature effect was not apparent. It was estimated that the CO2 and CH4 production rates of typical Dutch peat grasslands are 2824.3 and 6.1 (kg C) ha(-1) year(-1) when used for agriculture, but 2435.5 and 20.8 (kg C) ha(-1) year(-1) when rewetted with nutrient-poor, Ca-rich artesian water. Thus, rewetting, e.g. for nature conservation purposes, may cause the production of CO2 to decrease by 14% but that of CH4 to increase 3.4-fold. Circumstances in which these gases are emitted were discussed. This study indicates that hydrological manipulation of typical Dutch peat-grassland areas ire which fertilisation has ceased has profound effects on the production of CO2 and CH4 of these systems and may lead to increased emission of methane to the atmosphere.

AB Field and lab-based methane (CH4) fluxes and methanogen community structure were characterized across three peatlands in central Ontario (Canada) representing a successional and nutrient gradient from rich to poor fens. Air temperature was a strong and significant predictor of both CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes among the three sites. Net CH4 efflux and in vitro CH4 production potential were significantly greater in the rich and intermediate than the poor fen site. Although the poor fen site had the lowest water table position, this was not a significant predictor of CH4 emissions and in general the 3 sites were relatively wet compared to many northern peatlands. Consistently, during spring and fall, ethanol stimulated in vitro CH4 production potential from the poor fen, but not the rich and intermediate sites, indicating substrate limitation for CH4 production in the poor fen. Lower rates of CH4 production and emissions in the poor fen site were consistent with our hypotheses based on poorer substrate quality and a lack of sedges in that peatland type. However phylogeny of dominant methanogens inferred from terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses of 16S rDNA illustrated inconsistencies with previous reports of methanogens in northern peatlands. For example members likely of the family Methanosaetaceae (obligate high-affinity acetate fermenters) comprised a substantial portion of total methanogen population in the poor fen. In contrast, members of the order Methanomicrobiales (obligate CO2 reducers) were important methanogens in the rich and intermediate fens and not detected in the poor fen. Methanogen community structure based on T-RFLP across the 3 sites was distinct during spring, while during fall methanogen communities in the poor fen samples were still somewhat distinct from those in the rich and intermediate fens. Methanogen diversity (community richness and evenness) was not correlated with rates of CH4 production in the spring when soil respiration, and presumably rhizosphere activity, was slow. However, diversity was a significant predictor of CH4 production in the early fall (when both production and emissions rates were higher), indicating that methanogen diversity can potentially play a role in biogeochemical cycling and greenhouse gas emissions in northern peatlands.

AB This article provides an overview of the effects of land-use on the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) and from peatlands in the Nordic countries based on the field data from about 100 studies. In addition, this review aims to identify the gaps in the present knowledge on the greenhouse gas (GHG) balances associated with the land-use of these northern ecosystems. Northern peatlands have accumulated, as peat, a vast amount of carbon from the atmosphere since the last glaciation. However, the past land-use and present climate have evidently changed their GHG balance. Unmanaged boreal peatlands may act as net sources or sinks for CO2 and CH4 depending on the weather conditions. Drainage for agriculture has turned peatlands to significant sources of GHGs (mainly N2O and CO2). Annual mean GHG balances including net CH4, N2O and CO2 emissions are 2260, 2280 and 3140 gCO(2) eq. m(-2) (calculated using 100 year time horizon) for areas drained for grass swards, cereals or those left fallow, respectively. Even after cessetion of the cultivation practices, N2O and CO2 emissions remain high. The mean net GHG emissions in abandoned and afforested agricultural peatlands have been 1580 and 500 gCO(2) eq. m(-2), respectively. Peat extraction sites are net sources of GHGs with an average emission rate of 770 gCO(2) eq. m(-2). Cultivation of a perennial grass (e. g., reed canary grass) on an abandoned peat extraction site has been shown to convert such a site into a net sink of GHGs (-330 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). In contrast, despite restoration, such sites are known to emit GHGs (mean source of 480 gCO(2) eq. m(-2), mostly from high CH4 emissions). Peatland forests, originally drained for forestry, may act as net sinks (mean -780 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). However, the studies where all three GHGs have been measured at an ecosystem level in the forested peatlands are lacking. The data for restored peatland forests (clear cut and rewetted) indicate that such sites are on average a net sink (190 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). The mean emissions from drained peatlands presented here do not include emissions from ditches which form a part of the drainage network and can contribute significantly to the total GHG budget. Peat soils submerged under water reservoirs have acted as sources of CO2, CH4 and N2O (mean annual emission 240 gCO(2) eq. m(-2)). However, we cannot yet predict accurately the overall greenhouse gas fluxes of organic soils based on the site characteristics and land-use practices alone because the data on many land-use options and our understanding of the biogeochemical cycling associated with the gas fluxes are limited.

AB Recent findings on large nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from permafrost peatlands have shown that tundra soils can support high N2O release, which is on the contrary to what was thought previously. However, field data on this topic have been very limited, and the spatial and temporal extent of the phenomenon has not been known. To address this question, we studied N2O dynamics in two types of subarctic permafrost peatlands, a peat plateau in Russia and three palsa mires in Finland, including also adjacent upland soils. The peatlands studied have surfaces that are uplifted by frost (palsas and peat plateaus) and partly unvegetated as a result of wind erosion and frost action. Unvegetated peat surfaces with high N2O emissions were found from all the studied peatlands. Very high N2O emissions were measured from peat circles at the Russian site (1.40 +/- 0.15 g N(2)Om(-2)yr(-1)). Elevated, sparsely vegetated peat mounds at the same site had significantly lower N2O release. The N2O emissions from bare palsa surfaces in Northern Finland were highly variable but reached high rates, similar to those measured from the peat circles. All the vegetated soils studied had negligible N2O release. At the bare peat surfaces, the large N2O emissions were supported by the absence of plant N uptake, the low C:N ratio of the peat, the relatively high gross N mineralization rate and favourable moisture content, together increasing availability of mineral N for N2O production. We hypothesize that frost heave is crucial for high N2O emissions, since it lifts the peat above the water table, increasing oxygen availability and making it vulnerable to the the physical processes that may remove the vegetation cover. In the future, permafrost thawing may change the distribution of wet and dry surfaces in permafrost peatlands, which will affect N2O emissions.

AB Besides water vapour, greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, O-3 and N2O contribute similar to 60%, 20%, 10% and 6% to global warming, respectively; minor contribution is made by chlorofluorocarbons and volatile organic compounds (VOC). We present CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes from natural and relatively unmanaged soil-plant ecosystems (the ecosystems minimally disturbed by direct human or human- induced activities). All natural ecosystems are net sinks for CO2, although tundra and wetlands (including peatlands) are large sources of CH4, whereas significant N2O emissions occur mainly from tropical and temperate forests. Most natural ecosystems decrease net global warming potential (GWP) from - 0.03 +/- 0.35 t CO2-eha(-1) y(-1) (tropical forests) to - 0.90 +/- 0.42 t CO2-e ha(-1) y(-1) (temperate forests) and - 1.18 +/- 0.44 t CO2-e ha(-1) y(-1) (boreal forests), mostly as CO2 sinks in phytobiomass, microbial biomass and soil C. But net GWP contributions from wetlands are very large, which is primarily due to CH4 emissions. Although the tropical forest system provides a large carbon sink, the negligible capacity of tropical forests to reduce GWP is entirely due to N2O emissions, possibly from rapid N mineralisation under favourable temperature and moisture conditions. It is estimated that the natural ecosystems reduce the net atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 3.55 +/- 0.44 GtCO(2)-ey(-1) or similar to 0.5 ppm(v) CO2-e y(-1), hence, the significant role of natural and relatively unmanaged ecosystems in slowing global warming and climate change. However, the impact of increasing N deposition on natural ecosystems is poorly understood, and further understanding is required regarding the use of drainage as a management tool, to reduce CH4 emissions from wetlands and to increase GHG sink from the restoration of degraded lands, including saline and sodic soils. Data on GHG fluxes from natural and relatively unmanaged ecosystems are further compounded by large spatial and temporal heterogeneity, limited sensitivity of current instruments, few and poor global distribution of monitoring sites and limited capacity of models that could integrate GHG fluxes across ecosystems, atmosphere and oceans and include feedbacks from biophysical variables governing these fluxes.

AB Of all terrestrial ecosystems, peatlands store carbon most effectively in long-term scales of millennia. However, many peatlands have been drained for peat extraction or agricultural use. This converts peatlands from sinks to sources of carbon, causing approx. 5% of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect and additional negative effects on other ecosystem services. Rewetting peatlands can mitigate climate change and may be combined with management in the form of paludiculture. Rewetted peatlands, however, do not equal their pristine ancestors and their ecological functioning is not understood. This holds true especially for groundwater-fed fens. Their functioning results from manifold interactions and can only be understood following an integrative approach of many relevant fields of science, which we merge in the interdisciplinary project WETSCAPES. Here, we address interactions among water transport and chemistry, primary production, peat formation, matter transformation and transport, microbial community, and greenhouse gas exchange using state of the art methods. We record data on six study sites spread across three common fen types (Alder forest, percolation fen, and coastal fen), each in drained and rewetted states. First results revealed that indicators reflecting more long-term effects like vegetation and soil chemistry showed a stronger differentiation between drained and rewetted states than variables with a more immediate reaction to environmental change, like greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Variations in microbial community composition explained differences in soil chemical data as well as vegetation composition and GHG exchange. We show the importance of developing an integrative understanding of managed fen peatlands and their ecosystem functioning.

AB Extensive drainage of UK lowland peat soils for agricultural production is considered a major contribution to the rate of degradation and the loss of peat resources. Microbial oxidation resulting from drainage accelerates decay rates of organic matter and the release of CO2 to the atmosphere and contributes to severe subsidence. We examined the effect of soil moisture, temperature and nutrient amendment on soil CO2 respiration rates from a low-lying peat grassland and a low-lying peatland under intensive arable farming in the UK. Soil samples were obtained from three different depths and equilibrated at a range of moisture contents under four prescribed soil water potentials (-0.1 to -10 m). The samples were incubated in the laboratory and the influence of temperature (10, 22 and 30 degrees C) and N addition (C/N ratio of 10:1, 5:1 and 2.5:1) on peat respiration was measured. In addition, field soil samples were analysed to determine the microbial community structure using the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis technique. Respiration ranged from 0.8 to 15.0 mu g CO2-C g(-1) h(-1) at 10 degrees C and from 4.0 to 9.9 mu g CO2-C g(-1) h(-1) at 30 degrees C for different peats. Q(10) value between 22 and 30 degrees C ranged from 0.9 to 8.2. In contrast, Q(10) value between 10 and 22 degrees C varied from 0.2 to 2.2 suggesting, in some cases, an increase in respiration rate with decreasing temperature. Generally, temperature had a greater effect on the soils respiratory activity than the moisture content in drier pears, however soil moisture was determined to be the dominant parameter at higher moisture content. At high moisture content, the respiration rates at 10 degrees C exceeded those at 22 and 30 degrees C in four of the soils. Respiration varied with the degree of peat degradation and soil moisture content. Variations in soil moisture content did not always have a significant effect on CO2 emission in the humified surface pears but at higher soil moisture the CO2-C mineralisation rate of deeper, more fibrous peat horizons was higher at 10 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. Metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) ranged from 3.6 to 10.2 mg CO2-C h(-1) g biomass-C-1 in surface horizons and from 5.6 to 12.3 mg CO2-C h(-1) g biomass-C-1 in more fibrous pears, suggesting less available organic carbon at depth. N additions increased CO2-C mineralisation, with the maximum rate of respiration occurring at pressure potentials between -0.5 and -1 m. Peat samples at field moisture content were also analysed to determine phenotypic microbial community structure using PLFA analysis. This indicated that, microbial community structure varied between drained surface and saturated subsurface horizons. However, there was no difference in the microbial community structure between horizons when subjected to greater drainage. The effects of temperature and moisture on respiration found in deeper horizons and the phenotypic microbial community structure suggest that psychrophilic microbes predominate and that minimal drainage optimises their oxidation of peat.

AB The growing demand for bioenergy increases pressure on peatlands. The novel strategy of wet peatlands agriculture (paludiculture) may permit the production of bioenergy from biomass while avoiding large greenhouse gas emissions as occur during conventional crop cultivation on drained peat soils. Herein, we present the first greenhouse gas balances of a simulated paludiculture to assess its suitability as a biomass source from a climatic perspective. In a rewetted peatland, we performed closed-chamber measurements of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide exchange in stands of the potential crops Phragmites australis, Typha latifolia, and Carex acutiformis for two consecutive years. To simulate harvest, the biomass of half of the measurement spots was removed once per year. Carbon dioxide exchange was close to neutral in all tested stands. The effect of biomass harvest on the carbon dioxide exchange differed between the 2years. During the first and second year, methane emissions were 13-63gm(-2)a(-1) and 2-5gm(-2)a(-1), respectively. Nitrous oxide emissions lay below our detection limit. Net greenhouse gas balances in the study plots were close to being climate neutral during both years except for the Carex stand, which was a source of greenhouse gases in the first year (in CO2-equivalents: 18 tha(-1)a(-1)). Fifteen years after rewetting the net greenhouse gas balance of the study site was similar to those of pristine fens. In addition, we did not find a significant short-term effect of biomass harvest on net greenhouse gas balances. In our ecosystem, 17 tha(-1)a(-1) of CO2-equivalent emissions are saved by rewetting compared to a drained state. Applying this figure to the fen area in northern Germany, emission savings of 2.8-8.5 Mta(-1) CO2-equivalents could possibly be achieved by rewetting; this excludes additional savings by fossil fuel replacement.

AB Membrane inlet mass spectrometry was used to monitor dissolved gas concentrations (CO2, CH4 and O-2) in a mesotrophic peat core from Kopparas, Sweden.
   1 A comparison of depth profiles (down to 22 cm) with an ombrotrophic peat core (Ellergower, SW Scotland) investigated previously, revealed major differences in gas concentrations. Thus methane reached concentrations more than twice as high (800 muM) at depths greater than 12 cm in the Kopparas core. As shown previously, the primary determinant of the depth of the oxic zone is the level of the water table. Whereas in the Scottish cores, mass spectrometric detectability of O-2 was confined to the first 3 cm below this level, in the Swedish core penetration of O-2 was greater (7 cm). CO2 profiles were similar in cores from both locations.
   2 A thick layer of Sphagnum mosses dominated the plant cover of the Swedish peat core. A poorly developed deep root system, as distinct from that of the vascular plant cover in Scottish cores, diminished gas exchange rates, and presumably aerobic methane oxidation at depth around roots. These characteristics may contribute to the development of discontinuities in gas profiles at depths greater 15 cm as upward gas transport is established predominantly by diffusion and/or ebullition in the Swedish core.
   3 Monitoring gas concentrations at the peat surface and at 2 cm depth after changing water tables showed a delayed response of approximately 4 days as a result of the high water content and moisture-regulating capacity of mosses.
   4 Recovery processes at 2 cm depth after raising the water table revealed final production rates of dissolved CO2 and CH4 in the peat pore water between 0.8 and 4.4 mu mol h(-1) L-1 and between 0.1 and 1.7 mu mol h(-1) L-1, respectively. Higher production rates were found during the day, indicating a diurnal rhythm due to plant photosynthetic activity even at the low values of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR: 110 mu mol s(-1) m(-2)) used in the experimental set-up.
   5 In the water-logged mesotrophic Kopparas core changes of dissolved gas concentrations (DGC) at 3 and 14 cm depth were surface temperature-dependent rather than light dependent. This suggests that changes of air temperature alters the covering vegetation to increase the conductivity for dissolved gases through vascular plants and to facilitate gas transport by diffusion and/or ebullition.

AB Peat extraction leaves a land surface with a strong relief of deep cutover areas and higher ridges. Rewetting inundates the deep parts, while less deeply extracted zones remain at or above the water level. In temperate fens the flooded areas are colonized by helophytes such as Eriophorum angustifolium, Carex spp., Typha latifolia or Phragmites australis dependent on water depth. Reeds of Typha and Phragmites are reported as large sources of methane, but data on net CO2 uptake are contradictory for Typha and rare for Phragmites. Here, we analyze the effect of vegetation, water level and nutrient conditions on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for representative vegetation types along water level gradients at two rewetted cutover fens (mesotrophic and eutrophic) in Belarus. Greenhouse gas emissions were measured campaign-wise with manual chambers every 2 to 4 weeks for 2 years and interpolated by modelling.
   All sites had negligible nitrous oxide exchange rates. Most sites were carbon sinks and small GHG sources. Methane emissions generally increased with net ecosystem CO2 uptake. Mesotrophic small sedge reeds with water table around the land surface were small GHG sources in the range of 2.3 to 4.2 tCO(2) eq.ha(-1) yr(-1). Eutrophic tall sedge -Typha latifolia reeds on newly formed floating mats were substantial net GHG emitters in the range of 25.1 to 39.1 tCO(2) eq.ha(-1) yr. They represent transient vegetation stages. Phragmites reeds ranged between -1.7 to 4.2 tCO(2) eq.ha(-1) yr(-1) with an overall mean GHG emission of 1.3 tCO(2) eq.ha(-1) yr(-1). The annual CO2 balance was best explained by vegetation biomass, which includes the role of vegetation composition and species. Methane emissions were obviously driven by biological activity of vegetation and soil organisms.
   Shallow flooding of cutover temperate fens is a suitable measure to arrive at low GHG emissions. Phragmites australis establishment should be promoted in deeper flooded areas and will lead to moderate, but variable GHG emissions or even occasional sinks. The risk of large GHG emissions is higher for eutrophic than mesotrophic peatlands. Nevertheless, flooding of eutrophic temperate fens still represents a safe GHG mitigation option because even the hotspot of our study, the floating tall sedge - Typha latifolia reeds, did not exceed the typical range of GHG emissions from drained fen grasslands and the spatially dominant Phragmites australis reed emitted by far less GHG than drained fens.

AB Sphagnum farming - the production of Sphagnum biomass on rewetted bogs - helps towards achieving global climate goals by halting greenhouse gas emissions from drained peat and by replacing peat with a renewable biomass alternative. Large-scale implementation of Sphagnum farming requires a wide range of know-how, from initial species selection up to the final production and use of Sphagnum biomass based growing media in horticulture. This article provides an overview of relevant knowledge accumulated over the last 15 years and identifies open questions.

TI Calibrating the sqHIMMELI v1.0 wetland methane emission model with

AB Estimating methane (CH4) emissions from natural wetlands is complex, and the estimates contain large uncertainties. The models used for the task are typically heavily parameterized and the parameter values are not well known. In this study, we perform a Bayesian model calibration for a new wetland CH4 emission model to improve the quality of the predictions and to understand the limitations of such models.
   The detailed process model that we analyze contains descriptions for CH4 production from anaerobic respiration, CH4 oxidation, and gas transportation by diffusion, ebullition, and the aerenchyma cells of vascular plants. The processes are controlled by several tunable parameters. We use a hierarchical statistical model to describe the parameters and obtain the posterior distributions of the parameters and uncertainties in the processes with adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), importance resampling, and time series analysis techniques. For the estimation, the analysis utilizes measurement data from the Siikaneva flux measurement site in southern Finland.
   The uncertainties related to the parameters and the modeled processes are described quantitatively. At the process level, the flux measurement data are able to constrain the CH4 production processes, methane oxidation, and the different gas transport processes. The posterior covariance structures explain how the parameters and the processes are related. Additionally, the flux and flux component uncertain-ties are analyzed both at the annual and daily levels. The parameter posterior densities obtained provide information regarding importance of the different processes, which is also useful for development of wetland methane emission models other than the square root HelsinkI Model of MEthane buiLd- up and emIssion for peatlands (sqHIMMELI).
   The hierarchical modeling allows us to assess the effects of some of the parameters on an annual basis. The results of the calibration and the cross validation suggest that the early spring net primary production could be used to predict parameters affecting the annual methane production. Even though the calibration is specific to the Siikaneva site, the hierarchical modeling approach is well suited for larger-scale studies and the results of the estimation pave way for a regional or global- scale Bayesian calibration of wetland emission models.

AB To study the impact of forestry drainage on peat carbon storage, we cored paired quantitative peat samples from undrained and drained sides of an eccentric bog. Five pairs of 0 to <= 100-cm-deep surface-peat cores, and a pair of profiles representing the full peat deposit provided stratigraphic evidence of marked loss of surface peat due to drainage. For the drained side cores, we found a relative subsidence of 25-37 cm of the surface, and a loss of about 10 kg(DW) m(-2), corresponding to 131 +/- 28 g C m(-2) a(-1) (mean +/- SE) for the post-drainage period Similar peat loss was also found in the full deposit profiles, thus lending credibility to the whole-column inventory approach, even though the decrease (9 kg(DW) m(-2)) was relatively small in comparison with the total carbon storage (233 and 224 kg(DW) m(-2) for the undrained and drained sides, respectively).

AB Large amounts of sulfate and divalent iron (Fe) are released into the pore water of acid sulfate (AS) soils upon oxidation of sulfidic materials. The simultaneously produced acidity dissolves metals from the soil matrix. Reduced horizons of AS soils commonly have a large mineral nitrogen (N) stock in the form of NH4+-N, which is a potential source of N leaching and gaseous emissions. This study was carried out at three AS soil sites in Finland. Cation composition of pore water was monitored in a monolithic lysimeter experiment. Timothy samples grown in an AS soil were analysed for mineral elements and the soil was investigated for zinc (Zn) distribution in different chemical species at four depths down to 85 cm. The composition of pipestems formed in previous root channels was investigated by SEM, X-ray EDX and XRD. Emissions of CO2 and N2O were measured in an AS field which had a peaty topsoil. Monitoring by closed chambers was carried out at three sites differing in the depth of peat layer (15, 30 and 60 cm). In the sulfuric horizon, large amounts of calcium and magnesium were mobilized. Reflooding stopped the mobilization of those elements but resulted in abundant dissolution of Fe, which became the dominant cation in the pore water. Timothy growing in an AS soil showed only small deviations from the average composition measured in Finland with the exception of Zn that was at the deficiency level. As Zn in the root zone had been dissolved and subsequently leached, it was recovered in easily soluble forms in the subsoil. Pipestem composition indicated accumulation of Fe and formation of a new solid phase probably mostly in the form of schwertmannite even though jarosite was also detected. The annual CO2 emissions from the peaty AS soil were about 6000 kg C ha(-1) but the (NO)-O-2 emissions were relatively small, with a magnitude more typical of mineral rather than organic soils. Thus, large N stock of an AS soil do not necessarily contribute to abundant gaseous N emissions.

AB Economic development creates challenges for land-use planners in balancing between increasing the use of natural resources and safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem services. We developed and utilized multi-objective numeric optimization models to analyze the trade-offs between biodiversity and ecosystem services (BES). The approach was used in the land-use planning process in northern Finland when selecting potential peat production sites as a part of the development of the regional master plan. We first quantified Net Present Value (NPV) of peat production, biodiversity, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and water emissions of peatlands. Then we applied multi-objective optimization to examine the trade-offs between the variables as well as to determine a cost-efficient selection of potential peat production sites, that is, a selection which would simultaneously generate the greatest possible economic returns and environmental benefits. Our results showed that with a relatively small decrease in NPV, a substantial decrease in biodiversity loss and a reduction in water emissions compared to the benchmark level could be attained. However, a significant decrease in GHG emissions resulted in a substantial decrease in NPV. We conclude that it is possible to significantly improve land-use management by applying multi-objective optimization in land-use planning.

AB Peatlands cover only about 3% the global land area, but store about twice as much carbon as global forest biomass. If intact peatlands are drained for agriculture or other human uses, peat oxidation can result in considerable CO(2)emissions and other greenhouse gases (GHG) for decades or even centuries. Despite their importance, emissions from degraded peatlands have so far not been included explicitly in mitigation pathways compatible with the Paris Agreement. Such pathways include land-demanding mitigation options like bioenergy or afforestation with substantial consequences for the land system. Therefore, besides GHG emissions owing to the historic conversion of intact peatlands, the increased demand for land in current mitigation pathways could result in drainage of presently intact peatlands, e.g. for bioenergy production. Here, we present the first quantitative model-based projections of future peatland dynamics and associated GHG emissions in the context of a 2 degrees C mitigation pathway. Our spatially explicit land-use modelling approach with global coverage simultaneously accounts for future food demand, based on population and income projections, and land-based mitigation measures. Without dedicated peatland policy and even in the case of peatland protection, our results indicate that the land system would remain a net source of CO(2)throughout the 21st century. This result is in contrast to the outcome of current mitigation pathways, in which the land system turns into a net carbon sink by 2100. However, our results indicate that it is possible to reconcile land use and GHG emissions in mitigation pathways through a peatland protectionandrestoration policy. According to our results, the land system would turn into a global net carbon sink by 2100, as projected by current mitigation pathways, if about 60% of present-day degraded peatlands would be rewetted in the coming decades, next to the protection of intact peatlands.

AB Both carbon dioxide and methane, major contributors to the greenhouse effect, are produced by soils as the end-products of decay of organic matter, In response to global temperature changes, decomposition processes may increase, creating the potential for a positive feedback mechanism. CO2 and CH4 emissions from two peat sites in Scotland were monitored and related to temperature and moisture. Bad a Cheo is a deep Sphagnum bog in 'The Flow Country', Caithness with a small area planted with Sitka spruce and Lodgepole pine. Glensaugh is a hill blanket pear at the edge of the Grampian Mountains, the primary vegetation being heather with a mixture of grasses. A wetter area also contained Sphagnum.
   CO2 emission rates at both sites showed a marked seasonal pattern and parallelled the ambient soil temperature, Values ranged from 10 mg C m(-2) h(-1) in the indigenous bog area at Bad a Cheo in March to 190 mg C m(-2) h(-1) in the adjoining forest area in July. At Glensaugh values in the dry area tended to be about 40% greater than those in the wet area while at Bad a Cheo those in the forest plantation were on average 90% greater than those in the indigenous bog area. The effect of temperature was modelled using the Arrhenius equation. The resulting activation energy varied between 81 kJ mol(-1) for the Bad a Cheo bog area to 124 kJ mol(-1) for the Glensaugh wet area. Q(10) values were estimated as 3.3 and 6.1, respectively. These seemed to be greater than many published values for mineral soils. Significant CH4 emissions were only found for the Bad a Cheo bog area and ranged from being undetectable in January to 1.05 mg C m(-2) h(-1) in September. Linear regression using the Arrhenius model showed that only 23% of the variation in CH4 flux could be explained by temperature with a Q(10) of 2.8.
   Using the responses to temperature as determined above it was possible to estimate the increase in carbon dioxide emission from these sites for any given rise in annual mean temperature (Delta T), For Delta T = 2.5 degrees C the increase in CO2 emission was 36% and 59% for the Bad a Cheo bog and Glensaugh wet areas, respectively. For Delta T = 4.5 degrees C, a doubling of CO2 emissions was predicted which, when extended over the global range of pear and organic soils, could have a significant effect on the contribution of soil carbon to atmospheric CO2. Repeating the above calculations for methane gave an increase 60% for Delta T = 4.5 degrees C. However, the main effect on methane would be due future changes to the moisture content. Land use changes such as drainage and afforestation can also have a major effect in reducing methane emissions.

AB [1] Northern peatlands contain enormous quantities of organic carbon within a few meters of the atmosphere and play a significant role in the planetary carbon balance. We have developed a new, process-oriented model of the contemporary carbon balance of northern peatlands, the Peatland Carbon Simulator (PCARS). Components of PCARS are (1) vascular and nonvascular plant photosynthesis and respiration, net aboveground and belowground production, and litterfall; (2) aerobic and anaerobic decomposition of peat; (3) production, oxidation, and emission of methane; and (4) dissolved organic carbon loss with drainage water. PCARS has an hourly time step and requires air and soil temperatures, incoming radiation, water table depth, and horizontal drainage as drivers. Simulations predict a complete peatland C balance for one season to several years. A 3-year simulation was conducted for Mer Bleue Bog, near Ottawa, Ontario, and results were compared with multiyear eddy covariance tower CO(2) flux and ancillary measurements from the site. Seasonal patterns and the general magnitude of net ecosystem exchange of CO(2) were similar for PCARS and the tower data, though PCARS was generally biased toward net ecosystem respiration (i.e., carbon loss). Gross photosynthesis rates (calculated directly in PCARS, empirically inferred from tower data) were in good accord, so the discrepancy between model and measurement was likely related to autotrophic and/or heterotrophic respiration. Modeled and measured methane emission rates were quite low. PCARS has been designed to link with the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) land surface model and a global climate model (GCM) to examine climate-peatland carbon feedbacks at regional scales in future analyses.

TI Greenhouse impact due to different peat fuel utilisation chains in
   Finland - a life-cycle approach
SO BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID EMISSIONS; CO2
AB Greenhouse impacts of different peat fuel utilisation chains were studied. A life cycle approach was used in order to cover all important emissions and sinks due to activities linked to the peat fuel production and utilisation. Radiative forcing was used to describe the greenhouse impact, and the results are given per one petajoule of energy produced. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and sinks were considered. Investigated peat production reserves were pristine peatland (fen), forestry-drained peatland, and cultivated (cropland) peatland. The considered phases of the peat utilisation chain included peat fuel production, storage, transport, combustion and the after-treatment of the cut-away peatland. After-treatment alternatives were afforestation and restoration. The greenhouse impact of a considered peat fuel chain was calculated by subtracting the emissions/sinks of a production reserve in a state of non-utilisation from the emissions/sinks of peat utilisation chain. According to the results, the most climate-friendly peat production chain is cultivated peatland-afforestation. Cultivated peatland has large greenhouse gas emissions and these emissions from the land area are ceased by the removal of the peat layer, when the area is utilised for peat fuel production. If forestry-drained peatland or pristine fen is used for peat fuel production, the greenhouse impacts of these chains are of the order of the greenhouse impact of the utilisation chain for coal. Improvement of peat production and combustion methods can be applied to decrease to some extent the greenhouse effect of peat energy.

ID CARBON; EXCHANGES; WETLAND; SCALE; CO2
AB Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) was studied in a bog located in the middle taiga of Siberia using two approaches, the accumulation of peat above the hypocotyl of pine trees, and the eddy covariance flux methodology. NEP was 0.84 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) using the peat accumulation method; it was 0.43-0.62 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) using eddy covariance over three growing seasons. These data were compared with NEP of the surrounding forest, which was 0.6 tC +/- 1.1 hat yr(-1). The trees growing on the bog reached a total height of about 3 m and an age of 80-120 yr when peat accumulation reached 0.5-0.6 m. At that stage the growth rate of the oldest trees declined. This indicates that there is a maximum age that can be reached by trees growing on hummocks (<150 yr), depending on conditions. The data show that the determination of NEP in bogs by using the peat accumulation above the hypocotyl is a useful method which can be applied on a wide range of bog types, but it may systematically overestimate NEP. The total sink capacity for carbon assimilation of bogs is comparable to that of forest, although methane emissions and losses of dissolved organic carbon must be taken into account when assessing the regional carbon cycle.

AB Efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are receiving increased attention among governmental and commercial actors. In recent years, the interest in paludiculture, i.e. the use of rewetted peatlands, has grown because of its potential to reduce GHG emissions by stopping soil decomposition. Moreover, cultivating wetland plants on rewetted peatlands for bioenergy production that replaces fossil fuels in the transport sector, can contribute to additional GHG emission reductions. In this study, an analysis of literature data was conducted to obtain data on GHG emissions (CO2 and CH4) and biomass production from rewetted peatlands cultivated with two different wetland plant species: Phragmites australis (Pa) and Typha latifolia (Tl). In addition, a biogas experiment was carried out to investigate the biomethane yield of Pa and Tl biomass, and the reduction of global warming potential (GWP) by using biomethane as vehicle fuel. The results show that peatland rewetting can be an important measure to mitigate the GWP as it reduces GHG emissions from the soil, particularly on a 100-year timescale but also to some extent on a 20-year timescale. More specifically, rewetting of 1 km(2) of peatland can result in a GWP reduction corresponding to the emissions from +/- 2600 average sized petrol cars annually. Growing Pa on rewetted peatlands reduces soil GHG emissions more than growing Tl, but Pa and Tl produced similar amounts of biomass and biomethane per land area. Our study concludes that Pa, because of a more pronounced GWP reduction, is the most suitable wetland plant to cultivate after peatland rewetting.

AB It is generally known that managed, drained peatlands act as carbon (C) sources. In this study we examined how mitigation through the reduction of the intensity of land management and through rewetting may affect the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and the C balance of intensively managed, drained, agricultural peatlands. Carbon and GHG balances were determined for three peatlands in the western part of the Netherlands from 2005 to 2008 by considering spatial and temporal variability of emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O). One area (Oukoop) is an intensively managed grass-on-peatland area, including a dairy farm, with the ground water level at an average annual depth of 0.55 (+/- 0.37) m below the soil surface. The second area (Stein) is an extensively managed grass-on-peatland area, formerly intensively managed, with a dynamic ground water level at an average annual depth of 0.45 (+/- 0.35) m below the soil surface. The third area is a (since 1998) rewetted former agricultural peatland (Horstermeer), close to Oukoop and Stein, with the average annual ground water level at a depth of 0.2 (+/- 0.20) m below the soil surface. During the measurement campaigns we found that both agriculturally managed sites acted as C and GHG sources and the rewetted former agricultural peatland acted as a C and GHG sink. The ecosystem (fields and ditches) total GHG balance, including CO2, CH4 and N2O, amounted to 3.9 (+/- 0.4), 1.3 (+/- 0.5) and -1.7 (+/- 1.8) g CO2-eq m(-2) d(-1) for Oukoop, Stein and Horstermeer, respectively. Adding the farm-based emissions to Oukoop and Stein resulted in a total GHG emission of 8.3 (+/- 1.0) and 6.6 (+/- 1.3) gCO(2)-eq m(-2) d(-1), respectively. For Horstermeer the GHG balance remained the same since no farm-based emissions exist. Considering the C balance (uncertainty range 40-60 %), the total C release in Oukoop and Stein is 5270 and 6258 kg Cha(-1) yr(-1), respectively (including ecosystem and management fluxes), and the total C uptake in Horstermeer is 3538 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Water bodies contributed significantly to the terrestrial GHG balance because of a high release of CH4.
   Overall, this study suggests that managed peatlands are large sources of GHGs and C, but, if appropriate measures are taken, they can be turned back into GHG and C sinks within 15 years of abandonment and rewetting. The shift from an intensively managed grass-on-peat area (Oukoop) to an extensively managed one (Stein) reduced the GHG emissions mainly because N2O emission and farm-based CH4 emissions decreased.

AB It is widely known that peatlands are a significant carbon (C) stock. Most peatlands are located in boreal and subarctic regions of the northern hemisphere but some occur also at high altitude and, contrary to the first; their contribution in terms of carbon sequestration is far less studied. In the Alps, there are numerous small peatlands, which are threatened by increasing temperatures and an alteration of their water balance. The aim of this study was to investigate the carbon fluxes of a small-scale fen in the Alps over three years (2012-2014).
   During the study period, the peatland experienced a high interannual variation in weather conditions while it acted as a carbon source based on CO2 emissions (NEE: 180.7 +/- 65.2 g C-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)) for all three years. This was mainly due to the short net C uptake period (73 7 days) and high respiration. Ecosystem respiration and summer gross primary production were both very high compared to other peatlands around the world and compared to a nearby low productive grassland. In wintertime, the soil did not freeze, resulting in a slow decomposition of the organic matter. Low methane fluxes were recorded during a 10-month measurement campaign, for a total of 3.2 g C-CH4 m(-2) over the December 2013-September 2014 period. Our findings suggest that the interannual variability of temperature and soil water content exert a strong influence on the carbon balance of peatlands of the Alps and that could further worsen depending upon the magnitude of climate change.

AB The aim of this study is to estimate emissions of greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O, and the effects of drainage and peat extraction on these processes, in Estonian transitional fens and ombrotrophic bogs. Closed-chamber-based sampling lasted from January to December 2009 in nine peatlands in Estonia, covering areas with different land-use practices: natural (four study sites), drained (six sites), abandoned peat mining (five sites) and active peat mining areas (five sites). Median values of soil CO2 efflux were 1,509, 1,921, 2,845 and 1,741 kg CO2-C ha(-1) year(-1) from natural, drained, abandoned and active mining areas, respectively. Emission of CH4-C (median values) was 85.2, 23.7, 0.07 and 0.12 kg ha(-1) year(-1), and N2O-N -0.05, -0.01, 0.18 and 0.19 kg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. There were significantly higher emissions of CO2 and N2O from abandoned and active peat mining areas, whereas CH4 emissions were significantly higher in natural and drained areas. Significant Spearman rank correlation was found between soil temperature and CO2 flux at all sites, and CH4 flux with high water level at natural and drained areas. Significant increase in CH4 flux was detected for groundwater levels above 30 cm.

TI EFFECT OF A LOWERED WATER-TABLE ON NITROUS-OXIDE FLUXES FROM NORTHERN

ID CARBON-DIOXIDE; CLIMATE CHANGE; METHANE FLUX; FENS
AB NORTHERN peatlands contain 20-30% of the total organic nitrogen and carbon in the world's soils1,2, and thus they apparently have the potential to exert a significant influence on the global atmospheric budget of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide (N2O).  In the drier, warmer summer conditions predicted at high latitudes by some climate models3,4 as a result of greenhouse-gas forcing, northern peatlands would become drier, increasing the rate of mineralization of organic matter1,5 and of the microbial processes that produce N2O. These regions might therefore be expected to exert a strong feedback on climate. But whereas methane emissions have been well studied6,7, little is known about the effect on N2O fluxes of changes in the level of peatland water tables. Here we present a comparison of present-day N2O fluxes from virgin peatlands in Finland with those from sites in the same regions that were drained by ditching 30 and 50 years ago. The lowered water table had no effect on N2O emissions from nutrient-poor peat but enhanced those from nutrient-rich peat. We estimate that equivalent drying caused by climate change would increase the total emissions of N2O from northern peatlands by 0.03-0.1 teragrams of nitrogen per year, which is just 0.3-1% of the present global annual emissions. Thus northern peatlands are unlikely to exert a significant climate feedback from N2O emissions.

AB Drained peat soils are a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere. Rewetting these soils is considered an important climate change mitigation tool to reduce emissions and create suitable conditions for carbon sequestration. Long-term monitoring is essential to capture interannual variations in GHG emissions and associated environmental variables and to reduce the uncertainty linked with GHG emission factor calculations. In this study, we present GHG balances: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) calculated for a 5-year period at a rewetted industrial cutaway peatland in Ireland (rewetted 7years prior to the start of the study); and compare the results with an adjacent drained area (2-year data set), and with ten long-term data sets from intact (i.e. undrained) peatlands in temperate and boreal regions. In the rewetted site, CO2 exchange (or net ecosystem exchange (NEE)) was strongly influenced by ecosystem respiration (R-eco) rather than gross primary production (GPP). CH4 emissions were related to soil temperature and either water table level or plant biomass. N2O emissions were not detected in either drained or rewetted sites. Rewetting reduced CO2 emissions in unvegetated areas by approximately 50%. When upscaled to the ecosystem level, the emission factors (calculated as 5-year mean of annual balances) for the rewetted site were (+/- SD) -104 +/- 80g CO2-C m(-2)yr(-1) (i.e. CO2 sink) and 9 +/- 2g CH4-C m(-2)yr(-1) (i.e. CH4 source). Nearly a decade after rewetting, the GHG balance (100-year global warming potential) had reduced noticeably (i.e. less warming) in comparison with the drained site but was still higher than comparative intact sites. Our results indicate that rewetted sites may be more sensitive to interannual changes in weather conditions than their more resilient intact counterparts and may switch from an annual CO2 sink to a source if triggered by slightly drier conditions.

AB 1 We tested the influence of geographical gradients upon nutrient dynamics in the root environment of the vegetation of mires in north-eastern Poland and the Netherlands. The study areas show differences in the water level fluctuations, and atmospheric nitrogen deposition (the Netherlands, 50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1); Poland, 5-10 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)).
   2 Nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization, decomposition, denitrification and nitrous oxide emission were studied during 6 weeks in May-June and correlated with characteristics of the interstitial water and the soil. Five types of mires (herbaceous bog, forested bog, herbaceous rich-fen, river marginal fen and alder fen forest) were compared.
   3 Inorganic N as well as P release were faster in the Dutch than in the Polish mires of the same type. Denitrification and nitrous oxide emission were also faster in the Dutch mires, with the exception of the Polish alder forest, where denitrification was high because of high N richness and a strongly falling water table.
   4 Principal component analysis of 18 physical and chemical soil and interstitial water variables resulted in four components: I, 'soil redox status'; II, 'soil base status'; III, 'interstitial water nutrient richness'; IV, 'soil P richness'. In multiple regressions, N mineralization correlated positively with component III, P release with components III and IV, and cellulose decomposition with components II and IV. Both denitrification and nitrous oxide emission correlated positively with components I and II.
   5 It was concluded that the lower P release rates in the Polish compared to the Dutch mires were due to higher calcium levels and lower summer water tables, which was partly attributed to the Polish continental climate. The higher rates for N mineralization, denitrification, nitrous oxide emission and cellulose decomposition in the Dutch sites were attributed to the high N deposition in the Netherlands.

AB Restoration of extracted horticultural peatlands commonly includes distribution of vegetation and propagules from nearby undisturbed sites over the recently-exposed surface. The resulting growth includes both mosses and vascular plants, which are important contributors to returning a peatland to a net carbon-storing ecosystem. Nitrous oxide (N2O) flux has not been widely investigated in these restored ecosystems. We compared the N2O flux from plots containing a vascular plant, Eriophorum vaginatum, to plots lacking vascular plant cover at a recently restored peatland. We hypothesized that E. vaginatum would result in decreased N2O emissions compared to areas with only moss or bare peat due to rapid plant uptake of peat nitrogen. After an early-summer pulse of emitted N2O, study plots containing E. vaginatum transitioned to net consumers of N2O while bare plots remained sources as the summer progressed. Furthermore, E. vaginatum growing in the wettest parts of the study site also had significantly more extractable nitrogen in pore water collected from 75 cm below the surface, beyond the depth of most roots. We suggest the priming effect driven by the roots of this vascular plant, combined with high water levels, frees some nitrogen from previously-inaccessible recalcitrant organic matter that then is taken up by plant roots and/or soil microorganisms, preventing its release as N2O. Vascular plants may play important roles in both greenhouse gas processes and in the nutrient cycles of restored peatlands and these complex processes need further investigation to guide effective restoration efforts that aim to return these disturbed ecosystems to net greenhouse gas sinks.

AB Peat wetlands are of major importance for ecosystem services such as carbon storage, water regulation and maintenance of biodiversity. However, peat drainage for farming leads to CO2 emission, soil subsidence and biodiversity losses. In the peat areas in the Netherlands, solutions are sought in reducing drainage, adapting farming to wetter soils, and converting productive dairy grasslands to less intensively managed semi-natural grasslands. Our objective was to compare the soil ecology and related ecosystem services of dairy and semi-natural grasslands on peat soils (Terric Histosols). Soil biotic and abiotic parameters were measured in twenty dairy and twenty semi-natural sites, with particular focus on (i) soil faunal diversity (ecosystem service "maintenance of biodiversity"), (ii) CO2 emission ("climate regulation"), (iii) water infiltration ("water regulation") and (iv) soil fertility ("grass production"). Mean soil faunal taxonomic richness per site (alpha diversity) was higher in dairy grasslands compared to semi-natural grasslands. However, the total observed number of taxa (gamma diversity) in dairy grassland was 13% lower for soil fauna and 21% lower when including plant species. Potential C mineralization rate in the topsoil - used as a proxy for CO2 emission - was not influenced by land use but was limited by drought. Additionally, potential C mineralization depended on different C sources and microbial groups in the two grassland types. Water infiltration rate differed by a factor of five between land use types (dairy > semi-natural), and correlated with soil porosity. As expected, soil fertility was higher in dairy than in semi-natural grasslands. However, potential N mineralization was similar in dairy and semi-natural grasslands and was correlated negatively with bacterial biomass apparently indicating N immobilization, and positively with bacterial growth that depended on labile C and N in soil. Our study on peat soils shows that dairy versus semi-natural grassland use influences biodiversity, climate regulation, water regulation and (potential for) grassland production. We conclude with recommendations for land management to optimize the delivery of those ecosystem services.

AB Northern peatlands play an important role in the regulation of the atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) balance, functioning as a net carbon sink with low rates of organic decomposition. However, perturbations such as drainage increase peat oxidation, which may lead to enhanced gaseous release of carbon. For this reason, the number of restoration projects that aim to rewet blanket bogs has increased in the last few years, but there is still a lack of understanding of the impact of restoration on emissions of greenhouse gases, such as methane, particularly in sites restored from forestry. In this paper, we investigate the seasonal greenhouse gas dynamics in a forest-to-bog restoration site in Scotland. We analyse the effects of restoration on both carbon dioxide and methane fluxes, and investigate which site factors (microtopography, vegetation type, soil moisture and temperature) drive the processes of gaseous exchange between the bog surface and the atmosphere. Our results show that the original surface is near greenhouse gase equilibrium at -0.28 gCO(2)eq m(2)center dot day(-1) and that microtopographic features act as a net greenhouse gas sink (ridges = -0.94 gCO(2)eq m(2)center dot day(-1) and furrows = -0.86 gCO(2)eq m(2)center dot day(-1)), whereas the bog pool is a net source of greenhouse gases (0.98 gCO(2)eq m(2)center dot day(-1)). We found different vegetation species play a key role in greenhouse gas flux dynamics, especially in forestry-derived microtopographical features, and their presence and influence on greenhouse gas dynamics should be accounted for to provide a more comprehensive understanding of emissions associated with restoration management practices.
   Highlights
   GHG (CO2 and CH4) dynamics in a boreal peatland restored from forestry are mainly affected by microtopography and vegetation.
   Forestry-derived microforms (ridges and furrows) are better GHG sinks than pools (GHG emitters) and original surfaces (near GHG equilibrium).
   The presence of Trichophorum cespitosum leads to higher CH4 emissions.
   Restoration practices like terraforming may create a short-term pulse net GHG emission due to an increase of both CH4 and CO2 fluxes.

AB Global peatlands store more carbon than is naturally present in the atmosphere(1,2). However, many peatlands are under pressure from drainage-based agriculture, plantation development and fire, with the equivalent of around 3 per cent of all anthropogenic greenhouse gases emitted from drained peatland(3-5). Efforts to curb such emissions are intensifying through the conservation of undrained peatlands and re-wetting of drained systems(6). Here we report eddy covariance data for carbon dioxide from 16 locations and static chamber measurements for methane from 41 locations in the UK and Ireland. We combine these with published data from sites across all major peatland biomes. We find that the mean annual effective water table depth (WTDe; that is, the average depth of the aerated peat layer) overrides all other ecosystem- and management-related controls on greenhouse gas fluxes. We estimate that every 10 centimetres of reduction in WTDe could reduce the net warming impact of CO2 and CH4 emissions (100-year global warming potentials) by the equivalent of at least 3 tonnes of CO2 per hectare per year, until WTDe is less than 30 centimetres. Raising water levels further would continue to have a net cooling effect until WTDe is within 10 centimetres of the surface. Our results suggest that greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands drained for agriculture could be greatly reduced without necessarily halting their productive use. Halving WTDe in all drained agricultural peatlands, for example, could reduce emissions by the equivalent of over 1 per cent of global anthropogenic emissions.

AB Radiocarbon (C-14) is a key tracer for detecting the mobilization of previously stored terrestrial organic carbon (C) into aquatic systems. Old C (>1,000years BP) may be masked by postbomb C (fixed from the atmosphere post-1950 CE), potentially rendering bulk aquatic dissolved organic C (DOC) C-14 measurements insensitive to old C. We collected DOC with a modern C-14 signature from a temperate Scottish peatland stream and decomposed it to produce CO2 under simulated natural conditions over 140days. We measured the C-14 of both DOC and CO2 at seven time points and found that while DOC remained close to modern in age, the resultant CO2 progressively increased in age up to 2,356767years BP. The results of this experiment demonstrate that the bulk (DOC)-C-14 pool can hide the presence of old C within peatland stream DOC export, demonstrating that bulk (DOC)-C-14 measurements can be an insensitive indicator of peatland disturbance. Our experiment also demonstrates that this old C component is biologically and photochemically available for conversion to the greenhouse gas CO2, and as such, bulk (DOC)-C-14 measurements do not reflect the C-14 signature of the labile organic C pool exported by inland water systems more broadly. Moreover, our experiment suggests that old C may be an important component of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from peatland aquatic systems, with implications for tracing and modeling interactions between the hydrological and terrestrial C cycles.
   Plain Language Summary The introduction of old carbon previously stored in soils for thousands of years into rivers can increase the net flux of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, impacting global climate. This is because rivers transport the equivalent of one third of human carbon emissions annually from land to the oceans. Much river-borne carbon is plant and soil (organic) matter that can decompose during transport, releasing greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Radiocarbon dating can reveal the age of river-borne carbon, but previous measurements may have underestimated the age of carbon released into rivers by not considering the potential for old carbon hidden within individual bulk water samples. Using an incubation experiment, we demonstrate that dissolved organic carbon from a Scottish peatland stream that would be considered modern in age using traditional bulk radiocarbon dating can readily decompose to produce carbon dioxide with an old radiocarbon signature up to similar to 2,500years old. This demonstrates that radiocarbon dating of bulk riverine dissolved organic carbon can hide the presence of old carbon. Furthermore, these results indicate that old carbon may be more common in the global carbon cycle than previously thought, with important implications for our understanding and modeling of peatland ecosystems.

   PEATLANDS; CO2 EXCHANGE; CH4 FLUXES; N2O; TILLAGE; GRASS; FORESTRY
AB Management of peat soils is regionally important as they cover large land areas and have important but conflicting ecosystems services. A recent management trend for drained peatlands is the control of greenhouse gases (GHG) by changes in agricultural practices, peatland restoration or paludiculture. Due to complex antagonistic controls of moisture, water table management can be difficult to use as a method for controlling GHG emissions. Past studies show that there is no obvious relationship between GHG emission rates and crop type, tillage intensity or fertilization rates. For drained peat soils, the best use options can vary from rewetting with reduced emission to efficient short term use to maximize the, profit per amount of greenhouse gas emitted. The GHG accounting should consider the entire life cycle of the peatland and the socio-economic benefits peatlands provide locally. Cultivating energy crops is a viable option especially for wet peat soils with poor drainage, but harvesting remains a challenge due to tractability of wet soils. Paludiculture in lowland floodplains can be a tool to mitigate regional flooding allowing water to be stored on these lands without much harm to crops. This can also increase regional biodiversity providing important habitats for birds and moisture tolerant plant species. However, on many peatlands rewetting is not possible due to their position in the landscape and the associated difficulty to maintain a high stable water table. While the goal of rewetting often is to encourage the return of peat forming plants and the ecosystem services they provide such as carbon sequestration, it is not well known if these plants will grow on peat soils that have been altered by the process of drainage and management. Therefore, it is important to consider peat quality and hydrology when choosing management options. Mapping of sites is recommended as a management tool to guide actions. The environmental status and socio-economic importance of the sites should be assessed both for continued cultivation but also for other ecosystem services such as restoration and hydrological functions (flood control). Farmers need advice, tools and training to find the best after-use option. Biofuels might provide a cost-efficient after use option for some sites. Peat extraction followed by rewetting might provide a sustainable option as rewetting is often easier if the peat is removed, starting the peat accumulation from scratch. Also this provides a way to finance the after-use. As impacts of land use are uncertain, new policies should consider multiple benefits and decisions should be based on scientific evidence and field scale observations. The need to further understand the key processes and long term effects of field scale land use manipulations is evident. The recommended actions for peatlands should be based on local condition and socio-economic needs to outline intermediate and long term plans. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Northern peatlands are important carbon (C) reservoirs, storing about one-third of the global terrestrial soil C pool. Anthropogenic influences, such as drainage for agriculture and forestry, lower the originally high groundwater level, leading to peat aeration and decomposition. This is particularly reflected in significant losses of CO2, while fluxes of N2O and CH4 are generally considered of minor importance for the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of cultivated peatlands in Scandinavia. Setting land aside from agricultural production has been proposed as a strategy to reduce GHG emissions from drained peatland, restore natural habitats, and increase C sequestration. However, the evidence for this is rather scarce unless drainage is terminated. In this study, we measured respiration using dark automatic chambers, and CO2, N2O, and CH4 fluxes using manual static chambers, on: 1) cultivated peatland and 2) adjacent set-aside peatland in Central Sweden. The set-aside site was found to be a greater source of respiration than the cultivated site, while higher N2O fluxes and lower CH4 uptake rates were observed for the cultivated site. However, to compare the full GHG balance and assess the abandonment of drained cultivated peatland, additional measures, such as gross primary production (GPP) but also dissolved organic C losses would have to be taken into account.

AB The cultivation of Sphagnum mosses on re-wetted peat bogs for use in horticulture is a new land use strategy. We provide the first greenhouse gas balances for a field-scale Sphagnum farming experiment on former bog grassland, in its establishment phase. Over two years we used closed chambers to make measurements of GHG exchange on production strips of Sphagnum palustre L. and Sphagnum papillosum Lindb. and on irrigation ditches. Methane fluxes of both Sphagnum species showed a significant decrease over the study period. This trend was stronger for S. papillosum. In contrast, the estimated CO2 fluxes did not show a significant temporal trend over the study period. The production strips of both Sphagnum species were net GHG sinks of 5-9 t ha(-1) a(-1) (in CO2-equivalents) during the establishment phase of the moss carpets. In comparison, the ditches were a CO2 source instead of a CO2 sink and emitted larger amounts of CH4, resulting in net GHG release of similar to 11 t ha(-1) a(-1) CO2-equivalents. We conclude that Sphagnum farming fields should be designed to minimise the area covered by irrigation ditches. Overall, Sphagnum farming on bogs has lower on-field GHG emissions than low-intensity agriculture.

AB We compared greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and albedo of a pristine boreal bog and an adjacent abandoned peatland pasture in western Newfoundland, Canada to estimate the magnitude of radiative forcing (RF) created by agricultural drainage and abandonment. Our results indicated that these anthropogenic activities induced a climate cooling effect (negative RF), with the magnitude of the RF caused by the albedo change comparable to that induced by altered GHGs. Although the albedo-induced RF was positive in winter and negative in summer, the summer effect dominated because of greater solar radiation received. The climate cooling effect of GHGs change was due to an increase in the carbon dioxide sink capacity and a reduction in methane emissions under lower water table levels following agricultural drainage and abandonment. Calculation of sustained-flux global warming/cooling potentials also supported this finding. Our results show that the overall increase in albedo resulting from agricultural drainage and abandonment contributes significantly to the negative RF, strengthening the cooling effect due to the changing GHG fluxes. Therefore, changes in albedo due to altered vegetation coverage and hydrology and GHG fluxes should be considered when assessing the climatic impacts from land-use change in northern peatland.

AB Wetland restoration on peat islands previously drained for agriculture has potential to reverse land subsidence and sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide as peat accretes. However, the emission of methane could potentially offset the greenhouse gas benefits of captured carbon. As microbial communities play a key role in governing wetland greenhouse gas fluxes, we are interested in how microbial community composition and functions are associated with wetland hydrology, biogeochemistry, and methane emission, which is critical to modeling the microbial component in wetland methane fluxes and to managing restoration projects for maximal carbon sequestration. Here, we couple sequence-based methods with biogeochemical and greenhouse gas measurements to interrogate microbial communities from a pilot-scale restored wetland in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California, revealing considerable spatial heterogeneity even within this relatively small site. A number of microbial populations and functions showed strong correlations with electron acceptor availability and methane production; some also showed a preference for association with plant roots. Marker gene phylogenies revealed a diversity of major methane-producing and -consuming populations and suggested novel diversity within methanotrophs. Methanogenic archaea were observed in all samples, as were nitrate-, sulfate-, and metal-reducing bacteria, indicating that no single terminal electron acceptor was preferred despite differences in energetic favorability and suggesting spatial microheterogeneity and microniches. Notably, methanogens were negatively correlated with nitrate-, sulfate-, and metal-reducing bacteria and were most abundant at sampling sites with high peat accretion and low electron acceptor availability, where methane production was highest.
   IMPORTANCE Wetlands are the largest nonanthropogenic source of atmospheric methane but also a key global carbon reservoir. Characterizing belowground microbial communities that mediate carbon cycling in wetlands is critical to accurately predicting their responses to changes in land management and climate. Here, we studied a restored wetland and revealed substantial spatial heterogeneity in biogeochemistry, methane production, and microbial communities, largely associated with the wetland hydraulic design. We observed patterns in microbial community composition and functions correlated with biogeochemistry and methane production, including diverse microorganisms involved in methane production and consumption. We found that methanogenesis gene abundance is inversely correlated with genes from pathways exploiting other electron acceptors, yet the ubiquitous presence of genes from all these pathways suggests that diverse electron acceptors contribute to the energetic balance of the ecosystem. These investigations represent an important step toward effective management of wetlands to reduce methane flux to the atmosphere and enhance belowground carbon storage.

AB Peatland restoration may provide a potential after-use option to mitigate the negative climate impact of abandoned peat extraction areas; currently, however, knowledge about restoration effects on the annual balances of carbon (C) and greenhouse gas (GHG) exchanges is still limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of contrasting mean water table levels (WTLs) on the annual C and GHG balances of restoration treatments with high (Res(H)) and low (Res(L)) WTL relative to an unrestored bare peat (BP) site. Measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were conducted over a full year using the closed chamber method and complemented by measurements of abiotic controls and vegetation cover. Three years following restoration, the difference in the mean WTL resulted in higher bryophyte and lower vascular plant cover in Res(H) relative to Res(L). Consequently, greater gross primary production and autotrophic respiration associated with greater vascular plant cover were observed in Res(L) compared to Res(H). However, the means of the measured net ecosystem CO2 exchanges (NEE) were not significantly different between Res(H) and Res(L). Similarly, no significant differences were observed in the respective means of CH4 and N2O exchanges. In comparison to the two restored sites, greater net CO2, similar CH4 and greater N2O emissions occurred in BP. On the annual scale, Res(H), Res(L) and BP were C sources of 111, 103 and 268 g Cm-2 yr(-1) and had positive GHG balances of 4.1, 3.8 and 10.2 tCO(2) eq ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Thus, the different WTLs had a limited impact on the C and GHG balances in the two restored treatments 3 years following restoration. However, the C and GHG balances in Res(H) and Res(L) were considerably lower than in BP due to the large reduction in CO2 emissions. This study therefore suggests that restoration may serve as an effective method to mitigate the negative climate impacts of abandoned peat extraction areas.

AB Northern peatlands have been accumulating organic matter since the start of the Holocene, and are now a substantial store of terrestrial carbon. However, their current status as carbon sinks is less clear, because of the possible effects of climate change, air pollution, grazing and drainage etc., and the difficulties of accurate measurement with suitable time resolution. Such measurements are particularly lacking in the UK. Here, we present multi-year eddy covariance measurements of the carbon fluxes at a relatively undisturbed ombrotrophic blanket bog in the Flow Country of northern Scotland. The site consistently acted as a moderate sink for CO2 over all the measurement years (mean net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of -114 g C m(-2) y(-1)), similar in magnitude to other measurements in the boreal and tundra zones, and rather higher than the existing measurements at other sites in the UK and Ireland. Generally, the NEE of CO2 was relatively insensitive to moderate inter-annual variations in weather. Non-CO2 losses comprised 11% of gross primary production, mainly from methane emissions. Accounting for these terms, the net ecosystem carbon balance was -50 g C-CO2 eq m(-2) y(-1). The contemporary carbon sink was larger than estimates from local peat cores, based on peat accumulation over the last several thousand years, but in the middle of the range of estimates which used spheroidal carbonaceous particles to estimate peat accumulation rates over the last century.

AB \ Northern peatlands have accumulated a large amount of organic carbon (C) in their thick peat profile. Climate change and associated variations in soil environments are expected to have significant impacts on the C balance of these ecosystems, but the magnitude is still highly uncertain. Verifying and understanding the influences of changes in environmental factors on C gas fluxes in biogeochemical models are essential for forecasting feedbacks between C gas fluxes and climate change. In this study, we applied a biogeochemical model, DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC), to assess impacts of air temperature (T-A) and water table (WT) on C gas fluxes in an Alaskan peatland. DNDC was validated against field measurements of net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and CH4 fluxes under manipulated surface soil temperature and WT conditions in a moderate rich fen. The validation demonstrates that DNDC was able to capture the observed impacts of the manipulations in soil environments on C gas fluxes. To investigate responses of C gas fluxes to changes in T-A and soil water condition, we conducted a series of simulations with varying T-A and WT. The results demonstrate that (1) uptake rates of CO2 at the site were reduced by either too colder or warmer temperatures and generally increased with increasing soil moisture; (2) CH4 emissions showed an increasing trend as T-A increased or WT rose toward the peat surface; and (3) the site could shift from a net greenhouse gas (GHG) sink into a net GHG source under some warm and/or dry conditions. A sensitivity analysis evaluated the relative importance of T-A and WT to C gas fluxes. The results indicate that both T-A and WT played important roles in regulating NEE and CH4 emissions and that within the investigated ranges of the variations in T-A and WT, changes in WT showed a greater impact than changes in T-A on NEE, CH4 fluxes, and net C gas fluxes at the study fen.

AB The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California was drained and converted to agriculture more than a century ago, and since then has experienced extreme rates of soil subsidence from peat oxidation. To reverse subsidence and capture carbon there is increasing interest in converting drained agricultural land-use types to flooded conditions. Rice agriculture is proposed as a flooded land-use type with CO2 sequestration potential for this region. We conducted two years of simultaneous eddy covariance measurements at a conventional drained and grazed degraded peatland and a newly converted rice paddy to evaluate the impact of drained to flooded land-use change on CO2, CH4, and evaporation fluxes. We found that the grazed degraded peatland emitted 175-299 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) as CO2 and 3.3 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) as CH4, while the rice paddy sequestered 84-283 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) of CO2 from the atmosphere and released 2.5-6.6 g-C m(-2) yr(-1) as CH4. The rice paddy evaporated 45-95% more water than the grazed degraded peatland. Annual photosynthesis was similar between sites, but flooding at the rice paddy inhibited ecosystem respiration, making it a net CO2 sink. The rice paddy had reduced rates of soil subsidence due to oxidation compared with the drained peatland, but did not completely reverse subsidence. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Past land use change has converted vast areas of Northern peatland by drainage to agricultural or forested land. This change often reduces the greenhouse gas (GHG) sink strength of peatlands or turns them even from sinks to sources, which affects the global climate. Therefore, there is a need for suitable mitigation options for GHG emissions from drained peatlands. Addition of wood ash to peatland forests has been suggested as such a measure, but the overall effect on the global warming potential (GWP) of these ecosystems is still unclear. In order to fill this knowledge gap, we investigated three drained peatland forests in Sweden that had been fertilized with wood ash and monitored stand growth as well as the GHG emissions from soil, i.e. net effluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Our results show that over the first five to eight years after wood ash application, tree growth was enhanced at all sites. This was accompanied by generally little changes in the GHG emissions. Overall, we found that wood ash application reduced the GWP of drained peatland forests. Even though that our study was limited to eight years after wood ash application, we can conclude that in the short term wood ash application may be a suitable mitigation option for GHG emissions from Northern drained peatland forests.

AB Drainage and cultivation of peat soils almost always result in rapid soil degradation and a loss of soil organic matter (SOM). Winter cover crop cultivation and subsequent incorporation and watertable elevation have been considered as potential strategies to improve soil quality and decrease nutrient loss in drained and cultivated peatlands. However, the combined effect of residue incorporation and watertable management on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in these highly productive fen peat soils remains unknown. In the present study, two winter cover crops with contrasting carbon/nitrogen ratios (vetch [Vicia sativa], 45-60; rye [Secale cereale], 13-14) were incorporated into peat soils as green manure (without extra synthetic/organic N addition) at two watertable depths (-50 and -30 cm). Our results showed that fast mineralization of incorporated residues can cause a large pulse of GHG release under favourable environmental conditions. Both vetch and rye incorporation increased CO2 emissions compared with the bare soil treatments due to labile C addition and removal of N constraints. However, the two cover crops had strongly contrasting effects on N2O emissions. Incorporation of low C/N ratio vetch stimulated N2O emissions (average 21.8 +/- 7.3 mg N m(-2) hr(-1)) compared with the bare soil treatments, whereas high C/N ratio rye decreased N2O emissions (average 0.09 +/- 0.03 mg N m(-2) hr(-1)). Raising the watertable slightly reduced CO2 emissions from an average of 1.3 +/- 0.4 (the bare soils) to 0.9 +/- 0.3 g C m(-2) hr(-1) by inhibiting SOM mineralization but significantly increased N2O emissions in the vetch treatments by stimulating denitrification. CH4 fluxes were not affected by watertable depth, and their contribution to total global warming potential was negligible. Therefore, we conclude that high C/N ratio cover crops (e.g., rye) in combination with a raised watertable may represent a viable management option to mitigate GHG fluxes in fen peat soils.

AB Land-use conversion of pristine boreal peatlands for agricultural purposes is an ongoing process and projected to become more intensive with rising population growth and increased demands for food production. However, agricultural use of peatlands affects the production and emission of nitrous oxide (N2O), a very potent greenhouse gas currently gaining more attention in the global assessment of greenhouse gases. While the intensity of N2O emissions depends on a range of environmental factors, including hydrological parameters, temperature and the availability of nitrogen in soils, key driving processes remain poorly understood. In order to understand the effects of land-use change on the peatland ecosystem, we quantified N2O fluxes under different land-use in a comparative study between a natural bog and an adjacent abandoned pasture in Newfoundland, Canada. We conducted in situ gas flux measurements using the static chamber method over five growing seasons. In addition, we measured photosynthetic rates and environmental parameters, namely soil temperature and moisture, water table and concentrations of total nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon in pore waters. According to previous studies, we hypothesized higher N2O emissions from the abandoned pasture due to drainage compared to the natural bog. However, despite significant differences of environmental parameters and photosynthetic rates, we found no significant difference of N2O fluxes between the two sites. We argue that N2O production at the abandoned pasture was inhibited due to exhaustion of plant-available nitrogen as a result of increased gross primary production compared to the natural bog. We conclude that the effect of drainage and fertilization on N2O fluxes during the growing season was superposed by vegetation composition change effects at the abandoned pasture, leading to similar N2O fluxes at both sites.

AB Worldwide, drainage-based water management is applied to facilitate agricultural use of coastal peatland areas, leading to large-scale peat oxidation and land subsidence. Meanwhile, there is a strong call for a more sustainable use and management of drained peatlands. Drainage severely enhances greenhouse gas emission and land subsidence, which can be counteracted by rewetting. However, this advocated alternative may also induce unwanted processes affecting ecosystem functioning. In this overview we discuss the complex biogeochemical responses related to drainage and rewetting in peatlands and compare the biogeochemical effects of deep drainage to those of rewetting in order to identify the most sustainable management strategy for drained coastal peatlands. Due to drainage, oxidation of the iron sulphide pool leads to a highly underestimated source of sulphate for adjacent surface waters, indirectly enhancing eutrophication. Although rewetting also enhances eutrophication by mobilisation and discharge of phosphorus to surface waters, we propose this effect may be mitigated by co-discharged iron, binding phosphorus. As rewetting is expected to reduce societal costs and maximises ecosystem services of peatlands, we suggest to rewet drained agricultural peatlands wherever feasible. We discuss several promising, more sustainable, land use alternatives for rewetted coastal peatlands.

AB Managed northern peatlands are an important source of the strong greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). However, N2O emissions from these managed peatlands display a high spatial variability, and processes governing N2O production and emissions from these ecosystems are still not well understood. To constrain the factors regulating N2O emissions from managed northern peat soils, we determined a wide set of soil physical and chemical properties of peatlands with different management histories spread across Finland, Sweden and Iceland. We included eleven peatland sites with available in situ N2O flux data, and complemented our analyses with detailed measurements of soil nitrogen (N) cycling processes such as N2O production, gross N mineralization and gross nitrification and, in addition, soil microbial biomass. This study included drained peatlands with different land-use types and management intensities, comprising forested, cultivated or only drained peatlands and afforested or abandoned agricultural peatlands. All selected peatland sites displayed a low soil carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of 15-27, traditionally used to predict high N2O emissions. Despite the narrow C/N range, the N2O emissions at our sites varied greatly within and between land-use groups, ranging from 0.03 to 2.38 g N m(-2) y(-1). Thus, our findings provide valuable insights into the regulatory factors underlying the variability in N2O emissions and show that a low C/N ratio in managed peatlands cannot be used to predict high N2O emissions. Instead, our results demonstrate that higher N2O emissions are linked to higher peat phosphorus (P) and copper (Cu) content, suggesting that low P and Cu concentrations can limit N2O production in peat even with sufficient N availability. While known factors such as soil moisture, oxygen content and the degree of peat humification partially explained the variability in N2O emissions, this study directly links soil P and Cu availability to N2O production processes. The availability of P and especially Cu seemed to promote nitrification activities, thereby increasing N2O production. Our study highlights the link between N2O emissions and soil P and Cu availability and the strong coupling of the soil N and P cycles in peatlands, which is to date severely understudied.

AB Peatlands drained for agriculture are sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Resulting emissions may depend on land-use, often as grassland or cropland, but few studies have directly compared the effects of land-uses. Here, we measured annual emissions of CO2, N2O and methane (CH4) from five sites in a temperate bog, representing an undrained natural bog (NB) site, and four drained sites used as permanent grassland (PG) and croplands with rotations of oat-potato, oat-spring barley and potato-spring barley (PO:SB) in the study year. Gas fluxes were measured at 1-2 week intervals using static chambers, and auxiliary data were obtained, such as temperature, depth of water table, ratio-vegetation index, pH and soil mineral N. Annual CO2 emissions were derived from empirical modelling, whereas CH4 and N2O emissions were linearly interpolated between measurement dates by bootstrapping. Soil respiration was lower at the NB site (1.8 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1)) than at the drained sites where emissions were in the range of 5.0-8.8 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1). The N2O emission was negligible at NB (0.3 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)), low at three of the drained sites (1.5-3.7 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)), but high at PO:SB (37.7 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)). The CH4 emission was high at NB (172 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1)), but negligible at the drained sites (-1.5 to 1.5 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1)). The soil respiration at the drained sites indicated that peat losses were rather similar among the different cropping systems and depended mostly on drainage status, although soil respiration and peat mineralization may not scale directly. The pattern of N2O emissions suggested an increased risk of N2O emission from potato cultivation before and after the period of potato growth, likely due to microbial availability of NO3- outside the growing season. For initiatives aiming at reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural peat soils, this means that, e.g., conversion from cropland to permanent grassland should preferably be accompanied by measures of rewetting, whereas for potato cropping, N availability outside the growing season should be minimized.

AB Agricultural drainage of organic soils has resulted in vast soil subsidence and contributed to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California was drained over a century ago for agriculture and human settlement and has since experienced subsidence rates that are among the highest in the world. It is recognized that drained agriculture in the Delta is unsustainable in the long-term, and to help reverse subsidence and capture carbon (C) there is an interest in restoring drained agricultural land-use types to flooded conditions. However, flooding may increase methane (CH4) emissions. We conducted a full year of simultaneous eddy covariance measurements at two conventional drained agricultural peatlands (a pasture and a corn field) and three flooded land-use types (a rice paddy and two restored wetlands) to assess the impact of drained to flooded land-use change on CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the Delta. We found that the drained sites were net C and greenhouse gas (GHG) sources, releasing up to 341g Cm(-2)yr(-1) as CO2 and 11.4g Cm(-2)yr(-1) as CH4. Conversely, the restored wetlands were net sinks of atmospheric CO2, sequestering up to 397g Cm(-2)yr(-1). However, they were large sources of CH4, with emissions ranging from 39 to 53g Cm(-2)yr(-1). In terms of the full GHG budget, the restored wetlands could be either GHG sources or sinks. Although the rice paddy was a small atmospheric CO2 sink, when considering harvest and CH4 emissions, it acted as both a C and GHG source. Annual photosynthesis was similar between sites, but flooding at the restored sites inhibited ecosystem respiration, making them net CO2 sinks. This study suggests that converting drained agricultural peat soils to flooded land-use types can help reduce or reverse soil subsidence and reduce GHG emissions.

AB Northern peatlands have accumulated large stocks of organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), but their spatial distribution and vulnerability to climate warming remain uncertain. Here, we used machine-learning techniques with extensive peat core data (n > 7,000) to create observation-based maps of northern peatland C and N stocks, and to assess their response to warming and permafrost thaw. We estimate that northern peatlands cover 3.7 +/- 0.5 million km(2) and store 415 +/- 150 Pg C and 10 +/- 7 Pg N. Nearly half of the peatland area and peat C stocks are permafrost affected. Using modeled global warming stabilization scenarios (from 1.5 to 6 degrees C warming), we project that the current sink of atmospheric C (0.10 +/- 0.02 Pg C.y(-1)) in northern peatlands will shift to a C source as 0.8 to 1.9 million km 2 of permafrost-affected peatlands thaw. The projected thaw would cause peatland greenhouse gas emissions equal to similar to 1% of anthropogenic radiative forcing in this century. The main forcing is from methane emissions (0.7 to 3 Pg cumulative CH4-C) with smaller carbon dioxide forcing (1 to 2 Pg CO2-C) and minor nitrous oxide losses. We project that initial CO2-C losses reverse after similar to 200 y, as warming strengthens peatland C-sinks. We project substantial, but highly uncertain, additional losses of peat into fluvial systems of 10 to 30 Pg C and 0.4 to 0.9 Pg N. The combined gaseous and fluvial peatland C loss estimated here adds 30 to 50% onto previous estimates of permafrost-thaw C losses, with southern permafrost regions being the most vulnerable.

AB On a global scale, the release of greenhouse gases (GHG) from peatland drainage and cultivation are believed to account for similar to 5% of estimated anthropogenic GHG emissions. Drainage generally leads to peat subsidence and extensive soil loss, resulting in a diminishing store of soil carbon (C). This is a challenge for maintaining drainage -based agriculture, as such practices will eventually lead to the loss of organic soils that arable cultivation depends on. The conversion of croplands on peat to semi-natural grasslands, alongside raising water tables, is one possible way to reduce the loss of these valuable C stores. Here, we report the net ecosystem carbon balances (NECB) of two lowland peatlands in East Anglia, south-east UK. One site is a relic conservation-managed fen on deep peat, subject to active hydrological management to maintain water levels, and dominated by Cladium and Phragmites sedge and reed beds, whilst the other is a former cropland that has been converted to seasonally inundated grazed grassland. Despite occasionally experiencing severe water table drawdown, the conservation managed fen was a strong C sink of-104 g C m(-2) yr(-1). In contrast, the grassland was a C source of 133 g C m(-2) yr(-1), with gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions being the main loss pathway, due to low water tables exposing the soil profile in summer. At each site, ditch emissions of CO2 were moderately large (22 and 37 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), whilst ditch methane (CH4) emissions (0.2 and 1.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) made a negligible contribution to the NECB, but are important when considering the ecosystem GHG balance in terms of CO2 equivalents. Excluding dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), fluvial C losses were 6 g C M-2 yr(-1) for the conservation-managed fen and 12 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the former cropland, and were dominated by dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The small fluvial C loss is the result of both sites being hydrologically isolated from the surrounding agricultural landscapes. Although the partially re-wetted cropland was still acting as a net C source, our estimates suggest that seasonal rewetting has reduced net annual C losses to similar to 20% of their former cropland values. Maintaining high water tables year round would potentially further reduce C losses, and shallow inundation might allow the return of wetland species such as Phragmites and Typha, perhaps as floating rafts.

AB Peatland ecosystems have been important global carbon sinks throughout the Holocene. Most of the research on peatland carbon budgets and effects of variable weather conditions has been done in Northern Hemisphere Sphagnum-dominated systems. Given their importance in other geographic and climatic regions, a better understanding of peatland carbon dynamics is needed across the spectrum of global peatland types. In New Zealand, much of the historic peatland area has been drained for agriculture but little is known about rates of carbon exchange and storage in unaltered peatland remnants that are dominated by the jointed wire rush, Empodisma robustum. We used eddy covariance to measure ecosystem-scale CO2 and CH4 fluxes and a water balance approach to estimate the sub-surface flux of dissolved organic carbon from the largest remaining raised peat bog in New Zealand, Kopuatai bog. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was estimated over four years, which included two drought summers, a relatively wet summer, and a meteorologically average summer. In all measurement years, the bog was a substantial sink for carbon, ranging from 134.7 to 216.9 gCm(-2) yr(-1), owing to the large annual net ecosystem production (161.8 to 244.9 gCO(2)-Cm-2 yr(-1)). Annual methane fluxes were large relative to most Northern Hemisphere peatlands (14.2 to 21.9 gCH(4)-Cm-2 yr(-1)), although summer and autumn emissions were highly sensitive to dry conditions, leading to very predictable seasonality according to water table position. The annual flux of dissolved organic carbon was similar in magnitude to methane emissions but less variable, ranging from 11.7 to 12.8 gCm(-2) yr(-1). Dry conditions experienced during late summer droughts led to significant reductions in annual carbon storage, which resulted nearly equally from enhanced ecosystem respiration due to lowered water tables and increased temperatures, and from reduced gross primary production due to vapor pressure deficit-related stresses to the vegetation. However, the net C uptake of Kopuatai bog during drought years was large relative to even the maximum reported NECB from Northern Hemisphere bogs. Furthermore, global warming potential fluxes indicated the bog was a strong sink for greenhouse gases in all years despite the relatively large annual methane emissions. Our results suggest that adaptations of E. robustum to dry conditions lead to a resilient peatland drought response of the NECB.

AB Based on theories of mire development and responses to a changing climate, the current role of mires as a net carbon sink has been questioned. A rigorous evaluation of the current net C-exchange in mires requires measurements of all relevant fluxes. Estimates of annual total carbon budgets in mires are still very limited. Here, we present a full carbon budget over 2 years for a boreal minerogenic oligotrophic mire in northern Sweden (64 degrees 11'N, 19 degrees 33'E). Data on the following fluxes were collected: land-atmosphere CO2 exchange (continuous Eddy covariance measurements) and CH4 exchange (static chambers during the snow free period); TOC (total organic carbon) in precipitation; loss of TOC, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CH4 through stream water runoff (continuous discharge measurements and regular C-concentration measurements). The mire constituted a net sink of 27 +/- 3.4 (+/- SD) g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2004 and 20 +/- 3.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2005. This could be partitioned into an annual surface-atmosphere CO2 net uptake of 55 +/- 1.9 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2004 and 48 +/- 1.6 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2005. The annual NEE was further separated into a net uptake season, with an uptake of 92 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2004 and 86 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2005, and a net loss season with a loss of 37 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2004 and 38 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2005. Of the annual net CO2-C uptake, 37% and 31% was lost through runoff (with runoff TOC > DIC >> CH4) and 16% and 29% through methane emission during 2004 and 2005, respectively. This mire is still a significant C-sink, with carbon accumulation rates comparable to the long-term Holocene C-accumulation, and higher than the C-accumulation during the late Holocene in the region.

AB Peatland rewetting aims at stopping the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and establishing net carbon sinks. However, in times of global warming, restoration projects must increasingly deal with extreme events such as drought periods. Here, we evaluate the effect of the European summer drought 2018 on vegetation development and the exchange of methane (CH4) and CO(2)in two rewetted minerotrophic fens (Hutelmoor-Hte and Zarnekow-Zrk) including potential carry-over effects in the post-drought year. Drought was a major stress factor for the established vegetation but also promoted the rapid spread of new vegetation, which will likely gain a lasting foothold in Zrk. Accordingly, drought increased not only respiratory CO(2)losses but also photosynthetic CO(2)uptake. Altogether, the drought reduced the net CO(2)sink in Hte, while it stopped the persistent net CO(2)emissions of Zrk. In addition, the drought reduced CH(4)emissions in both fens, though this became most apparent in the post-drought year and suggests a lasting shift towards non-methanogenic organic matter decomposition. Occasional droughts can be beneficial for the restoration of the peatland carbon sink function if the newly grown vegetation increases CO(2)sequestration in the long term. Nonetheless, care must be taken to prevent extensive peat decay. This article is part of the theme issue 'Impacts of the 2018 severe drought and heatwave in Europe: from site to continental scale'.

AB Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) dynamics were studied in a boreal Sphagnum fuscum pine bog receiving annually (from 1991 to 1996) 30 or 100 kg NH4NO3-N ha(-1). The gas emissions were measured during the last three growing seasons of the experiment. Nitrogen treatment did not affect the CH4 fluxes in the microsites where S. fuscum and S. angustifolium dominated. However, addition of 100 kg NH4NO3-N ha(-1) yr(-1) increased the CH4 emission from those microsites dominated by S. fuscum. This increase was associated with the increase in coverage of cotton grass (Eriophorum vaginatum) induced by the nitrogen treatment. The differences in the CH4 emissions were not related to the CH4 oxidation and production potentials in the peat profiles. The N2O fluxes were negligible from all microsites. Only minor short-term increases occurred after the nitrogen addition.

AB Globally, peatlands store a large quantity of soil carbon that can be subsequently modified by hydrologic alterations from land-use change and climate change. However, there are many uncertainties in predicting how carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions are altered by long-term changes in hydrology. Therefore, the goal of this study was to quantify how multi-decadal manipulations of water table (WT) levels affected carbon cycling (plant production and net ecosystem exchange from three eddy covariance towers) in a peatland complex modified by levee construction, which created a wetter area up-gradient of the levee (mean WT was 12.1 cm below the surface), a dry area below the levee (36.8 cm), and an adjacent reference site not affected by the levee (21.6 cm). We found that mean total plant production was greatest in the reference site (311.9 g C m(-2) y(-1)), followed by the dry site (290.5 g C m(-2) y(-1)), and lowest in the wet site (227.1 g C m(-2) y(-1)). Net ecosystem exchange during the growing season was negative for all sites (sink), with the wet site having the greatest sink and the dry site having the lowest sink. Ecosystem respiration increased and CH4 emissions decreased with a decreasing WT level. This research demonstrates that human alteration of peatland WT levels can have long-term (> 50 years) consequences on peatland carbon cycling.

AB Drained peatlands, especially nitrogen (N) -rich ones, are sources of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere. As this emission is largely caused by N mineralization in oxic peat soil, rewetting the peat soil is likely to decrease the N2O emissions to similar levels with natural, undrained peatlands. Emissions from these water-saturated peat soils have often been assumed negligible, for example in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories. However, the number of published data of annual N2O emissions from undrained peatlands is small and even smaller for rewetted peatlands. Thus, we still have limited understanding of the effects of land-use change such as drainage and rewetting. We analyzed N2O flux data, mostly previously unpublished, from 28 undrained, 65 forestry-drained, and 24 rewetted boreal peatland study sites in Finland and calculated annual N2O emissions for each site, including emissions from ditches at 51 sites. We classified the sites into nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor ones, similar to the IPCC guidelines. Annual N2O emissions from the undrained peatlands were consistently small, but not negligible, averaging 0.11 and 0.10 g m-2a 1 in the nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor sites, respectively. Emissions from the drained peatlands were significantly higher than from the undrained peatlands in the nutrient-rich (mean 0.23 g m(-2) a(-1)) but not in the nutrient-poor (mean 0.08 g m(-2) a(-1)) sites. Emissions from the rewetted peatlands (means 0.05 and 0.08 g m(-2) a(-1) for nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor sites, respectively) were similar or lower than from the undrained ones. Emissions from ditches were similar to those from strips and correlated positively with strip emissions at the drained sites. Nutrient-rich soil (low CN ratio) and a low water table increased emissions significantly at the drained sites, whereas the continuously higher water tables kept emissions low at all undrained and rewetted sites. In conclusion, rewetting is an effective means to decrease the N2O emissions of nutrient-rich drained peatlands back to natural levels, although this natural level is not zero, as has been suggested earlier.

TI Greenhouse gas exchange of rewetted bog peat extraction sites and a
   Sphagnum cultivation site in northwest Germany

AB During the last decades an increasing area of drained peatlands has been rewetted. Especially in Germany, rewetting is the principal treatment on cutover sites when peat extraction is finished. The objectives are bog restoration and the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The first sites were rewetted in the 1980s. Thus, there is a good opportunity to study long-term effects of rewetting on greenhouse gas exchange, which has not been done so far on temperate cutover peatlands. Moreover, Sphagnum cultivating may become a new way to use cutover peatlands and agriculturally used peatlands as it permits the economical use of bogs under wet conditions. The climate impact of such measures has not been studied yet.
   We conducted a field study on the exchange of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide at three rewetted sites with a gradient from dry to wet conditions and at a Sphagnum cultivation site in NW Germany over the course of more than 2 years. Gas fluxes were measured using transparent and opaque closed chambers. The ecosystem respiration (CO2) and the net ecosystem exchange (CO2) were modelled at a high temporal resolution. Measured and modelled values fit very well together. Annually cumulated gas flux rates, net ecosystem carbon balances (NECB) and global warming potential (GWP) balances were determined. The annual net ecosystem exchange (CO2) varied strongly at the rewetted sites (from -201.7 +/- 126.8 to 29.7 +/- 112.7 gCO(2)-C m(-2) a(-1)) due to differing weather conditions, water levels and vegetation. The Sphagnum cultivation site was a sink of CO2 (-118.8 +/- 48.1 and -78.6 +/- 39.8 gCO(2)Cm(-2) a(-1)). The annual CH4 balances ranged between 16.2 +/- 2.2 and 24.2 +/- 5.0 gCH(4)-C-2 a(-1) at two inundated sites, while one rewetted site with a comparatively low water level and the Sphagnum farming site show CH4 fluxes close to 0. The net N2O fluxes were low and not significantly different between the four sites.
   The annual NECB was between -185.5 +/- 126.9 and 49.9 +/- 112.8 gCO(2)-Cm(-2)a(-1) at the rewetted sites and -115.8 +/- 48.1 and -77 +/- 39.8 gCO(2)Cm(-2)a(-1) at the Sphagnum cultivating site. The annual GWP100 balances ranged from -280.5 +/- 465.2 to 644.5 +/- 413.6 gCO(2)-eq.m(-2) a(-1) at the rewetted sites. In contrast, the Sphagnum farming site had a cooling impact on the climate in both years (-356.8 +/- 176.5 and -234.9 +/- 145.9 gCO(2)Cm(-2)a(-1)). If the carbon exported through the harvest of the Sphagnum biomass and the additional CO2 emission from the decay of the organic material is considered, the NECB and GWP100 balances are near neutral.
   Peat mining sites are likely to become net carbon sinks and a peat accumulating ("growing") peatland within 30 years of rewetting, but the GWP100 balance may still be positive. A recommended measure for rewetting is to achieve a water level of a few centimetres below ground.
   Sphagnum farming is a climate-friendly alternative to conventional commercial use of bogs. A year-round constant water level of a few centimetres below ground level should be maintained.

AB Rewetted peatlands are weak to negligible sources of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). However, rewetted peatlands in use for paludiculture may require nitrogen (N) fertilization potentially creating hot moments for denitrification and N2O emissions. In this study, we measured N2O emissions from an N-rich riparian fen for two consecutive years using static chambers. The field experiment included side-by-side plots cultivated with reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) under different degrees of manipulated rewetting. The treatments were defined as control, semi-flooded and flooded conditions corresponding to 2-year weighted mean groundwater table (GWT) depths of 9, 3 and 1 cm below soil surface, respectively. The crop was fertilized and harvested twice a year (160 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in two equal splits). Large N2O emissions were observed from all treatments after each fertilization event, which contributed to cumulative annual emissions of 3.2-6.0 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the first year and 1.8-4.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the second year. Emissions outside the fertilization periods were negligible. Annual N2O emissions were similar (P > 0.05) among the treatments in the first year whereas control treatments had the lowest emissions in the second year. Nitrogen removal in harvested biomass (197-218 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) exceeded the fertilizer N in all treatments, indicating that the cultivated biomass utilized substantial amounts of mineralized N from the peat soil. Overall, the results indicate that fertilizer-induced N2O emissions can be high although background soil emissions are low when high GWT is maintained on N-rich riparian peatland.

AB Reed canary grass (RCG, Phalaris arundinacea L.) is a suitable energy crop for cultivation in northern peatlands. However, the atmospheric impact of RCG cultivation as influenced by harvest frequency and fertilization is not clear. Here, we compared the biomass yield and greenhouse gas (GHG) balance for RCG cultivation in peatlands affected by cutting frequency and fertilizer managements. The managements included one-cut (OC) and two-cut (TC) systems that were either fertilized (TC-F) or unfertilized (TC-U) after the first cut in summer. Biomass yield of OC, TC-F and TC-U were 12, 16 and 11 Mg dry biomass per hectare per year, respectively. GHG fluxes of CO2, N2O and CH4 were measured with closed chamber techniques in the period between first and second (final) harvest of the TC managements, i.e. from 15 June to 23 September 2011. In the GHG monitoring period of 100 days, all systems were net sources of CO2 corresponding to 64 +/- 3, 217 +/- 15 and 50 +/- 23 g CO2-C m(-2) (mean +/- standard error, n = 3) from the OC, TC-F and TC-U systems, respectively. In the same period, emissions of N2O from TC-F were ten times higher as compared to OC and TC-U. Emissions of CH4 were negligible from all systems. The TC systems could not improve the GHG balance during cultivation (271, 663 and 210 g CO(2)e-C m(-2) emissions from the OC, TC-F and TC-U systems, respectively), but in a broader GHG life cycle perspective, the increased biomass yield by TC-F could replace more fossil fuel and offset at least some of the higher emissions from the system.

AB Minerotrophic mires (fens) represent an important part of the Northern peatlands (5*10(5) km(2)) and act as one of the most important sinks for terrestrial bond carbon and nitrogen. We have tried to clear up the influence of different management practices on nitrous oxide fluxes of these ecosystems. For this purpose investigations were performed on representative sites of the highly disturbed (degraded), N rich fen sites in Northeast Germany (5*10(3) ha): Paulinenaue (Rhin-Havelluch/Brandenburg, shallow cultivated grassland), Heinrichswalde (Friedlander Grobe Wiese/Mecklenburg-Vorpommem, deeply cultivated grassland), Muncheberg (Gumnitz, partially drained alder swamp forest). The annual flux rates showed a broad range. Especially newly drained fen sites (up to 26,9 kg N2O-N*ha(-1*)a(-1)) and grassland with high amounts of mineral fertilizer (480 kg N ha(-1) a(-1), calcium ammonium nitrate) or cattle waste (371 kg N*ha(-1) as urine) represent significant sources of nitrous oxide (7,2-15,7 kg N2O-N*ha(-1*)a(-1)). Mowing and moderate N fertilization rates (two cuts and rates up to 120 kg N*ha(-1)) caused only a weak increase in nitrous oxide emission (1,2-5,4 kg N2O-N*ha(-1*a)a(-1)), Reflooding led to an additional strong reduction of nitrous oxide fluxes (0,1-0,8 kg N2O-N*ha(-1*)a(-1)). The considerable temporal and spatial variability of flux rates was obviously induced by complex interactions of many factors and processes like water table, management systems, weather (especially by frost periods), soil degradation, plant growth, C/N transformation, and matter output on the emission rates in fens. However, the disturbed fens represent a significant source of nitrous oxide in Germany. Fens only occupy approx. 5,4 % of Germans total agricultural area, but their overall flux rate of 6574 t N2O-N*a(-1) has a share of approx. 12,4 % in the total nitrous oxide emission from German agriculture.

AB Black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.) occurs naturally in temperate marshes and in minerotrophic peatlands and is also suitable for paludiculture - the cultivation of biomass on wet or rewetted peatland. We investigated the effect of a newly established black alder plantation on the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of a degraded fen in north-eastern Germany over a two-year period (August 2010-August 2012). We compared the alder plantation (A(wet)) with an extensively used meadow (M-wet) and a drier reference meadow (M-moist). GHG fluxes were measured monthly to bi-monthly using the closed chamber method. Our results show that A(wet) was a slight net GHG (in CO2-eq) sink of -3.4 +/- 1.7 t ha(-1) yr(-1), M-wet was a moderate net GHG source of 9.6 +/- 1.2 t ha(-1) yr(-1), and M-wet was a strong net GHG source of 24.5 +/- 1.6 t ha(-1) yr(-1). This was mainly driven by CO2 uptake at the two very moist (wet) sites and by high CO2 release at the drier reference site. A(wet) was a larger CO2 sink than M-wet, probably due to additional CO2 uptake by the alder stand at A(wet) and carbon export in plant material harvested from A(wet). All sites were significant CH4 sources. Substantial CH4 emission peaks were observed at all sites following extraordinarily heavy precipitation during the summer of 2011, which accounted for up to 70 % of the accumulated two-year CH4 emissions. However, the A(wet) site generally emitted less CH4, possibly due to the effective oxygen transport mechanism in black alders. N2O emissions were negligible at all three sites. Our results indicate that the GHG balances of formerly drained fens benefit in the short term from planting of black alders, mostly due to reduced CH4 emissions. This study highlights the importance of acknowledging extreme precipitation events and groundwater fluctuations for the derivation of reliable GHG emission factors.

AB Drained peatlands are significant sources of the greenhouse gas (GHG) carbon dioxide. Rewetting is a proven strategy used to protect carbon stocks; however, it can lead to increased emissions of the potent GHG methane. The response to rewetting of soil microbiomes as drivers of these processes is poorly understood, as are the biotic and abiotic factors that control community composition. We analyzed the pro- and eukaryotic microbiomes of three contrasting pairs of minerotrophic fens subject to decade-long drainage and subsequent long-term rewetting. Abiotic soil properties including moisture, dissolved organic matter, methane fluxes, and ecosystem respiration rates were also determined. The composition of the microbiomes was fen-type-specific, but all rewetted sites showed higher abundances of anaerobic taxa compared to drained sites. Based on multi-variate statistics and network analyses, we identified soil moisture as a major driver of community composition. Furthermore, salinity drove the separation between coastal and freshwater fen communities. Methanogens were more than 10-fold more abundant in rewetted than in drained sites, while their abundance was lowest in the coastal fen, likely due to competition with sulfate reducers.

SO LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY

ID LONG-TERM; PEAT
AB Context Globally, the intensive use of peatlands contributes substantially to greenhouse gas emissions. The intensification of peatland use has led to increasing carbon (C) losses over the last centuries, but without historical emissions data, these increases and cumulative emissions are difficult to quantify. Objectives To understand the magnitude and development of soil C losses through peatland drainage in Switzerland through time, and to relate the situation of peatlands today to this historical development. Methods Historical records and a published estimate of the peatland extent are used to estimate peatlands' original extent and C stocks, and to understand trends in the historical use of peatlands. Land use-specific emission factors are applied to estimate the C emission through drainage over the last 300 years. Results Ca. 15 to 55 Mt C have been lost through peatland drainage in Switzerland. Despite a decrease in the area of organic soils, annual C emissions have increased considerably especially since the mid-twentieth century due to intensification of their use, particularly for agriculture. This C loss is a magnitude greater than that lost through extracted peat. Remaining C stocks approximate those lost over the last 300 years. Conclusions The rate of peatland surface loss in Switzerland is typical of European wetlands. Uncertainties in emission factors remain high and should be refined to justify any mitigation strategies. Although peat is no longer mined in Switzerland, future C emissions from peatlands will remain high as long as the effects of drainage networks and their current intensity of use persist.

AB Permafrost peatlands are biogeochemical hot spots in the Arctic as they store vast amounts of carbon. Permafrost thaw could release part of these long-term immobile carbon stocks as the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, but how much, at which time-span and as which gaseous carbon species is still highly uncertain. Here we assess the effect of permafrost thaw on GHG dynamics under different moisture and vegetation scenarios in a permafrost peatland. A novel experimental approach using intact plant-soil systems (mesocosms) allowed us to simulate permafrost thaw under near-natural conditions. We monitored GHG flux dynamics via high-resolution flow-through gas measurements, combined with detailed monitoring of soil GHG concentration dynamics, yielding insights into GHG production and consumption potential of individual soil layers. Thawing the upper 10-15 cm of permafrost under dry conditions increased CO2 emissions to the atmosphere (without vegetation: 0.74 +/- 0.49 vs. 0.84 +/- 0.60 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1); with vegetation: 1.20 +/- 0.50 vs. 1.32 +/- 0.60 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1), mean +/- SD, pre- and post-thaw, respectively). Radiocarbon dating (C-14) of respired CO2, supported by an independent curve-fitting approach, showed a clear contribution (9%-27%) of old carbon to this enhanced post-thaw CO2 flux. Elevated concentrations of CO2, CH4, and dissolved organic carbon at depth indicated not just pulse emissions during the thawing process, but sustained decomposition and GHG production from thawed permafrost. Oxidation of CH4 in the peat column, however, prevented CH4 release to the atmosphere. Importantly, we show here that, under dry conditions, peatlands strengthen the permafrost-carbon feedback by adding to the atmospheric CO2 burden post-thaw. However, as long as the water table remains low, our results reveal a strong CH4 sink capacity in these types of Arctic ecosystems pre- and post-thaw, with the potential to compensate part of the permafrost CO2 losses over longer timescales.

AB As soon as peat soil is drained for agricultural production, the peat starts to degrade, which causes emissions to the atmosphere. In countries with large peatland areas, the GHG mitigation potential related to management of these soils is often estimated as the highest amongst the measures available in agriculture. Although the facts are well known, the policies leading to diminished emissions are often difficult to implement. We have analysed the reasons why the mitigation potential is not fully utilized and what could be done better in national implementation of climate policies. Four cases are used to illustrate the necessary steps to reach mitigation targets: determining the amount and properties of peat soils, estimating the potential, costs and feasibility of the mitigation measures, and selecting and implementing the best measures. A common feature for all of the cases was that national and international climate policies have increased the public interest in GHG emissions from peat soils and increased the pressure for mitigation. Basically the same factors restrict the implementation of mitigation measures in all countries with significant peat soil areas. The most important of these is lack of policy coherence, e.g. ignoring climate policies when planning land use or agricultural policies. We conclude that GHG mitigation is achieved only if other policies, especially national regulations and strategies, are in line with climate policies.
   Policy relevance
   Agricultural peat soils could be used to help reach GHG mitigation goals in many countries, but the full potential of mitigation of peat soils is not used. Although peatland cultivation inevitably leads to loss of the whole peat layer and high emissions, there are few incentives or regulation to effectively minimize these losses. This article discusses the possibilities to reduce GHG emissions from agricultural peat soils, with specific emphasis on the barriers of implementing mitigation measures nationally. The lessons learned from the selected cases emphasize the role of all policy makers and their cooperation in planning coherent policies for achieving the goals determined by climate policies.

AB Temporal variations in methane (CH4) exchange between the soil and the atmosphere during a period of 3 years after a forest fire were estimated by combining field measurements of CH4 flux with an analysis of satellite images. The study area was located in a boreal peat swamp forest in the West Siberian plain that experienced a severe fire in the summer of 1998. The surface of the burned area was classified into bare soil, open water and recovered vegetation. In the summers of 1999 and 2000, CH4 fluxes, using a closed-chamber method, and environmental variables, such as soil temperature and soil water content, for each of the three surface types in the burned area and in the unburned area were measured. In general, CH4 fluxes were controlled by the surface moisture in the burned area and by the temperature in the unburned forest. Temporal changes in the areal coverage of soil, water and vegetation in the burned area were investigated using NOAA AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data with subpixel land-cover characterization. Based on the satellite information, temporal changes in the moisture conditions of the burned surface were estimated and temporal variations in the CH4 fluxes for the entire burned area were calculated. The cumulative CH4 emission rates from the entire burned area during the summer (from June to August) were estimated to range from 0.39 to 0.48 g C m(-2) during the period from 1999 to 2001. In contrast, unburned forest soils were consistently net CH4 consumers. The cumulative consumption rate during the summer was calculated to be approximately 0.4 g C m(-2) based on a reanalysis air temperature dataset. As the surface soil had become extremely wet since the fire, the soil had become a net emitter of CH4 after the fire disturbance, although CH4 oxidation predominated in the unburned forest.

AB Natural peatlands are the world's most area-effective carbon sinks. However, over 90% of German, 40% of European and 10-20% of global peatlands have been degraded and converted into carbon sources, primarily because of agricultural drainage. Against this background, rewetting and more sensible uses of peat soils for agriculture are internationally recognized as effective potential options to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper presents estimates of the GHG mitigation potential and abatement costs of different peatland management options by using the example of farm models that represent typical farm types in an intensive grassland-use peatland region in southern Germany. Therefore, an optimization model at the farm level that includes the emissions from all relevant sources in the production process is used.
   The current net GHG emissions of the farm models range from 10 to 12.9 tCO(2)e ha(-1) a(-1), of which the peat soil borne emissions make up a noticeable share. The rewetting and conversion of medium-drained grassland into wet grassland lead to considerable reductions of GHG emissions. However, in intensively managed dairy farms, the full emission Mitigation potential of these peatland management options is not realized, because necessary adaptations increase emissions from other sources. Because of its low GHG mitigation potential, the conversion of arable land into medium drained intensive grassland leads to high abatement costs of up to 92(sic)/tCO(2)e, while the abatement costs of the rewetting and conversion into wet grassland range from 5 to 57(sic)/tCO(2)e. The results vary by farm type, intensity of agricultural peatland use to date and the share of peatland area on a farm. This stresses the need for individual farm approaches and impact analyses for planned peatland renaturations. The findings also show that the overall costs to compensate farmer income loss from planned peatland renaturations will be as high as they are for more intensively managed dairy farms, which will be located in and affected in the respective area. The modelling approach presented has the potential to be adapted to the needs of peatland farm systems in other countries of the temperate zone. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Climate warming is predicted to increase heterotrophic metabolism in northern peatland soils leading to enhanced greenhouse gas emissions. However, the specific relationships between temperature and the greenhouse gas producing microbial communities are poorly understood. Thus, in this study, the temperature dependence of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) production rates along with abundance and composition of microbial communities were investigated in peat from a Sphagnum-dominated peatland, S1 bog (Minnesota, United States). Whereas CH4 production rates increased with temperature up to 30 degrees C, CO2 production did not, resulting in a lower CO2:CH4 ratio with increasing temperature. CO2 production showed both psychrophilic and mesophilic maxima at 4 and 20 degrees C, respectively, and appears to be mediated by two anaerobic microbial communities, one that operates under psychrophilic conditions that predominate for much of the year, and another that is more active under warmer conditions during the growing season. In incubations at 10 degrees C above the ambient range, members of the Clostridiaceae and hydrogenotrophic methanogens of the Methanobacteriaceae dominated. Moreover, a significant negative correlation between temperature and microbial diversity was observed. Results indicate that the potential consequences of warming surface peat in northern peatlands include a large stimulation in CH4 production and a significant loss of microbial diversity.

AB Abandoned peat extraction areas are continuous emitters of GHGs; hence, abandonment of peat extraction areas should immediately be followed by conversion to an appropriate after-use. Our primary aim was to clarify the atmospheric impact of reed canary grass (RCG, Phalaris arundinacea L.) cultivation on an abandoned peat extraction area and to compare it to other after-treatment alternatives. We performed a life-cycle assessment for five different after-use options for a drained organic soil withdrawn from peat extraction: (I) bare peat soil (no management), (II) non-fertilised Phalaris cultivation, (III) fertilised Phalaris cultivation, (IV) afforestation, and (V) rewetting. Our results showed that on average the non-fertilised and fertilised Phalaris alternatives had a cooling effect on the atmosphere (-10,837 and -477 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1), respectively), whereas afforestation, rewetting, and no-management alternatives contributed to global warming (9,511, 8,195, and 2,529 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1), respectively). The main components influencing the global warming potential of different after-use alternatives were site GHG emissions, carbon assimilation by plants, and emissions from combustion, while management-related emissions played a relatively minor role. The results of this study indicate that, from the perspective of atmospheric impact, the most suitable after-use option for an abandoned peat extraction area is cultivation of RCG.

AB Peatland landscapes typically exhibit large variations in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to microtopographic and vegetation heterogeneity. As many peatland budgets are extrapolated from small-scale chamber measurements it is important to both quantify and understand the processes underlying this spatial variability. Here we carried out a mesocosm study which allowed a comparison to be made between different microtopographic features and vegetation communities, in response to conditions of both static and changing water table. Three mesocosm types (hummocks + Juncus effusus, hummocks + Eriophorum vaginatum, and hollows dominated by moss) were subjected to two water table treatments (0-5 cm and 30-35 cm depth). Measurements were made of soil-atmosphere GHG exchange, GHG concentration within the peat profile and soil water solute concentrations. After 14 weeks the high water table group was drained and the low water table group flooded. Measurement intensity was then increased to examine the immediate response to change in water table position. Mean CO2, CH4 and N2O exchange across all chambers was 39.8 mu g m(-2) s(-1), 54.7 mu g m(-2) h(-1) and -2.9 mu g m(-2) h(-1), respectively. Hence the GHG budget was dominated in this case by CO2 exchange. CO2 and N2O emissions were highest in the low water table treatment group; CH4 emissions were highest in the saturated mesocosms. We observed a strong interaction between mesocosm type and water table for CH4 emissions. In contrast to many previous studies, we found that the presence of aerenchyma-containing vegetation reduced CH4 emissions. A significant pulse in both CH4 and N2O emissions occurred within 1-2 days of switching the water table treatments. This pulsing could potentially lead to significant underestimation of landscape annual GHG budgets when widely spaced chamber measurements are upscaled.

AB Flux gradient, eddy covariance and relaxed eddy accumulation methods were applied to measure CH4 and N2O emissions from peatlands and arable land respectively. Measurements of N2O emission by eddy covariance using tunable diode laser spectroscopy provided fluxes ranging from 2 to 60 mu mol N2O m(-2) h(-1) with a mean value of 22 mu mol N2O m(-2) h(-1) from 320 h of continuous measurements.
   Fluxes of CH4 measured above peatland in Caithness (U.K.) during May and June 1993 by eddy covariance and relaxed eddy accumulation methods were in the range 70 to 120 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1) with means of 14.7 mu.mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and 22.7 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1) respectively.
   Emissions of CH4 from peatland changed with mater table depth and soil temperature; increasing from 25 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1) at 5% pool area to 50 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1) with 30% within the flux footprint occupied by pools. A temperature response of 4.9 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1) degrees C-1 in the range 6-12 degrees C was also observed.
   The close similarity in average CH4 emission fluxes reported for wetlands in Caithness, Hudson Bay and Alaska in the range 11 to 40 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1) suggests that earlier estimates of CH4 emission from high latitude wetlands were too large or that the area of high latitudes contributing to CH4 emission has been seriously underestimated.

AB Peatlands play an essential role in carbon cycling and global warming. However, the feedback of peatlands to global changes is still unclear. Here, we conducted a data synthesis of 236 observations from 52 field experiments to evaluate the effect of three important global changes (warming, nitrogen addition, and vegetation composition change) on three major greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes: CO2, CH4, and N2O. The results showed that (i) GHG responses to warming varied among warming methods, between air temperature increase rates, and between warming durations; (ii) GHG responses to N addition varied between peatland types, between N forms, between N concentrations, and between experimental durations; (iii) the response rates of GHGs were associated with local environmental parameters (mean annual precipitation, MAP; and water table level, WTL); (iv) the global warming potential (GWP) considerably increased under these global changes, which indicates that cooling function of peatlands will be weakened. Overall, given these global changes occur simultaneously, the interaction of them on GHG fluxes should not be ignored. Our results highlight that a large number of studies in different locations are needed to comprehensively understand and accurately predict GHG emissions from peatlands.

AB Studies on greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted by hydroelectric reservoirs have shown until now that the fate of carbon, following impoundment, seems to reach the fate of carbon in natural aquatic ecosystems after a decade or so. To adequately assess this assumption and then obtain the net GHG emissions from the Eastmain-1 hydroelectric reservoir, the carbon stock and GHG emissions from peatlands and different succession stages of forested areas need to be characterized prior to the reservoir impoundment. It is therefore important to characterize the carbon flow process (surface fluxes and sequestrated carbon) from these terrestrial systems prior to impoundment. The Canadian Wildlife Service of Environment Canada, Quebec region, has developed an approach for mapping wetlands using Landsat/RADARSAT-1 satellite images. The method is based on image segmentation using the Definiens Professional software. The top-down object-based classification is based on the Canadian Wetland Classification System and quickly and precisely identifies ecologically meaningful wetland polygons. The main objective of this study is to produce a wetland map of the Eastmain River watershed using a SPOT-4 image aimed at identifying five classes of wetlands (bog, fen, marsh, swamp, shallow water) for a geographical unit of at least 1 ha, and to add to the peatland classes a description of their components, such as pool complexes and vegetation structures, to assign measured carbon values to these different peatland classes and scale up the data to obtain a regional carbon budget. The second objective of the study consists in determining whether SPOT-4 images can be used to map wetlands, using the object-based method developed with Landsat/RADARSAT-1 images, and if a finer spatial resolution would improve the wetland mapping results by adding information on wetland components. The SPOT-4 classification using the object-based method allowed the five main wetland classes to be identified in addition to pool complexes in three density classes (isolated, low density, and high density) and "bogs"/"fens" vegetation structure (treed or open) in peatland classes. Validation was done at two levels: (i) between the five classes of wetlands, and (ii) between pool complexes and vegetation structures. The overall accuracy was 81% for the first level and 75% for the second.

AB Drained peatlands are important sources of greenhouse gases and are rewetted to curb these emissions. We study one drained and one rewetted fen in terms of losses-and, after rewetting-gains of organic matter (OM), carbon (C), and peat thickness. We determined bulk density (BD) and ash/OM (and C/OM) ratios for 0.5 cm thick contiguous slices from peat monoliths to calculate losses. Whereas one site has lost 28.5 kg OM m(-2) corresponding to annual emissions of similar to 10 t CO2 ha(-1) a(-1) over 50 years of effective drainage, the other site has lost 102 kg OM m(-2), corresponding to an annual loss of similar to 30 t CO2 ha(-1) a(-1) for 30 years of intensive drainage and 6 t CO2 ha(-1) a(-1) during similar to 225 years of weak drainage before that. Height losses ranged from 43 to 162 cm. In the 20 years after rewetting, 2.12 kg C m(-2) was accumulated, equaling an average annual uptake of similar to 0.4 kg CO2 m(-2) a(-1). The results indicate that rewetting can lead to carbon accumulation in fens. This sink function is only small compared with the high emissions that are avoided through rewetting.

AB We document a two-year experimental trial of a recently-developed integrated peat-harvesting and reclamation technique at a poor fen in northern Ontario, Canada. We removed and conserved the uppermost similar to 0.3 m of peat in blocks while deeper peat was harvested from the resultant pit. We allowed the extraction pit to flood with shallow groundwater, and then reclaimed the conserved surficial peat blocks by transplanting them into the flooded pit where they formed a low, floating mat. In the 2nd year after harvest average Sphagnum cover in our experimental plot was intermediate (similar to 25 %) between hummocks (similar to 100 %) and hollows (similar to 10 %) at an adjacent unharvested reference plot. Mean rates of Sphagnum productivity were greater in the experimental plot (65-86 g m(-2) month(-1)) than in the reference plot (45-55 g m(-2) month(-1)) for both hummock (S. fuscum) and lawn (S. magellanicum) species, although not significantly so, indicating that the transplant had no adverse effects on Sphagnum health. The inundated soil conditions in the trial pit prevented the large carbon dioxide emissions that are characteristic of many harvested peatlands. During the second growing season midday net ecosystem exchange at the experimental plot was similar to that at hollows in the reference plot. However, the anoxic soil conditions in the experimental plot led to highly elevated methane emissions in both years. Our results demonstrate that the method can enable rapid re-establishment of a healthy Sphagnum mat and carbon dioxide sequestration function in harvested peatlands, although the global warming potential of our experimental trial was high due to elevated methane emissions.

AB Many peatlands have been drained and harvested for peat mining, agriculture, and other purposes, which has turned them from carbon (C) sinks into C emitters. Rewetting of disturbed peatlands facilitates their ecological recovery and may help them revert to carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks. However, rewetting may also cause substantial emissions of the more potent greenhouse gas (GHG) methane (CH4). Our knowledge of the exchange of CO2 and CH4 following rewetting during restoration of disturbed peatlands is currently limited. This study quantifies annual fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in a disturbed and rewetted area located in the Burns Bog Ecological Conservancy Area in Delta, BC, Canada. Burns Bog is recognized as the largest raised bog ecosystem on North America's west coast. Burns Bog was substantially reduced in size and degraded by peat mining and agriculture. Since 2005, the bog has been declared a conservancy area, with restoration efforts focusing on rewetting disturbed ecosystems to recover Sphagnum and suppress fires. Using the eddy covariance (EC) technique, we measured year-round (16 June 2015 to 15 June 2016) turbulent fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from a tower platform in an area rewetted for the last 8 years. The study area, dominated by sedges and Sphagnum, experienced a varying water table position that ranged between 7.7 (inundation) and -26.5 cm from the surface during the study year. The annual CO2 budget of the rewetted area was -179 +/- 26.2 gCO(2)-Cm-2 yr(-1) (CO2 sink) and the annual CH4 budget was 17 +/- 1.0 gCH(4-)Cm(-2) yr(-1) (CH4 source). Gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) exceeded ecosystem respiration (R-e) during summer months (June-August), causing a net CO2 uptake. In summer, high CH4 emissions (121 mgCH(4)-Cm-2 day(-1)) were measured. In winter (December-February), while roughly equal magnitudes of GEP and R-e made the study area CO2 neutral, very low CH4 emissions (9 mgCH(4)-Cm-2 day(-1)) were observed. The key environmental factors controlling the seasonality of these exchanges were downwelling photosynthetically active radiation and 5 cm soil temperature. It appears that the high water table caused by ditch blocking suppressed R-e. With low temperatures in winter, CH4 emissions were more suppressed than R-e. Annual net GHG flux from CO2 and CH4 expressed in terms of CO2 equivalents (CO2 eq.) during the study period totalled -22 +/- 103.1 gCO(2) eq. m(-2) y(-1) (net CO2 eq. sink) and 1248 +/- 147.6 gCO(2) eq. m(-2) yr(-1) (net CO2 eq. source) by using 100- and 20-year global warming potential values, respectively. Consequently, the ecosystem was almost CO2 eq. neutral during the study period expressed on a 100-year time horizon but was a significant CO2 eq. source on a 20-year time horizon.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions from managed peatlands are annually reported to the UNFCCC For the estimation of greenhouse gas (GHG) balances on a country-wide basis, It is necessary to know how soil-atmosphere fluxes are associated with variables that are available for spatial upscaling We measured momentary soil-atmosphere CO2 (heterotrophic and total soil respiration), CH4 and N2O fluxes at 68 forestry-drained peatland sites in Finland over two growing seasons We estimated annual CO2 effluxes for the sites using site-specific temperature regressions and simulations in half-hourly time steps Annual CH4 and N2O fluxes were interpolated from the measurements We then tested how well climate and site variables derived from forest inventory results and weather statistics could be used to explain between-site variation in the annual fluxes The estimated annual CO2 effluxes ranged from 1165 to 4437 g m(-2) year(-1) (total soil respiration) and from 534 to 2455 g m(-2) year(-1) (heterotrophic soil respiration) Means of 95% confidence intervals were +/- 12% of total and +/- 22% of heterotrophic soil respiration Estimated annual CO2 efflux was strongly correlated with soil respiration at the reference temperature (10 degrees C) and with summer mean air temperature. Temperature sensitivity had little effect on the estimated annual fluxes Models with tree stand stem volume, site type and summer mean air temperature as independent variables explained 56% of total and 57% of heterotrophic annual CO2 effluxes. Adding summer mean water table depth to the models raised the explanatory power to 66% and 64% respectively Most of the sites were small CH4 sinks and N2O sources The interpolated annual CH4 flux (range -0 97 to 12 50 g m(-2) year(-1)) was best explained by summer mean water table depth (r(2) = 64%) and rather weakly by tree stand stern volume (r(2) = 22%) and mire vegetation cover (r(2) = 15%) N2O flux (range. -0 03 to 092 g m(-2) year(-1)) was best explained by peat CN ratio (r(2) = 35%). Site type explained 13% of annual N2O flux We suggest that water table depth should be measured in national land-use inventories for improving the estimation of country-level GHG fluxes for peatlands (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB The increase in nitrogen (N) deposition may affect nitrous oxide (N2O) emission in boreal peatlands by increasing N availability and/or altering vegetation composition. However, the effects of changes in vegetation composition (due to the increase in N deposition) on N2O emission are still unknown. Therefore, we used a factorial design, comprising the removal of plant functional groups and N fertilization to investigate their independent effects and combined effects on N2O fluxes at an ombrotrophic blanket bog in Western Newfoundland, Canada. The results reveal that N2O emission significantly increased with N fertilization. Notably, the effect of N addition on N2O fluxes was modulated by the removal of graminoids. In particular, the removal of graminoids reduced 69% of the N2O emission increases due to N fertilization in the third year of the experiment. This result suggests that the enhancement of graminoid abundance due to increases in N deposition/fertilization may dramatically increase N2O emissions in boreal peatlands leading to stronger impacts on the global climate and stratospheric ozone depletion in the future if no countermeasures to reduce reactive N emission are undertaken.

AB Fen peatlands represent a globally important carbon (C) store, while also providing highly productive agricultural land. Drainage of these organic soils is required to create conditions suitable for crop growth, but this results in substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. One potential GHG mitigation option is to raise the groundwater table to reduce the duration and volume of peat exposure to aerobic conditions. However, the trade-off between maintaining food production and securing ecosystem function under a high water table (WT) presents a serious challenge for both land managers and policy makers. Therefore, we conducted a controlled mesocosm experiment to investigate the effects of WT elevation (from similar to 50 cm to similar to 30 cm) under three contrasting scenarios: (i) WT raised throughout the year, (ii) WT raised in the winter only, and (iii) WT raised in the growing season only. We measured GHG emissions, nitrate, ammonium and dissolved organic C concentrations in soil solution, alongside the yield of a commercially important crop (lettuce). Raising the WT throughout the year reduced lettuce yields by 37% and reduced CO2 emissions by 36% without changing the loss rates of N2O or CH4. Raising the WT only in the winter did not significantly reduce crop yield, but still suppressed CO2 emissions during the fallow period (by 30%). Raising the WT only in the growing season reduced root growth and CO2 emissions (by 27%), but had no major effect on lettuce yield. In conclusion, the present study shows that raising the groundwater table in the non-growing season reduced GHG emissions without negatively affecting lettuce yields, and may therefore represent a viable GHG mitigation option for agricultural peatlands.

AB Peat lands are the most efficient carbon stores of all terrestrial ecosystems, containing approximately 455 Pg of carbon, which is twice the amount found in the world's forest biomass. The majority of this carbon is stored in the saturated peat soil. Pristine peatlands are still sequestering carbon at a rate of 0.096 Pg carbon per year; however, anthropogenic degradation of peatlands through draining, fires and exploitation can increase the production of GHGs, switching peatlands from net sinks to net sources of carbon. Conservation of peatlands throughout the UK and the rest of the world is clearly essential for limiting GHG emissions and it is therefore surprising that accounting for emissions from peatlands does not feature prominently in the UNFCCC's Kyoto Protocol. Discussions at Conference of the Parties (COP) COP-15 and COP-16 look set to make amends for this oversight in any post-2012 climate change legislation, with peatlands becoming important factors in national GHG inventories, the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector, and in the creation of internationally accredited carbon credits. Using figures from The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB), the world's peatlands can be valued at up to US$18 billion. However, this sum does not take into account pending UNFCCC decisions. The detailed mandatory inclusion of peatlands in national GHG inventory schemes and in accredited carbon markets could see their value rise even further. This review looks at the current GHG emission-monitoring legislation regarding peatlands, with special focus given to those in the UK. It discusses the importance of peatlands in carbon sequestration, reviews how peatlands feature in current GHG emission-monitoring schemes, concentrating on those associated with the Kyoto Protocol, and considers how peatlands may feature in national GHG emission-monitoring schemes and carbon markets in the future.

Non-growing season carbon fluxes significantly contribute to annual carbon budgets in peatlands, yet their response to climate change is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the governing environmental variables of non-growing season carbon emissions in a northern peatland. We develop a support-vector regression model using a continuous 13-year dataset of eddy covariance flux measurements from the Mer Blue Bog, Canada. We determine that only seven variables were needed to reproduce carbon fluxes, which were most sensitive to net radiation above the canopy, soil temperature, wind speed and soil moisture. We find that changes in soil temperature and photosynthesis drove changes in net carbon flux. Assessing net ecosystem carbon exchange under three representative concentration pathways, we project a 103% increase in peatland carbon loss by 2100 under a high emissions scenario. We suggest that peatland carbon losses constitute a strong positive climate feedback loop.
   Future changes in non-growing season conditions, particularly irradiance and temperature, will enhance carbon emissions from a northern peatland, according to projections with a data-driven machine learning model.

AB The agricultural use of drained peatlands leads to huge emissions of greenhouse gases and nutrients. A land-use alternative that allows rewetting of drained peatland while maintaining agricultural production is the cultivation of Sphagnum biomass as a renewable substitute for fossil peat in horticultural growing media (Sphagnum farming).
   We studied Sphagnum productivity and nutrient dynamics during two years in two Sphagnum farming sites in NW Germany, which were established on drained bog grassland by sod removal, rewetting, and the introduction of Sphagnum fragments in 2011 and 2016, respectively.
   We found a considerable and homogeneous production of Sphagnum biomass (>3.6 ton DW ha(-1) yr(-1)), attributable to the high nutrient levels, low alkalinity, and even distribution of the irrigation water. The ammonium legacy from former drainage-based agriculture rapidly declined after rewetting, while nutrient mobilization was negligible. CH4 concentrations in the rewetted soil quickly decreased to very low levels. The Sphagnum biomass sequestered high loads of nutrients (46.0 and 47.4 kg N, 3.9 and 4.9 kg P, and 9.8 and 16.1 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1) in the 7.5 y and 2.5 y old sites, respectively), preventing off-site eutrophication.
   We conclude that Sphagnum farming as an alternative for drainage-based peatland agriculture may contribute effectively to tackling environmental challenges such as local and regional downstream pollution and global climate change. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) release from peatlands are closely related to water management and soil degradation. However, peat degradation has not been explicitly accounted for when estimating national greenhouse gas inventories. Here, we assembled a comprehensive dataset covering European, Russian and Canadian peatlands and introduced soil bulk density (BD) as a proxy for peat degradation to estimate nitrous oxide (N2O) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release. The results show that physical and biogeochemical properties of peat are sensitive to soil degradation. The BD is superior to other parameters (C/N, pH) to estimate annual N2O emissions and DOC pore water concentrations. The more a peat soil is degraded, the higher the risk of air/water pollution in peaty landscapes. Even after rewetting, highly degraded soils may exhibit high N2O release rates. The estimated annual N2O-N emissions from European, Russian and Canadian degraded peatlands sum up to approximately 81.0 Gg. The derived BD-based functions can assist in computing global matter fluxes from peatlands.

AB Drainage and cultivation have turned peatlands from carbon (C) sinks into hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Raising the water table and planting of winter cover crops are potential strategies to help reduce peat oxidation and re-initiate net C accumulation during the non-cropping period. However, the effects of these practices as well as their interactions on GHG emissions remain unclear. Here, we carried out an outdoor mesocosm experiment to elucidate the effect of water table levels (-30 cm and -50 cm) and winter cover crop cultivation (vetch, rye, no plant) on carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes during the winter period (November-April). Soil-atmosphere GHG exchange, GHG concentrations within the peat profile and soil water solute concentrations were monitored. Our results showed that high water table significantly reduced ecosystem respiration, while it had no net effect on N2O and CH4 fluxes. Uptake of available N by the cover crop significantly reduced nitrate in soil solution, thereby lowering the potential for leaching and both direct and indirect N2O emissions. No interactive effects between water table levels and cover crops were detected for any of the measured GHG fluxes. Seasonal variations of GHG fluxes were positively correlated with soil air concentrations at -15 cm and -40 cm depths, which were further regulated by dissolved organic C, nitrate concentration, and anaerobic conditions in the soil. This study suggests that there is great potential to raise water table levels and introduce green cover crops to reduce GHG emissions. Further studies are needed to achieve a complete evaluation of these strategies outside of the growing season, which may provide a significant mitigation benefit in C-rich cultivated peatlands.

AB During the last decades, various renaturation programmes have been initialized to recover nutrient sink and ecological functions of peatlands by rewetting. Rewetting, however, often results in the formation of hotspots for methane (CH4) emissions and in temporal dieback of local vegetation. The present study aimed at quantifying changes of CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in a peatland currently under continuous rewetting conditions. Emissions where studied at a permanently flooded site and a non-flooded peat site with fluctuating water tables by using common closed chamber method. The permanently flooded site revealed extremely high CH4 emissions (up to 1195 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) which were positively correlated with temperature, nutrient content, dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen concentration of the peat soil water. In contrast, the non-flooded peat site, with lower and fluctuating water tables (WT), showed significantly lower CH4 emissions and an increasing trend of CH4 release associated with a generally increasing WT caused by the progressing rewetting process. Lower N2O emissions (< 24 A mu g N m(-2) d(-1)) were observed at the flooded site. By contrast, the non-flooded peat site with fluctuating WT showed significantly higher N2O emissions (up to 4178 A mu g N m(-2) d(-1)), in particular at high temperatures during summer time. The present results indicate that permanently flooded conditions during rewetting processes might cause higher CH4 emissions compared to fluctuating WT which in contrast might enhance N2O emissions. In total, however, no decreasing trend for CH4 emissions throughout the five-year renaturation period could be found. At least for N2O we observed a decreasing trend during rewetting.

AB In-situ oil extraction activities impact the vast mosaic of boreal wetlands and uplands. Peatland restoration in these regions aims at reestablishing crucial peatland functions, such as peat accumulation and carbon (C) sequestration. In order to assess the success of fen restoration, we evaluated the biogeochemical conditions, the seasonal carbon balances via carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and methane (CH4) emissions, and addressed the global warming potential following different restoration techniques at two restored in-situ oil sands well pads, during two consecutive growing seasons. Restoration work involved: 1) the partial or complete removal of introduced well pad construction materials, and spontaneous revegetation, or 2) the partial removal of foreign clay, in addition to reintroduction of typical fen plant species such as Larix laricina, Salix lutea and Carex aquatilis. Comparisons were done with regional reference ecosystems (REF) consisting of three peatlands: a wooded bog, a wooded rich fen and a wooded extreme-rich fen. While the average electric conductivity of restored sectors (946 mu S cm(-1)) was higher compared to REF (360 mu S cm(-1)), the pH was quite similar (pH 5.8 REF, pH 6 restored). Dissolved organic carbon concentration was lower in all restored sectors (5-11 mg L-1 restored sectors, 15-35 mg L-1 REF), presumably due to the still incomplete recovery of vegetation and lower organic matter content associated with remnant well pad material. Re-establishment of shrub and brown moss species improved significantly the C uptake. However, the active introduction of plant species was no crucial restoration step, in order to return species beneficial for C uptake. Restoration treatments that were leveled closest to the surrounding REF showed the most similar seasonal C balance to REF. In shallow open water areas resulting from the complete removal of all construction materials, we measured the highest methane emissions making these flooded sites net C sources to the atmosphere with elevated global warming potential. The partial removal of the well pad's mineral soil to near the water table level and the surface elevation of the surrounding ecosystem seems to be the most effective site management method to sequester carbon efficiently. However, further research is needed to evaluate the suitability of this restoration method for the recovery of biodiversity and possible impacts of residual foreign materials on fen ecosystems.

Still, such data are highly scarce for Central European wetlands. In this work, we present the results of two years (2013-2014) of continuous open-path EC measurements of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes at the wetlands of the Biebrza National Park in northeastern Poland - one of the biggest coherent lowland wetland area in Central Europe. The measurement site (53(circle)35'30.8"N, 22(circle)53'32.4"E) was located near the Kopytkowka river in a fen peatland, whose soils are slightly decomposed due to dehydration. The mean annual sum of CH4 release equaled 29 +/- 4g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in wetter year 2013 and 20 +/- 1g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in drier year 2014. The mean annual uptake of CO2 reached 980 +/- 150 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) and 560 +/- 130 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Both fluxes show a clear annual pattern with maximum CH4 release in June and July (at a level of 130 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) and maximum CO2 uptake in June (at a level of 4.2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). The considerable C-CO2 uptake in comparison to C-CH4 emissions suggests that the Biebrza river wetlands are a significant carbon sink, but the net contribution of the Biebrza mires to the climate forcing is unclear because of different metrics which can be used to specify the relative weights of CO2 and CH4.

AB To meet the challenge of proactive ecosystem-based climate mitigation and adaptation, new sources of funding are needed. Peatlands provide the most efficient global store of terrestrial carbon. Degraded peatlands, however, contribute disproportionally to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with approximately 25% of all CO2 emissions from the land use sector, while restoration can be cost-effective. Peatland restoration therefore provides a newopportunity for investing in ecosystem-based mitigation through the development of carbon markets. Set in the international policy and carbon market context, this paper demonstrates the necessary scientific evidence and policy frameworks needed to develop ecosystem service markets for peatland restoration. Using the UK and NE Germany as case studies, we outline the climate change mitigation potential of peatlands and how changes in GHG emissions after restoration may be measured. We report on market demand research in carbon market investments that provide sponsors with quantification and officially certified recognition of the climate and other co-benefits. Building on this, we develop the necessary requirements for developing regional carbon markets to fund peatland restoration. While this paper focuses on the UK and German context, it draws on international experience, and is likely to be directly applicable across peatlands in Europe and North America.

AB Peatlands provide habitats for many species and a variety of ecosystem services worldwide. In this study we used an integrated biophysical-economic modeling approach with multi-objective optimization to investigate how alternative land-use and land-management (LULM) options jointly affect economic returns from marketed (timber, energy peat, restoration costs) and non-marketed public goods (water quality, GHG emissions, biodiversity) in a typical landscape dominated by peatlands in northern Finland. We considered several LULM options including no action (the current state will continue), bioenergy wood harvesting, intensive forest management, restoration, and energy peat extraction with three after use options (no after use, reforestation, rewetting). Our study revealed strong tradeoffs between biodiversity and ecosystem services in drained peatlands. Optimal LULM depended strongly on the chosen objectives, i.e. whether marketed or non-marketed goods were preferred. For example, when the objective was carbon neutral land-use, the no action option was mostly chosen, while bioenergy wood harvesting was mostly chosen when the objective was to provide economic and environmental benefits at the same time. The strong tradeoff between biodiversity and ecosystem services indicates that compromises are unavoidable in order to obtain a multi-functional landscape which provides biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation and water protection in a cost-effective manner.

AB Certain general circulation models predict that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations will increase the frequency of summer drought in northern wetlands due to hotter, drier summers. There is currently much uncertainty as to how drought will affect emissions of the greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide, from wetlands. We have demonstrated that an eight centimetre drawdown of the water table in a gully mire does not significantly affect nitrous oxide emissions from this site. However, under a more extreme drought scenario carried out on peat monoliths, nitrous oxide emissions increased exponentially with a linear decrease in water table height. Drought caused a significant increase in nitrous oxide production below the water table but most of the total increase could be attributed to increased emissions above the water table. Results from an acetylene Mock experiment suggested that increased emissions were caused by increased nitrous oxide production from denitrification, rather than by increased production from nitrification. In the laboratory study, drought severity had no effect on peatwater nitrate concentrations below the water table, however, increasing drought severity decreased ammonium concentrations.

AB Hot spots of CH4 emissions are a typical feature of pristine peatlands at the microsite and landscape scale. To determine whether rewetting and lake construction in a cutaway peatland would result in the re-creation of hot spots, we first measured CH4 fluxes over a 2-year period with static chambers and estimated annual emissions. Second, to assess whether rewetting and lake creation would produce hot spots at the landscape level, we hypothesized a number of alternative land use scenarios for the peatland following the cessation of peat extraction. Using the results from this study and other studies from literature, we calculated the global warming potential (GWP) of each scenario and the respective contribution of CH4. The results showed that hot spots of CH4 fluxes were observed as a consequence of microsite-specific differences in water table (WT) position and plant productivity. CH4 fluxes were closely related to peat temperature at 10 cm depth and WT position. Annual emissions ranged from 4.3 to 38.8 g CH4 m-2 yr-1 in 2002 and 3.2 to 28.8 g CH4 m-2 yr-1 in 2003. The scenario results suggest that lake creation is likely to result in the re-creation of a hot spot at the landscape level. However, the transition from cutaway to wetland ecosystem may lead to a reduction in the GWP of the peatland.

AB [1] Peatlands represent large carbon (C) reservoirs that can act as a source or sink for greenhouse gases. The response of peatland gaseous C fluxes to global climate change and atmospheric sulfate deposition, however, remains uncertain. Methanogenesis is thought to be one of the most important anaerobic C mineralization pathways in peatlands, especially in regions where input of sulfate from acid deposition is low. However, sulfate reduction has been quantified rarely in freshwater wetlands. Here we report greater anaerobic C flow through sulfate reduction than through methanogenesis at all sites situated along a global atmospheric sulfur deposition gradient. Stoichiometric mass balance suggests that fermentation is a dominant anaerobic C mineralization pathway in unpolluted peatlands, while methanogenesis contributed minimally to total anaerobic carbon mineralization in these sites. Furthermore, global increases of atmospheric sulfur deposition minimize the impacts of climatic warming by simultaneously decreasing rates of methanogenesis while causing little change in rates of total anaerobic C mineralization in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands.

AB Pristine peatlands have generally low nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions but drainage and management practices enhance the microbial processes and associated N2O emissions. It is assumed that leaving peat soils from intensive management, such as agriculture, will decrease their N2O emissions. In this paper we report how the annual N2O emission rates will change when agricultural peat soil is either left abandoned or afforested and also N2O emissions from afforested peat extraction sites. In addition, we evaluated a biogeochemical model (DNDC) with a view to explaining GHG emissions from peat soils under different land uses. The abandoned agricultural peat soils had lower mean annual N2O emissions (5.5 +/- A 5.4 kg N ha(-1)) than the peat soils in active agricultural use in Finland. Surprisingly, N2O emissions from afforested organic agricultural soils (12.8 +/- A 9.4 kg N ha(-1)) were similar to those from organic agricultural soils in active use. These emissions were much higher than those from the forests on nutrient rich peat soils. Abandoned and afforested peat extraction sites emitted more N2O, (2.4 +/- A 2.1 kg N ha(-1)), than the areas under active peat extraction (0.7 +/- A 0.5 kg N ha(-1)). Emissions outside the growing season contributed significantly, 40% on an average, to the annual emissions. The DNDC model overestimated N2O emission rates during the growing season and indicated no emissions during winter. The differences in the N2O emission rates were not associated with the age of the land use change, vegetation characteristics, peat depth or peat bulk density. The highest N2O emissions occurred when the soil C:N ratio was below 20 with a significant variability within the measured C:N range (13-27). Low soil pH, high nitrate availability and water table depth (50-70 cm) were also associated with high N2O emissions. Mineral soil has been added to most of the soils studied here to improve the fertility and this may have an impact on the N2O emissions. We infer from the multi-site dataset presented in this paper that afforestation is not necessarily an efficient way to reduce N2O emissions from drained boreal organic fields.

AB Climatic impacts of energy-peat extraction are of increasing concern due to EU emissions trading requirements. A new excavation-drier peat extraction method has been developed to reduce the climatic impact and increase the efficiency of peat extraction. To quantify and compare the soil GHG fluxes of the excavation drier and the traditional milling methods, as well as the areas from which the energy peat is planned to be extracted in the future (extraction reserve area types), soil CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes were measured during 2006-2007 at three sites in Finland. Within each site, fluxes were measured from drained extraction reserve areas, extraction fields and stockpiles of both methods and additionally from the biomass driers of the excavation-drier method. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), described at a principal level in ISO Standards 14040:2006 and 14044:2006, was used to assess the long-term (100 years) climatic impact from peatland utilisation with respect to land use and energy production chains where utilisation of coal was replaced with peat. Coal was used as a reference since in many cases peat and coal can replace each other in same power plants. According to this study, the peat extraction method used was of lesser significance than the extraction reserve area type in regards to the climatic impact. However, the excavation-drier method seems to cause a slightly reduced climatic impact as compared with the prevailing milling method.

AB Under natural conditions, peatlands are generally nitrate-limited. However, recent concerns about an additional N input into peatlands by atmospheric N deposition have highlighted the risk of an increased denitrification activity and hence the likelihood of a rise of emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the turnover of added nitrate in a drained and a rewetted peatland using a [N-15]nitrate-bromide double-tracer method. The double-tracer method allows a separation between physical effects (dilution, dispersion and dislocation) and microbial and chemical nitrate transformation by comparing with the conservative Br- tracer. In the drained peat site, low NO3- consumption rates have been observed. In contrast, NO3- consumption at the rewetted peat site rises rapidly to about 100% within 4 days after tracer application. Concomitantly, the N-15 abundances of nitrite and ammonium in soil water increased and lead to the conclusion that, besides commonly known NO3- reduction to nitrite (i.e. denitrification), a dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium has simultaneously taken place. The present study reveals that increasing NO3- inputs into rewetted peatlands via atmospheric deposition results in a rapid NO3- consumption, which could lead to an increase in N2O emissions into the atmosphere.

AB One of the major concerns regarding climate change in high latitudes is the potential feedback from greenhouse gases (GHG) being released from thawing peat soils. In this paper we show how vegetational patterns and associated GHG fluxes in subarctic palsa (peat mounds with a permanently frozen core) mires can be linked to climate, based on field observations from fifteen palsa sites distributed in northern Fennoscandia. Fine resolution (100 m) land cover data are combined with projections of future climate for the 21st century in order to model the potential future distribution of palsa vegetation in northern Fennoscandia. Site scale climate-vegetational relationships for two vegetation types are described by a climate suitability index computed from the field observations. Our results indicate drastic changes in the palsa vegetational patterns over the coming decades with a 97 % reduction in dry hummock areas by 2041-2060 compared to the 1961-1990 areal coverage. The impact of these changes on the carbon balance is a decrease in the efflux of CO2 from 130 kilotonnes C y(-1) to a net uptake of 11 kilotonnes C y(-1) and a threefold increase in the efflux of CH4 from 6 to 18 kilotonnes C y(-1) over the same period and over the 5,520 km(2) area of palsa mires. The combined effect is equivalent to a slight decrease in CO2-C emissions, from 182 to 152 kilotonnes C y(-1). Main uncertainties involve the ability of the vegetation community to adapt to new conditions, and long-term changes in hydrology due to absence of ice and frost heaving.

AB Peatland streams have repeatedly been shown to be highly supersaturated in both CO2 and CH4 with respect to the atmosphere, and in combination with dissolved (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) represent a potentially important pathway for catchment greenhouse gas (GHG) and carbon (C) losses. The aim of this study was to create a complete C and GHG (CO2, CH4, N2O) budget for Auchencorth Moss, an ombrotrophic peatland in southern Scotland, by combining flux tower, static chamber and aquatic flux measurements from 2 consecutive years. The sink/source strength of the catchment in terms of both C and GHGs was compared to assess the relative importance of the aquatic pathway. During the study period (2007-2008) the catchment functioned as a net sink for GHGs (352 g CO2-Eq m-2 yr-1) and C (69.5 g C m-2 yr-1). The greatest flux in both the GHG and C budget was net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Terrestrial emissions of CH4 and N2O combined returned only 4% of CO2 equivalents captured by NEE to the atmosphere, whereas evasion of GHGs from the stream surface returned 12%. DOC represented a loss of 24% of NEE C uptake, which if processed and evaded downstream, outside of the catchment, may lead to a significant underestimation of the actual catchment-derived GHG losses. The budgets clearly show the importance of aquatic fluxes at Auchencorth Moss and highlight the need to consider both the C and GHG budgets simultaneously.

AB Measurements of nitrogen isotope ratios (delta N-15) along vertical porewater profiles are instrumental in localizing sources and sinks of nitrous oxide (N2O) in wetland ecosystems. We present the first N2O concentration and isotope data for porewaters of ombrotrophic, mountain-top bogs. Our two study sites, situated in the Czech Republic at elevations higher than 1000 m, have been affected by atmospheric N pollution for more than 100 years. In recent decades, the northeastern site KB received over 30 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) via atmospheric deposition, the southwestern site BS was 3 times less polluted. Both peat bogs were surrounded by defoliated, dead spruce stands. We hypothesized that elevated nitrate (NO3-) inputs in rain-fed bogs may cause sizeable N2O emissions. Porewater N2O concentrations in the studied ombrotrophic bogs were 400-800 times higher, compared to fens in nearby Bavaria (Germany). The highest N2O concentrations and the lowest delta N-15-N2O values were found at the bottom of the sampled porewater profiles, 40-60 cm below surface. Low delta N-15-N2O values resulted from a N isotope fractionation associated with denitrification. The site with the lower historical N pollution, BS, exhibited up to 7 times higher porewater N2O concentrations than KB, possibly due to a higher denitrification potential determined as abundance of nirK and nirS genes. Upcore, N2O abundance decreased and delta N-15 -N2O increased, indicating N2O reduction. Processes of N2O formation and consumption at different depths were integrated by measuring N2O fluxes across the peat - atmosphere interface. These fluxes were minute (<0.02 mu mol N2O m(-2) h(-1)). We even observed scavenging of air-borne N2O by the bog substrate. Nitrogen pollution of ombrotrophic bogs led to vigorous N cycling, manifested by extremely high peat porewater N2O concentrations. However, effective in-situ consumption of the produced N2O greatly reduced its warming potential. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We show that sediment respiration is one of the key factors contributing to the high CO2 supersaturation in and evasion from Finnish lakes, and evidently also over large areas in the boreal landscape, where the majority of the lakes are small and shallow. A subpopulation of 177 randomly selected lakes (< 100 km(2)) and 32 lakes with the highest total phosphorus (P-tot) concentrations in the Nordic Lake Survey (NLS) data base were sampled during four seasons and at four depths. Patterns of CO2 concentrations plotted against depth and time demonstrate strong CO2 accumulation in hypolimnetic waters during the stratification periods. The relationship between O-2 departure from the saturation and CO2 departure from the saturation was strong in the entire data set (r(2)=0.79, n=2 740, P < 0.0001). CO2 concentrations were positively associated with lake trophic state and the proportion of agricultural land in the catchment. In contrast, CO2 concentrations negatively correlated with the peatland percentage indicating that either input of easily degraded organic matter and/or nutrient load from agricultural land enhance degradation. The average lake-area-weighted annual CO2 evasion based on our 177 randomly selected lakes and all Finnish lakes > 100 km(2) (Rantakari & Kortelainen, 2005) was 42 g C m(-2) LA (lake area), approximately 20% of the average annual C accumulation in Finnish forest soils and tree biomass (covering 51% of the total area of Finland) in the 1990s. Extrapolating our estimate from Finland to all lakes of the boreal region suggests a total annual CO2 evasion of about 50 TgC, a value upto 40% of current estimates for lakes of the entire globe, emphasizing the role of small boreal lakes as conduits for transferring terrestrially fixed C into the atmosphere.

AB Organic soils in peatlands store a great proportion of the global soil carbon pool and can lose carbon via the atmosphere due to degradation. In Germany, most of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from organic soils are attributed to sites managed as grassland. Here, we investigated a land use gradient from near-natural wetland (NW) to an extensively managed (GE) to an intensively managed grassland site (GI), all formed in the same bog complex in northern Germany. Vertical depth profiles of delta C-13, delta N-15, ash content, C / N ratio and bulk density as well as radiocarbon ages were studied to identify peat degradation and to calculate carbon loss. At all sites, including the near-natural site, delta C-13 depth profiles indicate aerobic decomposition in the upper horizons. Depth profiles of delta N-15 differed significantly between sites with increasing delta N-15 values in the top soil layers paralleling an increase in land use intensity owing to differences in peat decomposition and fertilizer application. At both grassland sites, the ash content peaked within the first centimetres. In the near-natural site, ash contents were highest in 10-60 cm depth. The ash profiles, not only at the managed grassland sites, but also at the near-natural site indicate that all sites were influenced by anthropogenic activities either currently or in the past, most likely due to drainage. Based on the enrichment of ash content and changes in bulk density, we calculated the total carbon loss from the sites since the peatland was influenced by anthropogenic activities. Carbon loss at the sites increased in the following order: NW< GE< GI. Radiocarbon ages of peat in the topsoil of GE and GI were hundreds of years, indicating the loss of younger peat material. In contrast, peat in the first centimetres of the NW was only a few decades old, indicating recent peat growth. It is likely that the NW site accumulates carbon today but was perturbed by anthropogenic activities in the past. Together, all biogeochemical parameters indicate a degradation of peat due to (i) conversion to grassland with historical drainage and (ii) land use intensification.

AB The combustion of peat for energy generation accounts for approximately 4.1% of Ireland's overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with current levels of combustion resulting in the emission of 2.8 Mt of CO2 per annum. The aim of this research is to evaluate the life cycle environmental impacts of peat use for energy generation in Ireland, from peatland drainage and industrial extraction, to transportation, combustion, and subsequent after-use of the cutaway area, utilising Irish-specific emission factors. The environmental impacts considered are global warming potential, acidification potential, and eutrophication potential. In addition, the cumulative energy demand of the system is evaluated. Previous studies on the environmental impact of peat for energy in Ireland relied on default Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission factors (EFs). This research utilises Irish-specific EFs and input data to reduce uncertainty associated with the use of default IPCC EFs, and finds that using default IPCC EFs overestimates the global warming potential when compared to Irish-specific EFs by approximately 2%. The greatest contribution to each of the environmental impacts considered arises from emissions generated during peat combustion, which accounts for approximately 95% of each of the environmental impact categories considered. Other stages of the life-cycle, such as impacts emanating from the peat extraction area, fossil fuel usage in harvesting and transportation machinery, and after-use of the cutaway area have much smaller effects on overall results. The transformation of cutaway peatlands to different after-use alternatives has the potential to mitigate some of the effects of peatland degradation and peat combustion.

AB Northern peatlands are a major natural source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Permafrost conditions and spatial heterogeneity are two of the major challenges for estimating CH4 fluxes from the northern high latitudes. This study reports the development of a new model to upscale CH4 fluxes from plant communities to ecosystem scale in permafrost peatlands by integrating an existing biogeochemical model DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) with a permafrost model Northern Ecosystem Soil Temperature (NEST). A new ebullition module was developed to track the changes of bubble volumes in the soil profile based on the ideal gas law and Henry's law. The integrated model was tested against observations of CH4 fluxes measured by closed chambers and eddy covariance (EC) method in a polygonal permafrost area in the Lena River Delta, Russia. Results from the tests showed that the simulated soil temperature, summer thaw depths and CH4 fluxes were in agreement with the measurements at the five chamber observation sites; and the modeled area-weighted average CH4 fluxes were similar to the EC observations in seasonal patterns and annual totals although discrepancy existed in shorter time scales. This study indicates that the integrated model, NESTDNDC, is capable of upscaling CH4 fluxes from plant communities to larger spatial scales.

AB Background: Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle. They provide important ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and storage. Drainage disturbs peatland ecosystem services. Mapping drains is difficult and expensive and their spatial extent is, in many cases, unknown. An object based image analysis (OBIA) was performed on a very high resolution satellite image (Geoeye-1) to extract information about drain location and extent on a blanket peatland in Ireland. Two accuracy assessment methods: Error matrix and the completeness, correctness and quality (CCQ) were used to assess the extracted data across the peatland and at several sub sites. The cost of the OBIA method was compared with manual digitisation and field survey. The drain maps were also used to assess the costs relating to blocking drains vs. a business-as-usual scenario and estimating the impact of each on carbon fluxes at the study site.
   Results: The OBIA method performed well at almost all sites. Almost 500 km of drains were detected within the peatland. In the error matrix method, overall accuracy (OA) of detecting the drains was 94% and the kappa statistic was 0.66. The OA for all sub-areas, except one, was 95-97%. The CCQ was 85%, 85% and 71% respectively. The OBIA method was the most cost effective way to map peatland drains and was at least 55% cheaper than either field survey or manual digitisation, respectively. The extracted drain maps were used constrain the study area CO(2 )flux which was 19% smaller than the prescribed Peatland Code value for drained peatlands.
   Conclusions: The OBIA method used in this study showed that it is possible to accurately extract maps of fine scale peatland drains over large areas in a cost effective manner. The development of methods to map the spatial extent of drains is important as they play a critical role in peatland carbon dynamics. The objective of this study was to extract data on the spatial extent of drains on a blanket bog in the west of Ireland. The results show that information on drain extent and location can be extracted from high resolution imagery and mapped with a high degree of accuracy. Under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol Annex 1 parties can account for greenhouse gas emission by sources and removals by sinks resulting from "wetlands drainage and rewetting". The ability to map the spatial extent, density and location of peatlands drains means that Annex 1 parties can develop strategies for drain blocking to aid reduction of CO2 emissions, DOC runoff and water discoloration. This paper highlights some uncertainty around using one-size-fits-all emission factors for GHG in drained peatlands and re-wetting scenarios. However, the OBIA method is robust and accurate and could be used to assess the extent of drains in peatlands across the globe aiding the refinement of peatland carbon dynamics.

AB Drained agricultural peat soils are significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) but also small sinks for methane (CH4). Leaving these soils without any cultivation practice could be an option to mitigate GHG emissions. To test this hypothesis, we measured, over a three year period, net CO2 exchange and fluxes of CH4 for five agricultural peat soils that had been abandoned for 20-30 years. Annually, the sites were either small net sinks or sources of CO2 and CH4 (-7.8 to 530 g CO2-C m(-2) and -0.41 to 1.8 g CH4 m(-2)). Including N2O emissions from our previous study, the net (CH4 + CO2 + N2O) emissions as CO2 equivalents were lower than in cultivated peat soils and were lowest in the wet year. Therefore, high GHG emissions from these soils could be avoided if the water table is maintained close to the soil surface when photosynthesis is favoured over respiration.

AB Peatlands cover only 3% of the Earth's land surface but boreal and subarctic peatlands store about 15-30% of the world's soil carbon ( C) as peat. Despite their potential for large positive feedbacks to the climate system through sequestration and emission of greenhouse gases, peatlands are not explicitly included in global climate models and therefore in predictions of future climate change. In April 2007 a symposium was held in Wageningen, the Netherlands, to advance our understanding of peatland C cycling. This paper synthesizes the main findings of the symposium, focusing on (i) small-scale processes, (ii) C fluxes at the landscape scale, and (iii) peatlands in the context of climate change.
   The main drivers controlling most are related to some aspects of hydrology. Despite high spatial and annual variability in Net Ecosystem Exchange ( NEE), the differences in cumulative annual NEE are more a function of broad scale geographic location and physical setting than internal factors, suggesting the existence of strong feedbacks. In contrast, trace gas emissions seem mainly controlled by local factors.
   Key uncertainties remain concerning the existence of perturbation thresholds, the relative strengths of the CO2 and CH4 feedback, the links among peatland surface climate, hydrology, ecosystem structure and function, and trace gas biogeochemistry as well as the similarity of process rates across peatland types and climatic zones. Progress on these research areas can only be realized by stronger co-operation between disciplines that address different spatial and temporal scales.

AB The temporal and spatial variations in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission estimates in wetlands impede our ability to predict and upscale total emissions; thus, a scalar parameter is needed to predict GHG emissions. We investigated the importance of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the prediction of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in rewetted agricultural peatlands, positing that both CH4 and N2O production are explained by the quantity and turnover of SOC. Field CH4 and N2O fluxes, along with other edaphic and environmental variables, were monitored in rewetted peatlands with a range of SOC (6%, 11%, and 23%) that were recently converted from row crops to flooded rice cultivation to reverse soil subsidence. Nitrogen (N) fertilization reduced annual CH4 emission by 77.2% in the 6% C field, but this effect was not found in other fields. Annual N2O emissions were not affected by N fertilization and averaged 8.9, 5.2, and 1.9 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for the 6%, 11%, and 23% C fields, respectively. SOC was the dominant factor controlling both CH4 and N2O emissions. The annual emission for both CH4 and N2O was accurately described by a decaying power regression with increasing SOC contents (R-2>0.49). This relationship was also observed after splitting total annual emission of CH4 and N2O into growing and fallow seasons. Nitrogen fertilization and the seasonality in CH4 and N2O emissions did not change the relationships. The inverse correlation between SOC and CH4 and N2O emissions was likely caused by different chemical composition of SOC in various soils. Our results suggest that SOC can be a potential proxy to predict CH4 and N2O emissions in rewetted peatlands to better define GHG predictions of wetland restoration efforts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Rewetting can effectively reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from drained peatlands. Reliable emissions estimation approaches are needed for accounting of such reductions and for evaluating the potential in terms of carbon credits. Annual mean water level and vegetation are reliable and widely used proxies for emissions estimation. However, indications of water level based on plant species (e.g. Ellenberg Indicator Values) are qualitative with large variances, and there are insufficient high-quality flux measurement data to support the direct use of vegetation as a proxy for GHG fluxes. Here we combine vegetation and water level proxies to estimate emissions, by using bioindication of vegetation communities for water level together with the linear correlation between annual mean water level and GHG fluxes. This approach is demonstrated in the Drentsche Aa brook valley in The Netherlands, where peatlands were rewetted to restore rich fen vegetation. Biodiversity of the landscape was monitored by repeated vegetation mapping before and after rewetting, which enables the estimation of emissions reduction as a co-benefit. Mean annual water level values are assigned to mapped vegetation types using existing data on water level dynamics from measurements on corresponding plant communities. GHG emissions are estimated using linear regression models of gas fluxes against mean annual water levels. This approach provides spatially explicit and quantitative estimation of mean annual water levels and GHG fluxes. When combined with information on spatial patterns and variances, the resulting estimations can promote recognition of the carbon co-benefits of biodiversity restoration while facilitating more site-specific optimisation of management practices.

TI Carbon budget response of an agriculturally used fen to different soil
   moisture conditions
SO AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY

AB The agricultural use of peatlands usually requires drainage, thereby transforming these organic soils from a net carbon sink into a net source. The Seeland region of Switzerland is characterised by fens that have been intensively used for agriculture for 150 years. Our site is a degraded fen with a remaining peat layer of 60 cm that had been used as cropland until 2009. In connection to a nature protection project it has been managed as extensive permanent grassland since then. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was determined for two years (2015-2016). For this purpose, the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and CH4 fluxes were measured by eddy covariance, and the carbon removed by harvest was quantified. Our degraded fen site was found to be a net carbon source of 477 +/- 73g C m(-2) yr(-1) and 434 +/- 51 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Annual CH4 emissions were marginal in both years with 0.4 +/- 0.8 g CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1) (2015) and 0.7 +/- 0.7 g CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1) (2016). In contrast to NECB, the NEE was considerably higher in 2015 than in 2016 (308 +/- 71 g C m(-2) yr(-1) vs 117 +/- 39 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The year 2015 was characterised by partial flooding of the grassland, followed by a dry and hot summer leading to lower CO2 uptake due to reduced growth, which was reflected in lower harvest compared to 2016. Thus, the short-term plant-induced carbon fluxes were altered, whereas total soil carbon loss remained rather constant. This was verified by an intra site comparison between the flooded and non-flooded part in 2015. Our results indicate that the soil carbon loss of this highly degraded peatland with a shallow peat layer is relatively moderate and hardly influenced by interannual weather variations.

AB Globally, large-scale land drainage has severely deteriorated the functioning and services of peatlands, making restoration plans of the utmost importance. Rewetting is essential for the restoration of drained peatlands, but the level of success including greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation largely depends on the soil microbiome interactions under the prevailing biogeochemical conditions. Here, we investigated the effects of inundation of drained iron (Fe) -rich peat topsoils on nutrient release, surface water quality, GHG production and consumption, and on the composition and activity of the microbial community. The effect of the addition of different potential electron acceptors on methane (CH4) production and consumption were studied in incubation experiments. In response to inundation, porewater concentrations of Fe, total inorganic carbon, ammonium, and phosphorus increased. CH4 emissions increased in the control (i.e. without any additions) and Fe(III) oxide amended incubations upon inundation. This could be explained by the increase in the relative abundance of methanogens even though Fe(III) was previously hypothesized to lower methanogenic activity. In contrast, nitrite, nitrate, and sulfate-rich incubations inhibited methanogenesis. The prolonged exposure to nitrogen oxides stimulated denitrification with nitrous oxide (N2O) as the main gaseous product, together with an increase in the relative abundance of denitrifying microorganisms. Our results demonstrate that insights into the changes in microbial communities in relation to soil geochemistry explain differences in responses observed in different peat soils observed upon inundation. The increase in emissions of the potent GHGs CH4 and N2O from Fe-rich peat topsoils are a major adverse effect in the early stage of inundation.

AB Peatlands are globally important areas for carbon preservation; although covering only 3% of global land area, they store 30% of total soil carbon. Lowland peat soils can also be very productive for agriculture, but their cultivation requires drainage as most crops are intolerant of root-zone anoxia. This leads to the creation of oxic conditions in which organic matter becomes vulnerable to mineralisation. Given the demand for high quality agricultural land. 40% of the UK's peatlands have been drained for agricultural use.
   In this study we present the outcomes of a controlled environment experiment conducted on agricultural fen peat to examine possible trade-offs between celery growth (an economically important crop on the agricultural peatlands of eastern England) and emissions of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)) at different temperatures (ambient and ambient +5 degrees C), water table levels (-30 cm, and -50 cm below the surface), and fertiliser use.
   Raising the water table from -50 cm to -30 cm depressed yields of celery, and at the same time decreased the entire ecosystem CO2 loss by 31%. A 5 degrees C temperature increase enhanced ecosystem emissions of CO2 by 25% and increased celery dry shoot weight by 23% while not affecting the shoot fresh weight. Fertiliser addition increased both celery yields and soil respiration by 22%. Methane emissions were generally very low and not significantly different from zero.
   Our results suggest that increasing the water table can lower emissions of greenhouse gases and reduce the rate of peat wastage, but reduces the productivity of celery. If possible, the water table should be raised to -30 cm before and after cultivation, and only decreased during the growing season, as this would reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions and peat loss, potentially not affecting the production of vegetable crops.

AB Drainage of peatlands is expected to turn these ecosystems into carbon sources to the atmosphere. We measured carbon dynamics of a drained forested peatland in southern Finland over 4 years, including one with severe drought during growing season. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) was measured with the eddy covariance method from a mast above the forest. Soil and forest floor CO2 and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured from the strips and from ditches with closed chambers. Biomass and litter production were sampled, and soil subsidence was measured by repeated levellings of the soil surface. The drained peatland ecosystem was a strong sink of carbon dioxide in all studied years. Soil CO2 balance was estimated by subtracting the carbon sink of the growing tree stand from NEE, and it showed that the soil itself was a carbon sink as well. A drought period in one summer significantly decreased the sink through decreased gross primary production. Drought also decreased ecosystem respiration. The site was a small sink for CH4, even when emissions from ditches were taken into account. Despite the continuous carbon sink, peat surface subsided slightly during the 10-year measurement period, which was probably mainly due to compaction of peat. It is concluded that even 50 years after drainage this peatland site acted as a soil C sink due to relatively small changes in the water table and in plant community structure compared to similar undrained sites, and the significantly increased tree stand growth and litter production. Although the site is currently a soil C sink, simulation studies with process models are needed to test whether such sites could remain C sinks when managed for forestry over several tree-stand rotations.

AB Alpine peatlands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are an important soil carbon pool and are extremely sensitive to global change. Duration of drainage and water table drawdown accelerate peatland degradation because the soil changes from an anaerobic to aerobic environment, and climate warming exacerbates this shift. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of drainage on microbial characteristics and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as identify the factors mediating those effects. This study also analyzed whether warming increases the variability of GHG emissions. Watertable drawdown exerted greater influence on microbial communities than duration of drainage did. Watertable drawdown significantly increased the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Basidiomycota, and changes in soil microbiota correlated with differences in GHG emissions across three water-table treatments. Longer drainage was associated with lower GHG emission; watertable drawdown decreased emissions of CO2 and CH4, but increased emission of N2O. In addition, high temperature increased CO2 emission by 75% and N2O emission by 42%, without significantly affecting CH4 emission. Structural equation modelling showed that microbes, especially prokaryotes (r = 0.79, p < 0.05 for all), were the primary factor affecting GHG emissions from drained peatlands. Overall, this study indicates that the watertable exerts a greater effect on GHG emissions than duration of drainage, and that warming increases variability of GHG emissions.

AB Fluxes of methane and nitrous oxide from a wetland were compared to hydrochemistry (NO(3)(-) and SO(4)(2-)) and soil enzyme activities (beta-glucosidase) in an attempt to predict gas fluxes using chemical and enzymatic activities in north Wales, UK. In a one-year survey, the enzyme activities ranged from 0.028 to 0.065 mu mol g(-1) min(-1), while NO(3)(-) and SO(4)(2-) concentrations ranged between 0-0.78 and 5-200 mg L(-1), respectively. Methane and nitrous oxide emissions varied between 0.32-240 and 0.28-5.48 mg m(-1) da(-1), respectively. The field survey was followed by laboratory-based manipulation experiments, from which pilot mathematical models were constructed, and related to the field data. The variation of methane emission was attributed to changes in SO(4)(2-) concentration and temperature at the site. In contrast, NO(3)(-) concentration, water table height, and beta-glucosidase activity were major controlling factors for nitrous oxide emission. The models explained more than 80 % of the variation observed in the field study.

AB Peat is used as a high quality substrate for growing media in horticulture. However, unsustainable peat extraction damages peatland ecosystems, which disappeared to a large extent in Central and South Europe. Furthermore, disturbed peatlands are becoming a source of greenhouse gases due to drainage and excavation. This study is the result of a workshop within the EU COST Action TD1107 (Biochar as option for sustainable resource management), held in Tartu (Estonia) in 2015. The view of stakeholders were consulted on new biochar-based growing media and to what extent peat may be replaced in growing media by new compounds like carbonaceous materials from thermochemical conversion. First positive results from laboratory and greenhouse experiments have been reported with biochar content in growing media ranging up to 50%. Various companies have already started to use biochar as an additive in their growing media formulations. Biochar might play a more important role in replacing peat in growing media, when biochar is available, meets the quality requirements, and their use is economically feasible.

AB Forty percentage of UK peatlands have been drained for agricultural use, which has caused serious peat wastage and associated greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)). In this study, we evaluated potential trade-offs between water-table management practices for minimizing peat wastage and greenhouse gas emissions, while seeking to sustain romaine lettuce production: one of the most economically relevant crop in the East Anglian Fenlands. In a controlled environment experiment, we measured lettuce yield, CO2, CH4 fluxes and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released from an agricultural fen soil at two temperatures (ambient and +2 degrees C) and three water-table levels (-30 cm, -40 cm and -50 cm below the surface). We showed that increasing the water table from the currently used field level of -50 cm to -40 cm and -30 cm reduced CO2 emissions, did not affect CH4 fluxes, but significantly reduced yield and increased DOC leaching. Warming of 2 degrees C increased both lettuce yield (fresh leaf biomass) and peat decomposition through the loss of carbon as CO2 and DOC. However, there was no difference in the dry leaf biomass between the intermediate (-40 cm) and the low (-50 cm) water table, suggesting that romaine lettuce grown at this higher water level should have similar energetic value as the crop cultivated at -50 cm, representing a possible compromise to decrease peat oxidation and maintain agricultural production.

AB Methane and carbon dioxide emissions from two Scottish peat soils and two Japanese paddy soils were compared. During aerobic incubation, CH4 uptake occurred with the peat soils showing a slightly higher activity than the paddy soils. Temperature exerted a marked effect on CO2 production but had a negligible effect on CH, uptake rate except at 30 degrees C where two soils showed a slight emission of CH4. At 10 and 20 degrees C, the mean first order uptake rate constant for all soils was 0.19 d(-1). With anaerobic incubation, CO2 production decreased while CH4 emission was promoted. The highest production (ng CH4-C g(-1) fresh wt. soil over 7 d) originated from the indigenous bog peat (4,500) while that from the other peat soil (10), from an area of drained and forested bog, was less than the production from either paddy soils (290 and 140). The proportion of carbon emitted as CH4 reached 11% for the bog pear, 1% for the paddy soils but only 0.02% for the forest peat. Though organic matter levels played some role in CH4 emission, the population level of methanogens determined by previous land use was thought to be the major factor controlling this process. Hence, greater differences, particularly for CH4 emission, were found between the two peat soils as a result of previous flooding history than was found between the peat and paddy soils.

AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes from a seminatural, extensively sheep-grazed drained moorland and intensively sheep-grazed fertilised grassland in South East (SE) Scotland were compared over 4 yr (2007-2010). Nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured by static chambers, respiration from soil plus ground vegetation by a flow-through chamber, and the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) by eddy-covariance. All GHG fluxes displayed high temporal and interannual variability. Temperature, radiation, water table height and precipitation could explain a significant percentage of seasonal and interannual variations. Greenhouse gas fluxes were dominated by the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 at both sites. Net ecosystem exchange of CO2 and respiration was much larger on the productive fertilised grassland (-1567 and 7157 gCO(2eq) m(-2) yr(-1), respectively) than on the seminatural moorland (-267 and 2554 gCO(2eq) m(-2) yr(-1), respectively). Large ruminant CH4 (147 gCO(2eq) m(-2) yr(-1)) and soil N2O (384 gCO(2eq) m(-2) yr(-1)) losses from the grazed grassland counteracted the CO2 uptake by 34 %, whereas the small N2O (0.8 gCO(2eq) m(-2) yr(-1)) and CH4 (7 gCO(2eq) m(-2) yr(-1)) emissions from the moorland only impacted the NEE flux by 3 %. The 4-yr average GHG budget for the grazed grassland was -1034 gCO(2eq) m(-2) yr(-1) and -260 gCO(2eq) m(-2) yr(-1) for the moorland.

AB Bare peat surfaces created by frost action and wind erosion in permafrost peatlands have been shown to emit high amounts of nitrous oxide (N2O). With global warming, emissions of this highly potent greenhouse gas are expected to increase in Arctic permafrost peatlands. In natural unmanaged soils with low nitrogen deposition, such as Arctic soils, nitrification is the main source of nitrite and nitrate, and thus a key driver of N2O emissions. Here, we investigated nitrification, ammonia oxidizer populations and N2O production in vegetated and bare peat soils from four distant Arctic geographic locations. Through a combination of molecular analyses and group-specific inhibitor assays, we show that ammonia oxidation, the first step in nitrification, is mainly performed by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). All soils from different locations, including bare peat soils with high N2O emissions, harbored only two AOA phylotypes, including an organism closely related to Ca. Nitrosocosmicus spp. This indicates that high N2O emissions from these ecosystems are primarily fueled by nitrification mediated by very few archaeal species. To our knowledge, arctic peat soils in this study are the first natural environments where high N2O emissions have been linked to AOA. Any changes in archaeal nitrification induced by global warming will therefore impact on N2O emissions from the permafrost peatlands.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) inventories are important tools for studying the effects of land-use and climate change and evaluating climate-change policies. A detailed inventory of SOC in the agricultural soils of the federal state of Baden-Wurttemberg was therefore prepared based on the highest-resolution geo-referenced soil, land-use, and climate data (BUK200 inventory). In order to estimate the quality of different approaches, C inventories of the region were also prepared based on data from the National Inventory Report (UBA, 2003) and by applying the IPCC (1997) method to the two data sets. Finally, the BUK200 inventory was used to estimate potentials of no-tillage agriculture (NT) and peatland restoration to contribute to C sequestration and greenhouse-gas (GHG)-emission mitigation since both measures are discussed in this context. Scenario assumptions were change to NT on 40% of the cropland and restoration of 50% of cultivated peatlands within 20 years.
   On average, grasslands contained 9.5 kg C m(-2) to 0.3 m depth as compared to only 6.0 kg C m(-2) under cropland, indicating strong land-use effects. The SOC content depended strongly on waterlogging and elevation, thus reflecting reduced C mineralization under aquic moisture regimes and low temperatures. Comparison of the BUK200 inventory with the approach used for UBA (2003) showed high inconsistencies due to map resolution and SOC contents, whereas the IPCC method led to fairly good agreements. Results on the simulated effects of NT and peatland restoration suggested that 5%-14% of total agricultural GHG emissions could be abated with NT whereas peat restoration appeared to have a minor mitigation potential (0.2%-2.7%) because the total area of cultivated organic soils was too small to have larger impact.

AB Peatland habitats are important carbon stocks that also have the potential to be significant sources of greenhouse gases, particularly when subject to changes such as artificial drainage and application of fertilizer. Models aiming to estimate greenhouse gas release from peatlands require an accurate estimate of the diffusion coefficient of gas transport through soil (D-s). The availability of specific measurements for peatland soils is currently limited. This study measured D-s for a peat soil with an overlying clay horizon and compared values with those from widely available models. The D-s value of a sandy loam reference soil was measured for comparison. Using the Currie (1960) method, D-s was measured between an air-filled porosity (E) range of 0 and 0.5cm(3) cm(-3). Values of D-s for the peat cores ranged between 3.2x10(-4) and 4.4x10(-3) m(2) hour(-1), for loamy clay cores between 0 and 4.7x10(-3) m(2) hour(-1) and for the sandy reference soil they were between 5.4x10(-4) and 3.4x10(-3) m(2) hour(-1). The agreement of measured and modelled values of relative diffusivity (D-s/D-0, with D-0 the diffusion coefficient through free air) varied with soil type; however, the Campbell (1985) model provided the best replication of measured values for all soils. This research therefore suggests that the use of the Campbell model in the absence of accurately measured D-s and porosity values for a study soil would be appropriate. Future research into methods to reduce shrinkage of peat during measurement and therefore allow measurement of D-s for a greater range of E would be beneficial.

AB Afforestation has been proposed as a strategy to mitigate the often high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agricultural soils with high organic matter content. However, the carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes after afforestation can be considerable, depending predominantly on site drainage and nutrient availability. Studies on the full GHG budget of afforested organic soils are scarce and hampered by the uncertainties associated with methodology. In this study we determined the GHG budget of a spruce-dominated forest on a drained organic soil with an agricultural history. Two different approaches for determining the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) were applied, for the year 2008, one direct (eddy covariance) and the other indirect (analyzing the different components of the GHG budget), so that uncertainties in each method could be evaluated. The annual tree production in 2008 was 8.3 +/- 3.9 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) due to the high levels of soil nutrients, the favorable climatic conditions and the fact that the forest was probably in its phase of maximum C assimilation or shortly past it. The N2O fluxes were determined by the closed-chamber technique and amounted to 0.9 +/- 0.8 t C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1). According to the direct measurements from the eddy covariance technique, the site acts as a minor GHG sink of -1.2 +/- 0.8 t C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1). This contrasts with the NEE estimate derived from the indirect approach which suggests that the site is a net GHG emitter of 0.6 +/- 4.5 t C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1). Irrespective of the approach applied, the soil CO2 effluxes counter large amounts of the C sequestration by trees. Due to accumulated uncertainties involved in the indirect approach, the direct approach is considered the more reliable tool. As the rate of C sequestration will likely decrease with forest age, the site will probably become a GHG source once again as the trees do not compensate for the soil C and N losses. Also forests in younger age stages have been shown to have lower C assimilation rates; thus, the overall GHG sink potential of this afforested nutrient-rich organic soil is probably limited to the short period of maximum C assimilation.

AB Re-wetting minerotrophic fens has become an important strategy to mitigate climate change in Germany. However, recent studies report raised methane (CH4) effluxes during the first years after flooding. A minerotrophic fen in north-east Germany that was re-wetted 15 years ago was exposed to exceptionally heavy rainfall and freshwater flooding in August 2011. We measured CH4 effluxes from wetland vegetation stands dominated by Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud., Typha latifolia L. and Carex acutiformis Ehrh., using the closed-chamber method, fortnightly from March 2011 to March 2012 with extra sampling during the flooding. The respective annual effluxes of CH4 (mean +/- 1 standard error) from the three vegetation types were 18.5 +/- 1.3, 21.1 +/- 1.2 and 47.5 +/- 5.0 g m(-2) a(-1), with the August effluxes contributing 40 %, 50 % and 10 % of the annual effluxes. Despite the freshwater flooding in August, annual CH4 effluxes from the 15-year re-wetted fen are similar to those reported from pristine fens. These results are promising because they indicate that, although CH4 effluxes are elevated after re-wetting, they may return to values typical for pristine fens after 15 years. Hence, re-wetting can achieve the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas effluxes from drained minerotrophic fens.

AB Climate warming is expected to increasingly influence boreal peatlands and alter their greenhouse gases emissions. However, the effects of warming on N2O fluxes and the N2O budgets were ignored in boreal peatlands. Therefore, in a boreal peatland of permafrost zone in Northeast China, a simulated warming experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of warming on N2O fluxes in Betula. Fruticosa community (B. Fruticosa) and Ledum. palustre community (L. palustre) during the growing seasons from 2013 to 2015. Results showed that warming treatment increased air temperature at 1.5 m aboveground and soil temperature at 5 cm depth by 0.6 degrees C and 2 degrees C, respectively. The average seasonal N2O fluxes ranged from 6.62 to 9.34 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in the warming plot and ranged from 0.41 to 4.55 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in the control plots. Warming treatment increased N2O fluxes by 147% and transformed the boreal peatlands from a N2O sink to a source. The primary driving factors for N2O fluxes were soil temperature and active layer depth, whereas soil moisture showed a weak correlation with N2O fluxes. The results indicated that warming promoted N2O fluxes by increasing soil temperature and active layer depth in a boreal peatland of permafrost zone in Northeast China. Moreover, elevated N2O fluxes persisted in this region will potentially drive a noncarbon feedback to ongoing climate change. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Annual terrestrial balances of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are presented for a managed fen meadow in the Netherlands for 2006, 2007 and 2008, using eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements. Annual emissions derived from different methods are compared. The most accurate annual CH4 flux is achieved by gap filling EC fluxes with an empirical multivariate regression model, with soil temperature and mean wind velocity as driving variables. This model explains about 60% of the variability in observed daily CH4 fluxes. Annual N2O emissions can be separated into background emissions and event emissions due to fertilization. The background emission is estimated using a multivariate regression model also based on EC flux data, with soil temperature and mean wind velocity as driving variables. The event emissions are estimated using emission factors. The minimum direct emission factor is derived for six fertilization events by subtracting the background emission, and the IPCC default emission factor of 1% is used for the other events. In addition, the maximum direct emission factors are determined for the six events without subtracting the background emission. The average direct emission factor ranges from 1.2 to 2.8%, which is larger than the IPCC default value. Finally, the total terrestrial greenhouse gas balance is estimated at 16 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in CO2-equivalents with contributions of 30, 25 and 45% by CO2, CH4 and N2O, respectively.

AB Cultivation of bioenergy crops in rewetted peatland (paludiculture) is considered as a possible land use option to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, bioenergy crops like reed canary grass (RCG) can have a complex influence on GHG fluxes. Here we determined the effect of RCG cultivation on GHG emission from peatland rewetted to various extents. Mesocosms were manipulated to three different ground water levels (GWLs), i.e. 0, -10 and 20 cm below the soil surface in a controlled semi-field facility. Emissions of CO2 (ecosystem respiration, ER), CH4 and N2O from mesocosms with RCG and bare soil were measured at weekly to fortnightly intervals with static chamber techniques for a period of 1 year. Cultivation of RCG increased both ER and CH4 emissions, but decreased the N2O emissions. The presence of RCG gave rise to 69, 75 and 85% of total ER at 20, 10 and 0 cm GWL, respectively. However, this difference was due to decreased soil respiration at the rising GWL as the plant-derived CO2 flux was similar at all three GWLs. For methane, 70-95% of the total emission was due to presence of RCG, with the highest contribution at 20 cm GWL. In contrast, cultivation of RCG decreased N2O emission by 33-86% with the major reductions at 10 and 20 cm GWL. In terms of global warming potential, the increase in CH4 emissions due to RCG cultivation was more than offset by the decrease in N2O emissions at 10 and 20 cm GWL; at 0 cm GWL the CH4 emissions was offset only by 23 %. CO2 emissions from ER were obviously the dominant RCG-derived GHG flux, but aboveground biomass yields, and preliminary measurements of gross photosynthetic production, showed that ER could be more than balanced due to the photosynthetic uptake of CO2 by RCG. Our results support that RCG cultivation could be a good land use option in terms of mitigating GHG emission from rewetted peatlands, potentially turning these ecosystems into a sink of atmospheric CO2.

AB Peatlands are important ecosystems in the context of biospheric feedback to climate change, due to the large storage of organic C in peatland soils. Nitrogen deposition and increased nutrient availability in soils following climate warming may cause changes in these ecosystems affecting greenhouse gas exchange. We have conducted an N and P fertilization experiment in two Swedish bogs subjected to high and low background N deposition, and measured the exchange of CO2, CH4 and N2O using the closed chamber technique. During the second year of fertilization, both gross primary production and ecosystem respiration were significantly increased by N addition in the northernmost site where background N deposition is low, while gross primary production was stimulated by P addition in the southern high N deposition site. In addition, a short-term response in respiration was seen following fertilization in both sites, probably associated with rapid growth of nutrient-limited soil microorganisms. No treatment effect was seen on the CH4 exchange, while N2O emission peaks were detected in N fertilized plots indicating the importance of taking N2O into consideration under increased N availability. In a longer term, increased nutrient availability will cause changes in plant composition, which will further act to regulate the peatland greenhouse gas exchange.

AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from wetlands typically exhibit extended low-flux phases accompanied by distinct high-flux events. Prediction and explanation of flux occurrence is hindered by various interactions of the underlying environmental predictors. Here, a novel approach is described to gain insight in patterns of environmental factors, which lead to elevated emissions. Natural neighbor interpolation was utilized to construct flux intensity maps based on two environmental predictors, the ground water level and soil temperature. Further, the effect of inhomogeneous data density was considered by filtering estimates for sufficient information content. The practical application was exemplified by CH4 and N2O flux field data of three years from two fen sites in southwest Germany. This approach considered factor interactions as well as the fluxes occurring as rare events. The application can be useful for the delineation of driving conditions for high-flux events as well as for wetland management practice.

AB Northern peat soils are both sources and sinks of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). These fluxes are regulated by the activity of microbial communities. Temporal, spatial and depth related differences in potential activity and composition of the denitrifier and methanotrophic bacterial communities were compared between winter and summer in relation to in situ fluxes of N2O and CH4 from a drained and forested peat land in Sweden. The composition of the genetic pool of these guilds was assessed using terminal fragment length polymorphism analysis of signature genes in the denitrification and methane oxidation pathways, respectively. The composition of the communities was similar throughout the soil profile, although both denitrification and methane oxidation rates decreased with soil depth. The potential methane oxidation rates were significantly correlated to soil N content, and , indicating a nitrogen induced stimulation of methane oxidation capacity. The site was a source of N2O and a small sink for CH4, and although the fluxes did not vary significantly over time, both the methane oxidizing and denitrifier community composition exhibited temporal patterns. Differences in the composition of the methanotrophic community reflected that the peat site shifted from a summer to a winter community. The denitrifiers exhibited a similar trend, but also differed significantly between the sampling occasions during summer, as well as between locations at the site. The latter was explained by differences in soil pH. It was only the differences in the methane oxidizer community composition that correlated with its corresponding potential activity, which implies a higher degree of functional redundancy within the denitrifier community.

AB Peatlands are known as N2O sinks or low N2O sources due to nitrogen (N) limitation. However, climate warming and N deposition can modulate this limitation, and little is known about the combinative effects of them on N2O emission from boreal peatlands. In this study, experimental warming and N fertilization treatments were conducted at a boreal peatland in western Newfoundland, Canada. Contrary to previous studies on permafrost peatland and alpine meadows, the effect of warming treatment on N2O flux was not detectable during the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016. The N fertilization treatment significantly increased the N2O flux by 1.61 nmol m(-2) S-1 due to increased N availability. Noticeably, warming reduced the effect of N fertilization treatment on N2O flux with high significance in the middle growing season of 2015. This can be attributed to low N availability caused by stimulated vegetation growth in the warming treatment. In addition, the results showed that total nitrogen was the main control on N2O emission under N fertilization, while dissolved organic carbon was the main driver under the combined treatment of warming and N fertilization. Due to elevated N2O emissions under N deposition/fertilization, the contribution of N2O to global warming and ozone depletion should not be ignored. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Drained organic soils are large sources of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) in many European and Asian countries. Therefore, these soils urgently need to be considered and adequately accounted for when attempting to decrease emissions from the Agriculture and Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sectors. Here, we describe the methodology, data and results of the German approach for measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of anthropogenic GHG emissions from drained organic soils and outline ways forward towards tracking drainage and rewetting. The methodology was developed for and is currently applied in the German GHG inventory under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol.
   Spatial activity data comprise high resolution maps of land-use, type of organic soil and mean annual water table (WT). The WT map was derived by a boosted regression trees model from data of more than 1000 dipwells. Emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) were synthesized from a unique national data set comprising more than 250 annual GHG balances from 118 sites in most land-use categories and types of organic soils. Measurements were performed with harmonized protocols using manual chambers. Nonlinear response functions describe the dependency of CO2 and CH4 fluxes on mean annual WT, stratified by land-use where appropriate. Modelling results were aggregated into "implied emission factors" for each land-use category, taking into account the uncertainty of the response functions, the frequency distribution of the WT within each land-use category and further GHG sources such as dissolved organic carbon or CH4 emissions from ditches. IPCC default emission factors were used for these minor GHG sources. In future, response functions could be applied directly when appropriate WT data is available. As no functional relationship was found for N2O emissions, emission factors were calculated as the mean observed flux per land-use category. In Germany, drained organic soils emit more than 55 million tons of GHGs per year, of which 91% are CO2. This is equivalent to around 6.6% of the national GHG emissions in 2014. Thus, they are the largest GHG source from agriculture and LULUCF. The described methodology is applicable on the project scale as well as in other countries where similar data are collected.

AB A portable infrared laser absorption spectrometer named SPIRIT (SPectrometre Infra-Rouge In situ Tropospherique) has been set up for the simultaneous flux measurements of trace gases at the geosphere-atmosphere interface. It uses a continuous wave distributed feedback room temperature quantum cascade laser and a patented new optical multi-pass cell. The aim of SPIRIT field studies is to get a better understanding of land and water bodies to atmosphere exchange mechanisms of greenhouse gases (GHG). The analytical procedures to derive concentrations and fluxes are described, as well as the performances of the instrument under field conditions. The ability of SPIRIT to assess space and time dependence emissions of two GHG-nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4)-for different types of ecosystems is demonstrated through in situ measurements on peatland, on fertilized soil, and on water body systems. The objectives of these investigations and preliminary significant results are reported.

AB Wetlands are the largest source of methane (CH4) globally, yet our understanding of how process-level controls scale to ecosystem fluxes remains limited. It is particularly uncertain how variable soil properties influence ecosystem CH4 emissions on annual time scales. We measured ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 fluxes by eddy covariance from two wetlands recently restored on peat and alluvium soils within the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California. Annual CH4 fluxes from the alluvium wetland were significantly lower than the peat site for multiple years following restoration, but these differences were not explained by variation in dominant climate drivers or productivity across wetlands. Soil iron (Fe) concentrations were significantly higher in alluvium soils, and alluvium CH4 fluxes were decoupled from plant processes compared with the peat site, as expected when Fe reduction inhibits CH4 production in the rhizosphere. Soil carbon content and CO2 uptake rates did not vary across wetlands and, thus, could also be ruled out as drivers of initial CH4 flux differences. Differences in wetland CH4 fluxes across soil types were transient; alluvium wetland fluxes were similar to peat wetland fluxes 3years after restoration. Changing alluvium CH4 emissions with time could not be explained by an empirical model based on dominant CH4 flux biophysical drivers, suggesting that other factors, not measured by our eddy covariance towers, were responsible for these changes. Recently accreted alluvium soils were less acidic and contained more reduced Fe compared with the pre-restoration parent soils, suggesting that CH4 emissions increased as conditions became more favorable to methanogenesis within wetland sediments. This study suggests that alluvium soil properties, likely Fe content, are capable of inhibiting ecosystem-scale wetland CH4 flux, but these effects appear to be transient without continued input of alluvium to wetland sediments.

AB This paper presents estimates of the costs and benefits of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through fen wetland restoration. This study takes previous research on GHG emissions from peat wetlands further by coupling water-level-dependent emission functions with a landscape- and basin-scale assessment of the hydrology and water management of wetlands. For this purpose we use a water management model for the Elbe River Basin that includes the major lowland fen wetland sites as water users. Based on the resultant estimates of the GHG emissions of wetlands and the reduction potential of management options under a more realistic description of water availability, this paper provides improved estimates of the benefits of restoration in terms of the shadow price of carbon and the GHG abatement costs of wetland restoration measures. An econometric approach is used to develop abatement cost estimates for wetland restoration. We find mean current emissions over 35 wetland sites (3840 km(2)) to be in the range of 17.525.5 tCO2e ha-1. The median of estimated abatement costs for fen stabilisation scenarios are within a range of epsilon 1020 tCO2e-1 and for restoration scenarios in a range of epsilon 714 tCO2e-1. Fen wetland restoration can therefore potentially contribute to mitigation targets at low cost. An approach focused on restoration is a more efficient strategy compared to an approach centred on agri-environmental schemes, even though both components are required in a zoning approach. However the effects of climatic change may reduce the effectiveness of wetland restoration measures by roughly 50%. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Samples (140) of peat collected from bogs, fens and swamps in boreal, subarctic and temperate regions of Canada were incubated at 15 or 20 degrees C for 5 d in the laboratory to determine potential rates of CO2 and CH4 exchange under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Rates of CO2 production ranged between 0.07 and 5.0 mg g(-1) d(-1), with means of 1.0 and 0.5 mg CO2 g(-1) d(-1) for aerobic and anaerobic production rates, respectively. Aerobic and anaerobic CO2 production rates were strongly correlated (r = 0.581, P < 0.001, log(10) transformation) with the former an average of 2.5 times larger than the latter. CO2 production rates were greatest in the upper part of peat profile and appeared to be re lated to the botanical origin of the peat. Aerobic CH4 consumption and anaerobic CH4 production rates ranged from 0.01 to 100 mu g CH4 g(-1) d(-1), with means of 13.1 and 3.1 mu g CH4 g(-1) d(-1), respectively. Rates of CH4 exchange were positively correlated (r = 0.368, P < 0.001, log(10) transformation). Within profiles, maximum CH4 consumption occurred in samples collected from beneath or at the water table, whereas CH4 production occurred mainly in samples collected from beneath the water table. There was no significant correlation between aerobic CH4 consumption and CO2 production, but anaerobic CH4 production was positively correlated with CO2 production (r = 0.36, P < 0.001).

AB Limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and better even to 1.5 degrees Celsius, according to Article 2 paragraph 1 of the Paris Agreement requires global zero emissions in a very short time. These targets imply that not only emissions from degraded peatlands have to be avoided, but conservation and rewetting of peatlands are also necessary to figure as sinks to compensate for unavoidable residual emissions. However, with regard to instruments for meeting these targets, measuring, depicting, and baseline definition are difficult for greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands. In the absence of an easily comprehensible control variable (such as fossil fuels), economic instruments reach their limits. This is remarkable in so far as economic instruments can otherwise handle governance problems and react to various behavioral motivational factors very well. Still, peatlands can be subject to certain regulations and prohibitions under command-and-control law even without precise knowledge of the emissions from peatland use, which will be shown using the example of the European Union (EU) and German legislation. This paper is a contribution to governance research and illustrates that even comprehensive quantity-control instruments for fossil fuels and livestock farming-which would address various environmental problems and reflect findings from behavioral research regarding motivation towards sustainability-require complementary fine-tuning through command-and-control law, e.g., for integrating peatland governance.

AB Bioenergy crop cultivation on former peat extraction areas is a potential after-use option that provides a source of renewable energy while mitigating climate change through enhanced carbon (C) sequestration. This study investigated the full C and greenhouse gas (GHG) balances of fertilized (RCG-F) and nonfertilized (RCG-C) reed canary grass (RCG; Phalaris arundinacea) cultivation compared to bare peat (BP) soil within an abandoned peat extraction area in western Estonia during a dry year. Vegetation sampling, static chamber and lysimeter measurements were carried out to estimate above- and belowground biomass production and allocation, fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in cultivated strips and drainage ditches as well as the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export, respectively. Heterotrophic respiration was determined from vegetation-free trenched plots. Fertilization increased the above- to belowground biomass production ratio and the autotrophic to heterotrophic respiration ratio. The full C balance (incl. CO2, CH4 and DOC fluxes from strips and ditches) was 96, 215 and 180g Cm(-2)yr(-1) in RCG-F, RCG-C and BP, respectively, suggesting that all treatments acted as C sources during the dry year. The C balance was driven by variations in the net CO2 exchange, whereas the combined contribution of CH4 and DOC fluxes was <5%. The GHG balances were 3.6, 7.9 and 6.6t CO2 eqha(-1)yr(-1) in RCG-F, RCG-C and BP, respectively. The CO2 exchange was also the dominant component of the GHG balance, while the contributions of CH4 and N2O were <1% and 1-6%, respectively. Overall, this study suggests that maximizing plant growth and the associated CO2 uptake through adequate water and nutrient supply is a key prerequisite for ensuring sustainable high yields and climate benefits in RCG cultivations established on organic soils following drainage and peat extraction.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT

AB Globally, peatlands have a high potential in mitigating climate change, but no study has been done on this in the Philippines. This study estimated the amount of stored carbon (C) in the Caimpugan peatland, Agusan Marsh In Tall Pole Forest, Intermediate Forest, and the Pygmy Forests in two locations in the peatland, the aboveground C stocks were measured in standing trees, understorey, herbaceous vegetation, and litter. In addition, belowground C stocks were also measured in peat soils at different horizons. Non-destructive sampling was done for trees > 5 cm dbh using allometric equations. Total soil organic C was determined using Flash Elemental Analyzer 1112 Series Carbon Analyzer. A two-way ANOVA was used to compare estimated stored C among selected vegetation Ogles with location as the replication. The estimated aboveground C stock of Caimpugan peatland was 22.9 Mt of C within its 5, 487 ha of area with an estimated 3,000-6,000 t of C on a per hectare basis. The estimated mean belowground C stock (4,659 t C ha(-1)) was much higher than the mean aboveground C stock (53 tC ha(-1)). With the substantial amount of stored C in Caimpugan peatland, its protection is fundamental to enhance its role in mitigating CO2 emissions.

AB For implementation of sustainable land use strategies in Europe tools for evaluating long-term changes of peatland functions are essential. Therefore a semi-quantitative peatland management decision support system for agricultural used peatlands in Europe was developed. It is called Peatland Management Decision Support System (PMDSS). The aim of the tool is to better understand and to forecast long-term processes in peatland ecosystems in order to help scientists, water boards and environmental agencies in decision making about long-term management. PMDSS is based on derived indicators of ecosystem functions of peatlands, which are: harvest of plant products, land use category, mean summer water table (MSWT), nitrogen discharge, Global Warming Potential (GWP) and conservation value of plants. PMDSS is realized as an easy to use spreadsheet program in Excel. The model is one-dimensional and applicable for a site or field, where the input parameters, particularly land use category, vegetation type and MSWT are relatively homogenous. It is running with annual intervals and for a time span of 100 years (vegetation 50 years). Results are presented as values, text and diagrams. PMDSS is accessible via internet.
   PMDSS was applied to sites in several European countries. A case study in the Eider Valley peatland is presented, which is typical for Weichselian landscapes of northwest Germany. The site has a deep peat layer and is mainly influenced by groundwater discharge. It was used as a meadow and pasture during the past centuries and is left abandoned since the mid 1990s. Effects of different land use and water management scenarios onto the development of the site are determined. The scenarios are typical for peatland sites in northwest Germany and northwest Europe. Results are plausible as a rough estimate of magnitude and development trend. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The thawing of ice-rich permafrost soils in northern peatlands leads to the formation of thermokarst ponds, surrounded by organic-rich soils. These aquatic ecosystems are sites of intense microbial activity, and CO2 and CH4 emissions. Many of the pond systems in northern landscapes and their surrounding peatlands are hydrologically contiguous, but little is known about the microbial connectivity of concentric habitats around the thermokarst ponds, or the effects of peat accumulation and infilling on the microbial communities. Here we investigated microbial community structure and abundance in a thermokarst pond-peatland system in subarctic Canada. Several lineages were ubiquitous, supporting a prokaryotic continuum from the thermokarst pond to surrounding peatlands. However, the microbial community structure shifted from typical aerobic freshwater microorganisms (Betaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria) in the pond towards acidophilic and anaerobic lineages (Acidobacteria and Choroflexi) in the connected peatland waters, likely selected by the acidification of the water by Sphagnum mosses. Marked changes in abundance and community composition of methane cycling microorganisms were detected along the thermokarst pond-peatland transects, suggesting fine tuning of C-1 carbon cycling within a highly connected system, and warranting the need for higher spatial resolution across the thermokarst landscape to accurately predict net greenhouse gas emissions from northern peatlands.

AB Drainage of peatlands causes severe environmental damage, including high greenhouse gas emissions. Peatland rewetting substantially lowers these emissions. After rewetting, paludiculture (i.e. agriculture and forestry on wet peatlands) is a promising land use option. In Northeast Germany (291,361 ha of peatland) a multi-stakeholder discussion process about the implementation of paludiculture took place in 2016/2017. Currently, 57% of the peatland area is used for agriculture (7% as arable land, 50% as permanent grassland), causing greenhouse gas emissions of 4.5 Mt CO(2)eq a(-1). By rewetting and implementing paludiculture, up to 3 Mt CO(2)eq a(-1)from peat soils could be avoided. To safeguard interests of both nature conservation and agriculture, the different types of paludiculture were grouped into 'cropping paludiculture' and 'permanent grassland paludiculture'. Based on land legislation and plans, a paludiculture land classification was developed. On 52% (85,468 ha) of the agriculturally used peatlands any type of paludiculture may be implemented. On 30% (49,929 ha), both cropping and permanent grassland paludiculture types are possible depending on administrative check. On 17% (28,827 ha), nature conservation restrictions allow only permanent grassland paludiculture. We recommend using this planning approach in all regions with high greenhouse gas emissions from drained peatlands to avoid land use conflicts.

AB Freshwater wetlands provide a range of ecosystem services, one of which is climate regulation. They are known to contain large pools of carbon (C) that can be affected by land-use change. In New Zealand, only 10 % of the original freshwater wetlands remain due to conversion into agriculture. This study presents the first national estimation of C stocks in freshwater wetlands based on the compilation of soil carbon data from 126 sites across the country. We estimated C stocks for two soil sample types (mineral and organic) in different classes of wetlands (fen, bog, swamp, marsh, pakihi and ephemeral), and extrapolated C stocks to national level using GIS. Bogs had high C content and low bulk densities, while ephemeral wetlands were the reverse. A regression between bulk density and C content showed a high influence of the soil type. Average C densities (average +/- A standard error) were 1,348 +/- A 184 t C ha(-1) at full peat depth (average of 3.9 m) and 102 +/- A 5 t C ha(-1) (0.3 m depth) for organic soils, and 121 +/- A 24 t C ha(-1) (0.3 m depth) for mineral soils. At national level, C stocks were estimated at 11 +/- A 1 Mt (0.3 m depth) and 144 +/- A 17 Mt (full peat depth) in organic soils, and 23 +/- A 1 Mt (0.3 m depth) in mineral soils. Since European settlement, 146,000 ha of organic soils have been converted to agriculture, which could release between 0.5 and 2 Mt CO2 year(-1), equivalent to 1-6 % of New Zealand's total agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Marginal organic soils, abundant in the boreal region, are being increasingly used for bioenergy crop cultivation. Using long-term field experimental data on greenhouse gas (GHG) balance from a perennial bioenergy crop [reed canary grass (RCG), Phalaris arundinaceae L.] cultivated on a drained organic soil as an example, we show here for the first time that, with a proper cultivation and land-use practice, environmentally sound bioenergy production is possible on these problematic soil types. We performed a life cycle assessment (LCA) for RCG on this organic soil. We found that, on an average, this system produces 40% less CO2-equivalents per MWh of energy in comparison with a conventional energy source such as coal. Climatic conditions regulating the RCG carbon exchange processes have a high impact on the benefits from this bioenergy production system. Under appropriate hydrological conditions, this system can even be carbon-negative. An LCA sensitivity analysis revealed that net ecosystem CO2 exchange and crop yield are the major LCA components, while non-CO2 GHG emissions and costs associated with crop production are the minor ones. Net bioenergy GHG emissions resulting from restricted net CO2 uptake and low crop yields, due to climatic and moisture stress during dry years, were comparable with coal emissions. However, net bioenergy emissions during wet years with high net uptake and crop yield were only a third of the coal emissions. As long-term experimental data on GHG balance of bioenergy production are scarce, scientific data stemming from field experiments are needed in shaping renewable energy source policies.

AB This article reports a dataset on 8 years of monitoring carbon fluxes in a subarctic palsa mire based on micrometeorological eddy covariance measurements. The mire is a complex with wet minerotrophic areas and elevated dry palsa as well as intermediate sub-ecosystems. The measurements document primarily the emission originating from the wet parts of the mire dominated by a rather homogenous cover of Eriophorum angustifolium. The CO2/CH4 flux measurements performed during the years 2001-2008 showed that the areas represented in the measurements were a relatively stable sink of carbon with an average annual rate of uptake amounting to on average -46 g C m(-2) y(-1) including an equally stable loss through CH4 emissions (18-22 g CH4-C m(-2) y(-1)). This consistent carbon sink combined with substantial CH4 emissions is most likely what is to be expected as the permafrost under palsa mires degrades in response to climate warming.

ID CARBON-DIOXIDE EMISSIONS; RANK; COMBUSTION
AB Emission factors are used in greenhouse gas inventories to estimate emissions from coal combustion. In the absence of direct measures, emissions factors are frequently used as a quick, low cost way to estimate emissions values. Coal combustion has been a major contributor to the CO2 flux into the atmosphere. Nearly all of the fuel carbon (99 %) in coal is converted to CO2 during the combustion process. The carbon content is the most important coal parameter which is the measure of the degree of coalification (coal rank). Coalification is the alteration of vegetation to form peat, succeeded by the transformation of peat through lignite, sub-bituminous, bituminous to anthracite coal. During the geochemical or metamorphic stage, the progressive changes that occur within the coal are an increase in the carbon content and a decrease in the hydrogen and oxygen content resulting in a loss of volatiles. Heterogeneous composition of coal causes variation in CO2 emission from different coals.
   The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has produced guidelines on how to produce emission inventories which includes emission factors. Although 2006 IPCC Guidelines provided the default values specified according to the rank of the coal, the application of country-specific emission factors was recommended when estimating the national greenhouse gas emissions. This paper discusses the differences between country-specific emission factors and default IPCC CO2 emission factors, EF(CO2), for coals. Also, this study estimated EF(CO2) for two different types of coals and peat from B&H, on the basis fuel analyses.
   Carbon emission factors for coal mainly depend on the carbon content of the fuel and vary with both rank and geographic origin, which supports the idea of provincial variation of carbon emission factors. Also, various other factors, such as content of sulphur, minerals and macerals play an important role and influence EF(CO2) from coal. Carbonate minerals (calcite and siderite) directly contribute CO2 when they decompose during coal combustion. Variations in the maceral content can also influence CO2 emissions; high inertinite contents increase CO2 emissions. Sulphur in coal reduces EF(CO2).
   Fuel analysis is very important when estimating greenhouse gas emissions and emission factors. In this preliminary study, based on the results of the fuel analysis, CO2 emission factors for coals and peat from Livno, B&H have been calculated. EF(CO2) is defined as the amount of carbon dioxide emission per unit net calorific values of the fuel. Net calorific value (the lower heating value) corresponds to the heat produced by combustion where total water in the combustion products exists as water vapour.
   The EF(CO2) obtained for sub-bituminous coal, lignite and peat were: 98.7, 109.5, and 147.9 t TJ(-1), respectively, which correspond to the following net calorific values: 20.6, 11.5 and 3.6 MJ kg(-1). The heating value is generally known to increase with the increase in carbon content (this parameter is connected with the degree of coalification, coal age). The other indispensable parameters are hydrogen, which has a positive effect on the net calorific value, and oxygen and water which impact the net calorific value negatively. The differences in net calorific values can be explained in part by the difference of total moisture content among the different fuel types.
   The CO2 emission factors calculated in this study were compared with those of IPCC. A significant difference was observed for peat (39.5 %), followed by lignite (8.2 %) and sub-bituminous coal (4.3 %).

Boreal Env. Res. 18: 109-126.
   We studied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from drainage ditches and leaching losses in a boreal cutaway peatland cultivated with reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) for bioenergy. The objectives of the study were to assess to what extent GHG emissions from drainage ditches and leaching of carbon and nutrients via surface drainage contribute to the total losses of carbon and nitrogen from the site. The emissions of CH4, N2O and CO2 were measured with static chamber methods for three years and leaching losses for seven years. On average, the drainage ditches (covering 6% of the study site area) released 10% of the total CH4 emission (0.33 g m(-2) a(-1)), and 1% and 5% of the total N2O and CO2 emissions, respectively. Leaching of total nitrogen and phosphorous were 0.31 and 0.03 g m(-2) a(-1), respectively. Leaching values were lower than those reported for agricultural catchments in general.

AB Availability of reactive nitrogen (N-r; mainly ammonium, NH4+, and nitrate, NO3-) via precipitation and upwelling groundwater affects carbon (C) accumulation in peat deposits and biological greenhouse gas emissions. Isotope composition of Nr was studied at Wolf Swamp (WS) and The Glades (GL), two peatlands located in western Maryland (U.S.), to provide a more robust understanding of N cycling at the ecosystem level. In recent years, both sites experienced a moderate atmospheric pollution (3-9 kg of deposited N-r ha(-1) yr(-1)), and possible additional N-r inputs via groundwater contaminated by fertilizers/livestock. Sampling of living Sphagnum, vertical peat profiles, atmospheric deposition, and surface bog water was carried out on October 22-24, 2017. The delta N-15(r) signatures of vertical precipitation were negative (mass-weighted means of similar to 7.2 and similar to 8.1% at WS and GL, respectively) despite reports that NOx emitted by coal-burning power plants, a precursor of deposited nitrate, had been extremely positive (up to +26 parts per thousand). Mean delta N-15 values at both sites increased in the order: vertical precipitation < living Sphagnum< atmospheric N-2 < surface bog water < maturating peat. Intermediate delta N-15 values of living Sphagnum (similar to 1.5 parts per thousand at both sites) suggested simultaneous incorporation of isotopically light atmospheric N-r and isotopically heavy N-r from bog water in the newly formed biomass. The delta N-15 values of bulk peat increased downcore by 4.5 and 4.9 parts per thousand at WS and GL, respectively. Gradual mineralization of organic N, mainly by nitrification and denitrification, is isotopically selective, leaving behind higher delta N-15 values of bulk peat at greater peat depths. Nitrogen concentration gradients and delta N-15 trends in vertical peat profiles at these locations therefore cannot be used as an archive of past changes in pollution levels and N isotope signatures of incoming N-r.

AB Fens are organic sites that require drainage for agricultural use. Lowering the groundwater level leads to trade-offs between economic benefits and environmental impacts (i.e., CO2 and nutrient emissions). To identify management options that are both environmentally and economically sustainable, a propaedeutic systematic analysis of the costs, income and profit of different land use and management systems on fenlands is necessary. This study provides an overview of the profitability, labor demand and comparative advantages of feasible management systems on German fenlands. Twenty management practices in four land use systems are analyzed. The results indicate that most management systems are profitable only with subsidies and payments for ecosystem services. In addition to sales revenue, these payments are indispensable to promote peat-saving agricultural practices on fenlands. Regarding the labor aspect, intensive management systems caused an increase in working hours per hectare, which may positively affect employment in rural areas. The calculations obtained in this study can be used as a basis for estimations of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation costs when management systems are associated with GHG emission values.

AB We measured the carbon isotopic composition of pore water carbon dioxide from Sallie's Fen, a New Hampshire poor fen. The isotope profiles are used in combination with a one-dimensional diffusion-reaction model to calculate rates of methane production, oxidation and transport over an annual cycle. We show how the rates vary with depth over a seasonal cycle, with methane produced deeper during the winter months and at progressively shallower depths into the summer season. The rates of methane production, constrained by the measured delta 13C(dic) profiles, cannot explain high methane emission during the summer. We suggest that much of the methane produced during this time comes either from the unsaturated peat, or from the top 1-3 cm of saturated peat where episodic exchange with the atmosphere makes it invisible to our method.

AB Peatland pipes are large natural macropores that contribute significantly to streamflow and represent a potentially important transport pathway between terrestrial and aquatic/atmospheric systems. Our study aimed to estimate the contribution of pipe flow to catchment-scale greenhouse gas (GHG) losses (CO2, CH4, and N2O) in a British peatland using a combination of fortnightly spot and continuous sensor measurements. Interpipe variability was high for all GHGs. Mean pipe water concentrations ranged from 0.70 to 6.51 mg C L-1, 0.90 to 897 mu g C L-1, and 0.36 to 1.36 mu g N L-1 for CO2, CH4, and N2O, respectively. High-resolution CO2 data showed temporal changes in the connectivity between pipes and the surrounding peat, with connectivity greatest when water table was high and lowest at low water table depths when discharge was associated with deeper, CO2-enriched sources. Total downstream export from the eight studied pipes represented 3%, 38%, and 3% of CO2, CH4, and N2O export at the catchment outlet, while contributing only similar to 2% of total catchment runoff. Direct degassing of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere was evident from an intensively monitored pipe outlet. Upscaling evasion estimates from the pipe outlets gave conservative catchment-scale emission rates of 7.08 g CO2-eq m(-2) yr(-1) and 50.2 g CO2-eq m(-2) yr(-1) for CO2 and CH4, respectively. Although the catchment-scale estimates contain significant uncertainty, they highlight the potential importance of pipes as a pathway for the release of terrestrially produced GHGs to the atmosphere.

AB Simultaneous chloroform (CHCl(3)) emission and ozone (O(3)) deposition are regularly observed under nocturnal inversions during the summer months from and to the peat bogs in the vicinity of the Mace Head Atmospheric Research Station, Connemara, Co Galway, Ireland. Emissions were estimated using the nocturnal box model applied to routine atmospheric observations collected over a 14-year period from 1995 to 2008. Strict criteria were applied in the selection of events of low wind speed, under a stable night-time inversion layer in baseline air conditions, with no transport from Europe. The mean peatland CHCl(3) flux was 2.91 mu g m(-2) h(-1) with highly variable fluxes ranging from 0.44 to 12.94 mu g m(-2) h(-1). These fluxes are generally larger than those reported previously for similar biomes and if representative would make a significant contribution to the global estimated source of CHCl(3). Fluxes were not strongly correlated with either atmospheric temperature or the level of precipitation. Over the 14-year period there appears to have been a small increase in overall CHCl(3) emissions, although we stress that the nocturnal box model has a number of limitations and assumptions which should be taken into account.

AB While peatland ecosystems overall are long-term net carbon (C) sinks, the open water pools that are characteristic of boreal peatlands have been found to be C sources to the atmosphere. However, the contribution of these pools to the ecosystem level C budget is often ignored even if they cover a significant area of the peatland surface. Here we examine the annual CO2 and CH4 ecosystem-atmosphere exchange, including the release following ice melt, from pools in a boreal maritime peatland, in order to estimate the annual loss of C from these water bodies. Over a 16month period, dissolved CO2 and CH4 were measured periodically in five pools while continuous measurements of CO2 were made in one pool using a nondispersive infrared (NDIR) sensor. Fluxes were calculated using the thin boundary layer model and the eddy covariance technique (spring release only). We calculated an annual C release from pools of 103.3g C m(-2)yr(-1) of which 15% was released during the spring ice melt. This release is the same order of magnitude, but with the opposite sign, as the average net ecosystem carbon balance for pool-free northern peatlands (-22 to -70g C m(-2)yr(-1)). We discuss the origin of the released C, as the magnitude of the release could have a significant impact on the contemporary C exchange of boreal peatlands.

AB Estimates of the greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes resulting from sheep grazing upon upland peat soils have never been fully quantified. Previous studies have been limited to individual flux pathways or to comparing the presence to the absence of sheep grazing. Therefore, this study combines a model of the physical impact of grazing with models of: biomass production; energy usage in sheep; and peat accumulation. These combined modelling approaches enabled this study to consider the indirect and direct impacts of sheep upon the carbon and greenhouse gas balance of a peatland at different grazing intensities as well as the changes between grazing intensities. The study considered four vegetation scenarios (Calluna sp., Molinia sp.; reseeded grasses, and Agrostis-Festuca grassland) and a mixed vegetation scenario based upon the vegetation typical of upland peat ecosystems in northern England. Each scenario was considered for altitudes between 350 and 900 m above sea level and for grazing intensities between 0.1 and 2 ewes/ha. The study can show that the total GHG flux at the vegetative carrying capacity tended to decline with increasing altitude for all vegetation scenarios considered except for Molinia sp. The average total GHG flux for all scenarios was 1505 kg CO(2)eq/ha/yr/(ewe/ha), and on average 89% of the fluxes were directly from the sheep and not from the soil, and are therefore not unique to a peat soil environment. The study suggests that emission factors for upland sheep have been greatly underestimated. By comparing the total flux due to grazers to the flux to or from the soil that allows the study to define a GHG carry capacity, i.e. the grazing intensity at which the flux due to grazing is equal to the sink represented by the peat soils, this GHG carrying capacity varies between 0.2 and 1.7 ewes/ha with this capacity declining with increasing altitude for all model scenarios.

AB A large share of peatlands in northwestern Germany is drained for agricultural purposes, thereby emitting high amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs). In order to quantify the climatic impact of fen soils in dairy farming systems of northern Germany, GHG exchange and forage yield were determined on four experimental sites which differed in terms of management and drainage intensity: (a) rewetted and unutilized grassland (UG), (b) intensive and wet grassland (GW), (c) intensive and moist grassland (GM) and (d) arable forage cropping (AR). Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and fluxes of CH4 and N2O were measured using closed manual chambers. CH4 fluxes were significantly affected by groundwater level (GWL) and soil temperature, whereas N2O fluxes showed a significant relation to the amount of nitrate in top soil. Annual balances of all three gases, as well as the global warming potential (GWP), were significantly correlated to mean annual GWL. A 2-year mean GWP, combined from CO2-C eq. of NEE, CH4 and N2O emissions, as well as C input (slurry) and C output (harvest), was 3.8, 11.7, 17.7 and 17.3MgCO(2)-C eq. ha(-1) a(-1) for sites UG, GW, GM and AR, respectively (standard error (SE) 2.8, 1.2, 1.8, 2.6). Yield-related emissions for the three agricultural sites were 201, 248 and 269 kgCO(2)-C eq. (GJ net energy lactation; NEL) 1 for sites GW, GM and AR, respectively (SE 17, 9, 19). The carbon footprint of agricultural commodities grown on fen soils depended on longterm drainage intensity rather than type of management, but management and climate strongly influenced interannual onsite variability. However, arable forage production revealed a high uncertainty of yield and therefore was an unsuitable land use option. Lowest yield-related GHG emissions were achieved by a three-cut system of productive grassland swards in combination with a high GWL (long-term mean <= 20 cm below the surface).

AB Following the recent international agreements on climate action, there is an urgent need to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Wet cultivation of peatlands (paludiculture) can combine low GHG emissions with productive use of the land, but methods for identifying suitable areas at regional and local scales are lacking. In this study we present a spatial assessment tool for two paludiculture species, namely Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia. This tool is built in a Geographic Information System (GIS) and is designed to perform a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the cultivation potential of land that is currently used for agriculture or peat extraction, within a defined geographical area. It uses a graded assessment process with a plot based analysis. A case study application shows that the tool can deliver first estimates of the potential cultivation area, but further research is needed to enhance its flexibility and scope of application. In its present form it may be used as a decision support instrument for specific sites.

AB To evaluate the effect of vegetation change on greenhouse gas (GHG) budget from a wetland ecosystem, the CO2, CH4 and N2O budgets from whole area (21.5 ha) of the Bibai Wetland, where dwarf bamboo (Sasa) or Ilex has invaded into original Sphagnum dominated vegetation, located in Hokkaido, Japan were estimated. The original Sphagnum-dominated vegetation was changed from a sink to a source of CO2 by invasion of short-Sasa (50 cm > height), while the invasion of tall-Sasa (50 cm < height < 150 cm) or Ilex increased CO2 uptake. Annual CH4 emission was decreased by the invasion of Sasa or Ilex. The annual N2O emission was slightly increased by invasion of Ilex only. These GHG budgets were correlated with the environmental factors related to the water table depth. The distribution of vegetation and environmental factors was estimated from satellite image bands, and the GHG budget of the entire wetland was estimated. The whole wetland area was considered to be a sink for GHG (-113 Mg CO2-eq y(-1)) and CO2 uptake by tall-Sasa occupied 71% of the GHG budget. The vegetation change due to the lowering of the water table depth currently increases the rate of carbon accumulation in the ecosystem by about 5 times.

AB A lysimeter method using undisturbed soil columns was used to investigate the effect of water table depth and soil properties on soil organic matter decomposition and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cultivated peat soils. The study was carried out using cultivated organic soils from two locations in Sweden: Orke, a typical cultivated fen peat with low pH and high organic matter content and Majne-garden, a more uncommon fen peat type with high pH and low organic matter content. Even though carbon and nitrogen contents differ greatly between the sites, carbon and nitrogen density are quite similar. A drilling method with minimal soil disturbance was used to collect 12 undisturbed soil monoliths (50 cm high, 029.5 cm) per site. They were sown with ryegrass (Lolium perenne) after the original vegetation was removed. The lysimeter design allowed the introduction of water at depth so as to maintain a constant water table at either 40 cm or 80 cm below the soil surface. CO(2), CH(4) and N(2)O emissions from the lysimeters were measured weekly and complemented with incubation experiments with small undisturbed soil cores subjected to different tensions (5, 40. 80 and 600 cm water column). CO(2) emissions were greater from the treatment with the high water table level (40 cm) compared with the low level (80 cm). N(2)O emissions peaked in springtime and CH(4) emissions were very low or negative. Estimated GHG emissions during one year were between 2.70 and 3.55 kg CO(2) equivalents m(-2). The results from the incubation experiment were in agreement with emissions results from the lysimeter experiments. We attribute the observed differences in GHG emissions between the soils to the contrasting dry matter liability and soil physical properties. The properties of the different soil layers will determine the effect of water table regulation. Lowering the water table without exposing new layers with easily decomposable material would have a limited effect on emission rates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Incubation experiments with acidic bog peat, using nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), synthetic iron monosulfide (FeS), and ground natural pyrite (FeS2), suggested that heterotrophic denitrification of nitrate and nitrite was a major potential source of N2O in the peat soil. Neither FeS nor FeS2 amendment affected N2O production and therefore high production potentials of N2O were not a result of interactions between N oxyanions and iron sulfides, such as chemolithoautotrophic pyrite oxidation.

AB Detailed, accurate information on soil temperature is crucial for understanding processes leading to solute leaching and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from managed peat soils, but few studies have attempted to study these processes in detail. Drained peat soils have different characteristics from pristine peat. Cultivated peat soils, in particular, have high mineral matter content in the plough layer, due to mineralisation of peat and, sometimes, addition of mineral material. This study examined the effect of mineral matter content on thermal conductivity (lambda) in partially frozen and unfrozen peat samples. Effect of change in temperature from -3 degrees C to - 10 degrees C on thermal conductivity was also estimated. Three existing models for estimating the thermal conductivity of organic soils were assessed for their suitability for cultivated drained peat soils. The thermal conductivity of peat samples with three different levels of mineral matter content was determined, using the single probe method, in the saturated state and when subjected to at least two different matric potentials at five different temperatures ( + 10 degrees C, + 1 degrees C, - 3 degrees C, - 5 degrees C and -10 degrees C). The results showed that X values differed between peat soils depending on mineral matter content, ice content and moisture content. The samples with the highest mineral matter content and bulk density had higher thermal conductivity at positive temperatures and to a lesser extent, at freezing temperatures, when volumetric water content and volume of water-free pores was similar. Most soil samples, especially those with no added mineral soil, were not fully frozen at - 3 degrees C and - 5 degrees C, but this had minor effect on thermal conductivity compared with values measured at -10 degrees C. The Brovka-Rovdan model proved reasonably good at predicting frozen thermal conductivity in sand-enriched peat soils, while the de Vries model proved best at estimating thermal conductivity for unfrozen peat samples. We provide a first estimate of the thermal conductivity of (partially) frozen cultivated peat measured using undisturbed samples. These results can be used to parameterise numerical heat transport models for simulating soil processes and GHG emissions.

AB Denitrification is well known being the most important nitrate-consuming process in water-logged peat soils, whereby the intermediate compound nitrous oxide (N2O) and the end product dinitrogen (N-2) are ultimately released. The present study was aimed at evaluating the release of these gases (due to denitrification) from a nutrient-poor transition bog ecosystem under drained and three differently rewetted conditions at the field scale using a N-15-tracer approach ([N-15]nitrate application, 30 kg N ha(-1)) and a common closed-chamber technique. The drained site is characterized by a constant water table (WT) of -30 cm (here referred to as D30), while rewetted sites represent a constant WT of -15 cm, a constant WT of 0 cm (i.e. waterlogged), and an initial WT of 0 cm (which decreased slightly during the experiment), respectively, (here referred to as R15, R0, and R0(d), respectively). The highest N2O emissions were observed at D30 (291 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)) as well as at R0(d) (665 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)). At the rewetted peat sites with a constant WT (i.e. R15 and R0), considerably lower N2O emissions were observed (maximal 37 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)). Concerning N-2 only at the initially water-logged peat site R0(d) considerable release rates (up to 3110 mu g N-2-N m(-2) h(-1)) were observed, while under drained conditions (D30) no N-2 emission and under rewetted conditions with a constant WT (R15 and R0) significantly lower N-2 release rates (maximal 668 mu g N-2-N m(-2) h(-1)) could be detected. In addition, it has been found that natural WT fluctuations at rewetted peat sites, in particular a rapid drop down of the WT, can induce high emission rates for both N2O and N-2.

AB Salinity gradients across estuaries influence wetland carbon storage, methane (CH4) biogeochemistry, and plant productivity. Estuarine freshwater wetlands may experience increases in salinity during drought; however, the impact of salinization on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is uncertain. We measured ecosystem-scale GHG emissions from a wetland experiencing salinization during the 2011-2017 California drought and used information theory analyses to quantify couplings and causal interactions between CH4 fluxes and two dominant environmental drivers; gross ecosystem photosynthesis and temperature. Machine learning models were then used to estimate salinization-induced changes in CH4 fluxes and plant productivity. We observed dynamic CH4 flux-driver relationships across the salinization disturbance event, where temperature connections strengthened, and productivity connections dampened during salinization. Annual gross ecosystem productivity reduced by 64% during peak salinization, whereas annual CH4 emissions only reduced by 10%, suggesting that other CH4 substrate sources compensated for reductions in recent photosynthate. Our results demonstrate the value of applying information theory and machine learning approaches to ecological analyses and suggest that drought-induced salinization may increase GHG emissions from estuarine freshwater wetlands.

AB The growing demand for agricultural products has been leading to an expansion and intensification of agriculture around the world. More and more unused land is currently reclaimed in the regions of the former Soviet Union. Driven by climate change, the Western Siberian grain belt might, in a long-term, even expand into the drained peatland areas to the North. It is crucial to study the consequences of this land-use change with respect to the carbon cycling as this is still a major knowledge gap.
   We present for the first time data on the atmosphere-ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide and methane of an arable field and a neighboring unused grassland on peat soil in Western Siberia. Eddy covariance measurements were performed over one vegetation period. No directed methane fluxes were found due to an effective drainage of the study sites. The carbon dioxide fluxes appeared to be of high relevance for the global carbon and greenhouse gas cycles. They showed very site-specific patterns resulting from the development of vegetation: the persistent plants of the grassland were able to start photosynthesizing soon after snow melt, while the absence of vegetation on the managed field lead to a phase of emissions until the oat plants started to grow in June. The uptake peak of the oat field is much later than that of the grassland, but larger due to a rapid plant growth. Budgeting the whole measurement period, the grassland served as a carbon sink, whereas the oat field was identified to be a carbon source. The conversion from non-used grasslands on peat soil to cultivated fields in Western Siberia is therefore considered to have a positive feedback on climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O were measured during two to three years at four sites, located within an area of 9 km](2) in southern Sweden, using dark static chamber techniques. Three of the sites were drained coniferous forests on moist organic soils that differed in forest productivity and tree species. The fourth site was an undrained tall sedge mire. Although the drained sites were all moist, with average groundwater levels between 17 and 27 cm below the soil surface, the mean annual dark forest floor CO2 release rate was significantly higher at the drained sites, (0.9-1.9 kg m(-2) y(-1)) than at the undrained mire site (0.8 to 1.2 kg m(-2) y(-1)). CH4 emissions were significantly lower from the drained sites than from the undrained mire (0.0 to 1.6 g m(-2) y(-1), compared to 10.6 to 12.2 g m(-2) y(-1)), while NO emissions were significantly lower from the undrained site than from the drained sites (20 to 30 mg m(-2) y(-1), compared to 30 to 90 mg m(-2) y(-1)). There were no clear effects of site productivity or tree species on the soil fluxes of any of the gases. The annual pet primary production of the forests was modeled. All drained sites were net sinks, while the undrained mire was a net source of greenhouse gases. The estimated net greenhouse gas exchange of the drained sites was correlated with productivity: the most productive site was the largest net sink and the least productive the smallest net sink for greenhouse gases. The results indicate that, to mitigate the increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases, drained forest sites, which have been unsuccessfully drained or rewetted due to subsidence, should be managed in a way that keeps the groundwater level at a steady state.

AB Rich fens are common boreal ecosystems with distinct hydrology, biogeochemistry and ecology that influence their carbon (C) balance. We present growing season soil chamber methane emission (F-CH4), ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary production (GPP) fluxes from a 9-years water table manipulation experiment in an Alaskan rich fen. The study included major flood and drought years, where wetting and drying treatments further modified the severity of droughts. Results support previous findings from peatlands that drought causes reduced magnitude of growing season F-CH4, GPP and NEE, thus reducing or reversing their C sink function. Experimentally exacerbated droughts further reduced the capacity for the fen to act as a C sink by causing shifts in vegetation and thus reducing magnitude of maximum growing season GPP in subsequent flood years by similar to 15% compared to control plots. Conversely, water table position had only a weak influence on ER, but dominant contribution to ER switched from autotrophic respiration in wet years to heterotrophic in dry years. Droughts did not cause interannual lag effects on ER in this rich fen, as has been observed in several nutrient-poor peatlands. While ER was dependent on soil temperatures at 2 cm depth, F-CH4 was linked to soil temperatures at 25 cm. Inter-annual variability of deep soil temperatures was in turn dependent on wetness rather than air temperature, and higher F-CH4 in flooded years was thus equally due to increased methane production at depth and decreased methane oxidation near the surface. Short-term fluctuations in wetness caused significant lag effects on F-CH4, but droughts caused no inter-annual lag effects on F-CH4. Our results show that frequency and severity of droughts and floods can have characteristic effects on the exchange of greenhouse gases, and emphasize the need to project future hydrological regimes in rich fens.

AB Drained organic soils are considered to be hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Arable lands and intensively used grasslands, in particular, have been regarded as the main producers of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). However, GHG balances of former peatlands and associated organic soils not considered to be peatland according to the definition of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have not been investigated so far. Therefore, our study addressed the question to what extent the soil organic carbon (SOC) content affects the GHG release of drained organic soils under two different landuse types (arable land and intensively used grassland). Both land-use types were established on a Mollic Gleysol (labeled C-medium) as well as on a Sapric Histosol (labeled C-high). The two soil types differed significantly in their SOC contents in the topsoil (C-medium: 9.4-10.9% SOC; Chigh: 16.117.2% SOC). We determined GHG fluxes over a period of 1 or 2 years in case of N2O or methane (CH4) and CO2, respectively. The daily and annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 was determined by measuring NEE and the ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) with the closed dynamic chamber technique and by modeling the R-ECO and the gross primary production (GPP). N2O and CH4 were measured with the static closed chamber technique. Estimated NEE of CO2 differed significantly between the two land-use types, with lower NEE values (6 to 1707 g CO2-Cm-2 yr(-1)) at the arable sites and higher values (1354 to 1823 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)) at the grassland sites. No effect on NEE was found regarding the SOC content. Significantly higher annual N2O exchange rates were observed at the arable sites (0.23-0.86 g Nm(-2) yr(-1)) than at the grassland sites (0.12-0.31 g Nm(-2) yr(-1)). Furthermore, N2O fluxes from the Chigh sites significantly exceeded those of the C-medium sites. CH4 fluxes were found to be close to zero at all plots. Estimated global warming potential, calculated for a time horizon of 100 years (GWP(100)) revealed a very high release of GHGs from all plots ranging from 1837 to 7095 g CO2 (eq). m(-2) yr(-1). Calculated global warming potential (GWP) values did not differ between soil types and partly exceeded the IPCC default emission factors of the Tier 1 approach by far. However, despite being subject to high uncertainties, the results clearly highlight the importance of adjusting the IPCC guidelines for organic soils not falling under the definition in order to avoid a significant underestimation of GHG emissions in the corresponding sectors of the national climate reporting. Furthermore, the present results revealed that mainly the type of land-use, including the management type, and not the SOC content is responsible for the height of GHG exchange from intensive farming on drained organic soils.

AB Environmental and economic performance of forestry on drained peatlands was reviewed to consider whether continuous cover forestry (CCF) could be a feasible alternative to even-aged management (EM). CCF was regarded feasible particularly because continuously maintaining a tree stand with significant transpiration and interception capacity would decrease the need for ditch network maintenance. Managing CCF forests in such a way that the ground water levels are lower than in clear-cut EM forests but higher than in mature EM forests could decrease greenhouse gas emissions and negative water quality impacts caused both by anoxic redox reactions and oxidation and mineralization of deep peat layers. Regeneration studies indicated potential for satisfactory natural regeneration under CCF on drained peatlands. An economic advantage in CCF over EM is that fewer investments are needed to establish the forest stand and sustain its growth. Thus, even if the growth of trees in CCF forests were lower than in EM forests, CCF could at least in some peatland sites turn out to be a more profitable forest management regime. An advantage of CCF from the viewpoint of socially optimal forest management is that it plausibly reduces the negative externalities of management compared to EM. We propose that future research in drained peatland forests should focus on assessing the economic and environmental feasibility of CCF.

AB A model framework for national greenhouse gas emission and removal estimation for Canadian peatlands (CaMP v2.0) was developed and tested. It provides a module that can work alongside the upland forest Generic Carbon Budget Model (GCBM) developed to eventually replace the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3) as the core model in Canada's National Forest Carbon Monitoring, Accounting and Reporting System. The CaMP (v2.0) provides a simple model foundation that can be applied nationally for 11 different peatland categories. It tracks the growth, turnover and decay in annual time steps of different vegetation components (foliage, branches, stems, and roots of trees, shrubs, sedges and mosses). It uses a Q(10) relationship to model peat C pool decomposition as a function of mean annual temperature, and models methane flux response to deviations in annual water table depth. The CaMP takes a simple approach to modeling hydrology for large spatial scales by using the nationally-available Canadian Fire Weather Index Drought Code to predict long-term and annual water table depth. The CaMP (v2.0) provides the framework needed to model disturbances but only includes wildfire in this version. Model behavior and sensitivity were assessed, and evaluated against observed flux data. Results suggest that the CaMP (v2.0) provides an appropriate structure for large spatial- and temporal-scale estimation of emissions, owing to the model behaving as expected relative to shifts in environmental variables, and to reasonably small mean observed to modeled residuals. Methane was overestimated by the model on average by 6 g C ha(-1) y(-1) (n = 53 years of data across 11 peatland sites), and by 8 g C ha(-1) y(-1) when weighted by site location (n = 12 sites, >= 3 years of data per site). The model overestimated net ecosystem exchange (NEE) by 20 g C ha(-1) y(-1) (n = 36 years of data across 12 peatland sites), and by 2 g C ha(-1) y(-1) when weighted by site location (n = 11 sites, >= 3 years of data per site), and results demonstrate that inter-site variation is greater than temporal variation across NEE measures. Several aspects were identified as requiring further work to increase explained variation in finer-scale emission estimates. Recommendations include further expanding the existing peatland databases to re-calibrate peat decomposition rates and better parameterize NPP rates by region for certain vegetation layers and peatland types, as well as developing a national annual-scale soil temperature model that could serve to replace the air temperature (Q(10)) decay relationship currently used in the CaMP (v2.0). Data gaps that were identified include the need for annualized methane flux datasets with appropriate annual-scale meta-data. Future work is required to include permafrost dynamics, as well as additional natural, and anthropogenic disturbances.

AB To date there is still a lack of reliable data on greenhouse gas emissions from drained fens needed to determine the climatic relevance of land use and land use change on peatlands and to supply the National Inventory Report for the German Greenhouse Gas Inventory. In this study we present the results of monthly-based multiyear measurements of CO2, N2O and CH4 flux rates in two drained agriculturally used fen ecosystems in NW Germany (cropland and grassland) over a period of 4.5 y using transparent and opaque closed chambers. CO2 exchange was modelled at high resolution with temperature and photosynthetic active radiation. The measured and modelled values fit very well (R-2 >= 0.93). Annual GHG and Global Warming Potential (GWP) balances were determined. Net CO2 emissions at the cropland and grassland sites were similarly high, taking into account changes in management; net ecosystem C balance amounted to about 4.0 to 5.0 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1). Emissions of N2O and CH4 were low at both sites. The mean GWP balance for a time frame of 100 y (GWP100) amounted to about 17.0 to 19.0 Mg CO2-eq. ha(-1) y(-1). The unexpectedly low greenhouse gas emissions from the cropland site are attributed to the high water table and a change in crop management. The change from corn for silage to corn-cob mix lead transiently to rather small greenhouse gas emissions. The study confirms the need for multiyear measurements taking climatic and management variation into account.

AB We studied the impact of reed canary grass (RCG) cultivation on greenhouse gas emission in the following sites of an abandoned peat extraction area in Estonia: a bare soil (BS) site, a nonfertilized Phalaris (nfP) plot, a fertilized Phalaris (fP) plot, and a natural bog (NB) and a fen meadow (FM) as reference areas. The C balance and global warming potential (GWP) were estimated by measuring CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions and aboveground and belowground biomass variations. The high CO2 flux from the nfP and fP sites and the low CO2 emission from the BS are due to the enhancement of mineralization by plant growth on planted sites and inhibited mineralization by the recalcitrant C of BS. The NB site emitted 24 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1), whereas the almost zero CH4 emission from the Phalaris plots and the BS site was due to the high S concentration in peat, which probably inhibited methanogenesis. The N2O flux varied from <0.1 kg on the Phalaris plots and the NB to 2.64 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1) on the FM. The highest yield of RCG was obtained in autumn (13.9 t and 8.0 t dw ha(-1) on the fP and nfP, respectively). By spring, the biomass yield on the fP and nfP plot was 12.7 and 7.9 t dw ha(-1), respectively. The C balance of nfP and fP plots was negative in comparison to the BS (-3322, -5983, and 2504 kg CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). This indicates that the cultivation of RCG transformed them from a net source of C into a net sink of C. The GWP for the fP and nfP sites was -5981 and -3885 kg CO2 eq ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The BS site had a total GWP of 2544 kg CO2 eq ha(-1) yr(-1).

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O), a major greenhouse gas and ozone depleter, is emitted from drained organic soils typically developed in floodplains. We investigated the effect of the water table depth and soil oxygen (O-2) content on N2O fluxes and their nitrogen isotope composition in a drained floodplain fen in Estonia. Measurements were done at natural water table depth, and we created a temporary anoxic environment by experimental flooding. From the suboxic peat (0.5-6 mg O-2/L) N2O emissions peaked at 6 mg O-2/L and afterwards decreased with decreasing O-2. From the anoxic and oxic peat (0 and >6 mg O-2/L, respectively) N2O emissions were low. Under anoxic conditions the delta N-15/delta N-14 ratio of the top 10 cm peat layer was low, gradually decreasing to 30 cm. In the suboxic peat, delta N-15/delta N-14 ratios increased with depth. In samples of peat fluctuating between suboxic and anoxic, the elevated N-15/N-14 ratios (delta N-15 = 7-9 parts per thousand. ambient N-2) indicated intensive microbial processing of nitrogen. Low values of site preference (SP; difference between the central and peripheral N-15 atoms) and delta O-18-N2O in the captured gas samples indicate nitrifier denitrification in the floodplain fen.

AB Acetylene, dimethyl ether (DME) and 2-chloro-6-trichloromethyl pyridine (nitrapyrin) were used as inhibitors to study the contributions of nitrification and denitrification to the production of N2O and nitric oxide (NO) in samples taken from the soil profile of a peatland drained for forestry. Acetylene and DME inhibited 60-100% of the nitrification activity in field-moist samples from the 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm peat layers, whereas nitrapyrin had no inhibitory effect. In the 0-5 cm peat layer the N2O production could be reduced by up to 90% with inhibitors of nitrification, but in the 5-10 cm peat layer this proportion was 20-30%. All the inhibitors removed 96-100% of the nitrification potential in peat-water slurries from the 0-5 cm peat layer, but the 5-10 cm layer had a much lower nitrification activity, and here the efficiency of the inhibitors was more variable. Litter was the main net source of NO in the peat profile. NO3- production was lower in the litter layer than in the peat, whereas N2O production was much higher in the litter than in the peat. Denitrification was the most probable source of N2O and NO in the litter, which had a high availability of organic substrates.

AB Receding permafrost may expose the largest store of sequestered carbon to microbes ready to convert it to greenhouse gases. The fluxes of biogenic gases associated with boreal wetlands have historically been difficult to measure, limiting our understanding of what may happen as permafrost thaws. The many difficulties in working in high-latitude climates have dramatically limited our understanding on the spatial and temporal distribution of fluxes and what is likely to change with a warming climate. The use of the eddy covariance approach to measure methane emissions has been developing steadily over the past 26years. Taylor et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JG004444) is an excellent example of the advancements made in the field. Here I summarize the history of the eddy covariance methane literature, describe advancements in spatial and temporal coverage, and look at important drivers of methane emissions.

AB The generally-accepted paradigm of wetland response to dimate change is that water table drawdown and higher temperatures will cause wetlands to switch from a sink to a source of atmospheric carbon. However, it is hard to find a multi-year, ecosystem scale dataset representative of an undisturbed wetland that clearly demonstrates this paradigm on an annual total basis. Here we provide strong empirical confirmation of the above scenario based on six years of continuous eddy-covariance CO2 and CH4 flux measurements in Biebrza Valley, north-eastern Poland. In wet years the mire was a significant sink of atmospheric carbon (down to -270 +/- 70 gC-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) against +21.8 +/- 3.4 gC-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2013) whereas in dry years it constituted a sub- stantial carbon source (releasing up to +130 +/- 70 gC-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) and +2.6 +/- 1.4 gC-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015). Our findings demonstrate that the scenario of positive feedback between wetland carbon release and the present climate change trajectory is realistic and support the need of natural wetland preservation or rewetting. Our findings also indicate that conclusions drawn regarding a wetland's response to changing climate can depend strongly on the chosen period of analysis. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The carbon (C) balance of boreal peatlands is mainly the sum of three different C fluxes: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). lntra- and inter-annual dynamics of these fluxes are differentially controlled by similar factors, such as temperature and water-table. Different climatic conditions within and between years might thus result in varying absolute and relative contributions of each flux to net ecosystem productivity (NEP). In this study CO2 fluxes were measured at a boreal peatland in eastern Finland during a dry year (2006) and a wet year (2007) and combined with DOC and CH4 fluxes from the same site. CO2 uptake in the wet year was 65% higher than in the dry year, caused by higher water table (WT) and subsequently reduced rates of soil respiration. Two to three-fold increases in DOC and CH4 fluxes in the wet year did not completely offset the higher CO2 uptake in that year, resulting in NEP of -83.7 +/- 14 g C M-2 in the dry and 134.5 +/- 21 g C 111(-2) in the wet year. Thus, in our study, WT was identified as the most important factor responsible for variations in the C balance between the observed years. (C) 2013 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

AB Fluxes of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) estimated by empirical models based on small-scale chamber measurements were compared to large-scale eddy covariance (EC) measurements for CH4 and to a combination of EC measurements and EC-based models for CO2. The experimental area was a flat peat meadow in the Netherlands with heterogeneous source strengths for both greenhouse gases. Two scenarios were used to assess the importance of stratifying the landscape into landscape elements before up-scaling the fluxes measured by chambers to landscape scale: one took the main landscape elements into account (field, ditch edge ditch), the other took only the field into account. Non-linear regression models were used to up-scale the chamber measurements to field emission estimates. EC CO2 respiration consisted of measured night time EC fluxes and modeled day time fluxes using the Arrhenius model. EC CH4 flux estimate was based on daily averages and the remaining data gaps were filled by linear interpolation. The EC and chamber-based estimates agreed well when the three landscape elements were taken into account with 16.5% and 13.0% difference for CO2 respiration and CH4, respectively. However, both methods differed 31.0% and 55.1% for CO2 respiration and CH4 when only field emissions were taken into account when up-scaling chamber measurements to landscape scale. This emphasizes the importance of stratifying the landscape into landscape elements. The conclusion is that small-scale chamber measurements can be used to estimate fluxes of CO2 and CH4 at landscape scale if fluxes are scaled by different landscape elements. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB The aim of this study is to estimate wintertime emissions of greenhouse gases CO2, N2O and CH(4)in two abandoned peat extraction areas (APEA), Ess-soo and Laiuse, and in two Oxalis site-type drained peatland forests (DPF) on nitrogen-rich sapric histosol, a Norway spruce and a Downy birch forest, located in eastern Estonia. According to the long-term study using a closed chamber method, the APEAs emitted less CO(2)and N2O, and more CH(4)than the DPFs. Across the study sites, CO(2)flux correlated positively with soil, ground and air temperatures. Continuous snow depth > 5 cm did not influence CO2, but at no snow or a thin snow layer the fluxes varied on a large scale (from -1.1 to 106 mg C m(-2)h(-1)). In all sites, the highest N2O fluxes were observed at a water table depth of -30 to -40 cm. CH(4)was consumed in the DPFs and was always emitted from the APEAs, whereas the highest flux appeared at a water table >20 cm above the surface. Considering the global warming potential (GWP) of the greenhouse gas emissions from the DPFs in the wintertime, the flux of N2O was the main component of warming, showing 3-6 times higher radiative forcing values than that of CO(2)flux, while the role of CH(4)was unimportant. In the APEAs, CO(2)and CH(4)made up almost equal parts, whereas the impact of N2O on GWP was minor.

AB In the boreal zone, large areas of natural mires have been drained and used for agriculture, resulting in net carbon dioxide (CO,) emissions and increased nitrous oxide emissions but decreased methane emissions. However, due to structural changes in agriculture, a substantial area of cropland on organic soil has been afforested. In order to estimate the carbon balance of afforested organic-soil cropland, we measured CO, and water vapour (H 20) fluxes during year above a Scots pine plantation (Pinus sylvestris) in the middle-boreal zone, using the micrometeorological eddy covariance method. We observed CO2 uptake by the Scots pine stand from late April to mid-October with a daily average net uptake from May to the beginning of October. However, there were also periods of daily net efflux. High ecosystem respiration rates continued throughout the winter (mean winter respiration 0.036 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). As an annual average, the 30-year-old pine stand was a small source of CO2 (+50 g m(-2) a(-1)) to the atmosphere, showing that the CO2 sequestration into the ecosystem was able to compensate for most of the carbon that was released by heterotrophic respiration from the drained soil.

AB Drained organic soils are anthropogenic emission hotspots of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Most studies have focused on deep peat soils and on peats with high organic carbon content. In contrast, histic Gleysols are characterized by shallow peat layers, which are left over from peat cutting activities or by peat mixed with mineral soil. It is unknown whether they emit less GHGs than deep Histosols when drained. We present the annual carbon and GHG balance of grasslands for six sites on nutrient-poor histic Gleysols with a shallow (30 cm) histic horizon or mixed with mineral soil in Northern Germany (soil organic carbon concentration (C-org)from 9 to 52%).
   The net GHG balance, corrected for carbon export by harvest, was around 4 t CO2-C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) on soils with peat layer and little drainage (mean annual water table < 20 cm below surface). The net GHG balance reached 7- 9 t CO2-C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) on soils with sand mixed into the peat layer and water tables between 14 cm and 39 cm below surface. GHG emissions from drained histic Gleysols (i)wereas high as those from deep Histosols, (ii) increase linearly from shallow to deeper drainage, (iii) but are not affected by C-org content of the histic horizon. Ecosystem respiration (R-eco) was linearly correlated with water table level even if it was below the histic horizon. The R-eco/GPP ratio was 1.5 at all sites, so that we ruled out a major influence of the inter-site variability in vegetation composition on annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE).
   The IPCC definition of organic soils includes shallow histic topsoil, unlike most national and international definitions of Histosols. Our study confirms that this broader definition is appropriate considering anthropogenic GHG emissions from drained organic soils. Countries currently apply soil maps in national GHG inventories which are likely not to include histic Gleysols. The land area with GHG emission hotspots due to drainage is likely to be much higher than anticipated.
   Deeply drained histic Gleysols are GHG hotspots that have so far been neglected or underestimated. Peat mixing with sand does not mitigate GHG emissions. Our study implies that rewetting organic soils, including histic Gleysols, has a much higher relevance for GHG mitigation strategies than currently recognized.

AB Calluna vulgaris can and does grow in areas considered unsuitable for production of biomass crops. In the UK, Calluna vegetation is regularly controlled by burn management and if instead the lost biomass could be harvested would it represent a viable energy crop? This study used established techniques for other energy crops to assess the energy yield, energy efficiency and the greenhouse gas savings represented by cropping of Calluna under two scenarios; only harvested on the area currently under burn management; and harvested on the present total area of Calluna in the UK. The study can consider biomass potential across the UK and can include altitude changes. The study can show that Calluna would represent an efficient energy crop in areas where it would not be possible to revert to functioning peat bogs. The energy efficiency was 65 +/- 19 GJ(output) GJ(input)(-1) with GHG savings of up to 11 tonnes CO2eq, ha(-1) yr(-1). When considered across the UK the potential energy production was up to 40.7 PJ yr(-1) and the potential greenhouse gas saving was upto -2061 ktonnes CO2eq yr(-1) if the all Calluna could be brought into production and substituted for coal.

AB Nutrient-poor organic soils under maritime grassland are often located in remote wet locations in the landscape. Leaving these soils without drainage maintenance often raise the water table but continuous management (grazing) means they could remain a source of carbon dioxide (CO2) while also turning into a small source of methane (CH4). Due to geographical and socio-economic reasons, removing these sites from agricultural production may be an option to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To test this hypothesis we measured GHG fluxes over a four year period, at a drained and a rewetted organic soil under grassland, which were both grazed for the first two years and not grazed for the following two years. Statistical response functions estimated for gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) were used to reconstruct annual CO2-C balances using site-specific models driven by soil temperature, solar radiation, soil water table (WT) and leaf area index (LAI). Annually, soil CO2 emissions were comparable when grazed, although the rewetted site had a lower net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) despite displaying higher CH4 emissions. Both sites have lower CO2 emissions than typical drained organic soils due to management practices: extensive grazing, no fertilisation and mean annual water tables above-25 cm. When grazing stopped, GPP and Reco increased dramatically driven by vigorous growth of vegetation at both sites. The shallow drained site remained a source of CO2 and small source of CH4 while the rewetted site became either neutral or a small sink of CO2 with decreased CH4 emissions compared to the grazing period. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were negligible at either site. Removing grazing significantly reduced the NECB at both sites but in terms of global warming potential (GWP), the greatest GHG mitigation was in the rewetted site which exerted a cooling effect in the second year after the management shift.

AB Agricultural production contributes 11% to the total German greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We compare the efficiency of three different land use based GHG abatement measures in combination and as separately applied measures: the production of short rotation coppices, of feedstocks for biomethane production, and peatland restoration. We evaluate these options with respect to the following criteria: cost efficiency (GHG abatement costs), abatement potential, and impact on agricultural production. We use the regional supply model RAUMIS to investigate the different abatement measures at the sector and regional level. Up to a reduction of GHG emission of 25 * 10(12) g CO2eq peatland restoration is the most cost efficient option. Short rotation coppice allow some cost-efficient mitigation also only at limited scale. Energy maize is only an option if high abatement targets should be met. The joint implementation of several abatement strategies allows meeting specified targets at lower costs. The crowding out effect between the options is limited. The spatial analysis indicates measure specific regional competitiveness and application e.g. short rotation coppice in Eastern and Southern Germany, peat restoration in Northern Germany and energy maize production in central Germany.

AB Rotation forestry including clearcutting is a common method of practising forestry in Fennoscandia. Clearcutting in peatland forests markedly increases environmental loading: leaching of nutrients and methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from soil. Continuous cover forestry has been suggested as an alternative because it does not include clearcutting but partial harvesting. However, impacts of partial harvesting on greenhouse gas fluxes are not well understood and in peatlands have not been studied at all. We conducted a partial harvest by removing 70% of the total stem volume in a mature nutrient-rich peatland forest in Southern Finland. The aim was to investigate how partial harvesting a peatland forest affects CH4 and N2O balances, and how much different surface types contribute to the balances. We used automatic and manual chamber methods to measure fluxes from both harvest and uncut control site. Fluxes were measured from the forest floor, logging trails, and ditches. Fluxes from these surface types were upscaled to obtain net ecosystem-level fluxes during two postharvest summers (June-August 2016 and 2017). After the harvest, forest floor CH4 fluxes did not change significantly at the harvested site compared to the control site. However, fluxes at logging trails increased significantly. N2O fluxes increased at the harvest site in the post-harvest years, but so did those at the control site as well. Upscaling CH4 fluxes to ecosystem-level indicated that despite their small area (2.4%), emissions from ditches could be large on ecosystem-scale, but their uncertainty was high, while the logging trail CH4 fluxes (20% of the total area) were small. In contrast, N2O fluxes from ditches were low, but the logging trail fluxes comprised 35-38% of the total surface balance. The overall conclusion is that partial harvesting did not cause considerable changes in CH4 and N2O fluxes from a forestry-drained peatland.

AB Climate change mitigation is a global response that requires actions at the local level. Quantifying local sources and sinks of greenhouse gases (GHG) facilitate evaluating mitigation options. We present an approach to collate spatially explicit estimated fluxes of GHGs (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) for main land use sectors in the landscape, to aggregate, and to calculate the net emissions of an entire region. Our procedure was developed and tested in a large river basin in Finland, providing information from intensively studied eLTER research sites. To evaluate the full GHG balance, fluxes from natural ecosystems (lakes, rivers, and undrained mires) were included together with fluxes from anthropogenic activities, agriculture and forestry. We quantified the fluxes based on calculations with an anthropogenic emissions model (FRES) and a forest growth and carbon balance model (PREBAS), as well as on emission coefficients from the literature regarding emissions from lakes, rivers, undrained mires, peat extraction sites and cropland. Spatial data sources included CORINE land use data, soil map, lake and river shorelines, national forest inventory data, and statistical data on anthropogenic activities. Emission uncertainties were evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations. Artificial surfaces were the most emission intensive land-cover class. Lakes and rivers were about as emission intensive as arable land. Forests were the dominant land cover in the region (66%), and the C sink of the forests decreased the total emissions of the region by 72%. The region's net emissions amounted to 4.37 +/- 1.43 Tg CO2-eq yr(-1), corresponding to a net emission intensity 0.16 Gg CO2-eq km(-2) yr(-1), and estimated per capita net emissions of 5.6 Mg CO2-eq yr(-1). Our landscape approach opens opportunities to examine the sensitivities of important GHG fluxes to changes in land use and climate, management actions, and mitigation of anthropogenic emissions.

AB We monitored CO2 and CH4 fluxes using eddy covariance from 19 May to 27 September 2011 in a poor fen located in northern Michigan. The objectives of this paper are to: (1) quantify the flux of CH4 from a sub-boreal peatland, and (2) determine which abiotic and biotic factors were the most correlated to the flux of CH4 over the measurement period. Net daily CH4 fluxes increased from 70 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) to 220 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) from mid May to mid July. After July, CH4 losses steadily declined to approximately 50 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) in late September. During the study period, the peatland lost 17.4 gCH(4) m(-2). Both abiotic and biotic variables were correlated with CH4 fluxes. When the different variables were analyzed together, the preferred model included mean daily soil temperature at 20 cm, daily net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and the interaction between mean daily soil temperature at 20 cm and NEE (R-2 = 0.47, p value < 0.001). The interaction was important because the relationship between daily NEE and mean daily soil temperature with CH4 flux changed when NEE was negative (CO2 uptake from the atmosphere) or positive (CO2 losses to the atmosphere). On days when daily NEE was negative, 25% of the CH4 flux could be explained by correlations with NEE, however on days when daily NEE was positive, there was no correlation between daily NEE and the CH4 flux. In contrast, daily mean soil temperature at 20 cm was poorly correlated to changes in CH4 when NEE was negative (17%), but the correlation increased to 34% when NEE was positive. The interaction between daily NEE and mean daily soil temperature at 20 cm indicates shifting environmental controls on the CH4 flux throughout the growing season.

AB The annual carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) dynamics were measured with static chambers on two organic agricultural soils with different soil characteristics. Site I had a peat layer of 30 cm, with an organic matter (OM) content of 74% in the top 20 cm. Site 2 had a peat layer of 70 cm but an OM content of only 40% in the top 20 cm. On both sites there were plots under barley and grass and also plots where the vegetation was removed. All soils were net sources of CO2 and N2O, but they consumed atmospheric CH4. Soils under barley had higher net CO2 emissions (830 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)) and N2O emissions (848 mg N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1)) than those under grass (395 g CO2-C m(-3) yr(-1) and 275 mg N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1)). Bare soils had the highest N2O emissions, mean 2350 mg N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1). The mean CH4 uptake rate from vegetated soils was 100 mg CH4-C m(-3) yr(-1) and from bare soils 55 mg CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1). The net CO2 emissions were higher from Site 2, which had a high peat bulk density and a low OM content derived from the addition of mineral soil to the peat during the cultivation history of that site. Despite the differences in soil characteristics, the mean N2O emissions were similar from vegetated peat soils from both sites. However, bare soils from Site 2 with mineral soil addition had N2O emissions of 2-9 times greater than those from Site 1. Site 1 consumed atmospheric CH4 at a higher rate than Site 2 with additional mineral soil. N2O emissions during winter were an important component of the N2O budget even though they varied greatly, ranging from 2 to 99% (mean 26%) of the annual emission. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ecosystem services have become an important concept in policy-making. Carbon (C) sequestration into ecosystems is a significant ecosystem service, whereas C losses can be considered as an ecosystem disservice. Municipalities are in a position to make decisions that affect local emissions and therefore are important when considering greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. Integrated estimations of fluxes at a regional level help local authorities to develop land use policies for minimising GHG emissions and maximising C sinks. In this study, the Finnish national GHG accounting system is modified and applied at the municipal level by combining emissions and sinks from agricultural land, forest areas, water bodies and mires (land use-related GHG emissions) with emissions from activities such as energy production and traffic (anthropogenic GHG emissions) into the LUONNIKAS calculation tool. The study area consists of 14 municipalities within the Vanajavesi catchment area located in Southern Finland. In these municipalities, croplands, peat extraction sites, water bodies and undrained mires are emission sources, whereas forests are large carbon sinks that turn the land use-related GHG budget negative, resulting in C sequestration into the ecosystem. The annual land use-related sink in the study area was 78 t CO2 eq km(-2) and 2.8 t CO2 eq per capita. Annual anthropogenic GHG emissions from the area amounted to 250 t CO2 eq km(-2) and 9.2 t CO2 eq per capita. Since forests are a significant carbon sink and the efficiency of this sink is heavily affected by forest management practices, forest management policy is a key contributing factor for mitigating municipal GHG emissions.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions (E-N2O) from drained peat soils used for pastoral agriculture have not been measured throughout the year in New Zealand. In response to this research gap, E-N2O was measured fortnightly for 1 year in the Waikato region in a plot that was not grazed or nitrogen (N) fertilised. The time series was variable, the frequency distribution skewed and the fortnightly means correlated. To account for these factors, the data were log(e) transformed and an order 2 autoregressive model used to estimate a mean E-N2O of 4.3gNha(-1)d(-1) and 95% confidence limits of 0.6-29.1gNha(-1)d(-1). There was a statistically significant, inverse relationship between E-N2O and the depth to groundwater. In winter, when rainfall totalled 393mm, E-N2O and soil N content were significantly greater under a rain shelter designed to minimise N loss by leaching, than in an uncovered plot.

AB Restoring degraded peat soils presents an attractive, but largely untested, climate change mitigation approach. Drained peat soils used for agriculture can be large greenhouse gas sources. By restoring subsided peat soils to managed, impounded wetlands, significant agricultural emissions are avoided, and soil carbon can be sequestered and protected. Here, we synthesize 36 site-years of continuous carbon dioxide and methane flux data from a mesonetwork of eddy covariance towers in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California, USA to compute carbon and greenhouse gas budgets for drained agricultural land uses and compare these to restored deltaic wetlands. We found that restored wetlands effectively sequestered carbon and halted soil carbon loss associated with drained agricultural land uses. Depending on the age and disturbance regime of the restored wetland, many land use conversions from agriculture to restored wetland resulted in emission reductions over a 100-year timescale. With a simple model of radiative forcing and atmospheric lifetimes, we showed that restored wetlands do not begin to accrue greenhouse gas benefits until nearly a half century, and become net sinks from the atmosphere after a century. Due to substantial interannual variability and uncertainty about the multi-decadal successional trajectory of managed, restored wetlands, ongoing ecosystem flux measurements are critical for understanding the long-term impacts of wetland restoration for climate change mitigation.

AB Cultivated organic soils can be a major source of GHG emissions in countries with high coverage of peat soils. Targeting mitigation measures based on mapping of cultivated organic soils would reduce these emissions and increase sustainability of agriculture. Different georeferenced datasets were combined to study the area trend and describe current agricultural use of organic soils. The area was also mapped regionally into classes based on intensity of cultivation and organic layer depth, and an example allocation of potential mitigation measures was made at the country scale. The area and proportion of cultivated organic soils have increased in Finland since 1990 but the clearance rate has decreased in recent years. More than half of the area retains a peat layer deeper than 0.6 m indicating long-lasting mitigation potential with measures capable of slowing peat decomposition. Sixty-five percent of the cultivated organic soil area was not considered a priority area for radical management changes, for various reasons, but there are 85,000ha of field with more realistic potential for GHG mitigation. The mapping method was found to be a practical tool for depicting the GHG mitigation potential of cultivated organic soils. Significant reductions in agricultural GHG emissions can be expected with implementation of the suggested mitigation measures.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) contributes substantially to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the agricultural and landuse sectors. Owing to the high effort needed for measuring N2O emissions and the resulting lack of sufficient field measurements to apply at country-wide scale, soil-borne N2O emissions are often estimated by applying published IPCC default emission factors. To examine the data reported in the national GHG inventory, the current study utilizes a large data set of soil C/N ratios to predict N2O emissions and their distribution from drained organic soils in Switzerland. Calculated emission rates increase in the order of forest < grassland < cropland, and they are similar to the mean values currently used in the inventory. Distributions of N2O emissions are highly positive-skewed and they reveal probabilities of 10 and 14% for cropland and grassland, respectively, to be above 20 kg of N2O-N per hectare and year. It is likely that the greater part of N2O from drained organic soil derives from N released upon peat decomposition, and not from fertilization. In conclusion, this research shows that measurement of soil C/N ratios improves the reliability of organic soil N2O emissions estimates on a national scale and identifies site conditions where future emission measurements would be most effective for reducing the uncertainty in the GHG inventory.

AB Global warming can substantially affect the export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from peatpermafrost to aquatic systems. The direct degradability of such peat-derived DOC, however, is poorly constrained because previous permafrost thaw studies have mainly addressed mineral soil catchments or DOC pools that have already been processed in surface waters. We incubated peat cores from a palsa mire to compare an active layer and an experimentally thawed permafrost layer with regard to DOC composition and degradation potentials of pore water DOC. Our results show that DOC from the thawed permafrost layer had high initial degradation potentials compared with DOC from the active layer. In fact, the DOC that showed the highest bio-and photo-degradability, respectively, originated in the thawed permafrost layer. Our study sheds new light on the DOC composition of peat-permafrost directly upon thaw and suggests that past estimates of carbon-dioxide emissions from thawed peat permafrost may be biased as they have overlooked the initial mineralization potential of the exported DOC.

AB Peat moss in drained peatlands has become a non-negligible source of greenhouse gases (GHG) emission. Pyrolysis is a potential technique to convert carbon-emitting peat moss to carbon-storage materials. This work investigates the behavior of peat moss pyrolysis by a combined in-situ thermal analysis and bench-scale pyrolysis experiment methodology. The simultaneous thermal analyzer, which provides the simultaneous TG/DTA analysis, was employed to reveal the thermal decomposition behavior of peat moss. The samples were heated up to 900 degrees C with different heating rates of 10, 15, and 20 degrees C/min. Thereafter, pyrolysis experiments with peak temperatures of 450, 500, 550 and 600 degrees C were performed in a bench-scale pyrolyzer. It was found that there are four main stages and two micro stages of mass loss during peat moss pyrolysis from room temperature to 900 degrees C. Also, kinetic parameters were calculated based on the results of TG and DTG by the Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) method and the Coats-Redfern (CR) method. In the bench-scale pyrolysis experiments, four phases, i.e., char, tar, aqueous phase, and gas, were obtained and characterized. The carbon distribution and the GHG emission from peat moss pyrolysis were determined.

AB Methane emission from a wetland was measured with the eddy covariance system. The location of the system allowed observation of methane efflux from areas that were covered by different vegetation types. The data presented in this paper were collected in the period between the 13th of June and the 31st of August 2012. During the warmest months of the summer, there was no strong correlation between methane emissions and either the water table depth or peat temperature. The presence of reed and cattail contributed to a pronounced diurnal pattern of the flux and lower methane emission, while areas covered by sedges emitted higher amounts more with no clear diurnal pattern.

AB Peatland drainage results in several environmental impacts such as release of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere and leaching of nutrients to watercourses. These hazardous environmental effects can partly be controlled with soil management, and different drainage and remediation practices. Grading is a new method developed for soils with low conductivity suffering from poor drainage, water logging and ice. The soil surface is graded towards the ditch to increase surface runoff and drainage. The present study compares environmental effects of peatland grading compared to traditional intense pipe drainage. Detailed measurements of hydrology, climate, leaching and gas emissions were carried Out at adjacent drainage areas with grass cultivation. Additional measurements were made at plots that were abandoned, cultivated with perennial crops, and remained as pristine peatlands. The results show that the leaching of nutrients is highest from pipe drainage. Climate gas emission was considerably higher at all managed sites than from the reference pristine site. Drainage, soil hydrology and soil nutrient status seemed to control gas emissions. The gas emissions were higher than assumed for Norwegian cold conditions. The results confirm observations made on peat soils in other climatic regions. The highest emissions of CO2 were observed when the soil temperature was high and groundwater table low. The N2O emission showed a large variation with no clear pattern. However, at some locations it peaked after a dry period when NO3-N was leached. More CH4 was emitted from the intensively drained site than the graded site, but more CO2 was emitted from the graded site. The difference in leaching and emission properties is partly due to differences in near surface hydrology. At grade sites, a faster runoff response to rainfall occur probably due to shallow throughfall or overland flow which provides better drainage. The abandoned peat field no longer in cultivation continued to leach greenhouse gases in a same way as the Cultivated sites. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Gaseous nitrogen exchanges from undrained peat soils and the effect of external nitrate input are poorly understood. This paper reports net N-2, and N2O exchanges as well as the short-term responses to nitrate addition from contrasting tussock and hollow soil habitats in an undrained monolith fen ecosystem located in northeast Poland. Gaseous N exchange rates were quantified by means of a He substitution technique. The net N-2 production in hollows (2.53 mg N m(-2) hour(-1)) was significantly higher than in tussocks (1.04 mg N m(-2) hour(-1)). Hollows also constituted a marked N2O sink (-3.04 mu g N m(-2) hour(-1)), while tussocks were a source for atmospheric N2O (2.08 mu g N m(-2) hour(-1)). Following amendment by NO3-, at a rate similar to atmospheric NO3- deposition (wet + dry), hollows showed a drastic shift to net production of N2O but a non-significant increase in N-2 production. In tussocks only a minor increase of N-2 and N2O production was observed after NO3- addition. This study emphasizes the influence of physico-chemical conditions and biotic resource competition on the rates and responses of microbial denitrification in undrained fen ecosystems. Inferring a simple field-scale estimation of gaseous N emission suggests that undrained, monolith fen ecosystems constitute substantial sources of N-2 (1.79 mg N m(-2) hour(-1)) and considerable sinks for N2O (-0.96 mu g N m(-2) hour(-1)). These findings are of importance to further improve greenhouse gas budgeting and assess the impacts of global change on undrained fen ecosystems.

AB The large boreal peatland ecosystems sequester carbon and nitrogen from the atmosphere due to a low oxygen pressure in waterlogged peat. Consequently they are sinks for CO(2) and strong emitters of CH(4). Drainage and cultivation of peatlands allows oxygen to enter the soil, which initiates decomposition of the stored organic material, and in turn CO(2) and N(2)O emissions increase while CH(4) emissions decrease. Compared to undrained pear, draining of organic soils for agricultural purposes increases the emissions of greenhouse gases (CO(2), CH(4) and N(2)O) by roughly it CO(2) equivalents/ha per year. Although farmed organic soils in most European countries represent a minor part of the total agricultural area, these soils contribute significantly to national greenhouse gas budgets. Consequently, farmed organic soils are potential targets for policy makers in search of socially acceptable and economically cost-efficient measures to mitigate climate gas emissions from agriculture. Despite a scarcity of knowledge about greenhouse gas emissions from these soils, this paper addresses the emissions and possible control of the three greenhouse gases by different managements of organic soils. More precise information is needed regarding the present trace gas fluxes from these soils, as well as predictions of future emissions under alternative management regimes, before any definite policies can be devised.

TI The Impact of Map and Data Resolution on the Determination of the
   Agricultural Utilisation of Organic Soils in Germany
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

DE Peatland; Agriculture; Modifiable areal unit problem; Land use intensity
AB Due to its nature, agricultural land use depends on local site characteristics such as production potential, costs and external effects. To assess the relevance of the modifying areal unit problem (MAUP), we investigated as to how a change in the data resolution regarding both soil and land use data influences the results obtained for different land use indicators. For the assessment we use the example of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculturally used organic soils (mainly fens and bogs). Although less than 5 % of the German agricultural area in use is located on organic soils, the drainage of these areas to enable their agricultural utilization causes roughly 37 % of the GHG emissions of the German agricultural sector. The abandonment of the cultivation and rewetting of organic soils would be an effective policy to reduce national GHG emissions. To assess the abatement costs, it is essential to know which commodities, and at what quantities, are actually produced on this land. Furthermore, in order to limit windfall profits, information on the differences of the profitability among farms are needed. However, high-resolution data regarding land use and soil characteristics are often not available, and their generation is costly or the access is strictly limited because of legal constraints. Therefore, in this paper, we analyse how indicators for land use on organic soils respond to changes in the spatial aggregation of the data. In Germany, organic soils are predominantly used for forage cropping. Marked differences between the various regions of Germany are apparent with respect to the dynamics and the intensity of land use. Data resolution mainly impairs the derived extent of agriculturally used peatland and the observed intensity gradient, while its impact on the average value for the investigated set of land-use indicators is generally minor.

LA English

DE Carbon cycle; Land-use change; Populus trichocarpa; Mitigation; Drained
   wetland
AB Drainage of peatlands increases the depth of the oxic peat layer and can turn them into a carbon (C) source to the atmosphere. Afforestation of drained peatlands could help to reverse this process since the trees may enhance C sequestration. We followed the C and water dynamics of an afforested drained peatland in S-Iceland during a 2 year period, during which the Black Cottonwood (Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa) plantation was 23-25 year old. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) was measured with the eddy covariance method and C pools of trees and ground vegetation were measured using the stock change method. Lateral losses of dissolved and particulated organic C (DOC, POC) were estimated from weekly water-runoff samples. Unexpectedly, the afforested drained peatland was a strong sink of carbon during the two years, with an average NEE value of 714 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Only 0.5% of the total NEE was lost through lateral DOC and POC transport, leaving 710 g C m(-2) yr(-1) as the total net ecosystem production (NEP). Ca. 91% of the observed NEP could be explained by the annual biomass increment of the Black Cottonwood trees and 1.3% by the ground vegetation. This means that the remaining 7.5% of the total NEP most likely accumulated in peat soil and litter, contributing to the soil C stocks. The dormant-season CO2 emissions were unexpectedly low, which was explained by a high groundwater level at this drained site outside the ca. 5 months of the active growing season. On average, 66% of the annual measured precipitation was estimated to have evaporated back to the atmosphere. This left 416 mm for potential runoff, which was somewhat lower value than the measured runoff (662 mm). These results indicate that during the age span of ca. 20-25 years, afforestation was a valid method to reverse the expected negative C-balance of this drained grassland pasture in Iceland. Although the site is currently a soil C sink, simulation studies with process models are needed to test whether such sites could remain C sinks when managed for forestry over several tree-stand rotations.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the controls on carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) dynamics on a blanket bog (at Pollagoona) and a raised bog (at Scohaboy) in Ireland after felling of plantation forestry and rewetting, and to produce annual balances for each gas at both sites. Gas fluxes were measured during a twelve-month period using the chamber method. Microsite types reflecting the dominant plant species at the chamber plots were identified and classified as Eriophorum-Sphagnum, Cladonia-Calluna and Molinia at Pollagoona and Eriophorum-Sphagnum, Cladonia-mosses, Eriophorum and brash (logging residues) at Scohaboy. The relationships between gas fluxes and environmental variables were assessed, and regression models were used to estimate annual CO2 and CH4 gas balances for each microsite type. Annual estimates of N2O exchange were calculated using seasonal means. Over the course of the study both sites acted as CO2 and CH4 sources. Although Pollagoona was an overall net source of CO2-C (131.6 +/- 298.3 g m(-2) yr(-1)), one microsite type (Cladonia-Calluna) acted as a strong sink for CO2-C (-142.8 g m(-2) yr(-1)). Molinia microsites exhibited the highest CH4-C emissions (2.53 +/- 1.01 g m(-2) yr(-1)). Nitrous oxide emissions at Pollagoona were calculated as 12 mu g m(-2) yr(-1). Scohaboy acted as a large CO2-C source (585.3 +/- 241.5 g m(-2) yr(-1)) (all microsite types) despite re-vegetation of non-brash plots, due to the availability of fresh organic matter across the site. Scohaboy was also a CH4-C source, emitting 3.25 +/- 0.58 g m(-2) yr(-1). Emissions of both CO2-C (819.31 +/- 57.7 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and CH4-C (4.76 +/- 0.98 g m(-2) yr(-1)) were highest from the brash plots. Annual N2O-N emissions were small over the study period (72 mu g m(-2) yr(-1)). Our results indicate that, despite remedial work being conducted on both peatlands to raise the water table, the C sink function has not yet been restored at either site.

AB Peatlands are one of the major natural sources of methane (CH4), but the quantification of efflux is uncertain especially during winter, fall and the highly dynamic spring thaw period. Here, we report pronounced diurnal variations in CH4 fluxes (F-CH4). measured using the eddy-covariance technique during the snow-thawing period at a boreal peat land in north-western Russia. Following the background winter emission of similar to 0.5 mg m(-2) h(-1), strong diurnal variability in CH4 fluxes from 21 April to 3 May was apparently controlled by changes in surface temperature (T-sur) and near-surface turbulence as indicated by the friction velocity (u*). CH4 fluxes were similar to 0.8 mg m(-2) h(-1) during night and similar to 3 mg m(-2) h(-1) during peak efflux. Primarily. the freeze-thaw cycle of an ice layer observed at the wet peatland microforms due to surface temperatures oscillating between >0 degrees C during the days and <0 degrees C during the nights appeared to strongly influence diurnal variability. Once the ice layer was melted, increases in wind speed seemed to enhance CH4 efflux, possibly by increased mixing of the water surface. Apparently, a combination of physical factors is influencing the gas transport processes of CH4 efflux during the highly dynamic spring thaw period.

AB The objective of this study was to estimate the contribution of drained organic forestlands in Sweden to the national greenhouse gas budget. Drained organic forestland in Sweden collectively comprises an estimated net sink for greenhouse gases of -5.0 Mt carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents year(-1) ( range -12.0 to 1.2) when default emission factors provided by the Good practice guidance for land use, land-use change and forestry are used, and an estimated net source of 0.8 Mt CO2 equivalents year(-1) ( range -6.7 to 5.1) when available emission data for the climatic zones spanned by Sweden are used. This discrepancy is mainly due to differences in the emission factors for heterotrophic respiration. The main uncertainties in the estimates are related to carbon changes in the litter pool and releases of soil CO2 and nitrous oxide.

AB Peatlands are becoming increasingly used as buffer areas to reduce nutrient transport into watercourses, but knowledge on the dynamics of the element cycle, particularly in gas phase is scant. We investigated if peatland buffer areas significantly contribute to emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) from forested catchments. We used an artificial addition of 150 kg NH4NO3 per buffer area (146-750 kg NH4NO3 ha(-1)) and quantified the N2O emission before and after the N loading. We conducted an extensive study with eight sampling positions and sampling interval of 1-5 weeks at five buffer areas, and an intensive study using 14 sampling positions and sampling frequency of 1-7 days at one area. In the extensive study, the average fluxes were -0.33-0.14 mg N2O m(-2) d(-1) before the N addition, and after the N addition they were 0.99-5.30 mg N2O m(-2) d(-1). During the intensive study, overall loss of N2O was estimated to be 0.74 kg N2O or 0.15 kg N2O ha(-1). Considering the impacts on stratospheric ozone depletion and global warming, the study indicated low N2O emissions even when N loading increased to higher level than is likely to occur under actual conditions in forested catchments.

   Forestry operations can cause disturbances in nutrient cycling. Protection of watercourses by trapping the leached solids and nutrients in sedimentation ponds and buffer zones may create a new greenhouse gases (GHG) source. We measured in situ nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in different parts of a spruce swamp buffer zone, N2O emissions from intact peat columns after fertilization with different ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) levels, and the rate and volume of in vivo N2O accumulation. N2O-producing micro-organisms existed throughout the buffer zone. The rate of N2O formation was highest at depths close to the prevailing water table within the buffer zone. Groundwater level and the vicinity of bypass water flows at the soil surface regulated the spatial and temporal variation in the rate of N2O efflux in the field. Nitrogen (N) addition rapidly increased in vivo N2O release. Microbial activity in the laboratory incubations under optimal conditions was high, but the in situ N2O efflux in the field was low. The actual leaching of mineral N from forestry areas was low and the inorganic N concentration in the buffer zone inflow was no higher than is typical for humic brooks or lakes in Finland. The low N2O fluxes indicated that forestry operations in the catchment did not result in significant N enrichment of the buffer zone. This study does not support the postulate that peatland buffer zones may become significant sources of N2O.

AB The focus of current water management in drained peatlands is to facilitate optimal drainage, which has led to soil subsidence and a strong increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Dutch land and water authorities proposed the application of subsoil irrigation (SSI) system on a large scale to potentially reduce GHG emissions, while maintaining high biomass production. Based on model results, the expectation was that SSI would reduce peat decomposition in summer by preventing groundwater tables (GWTs) from dropping below -60 cm. In 2017-2018, we evaluated the effects of SSI on GHG emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O) for four dairy farms on drained peat meadows in the Netherlands. Each farm had a treatment site with SSI installation and a control site drained only by ditches (ditch water level -60 / -90 cm, 100 m distance between ditches). The SSI system consisted of perforated pipes -70 cm from surface level with spacing of 5-6 m to improve drainage during winter-spring and irrigation in summer. GHG emissions were measured using closed chambers every 2-4 weeks for CO2, CH4 and N2O. Measured ecosystem respiration (R-eco) only showed a small difference between SSI and control sites when the GWT of SSI sites were substantially higher than the control site (> 20 cm difference). Over all years and locations, however, there was no significant difference found, despite the 6-18 cm higher GWT in summer and 1-20 cm lower GWT in wet conditions at SSI sites. Differences in mean annual GWT remained low (< 5 cm). Direct comparison of measured N2O and CH4 fluxes between SSI and control sites did not show any significant differences. CO2 fluxes varied according to temperature and management events, while differences between control and SSI sites remained small. Therefore, there was no difference between the annual gap-filled net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the SSI and control sites. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was on average 40 and 30 t CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1) in 2017 and 2018 on the SSI sites and 38 and 34 t CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1 )in 2017 and 2018 on the control sites. This lack of SSI effect is probably because the GWT increase remains limited to deeper soil layers (60-120 cm depth), which contribute little to peat oxidation.
   We conclude that SSI modulates water table dynamics but fails to lower annual carbon emission. SSI seems unsuitable as a climate mitigation strategy. Future research should focus on potential effects of GWT manipulation in the uppermost organic layers (-30 cm and higher) on GHG emissions from drained peatlands.

AB The carbon pool of peatlands has been considered as potentially unstable in a changing climate. This study is the first presenting carbon dioxide (CO2) net ecosystem exchange, CO2 efflux due to ecosystem respiration and CO2 uptake by gross primary production over a complete growing season for different microforms of a boreal peatland in Russia (61A degrees 56'N, 50A degrees 13'E). CO2 fluxes were measured using the closed chamber technique from the 25th April in the period of snow melt until the end of the vegetation period and the first frost on the 20th October 2008 at seven different microform types: minerogenous and ombrogenous hollows, lawns and hummocks, respectively, and Carex lawns situated in a transition zone between minerogenous and ombrogenous mire parts. The total number of chamber flux measurements was 5,517. Ombrogenous hummocks and lawns were sources of CO2 over the investigation period whereas hollows and minerogenous lawns were CO2 sinks. Some plots of Carex lawns and minerogenous hummocks were sinks while other plots of these microform types were sources. The CO2 fluxes were characterised by large variability not only between the microform types but also within the respective microform types. Of all microform types, the Carex, ombrogenous, and minerogenous lawns showed the highest variability in CO2 fluxes, which is probably related to a stronger within-microform heterogeneity in vegetation composition and coverage as well as in the water table level. Air temperature was one of the dominant controls on the CO2 flux dynamics. Water table and green area index were found to have strong influence on CO2 fluxes both within different patches of the same microform type as well as between different microforms.

ID NITROUS-OXIDE FLUXES
AB A quantum cascade laser spectrometer was evaluated for eddy covariance flux measurements of CH4 and N2O using three months of continuous measurements at a field site. The required criteria for eddy covariance flux measurements including continuity, sampling frequency, precision and stationarity were examined. The system operated continuously at a dairy farm on peat grassland in the Netherlands from 17 August to 6 November 2006. An automatic liquid nitrogen filling system for the infrared detector was employed to provide unattended operation of the system. The electronic sampling frequency was 10 Hz, however, the flow response time was 0.08 s, which corresponds to a bandwidth of 2 Hz. A precision of 2.9 and 0.5 ppb Hz(-1/2) was obtained for CH4 and N2O, respectively. Accuracy was assured by frequent calibrations using low and high standard additions. Drifts in the system were compensated by using a 120 s running mean filter. The average CH4 and N2O exchange was 512 ngC m(-2) hr(-1) (2.46 mg m(-2)h r(-1)) and 52 ngN m(-2) s(-1) (0.29 mg m(-2) hr(-1)). Given that 40% of the total N2O emission was due to a fertilizing event.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions from drained agricultural peatlands contribute significantly to global warming. In a laboratory study using intact cores of peat soil from eight different sites in Sweden, factors controlling the emission of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) were examined. Soil properties, and the abundance of the total microbial community (16S rRNA gene abundance), and genes encoding for functions controlling N2O emissions (bacterial and archaeal amoA, nirS, nirK, nosZI, and nosZII) were analyzed and compared against measured greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions were measured at different drainage levels, i.e., higher soil water suction values, since drainage is an important factor controlling greenhouse gas emissions from peat soils. The results showed that N2O and CH4 emissions were generally low, except for N2O emissions at near water-saturated conditions, for which three soils displayed high values and large variations in fluxes. Relationships between N2O emissions and soil properties were mainly linked to soil pH, with higher emissions at lower pH. However, specific assemblages of nitrogen cycling guilds that included nosZII, typically present in non-denitrifying N2O reducers, were detected in soils with low N2O emissions. Overall, these results indicate that both pH and biotic controls determine net N2O fluxes.

AB In spite of advances in greenhouse gas research, the spatiotemporal CH4 and N2O dynamics of boreal land-scapes remain challenging, e.g., we need clarification of whether forest-mire transitions are occasional hotspots of landscape CH4 and N2O emissions during exceptionally high and low ground water level events.
   In our study, we tested the differences and drivers of CH4 and N2O dynamics of forest/mire types in field conditions along the soil moisture gradient of the forest-mire ecotone. Soils changed from Podzols to Histosols and ground water rose downslope from a depth of 10m in upland sites to 0.1m in mires. Yearly meteorological conditions changed from being exceptionally wet to typical and exceptionally dry for the local climate. The median fluxes measured with a static chamber technique varied from -51 to 586 mu gm(-2) h(-1) for CH4 and from 0 to 6 mu m(-2) h(-1) for N2O between forest and mire types throughout the entire wet-dry period.
   In spite of the highly dynamic soil water fluctuations in carbon rich soils in forest-mire transitions, there were no large peak emissions in CH4 and N2O fluxes and the flux rates changed minimally between years. Methane uptake was significantly lower in poorly drained transitions than in the well-drained uplands. Water-saturated mires showed large CH4 emissions, which were reduced entirely during the exceptional summer drought period. Near-zero N2O fluxes did not differ significantly between the forest and mire types probably due to their low nitrification potential. When up-scaling boreal landscapes, pristine forest-mire transitions should be regarded as CH4 sinks and minor N2O sources instead of CH4 and N2O emission hotspots.

AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from farmed organic soils can have a major impact on national emission budgets. This investigation was conducted to evaluate whether afforestation of such soils could mitigate this problem. Over the period 1994-1997, emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were recorded from an organic soil site in Sweden, forested with silver birch (Betula pendula Roth), using static field chambers. The site was used for grazing prior to forestation. Soil pH and soil carbon content varied greatly across the site. The soil pH ranged from 3.6 to 5.9 and soil carbon from 34 to 42%.
   The mean annual N2O emission was 19.4 (+/- 6.7) kg N2O-N ha(-1) and was strongly correlated with soil pH (r = -0.93, P < 0.01) and soil carbon content (r = 0.97, P < 0.001). The N2O emissions showed large spatial and temporal variability with greatest emissions during the summer periods. The site was a sink for CH4 (i.e. -0.8 (+/- 0.5) kg CH4 ha(-1) year(-1)) and the flux correlated well with the C/N ratio (r = 0.93, P < 0.01), N2O emission (r = 0.92, P < 0.01), soil pH (r = -0.95, P < 0.01) and soil carbon (r = 0.97, P < 0.001). CH4 flux followed a seasonal pattern, with uptake dominating during the summer, and emission during winter.
   This study indicates that, because of the large N2O emissions, afforestation may not mitigate the GHG emissions from fertile peat soils with acidic pH, although it can reduce the net GHG because of greater CO2 assimilation by the trees compared with agricultural crops.

AB After drainage of natural boreal peatlands, the decomposition of organic matter increases and peat soil may turn into a net source of CO2 and N2O, whereas CH4 emission is known to decrease. Afforestation is a potential mitigation strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emission from organic agricultural soils. A static chamber technique was used to evaluate the fluxes of CH4, N2O and CO2 from three boreal organic agricultural soils in western Finland, afforested 1, 6 or 23 years before this study. The mean emissions of CH4 and N2O during the growing seasons did not correlate with the age of the tree stand. All sites were sources of N2O. The highest daily N2O emission during the growing season, measured in the oldest site, was as high as 29 mg N2O m(-2)d(-1). In general, organic agricultural soils are sinks for methane. Here, the oldest site acted as a small sink for methane, whereas the two youngest afforested organic soils were sources for methane with maximum emission rates (up to 154 mg m(-2)d(-1)) similar to those reported for minerogenous natural peatlands. Soil respiration rates decreased with the age of the forest. The high soil respiration in the younger sites, probably resulted from the high biomass production of herbs, could create soil anaerobiosis and increase methane production. Our results show that afforestation of agricultural peat soils does not abruptly terminate the N2O emissions during the first two decades, and afforestation can even enhance methane emission for a few years. The carbon accumulation in the developing tree stand can partly compensate the carbon loss from soil.

AB Northern peatlands in permafrost regions contain a large amount of organic carbon (C) in the soil. Climate warming and associated permafrost degradation are expected to have significant impacts on the C balance of these ecosystems, but the magnitude is uncertain. We incorporated a permafrost model, Northern Ecosystem Soil Temperature (NEST), into a biogeochemical model, DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC), to model C dynamics in high-latitude peatland ecosystems. The enhanced model was applied to assess effects of permafrost thaw on C fluxes of a subarctic peatland at Stordalen, Sweden. DNDC simulated soil freeze-thaw dynamics, net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), and CH4 fluxes across three typical land cover types, which represent a gradient in the process of ongoing permafrost thaw at Stordalen. Model results were compared with multiyear field measurements, and the validation indicates that DNDC was able to simulate observed differences in seasonal soil thaw, NEE, and CH4 fluxes across the three land cover types. Consistent with the results from field studies, the modeled C fluxes across the permafrost thaw gradient demonstrate that permafrost thaw and the associated changes in soil hydrology and vegetation not only increase net uptake of C from the atmosphere but also increase the annual to decadal radiative forcing impacts on climate due to increased CH4 emissions. This study indicates the potential of utilizing biogeochemical models, such as DNDC, to predict the soil thermal regime in permafrost areas and to investigate impacts of permafrost thaw on ecosystem C fluxes after incorporating a permafrost component into the model framework.

AB Lakes and wetlands, common ecosystems of the high northern latitudes, exchange large amounts of the climate-forcing gases methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) with the atmosphere. The magnitudes of these fluxes and the processes driving them are still uncertain, particularly for subarctic and Arctic lakes where direct measurements of CH4 and CO2 emissions are often of low temporal resolution and are rarely sustained throughout the entire year.
   Using the eddy covariance method, we measured surface-atmosphere exchange of CH4 and CO2 during 2.5 years in a thawed fen and a shallow lake of a subarctic peatland complex. Gas exchange at the fen exhibited the expected seasonality of a subarctic wetland with maximum CH4 emissions and CO2 uptake in summer, as well as low but continuous emissions of CH4 and CO2 throughout the snow-covered winter. The seasonality of lake fluxes differed, with maximum CO2 and CH4 flux rates recorded at spring thaw. During the ice-free seasons, we could identify surface CH4 emissions as mostly ebullition events with a seasonal trend in the magnitude of the release, while a net CO2 flux indicated photosynthetic activity. We found correlations between surface CH4 emissions and surface sediment temperature, as well as between diel CO2 uptake and diel solar input. During spring, the breakdown of thermal stratification following ice thaw triggered the degassing of both CH4 and CO2. This spring burst was observed in 2 consecutive years for both gases, with a large inter-annual variability in the magnitude of the CH4 degassing.
   On the annual scale, spring emissions converted the lake from a small CO2 sink to a CO2 source: 80% of total annual carbon emissions from the lake were emitted as CO2. The annual total carbon exchange per unit area was highest at the fen, which was an annual sink of carbon with respect to the atmosphere. Continuous respiration during the winter partly counteracted the fen summer sink by accounting for, as both CH4 and CO2, 33% of annual carbon exchange. Our study shows (1) the importance of overturn periods (spring or fall) for the annual CH4 and CO2 emissions of northern lakes, (2) the significance of lakes as atmospheric carbon sources in subarctic landscapes while fens can be a strong carbon sink, and (3) the potential for ecosystem-scale eddy covariance measurements to improve the understanding of short-term processes driving lake-atmosphere exchange of CH4 and CO2.

AB Wood ash (3.1, 3.3 or 6.6 tonnes dry weight ha(-1)) was used to fertilize two drained and forested peatland sites in southern Sweden. The sites were chosen to represent the Swedish peatlands that are most suitable for ash fertilization, with respect to stand growth response. The fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from the forest floor, measured using opaque static chambers, were monitored at both sites during 2004 and 2005 and at one of the sites during the period 1 October 2007-1 October 2008. No significant (p>0.05) changes in forest floor greenhouse gas exchange were detected. The annual emissions of CO2 from the sites varied between 6.4 and 15.4 tonnes ha(-1), while the CH4 fluxes varied between 1.9 and 12.5 kg ha(-1). The emissions of N2O were negligible. Ash fertilization increased soil pH at a depth of 0-0.05 m by up to 0.9 units (p<0.01) at one site, 5 years after application, and by 0.4 units (p<0.05) at the other site, 4 years after application. Over the first 5 years after fertilization, the mean annual tree stand basal area increment was significantly larger (p<0.05) at the highest ash dose plots compared with control plots (0.64 m(2) ha(-1) year(-1) and 0.52 m(2) ha(-1) year(-1), respectively). The stand biomass, which was calculated using tree biomass functions, was not significantly affected by the ash treatment. The groundwater levels during the 2008 growing season were lower in the high ash dose plots than in the corresponding control plots (p<0.05), indicating increased evapotranspiration as a result of increased tree growth. The larger basal area increment and the lowered groundwater levels in the high ash dose plots suggest that fertilization promoted tree growth, while not affecting greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Under low nitrogen (N) input into rain-fed peat bogs, Sphagnum moss efficiently filters incoming N, preventing invasion of vascular plants and peat oxygenation. Elevated atmospheric N deposition, in combination with climatic warming, may cause retreat of bryophytes and degradation of peat deposits. There are concerns that higher emissions of greenhouse gases, accompanying peat thinning, will accelerate global warming. Breakthrough of deposited N below livingmoss has been quantified for two Central European peat bogs dominated by Sphagnum magellanicum. In the 1990s, the northern site, ZL, received three times more atmospheric N (> 40 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) than the southern site, BS. Today, atmospheric N inputs at both sites are comparable (15 and 11 kg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively). Replicated peat cores were collected from the wet central segments of both study sites, N-15-NO(3)(-)tracer was applied on the moss surface, and the peat cores were incubated under water-logged conditions. After 40 weeks, the rate of downcore leaching of the N-15 tracer was assessed. The recent history of high N pollution at ZL did not accelerate N-15 penetration into deeper peat layers, relative to BS. At both sites, less than 3% of the N-15 tracer reached the shallow depth of 9 cm. Analysis of control peat cores, along with a Pb-210 chronology, revealed removal of the "excess" Nfrom the ZL peat profiles prior to sampling. Following a decrease of atmospheric N pollution in the past two decades, efficient filtering of atmospheric N by Sphagnum at ZL has been renewed.

AB The Kyoto Protocol accepts terrestrial sinks for greenhouse gases (GHGs) as offsets for fossil fuel emissions. Only carbon sequestered in Living biomass from re- and afforestation is presently considered, but the Protocol contains a provision for the possible future inclusion of other land uses and soils. As a result, the possibility of sequestration of carbon in wetlands, and particularly peatlands, is being discussed. Natural peatlands are presently a relatively small sink for CO2 and a large source of CH4: globally, they store between 400 and 500 Gt C. There are large variations among peatlands, but when the "global warming potential" of CH4 is factored in, many peatlands are neither sinks nor sources of GHGs. Some land-use changes may result in peatlands acting as net sinks far GHGs by reducing CH4 emissions and/or increasing CO2 sequestration (e.g., forest drainage), while other land uses may result in large losses of CO2, CH4, and N2O (e.g., agriculture on organic soils, flooding for hydroelectric generation). Other land uses, such as peatland creation and restoration, produce no net change if they are replacing or restoring a previous level of GHG exchange. These are analogous to reforestation of deforested areas. On closer examination, the inclusion of peatlands in a national greenhouse gas strategy as sinks, despite their large role in the terrestrial carbon cycle, may not significantly reduce net greenhouse gas emissons. If the sinks are to be considered, it is reasonable that terrestrial sources associated with all land uses on peatlands also should be considered. If peatlands are not considered explicitly, but soils in forest and agriculture systems are included in the Kyoto Protocol in the future, then those peatlands impacted by these land uses will be incorporated implicitly.

AB Globally, peat lands are considered to be a sink of CO2, but a source when drained. Additionally, wet peat lands are thought to emit considerable amounts of CH4 and N2O. Hitherto, reliable and integrated estimates of emissions and emission factors for this type of land cover have been lacking and the effects of wetland restoration on methane emissions have been poorly quantified. In this paper we estimate the full greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of a restored natural peat land by determining the fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O through atmosphere and water, while accounting for the different Global Warming Potentials (GWP's).
   The site is an abandoned agricultural peat meadow, which has been converted into a wetland nature reserve ten years ago, after which the water level was raised. GHG fluxes were measured continuously with an eddy covariance system (CO2) and flux chamber measurements (CH4 and N2O). Meteorological and hydrological measurements were collected as well. With growing seasons of respectively 192, 168 and 129 days, the annual net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was -446+ +/- 83 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2004, -311 +/- 58 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2005 and -232 +/- 57 g m(-2) yr(-1) for 2006. Ecosystem respiration (Reco) was estimated as 869 +/- 668 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2004, 866 +/- 666 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2005 and 924 +/- 711 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2006. CH4 emissions from the saturated land and water surfaces were high compared to the relatively dry land. Annual weighted CH4 emissions were 31.27 +/- 20.40 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2005 and 32.27 +/- 21.08 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2006. N2O fluxes were too low to be of significance. The water balance of the area was dominated by precipitation and evapotranspiration and therefore fluxes of carbon and CH4 through seepage, infiltration and drainage were relatively small (17.25 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The carbon- balance consisted for the largest part of CO2 uptake, CO2 respiration and CH4 emission from water saturated land and water. CO2 emission has decreased significantly as result of the raised water table, while CH4 fluxes have increased. In GWP's the area was a small net GHG sink given as CO2- equiv. of - 86 g m(-2) yr(-1) (over a 100-year period).

AB Flooded peat wetlands are an important global carbon pool and are relatively sensitive to frost degeneration due to global climate change. To study the dynamics of greenhouse gas (GHG) formations in the soil of a flooded peat marsh in response to freeze-thaw processes, CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes and gas concentrations at different soil depths were measured in a flooded peat marsh in Northeast China during a freeze-thaw period (from November 2004 to July 2005). During the freeze period, the gas concentrations underneath the frozen soil increased as the freeze developed until the soil completely froze in the root (15-35 cm) and peat (35-80 cm) layers. The highest gas concentrations accumulated in the gley layer (80-120 cm) when the greatest freeze depth formed. During the thaw period, the gas concentrations increased above the frozen layer (15-60 cm); in contrast, the gas concentrations underneath the frozen layer (60-120 cm) rapidly decreased when the bottom of the frozen layer began to thaw. GHG emissions from the marsh were not correlated with gas concentrations underneath the frozen layer during the freeze period but were significantly correlated with gas concentrations above the frozen layer (15-60 cm) during the thaw period. The study suggested that large changes in GHG formation dynamics occurred underneath the frost in the flooded peat marsh when the frost began to thaw due to gas physical diffusion within the peat layer.

AB Drainage of peatlands affects the fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Organic soils used for agriculture contribute a large proportion of anthropogenic GHG emissions, and on-farm mitigation options are important. This field study investigated whether choice of a cropping system can be used to mitigate emissions of N2O and influence CH4 fluxes from cultivated organic and carbon-rich soils during the growing season. Ten different sites in southern Sweden representing peat soils, peaty marl and gyttja clay, with a range of different soil properties, were used for on-site measurements of N2O and CH4 fluxes. The fluxes during the growing season from soils under two different crops grown in the same field and same environmental conditions were monitored. Crop intensities varied from grasslands to intensive potato cultivation. The results showed no difference in median seasonal N2O emissions between the two crops compared. Median seasonal emissions ranged from 0 to 919 mu g N(2)Om(-2) h(-1), with peaks on individual sampling occasions of up to 3317 mu g N(2)Om(-2) h(-1). Nitrous oxide emissions differed widely between sites, indicating that soil properties are a regulating factor. However, pH was the only soil factor that correlated with N2O emissions (negative exponential correlation). The type of crop grown on the soil did not influence CH4 fluxes. Median seasonal CH4 flux from the different sites ranged from uptake of 36 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1) to release of 4.5 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1). From our results, it was concluded that farmers cannot mitigate N2O emissions during the growing season or influence CH4 fluxes by changing the cropping system in the field.

TI FAOSTAT estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from biomass and peat
   fires
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID SATELLITE
AB The Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED3) and the FAOSTAT Emissions database, containing estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from biomass burning and peat fires, are compared. The two datasets formed the basis for several analyses in the fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5), and thus represent a critical source of information for emissions inventories at national, regional and global level. The two databases differ in their level of computational complexity in estimating emissions. While both use the same burned area information from remote sensing, estimates of available biomass are computed in GFED3 at tier 3 using a complex dynamic vegetation model, while they are computed in FAOSTAT using default, tier 1 parameters from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Over the analysis period 1997-2011, the two methods were found to produce very similar global GHG emissions estimates for each of the five GFED aggregated biomass fire classes: i) Savanna; ii) Woodland; iii) Forest; iv) Deforestation; v) Peatlands; with total emissions ranging 6-8 Gt CO2eq yr(-1). The main differences between the two datasets were found with respect to peat fires, with FAOSTAT showing a lower 1997-1998 peak in emissions compared with GFED3, within an otherwise good agreement for the rest of the study period, when limited to the three tropical countries covered by GFED. Conversely, FAOSTAT global emissions from peat fires, including both boreal and tropical regions, were several times larger than those currently estimated by GFED3. Results show that FAOSTAT activity data and emission estimates for biomass fires offer a robust alternative to the more sophisticated GFED data, representing a valuable resource for national GHG inventory experts, especially in countries where technical and institutional constraints may limit access, generation and maintenance of more complex methodologies and data.

AB Plant communities play a key role in regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in peatland ecosystems and therefore in their ability to act as carbon (C) sinks. However, in response to global change, a shift from Sphagnum-dominated to vascular-plant-dominated peatlands may occur, with a potential alteration in their C-sink function. To investigate how the main GHG fluxes (CO2 and CH4) are affected by a plant community change (shift from dominance of Sphagnum mosses to vascular plants, i.e., Molinia caerulea), a mesocosm experiment was set up. Gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and CH4 emission models were used to estimate the annual C balance and global warming potential under both vegetation covers. While the ER and CH4 emission models estimated an output of, respectively, 376 +/- 108 and 7 +/- 4 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Sphagnum mesocosms, this reached 1018 +/- 362 and 33 +/- 8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in mesocosms with Sphagnum rubellum and Molinia caerulea. Annual modeled GPP was estimated at -414 +/- 122 and -1273 +/- 482 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Sphagnum and Sphagnum + Molinia plots, respectively, leading to an annual CO2 and CH4 budget of -30 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Sphagnum plots and of -223 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Sphagnum + Molinia ones (i.e., a C sink). Even if CH4 emissions accounted for a small part of the gaseous C efflux (ca. 3 %), their global warming potential value makes both plant communities have a climate warming effect. The shift of vegetation from Sphagnum mosses to Molinia caerulea seems beneficial for C sequestration at a gaseous level. However, roots and litter of Molinia caerulea could provide substrates for C emissions that were not taken into account in the short measurement period studied here.

AB Peatlands cover more than 30% of the Finnish land area and impact N2O fluxes. Denitrifiers release N2O as an intermediate or end product. In situ N2O emissions of a near pH neutral pristine fen soil in Finnish Lapland were marginal during gas chamber measurements. However, nitrate and ammonium fertilization significantly stimulated in situ N2O emissions. Stimulation with nitrate was stronger than with ammonium. N2O was produced and subsequently consumed in gas chambers. In unsupplemented anoxic microcosms, fen soil produced N2O only when acetylene was added to block nitrous oxide reductase, suggesting complete denitrification. Nitrate and nitrite stimulated denitrification in fen soil, and maximal reaction velocities (v(max)) of nitrate or nitrite dependent denitrification where 18 and 52 nmol N2O h(-1) g(DW)(-1), respectively. N2O was below 30% of total produced N gases in fen soil when concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were <500 mu M. v(max) for N2O consumption was up to 36 nmol N2O h(-1) gDW(-1). Denitrifier diversity was assessed by analyses of narG, nirK/nirS, and nosZ (encoding nitrate-, nitrite-, and nitrous oxide reductases, respectively) by barcoded amplicon pyrosequencing. Analyses of similar to 14,000 quality filtered sequences indicated up to 25 species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and up to 359 OTUs at 97% sequence similarity, suggesting diverse denitrifiers. Phylogenetic analyses revealed clusters distantly related to publicly available sequences, suggesting hitherto unknown denitrifiers. Representatives of species-level OTUs were affiliated with sequences of unknown soil bacteria and Actinobacterial, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Delta-Proteobacterial sequences. Comparison of the 4 gene markers at 97% similarity indicated a higher diversity of narG than for the other gene markers based on Shannon indices and observed number of OTUs. The collective data indicate (i) a high denitrification and N2O consumption potential, and (ii) a highly diverse, nitrate limited denitrifier community associated with potential N2O fluxes in a pH-neutral fen soil.

AB Natural and seminatural terrestrial ecosystems (unmanaged peatlands and forests and extensive and intensive grasslands) have been under-represented in the UK greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory. Mechanistic studies of GHG fluxes and their controls can improve the prediction of the currently uncertain GHG annual emission estimates. The source apportionment of N2O emissions can further inform management plans for GHG mitigation. We have measured in situ GHG fluxes monthly in two replicated UK catchments and evaluated their environmental controlling factors. An adapted N-15-gas flux method with low addition of N-15 tracer (0.03-0.5kg(15)Nha(-1)) was used to quantify the relative contribution of denitrification to net N2O production. Total N2O fluxes were 40 times higher in the intensive grasslands than in the peatlands (range: -1.32 to 312.3gNm(-2)h(-1)). The contribution of denitrification to net N2O emission varied across the land use types and ranged from 9 to 60%. Soil moisture was the key parameter regulating the partitioning of N2O sources (r(2)=0.46). Total N2O fluxes were explained by a simple model (r(2)=0.83) including parameters such as total dissolved nitrogen, organic carbon, and water content. A parsimonious model with the soil moisture content as a single scalar parameter explained 84% of methane flux variability across land uses. The assumption that 1% of the atmospherically deposited N on natural ecosystems is emitted as N2O could be overestimated or underestimated (0.3-1.6%). The use of land use-specific N2O emission factors and further information on N2O source partitioning should help constrain this uncertainty.

This study uses the principal-agent model to examine a peatland retirement programme to reduce agricultural emissions in Norway. The focus is on the role of the government's private information in programme design. Two cases are examined. First, optimal contracts are derived when farmers have private information about the costs of implementing peat land retirement, but the government reveals its information on the resulting public benefits through differentiated contracts. This corresponds to the standard targeting strategy with one-sided information asymmetry. In the second case, an informed principal model developed by Maskin and Tirole in a 1990 study is employed to address bilateral information asymmetry. Using the informed principal model, the government offers the same menu of contracts to farmers in order not to disclose information on the public benefits from land retirement. Empirical results show that the government can achieve a higher payoff by using a pooling offer.

AB The extent of groundwater-influenced rich fens is increasing across northern regions as permafrost thaws. The increase in the extent of these fens, which store large amounts of carbon in deep organic deposits, is coupled to increases in rainfall and runoff. We examine interannual variations in carbon and water fluxes at a rich fen in interior Alaska that included early (May-June) and mid-late (July-September) dry and wet periods, with early season wet periods coincident with runoff from snowmelt and later season wet periods coincident with inundation from rainfall. From May 2011 to December 2018, the fen was estimated as a 170 +/- 64 g C m(-2)source of CO2. When controlling for soil temperature, net CO(2)uptake was greatest during the early season under dry conditions, with the water table position below the surface, and least during the mid-late season when the water table position was above the surface. Methane emissions were lowest during early season wet periods and greatest during late season wet periods. Our results suggest that it is important to consider the seasonality of wet and dry periods, and how these may potentially be related to runoff from snowmelt versus rainfall in boreal rich fens, when considering the annual net C balance and making accurate projections of carbon balance in northern wetlands.

AB New raw materials for transportation fuels need to be introduced, in order to fight against climate change and also to cope with increasing risks of availability and price of oil. Peat has been recognised suitable raw material option for diesel produced by gasification and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. The energy content of Finnish peat reserves is remarkable. In this study, the greenhouse impact of peat-based FT diesel production and utilisation in Finland was assessed from the life-cycle point of view. In 100 year's time horizon the greenhouse impact of peat-based FT diesel is likely larger than the impact of fossil diesel. The impact can somewhat be lowered by producing peat from the agricultural peatland (strong greenhouse gas emissions from the decaying peatlayer are avoided) with new peat production technique, and utilising the produced biomass from the after-treatment area for diesel also. if diesel production is integrated with pulp and paper mill to achieve energy efficiency benefits and if the electricity demand can be covered by zero emission electricity, the greenhouse impact of peat-based FT diesel reduces to the level of fossil diesel when agricultural peatland is used, and is somewhat higher when forestry-drained peatland is used as raw material source.

AB The influence of forest stand age in a Picea sitchensis plantation on (1) soil fluxes of three greenhouse gases (GHGs - CO2, CH4 and N2O) and (2) overall net ecosystem global warming potential (GWP), was investigated in a 2-year study. The objective was to isolate the effect of forest stand age on soil edaphic characteristics (temperature, water table and volumetric moisture) and the consequent influence of these characteristics on the GHG fluxes. Fluxes were measured in a chronosequence in Harwood, England, with sites comprising 30- and 20-year-old second rotation forest and a site clearfelled (CF) some 18 months before measurement. Adjoining unforested grassland (UN) acted as a control. Comparisons were made between flux data, soil temperature and moisture data and, at the 30-year-old and CF sites, eddy covariance data for net ecosystem carbon (C) exchange (NEE). The main findings were: firstly, integrated CO2 efflux was the dominant influence on the GHG budget, contributing 93-94% of the total GHG flux across the chronosequence compared with 6-7% from CH4 and N2O combined. Secondly, there were clear links between the trends in edaphic factors as the forest matured, or after clearfelling, and the emission of GHGs. In the chronosequence sites, annual fluxes of CO2 were lower at the 20-year-old (20y) site than at the 30-year-old (30y) and CF sites, with soil temperature the dominant control. CH4 efflux was highest at the CF site, with peak flux 491 +/- 54.5 mu g m(-2) h(-1) and maximum annual flux 18.0 +/- 1.1 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1). No consistent uptake of CH4 was noted at any site. A linear relationship was found between log CH4 flux and the closeness of the water table to the soil surface across all sites. N2O efflux was highest in the 30y site, reaching 108 +/- 38.3 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) (171 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1)) in midsummer and a maximum annual flux of 4.7 +/- 1.2 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1) in 2001. Automatic chamber data showed a positive exponential relationship between N2O flux and soil temperature at this site. The relationship between N2O emission and soil volumetric moisture indicated an optimum moisture content for N2O flux of 40-50% by volume. The relationship between C : N ratio data and integrated N2O flux was consistent with a pattern previously noted across temperate and boreal forest soils.

AB Peatlands are ecosystems for which carbon budget relies strongly on the meteorological and hydrological conditions. Here, using a manipulative field experiment, we measured ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) over two years (2013-2014) in a poor fen in Poland to estimate the carbon emission in a changing climate. The experiment consisted of warming (open-top chambers - OTC) and water table manipulation. The application of OTC increased the mean values of daily maximum air temperature by approx. 1.1-1.8 A degrees C. Warming or the increased water table depth separately resulted in an increase in ecosystem respiration by approx. 0.1 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) and 0.3 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), respectively. However, our results show also the additive nature of warming and water table drawdown impact on daily R-ECO during the studied years (2013-0.80 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) and 2014-1.16 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). With the natural dry period event which occurred in 2014, the seasonal R-ECO increased by approx. 0.2 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) as compared to the previous year. Projected global warming will therefore significantly enhance C loss from poor fens in this region of Europe.

AB As increased greenhouse gas concentrations (GHG: N2O, CO2, CH4) in our atmosphere remain a major concern, better quantifying GHG fluxes from natural systems is essential. In this study, we investigate GHG concentrations in saturated riparian sediments (dry, wet, mucky), streambed hyporheic zone sediments (pools, riffles), and stream water in a New York mountain stream for summer baseflow conditions, and attempt to identify the primary drivers (e.g., DO, DOC, NO3-, and NH4+, temp) of GHG concentrations at these locations. Although DO, DOC, NO3-, and NH4+ concentration patterns certainly explained some of the observed trends, the overall differences in GHG abundance in riparian water vs. hyporheic pool water vs. hyporheic riffle water strongly suggest that water velocity/mixing with the atmosphere is a key control on GHG concentration across locations. When all flood-plain locations are considered, in-stream pools are hot spots of CO2 and CH4 concentrations relative to other in-streamlocations. On the other hand, riparian areas are hot spots of CH4 and CO2 concentrations relative to stream locations. No clear patterns are observed for N2O.

AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to composting of organic waste and the use of compost were assessed from a waste management perspective. The GHG accounting for composting includes use of electricity and fuels, emissions of methane and nitrous oxide from the composting process, and savings obtained by the use of the compost. The GHG account depends on waste type and composition (kitchen organics, garden waste), technology type (open systems, closed systems, home composting), the efficiency of off-gas cleaning at enclosed composting systems, and the use of the compost. The latter is an important issue and is related to the long-term binding of carbon in the soil, to related effects in terms of soil improvement and to what the compost substitutes; this could be fertilizer and peat for soil improvement or for growth media production. The overall global warming factor (GWF) for composting therefore varies between significant savings (-900 kg CO2-equivalents tonne(-1) wet waste (ww)) and a net load (300 kg CO2-equivalents tonne(-1) ww). The major savings are obtained by use of compost as a substitute for peat in the production of growth media. However, it may be difficult for a specific composting plant to document how the compost is used and what it actually substitutes for. Two cases representing various technologies were assessed showing how GHG accounting can be done when specific information and data are available.

AB Assessment of land use related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on larger spatial scales is usually achieved by modelling. Surface flux measurements are expensive and measurement locations too widely scattered to serve as spatially reliable flux estimates. Here we assess CO2 and CH4 fluxes from wetland nature reserves in the Dutch province of Drenthe, using the PEATLAND-VU model. Since surface flux observations in the province are absent and cannot be obtained in a short (<1 year) time frame, we extrapolated model validation from elsewhere to the research area. In this way a cost-effective methodology is developed for landuse-related greenhouse gas emission assessments, which can be applied by local governments at a subnational scale.
   Nature development and restoration in the Netherlands involves usually the restoration of high water tables in former agricultural areas and extensivation or abandonment of agricultural activities. Wet peat soils are known to emit considerable quantities of CH4, while drained agricultural soils emit CO2 from decomposition of the soil organic matter. Therefore, these landuse changes may affect GHG emissions and an assessment of their effects is useful for environmental policy.
   The PEATLAND-VU Model was used to simulate the CH4 and CO2 emissions for the years 2005-2007 and for May/June 2008. Previous field validation of the model elsewhere was checked for local validity with CH4 and CO2 flux measurements in short field campaigns in May/June 2008, at two locations, Visvliet and Balloerveld. These sites represent respectively eutrophic and oligotrophic peat and peaty soils, and showed large differences in fluxes. These flux differences were simulated correctly by the model by adapting the vegetation net primary production and methane oxidation parameters. Next, model simulations were run for eight combinations of vegetation and soil type. Using the simulated fluxes and the areal extent of the soil combinations, a GIS-based upscaling over all nature reserves was made.
   This study shows that river valley floors with mesotrophic and eutrophic peat soils dominate the greenhouse fluxes of the area. CH4 fluxes are high in wet terrain, while the CO2 fluxes are high when water table is lower. The fluxes from oligotrophic peat soils are comparatively low. Nature development can contribute to a decrease of the total greenhouse gas flux from peat soils and to conservation of soil organic matter.

AB Black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.) forests on peat soils have been reported to be hotspots for high nitrous oxide (N2O) losses. High emissions may be attributed to alternating water tables of peatlands and to the incorporation of high amounts of easily decomposable nitrogen (N) into the ecosystem by symbiotic dinitrogen (N-2)-fixation of alder trees. Our study addressed the question to what extent drainage enhances the emissions of N2O from black alder forests and how N turnover processes and physical factors influence the production of N2O and total denitrification. The study was conducted in a drained black alder forest with variable groundwater tables at a southern German fen peatland. Fluxes of N2O were measured using the closed chamber method at two drained sites (D-1 and D-2) and one undrained site (U). Inorganic N contents and net N mineralization rates (NNM) were determined. Additionally a laboratory incubation experiment was carried out to investigate greenhouse gas and N-2 fluxes at different temperature and soil moisture conditions. Significantly different inorganic N contents and NNM rates were observed, which however did not result in significantly different N2O fluxes in the field but did in the laboratory experiment. N2O fluxes measured were low for all sites, with total annual emissions of 0.51 +/- 0.07 (U), 0.97 +/- 0.13 (D-1) and 0.93 +/- 0.08 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) (D-2). Only 37% of the spatiotemporal variation in field N2O fluxes could be explained by peat temperature and groundwater level, demonstrating the complex interlinking of the controlling factors for N2O emissions. However, temperature was one of the key variables of N2O fluxes in the incubation experiment conducted. Increasing soil moisture content was found to enhance total denitrification losses during the incubation experiment, whereas N2O fluxes remained constant. At the undrained site, permanently high groundwater level was found to prevent net nitrification, resulting in a limitation of available nitrate (NO3-) and negligible gaseous N losses. N2O flux rates that were up to four times higher were measured in the incubation experiment. They reveal the potential of high N2O losses under changing soil physical conditions at the drained alder sites. The high net nitrification rates observed and high NO3- contents bear the risk of considerable NO3- leaching at the drained sites.

AB Increased use of bioenergy has increased the production of wood ash in power plants. Wood ash is used as a fertilizer to improve tree stand growth in nitrogen-rich peatland forests. Nutrients removed during tree harvest are recycled back to the forest by wood ash fertilization. However, there is a risk that ash enhances microbial processes and associated nitrous oxide (N2O) production in peat. Because there are difficulties in spreading loose ash, ash is nowadays granulated or hardened in other ways before it is applied as fertilizer. Granulation process changes not only the physical but also the chemical properties of ash. In previous studies wood ash has showed variable effects on N2O emissions. Nevertheless, there are indications that in laboratory conditions granulated wood ash decreases N2O production. We conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the capability of granulated wood ash to decrease N2O production in peat soils and the role of nitrification and denitrification in N2O production. Acetylene inhibition experiments showed that N2O production was dominated by nitrification over denitrification. The rate of nitrification as well as N2O production from nitrification and denitrification decreased by the addition of granulated wood ash. Wood ash addition increased peat electrical conductivity while peat pH remained unchanged. The inhibitory effect of ash was associated to ion content because isolated ion addition experiments produced a similar decline in N2O production. The inhibition of ions was more evident in acidic conditions because when peat pH was increased by addition of lime, the ions or granulated ash inhibited N2O production significantly less than they did at natural peat pH. Our results show that manipulation of ion strength could offer a new tool to slow nitrification and denitrification processes and decrease the associated N2O emissions in acidic soils.

AB Microbial enzyme activities were followed during a field-based experimental simulation of the effects of higher rainfall in a Welsh peat land. The treatment did not significantly affect the activities of the carbon cycling enzymes, P-glucosidase, esterase or xylosidase. In contrast, the activity of the enzyme sulphatase decreased by 44% (P < 0.001) in response to the wetter conditions. The manipulation suggests that should climate change cause conditions to become wetter in peatlands, then (with the exception of sulphatase) current levels of wetness may be sufficient to limit decomposition processes, and thus any further increase in wetness is unlikely to induce a further decrease in decomposition rates. Correlations were found between the esterase activity and both nitrous oxide flux (r=-0.34, P<0.05), and methane release (r=0.53, P<0.01). Likewise, there was a correlation between xylosidase activity and both carbon dioxide emission (r=0.52, P<0.01) and aluminium concentration (r=0.58, P<0.01). All of the enzymes correlated positively with dissolved organic carbon (range r=0.53, P<0.01 sulphatase to r=0.61, P<0.001 glucosidase). Together, the correlations lend support to recent hypotheses suggesting that enzymes exert an influence over wetland biogeochemical properties.

ID CARBON; EMISSIONS
AB Cultivated organic soils, which are a large source of CO2 emissions, are of particular interest in the Republic of Ireland where peatlands cover 20 % of the landscape. For accurate accounting and national reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, there is a need to calculate the total land area used for cultivation activity on drained organic soils. Peatlands (organic soils) in Ireland are also used for arable farming, which results in particularly high greenhouse gas emissions per unit area. However, the Irish National Inventory Report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change lacks mention of this type of land use. The actual area of organic soils under arable land use (cropland) in Ireland has, thus far, not been quantified. Here we provide a first estimate of the area of organic soil that is used for arable farming in Ireland. Through map overlay analysis using GIS in combination with probability sampling and ground truthing, we estimate the area of organic soils under arable cropping at 1,235 ha, which is considerably lower than the estimate of 3,688 ha based on map overlays alone. This research provides information to support improved accounting of organic soils under cultivation and may contribute to reducing uncertainty in national reporting of GHG emissions, thus providing a more reliable basis for strategies aimed at reducing GHG emissions in Ireland in the future.

AB Drained peatlands contribute to anthropic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), so a better understanding of the underlying processes and identification of mitigation options for agricultural peatlands are urgently required. Peatland soil properties vary greatly and, in combination with drainage, can affect emissions of CO2 both directly and indirectly. Drainage reduces soil water content but increases CO2 production, so it is important to find the optimum drainage level that minimises CO2 emissions without affecting agricultural use. Intact soil cores from nine different sites (topsoil, plus subsoil at four sites) were collected and brought into a controlled laboratory environment. Repeated measurements of CO2 fluxes were performed at increasing soil water suctions corresponding to different drainage levels. Physical and chemical properties of the soils were determined and compared with the CO2 emissions. The soil cores displayed different CO2 emission patterns with increasing soil water suction head. In some cores, emissions increased rapidly to a high level, while in others they remained at lower levels. At a soil water suction head of only 0.5 m of water, the average soil CO2 emissions had already reached a maximum. The soil cores represented peat soils with a wide range of soil properties, e.g. bulk density from 0.17 to 0.47 g cm(-3) and total carbon from 26.3 to 43.5 %, but none of the properties measured was clearly correlated with CO2 emissions.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were measured fortnightly to monthly with manual chambers in 2004-2008 and hourly with automatic chambers during the snow-free seasons of 2007 and 2008 in a sedge fen in northern Finland. The fluxes were generally low, varying from -45 to 37 mu g N2O-N m(-2) hour(-1) (negative fluxes indicating uptake of N2O from the atmosphere into the soil) and showing large spatial and temporal variation. Slightly higher emissions were observed in winter than in summer. On an annual scale, the fen acted as a N2O source. The annual balances showed a clear decreasing trend from 1.1 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) (= 12.2 mu g N m(-2) hour(-1)) in 2004 to zero balances in 2007 and 2008. Two potential reasons for the decreasing mean flux were (i) a decreasing atmospheric N deposition during the snow-free season, and (ii) a rising water-table level (WTL), which restricts the availability of oxygen in the peat and therefore favours the formation of molecular nitrogen (N-2) instead of N2O by the denitrifying microbes. The measurements conducted with the automatic chambers during the snow-free season showed a positive exponential relationship between the N2O flux and the temperature in 2008, but not in 2007. Similarly, a unimodal relationship with the WTL was found in 2008, with maximum fluxes observed when the WTL was about 4 cm above the fen surface. No diurnal variation in N2O fluxes measured by automatic chambers was found. The fluxes measured by the manual or automatic chambers were similar in magnitude, but different in their temporal pattern. The daily N2O concentration at a depth of 0.15 m in the peat was always lower than the ambient atmospheric concentration, indicating that at this depth the atmospheric N2O was consumed. Together with the observed negative flux rates this suggests that microbial N-2 production is a significant part of the N cycle in this fen.

AB Organic soils are a main source of direct emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), an important greenhouse gas (GHG). Observed N2O emissions from organic soils are highly variable in space and time, which causes high uncertainties in national emission inventories. Those uncertainties could be reduced when relating the upscaling process to a priori-identified key drivers by using available N2O observations from plot scale in empirical approaches. We used the empirical fuzzy modelling approach MODE to identify main drivers for N2O and utilize them to predict the spatial emission pattern of European organic soils. We conducted a meta-study with a total amount of 659 annual N2O measurements, which was used to derive separate models for different land use types. We applied our models to available, spatially explicit input driver maps to upscale N2O emissions at European level and compared the inventory with recently published IPCC emission factors. The final statistical models explained up to 60% of the N2O variance. Our study results showed that cropland and grasslands emitted the highest N2O fluxes 0.98 +/- 1.08 and 0.58 +/- 1.03 gN(2)O-N m(-2) a(-1), respectively. High fluxes from cropland sites were mainly controlled by low soil pH value and deep-drained ground-water tables. Grassland hotspot emissions were strongly related to high amount of N-fertilizer inputs and warmer winter temperatures. In contrast, N2O fluxes from natural peatlands were predominantly low (0.07 +/- 0.27 gN(2)O-N m(-2) a(-1)) and we found no relationship with the tested drivers. The total inventory for direct N2O emissions from organic soils in Europe amount up to 149.5 GgN(2)O-N a(-1), which also included fluxes from forest and peat extraction sites and exceeds the inventory calculated by IPCC emission factors of 87.4 GgN(2)O-N a(-1). N2O emissions from organic soils represent up to 13% of total European N2O emissions reported in the European Union (EU) greenhouse gas inventory of 2011 from only 7% of the EU area. Thereby the model demonstrated that the major part (85 %) of the inventory is induced by anthropogenic management, which shows the significant reduction potential by rewetting and extensification of agriculturally used peat soils.

AB Permafrost in the Arctic is thawing, exposing large carbon and nitrogen stocks for decomposition. Gaseous carbon release from Arctic soils due to permafrost thawing is known to be substantial, but growing evidence suggests that Arctic soils may also be relevant sources of nitrous oxide (N2O). Here we show that N2O emissions from subarctic peatlands increase as the permafrost thaws. In our study, the highest postthaw emissions occurred from bare peat surfaces, a typical landform in permafrost peatlands, where permafrost thaw caused a fivefold increase in emissions (0.56 +/- 0.11 vs. 2.81 +/- 0.6 mg N2O m(-2) d(-1)). These emission rates match those from tropical forest soils, the world's largest natural terrestrial N2O source. The presence of vegetation, known to limit N2O emissions in tundra, did decrease (by similar to 90%) but did not prevent thaw-induced N2O release, whereas waterlogged conditions suppressed the emissions. We show that regions with high probability for N2O emissions cover one-fourth of the Arctic. Our results imply that the Arctic N2O budget will depend strongly on moisture changes, and that a gradual deepening of the active layer will create a strong noncarbon climate change feedback.

AB Constructed wetlands (CW), widely used to remove nutrients from runoff waters, transform some of the carbon and nitrogen they receive into greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), and may therefore have adverse atmospheric impacts. We studied seasonal and temporal changes in C degradation and emissions of CH4 and N2O of a boreal CW used to purify peat mining runoff waters 5 (in 1992) and 15 (in 2001-2002) years after construction. There was a remarkable change in the cycling of carbon in the wetland as the number of years in operation increased: the mean CH4 emission tripled from 140 to 400 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) and the mean CO2 release (respiration) doubled from 7270 to 13 600 mg CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in the 10-year period. The reasons for the increased C gas production were the increased plant biomass, which doubled in 10 years, and a 3 degrees C higher average temperature in 2002 than in 1992. The N2O fluxes did not change during the study period: the mean emissions were 340 and 450 mu g N2O m(-2) d(-1) in 1992 and 2002. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the water column and their exchange at the water/air interface were studied during the open water period in two freshwater ponds with different catchment characteristics in the northern boreal zone in Finland; either peatlands or coniferous upland forests dominated the catchment of the ponds. Both ponds were supersaturated with dissolved CO2 and CH4 with respect to the equilibrium with the atmosphere, but were close to the equilibrium with N2O. The mean CO2 efflux from the pond was higher in the peatland-dominated catchment (22 mg m(-)2 h(-1)) than in the forested catchment (0.7 mg m(-2) h(-1)), whereas the mean CH4 emissions were similar (7.6 and 3.5 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively). The fluxes of N2O were generally negligible. The higher CO2 concentrations and efflux in the pond with the peatland-dominated catchment were attributed to a greater input of allochthonous carbon to that pond from its catchment due to its higher water colour and higher total organic carbon (TOC) concentration. The water pH, which also differed between the ponds, could additionally affect the CO2 dynamics. Since the catchment characteristics can regulate aquatic carbon cycles, catchment-scale studies are needed to attain a deeper understanding of the aquatic greenhouse gas dynamics.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions from managed peatlands have not been extensively studied in Western Patagonia. The objective of this study was to assess the annual CO2 emission from microbial carbon (C) mineralization in a peatland site under not saturated conditions at Tierra del Fuego. The annual CO2 emissions were measured from unsaturated soil samples (n = 41) under soil incubation at seasonal local temperatures to simulate CO2 emissions for a year, using a non-dispersive infrared gas analyser. Spatial models for total soil C and CO2 were calculated using discrete and continuous variables. The annual mean of measured cumulative CO2 was 1,358 mu g CO2 g soil(-1), lower than Northern peatlands, and 82% of the C mineralization occurred in the warmer season. The modelled CO2 in the warmer season showed levels of CO2 as high as 4 mg CO2 g soil(-1), but 66% of the area showed between 600-2000 mu g CO2 g soil(-1), which is 28%-92% and 9%-32% of CO2 values reported for crop rotations. Consequently, after a potential habilitation of the study area for agricultural use, the soil CO2 emissions from heterotrophic activity would become a C source to the global CO2 emissions. This ecosystem is highly exposed to the effects of the land-use change, and global temperature increase.

AB Most countries use a 1-year-resolution emission factor approach (Tier 1 or 2) to estimate terrestrial N2O emissions as part of their national greenhouse gas inventory. Little attention has so far been paid to the effect of the temporal resolution of the approach (e. g., day, season, and year) on N2O emission estimates. The effect of lumping temporal variation can be very large because of daily or seasonal variations of processes causing N2O emissions. Therefore, we compared annual N2O emissions from a model with daily time steps (DNDC) with those of a model with annual time steps (INITIATOR). Emissions were simulated for two intensively managed grassland plots in the Dutch fen meadow landscape. Annual N2O emissions from the investigated grasslands were sensitive to rainfall distribution within the year, especially to summer rainfall. We recommend that Tier 2 N2O emission estimates for intensively managed grasslands on peat soils in the temperate climate zone are adjusted for relative summer rainfall.

AB A Fast Methane Analyzer (FMA) is assessed for its applicability in a closed path eddy covariance field set-up in a peat meadow. The FMA uses off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy combined with a highly specific narrow band laser for the detection of CH4 and strongly reflective mirrors to obtain a laser path length of 2-20x10(3) m. Statistical testing and a calibration experiment showed high precision (7.8x10(-3) ppb) and accuracy (<0.30%) of the instrument, while no drift was observed. The instrument response time was determined to be 0.10 s. In the field set-up, the FMA is attached to a scroll pump and combined with a 3-axis ultrasonic anemometer and an open path infrared gas analyzer for measurements of carbon dioxide and water vapour. The power-spectra and co-spectra of the instruments were satisfactory for 10 Hz sampling rates.
   Due to erroneous measurements, spikes and periods of low turbulence the data series consisted for 26% of gaps. Observed CH4 fluxes consisted mainly of emission, showed a diurnal cycle, but were rather variable over. The average CH4 emission was 29.7 nmol m(-2) s(-1), while the typical maximum CH4 emission was approximately 80.0 nmol m(-2) s(-1) and the typical minimum flux was approximately 0.0 nmol m(-2) s(-1). The correspondence of the measurements with flux chamber measurements in the footprint was good and the observed CH4 emission rates were comparable with eddy covariance CH4 measurements in other peat areas.
   Additionally, three measurement techniques with lower sampling frequencies were simulated, which might give the possibility to measure CH4 fluxes without an external pump and save energy. Disjunct eddy covariance appeared to be the most reliable substitute for 10 Hz eddy covariance, while relaxed eddy accumulation gave reliable estimates of the fluxes over periods in the order of days or weeks.

AB In Hokkaido, the northern part of Japan, degradation of natural wetland is occurring due to invasion of Sasa vegetation associated with construction of drainages. We measured greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes at the Sasa invaded wetland in Bibai, Hokkaido. GHG fluxes at Sphagnum-dominated site (Sp) and Sasa invasion site (Sa) were measured by using a closed chamber method (transparent acryl chamber which covering plants) from July to October 2002. GFIG concentration profiles, air filled porosity, and gas diffusion coefficient (D/D-0) of topsoil were also measured.
   Water table depth was not significantly different between the sites. Air-filled porosity was significantly lower in Sa than in Sp (p = 0.03). D/D-0 was also lower in Sa than in Sp. CH4 emissions (mg C m(-2) hr(-1)) were significantly lower in Sa (2.4 +/- 0.64) than in Sp (3.7 +/- 0.48) (p 0.03), although Sa showed a higher CH4 concentration gradient at ground surface than that of Sp. This might be due to poor gas exchange in Sa. CO2 emissions (mg C m(-2) hr-1) were found in Sa (13 +/- 15), while photosynthetic CO2 uptake were found in Sp (-89 +/- 7.0). This could be due to low ability Of CO2 fixation of Sasa vegetation, because CO2 emission from ground surface was probably lower in Sa than in Sp due to poor soil gas exchange in Sa. N2O fluxes (mg N m(-2) hr(-1)) were 0.010 +/- 0.007 in Sp and 0.00 1 +/- 0.002 in Sa. Therefore, there was no significant difference between the sites (p = 0.16). However, soil N2O concentrations in Sa decreased below the atmospheric N2O concentration, could be due to N2O dissolution into the soil water under poor soil gas exchange condition in Sa.

AB The Zoige peatland on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the largest alpine peatland in the world, is currently experiencing unprecedented water stress due to climate change and human activities. However, the consequences for emissions of greenhouse gases have not been well studied. We conducted a 40-month in situ field experiment (including deep, shallow and control water table treatments) to examine the effect of drainage on greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O). The results showed that drainage significantly increased the emission rates and the total cumulative emissions of CO2 (i.e., ecosystem respiration) and N2O, and reduced CH4 emissions. However, under drained conditions, the cumulative emissions of CO2 and N2O increased significantly during the growing season (May to September) only, whereas the cumulative emissions of CH4 decreased significantly during both the growing season and the non-growing season (October to April). In addition, drainage significantly increased the biomass of aerobic bacteria and methanotrophs. These results indicate that emissions of greenhouse gases in the Zoige peatland are sensitive to short-term drainage and that future studies should consider the response of greenhouse gas fluxes to environmental changes in the non-growing season.

AB Paludiculture is the productive use of wet and rewetted peatlands. A major motivation is climate change, because drained peatlands contribute significant amounts of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The study presents an analysis of paludiculture as a critical sustainability innovation mission in the making. It is based on qualitative interviews conducted in 2018 in the north-east of Germany as well as on subsequent regional and European level stakeholder workshops focused on wet agriculture options for rewetted mires and other types of wetlands. A social grid approach of cognitive frames, institutions and social networks and their interplay is used to analyse paludiculture options for currently drained mires. The analysis suggests a pathway of paludiculture as land use at the margins of intensive, dryland agriculture. It also points to strategies for paludiculture to move from the margin to a transformation pathway, based on the use of framing, institutional conversion and productive niche work. The study proposes a 3Ms-schema of mission, modes and making innovation as a device to create space for a wide and inclusive discussion of paludiculture.

AB Climate warming and vegetation composition change are expected to influence greenhouse gas emissions from boreal peatlands. However, the interactive effects of warming and different vegetation compositions on N2O dynamics are poorly known, although N2O is a very potent greenhouse gas. In this study, manipulated warming and vegetation composition change were conducted in a boreal peatland to investigate the effects on N2O fluxes during the growing seasons in 2015 and 2016. We did not find a significant effect of warming treatment and combination treatments of warming and vegetation composition change on N2O fluxes. However, sedge removal treatment significantly increased N2O emissions by three-fold. Compared with the treatment of shrub and sedge removal, the combined treatment of warming and shrub and sedge removal significantly increased N2O consumption by five-fold. Similar to N2O fluxes, the cumulative N2O flux increased by similar to 3.5 times under sedge removal treatment, but this effect was not significant. In addition, the results showed that total soil nitrogen was the main control for N2O fluxes under combinative treatments of warming and sedge/shrub removal, while soil temperature and dissolved organic carbon were the main controls for N2O release under warming combined with the removal of all vascular plants. Our results indicate that boreal peatlands have a negligible effect on N2O fluxes in the short-term under climate change, and environmental controls on N2O fluxes become increasingly important under the condition of warming and vegetation composition change.

AB Drained riparian wetlands have been rewetted and restored in recent decades to remove nutrients, increase biodiversity, and mitigate soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Yet, few studies have documented the long-term effects of rewetting on complete greenhouse gas (GHG) balances including emissions of CO2, methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Here, we report the complete annual GHG balance of an extensively managed riparian wetland, dominated by creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera), 12 years after rewetting. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 was measured by transparent closed chambers, and fluxes were partitioned into gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) for modelling and extrapolation to annual emissions based on photosynthetically active radiation, ratio vegetation index and temperature. Fluxes of CH4 and N2O were monitored with opaque chambers. Groundwater table (GWT) was close to soil surface for most of the growing period, whereas the site was inundated during winter. Biomass was cut in late summer (8.5 Mg dry weight ha(-1)), but left on-site according to current management in the area. Annual ER (1360 g CO2-Cm-2) exceeded GPP (-1140 g CO2-Cm-2), and the ecosystem was a net source of CO2 with NEE of 220 g CO2-Cm-2 yr(-1). However, fluxes of CH4 (53 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)) dominated the annual GHG balance with 405 g CO2-C-eq m(-2) yr(-1) which contributed 60% to the total GHG balance. Fluxes of N2O were primarily found at times of changing GWT with annual emission of 0.7 g N2O m(-2) (50 g CO2-C-eq m(-2)) equal to 7% of the complete GHG balance. With proper management, rewetting and restoration of wetlands is expected to eventually resume the carbon sink function of natural wetlands, but this was not found in the present study as net fluxes of both CO2 and CH4 were positive. This was mainly attributed to on-site deposition of biomass which apparently stimulated both CO2 and CH4 emissions and partly reduced GPP by acting as a mulch layer. Future studies should focus on managements that increase CO2 uptake and biomass yield, and at the same time reduce CH4 emissions; such managements should avoid on-site deposition of aboveground biomass at rewetted sites.

AB Differences of surface elevation in arctic polygonal landforms cause spatial variation in soil water contents (theta), active layer depths (ALD), and thereby in CO2 and CH4 exchange. Here we test hypotheses in ecosys for topographic controls on CO2 and CH4 exchange in trough, rim, and center features of low- and flat-centered polygons (LCP and FCP) against chamber and eddy covariance (EC) measurements during 2013 at Barrow, Alaska. Larger CO2 influxes and CH4 effluxes were measured with chambers and modeled with ecosys in LCPs than in FCPs and in lower features (troughs) than in higher (rims) within LCPs and FCPs. Spatially aggregated CO2 and CH4 fluxes from ecosys were significantly correlated with EC flux measurements. Lower features were modeled as C sinks (52-56 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and CH4 sources (4-6g C m(-2) yr(-1)), and higher features as near C neutral (-2-15 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and CH4 neutral (0.0-0.1 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Much of the spatial and temporal variations in CO2 and CH4 fluxes were modeled from topographic effects on water and snow movement and thereby on theta, ALD, and soil O-2 concentrations. Model results forced with meteorological data from 1981 to 2015 indicated increasing net primary productivity in higher features and CH4 emissions in some lower and higher features since 2008, attributed mostly to recent rises in precipitation. Small-scale variation in surface elevation causes large spatial variation of greenhouse gas (GHG) exchanges and therefore should be considered in estimates of GHG exchange in polygonal landscapes.

AB Land-use/land-cover change (LULCC) often results in degradation of natural wetlands and affects the dynamics of greenhouse gases (GHGs). However, the magnitude of changes in GHG emissions from wetlands undergoing various LULCC types remains unclear. We conducted a global meta-analysis with a database of 209 sites to examine the effects of LULCC types of constructed wetlands (CWs), croplands (CLs), aquaculture ponds (APs), drained wetlands (DWs), and pastures (PASs) on the variability in CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the natural coastal wetlands, riparian wetlands, and peatlands. Our results showed that the natural wetlands were net sinks of atmospheric CO2 and net sources of CH4 and N2O, exhibiting the capacity to mitigate greenhouse effects due to negative comprehensive global warming potentials (GWPs; -0.9 to -8.7 t CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1)). Relative to the natural wetlands, all LULCC types (except CWs from coastal wetlands) decreased the net CO2 uptake by 69.7%-456.6%, due to a higher increase in ecosystem respiration relative to slight changes in gross primary production. The CWs and APs significantly increased the CH4 emissions compared to those of the coastal wetlands. All LULCC types associated with the riparian wetlands significantly decreased the CH4 emissions. When the peatlands were converted to the PASs, the CH4 emissions significantly increased. The CLs, as well as DWs from peatlands, significantly increased the N2O emissions in the natural wetlands. As a result, all LULCC types (except PASs from riparian wetlands) led to remarkably higher GWPs by 65.4%-2,948.8%, compared to those of the natural wetlands. The variability in GHG fluxes with LULCC was mainly sensitive to changes in soil water content, water table, salinity, soil nitrogen content, soil pH, and bulk density. This study highlights the significant role of LULCC in increasing comprehensive GHG emissions from global natural wetlands, and our results are useful for improving future models and manipulative experiments.

AB Peatlands are widely developed in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but little is known about carbon budgets for these alpine peatland ecosystems. In this study, we used an automatic chamber system to measure ecosystem respiration in the Hongyuan peatland, which is located in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Annual ecosystem respiration measurements showed a typical seasonal pattern, with the peak appearing in June. The highest respiration was 10.43 mu mol CO2/m(2)/s, and the lowest was 0.20 mu mol CO2/m(2)/s. The annual average ecosystem respiration was 2.06 mu mol CO2/m(2)/s. The total annual respiration was 599.98 g C/m(2), and respiration during the growing season (from May to September) accounted for 78 % of the annual sum. Nonlinear regression revealed that ecosystem respiration has a significant exponential correlation with soil temperature at 10-cm depth (R-2 = 0.98). The Q(10) value was 3.90, which is far higher than the average Q(10) value of terrestrial ecosystems. Ecosystem respiration had an apparent diurnal variation pattern in growing season, with peaks and valleys appearing at approximately 14:00 and 10:00, respectively, which could be explainedby soil temperature and soil water content variation at 10-cm depth.

AB The use of unmanned aerial vehicles for detailed mapping of ecosystems has become increasingly important in recent years. As one of the main terrestrial carbon reserves, peatland ecosystems are of the great interest in obtaining highly detailed orthophotoplans. At the same time, there is a lack of publications devoted to the total carbon dioxide fluxes in each type of bog microforms. This paper presents the results of our study, which aimed to develop methods for mapping peatland microlandscapes and for estimation of integral carbon dioxide fluxes between the peatland surface and the atmosphere. Based on a highly detailed orthophotoplan compiled using unmanned aerial vehicles, we assessed the areas of major microform groups (swamps, hollows, and ridges) in a bog located in the Central Forest State Nature Biosphere Reserve (European Russia). The classification accuracy ranged from 79% to 93%. The areas of ridges, hollows, and swamps were 0.16 km(2), 0.32 km(2), and 0.12 km(2), respectively. To make an integral estimation of carbon dioxide fluxes, we used earlier data on carbon dioxide emissions (ecosystem respiration), uptake (gross ecosystem exchange). and balance (net ecosystem exchange) measured by soil chamber method on representative experimental plots of respective microform types. After recalculating fluxes to areas of microforms, the integral values for different classes in the summer seasons of 2014, 2016 and 2017 were 15-91 kg CO2 x h(-1) for ecosystem respiration, 21-190 kg CO(2 )x h(-1) for gross ecosystem exchange, and from -122 kg CO2 x h(-1) to 41 kg CO2 x h(-1) for net ecosystem exchange. The results of the study confirmed that highly detailed orthophotoplans, obtained with the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, make it possible to distinguish the boundaries of such bog microforms as swamps, hollows and ridges with a high accuracy, despite the presence of some errors in the classification. The study of the structural and functional organisation of the bog should be carried out with considering its seasonal and interannual dynamics as well as all microform types.

AB Soils have an important role in the global budgets of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). In particular, peat soils are considered to exhibit relatively high emission rates. The purpose of this study is to make an integrated assessment of the emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O from pasture on drained peat soils in the Netherlands (almost 10% of the total land area). The study is based on monitoring studies, described or to be described in more detail elsewhere, at the experimental farm 'R.O.C. Zegveld'. Besides emissions from the soil-plant part of the system, CO2 emission from cattle and their excreta, and emissions of CH4 and N2O from excreta in grazed pastures were included. The annual fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O were estimated. The estimated net CO2 emission was (11 +/- 3) x 10(3) kg/ha per year, CH4 emissions ranged from -0.3 +/- 0.1 to 0.1 +/- 0.1 kg/ha per year and N2O emissions from 14 +/- 1 to 61 +/- 4 kg/ha per year. By extrapolation we estimated the contribution of the investigated sources on drained pear pastures to the overall national greenhouse gas emission of 244 x 10(9) kg CO2 equivalents/year, assuming that (1) the emissions at the monitored site were representative for the Netherlands, and (2) the uncertainties found in the monitoring studies were the sole sources of uncertainty. The percentage contributions to the overall national greenhouse gas emission were estimated at 1.3 +/- 0.3% for CO2, 0.0% for CH4 and 0.9 +/- 0.1% for N2O. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Peatlands cover a very small area of the Earth, but store globally significant quantities of carbon and export disproportionate quantities of fluvial organic carbon, especially when the peatlands are degraded or disturbed. Peatland headwater catchments with high concentrations of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) provide an opportunity to investigate the possibility of competing effects that could lead to enhanced or diminished turnover of DOC in the presence of POC. Both POC and DOC can be degraded by light and microbes, producing smaller molecules and releasing CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere, and POC can inhibit light penetration, stabilize DOC by providing adsorption sites and providing surfaces for microbes to interact with DOC. However, the majority of peatland fluvial carbon studies are conducted using filtered water samples, and measure only the DOC concentration, so the impact of the particulate organic matter (POM) on in-stream processing of organic carbon is relatively unknown. It is therefore possible that studies have underestimated carbon transformations in rivers as they have not considered the interaction of the particulate material on the dissolved concentrations; there could be higher losses than previously estimated, increasing the contribution of peatland headwaters to GHG emissions. In this study, we assessed if the current approach of DOC degradation studies accurately represent the impact of POM on DOC degradation, by quantifying DOC production from POM, and therefore POC, over time in water with manipulated POM concentrations. Both filtered and unfiltered water lost 60% of the DOC over 70 hours, whereas the treatment with additional POM lost only 35%. The results showed that filtering does not significantly impact the DOC degradation rates; however, when the POC concentration was doubled, there was a significant reduction in DOC degradation, suggesting that filtering would still be necessary to get accurate rates of DOC transformations in waters with high POC concentrations.

ID SMALL-SCALE PRODUCTION; COMPARING LARGE-SCALE
AB The purpose of this study is to describe how the greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits of ethanol from agricultural crops depend on local conditions and calculation methods. The focus is mainly on the fuels used in the ethanol process and biogenic GHG from the soils cultivated. To ensure that "good" ethanol is produced, with reference to GHG benefits, the following demands must be met: (i) ethanol plants should use biomass and not fossil fuels, (ii) cultivation of annual feedstock crops should be avoided on land rich in carbon (above and below ground), such as peat soils used as permanent grassland, etc., (iii) by-products should be utilised efficiently in order to maximise their energy and GHG benefits and (iv) nitrous oxide emissions should be kept to a minimum by means of efficient fertilisation strategies, and the commercial nitrogen fertiliser utilised should be produced in plants which have nitrous oxide gas cleaning. Several of the current ethanol production systems worldwide fullfill the majority of these demands, whereas some production systems do not. Thus, the findings in this paper helps identifying current "good" systems, how today's "fairly good" systems could be improved, and which inherent "bad" systems that we should avoid.

AB This study uses life-cycle assessment (LCA) to compare greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from dominant agricultural land uses, and peat and coal electricity generation, with fuel-chains for Miscanthus and short-rotation-coppice willow (SRCW) electricity. A simple scenario was used as an example, where 30% of peat and 10% of coal electricity generation was substituted with co-fired Miscanthus and SRCW, respectively. Miscanthus and SRCW cultivation were assumed to replace sugar-beet, dairy, beef-cattle and sheep systems. GHG emissions of 1938 and 1346 kg CO2 eq. ha(-1) a(-1) for Miscanthus and SRCW cultivation compared with between 3494 CO2 eq. ha(-1) a(-1) for sugar-beet cultivation and 12,068CO(2)eq.ha(-1)a(-1) for dairy systems. Miscanthus and SRCW fuel chains emitted 0.131 and 0.132 kg CO2 eq. kWh(-1) electricity exported, respectively, compared with 1.150 and 0.990 kg CO2 eq. kWh(-1) electricity exported for peat and coal fuel chains. 1.48 Mt CO2 eq. a(-1) was saved from electricity production, and 0.42 Mt CO2 eq.a(-1) was saved from displaced agriculture and soil C-sequestration. The total reduction of 1-9 Mt CO2 eq.a(-1) represents 2.8% of Ireland's 2004 GHG emissions, but was calculated to require just 1.7% of agricultural land area and displace just 1.2% of the dairy herd (based on conservative Miscanthus and SRCW combustible-yield estimates of 11.7 and 8.81 tha(-1) a(-1) dry matter, respectively). A 50% increase in cultivation emissions would still result in electricity being produced with an emission burden over 80% lower than peat and coal electricity. Lower yield assumptions had little impact on total GHG reductions for the scenario, but required substantially greater areas of land. It was concluded that energy-crop utilisation would be an efficient GHG reduction strategy for Ireland. 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to asses how the variability in carbon gas exchange at the plant community scale affected the C gas exchange estimates at the ecosystem scale in a fen that was homogeneous in a micrometeorological sense, that is, had an even surface topography and plant cover. CO2 and CH4 exchange was measured at the plant community scale with chambers and at the ecosystern scale with the eddy covariance (EC) technique. Community-scale measurements were upscaled to the ecosystem scale by weighting the community-specific estimates by the area of the community. All communities were net CO, sinks and CH4 sources during the growing season, but net ecosystem production (NEP) and CH4 emissions ranged from 21 to 190 g CO2-C m(-2) and from 4.3 to 13 g CH4-C m(-2), respectively, between the communities. The seasonal estimates of NEP and CH4, upscaled to the 200 m radius from the EC tower, were 82 and 7.9 2 CH4-C m(-2). which agreed well with the EC measurements. As the communities differed markedly in their C gas dynamics. their proportions controlled the ecosystem scale estimates. Successful upscaling required detailed knowledge on the proportions and leaf area of the communities.

   TEMPERATURE
AB The most common forest management method in Fennoscandia is rotation forestry, including clear-cutting and forest regeneration. In clear-cutting, stem wood is removed and the logging residues are either removed or left on site. Clear-cutting changes the microclimate and vegetation structure at the site, both of which affect the site's carbon balance. Peat soils with poor aeration and high carbon densities are especially prone to such changes, and significant changes in greenhouse gas exchange can be expected. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and energy fluxes with the eddy covariance method for 2 years (April 2016-March 2018) after clear-cutting a drained peatland forest. We observed a significant rise (23 cm) in the water table level and a large CO2 source (first year: 3086 +/- 148 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1); second year: 2072 +/- 124 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)). These large CO2 emissions resulted from the very low gross primary production (GPP) following the removal of photosynthesizing trees and the decline of ground vegetation, unable to compensate for the decomposition of logging residues and peat. During the second summer (June-August) after the clear-cutting, GPP had already increased by 96% and total ecosystem respiration decreased by 14% from the previous summer. The mean daytime ratio of sensible to latent heat flux decreased after harvesting from 2.6 in May 2016 to 1.0 in August 2016, and in 2017 it varied mostly within 0.6-1.0. In April-September, the mean daytime sensible heat flux was 33% lower and latent heat flux 40% higher in 2017, probably due to the recovery of ground vegetation that increased evapotranspiration and albedo of the site. In addition to CO2 and energy fluxes, we measured methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes with manual chambers. After the clear-cutting, the site turned from a small CH4 sink into a small source and from N2O neutral to a significant N2O source. Compared to the large CO2 emissions, the 100-year global warming potential (GWP100) of the CH4 emissions was negligible. Also, the GWP100 due to increased N2O emissions was less than 10% of that of the CO2 emission change.

AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from arable soils are released to the atmosphere in the form of nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). These soil emissions were measured from three horticultural production systems in Quebec and Ontario, Canada, for the following crops: (1) cranberry production in an artificial bog on sandy soil; (2) tomato production on a conventionally farmed loamy sand soil; and, (3) onion production on an organic soil. In-situ soil N2O, CO2 and CH4 fluxes were measured at each site using the non steady-state static chamber method. Tomato production on the loamy sand and onion production on the organic soils were the greatest producers of soil GHG emissions, with highest global warming potentials of 11,000 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) and 7800 kg CO2-eq ha(-1), respectively. The cranberry crop had the lowest global warming potential (2700 kg CO2-eq ha(-1)). Water management (water table depth, subsurface and surface drip irrigation) had a negligible impact on soil GHG emissions. The main factors influencing the production of N2O were spring thaw, rate and timing of inorganic fertilizers, and precipitation. Soil CO2 fluxes were primarily governed by soil temperature. Soil CH4 fluxes were low, as the soils from all crops were both oxidizing and producing CH4 simultaneously. Production of CH4 increased when the cranberry fields were flooded. Organic and mineral soils produced comparable amounts of soil greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Paludiculture, the cultivation of crops on wet or rewetted agricultural peatlands, sustainably integrates productive land use with the provision of multiple ecosystem services. Paludiculture crops thrive under waterlogged conditions that stimulate nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removal from soil and water and convert serious drainage-induced carbon (C) losses to C sequestration. Nutrient uptake by paludicrops can prevent mobilisation after rewetting and provide opportunities for purification of nutrient-rich water. Uncertainty remains, however, if and to what extent N loading and a subsequent increase in biomass productivity affect nutrient cycling as well as emissions of the potent greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). In this study, we use mesocosms with rewetted peat to investigate the effect of different N sources in surface water on biomass production of Typha latifolia, a typical paludiculture crop, and the emissions of CH4 and N2O. Organic (Azolla filiculoides; urea) or mineral (KNO3 ; NH4NO) N was supplied either a single time (steady state) or repeatedly (pulse) to simulate a total surface water load of 150 kg N ha(-1) . We found that N stimulated aboveground and belowground biomass production and nutrient uptake by T. latifolia. These effects were absent in Azolla treatments. Whereas after two months CH4 emissions arose to substantial amounts (> 10 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1)) in unvegetated mesocosms loaded with organic N, they remained very low (< 1 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1)) in vegetated mesocosms, despite the labile C pool in the extensive belowground biomass and organic N loading. Overall, N2O emissions were close to zero and were only detected episodically after NO(3)(- )loading, irrespective of plant presence. Our findings support that T. latifolia as a paludicrop effectively removes various forms of N and P when harvested, and strongly mitigates CH4 emission after the rewetting of agricultural peat soils compared to unvegetated conditions.

AB Quantifying landscape-scale methane (CH4) fluxes from boreal and arctic regions, and determining how they are controlled, is critical for predicting the magnitude of any CH4 emission feedback to climate change. Furthermore, there remains uncertainty regarding the relative importance of small areas of strong methanogenic activity, vs. larger areas with net CH4 uptake, in controlling landscape-level fluxes. We measured CH4 fluxes from multiple microtopographical subunits (sedge-dominated lawns, interhummocks and hummocks) within an aapa mire in subarctic Finland, as well as in drier ecosystems present in the wider landscape, lichen heath and mountain birch forest. An intercomparison was carried out between fluxes measured using static chambers, up-scaled using a high-resolution landcover map derived from aerial photography and eddy covariance. Strong agreement was observed between the two methodologies, with emission rates greatest in lawns. CH4 fluxes from lawns were strongly related to seasonal fluctuations in temperature, but their floating nature meant that water-table depth was not a key factor in controlling CH4 release. In contrast, chamber measurements identified net CH4 uptake in birch forest soils. An intercomparison between the aerial photography and satellite remote sensing demonstrated that quantifying the distribution of the key CH4 emitting and consuming plant communities was possible from satellite, allowing fluxes to be scaled up to a 100km(2) area. For the full growing season (May to October), similar to 1.1-1.4g CH(4)m(-2) was released across the 100km(2) area. This was based on up-scaled lawn emissions of 1.2-1.5g CH(4)m(-2), vs. an up-scaled uptake of 0.07-0.15g CH(4)m(-2) by the wider landscape. Given the strong temperature sensitivity of the dominant lawn fluxes, and the fact that lawns are unlikely to dry out, climate warming may substantially increase CH4 emissions in northern Finland, and in aapa mire regions in general.

AB Emission via bubbling, i.e. ebullition, is one of the main methane (CH4) emission pathways from wetlands to the atmosphere. Direct measurement of gas bubble formation, growth and release in the peat-water matrix is challenging and in consequence these processes are relatively unknown and are coarsely represented in current wetland CH4 emission models. In this study we aimed to evaluate three ebullition modelling approaches and their effect on model performance. This was achieved by implementing the three approaches in one process-based CH4 emission model. All the approaches were based on some kind of threshold: either on CH4 pore water concentration (ECT), pressure (EPT) or free-phase gas volume (EBG) threshold. The model was run using 4 years of data from a boreal sedge fen and the results were compared with eddy covariance measurements of CH4 fluxes.
   Modelled annual CH4 emissions were largely unaffected by the different ebullition modelling approaches; however, temporal variability in CH4 emissions varied an order of magnitude between the approaches. Hence the ebullition modelling approach drives the temporal variability in modelled CH4 emissions and therefore significantly impacts, for instance, high-frequency (daily scale) model comparison and calibration against measurements. The modelling approach based on the most recent knowledge of the ebullition process (volume threshold, EBG) agreed the best with the measured fluxes (R-2 = 0.63) and hence produced the most reasonable results, although there was a scale mismatch between the measurements (ecosystem scale with heterogeneous ebullition locations) and model results (single horizontally ho-mogeneous peat column). The approach should be favoured over the two other more widely used ebullition modelling approaches and researchers are encouraged to implement it into their CH4 emission models.

AB Horticulture in temperate climate zones is energy intensive and the use of peat as the main ingredient in substrates releases additional GHG emissions during mining and processing. This paper evaluates the environmental impact of the co-production and application of bioenergy and biochar using agricultural and woody feedstock to replace natural gas and peat in horticulture by means of a life cycle analysis (LCA), including the timing of CO2 release and uptake, the decay of peat and biochar and the carbon stability of biochar and peat. Lab-scale data on biochar carbon recalcitrance compared to peat (similar to 80% vs. 40% respectively) indicate that spent biochar-based substrates in soil are a carbon storage tool, The combination of bioenergy replacing fossil energy, biochar replacing peat in substrate and long term storage of the spent biochar in soil, contribute to GHG reductions.

AB Purpose Boreal peat soils comprise about 3% of the terrestrial environments, and when drained, they become sources of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Ammonia oxidation can result in N2O emissions, either directly or by fuelling denitrification, but we know little about the ecology of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) in peat soils. Our aim was to determine temporal alterations in abundance and composition of these communities in a drained and forested peat soil in relation to N2O emissions and ammonia oxidation activity.
   Materials and methods The peat was sampled at three different depths in the upper 0.5 m over a period of 9 months covering two summer and two winter samplings. Community composition and abundance were determined by T-RFLP and quantitative real-time PCR of the bacterial and archaeal amoA genes. Potential ammonia oxidation rates were measured using the chlorate inhibition technique, and in situ N2O emission was determined using chambers.
   Results and discussion The soil parameters displayed little spatial and temporal heterogeneity, which probably explained why there were no depth-related effects on the abundance, composition, or activity of the ammonia oxidizers. In contrast to most terrestrial environments, the AOB dominated numerically over the AOA. Both groups changed in community composition between sampling occasions, although the AOB showed more significant seasonal signatures than the AOA. Temporal changes in abundance were only observed for the AOB, with a decrease in numbers from May to March. Such differences were not reflected by the activity or N2O emissions.
   Conclusions The high ammonium concentrations in the peat soil likely favored the AOB over the AOA, and we hypothesize that they were more active than the AOA and therefore responded to climatic and environmental changes. However, other processes rather than ammonia oxidation were likely responsible for N2O emissions at the site.

AB As potential outcomes of climate change, we examined the effects of environmental warming and drying on instantaneous CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes in three sedge fens situated in the northern and middle boreal zones. Warming was induced by means of open top chambers (OTCs) and drying through drainage via ditching. OTCs raised the air temperature by 0.2-2 degrees C, whereas short-term drainage dropped the water-table level (WTL) by 5-10 cm and long-term drainage by 10-30 cm. The impact of simulated warming was rather negligible as warmer and drier conditions caused net ecosystem exchange (NEE) to decrease only at one of the two mid-boreal sites. Otherwise, the temperature rise alone or paired with WTL drawdown did not alter gas fluxes at any of the sites. Instead, the drainage effect overrode that of warming. Primarily WTL drawdown accounted for the differences in fluxes detected, but this was more apparent at the mid-boreal sites than our northern-boreal one. Notably, the northernmost Lompolojankka sedge fen, which was both the coolest and wettest of the three sites, was least sensitive to temperature rise and drainage; there, only CH4 emissions were affected by WTL drawdown.

AB The clear dependence of N2O production through denitrification on available nitrate (NO3) in soil has been shown in many studies. Since N availability similarly limits the growth of plants, the resource competition with vegetation limits the activity of denitrifying microbes and may consequently moderate the N2O emissions from peatlands. We used NO3 uptake by Eriophorum vaginatum L. as a vegetation competition factor for microbes. The species was selected for the experiment because it has high nutrient use efficiency in low-nutrient conditions and high nutrient uptake efficiency in luxuriant nutrient conditions. We measured gaseous N flux as N2O (end product of denitrifier activity) in a restored peatland in central Finland with acetylene inhibition technique over a growing season from sample plots with varying NO3 addition levels and E. vaginatum cover. The resource competition effects were analysed with a model that used exponential decay dependence of N2O flux on the leaf area of E. vaginatum, and saturating response of N2O flux to NO3 addition level. The model explained the variation in N2O fluxes well (R-2=0.86). The model simulation showed that the increasing nutrient uptake of E. vaginatum decreased the N2O fluxes exponentially. Simultaneously, denitrification appeared to saturate even in conditions with high availability of NO3 and low level of competition by vegetation. Thus, E. vaginatum is an effective competitor for NO3 in sedge-dominated peatlands that controls the availability of NO3- for denitrification, and consequently moderates the N2O emissions from peatlands.

In this paper the main grades of biomass waste are defined. The Kyoto Protocol target on reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and methods of emission estimation are discussed. The available information on methane and nitrous oxide emission factors from different biomass boilers and other sources are collected. At the end we present and discuss the factors of the other gas emissions from recovery boilers, lime kilns and BFB boilers when burning fuel mixture of wood waste, sludge and peat.

AB Recent field studies have shown that there are habitats in the subarctic tundra emitting N2O at exceptionally high rates. In this study, stable isotope techniques were applied to characterize the processes responsible for these high N2O emissions which have been found from bare peat surfaces in permafrost peatlands. The results include the first data on the nitrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of N2O emitted from arctic tundra. The emission-weighted average N-15(bulk) value for N2O of -13.02.0 (meanSD; n=8) from the bare peat surfaces falls within the range of the emission-weighted average values from other natural ecosystems but is distinct from those for managed/agricultural ecosystems. This implies that if in the future, a smaller rate in the overall decreasing trend of N-15(bulk) N2O tropospheric isotopic composition is found, it cannot be attributed only to agricultural N2O emission reductions from mitigation actions but also to soils in natural ecosystems that may be emitting more N2O to the atmosphere due to warmer conditions. The site preference (SP) values from emitted N2O range from -30 parts per thousand to 58 parts per thousand, indicating a temporal shift of microbial production and consumption of N2O during the sampling period. Soil emission SP data suggest that the N2O emission in subarctic tundra are more likely to be produced by nitrifier denitrification in the drier study year, but due to variable published SP values for N2O production processes in soils, this interpretation has to be taken with caution. According to SP values at depth, denitrification was the main N2O production pathway. To better address the usefulness of SP in partitioning microbial mechanisms in soils, further studies in soils mesocosms are required.

AB The effect of drainage and long-term agricultural use of peat soils in the Rostov Lowland (Yaroslavl oblast) on the actual and potential emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide is determined. The sorption of methane and nitrous oxide is studied. Emissions of greenhouse gases from peat soils of different degrees of cultivation are estimated. The highest methane emission is revealed in the uncultivated peat soil (the control variant). The maximum rate of organic matter mineralization as estimated by the intensity of the carbon dioxide emission is seen in the agrogenic peat soil cultivated for 30 years. The maximum denitrification activity is revealed in the buried cultivated peat soil. The main product of the denitrification processes in all the studied soils is represented by molecular nitrogen.

AB A peatland productivity and decomposition parameter database was compiled to estimate parameters for the Canadian Model for Peatlands (CaMP); a module developed by the Canadian Forest Service to address the need for national-scale greenhouse gas emission estimates from peatlands present in the forested area of Canada. Data were compiled for 186 peatland sites from 69 sources. The SITES table contains wetland classification, tree classification, province or state, country, latitude, longitude, and an indication of coordinate accuracy. The NPP ALL table contains annual net primary productivity (NPP; gm(-2)yr(-1)) data for cases where one estimate for NPP was reported for all aboveground vegetation. The NPP SHRUB, NPP MOSS, and NPP HERB SEDGE tables each contain a classification of species (if available) or vegetation layer and their NPP (gm(-2)yr(-1)). The BIOMASS TREE, BIOMASS SHRUB, BIOMASS HERB SEDGE, and BIOMASS MOSS tables each contain a classification of species (if available) or vegetation layer and their standing aboveground biomass (g/m(2)). Shrubs in the NPP SHRUB and BIOMASS SHRUB tables were further classified into low or tall shrubs, and plants in the NPP HERB and BIOMASS HERB tables into herbs or sedges. The DECAY LITTER table contains decomposition parameters for different litter types and contains a classification of the type of decomposition study, study duration, information on experimental treatments, classification of above- or belowground plant parts, plant species, litter classification, root litter diameter, indication of hardwood or softwood, indication of evergreen or non-evergreen, litter bag depth classification, classes for bag placement relative to the water table and relative to the peat surface, water table depth, decay rate (k exponent), and mass loss values for years 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 12, and 23 of a decomposition study. The REFERENCES table contains complete citation information and provides links to the source reference pdf file. This data set is vital to the national Canadian peatland modeling effort and should be useful to other peatland scientists and ecosystem modelers. (c) Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, 2018.

AB Abstract
   Understanding the effects of warming on greenhouse gas feedbacks to climate change represents a major global challenge. Most research has focused on direct effects of warming, without considering how concurrent changes in plant communities may alter such effects. Here, we combined vegetation manipulations with warming to investigate their interactive effects on greenhouse gas emissions from peatland. We found that although warming consistently increased respiration, the effect on net ecosystem CO2 exchange depended on vegetation composition. The greatest increase in CO2 sink strength after warming was when shrubs were present, and the greatest decrease when graminoids were present. CH4 was more strongly controlled by vegetation composition than by warming, with largest emissions from graminoid communities. Our results show that plant community composition is a significant modulator of greenhouse gas emissions and their response to warming, and suggest that vegetation change could alter peatland carbon sink strength under future climate change.

TI SOC Stock Changes and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Following Tropical Land

AB The increasing global demand for vegetable oils has resulted in a significant increase in the area under oil palm in the tropics during the last couple of decades, and this is projected to increase further. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil discourages the conversion of peatlands to oil palm and rubber plantations. However, our understanding of the effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of land use conversion is incomplete, especially for mineral soils under primary forests, secondary forests, rubber and other perennial plantations in the tropics. In this review we synthesised information on SOC stocks and GHG emissions from tropical mineral soils under forest, oil palm and rubber plantations and other agroecosystems across the tropical regions. We found that the largest SOC losses occurred after land use conversion from primary forest to oil palm and rubber plantations. Secondary forest and pasture lands showed lower SOC losses as well as total GHG (CO2, N2O and CH4) emissions when converted to oil palm and rubber plantations. However, due to the limited data available on all three GHG emissions, there remains high uncertainty in GHG emissions estimates, and regional GHG accounting is more reliable. We recommend long-term monitoring of oil palm and other perennial plantations established on tropical mineral soils on different soil types and regions on SOC stock changes and total GHG emissions and evaluate appropriate management practices to optimise production and sustainable economic returns, and minimise environmental impact.

AB Wetlands represent sources or sinks of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). The acidic fen Schloppnerbrunnen emits denitrification derived N2O and is also capable of N2O consumption. Global warming is predicted to cause more extreme weather events in future years, including prolonged drought periods as well as heavy rainfall events, which may result in flooding. Thus, the effects of prolonged drought and flooding events on the abundance, community composition, and activity of fen denitrifiers were investigated in manipulation experiments. The water table in the fen was experimentally lowered for 8 weeks in 2008 and raised for 5.5 months in 2009 on three treatment plots, while three plots were left untreated and served as controls. In situ N2O fluxes were rather unaffected by the drought treatment and were marginally increased by the flooding treatment. Samples were taken before and after treatment in both years. The structural gene markers narG and nosZ were used to assess possible changes in the nitrate reducer and denitrifier community in response to water table manipulations. Detected copy numbers of narG and nosZ were essentially unaffected by the experimental drought and flooding. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) patterns of narG and nosZ were similar before and after experimental drought or experimental flooding, indicating a stable nitrate reducer and denitrifier community in the fen. However, certain TRFs of narG and nosZ transcripts responded to experimental drought or flooding. Nitrate-dependent Michaelis-Menten kinetics were assessed in anoxic microcosms with peat samples taken before and 6 months after the onset of experimental flooding. Maximal reaction velocities vmax were higher after than before flooding in samples from treament but not in those from control plots taken at the same time. The ratio of N2O to N2O + N-2 was lower in soil from treatment plots after flooding than in soil from control plots, suggesting mitigation of N2O emissions by increased N2O-reduction rates after flooding. N2O was consumed to subatmospheric levels in all microcosms after flooding. The collective data indicate that water table manipulations had only minor effects on in situ N2O fluxes, denitrifier abundance, and denitrifier community composition of the acidic fen, while active subpopulations of denitrifiers changed in response to water table manipulations, suggesting functionally redundant subpopulations occupying distinct ecological niches in the fen.

AB We built an automatic chamber system to measure greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange in forested peatland ecosystems. We aimed to build a system robust enough which would work throughout the year and could measure through a changing snowpack in addition to producing annual GHG fluxes by integrating the measurements without the need of using models. The system worked rather well throughout the year, but it was not service free. Gap filling of data was still necessary.
   We observed problems in carbon dioxide (CO2) respiration flux estimation during calm summer nights, when a CO2 concentration gradient from soil/moss system to atmosphere builds up. Chambers greatly overestimated the night-time respiration. This was due to the disturbance caused by the chamber to the soil-moss CO2 gradient and consequent initial pulse of CO2 to the chamber headspace. We tested different flux calculation and measurement methods to solve this problem. The estimated flux was strongly dependent on (1) the starting point of the fit after closing the chamber, (2) the length of the fit, (3) the type of the fit (linear and polynomial), (4) the speed of the fan mixing the air inside the chamber, and (5) atmospheric turbulence (friction velocity, u*). The best fitting method (the most robust, least random variation) for respiration measurements on our sites was linear fitting with the period of 120-240 s after chamber closure. Furthermore, the fan should be adjusted to spin at minimum speed to avoid the pulse-effect, but it should be kept on to ensure mixing. If night-time problems cannot be solved, emissions can be estimated using daytime data from opaque chambers.

AB The photolysis of nitrous acid (HONO) is an important source of OH radical, the key oxidizing agent in the atmosphere. Recently it has been reported that nitrite (NO2-) in boil can also be a source of atmospheric HONO, in addition to the other pathways, e.g. the hydrolysis of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on wet surfaces. However, the production rates of MONO in various soils are unknown. We selected a range of dominant northern acidic soils and showed in microcosm experiments that soils which have the highest nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions (drained peatlands) also have the highest MONO production rates. It is known that in natural peatlands with high water table and in boreal coniferous forest soils, low nitrification activity (microbial production of nitrite and nitrate) limits their N2O production. Low availability of nitrite in these soils is the likely reason also for their low MONO production rates. Lowering of water table of peatlands as a result of drainage or climate change enhances their nitrification activity and N2O/NO production and as shown here also their HONO production. Also nitrogen deposition, or nitrogen fertilization and other land-use practices increasing availability of mineral nitrogen can be expected to enhance HONO emissions from soils.

AB Thaw of frozen peat in discontinuous permafrost zone produces a significant number of thermokarst lakes, which are known to contribute to Green House Gases (GHG) emission in the atmosphere. In palsa peatland of western Siberia, the thermokarst lake formation includes soil subsidences, lichen submergence and peat abrasion, leading to lateral spreading of the lake border, often intensified by ground fires. Mesocosm experiments were conducted during 3 weeks on tWo thermokarst lake waters interacting in 30-L tanks with surface horizon of peat, the dominant ground vegetation (lichen Cladonia sp.) and the ash produced by lichen burning at 450 C. The obtained results allowed a better understanding of physico-chemical factors controlling the enrichment of thermokarst lake water in organic carbon and metals, and evaluating CO2 sequestration/emission potential. The changes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), major element and divalent metal concentration in response to peat and lichen biomass addition were less than a factor of 2 over full duration of the experiment. Iron (Fe) concentration in the lake water decreased by a factor of 2 to 3 after the addition of peat and lichen biomass. The concentration of low-soluble trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates decreased by ca. 30 to 50%, presumably due to their co-precipitation with Fe hydroxide. The dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) in tank with lichen increased by a factor of 5.5 0.5, likely due to respiration of algal component in closed environment Strong enrichment of the lake water in DIC, P, K, Ca, Mg, Si, Al, Ti, Mn, Mo, Rb, As, Sb and U upon the ash addition persisted over full duration of experiments and was significant (p <0.0001) compared to peat and lichen biomass treatments. These elements may serve as indicators of ground fire impact on thermokarst lake water's chemistry. The overall effect of ash leaching on aquatic ecosystems after ground fire of frozen Siberian peatland is predicted to be much stronger than that currently recognized for non-permafrost regions.

AB The aim of this study was to develop and apply an advanced, measurement based method for the estimation of annual CH4 and N2O emissions and thus gain improved understanding on the actual greenhouse gas (GHG) balances of combustion of fossil fuels, peat, biofuels and REF. CH4 and N2O emissions depend strongly on combustion conditions, and therefore the emission factors used in the calculation of annual emissions contain significant uncertainties. Fluidised bed combustion (FBC) has many good properties for combustion of different types of fuels and fuels of varying quality, e.g., biofuels and wastes. Therefore, it is currently increasing its market share. In this study, long term measurements (up to 50 days) were carried out at seven FBC boilers representing different size classes, loadings and fuel mixes. Both decreasing load and increasing share of coal in fuel mix increased N2O emissions. Measurement results from different loading levels were combined with the common loading curves of similar plants in Finland to estimate annual emissions. Based on the results, recommendations for emission factors for the Finnish GHG emission inventory are given. The role of FBC as a potential technology for the utilisation of biofuels and wastes with future GHG reduction requirements is discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

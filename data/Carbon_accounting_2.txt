AB Remote sensing has the potential to provide quantitative spatially explicit hydrological information across northern peatland complexes. This paper details a multi-scale remote sensing approach for assessing the use of Sphagnum mosses as proxy indicators of near-surface hydrology. Several spectral indices developed from the near infra-red (NIR) and shortwave infra-red (SWIR) liquid water absorption bands, as well as a biophysical index can be correlated with measures of near-surface moisture in the laboratory, in the field and from airborne imagery. Data from all platforms revealed similar patterns in the spectral indices in relation to changes in moisture although the strength of correlations was reduced as the spatial scale increased. The rapid collection of temporally and spatially explicit hydrological data means that the technique has potential practical application for environmental managers and peatland scientists at the local scale. The task of up-scaling the technique for use in operational peatland hydrological monitoring to the global scale is challenging but achievable, and requires further investigation into the heterogeneity of near-surface moisture across Sphagnum patches and the application of novel image processing techniques to improve the spatial resolution of currently available satellite imagery.

AB Carbon dioxide evasion from inland waters such as lakes, rivers and streams represents a significant component of the global carbon cycle, yet in many parts of the world, relatively little is known about its source. Radiocarbon dating of aquatic CO2 has the potential to provide new insights into C cycling in the terrestrial-aquatic-atmosphere continuum, and whilst a range of methods are available for the collection of samples for C-14 analysis, they all have limitations or disadvantages (e.g. slow collection rates and potential non-equilibrium). These issues are further compounded in remote field sites. Here, we describe a new method for the field collection of CO2 samples from low-pH waters (pH<7) for radiocarbon analysis, which involves a scaled-up version of the widely used headspace equilibration technique coupled with syringe injection of samples into molecular sieve traps for convenient and stable storage. We present the results of laboratory and field tests to verify this 'super headspace method' and discuss its advantages compared with existing techniques, particularly for sampling in remote locations. This includes its high portability, speed of use and absence of any special sample preservation requirements. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Rewetting combined with biomass crop cultivation (paludiculture) has been proposed as a method for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from drained peatlands. This field experiment compared CO2 fluxes from drained (control) and rewetted experimental plots in a temperate fen under reed canary grass cultivation over two successive years. The annual weighted mean water table depth from soil surface (WTD) during the study period was 9, 3 and 1 cm in control, semi-flooded and flooded plots, respectively. There were no significant effects of WTD treatment on biomass yields. The choice of response model for CO2 fluxes influenced annual estimates of ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary production (GPP), but all models showed that ER and GPP decreased in response to rewetting. The resulting net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2, derived by combining eight ER and eight GPP models, varied widely. For example, NEE (expressed as CO2-C) ranged from -935 to -208 g m(-2) yr(-1) for the flooded plots. One set of ER and GPP models was selected on the basis of statistical criteria and showed insignificant differences in NEE between the three water table treatments (-537 to -341 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)). Treatment effects on CO2 emission factors, calculated as the sum of NEE and C export in harvested biomass (58-242 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)), were similarly insignificant. Thus, the results indicated that varying WTD within this narrow range could influence both ER and GPP without altering the net emissions of CO2.

AB The fluxes of carbon dioxide and energy were measured by the eddy covariance method for four contrasting ecosystems within the Pallas area in northern Finland: Kenttarova spruce forest, open Lompolojanldca wetland, treeless top of Sammaltunturi fell, and Pallasjarvi which is a lake. Clear differences in carbon and energy exchange were found among these ecosystems, in both the instantaneous fluxes and the related longer-term balances. The available solar energy and its partitioning into sensible and latent heat fluxes differed markedly among the sites. The characteristics of the CO2 exchange at individual sites varied in terms of the maximum uptake and emission capacity and the associated responses to environmental drivers. The highest instantaneous fluxes were observed over wetland and forest. The mean annual balance showed a considerable net uptake at the wetland, while the balances of the fell top and the forest were both close to zero. The lake, on the other hand, was estimated to be a relatively large source of carbon dioxide. An upscaling exercise based on the actual land-use map of the surroundings demonstrated the importance of including all the major ecosystems in the landscape CO2 balance.

AB Concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the water column and their exchange at the water/air interface were studied during the open water period in two freshwater ponds with different catchment characteristics in the northern boreal zone in Finland; either peatlands or coniferous upland forests dominated the catchment of the ponds. Both ponds were supersaturated with dissolved CO2 and CH4 with respect to the equilibrium with the atmosphere, but were close to the equilibrium with N2O. The mean CO2 efflux from the pond was higher in the peatland-dominated catchment (22 mg m(-)2 h(-1)) than in the forested catchment (0.7 mg m(-2) h(-1)), whereas the mean CH4 emissions were similar (7.6 and 3.5 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively). The fluxes of N2O were generally negligible. The higher CO2 concentrations and efflux in the pond with the peatland-dominated catchment were attributed to a greater input of allochthonous carbon to that pond from its catchment due to its higher water colour and higher total organic carbon (TOC) concentration. The water pH, which also differed between the ponds, could additionally affect the CO2 dynamics. Since the catchment characteristics can regulate aquatic carbon cycles, catchment-scale studies are needed to attain a deeper understanding of the aquatic greenhouse gas dynamics.

AB Members of the bacterial order Planctomycetales have often been observed in associations with Crustacea. The ability to degrade chitin, however, has never been reported for any of the cultured planctomycetes although utilization of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) as a sole carbon and nitrogen source is well recognized for these bacteria. Here, we demonstrate the chitinolytic capability of a member of the family Gemmataceae, Fimbriiglobus ruber SP5(T), which was isolated from a peat bog. As revealed by metatranscriptomic analysis of chitin-amended peat, the pool of 16S rRNA reads from F. ruber increased in response to chitin availability. Strain SP5(T) displayed only weak growth on amorphous chitin as a sole source of carbon but grew well with chitin as a source of nitrogen. The genome of F. ruber SP5(T) is 12.364 Mb in size and is the largest among all currently determined planctomycete genomes. It encodes several enzymes putatively involved in chitin degradation, including two chitinases affiliated with the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family GH18, GH20 family beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and the complete set of enzymes required for utilization of GlcNAc. The gene encoding one of the predicted chitinases was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the endochitinase activity of the recombinant enzyme was confirmed. The genome also contains genes required for the assembly of type IV pili, which may be used to adhere to chitin and possibly other biopolymers. The ability to use chitin as a source of nitrogen is of special importance for planctomycetes that inhabit N-depleted ombrotrophic wetlands.
   IMPORTANCE Planctomycetes represent an important part of the microbial community in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands, but their potential functions in these ecosystems remain poorly understood. This study reports the presence of chitinolytic potential in one of the recently described peat-inhabiting members of the family Gemmataceae, Fimbriiglobus ruber SP5(T). This planctomycete uses chitin, a major constituent of fungal cell walls and exoskeletons of peat-inhabiting arthropods, as a source of nitrogen in N-depleted ombrotrophic Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. This study reports the chitin-degrading capability of representatives of the order Planctomycetales.

AB Peatland headwater streams are consistently supersaturated with respect to gaseous C and are known to degas CO2 and CH4 directly to the atmosphere. Using a combination of injection of a purposeful gas tracer (propane) and a soluble tracer (NaCl) we carried out 49 measurements of the gas transfer coefficient on 12 representative stream reaches to quantify the gas transfer rates of CO2 and CH4 in headwater (1st-3rd order) streams draining six UK peatlands. These were compared to measured stream reach physical variables, such as discharge and water travel time. Whilst we found that evasion rates were highly variable in space and time, (gas transfer coefficient of CO2) was positively related to discharge. Individual study sites showed a high degree of variability in gas transfer rates; at all 49 sites median/mean values for were 0.087/0.157 and 0.092/0.176 min(-1). Median/mean instantaneous CO2 and CH4 evasion rates were 133/367 and 0.22/1.45 mu g C m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Methane evasion rates were therefore more than two orders of magnitude lower than CO2, with CH4 invasion (rather than evasion) measured on 37 % of occasions. Our gas flux measurements from peatland headwater streams are higher than values previously used to estimate landscape scale fluxes and emphasise the importance of the evasion flux term in the overall carbon balance.

AB In the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, fluxes of water, energy, and carbon determine the water and carbon balance of peat bogs. We used eddy covariance (EC) measurements to study surface atmosphere exchange and its drivers above an ombrotrophic peat bog (Odersprungmoor) in the Harz Mountains, Germany, with nonideal measurement conditions during the growing season in 2013. For montane peatlands, only very few EC flux measurements exist due to site constraints, for example, surface slope, limited fetch, and frequent dew formation on open path sensors. The measured data were carefully filtered resulting in valid and representative fluxes for the bog. The evapotranspiration (ET) was further characterized by determining the adjusted crop coefficient (K-c*) for July and August and comparing it with K-c* values from 7 years of the FLUXNET site Mer Bleue bog, Ontario, Canada. While soil moisture was taken into consideration, the adjustment was nevertheless necessary as plant health and nutrient supply were not evaluated as required by FAO guidelines. Actual ET at OM was well described by the K-c* model (K-c* = 0.85, R-2 = 0.85). The primary control on ET was available energy and atmospheric conditions and, marginally, the soil moisture conditions. This K-c* value is comparable to the calculated K-c* values for MB, which ranged between 0.82 and 0.86 (R-2 between 0.84 and 0.97). Since these K-c* ranges are narrow for the different sites and years, we hypothesize that these values are good estimates for the true crop coefficients of Sphagnum-dominated peat bogs.

AB This study deals with changes in the plant cover and its net carbon sequestration over 30 years on a subarctic Sphagnum-mire with permafrost near Abisko, northernmost Sweden, in relation to climatic variations during the same period. Aerial colour infrared images from 1970 and 2000 were compared to reveal changes in surface structure and vegetation over the whole mire, while the plant populations were studied within a smaller, mainly ombrotrophic part. The results demonstrated two processes, namely (1) that wet sites dominated by graminoids expanded while hummock sites dominated by dwarf shrubs receded, and (2) that on the hummocks lichens expanded while evergreen dwarf shrubs and mosses decreased, both processes creating an instability in the surface structure. A successive degradation of the permafrost is the likely reason for the increase in wet areas, while the changes in the hummock vegetation might have resulted from higher spring temperatures giving rise to an intensified snow melt, exposing the vegetation to frost drought. Because of the vegetation changes, the annual litter input of carbon to the mire has increased slightly, by 4 g m(-2) a(-1) (7.3%), over these years while an increased erosion has resulted in a loss of 40-80 Mg carbon or 7-17 g m(-2) a(-1) for the entire mire over the same period. As the recalcitrant proportion of the litter has decreased, the decay rate in the acrotelm might be expected to increase in the future.

AB Strong climate warming is predicted at higher latitudes this century, with potentially major consequences for productivity and carbon sequestration. Although northern peatlands contain one-third of the world's soil organic carbon, little is known about the long-term responses to experimental climate change of vascular plant communities in these Sphagnum-dominated ecosystems. We aimed to see how long-term experimental climate manipulations, relevant to different predicted future climate scenarios, affect total vascular plant abundance and species composition when the community is dominated by mosses. During 8 years, we investigated how the vascular plant community of a Sphagnum fuscum-dominated subarctic peat bog responded to six experimental climate regimes, including factorial combinations of summer as well as spring warming and a thicker snow cover. Vascular plant species composition in our peat bog was more stable than is typically observed in (sub)arctic experiments: neither changes in total vascular plant abundance, nor in individual species abundances, Shannon's diversity or evenness were found in response to the climate manipulations. For three key species (Empetrum hermaphroditum, Betula nana and S. fuscum) we also measured whether the treatments had a sustained effect on plant length growth responses and how these responses interacted. Contrasting with the stability at the community level, both key shrubs and the peatmoss showed sustained positive growth responses at the plant level to the climate treatments. However, a higher percentage of moss-encroached E. hermaphroditum shoots and a lack of change in B. nana net shrub height indicated encroachment by S. fuscum, resulting in long-term stability of the vascular community composition: in a warmer world, vascular species of subarctic peat bogs appear to just keep pace with growing Sphagnum in their race for space. Our findings contribute to general ecological theory by demonstrating that community resistance to environmental changes does not necessarily mean inertia in vegetation response.

AB Northern peatlands are recognized as globally important stores of terrestrial carbon (C), yet we have limited understanding of how global changes, including land use, affect C cycling processes in these ecosystems. Making use of a long-term (> 50 year old) peatland land management experiment in the UK, we investigated, using a (CO2)-C-13 pulse chase approach, how managed burning and grazing influenced the short-term uptake and cycling of C through the plant-soil system. We found that burning affected the composition and growth stage of the plant community, by substantially reducing the abundance of mature ericoid dwarf-shrubs. Burning also affected the structure of the soil microbial community, measured using phospholipid fatty acid analysis, by reducing fungal biomass. There was no difference in net ecosystem exchange of CO2, but burning was associated with an increase in photosynthetic uptake of (CO2)-C-13 and increased transfer of C-13 to the soil microbial community relative to unburned areas. In contrast, grazing had no detectable effects on any measured C cycling process. Our study provides new insight into how changes in vegetation and soil microbial communities arising from managed burning affect peatland C cycling processes, by enhancing the uptake of photosynthetic C and the transfer of C belowground, whilst maintaining net ecosystem exchange of CO2 at pre-burn levels.

AB Sphagnum mosses are the keystone species of peatland ecosystems. With rapid rates of climate change occurring in high latitudes, vast reservoirs of carbon accumulated over millennia in peatland ecosystems are potentially vulnerable to rising temperature and changing precipitation. We investigate the seasonal drivers of Sphagnum gross primary production (GPP)the entry point of carbon into wetland ecosystems. Continuous flux measurements and flux partitioning show a seasonal cycle of Sphagnum GPP that peaked in the late summer, well after the peak in photosynthetically active radiation. Wavelet analysis showed that water table height was the key driver of weekly variation in Sphagnum GPP in the early summer and that temperature was the primary driver of GPP in the late summer and autumn. Flux partitioning and a process-based model of Sphagnum photosynthesis demonstrated the likelihood of seasonally dynamic maximum rates of photosynthesis and a logistic relationship between the water table and photosynthesizing tissue area when the water table was at the Sphagnum surface. The model also suggested that variability in internal resistance to CO2 transport, a function of Sphagnum water content, had minimal effect on GPP. To accurately model Sphagnum GPP, we recommend the following: (1) understanding seasonal photosynthetic trait variation and its triggers in Sphagnum; (2) characterizing the interaction of Sphagnum photosynthesizing tissue area with water table height; (3) modeling Sphagnum as a soil layer for consistent simulation of water dynamics; and (4) measurement of Sphagnum canopy properties: extinction coefficient (k), clumping (), and maximum stem area index (SAI).

AB Acidic peat bog soils produce CH4 and although molecular biological studies have demonstrated the presence of diverse methano-genic populations in them, few studies have sustained methanogenesis by adding the CH4 precursors H-2/CO2 or acetate, and few indigenous methanogens have been cultured. McLean Bog is a small (ca. 70 m across), acidic (pH 3.4-4.3) Sphagnum-dominated bog in upstate New York. Although addition of H-2/CO2 or 10 mM acetate stimulated methanogenesis in soils from a nearby circumneutral-pH fen, neither of these substrates led to sustained methanogenesis in McLean Bog soil slurries. After a brief period of stimulation by H-2/CO2, methanogenesis in McLean Bog soil declined, which could be attributed to buildup of large amounts of acetic acid produced from the H-2/CO2 by acetogens. Addition of the antibiotic rifampicin inhibited acetogenesis (carried out by Bacteria) and allowed methanogenesis (carried out by Archaea) to continue. Using rifampicin, we were able to study effects of temperature, pH, and salts on methanogenesis from H-2/CO2 in McLean Bog soil samples. The enriched H-2/CO2-utilizing methanogens showed an optimum for activity near pH 5, and a temperature optimum near 35degreesC. Methanogenesis was not stimulated by addition of 10 mM acetate, but it was stimulated by 1 mM acetate, and multiple additions were consumed at increasing rates and nearly stoichiometrically converted to CH4. In conclusion, we have found that both hydrogentrophic and aceticlastic methanogens are present in McLean Bog soils, and that methanogenic activity can be stimulated using H-2/CO2 in the presence of rifampicin, or using low concentrations of acetate.

Nodal explants were grown in vitro on medium with 2 mu M zeatin and either glucose, sorbitol, or sucrose at a concentration of 0, 10, 20, or 30 g l(-1). The interactive effects of carbohydrate type and concentration and genotype were important for shoot proliferation. The best response was afforded by sucrose at 20 g l(-1) both in terms of explant response and shoot developing potential, although glucose supported shoot growth equally well, and in 'NL1' at 10 g l(-1) it resulted in better in vitro growth than sucrose. Carbohydrate concentration had little effect on shoot vigor. The genotypes differed in terms of shoots per explant, length, and vigor, leaves per shoot, and callus formation at the base of explants; this was manifested with various types and concentrations of carbohydrate. Changing the positioning of explants on the medium from vertically upright to horizontal increased the shoot and callus size, but decreased shoot height and leaves per shoot. Proliferated shoots were rooted on a peat:perlite (1:1, v/v) medium and the plantlets were acclimatized and eventually established in the greenhouse.

AB Radiocarbon dating has the capacity to significantly improve our understanding of the aquatic carbon cycle. In this study we used a new passive sampler to measure the radiocarbon (C-14) and stable carbon (delta C-13) isotopic composition of dissolved CO2 for the first time in a peatland stream throughout a complete year (May 2010-June 2011). The in-stream sampling system collected time-integrated samples of CO2 continuously over approximately 1 month periods. The rate of CO2 trapping was proportional to independently measured streamwater CO2 concentrations, demonstrating that passive samplers can be used to estimate the time-averaged dissolved CO2 concentration of streamwater. While there was little variation and no clear trend in delta(CO2)-C-13 values (suggesting a consistent CO2 source), we found a clear temporal pattern in the C-14 concentration of dissolved CO2. The C-14 age of CO2 varied from 707 +/- 35 to 1210 +/- 39 years BP, with the youngest CO2 in the autumn and oldest in spring/early summer. Mean stream discharge and C-14 content of dissolved CO2 were positively correlated. We suggest that the observed pattern in the C-14 content of dissolved CO2 reflects changes in its origin, with older carbon derived from deeper parts of the peat profile contributing proportionally more gaseous carbon during periods of low stream flow.

AB Recent advances in meta-omics and particularly metatranscriptomic approaches have enabled detailed studies of the structure and function of microbial communities in many ecosystems. Molecular analyses of peat soils, ecosystems important to the global carbon balance, are still challenging due to the presence of coextracted substances that inhibit enzymes used in downstream applications. We sampled layers at different depths from two high-Arctic peat soils in Svalbard for metatranscriptome preparation. Here we show that enzyme inhibition in the preparation of metatranscriptomic libraries can be circumvented by linear amplification of diluted template RNA. A comparative analysis of mRNA-enriched and nonenriched metatranscriptomes showed that mRNA enrichment resulted in a 2-fold increase in the relative abundance of mRNA but biased the relative distribution of mRNA. The relative abundance of transcripts for cellulose degradation decreased with depth, while the transcripts for hemicellulose debranching increased, indicating that the polysaccharide composition of the peat was different in the deeper and older layers. Taxonomic annotation revealed that Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominating polysaccharide decomposers. The relative abundances of 16S rRNA and mRNA transcripts of methanogenic Archaea increased substantially with depth. Acetoclastic methanogenesis was the dominating pathway, followed by methanogenesis from formate. The relative abundances of 16S rRNA and mRNA assigned to the methanotrophic Methylococcaceae, primarily Methylobacter, increased with depth. In conclusion, linear amplification of total RNA and deep sequencing constituted the preferred method for metatranscriptomic preparation to enable high-resolution functional and taxonomic analyses of the active microbiota in Arctic peat soil.

AB Boreal peatlands store large amounts of carbon, reflecting their important role in the global carbon cycle. The short-term exchange and the long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in these ecosystems are closely associated with the permanently wet surface conditions and are susceptible to drought. Especially, the single most important peat forming plant genus, Sphagnum, depends heavily on surface wetness for its primary production. Changes in rainfall patterns are expected to affect surface wetness, but how this transient rewetting affects net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) remains unknown. This study explores how the timing and characteristics of rain events during photosynthetic active periods, that is daytime, affect peatland NEE and whether rain event associated changes in environmental conditions modify this response (e.g. water table, radiation, vapour pressure deficit, temperature). We analysed an 11-year time series of half-hourly eddy covariance and meteorological measurements from Degero Stormyr, a boreal peatland in northern Sweden. Our results show that daytime rain events systematically decreased the sink strength of peatlands for atmospheric CO2. The decrease was best explained by rain associated reduction in light, rather than by rain characteristics or drought length. An average daytime growing season rain event reduced net ecosystem CO2 uptake by 0.23-0.54gCm(-2). On an annual basis, this reduction of net CO2 uptake corresponds to 24% of the annual net CO2 uptake (NEE) of the study site, equivalent to a 4.4% reduction of gross primary production (GPP) during the growing season. We conclude that reduced light availability associated with rain events is more important in explaining the NEE response to rain events than rain characteristics and changes in water availability. This suggests that peatland CO2 uptake is highly sensitive to changes in cloud cover formation and to altered rainfall regimes, a process hitherto largely ignored.

AB Permafrost covers 25% of the land surface in the northern hemisphere, where mean annual ground temperature is less than 0degreesC. A 1.4-5.8 degreesC warming by 2100 will likely change the sign of mean annual air and ground temperatures over much of the zones of sporadic and discontinuous permafrost in the northern hemisphere, causing widespread permafrost thaw. In this study, I examined rates of discontinuous permafrost thaw in the boreal peatlands of northern Manitoba, Canada, using a combination of tree-ring analyses to document thaw rates from 1941-1991 and direct measurements of permanent benchmarks established in 1995 and resurveyed in 2002. I used instrumented records of mean annual and seasonal air temperatures, mean winter snow depth, and duration of continuous snow pack from climate stations across northern Manitoba to analyze temporal and spatial trends in these variables and their potential impacts on thaw. Permafrost thaw in central Canadian peatlands has accelerated significantly since 1950, concurrent with a significant, late-20th-century average climate warming of +1.32 degreesC in this region. There were strong seasonal differences in warming in northern Manitoba, with highest rates of warming during winter (+1.39 degreesC to +1.66 degreesC) and spring (+0.56 degreesC to +0.78 degreesC) at southern climate stations where permafrost thaw was most rapid. Projecting current warming trends to year 2100, I show that trends for north-central Canada are in good agreement with general circulation models, which suggest a 4-8 degreesC warming at high latitudes. This magnitude of warming will begin to eliminate most of the present range of sporadic and discontinuous permafrost in central Canada by 2100.

AB Accurate estimation of CH4 fluxes in alpine peatland of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau under extreme drought is vital for understanding the global carbon cycle and predicting future climate change. However, studies on the impacts of extreme drought on peatland CH4 fluxes are limited. To study the effects of extreme drought on CH4 fluxes of the Zoige alpine peatland ecosystem, the CH4 fluxes during both extreme drought treatment (D) and control treatment (CK) were monitored using a static enclosed chamber in a control platform of extreme drought. The results showed that extreme drought significantly decreased CH4 fluxes in the Zoige alpine peatland by 31.54% (P < 0 :05). Extreme drought significantly reduced the soil water content (SWC) (P < 0 :05), but had no significant effect on soil temperature (Ts). Under extreme drought and control treatments, there was a significant negative correlation between CH4 fluxes and environmental factors (Ts and SWC), except Ts, at a depth of 5cm (P < 0 :05). Extreme drought reduced the correlation between CH4 fluxes and environmental factors and significantly weakened the sensitivity of CH4 fluxes to SWC (P < 0:01). Moreover, it was found that the correlation between subsoil (20 cm) environmental factors and CH4 fluxes was higher than with the topsoil (5, 10 cm) environmental factors under the control and extreme drought treatments. These results provide a better understanding of the extreme drought effects on CH4 fluxes of alpine peatland, and their hydrothermal impact factors, which provides a reliable reference for peatland protection and management.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production, consumption, and quality displayed differences after long-term (similar to 55years) hydrological alterations in a poor fen peatland in northern Michigan. The construction of an earthen levee resulted in areas of a raised and lowered water table (WT) relative to an unaltered intermediate WT site. The lowered WT site had greater peat aeration and larger seasonal vertical WT fluctuations that likely elevated peat decomposition and subsidence with subsequent increases in bulk density, vertical hydraulic gradient, decreased hydraulic conductivity (K-sat), and a greater pore water residence time relative to the unaltered site. The raised WT site displayed a decreased K-sat combined with seasonal upwelling events that contributed to a longer residence time in comparison to the unaltered site. These differences are potentially contributing to elevated DOC concentrations at the lowered and raised WT site relative to the unaltered site. Additionally, spectrophotometric indices and chemical constituent assays indicated that the lowered site DOC was more aromatic and contained elevated concentrations of phenolics compared to the intermediate site. The raised site DOC was less aromatic, less humified, and also had a greater phenolic content than the intermediate site. Furthermore, an incubation experiment showed that DOC in the raised site contained the greatest labile carbon source. Based on our results, long-term WT alterations will likely impose significant effects on DOC dynamics in these peatlands; however, WT position alone was not a good predictor of DOC concentrations, though impoundment appears to produce a more labile DOC whereas drainage increases DOC aromaticity.

AB Shifts in oxic and anoxic conditions in soil are most frequently caused by water table fluctuations, heavy rain, snowmelt or flooding, with potentially significant impacts on microbial processes and the ability of soils to convert mineral nitrogen to nitrogen gases efficiently. The impact of oxic/anoxic cycles on nitrogen transformation rates was therefore explored in the upper layer (0-30 cm) of partially degraded peat soil. We hypothesized that high denitrification potential would be conserved due to the high organic matter content of this soil. Mineral nitrogen was applied to approximately 1-cm deep layers of homogenized soil in microcosms, with no external source of readily degradable carbon. Microcosms were subjected to three cycles, each consisting of an oxic phase of 8-11 days and an anoxic phase of 21-28 days. Approximately 2% of the ammonium load was lost through ammonia volatilization during oxic phases and the remainder was nitrified. The accumulated nitrate decreased soil pH from 8.0 to 6.8 before its transformation through denitrification. Nitrification and denitrification rates during the three oxic/anoxic cycles (approximately three months) were 2.9-3.2 kg N ha(-1) d(-1) and 1.0-2.3 kg N ha(-1) d(-1), respectively. Extrapolation of these values to 30-cm deep soil layers gave rates that were sufficient for complete transformation of at least 1700 kg N ha(-1) of ammonium to nitrogen gases, which is ten-fold greater than the annual nitrogen application of 170 kg N ha(-1) permitted by the European directive. Denitrification rates decreased linearly during the three cycles (from 36 +/- 2 to 16 +/- 1 mu g N g(-1) d(-1) dry soil), projecting cessation of denitrification activity and CO2 production during the fifth cycle. Storage of peat soil at 4 degrees C most probably allowed slow degradation of organic matter that was completely oxidized to CO2 after the soil was exposed to higher temperature (28 degrees C). Storage of soil for one year did not affect nitrification rate, but reduced denitrification rate, unless soil was amended with a readily degradable carbon source. The data suggest that, despite the high carbon content of this soil, it cannot sustain transformations of high N loads to nitrogen gases for prolonged periods without amendment with readily available carbon.

AB The Western Siberia Lowland (WSL), the world's largest permafrost peatland, is of importance for understanding the high-latitude carbon (C) cycle and its response to climate change. Warming temperatures increase permafrost thaw and production of greenhouse gases. Also, permafrost thaw leads to the formation of lakes which are hotspots for atmospheric C emissions. Although lakes occupy similar to 6% of WSL, lake C emissions from WSL remain poorly quantified. Here we show high C emissions from lakes across all permafrost zones of WSL. The C emissions were especially high in shoulder seasons and in colder permafrost-rich regions. The total C emission from permafrost-affected lakes of WSL equals similar to 12 +/- 2.6 Tg C yr(-1) and is 2-times greater than region's C export to the Arctic coast. The results show that C emission from WSL lakes is a significant component in the high-latitude C cycle, but also suggest that C emission may decrease with warming.

AB About 60% of the European wetlands are located in the European part of Russia. Nevertheless, data on methane emissions from wetlands of that area are absent. Here we present results of methane emission measurements for two climatically different years from a boreal peatland complex in European Russia. Winter fluxes were well within the range of what has been reported for the peatlands of other boreal regions before, but summer fluxes greatly exceeded the average range of 5-80 mgCH(4) m(-2) d(-1) for the circumpolar boreal zone. Half of the measured fluxes ranged between 150 and 450 mgCH(4) m (2) d (1). Extrapolation of our data to the whole boreal zone of European Russia shows that theses emissions could amount to up to 2.7 +/- 1.1 TgCH(4) a(-1), corresponding to 69% of the annual emissions from European wetlands or 33% of the total annual natural European methane emission. In 2008, climatic conditions corresponded to the long term mean, whereas the summer of 2011 was warmer and noticeably drier. Counterintuitively, these conditions led to even higher CH4 emissions, with peaks up to two times higher than the values measured in 2008. As Russian peatlands dominate the areal extend of wetlands in Europe and are characterized by very high methane fluxes to the atmosphere, it is evident, that sound European methane budgeting will only be achieved with more insight into Russian peatlands.

AB Carbon flux models that are largely driven by remotely sensed data can be used to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP) over large areas, but despite the importance of peatland ecosystems in the global carbon cycle, relatively little attention has been given to determining their success in these ecosystems. This paper is the first to explore the potential of chlorophyll-based vegetation index models for estimating peatland GPP from satellite data. Using several years of carbon flux data from contrasting peatlands, we explored the relationships between the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) and GPP, and determined whether the inclusion of environmental variables such as PAR and temperature, thought to be important determinants of peatland carbon flux, improved upon direct relationships. To place our results in context, we compared the newly developed GPP models with the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) GPP product. Our results show that simple MTCI-based models can be used for estimates of interannual and intra-annual variability in peatland GPP. The MTCI is a good indicator of GPP and compares favorably with more complex products derived from the MODIS sensor on a site-specific basis. The incorporation of MTCI into a light use efficiency type model, by means of partitioning the fraction of photosynthetic material within a plant canopy, shows most promise for peatland GPP estimation, outperforming all other models. Our results demonstrate that satellite data specifically related to vegetation chlorophyll content may ultimately facilitate improved quantification of peatland carbon flux dynamics.

AB Northern hemisphere peatlands are substantial carbon stores. However, recent climate change and human impacts (e.g., drainage and atmospheric nutrient deposition) may trigger the emission of their stored carbon to the atmosphere. Biodiversity losses are also an important consequence of those changes. Therefore, there is a need to recognise these processes in space and time. Global change experiments are often conducted to improve our understanding of the potential responses of various ecosystems to global warming and drought. Most of the experiments carried out in peatlands are focused on carbon balance and nitrogen deposition. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how fast peatlands respond to temperature changes and water-table lowering in the continental climate setting. This is important because continental regions account for a significant proportion of all northern hemisphere peatlands. A combination of short-term and long-term approaches in a single research project is especially helpful because it facilitates the correct interpretation of experimental data. Here we describe the CLIMPEAT project - a manipulative field experiment in a Sphagnum-dominated peatland supported by a high-resolution multi-proxy palaeoecological study. The design of the field experiment (e.g., treatments), methodology and biogeographical setting are presented. We suggest it is beneficial to support field experiments with an investigation of past environmental changes in the studied ecosystem, as human impacts during the past 300 years have already caused substantial changes in ecosystem functioning which may condition the response in experimental studies.

AB Climate change due to elevated carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere presents a long-term threat to the biosphere. The contribution of soil oxidation to global carbon dioxide levels is of growing concern. Until the past century, for over five millennia, the Everglades has been accreting peat soils and acting as a carbon sink. Anthropogenic drainage of the northernmost one-fourth of the Everglades, one of the largest deposits of organic soils in North America, began in the 1880s. Subsequently, the peat soils of that area began subsiding and releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. We quantified subsidence and CO2 evolution at the regional scale by calculating the changes in peat volume using surface maps reconstructed from historical and current data. The estimated peat volume was originally about 7 x 10(9) m(3) and is currently about 3 x 10(9) m(3). The average subsidence was about two meters and the CO2 emitted was 4.9 x 10(8) metric tons. Assuming a constant CO2 emission rate during the century since drainage, then the regional scale CO2 flux rate from this study (0.2 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)) was similar to short-term, small-scale measurements made under controlled conditions (0.2-6 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)).

AB Northern peatlands are a globally significant carbon (C) reservoir, yet also function as dynamic methane (CH4) sources to the atmosphere. The fate of peatland C stores and related climate system feedbacks remain uncertain under scenarios of a changing climate and enhanced anthropogenic pressure. Here, we present a synthesis of Holocene peatland C dynamics for the Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL), Canada, in relation to the past atmospheric CH4 trends, glacial isostatic adjustment, and paleoclimate. We report that peatland age and trophic status, together with paleoclimate, contribute to explaining some of the temporal variation in C accumulation rates (CARs) in the HBL. Our results show that younger, minerotrophic peatlands accumulate C faster, and although detailed paleoclimate data are not available, the results suggest the possibility of higher CARs in association with warmer Holocene climates. Peat initiation rates and CARs were greatest during the mid-Holocene; however, our results reveal that two-thirds of the HBL C pool is stored in peat of late Holocene age, owing to long-term peatland expansion and development. Whereas the HBL has been a net C sink since mid-Holocene peat initiation, the HBL also appears to have been a modest C source, with 85% of the losses occurring during the late Holocene as a consequence of the gradual decay of previously accrued peat. Late Holocene peat decay, under wetter climatic conditions, and from a landscape occupied by an abundance of minerotrophic peatlands, indicates that the HBL may have been a natural terrestrial source of CH4 to the late Holocene atmosphere. While the peatlands of the HBL may continue to function as a globally significant C store, ongoing C losses from the HBL may have important implications for the global C budget and climate system.

AB We evaluated the spatial heterogeneity of historical carbon accumulation rates in a forested, ombrotrophic bog in Minnesota to aid understanding of responses to an ongoing decade-long warming manipulation. Eighteen peat cores indicated that the bog has been accumulating carbon for over 11,000 years, to yield 176 +/- 40 kg C m(-2) to 225 +/- 58 cm of peat depth. Estimated peat basal ages ranged from 5100 to 11,100 cal BP. The long-term apparent rate of carbon accumulation over the entire peat profile was 22 +/- 2 kg C m(-2) yr(-1). Plot location within the study area did not affect carbon accumulation rates, but estimated basal ages were younger in profiles from plots closer to the bog lagg and farther from the bog outlet. In addition, carbon accumulation varied considerably over time. Early Holocene net carbon accumulation rates were 30 +/- 6 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Around 3300 calendar BP, net carbon accumulation rates dropped to 15 +/- 8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) until the last century when net accumulation rates increased again to 74 +/- 57 g C m(-2) yr(-1). During this period of low accumulation, regional droughts may have lowered the water table, allowing for enhanced aerobic decomposition and making the bog more susceptible to fire. These results suggest that experimental warming treatments, as well as a future warmer climate may reduce net carbon accumulation in peat in this and other southern boreal peatlands. Furthermore, our we caution against historical interpretations extrapolated from one or a few peat cores.

AB 1. Determining the plant traits that best predict carbon (C) storage is increasingly important as global change drivers will affect plant species composition and ecosystem C cycling. Despite the critical role of peatlands in the global C cycle, trait-flux relationships in peatlands are relatively unknown.
   2. We assessed the ability of four non-destructive plant traits to predict carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes over two growing seasons in a temperate peatland in Ontario, Canada. We examined relationships between C-fluxes and leaf area, leaf persistence (deciduous, evergreen), growth form (woody, herbaceous) and aerenchyma tissue. To explore potential inconsistencies between different scales of data aggregation, traits were analysed at the level of plots, species and microsites.
   3. CO2 fluxes showed a positive relationship with leaf area and leaf persistence, and a negative relationship with proportion of woody species. CH4 fluxes showed a positive relationship with aerenchyma and leaf area. The significance of trait-flux relationships differed based on whether data were averaged at the level of plot, species or microsite.
   4. We recommend applying leaf area as a non-destructive trait to other systems where it is not ideal to measure traits destructively. A better understanding of the relationships between above and below-ground traits is likely needed to further explain variation in ecosystem respiration and CH4 fluxes from plant traits.

AB Global change includes land-use change, elevated CO2 concentrations, increased temperature and increased rainfall variability. All four aspects by themselves and in combination will influence the role of roots in linking below- and above-ground ecosystem function via organic and inorganic resource flows. Root-mediated ecosystem functions which may be modified by global change include below-ground resource (water, nutrients) capture, creation and exploitation of spatial heterogeneity, buffering of temporal variations in above-ground factors, supply and storage of C and nutrients to the belowground ecosystem, mobilization of nutrients and C from stored soil reserves, and gas exchange between soil and atmosphere including the emission from soil of greenhouse gases.
   The theory of a functional equilibrium between root and shoot allocation is used to explore predicted responses to elevated CO2 in relation to water or nutrient supply as limiting root function. The theory predicts no change in root:shoot allocation where water uptake is the limiting root function, but substantial shifts where nutrient uptake is (or becomes) the limiting function. Root turnover will not likely be influenced by elevated CO2, but by changes in regularity of water supply. A number of possible mechanisms for root-mediated N mineralization is discussed in the light of climate change factors. Rhizovory (root consumption) may increase under global change as the balance between plant chemical defense and adapted root. consuming organisms may be modified during biome shifts in response to climate change. Root-mediated gas exchange allows oxygen to penetrate into soils and methane (CH4) to escape from wetland soils of tundra ecosystems as well as tropical rice production systems. The effect on net greenhouse gas emissions of biome shifts (fens replacing bogs) as well as of agricultural land management will depend partly on aerenchyma in roots.

AB Anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from rock cores of Valanginian marl from Oberbauenstock (Switzerland) and from samples of sediments of soda lakes in California. Enrichments from the marl were made under fermenting, sulfate-reducing, and methanogenic conditions with concentrations of organic carbon ranging from 8.4 mg/L to 0.84 g/L, 2.1 mg/L to 0.21 g/L, and 2.6 mg/L to 0.26 gn, respectively, at neutral and alkaline pH. Organisms from sediment samples were isolated under the same conditions with carbon contents of 8.4, 2.1, and 2.6 g/L, respectively, at alkaline pH. Growth and activity of the mired cultures obtained were investigated at different values of pH and with limiting carbon source. All cultures obtained were obligate alkaliphilic with an optimum for growth at pH 9.0 for sulfate-reducing and methanogenic cultures, and pH 10.0 for the fermenting culture. Ar these pH values the cultures also grew under carbon-lim)ited conditions (<10 mg carbon/L). Under eutrophic conditions no activity of the fermenting organisms was observed above pH 12, for the sulfate-reducing culture the limiting pH was 11, and for the methanogenic culture about pH 10.5.

AB Drainage, vegetation removal and harvesting, and vegetation restoration have a profound effect on carbon cycling in peatlands. Through laboratory incubations of 114 peat samples collected from the surface layer and just above and just below the water table at 13 sites, we examined the potential for carbon dioxide (CO2) production under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and methane (CH4) production under anaerobic conditions. CO2 production rates ranged from 0.04 to 1.05 mg g(-1) d(-1) under aerobic conditions and 0.01 to 0.29 mg g(-1) d(-1) under anaerobic conditions. Rates of CO2 production were generally smallest in the lower parts of the profiles and at the recently restored sites where deep peat was exposed at the surface; they were largest in the freshly-formed surface peat at the undisturbed bog and older restoration sites where a strong cover of vegetation had developed. The CO2 production potentials were negatively correlated with the Von Post Index of decomposition, and aerobic: anaerobic production ratios averaged 4.3:1. Largest rates of anaerobic CH4 production occurred in samples close to the soil surface with fresh peat accumulation and a high water table, and smallest rates were in samples from the subsurface of sites with a low water table. Anaerobic CH4 production was significantly positively correlated with aerobic and anaerobic CO2 production. These production potentials show that drainage, harvesting, and restoration change the ability of the peat profile to produce and emit CO2 and CH4.

AB Databases of basal radiocarbon (C-14) ages from peatlands have been used extensively at regional and global scales to examine peatland initiation, land-cover change and carbon cycle dynamics. Many dates collected and analyzed before the 1990s are from bulk peat samples of organic-rich sediments, and such basal radiocarbon ages might have been either too young or too old due to inclusion of non-contemporary carbon via translocation from higher horizons. However, there is rarely a systematic assessment of this problem, especially for large datasets. Here we used AMS C-14 dating of both bulk peat and individual macrofossils from the same basal horizon at each of 40 peatland cores across North America and Siberia to evaluate the differences between the two sample types. Our results show that there is no significant or systematic difference between ages derived from bulk material and plant macrofossils. We find that the greatest age overlap of 2 sigma calibrated age distributions occurred between bulk peat and aboveground macrofossils such as moss fragments, seeds, and herbaceous leaves, suggesting that the bulk material is contemporaneous with the aboveground biomass and active carbon uptake. Dates including wood fragments showed wider divergence compared to moss fragments, seeds, and leaves. We find no evidence for statistically significant and consistent bias introduced by C-14 dating of bulk basal peat. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High-latitude wetlands are important for understanding climate change risks because these environments sink carbon dioxide and emit methane. However, fine-scale heterogeneity of wetland landscapes poses a serious challenge when generating regional-scale estimates of greenhouse gas fluxes from point observations. In order to reduce uncertainties at the regional scale, we mapped wetlands and water bodies in the taiga zone of The West Siberia Lowland (WSL) on a scene-by-scene basis using a supervised classification of Landsat imagery. Training data consist of high-resolution images and extensive field data collected at 28 test areas. The classification scheme aims at supporting methane inventory applications and includes seven wetland ecosystem types comprising nine wetland complexes distinguishable at the Landsat resolution. To merge typologies, mean relative areas of wetland ecosystems within each wetland complex type were estimated using high-resolution images. Accuracy assessment based on 1082 validation polygons of 10 x 10 pixel size indicated an overall map accuracy of 79 %. The total area of the WSL wetlands and water bodies was estimated to be 52.4 Mha or 4-12% of the global wetland area. Ridge-hollow complexes prevail in WSL's taiga zone accounting for 33% of the total wetland area, followed by pine bogs or "ryams" (23 %), ridge-hollow-lake complexes (16 %), open fens (8 %), palsa complexes (7 %), open bogs (5 %), patterned fens (4 %), and swamps (4 %). Various oligotrophic environments are dominant among wetland ecosystems, while poor fens cover only 14% of the area. Because of the significant change in the wetland ecosystem coverage in comparison to previous studies, a considerable reevaluation of the total CH4 emissions from the entire region is expected. A new Landsat-based map of WSL's taiga wetlands provides a benchmark for validation of coarse-resolution global land cover products and wetland data sets in high latitudes.

AB Diurnal patterns of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) net fluxes were studied in a permanently submerged, Carex rostrata dominated Swiss alpine fen. Fluxes were measured in August and September using static chambers. Methane was emitted at all six time points analysed during each diurnal cycle with little variation between day, night or twilight (8.3 +/- 0.8 mg m(-2)h(-1) in August). The fen was a nighttime CO2 source (138 +/- 46 mg m(-2)h(-1)) and generally a daytime CO2 sink. Uptake of CO2 varied with light intensity (98 +/- 57 to 391 +/- 43 mg m(-2)h(-1) in August), but light saturation of photosynthesis was apparent at low irradiation levels. Emission or uptake of N2O was not discerned. In September, CH4 and CO2 fluxes were generally lower compared with August, compliant with less green C. rostrata biomass. Diurnal changes in subsurface properties were minor with little influence on the diurnal patterns. Temperature dependency of CH4 and CO2 emissions was apparent under controlled conditions using C. rostrata monoliths. In August, the fen showed highest photosynthetic rates and was a net carbon sink (50 mmol m(-2)day(-1)), but high CH4 emissions resulted in the fen being a net source of 250 mmol CO2 equivalents m(-2)day(-1).

AB This study focuses on the isolation and characterization of bacteria from municipal waste and peat to determine those bacteria with good potential for modification and decomposition of lignocellulosic biomass for industrial application. Twenty cellulase-producing bacteria belonging to four major phyla - Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes - were found when screened on carboxymethyl cellulose-containing agar. Six isolates also exhibited activities towards filter paper as the sole carbon source in salt media, while 12 exhibited activities towards xylan when screened on xylan-containing plates. Moreover, 5 isolates survived in and increased the absorbance of 1% black liquor in salt media by an average of 2.07-fold after 21 days of incubation. Similarly, these 5 isolates increased the absorbance of 0.1% pure lignin at 280 nm in salt media, indicating modification of lignin. Additionally, the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis of 1% barley straw treated for 21 days with these 5 strains showed a preference for consumption of hemicelluloses over lignin; however, a change in lignin was observed. A Bacillus strain (5555) and a Pseudomonas strain (AS1) displayed the greatest potential for lignocellulose decomposition due to a variety of cellulase activities, as well as xylanase activity and modification of lignin. Several of these isolates have good potential for industrial use in the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB The accuracy of the Nitrogen and Carbon cycling in Soil, Water And Plant (NCSWAP) model to simulate (nitrate-nitrogen) NO3-N leaching from orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) pasture was evaluated using data collected from a 3-yr leaching experiment conducted in central Pennsylvania on Hagerstown silt loam soil (fine, mired, mesic, Typic Hapludalf). Nitrate leaching losses below the I-m depth from N-fertilized orchardgrass sod were measured with intact soil core lysimeters (0.6-m diam. by 1-m long), Five N-fertilizer treatments consisted of a control, urine application in the spring, urine application in the summer, urine application in the fall, and feces application in the summer were used to test the model, The model was calibrated using the data from 1993 to 1994 and then was validated using 1994 to 1995 and 1995 to 1996 water flow and NO3-N leaching data. Statistical analysis indicated a good fit between field measured and predicted NO3-N leaching for most treatments in each year. The model simulations of water flow and NO3-N leaching losses below the l-m depth were compared with the mean of measured field data for these 3 yr, The results of this study showed that the NCSWAP model performed well and accurately simulated water flow and total annual NO3-N loss through leaching below the l-m depth under orchardgrass pasture, However, the model failed to produce accurate simulations for the feces treatment in 1994 to 1995. The simulation error in the feces treatment seemed to be related to N mineralization process in the model, Generally, the results of this study suggest that the NCSWAP model can be used for predicting NO3-N leached annually from pastured orchardgrass.

AB Temperate grasslands on organic soils are diverse due to edaphic properties but also to regional management practices and this heterogeneity is reflected in the wide range of greenhouse gas (GHG) flux values reported in the literature. In Ireland, most grasslands on organic soils were drained several decades ago and are managed as extensive pastures with little or no fertilisation. This study describes a 2-year study of the net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) of two such sites. We determined GHG fluxes and waterborne carbon (C) emissions in a nutrient-rich grassland and compared it with values measured from two nutrient-poor organic soils: a deep-drained and a shallow-drained site. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were determined using the chamber technique, and fluvial C fluxes were estimated by combining drainage water concentrations and flows.
   The nutrient-rich site was an annual source of CO2 (233 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), CH4 neutral, and a small source of N2O (0.16 g N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1)). Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) at the shallow-drained nutrient-poor site was -89 and -99 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Years 1 and 2 respectively, and NEE at the deep-drained nutrient-poor site was 85 and -26 g C m(-2) yr(-1) respectively. Low CH4 emissions (1.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) were recorded at the shallow-drained nutrient-poor site. Fluvial exports from the nutrient-rich site totalled 69.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) with 54% as dissolved organic C. Waterborne C losses from the nutrient-poor site reflected differences in annual runoff totalling 44 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Year 1 and 30.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Year 2.
   The NECB of the nutrient-rich grassland was 663 g C m(-2) yr(-1) with biomass exports being the major component accounting for 53 %. The NECB of the nutrient-poor deep-drained site was less than half of the nutrient-rich site (2-year mean 267 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Although NEE at the nutrient-poor shallow-drained site was negative in both years, high biomass export meant it was a net C source (2-year mean NECB 103 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). While the impacts of the nutrient and drainage status on NEE, biomass exports and fluvial C losses were confirmed, inter-regional differences in management practice and climate were also significant factors which impacted on the overall NECB of these ecosystems. Contrary to expectation, the NECB of nutrient-poor drained organic soils under grasslands is not necessarily a large C source and this has implications for Ireland's choice of national GHG inventory reporting methodologies. This study can also aid the development of strategies to deliver reduced emissions tailored to local grassland types.

AB Coastal wetlands are a significant carbon (C) sink since they store carbon in anoxic soils. This ecosystem service is impacted by hydrologic alteration and management of these coastal habitats. Efforts to restore tidal flow to former salt marshes have increased in recent decades and are generally associated with alteration of water inundation levels and salinity. This study examined the effect of water level and salinity changes on soil organic matter decomposition during a 60-day incubation period. Intact soil cores from impounded fresh water marsh and salt marsh were incubated after addition of either sea water or fresh water under flooded and drained water levels. Elevating fresh water marsh salinity to 6 to 9ppt enhanced CO2 emission by 50%-80% and most typically decreased CH4 emissions, whereas, decreasing the salinity from 26ppt to 19ppt in salt marsh soils had no effect on CO2 or CH4 fluxes. The effect from altering water levels was more pronounced with drained soil cores emitting 10-fold more CO2 than the flooded treatment in both marsh sediments. Draining soil cores also increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Stable carbon isotope analysis of CO2 generated during the incubations of fresh water marsh cores in drained soils demonstrates that relict peat OC that accumulated when the marsh was saline was preferentially oxidized when sea water was introduced. This study suggests that restoration of tidal flow that raises the water level from drained conditions would decrease aerobic decomposition and enhance C sequestration. It is also possible that the restoration would increase soil C decomposition of deeper deposits by anaerobic oxidation, however this impact would be minimal compared to lower emissions expected due to the return of flooding conditions.

AB Rivers transport both organic and inorganic carbon from their sources to the sea. Results of similar to 800 organic and inorganic analyses from various British rivers of contrasting size and land use are presented here: (1) the headwater River Tern, a rural river of 852 km(2) catchment; (2) the Ouseburn, a small urban 55 km(2) catchment; (3) the River Tyne, a larger river system of similar to 3000 km(2) catchment; (4) a spatial survey from 205 sample sites on similar to 60 rivers from SW England. We found that, with the exception of peat-rich headwaters, DIC concentration is always greater than DOC. DIC is primarily in the form HCO3-, with DIC concentrations highest in highly urbanised catchments, typically greater than those observed in catchments with carbonate bedrock, demonstrating a significant and previously unrecognised anthropogenic inorganic carbon input to urban rivers.

AB Fens, which extend over vast areas in the Northern hemisphere, are sources of the greenhouse gas CH4. Climate change scenarios predict a lowering water table (WT) in mires. To study the effect of WT drawdown on CH4 dynamics in a fen ecosystem, we took advantage of a WT drawdown gradient near a ground water extraction plant. Methane fluxes and CH4 production and oxidation potentials were related to microbial communities responsible for the processes in four mire locations (wet, semiwet, semidry, and dry). Principal component analyses performed on the vegetation, pH, CH4, and WT results clearly separated the four sampling locations in the gradient. Long-term lowering of WT was associated with decreased coverage of Sphagnum and aerenchymatic plants, decreased CH4 field emissions and CH4 production potential. Based on mcrA terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism the methanogen community structure correlated best with the methane production and coverage of aerenchymatic plants along the gradient. Methanosarcinaceae and Methanocellales were found at the pristine wet end of the gradient, whereas the Fen cluster characterized the dry end. The methane-oxidizing bacterial community consisted exclusively of Methylocystis bacteria, but interestingly of five different alleles (T, S, R, M, and O) of the particulate methane monooxygenase marker gene pmoA. The M allele was dominant in the wet locations, and the occurrence of alleles O, S, and T increased with drainage. The occurrence of the R allele that characterized the upper peat layer correlated with CH4 oxidation potential. These results advance our understanding of mire dynamics after long-term WT drawdown and of the microbiological bases of methane emissions from mires.

AB Calcareous tufas are great archives of geochemical information for the reconstruction of past climate. Their importance increases in the regions where other proxies are rare, such as Western Carpathians. Here, we present the first whole-Holocene palaeoclimatic reconstruction for this region based on geochemical proxies. We analysed O-18, C-13 and Mg/Ca ratio on tufa calcite of the Mituchovci site (White Carpathian Mountains, W Slovakia) and compared these with pollen, plant macrofossil and mollusc data. According to O-18, two distinct thermal maxima occurred in the region, around 11.4 ka and between 7.3 and 6.9 ka BP. According to C-13 and Mg/Ca ratio, a steep increase in moisture and rainfall took place around 8.5 ka cal. BP, preceded by a cold and dry event. These events are well reflected in the biotic proxies and are suggested also by other palaeoenvironmental studies from the Carpathians. We found some later fluctuations, with dry and warm Bronze Age (ca. 3.6 ka cal. BP), cold and wet Urnfield period (ca. 2.8 ka cal. BP), warm Roman period (ca. 2 ka cal. BP) and cold but humid Migration period (ca. 1.5 ka cal. BP). We observed extreme abruptness and amplitude of the variation in all geochemical proxies in the last 500 years, when biotic proxies imply a very intense human deforestation. Land-use changes may have altered both the temperature regime in the studied fen and the carbon cycle in the recharge area.

AB An improved regional assessment of the productivity of grasslands depends on comprehensive knowledge of the interactions between climatic drivers, vegetation properties and human activity. Managed grasslands in Europe display highly dynamic responses, which contribute to the challenge in making representative model simulations. Therefore, we investigated the relationships between vegetation state changes and productivity of meadow grasslands by comparing three study sites in Southern Germany (DE-Fen, DE-RbW, DE-Gwg), which are characterised by different management intensities and elevations. Weekly observations of vegetation height, leaf area, above-ground biomass and plant functional types were compared to estimates of the gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) determined from atmospheric surface exchange of carbon dioxide. We found that the cumulative GEP of these grasslands correlated positively with management intensity and negatively with elevation at the seasonal scale. The differences in above-ground vegetation properties among the three sites were most pronounced during spring and contributed to significant differences in annual carbon (200%) and nitrogen (4%) biomass yields. Nevertheless, when periods between harvests were considered individually, the relationship between GEP and above-ground biomass, leaf area and vegetation height appeared to follow unified patterns for all sites. In addition, our study highlights a substantial potential for systematic error based on the techniques used to quantify vegetation properties and a mitigating approach was evaluated that includes continuous automated observations of vegetation height. These outcomes can serve as a reference for modelling studies on the seasonal allocation of carbon and vegetation properties in managed humid temperate grassland systems.

AB We studied the potential effects of management and harvesting intensity on the timber supply from Finnish forests in a changing climate and, consequently, the possibilities of meeting the increasing wood demand of the growing forest-based bioeconomy. The study employed data from the 11th National Forest Inventory of Finland. Plots located on forest land assigned to timber production were used to develop two even-flow harvesting scenarios with annual timber harvesting targets of 60 and 80 million m(3). Calculations were done for a 90-year simulation period under the current and changing climates using recent-generation (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) global climate model projections under three representative concentration pathways forcing scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5). Intensified management used improved seed and seedling stock in artificial regeneration. It also used fertilization on subxeric pine-dominated and mesic spruce-dominated stands and ditch maintenance on 40% of drained peatlands, when the growing stock characteristics fulfilled a set of predetermined criteria. Our results showed that, with intensified management, it is possible to harvest 80 million m(3).year(-1) of timber under mild (RCP2.6) and moderate (RCP4.5) climate change without decreasing the growing stock volume at the country level during the 90-year simulation period. This is not possible under severe climate change (RCP8.5) due to the rapid decline in forest growth, particularly in the south after about 30 years.

AB Global change models normally do not include interaction effects between different pools of recalcitrant humic organic carbon which can alter carbon cycling via their influence on biological activities. This issue is especially important in northern regions where lakes receive high inputs of allochthonous dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the extensive surrounding peatlands. We investigated the threshold of added labile DOC necessary to promote a priming effect (PE); i.e. stimulation of bacterial metabolism with a subsequent increase in the mineralization of recalcitrant DOC and the accompanying changes in microbial community structure and function. Our study was carried out in a small highly humic lake (Mekkojarvi, southern Finland), physically divided by a plastic curtain into two experimental basins, one where fish were present (+FISH) and one that was fishless (-FISH). In each basin, we performed a factorial mesocosm experiment in which different amounts of labile DOC were supplied as cane sugar (control +6, +9, +12 mg C L-1). Our results showed no priming effect in any carbon treatment, either in +FISH or in -FISH basins, despite a decreasing trend in total DOC concentration. Bacterial abundance and production did not increase as a response to carbon additions, while mixotrophic algae increased their abundance over time. In our experiments, the organisms that benefitted most after addition of labile DOC were mixotrophic algae, which can transform carbon into biomass by obtaining inorganic nutrients through phagotrophy. This appears most likely due to strong bacterial N limitation and dependence on resource availability and stoichiometry.

AB Boreal forests exchange large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) with the atmosphere. A managed boreal landscape usually comprises various potential CO2 sinks and sources across forest stands of varying age classes, clear-cut areas, mires, and lakes. Due to this heterogeneity and complexity, large uncertainties exist regarding the net CO2 balance at the landscape scale. In this study, we present the first estimate of the net CO2 exchange over a managed boreal landscape (similar to 68 km(2)) in northern Sweden, based on tall tower eddy covariance measurements. Our results suggest that from March 1, 2016 to February 28, 2018, the heterogeneous landscape was a net CO2 sink with a 2-year mean uptake of -87 +/- 6g C m(-2) yr(-1). Due to an earlier and warmer spring and sunnier autumn, the landscape was a stronger CO2 sink during the first year (-122 +/- 8g C m(-2)) compared to the second year (-52 +/- 9g C m(-2)). Footprint analysis shows that 87% of the CO2 flux measurements originated from forests, whereas mires, clear-cuts, lakes, and grassland contributed 11%, 1%, 0.7%, and 0.2%, respectively. Altogether, the CO2 sink strength of the heterogeneous landscape was up to 38% lower compared to the sink strength of a mature stand surrounding the tower. Overall, this study suggests that the managed boreal landscape acted as a CO2 sink and advocates tall tower eddy covariance measurements to improve regional carbon budget estimates.

AB Drainage and rewetting of peatlands changes their carbon (C) dynamics. We measured C stocks in the soil and biomass of drained and rewetted peatland forests in the region of the National Park Hunsruck-Hochwald, Germany. A detailed soil map was produced, showing the important soil properties for soil C stocks. Based on the horizon-substrate combination as well as LiDAR data, the spatial distribution of soil and forest C stocks was analysed. Our results show that our peatland sites have shallow soils with a heterogeneous spatial distribution. Mean (+/- SE) soil C stocks in the monitoring sites are 121(+/- 8) t ha(-1) whereas the forest stores on average 71(+/- 0.2) t ha(-1) of C in the biomass. Tree removal in the drained peatlands reduced the total C stocks by 4,430 t. The quality and longevity of the wood products that arise from tree removal will determine whether or not the harvested portion of the C captured by the trees is sequestered over long timescales. Additionally, the success of rewetting activities and the potential soil carbon sequestration or (non-) soil carbon loss will determine whether these ecosystems are carbon sinks or sources. An extrapolation of our data resulted in estimated C stocks of 171,530 t and 544,282 t for peatland soils and for the spruce forest, respectively, for the whole area of the National Park (about 10,000 ha).

AB Wetland soils are an important component of the Global Carbon Cycle because they store about 20-25% of the terrestrial soil organic carbon (SOC). Wetlands occupy about 6% of the global land surface and any change in their use or management has potentially dramatic consequences on greenhouse gases emissions. However, the capacity of wetland soils to store carbon (C) differs from place to place due to reasons still not well understood. The objective of this review was to evaluate the global variations in wetlands SOC content (SOCc) and to relate it to key soil and environmental factors such as soil texture, intensity of soil hydromorphy, metallic element content and climate. A comprehensive data analysis was performed using 122 soil profiles from 29 studies performed under temperate, humid, sub-humid, tropical and sub-arctic conditions. The results point to average SOCc of 53.5 +/- 15.8 g C kg(-1) with a maximum of 540 g C kg(-1). SOCc increased with increase in intensity of soil hydromorphy (r = - 0.52), Al (r = 0.19) and Fe content (r = 0.21), and decreased with soil pH (r = - 0.24). There was also a surprising tendency for intensity of soil hydromorphy, and thus SOCc, to decrease with increasing mean annual precipitation and soil clay content. These results contribute to a better understanding of the impact of soil hydromorphy in wetlands on organic C stabilization in the soils. However, further studies with additional information on soil bulk density to assess carbon C stocks, still need to be performed.

AB Small acidophilic archaea belonging to Micrarchaeota and Parvarchaeota phyla are known to physically interact with some Thermoplasmatales members in nature. However, due to a lack of cultivation and limited genomes on hand, their biodiversity, metabolisms, and physiologies remain largely unresolved. Here, we obtained 39 genomes from acid mine drainage (AMD) and hot spring environments around the world. 16S rRNA gene based analyses revealed that Parvarchaeota were only detected in AMD and hot spring habitats, while Micrarchaeota were also detected in others including soil, peat, hypersaline mat, and freshwater, suggesting a considerable higher diversity and broader than expected habitat distribution for this phylum. Despite their small genomes (0.64-1.08 Mb), these archaea may contribute to carbon and nitrogen cycling by degrading multiple saccharides and proteins, and produce ATP via aerobic respiration and fermentation. Additionally, we identified several syntenic genes with homology to those involved in iron oxidation in six Parvarchaeota genomes, suggesting their potential role in iron cycling. However, both phyla lack biosynthetic pathways for amino acids and nucleotides, suggesting that they likely scavenge these biomolecules from the environment and/or other community members. Moreover, low-oxygen enrichments in laboratory confirmed our speculation that both phyla are microaerobic/anaerobic, based on several specific genes identified in them. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses provide insights into the close evolutionary history of energy related functionalities between both phyla with Thermoplasmatales. These results expand our understanding of these elusive archaea by revealing their involvement in carbon, nitrogen, and iron cycling, and suggest their potential interactions with Thermoplasmatales on genomic scale.

AB The particulate methane monooxygenase gene pmoA, encoding the 27 kDa polypeptide of the membrane-bound particulate methane monooxygenase, was amplified by PCR from DNA isolated from a blanket peat bog and from enrichment cultures established, from the same environment, using methane as sole carbon and energy source. The resulting 525 bp PCR products were cloned and a representative number of clones were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the derived amino acid sequences of the pmoA clones retrieved directly from environmental DNA samples revealed that they form a distinct cluster within representative PmoA sequences from type II methanotrophs and may originate from a novel group of acidophilic methanotrophs. The study also demonstrated the utility of the pmoA gene as a phylogenetic marker for identifying methanotroph-specific DNA sequences in the environment.

AB Anaerobic decomposition in wetland soils is carried out by several interacting microbial processes that influence carbon storage and greenhouse gas emissions. To understand the role of wetlands in the global carbon cycle, it is critical to understand how differences in both electron donor (i.e., organic carbon) and terminal electron acceptor (TEA) availability influence anaerobic mineralization of soil organic matter. In this study we manipulated electron donors and acceptors to examine how these factors influence total rates of carbon mineralization and the pathways of microbial respiration (e.g., sulfate reduction versus methanogenesis). Using a field-based reciprocal transplant of soils from brackish and freshwater tidal marshes, in conjunction with laboratory amendments of TEAs, we examined how rates of organic carbon mineralization changed when soils with different carbon contents were exposed to different TEAs. Total mineralization (the sum of CO2 + CH4 produced) on a per gram soil basis was greater in the brackish marsh soils, which had higher soil organic matter content: however, on a per gram carbon basis, mineralization was greater in the freshwater soils, suggesting that the quality of carbon inputs from the freshwater plants was higher. Overall anaerobic metabolism was higher for both soil types incubated at the brackish site where SO42- was the dominant TEA. When soils were amended with TEAs in the laboratory, more thermodynamically favorable respiration pathways typically resulted in greater organic matter mineralization (Fe(III) respiration > SO42- reduction > methanogenesis). These results suggest that both electron donors and acceptors play important roles in regulating anaerobic microbial mineralization of soil organic matter. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This presents the longest, consistent records of dissolved organic carbon in rivers ever published. This study presents long-term records of organic matter as indicated by water colour that were constructed for three catchments in Northern England for as far back as 1962. Observations show that there have been large increases in DOC concentrations over the period of study with in one case a doubling of the concentration over a period of 29 years. However, in one of the catchments no significant change was observed over a 31-year period. All catchments show common inter-annual control on carbon release in response to droughts, but no step increases in DOC concentrations were observed in response to such perturbations with pre-drought levels being restored within a period 3-4 years. Observed increasing trends do not correlate with changes in river discharge, pH, alkalinity or rainfall, but do coincide with increasing average summer temperatures in the region. The times series of DOC concentration over the period of the record appears stationary, but the distribution of daily values suggests a change in sources of colour over the increasing trend. The evidence supports a view that increases in carbon release are in equilibrium with temperature increases accentuated by land-use factors.

AB Carbon isotope analyses of terrigenous organic matter are often used to reconstruct changes in the isotopic composition of upper ocean and atmospheric carbon reservoirs. Carbon isotope values from tree-rings, fossil wood, and coal matrices have been related to climatic change (e.g. temperature, humidity) via water-use efficiency of land plants. In this study, we report on carbon isotope analyses on low-rank coal deposits of the Alpine Realm and Middle German Lignite District covering the Early Eocene to Pliocene time interval. Fossil wood and extracted wood cellulose from gymnosperms and angiosperms, respectively, are used for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. The trend in delta C-13 is parallel to the carbon isotope record obtained from benthic foraminifera, because both data sets sample a common reservoir in the atmosphere. The evaluation of the magnitudes of delta C-13 variations of coal caused by environmental change, requires the correction of the delta C-13 data due to the effects of different contents of lipids in the organic matter, differences in biogeochemical carbon cycling, varying contributions of gymnosperms versus angiosperms to peat formation, and differences in delta C-13 of atmospheric CO2. The resulting carbon isotope record of coal generally co-vaFies with the estimated variability in mean annual temperatures during the Tertiary, based on paleobotanical data. Changes in humidity and pCO(2) may be responsible for deviations between the isotopic trend and the paleotemperature curve during the Miocene. The obtained temperature coefficient for delta C-13 of C3 plants of about 0.3%./degrees C is in agreement with the results of previous studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The dissolved CO2 concentration of stream waters is an important component of the terrestrial carbon cycle. This study reconstructs long-term records of dissolved CO2 concentration for the outlets of two large catchments (818 and 586 km(2)) in northern England. The study shows that:
   1. The flux of dissolved CO2 from the catchments (as carbon per catchment area), when adjusted for that which would be carried by the river water at equilibrium with the atmosphere, is between 0 and 0.39 t km (-2) year(-1) for the River Tees and between 0 and 0.65 t km(-2) year(-1) for the River Coquet.
   2. The flux of dissolved CO2 is closely correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export and is unrelated to dissolved CO2 export from the headwaters of the study catchments.
   3. The evasion rate Of CO2 from the rivers (as carbon per stream area) is between 0.0 and 1.49 kg m(-2) year(-1), and calculated in-stream productions Of CO2 are estimated as between 0.5 and 2.5% of the stream evasion rate.
   4. By mass balance, it is estimated that 8% of the annual flux of DOC is lost within the streams of the catchment.
   The study shows that the loss Of CO2 from the streams of the Tees catchment is between 3.1 and 7.5 kt year(-1) (as carbon) for the River Tees, which is the same order as annual CH4 flux from peats within the catchment and approximately 50% of the net CO2 exchange to the peats of the catchment.

AB Wildfire represents the single largest disturbance to the ecohydrological function of northern peatlands. Alterations to peatland thermal behavior as a result of wildfire will modify the carbon balance of these important long-term global carbon stores and regulate post-fire ecosystem recovery. We simulate the 3-D thermal behavior of a peatland that has been disturbed by wildfire to identify how changes in peat temperatures emerge from changes to the surface energy balance and peat thermal properties. Peat temperatures are simulated within two adjacent peatlands, one area having burned 4 years previously, the second which has been wildfire-free for 75 years. We demonstrate that there is only a small alteration to the thermal response in Sphagnum fuscum hummocks that are not severely burnt within the wildfire. In contrast, wildfire produces important changes to the energy balance of Sphagnum hollows. A large reduction in the latent heat flux post-fire increases surface temperatures by up to 30 degrees C during daytime summer conditions. However, temperatures through the peat profile are insensitive to these increases in surface temperature. The low surface moisture content of near-surface peat insulates the profile from these higher temperatures and, at depths below 0.015 m, only small differences are identifiable between burned and unburned hollow temperatures. Nevertheless, we argue that these alterations to near-surface temperatures and evaporation rates likely substantially influence the thermal and hydrological conditions post-wildfire, impacting the peatland recovery.

AB Peatlands form a large carbon (C) pool but their C sink is labile and susceptible to changes in climate and land-use. Some pristine peatlands are forested, and others have the potential: the amount of arboreal vegetation is likely to increase if soil water levels are lowered as a consequence of climate change. On those sites tree litter dynamics may be crucial for the C balance. We studied the decomposition of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needle and root litter in boreal peatland sites representing gradients in drainage succession (succession following water level drawdown caused by forest drainage) and soil nutrient level during several years of varying weather conditions. Neither gradient had an unambiguous effect on litter mass loss. Mass loss over 2 years was faster in undrained versus drained sites for both needle litter, incubated in the moss layer, and fine root litter, incubated in 0-10 cm peat layer, suggesting moisture stress in the surface layers of the drained sites limited decomposition. Differences among the drained sites were not consistent. Among years, mass loss correlated positively with precipitation variables, and mostly negatively or not at all with temperature sum. We concluded that a long-term water level drawdown in peatlands does not necessarily enhance decay of fresh organic matter. Instead, the drained site may turn into a 'large hummock-system' where several factors, including litter quality, relative moisture deficiency, higher acidity, lower substrate temperature, and in deeper layers also oxygen deficiency, may interact to constrain organic matter decomposition. Further, the decomposition rates may not vary systematically among sites of different soil nutrient levels following water level drawdown. Our results emphasize the importance of annual weather variations on decomposition rates, and demonstrate that single-period incubation studies incorporate an indeterminable amount of temporal variation.

TI Temperature-Induced Increase in Methane Release from Peat Bogs: A
   Mesocosm Experiment
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CARBON; PEATLANDS; CH4
AB Peat bogs are primarily situated at mid to high latitudes and future climatic change projections indicate that these areas may become increasingly wetter and warmer. Methane emissions from peat bogs are reduced by symbiotic methane oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs). Higher temperatures and increasing water levels will enhance methane production, but also methane oxidation. To unravel the temperature effect on methane and carbon cycling, a set of mesocosm experiments were executed, where intact peat cores containing actively growing Sphagnum were incubated at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 degrees C. After two months of incubation, methane flux measurements indicated that, at increasing temperatures, methanotrophs are not able to fully compensate for the increasing methane production by methanogens. Net methane fluxes showed a strong temperature-dependence, with higher methane fluxes at higher temperatures. After removal of Sphagnum, methane fluxes were higher, increasing with increasing temperature. This indicates that the methanotrophs associated with Sphagnum plants play an important role in limiting the net methane flux from peat. Methanotrophs appear to consume almost all methane transported through diffusion between 5 and 15 degrees C. Still, even though methane consumption increased with increasing temperature, the higher fluxes from the methane producing microbes could not be balanced by methanotrophic activity. The efficiency of the Sphagnum-methanotroph consortium as a filter for methane escape thus decreases with increasing temperature. Whereas 98% of the produced methane is retained at 5 degrees C, this drops to approximately 50% at 25 degrees C. This implies that warming at the mid to high latitudes may be enhanced through increased methane release from peat bogs.

AB Vegetation, wildfire and atmospheric oxygen on Earth have changed throughout geological times, and are dependent on each other, determining the evolution of ecosystems, the carbon cycle, and the climate, as found in the fossil record. Previous work in the literature has only studied flaming wildfires, but smouldering is the most persistent type of fire phenomena, consuming large amounts of biomass. In this study, the dependence of smouldering fires in peatlands, the largest wildfires on Earth, with atmospheric oxygen is investigated. A physics-based computational model of reactive porous media for peat fires, which has been previously validated against experiments, is used. Simulations are conducted for wide ranges of atmospheric oxygen concentrations and fuel moisture contents to find thresholds for ignition and extinction. Results show that the predicted rate of spread increases in oxygen-rich atmospheres, while it decreases over wetter fuels. A novel nonlinear relationship between critical oxygen and critical moisture is found. More importantly, we show that compared to previous work on flaming fires, smouldering fires can be ignited and sustained at substantially higher moisture contents (up to 100% MC vs. 40% for 21% oxygen level), and lower oxygen concentrations (down to 13% vs. 16%). This defines a new atmospheric oxygen threshold for wildfires (13%), even lower than previously thought in Earth Sciences (16%). This finding should lead to reinterpretation of how the char remains observed in the fossil record constrain the lower concentration of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere in geological timescale.

AB This study compares seasonal and spatial variations in methane fluxes as sources of uncertainty in regional CH4 flux upscaling from the wetlands of West Siberia. The study examined variability in summertime CH4 emissions from boreal peatlands, with a focus on two subtaiga fen sites in the southern part of West Siberia (Novosibirskaya oblast). We measured CH4 flux, water table depth, air and peat temperature, pH and electric conductivity of peat water during three field campaigns in summer 2011 (9-12 July, 26-28 July and 20-21 August). Fluxes were measured with static chambers at sites chosen to represent two of the most widespread types of wetlands for this climatic zone: soligenous poor fens and topogenous fens. In both sites the water table level acts as the primary control on fluxes. For the poor fen site with good drainage, water table controls CH4 fluxes on the seasonal scale but not on a local spatial scale; for the fen site with weak drainage and microtopographic relief, the water table controls fluxes on the local spatial scale, but does not drive seasonal variations in the flux magnitude. This difference in hydrology shows the necessity of including detailed wetland type classification schemes into large-scale modeling efforts. From these three measurement periods, we estimated the relative seasonal variation in CH4 emissions as 8% for the fen site and 26% for the poor fen site. These results were compared to estimates of other sources of uncertainty (such as interannual variation and spatial heterogeneity) to show that quantifying seasonal variability is less critical than these other variations for an improved estimate of regional CH4 fluxes. This research demonstrates and ranks the challenges in upscaling measured wetland CH4 fluxes across West Siberia and can guide future field campaigns.

AB Aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) are an environmentally significant group of microorganisms due to their role in the global carbon cycle. Research conducted over the past few decades has increased the interest in discovering novel genera of methane-degrading bacteria, which efficiently utilize methane and decrease the global warming effect. Moreover, methanotrophs have more promising applications in environmental bioengineering, biotechnology, and pharmacy. The investigations were undertaken to recognize the variety of endophytic methanotrophic bacteria associated with Carex nigra, Vaccinium oxycoccus, and Eriophorum vaginatum originating from Moszne peatland (East Poland). Methanotrophic bacteria were isolated from plants by adding sterile fragments of different parts of plants (roots and stems) to agar mineral medium (nitrate mineral salts (NMS)) and incubated at different methane values (1-20% CH4). Single colonies were streaked on new NMS agar media and, after incubation, transferred to liquid NMS medium. Bacterial growth dynamics in the culture solution was studied by optical density-OD600 and methane consumption. Changes in the methane concentration during incubation were controlled by the gas chromatography technique. Characterization of methanotrophs was made by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with Mg705 and Mg84 for type I methanotrophs and Ma450 for type II methanotrophs. Identification of endophytes was performed after 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and mmoX gene amplification. Our study confirmed the presence of both types of methanotrophic bacteria (types I and II) with the predominance of type I methanotrophs. Among cultivable methanotrophs, there were different strains of the genus Methylomonas and Methylosinus. Furthermore, we determined the potential of the examined bacteria for methane oxidation, which ranged from 0.463 +/- 0.067 to 5.928 +/- 0.169 mu mol/L CH4/mL/day.

AB Wetlands play a disproportionately large role in global terrestrial carbon stocks, and from 1 year to the next individual wetlands can fluctuate between carbon sinks and sources depending on factors such as hydrology, temperature, and land use. Although much research has been done on short-term seasonal to annual wetland biogeochemical cycles, there is a lack of experimental evidence concerning how the reversibility of wetland hydrological changes will influence these cycles over longer time periods. Five years of drought-induced declining water table at Lost Creek, a shrub fen wetland in northern Wisconsin, coincided with increased ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross primary production (GPP) as derived from long-term eddy covariance observations. Since then, however, the average water table level at this site has increased, providing a unique opportunity to explore how wetland carbon fluxes are affected by interannual air temperature differences as well as changing water table levels. Water table level, as measured by water discharge, was correlated with R-eco and GPP at interannual time scales. However, air temperature had a strong correlation with R-eco, GPP, and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) at monthly time scales and correlated with NEP at inter-annual time scales. Methane flux was strongly temperature-controlled at seasonal time scales, increasing an order of magnitude from April to July. Annual methane emissions were 51 g C m(-2). Our results demonstrate that over multi-year timescales, water table fluctuations can have limited effects on wetland net carbon fluxes and instead at Lost Creek annual temperature is the best predictor of interannual variation.

AB Forested peatlands are widespread in boreal regions of Canada, and these ecosystems, which are major terrestrial carbon sinks, are undergoing significant transformations linked to climate change, fires and human activities. This study targets millennial-scale vegetation dynamics and related hydrological variability in forested peatlands of the Clay Belt south of James Bay, eastern Canada, using palaeoecological data. Changes in peatland vegetation communities were reconstructed using plant macrofossil analyses, and variations in water-table depths were inferred using testate amoeba analyses. High-resolution analyses of macroscopic charcoal >0.5 mm were used to reconstruct local fire history. Our data showed two successional pathways towards the development of present-day forested peatlands influenced by autogenic processes such as vertical peat growth and related drying, and allogenic factors such as the occurrence of local fires. The oldest documented peatland initiated in a wet rich fen around 8000 cal. a BP shortly after land emergence and transformed into a drier forested bog rapidly after peat inception that persisted over millennia. In the second site, peat started to accumulate from similar to 5200 cal. a BP over a mesic coniferous forest that shifted into a wet forested peatland following a fire that partially consumed the organic layer similar to 4600 cal. a BP. The charcoal records show that fires rarely occurred in these peatlands, but they have favoured the process of forest paludification and influenced successional trajectories over millennia. The macrofossil data suggest that Picea mariana (black spruce) persisted on the peatlands throughout their development, although there were periods of more open canopy due to local fires in some cases. This study brings new understanding on the natural variability of boreal forested peatlands which may help predict their response to future changes in climate, fire regimes and anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Standard sediments are required for prospective risk assessments so that comparable fate and effects data can be generated within and between laboratories. One approach is to use artificial media that can be easily reproduced and characterized. However, a concern is that these media may not simulate natural sediments in terms of binding and toxicological properties, In this study, the acute and chronic effects of permethrin were compared in two artificial and one natural sediment using larvae of the midge Chironomus riparius. The influence of clay and carbon content and organic matter type on permethrin toxicity was also investigated. The toxic response measured in natural sediment was lower than that in the two artificial sediments, one of which contained peat and the other which contained alpha-cellulose as the organic carbon source. Of the two, the peat-based medium gave a more comparable response to the natural sediment. Acute and chronic permethrin toxicity was influenced by all sediment factors investigated with a consistently lower toxicity measured in the peat-based sediment compared with the a-cellulose sediment. A decrease in toxicity. coupled with an increase in bulk sediment permethrin concentration, was seen as both clay and organic carbon contents increased. Consideration should be given to improving the environmental realism of simple artificial formulations if the intention is to represent effects measured in natural sediments.

AB Peatlands cover 3% of the earth's land surface but contain 30% of the world's soil carbon pool. Microbial communities constitute a crucial detrital food web for nutrient and carbon cycling in peatlands. Heterotrophic protozoans are considered top predators in the microbial food web; however, they are not yet well understood. In this study, we investigated seasonal dynamics in the community and the trophic structure of testate amoebae in four peatlands. Testate amoebae density and biomass in August were significantly higher than those in May and October. The highest density, 6.7 x 10(4) individual g(-1) dry moss, was recorded in August 2014. The highest biomass, 7.7 x 10(2) mu g Cg(-1) dry moss, was recorded in August 2013. Redundancy analyses showed that water-table depth was the most important factor, explaining over one third of the variance in fauna communities in all sampled seasons. High trophic position taxa dominated testate amoebae communities. The Shannon diversity index and community size structure index declined from August to October in 2013 and from May to October in 2014. These seasonal patterns of testate amoebae indicated the seasonal variations of the peatlands' microbial food web and are possibly related to the seasonal carbon dynamics in Northeast Chinese peatlands.

AB With respect to their role in the global carbon cycle, natural peatlands are characterized by their ability to sequester atmospheric carbon. This trait is strongly connected to the water regime of these ecosystems. Large parts of the soil profile in natural peatlands are water saturated, leading to anoxic conditions and to a diminished decomposition of plant litter. In functioning peatlands, the rate of carbon fixation by plant photosynthesis is larger than the decomposition rate of dead organic material. Over time, the amount of carbon that remains in the soil and is not converted back to carbon dioxide grows. Land use of peatlands often goes along with water level manipulations and thereby with alterations of carbon flux dynamics. In this study, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) flux measurements from a bog site in northwestern Germany that has been heavily degraded by peat mining are presented. Two contrasting types of management have been implemented at the site: (1) drainage during ongoing peat harvesting on one half of the central bog area and (2) rewetting on the other half that had been taken out of use shortly before measurements commenced. The presented 2-year data set was collected with an eddy covariance (EC) system set up on a central railroad dam that divides the two halves of the (former) peat harvesting area. We used footprint analysis to split the obtained CO2 and CH4 flux time series into data characterizing the gas exchange dynamics of both contrasting land use types individually. The time series gaps resulting from data division were filled using the response of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to environmental variables, footprint variability, and fuzzy transformations of seasonal and diurnal cyclicity. We used the gap-filled gas flux time series from 2 consecutive years to evaluate the impact of rewetting on the annual vertical carbon balances of the cutover bog. Rewetting had a considerable effect on the annual carbon fluxes and led to increased CH4 and decreased CO2 release.
   The larger relative difference between cumulative CO2 fluxes from the rewetted (13 +/- 6 mol m(-2) a(-1)) and drained (22 +/- 7 mol m(-2) a(-1)) section occurred in the second observed year when rewetting apparently reduced CO2 emissions by 40 %. The absolute difference in annual CH4 flux sums was more similar between both years, while the relative difference of CH4 release between the rewetted (0.83 +/- 0.15 mol m(-2) a(-1)) and drained (0.45 +/- 0.11 mol m(-2) a(-1)) section was larger in the first observed year, indicating a maximum increase in annual CH4 release of 84% caused by rewetting at this particular site during the study period.

AB Assessing moisture contents of lichens and mosses using ground-based high spectral resolution spectrometers (400-2500 nm) offers immense opportunities for a comprehensive monitoring of peatland moisture status by satellite/airborne imagery. This information may be valuable for present and future carbon balance modeling. Previous studies are based upon point measurements of vegetation moisture content and water table position, and therefore a detailed moisture status of entire northern peatlands is not available. Consequently, upscaling ground and remotely sensed data to the desired spatial resolutions is inevitable. This study continues our previous investigation of the impact of various moisture conditions of common sub-Arctic lichen and moss species (i.e., Cladina stellaris, Cladina rangiferina, Dicranum elongatum, and Tomenthypnum nitens) upon the spectral signatures obtained in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada. Upscaling reflectance measurements of the above species were conducted in the field, and reflectance analysis using a singularity index was made, since this study serves as a basis for future aircraft/satellite research. An attempt to upscale current and new spectral reflectance indices developed in our previous studies was made as well. Our findings indicate that the spectral index C. rangiferina is to a lesser amount influenced by scale since it has a small R-2 values between the log of the index and the log of the resolution, reduced slopes between the log of the index and the log of the resolution, and similar slopes between log reflectance and log resolution (alpha) of two wavelengths employed by the index. Future study should focus on concurrent monitoring of moisture variations in lichens and mosses both in situ and from satellite and airborne images, as well as analysis of fractal models in relations to the upscaling experiments.

AB Peatlands, hydromorphous soils with high organic matter content, display, as a result of anaerobic conditions, a delayed litter decomposition and therefore constitute important terrestric sinks for carbon and nitrogen compounds. In spite of their relatively small area proportion of approx. 3% (3.88-4.38 x 10(6) km(2)), peatlands contain approx. 30% of the world's soil carbon and nitrogen reserves. Several signs indicate that substantial drainage and increasing temperatures due to the increasing cultivation of peatlands and the global climate change could result in a large-scale conversion of peatlands from C/N sinks to C/N sources. Irrespective of many uncertain details and complex interactions with other factors, the lowering of the groundwater table of peatlands actually seems to strongly enhance the net release of the radiatively active trace gases carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, reducing at the same time the high emissions of methane that occur in natural peatlands. The antizipated climate change will probably induce large-scale shifts in the distribution of the different peatland ecosystems along with considerable changes of the trace gas emissions. In view of this development, a net loss of global peatland area along with an increase in their contribution to the greenhouse effect must be expected.

   TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; CONSUMPTION; PHRAGMITES; OXIDATION
AB Drainage of peatlands for agriculture causes an increase of CO2 flux from peat decomposition, contributing to national CO2 emission. The reverse process, i.e. for re-creation of wetlands, reduces the CO2 flux, but increases the CH4 flux. We developed a process model (PEATLAND) to simulate these fluxes from peat soils subject to different water-table management scenarios. The model combines primary production, aerobic decomposition of soil organic matter (including the soil-parent material, peat), CH4 formation, oxidation, and transport. Model input requires specification of water table and air temperature data sets, vegetation parameters such as primary production and parameters related to gas transport, and basic soil physical data. Validation using closed flux-chamber measurements Of CO2 and CH4 from five different sites in the western Netherlands shows that seasonal changes in fluxes Of CO2 and CH4 are correctly modelled. However, the CO2 submodel underestimates peat decomposition when peat decomposition rates obtained from laboratory incubation experiments are used as input. Field decomposition rates are considerably higher. This is attributed to enhancement of decomposition by the addition of easily decomposable material from root exudation ('priming effect'). Model experiments indicate that 1) drainage increases the CO2 production from peat decomposition strongly; 2) restoring a high water table may decrease the total greenhouse gas flux by a small amount although the CH4 flux increases strongly; 3) a warmer climate may cause higher greenhouse gas fluxes from peat soils resulting in a positive feedback to climate warming, and 4) high vegetation productivity in fen meadows may stimulate peat decomposition by the priming effect.

AB Mosses and lichens are important components of boreal landscapes [Vitt et al., 1994; Bubier et al., 1997]. They affect plant productivity and belowground carbon sequestration and alter the surface runoff and energy balance. We report the use of multiresolution satellite data to map moss and lichens over the BOREAS region at a 10 in, 30 in, and I km scales. Our moss and lichen classification at the 10 in scale is based on ground observations of associations among soil drainage classes, overstory composition, and cover type among four broad classes of ground cover (feather, sphagnum, and brown mosses and lichens). For our 30 in map, we used field observations of ground cover-overstory associations to map mosses and lichens in the BOREAS southern study area (SSA). To scale up to a I km (AVHRR) moss map of the BOREAS region, we used the TM SSA mosaics plus regional field data to identify AVHRR overstory-ground cover associations. We found that: 1) ground cover, overstory composition and density are highly correlated, permitting inference of moss and lichen cover from satellite-based land cover classifications; 2) our I m moss map reveals that mosses dominate the boreal landscape of central Canada, thereby a significant factor for water, energy, and carbon modeling; 3) TM and AVHRR moss cover maps are comparable; 4) satellite data resolution is important, particularly in detecting the smaller wetland features, lakes, and upland jack pine sites; and 5) distinct regional patterns of moss and lichen cover correspond to latitudinal and elevational gradients.

TI Recent acceleration of biomass burning and carbon losses in Alaskan
   forests and peatlands
SO NATURE GEOSCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID FIRE; CLIMATE; PERMAFROST; EMISSIONS
AB Climate change has increased the area affected by forest fires each year in boreal North America(1,2). Increases in burned area and fire frequency are expected to stimulate boreal carbon losses(3-5). However, the impact of wildfires on carbon emissions is also affected by the severity of burning. How climate change influences the severity of biomass burning has proved difficult to assess. Here, we examined the depth of ground-layer combustion in 178 sites dominated by black spruce in Alaska, using data collected from 31 fire events between 1983 and 2005. We show that the depth of burning increased as the fire season progressed when the annual area burned was small. However, deep burning occurred throughout the fire season when the annual area burned was large. Depth of burning increased late in the fire season in upland forests, but not in peatland and permafrost sites. Simulations of wildfire-induced carbon losses from Alaskan black spruce stands over the past 60 years suggest that ground-layer combustion has accelerated regional carbon losses over the past decade, owing to increases in burn area and late-season burning. As a result, soils in these black spruce stands have become a net source of carbon to the atmosphere, with carbon emissions far exceeding decadal uptake.

AB Climate change is projected to increase mean temperature of northern lakes by the end of the twenty-first century. To simulate this scenario, during 2004-2007 we imposed artificial mixing in Halsjarvi, a small, polyhumic, boreal lake in southern Finland, to increase the depth of the thermocline by similar to 1.5 m. The aims of the experiment were to evaluate potential effects of climate change on biogeochemical cycles, especially of mercury, and on food web structure, productivity and biodiversity in dystrophic lake ecosystems. Following the initial depression of the thermocline in the experimental lake, the methyl mercury (MeHg) concentration in small European perch (Perca fluviatlis L.) decreased and remained lower throughout the study. In contrast, perch in a nearby reference lake exhibited increased MeHg during the same period. The delta(15)N values of the muscle tissue of perch were similar in both lakes over the study period, suggesting that the trophic position of perch remained unchanged. However, delta(13)C values of perch became clearly more negative in Halsjarvi, probably due to the greater mixing of the water column that resulted in changes in the carbon sources for the food web. A marked decrease of epilimnetic MeHg concentrations recorded during the experiment was considered to be the main reason for the decreased MeHg concentrations in perch. The results suggest that oxygen-related changes induced by climate change will be more important than direct temperature changes for MeHg accumulation in fish in small humic lakes with persistent oxygen deficiency in the hypolimnion.

AB Peat bogs have historically represented exceptional carbon (C) sinks because of their extremely low decomposition rates and consequent accumulation of plant remnants as peat. Among the factors favoring that peat accumulation, a major role is played by the chemical quality of plant litter itself, which is poor in nutrients and characterized by polyphenols with a strong inhibitory effect on microbial breakdown. Because bogs receive their nutrient supply solely from atmospheric deposition, the global increase of atmospheric nitrogen (N) inputs as a consequence of human activities could potentially alter the litter chemistry with important, but still unknown, effects on their C balance. Here we present data showing the decomposition rates of recently formed litter peat samples collected in nine European countries under a natural gradient of atmospheric N deposition from approximate to 0.2 to 2 g center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1). We found that enhanced decomposition rates for material accumulated under higher atmospheric N supplies resulted in higher carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and dissolved organic carbon release. The increased IN availability favored microbial decomposition (i) by removing N constraints on microbial metabolism and (ii) through a chemical amelioration of litter peat quality with a positive feedback on microbial enzymatic activity. Although some uncertainty remains about whether decay-resistant Sphagnum will continue to dominate litter peat, our data indicate that, even without such changes, increased N deposition poses a serious risk to our valuable peatland C sinks.

AB Peatlands occupy 20% of the land area of Ireland and store over half of soil carbon stocks. Over 80% of these peatlands have been disturbed by human activity such as drainage for peat extraction, afforestation and agriculture. In this study, peat samples were collected from 12 horticultural peat extraction sites in the Irish midlands. The carbon (C), nitrogen (N), hydrogen and sulphur content were determined, and from these, the carbon oxidation state (C-ox) and oxidative ratio (OR) were calculated. The carbon oxidation ratio reflects organic matter synthesis and degradation, and is thus an important parameter in understanding terrestrial carbon cycling, whilst OR represents the molar ratio of oxygen (O-2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes associated with net ecosystem exchange. Elemental concentrations and ratios were typical for Irish horticultural peat (e.g. carbon concentrations 54%-57%), though showed site to site variability. C(ox)and OR values varied between -0.22 and -0.11, and 1.04 and 1.07, respectively, and were comparable to United Kingdom peat soils. All values for OR were lower than 1.1, the value commonly used in global CO(2)partitioning studies. Further research should investigate OR values in peatland which has not been studied to date. Across all sites, measures of increased decomposition (i.e. C/N ratios) significantly correlated with increasing OR reflecting more reduced organic matter. This study provides data in temperate peat soils that increases the coverage of C(ox)and OR values and will inform global CO(2)partitioning studies.

AB Question: We studied vegetation succession after drainage in a bog, as an analogue for potential persistent water table drawdown due to climate change. We asked: (1) how does bog vegetation change following a long-term water table lowering and (2) how are effects of drainage on hydrology and vegetation distributed temporally and spatially?
   Location: Mer Bleue peatland, Ontario, Canada (45.41 degrees N, 75.48 degrees W).
   Methods: Analyses of changes in vegetation and hydrology associated with drainage were examined spatially along a hydrosequence and temporally using paleoecological reconstructions from peat cores (testate amoebae, pollen) in a drained portion of a peatland untouched for 85 years following drainage. Relationships between modern vegetation and water table were assessed through clustering and ordination analyses of vegetation releves.
   Results: Post-drainage increases in tree cover, especially Betula and Larix, decreases in Sphagnum cover and shifts in species composition of dominant shrubs were observed. Present-day vegetation patterns along the hydrosequence were primarily related to seasonal variability of water table depth. Paleoecological records reveal that where the present-day vegetation has been impacted by drainage, persistent water table lowering occurred in response to drainage. However, in an area with relatively natural vegetation, a transient drop in water table depth occurred at the time of drainage.
   Conclusions: Temporal and spatial patterns revealed that the bog response to drainage was spatially and temporally heterogeneous, and probably mediated by feedbacks among vegetation, peat structure and hydrology. Spatial patterns along the hydrosequence were similar to those observed in paleoecological reconstructions, but the use of the two complementary techniques provides additional insights.

AB We present here radiocarbon dating results from two boreal lakes in Finland, which are permanently (meromictic) or seasonally stratified and contain continuous sequences of annually laminated sediments that started to form in the early Holocene. The radiocarbon dating results of different organic components were compared with the varve-based sediment chronologies. The deviation between the Lake Valkiajarvi varve chronology (8400 varve years 2-3% error estimate) and 33 C-14 dates taken from insoluble and soluble organic phases vary inconsistently throughout the Holocene. In extreme cases mean calibrated radiocarbon dates with 95.4% confidence levels (2 sigma) are -2350 and +2040 years offset when compared with the varve chronology. On average, the radiocarbon dates are offset by ca. +550 years. The deviation between the Lake Nautajarvi varve chronology (9898 varve years +/- 1% error estimate) and 26 C-14 dates analyzed with conventional and AMS methods indicates that radiocarbon dates are systematically older by 500-1300 years (about 900 years on average). This significant offset mean that radiocarbon dates obtained from organic bulk sediment of meromictic and seasonally hypoxic lakes must be cautiously interpreted because of the reservoir effect and carbon cycling at the sediment-water interface. Direct evidence was obtained from the dating of soluble fraction and insoluble organic matter from near bottom water in the monimolimnion of Lake Valkiajarvi, which yielded C-14 ages of 560 +/- 80 BP and 2070 +/- 140 BP, respectively. Our study reinforces previous results that age-depth models based on bulk sediment radiocarbon dates obtained on sediments of stratified lakes are of limited value for accurate dating of changes in land use and especially the commence of agriculture.

AB Arctic soils contain large amounts of organic matter which, globally, exceed the amount of carbon stored in vegetation biomass and in the atmosphere. Recent studies emphasise the potential sensitivity for this soil organic matter (SOM) to be mineralised when faced with increasing ambient temperatures. In order to better refine the predictions about the response of SOM to climate warming, there is a need to increase the spatial coverage of empirical data on SOM quantity and quality in the Arctic area. This study provides, for the first time, a characterisation of SOM from the Gydan Peninsula in the Yamal Region, Western Siberia, Russia. On the one hand, soil humic acids and their humification state were characterised by measuring the elemental composition and diversity of functional groups using solidstate C-13-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Also, the total mineralisable carbon was measured. Our results indicate that there is a predominance of aliphatic carbon structures, with a minimal variation of their functional-group composition both regionally and within soil depth. This vertical homogeneity and low level of aromaticity reflects the accumulation in soil of lowly decomposed organic matter due to cold temperatures. Mineralisation rates were found to be independent of SOM quality, and to be mainly explained solely by the total carbon content. Overall, our results provide further evidence on the sensitivity that the soils of Western Siberia may have to increasing ambient temperatures and highlight the important role that this region can play in the global carbon balance under the effects of climate warming.

AB Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle and represent both an important stock of soil carbon and a substantial natural source of relevant greenhouse gases like CO2 and CH4. While it is known that the quality of organic matter affects microbial degradation and mineralization processes in peatlands, the manner in which the quality of peat organic matter affects the formation of CO2 and CH4 remains unclear. In this study we developed a fast and simple peat quality index in order to estimate its potential greenhouse gas formation by linking the thermo-degradability of peat with potential anaerobic CO2 and CH4 formation rates. Peat samples were obtained at several depths (0-40 cm) at four sampling locations from an acidic fen (pH 4.7). CO2 and CH4 formation rates were highly spatially variable and depended on depth, sampling location, and the composition of pyrolysable organic matter. Peat samples active in CO2 and CH4 formation had a quality index above 1.35, and the fraction of thermally labile pyrolyzable organic matter (comparable to easily available carbon substrates for microbial activity) obtained by thermogravimetry was above 35%. Curie-point pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry mainly identified carbohydrates and lignin as pyrolysis products in these samples, indicating that undecomposed organic matter was found in this fraction. In contrast, lipids and unspecific pyrolysis products, which indicate recalcitrant and highly decomposed organic matter, correlated significantly with lower CO2 formation and reduced methanogenesis. Our results suggest that undecomposed organic matter is a prerequisite for CH4 and CO2 development in acidic fens. Furthermore, the new peat quality index should aide the estimation of potential greenhouse gas formation resulting from peatland restoration and permafrost thawing and help yield more robust models of trace gas fluxes from peatlands for climate change research.

AB Producer-decomposer interactions within aquatic biofilms can range from mutualistic associations to competition depending on available resources. The outcomes of such interactions have implications for biogeochemical cycling and, as such, may be especially important in northern peatlands, which are a global carbon sink and are expected to experience changes in resource availability with climate change. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of nutrients and organic carbon on the relative proportion of primary producers (microalgae) and heterotrophic decomposers (bacteria and fungi) during aquatic biofilm development in a boreal peatland. Given that decomposers are often better competitors for nutrients than primary producers in aquatic ecosystems, we predicted that labile carbon subsidies would shift the biofilm composition towards heterotrophy owing to the ability of decomposers to outcompete primary producers for available nutrients in the absence of carbon limitation.
   We manipulated nutrients (nitrate and phosphate) and organic carbon (glucose) in a full factorial design using nutrient-diffusing substrates in an Alaskan fen.
   Heterotrophic bacteria were limited by organic carbon and algae were limited by inorganic nutrients. However, the outcomes of competitive interactions depended on background nutrient levels. Heterotrophic bacteria were able to outcompete algae for available nutrients when organic carbon was elevated and nutrient levels remained low, but not when organic carbon and nutrients were both elevated through enrichment.
   Fungal biomass was significantly lower in the presence of glucose alone, possibly owing to antagonistic interactions with heterotrophic bacteria. In contrast to bacteria, fungi were stimulated along with algae following nutrient enrichment.
   The decoupling of algae and heterotrophic bacteria in the presence of glucose alone shifted the biofilm trophic status towards heterotrophy. This effect was overturned when nutrients were enriched along with glucose, owing to a subsequent increase in algal biomass in the absence of nutrient limitation.
   By measuring individual components of the biofilm and obtaining data on the trophic status, we have begun to establish a link between resource availability and biofilm formation in northern peatlands. Our results show that labile carbon subsidies from outside sources have the potential to disrupt microbial coupling and shift the metabolic balance in favour of heterotrophy. The extent to which this occurs in the future will probably depend on the timing and composition of bioavailable nutrients delivered to surface waters with environmental change (e.g. permafrost thaw).

AB Feedbacks to global warming may cause terrestrial ecosystems to add to anthropogenic CO2 emissions, thus exacerbating climate change. The contribution that soil respiration makes to these terrestrial emissions, particularly from carbon-rich soils such as peatlands, is of significant importance and its response to changing climatic conditions is of considerable debate. We collected intact soil cores from an upland blanket bog situated within the northern Pennines, England, UK and investigated the individual and interactive effects of three primary controls on soil organic matter decomposition: (i) temperature (5, 10 and 15 degrees C); (ii) moisture (50 and 100% field capacity - FC); and (iii) substrate quality, using increasing depth from the surface (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm) as an analogue for increased recalcitrance of soil organic material. Statistical analysis of the results showed that temperature, moisture and substrate quality all significantly affected rates of peat decomposition. Q(10) values indicated that the temperature sensitivity of older/more recalcitrant soil organic matter significantly increased (relative to more labile peat) under reduced soil moisture (50% FC) conditions, but not under 100% FC, suggesting that soil microorganisms decomposing the more recalcitrant soil material preferred more aerated conditions. Radiocarbon analyses revealed that soil decomposers were able to respire older, more recalcitrant soil organic matter and that the source of the material (deduced from the delta C-13 analyses) subject to decomposition, changed depending on depth in the peat profile.

AB 1. Components of the CO2 balance for a drained minerotrophic fen and a drained ombrotrophic bog were measured for permanent plots using static chamber techniques for 1 year before and 2 years after a rewetting treatment in part of both sites. During the same period, changes in ground and bottom layer vegetation composition were monitored.
   2. After the treatment, the water table rose, the average increase being 25 cm for the fen site and 20 cm for the bog site. In the untreated areas the average water table remained at the pretreatment level.
   3. There was a clear change in vegetation composition in the rewetted area of the fen site where the cover of cottongrass Eriophorum vaginatum L. increased drastically. The change in vegetation composition seemed to be dependent on the nutrient status of the sites, being faster at the more nutrient-rich fen site.
   4. The rates of CO2 efflux from the soil surface decreased on those rewetted plots where all vegetation had been removed. In 1996, the CO2 efflux rates from the soil surface of the untreated plots were about twice as high as from the rewetted plots with a high water table.
   5. The change in water table levels and vegetation composition affected the seasonal (mid-May to end of September) CO2-C balances. For the rewetted area of the fen site, the CO2-C balance varied from 162 to 283 g m(-2), being greatest in a plot with dense E. vaginatum cover and a high water table. For the rewetted area of the bog site, the CO2-C balance varied from 54 to 101 g m(-2), being greatest in a hollow-level plot with a high water table and mire vegetation. For the untreated areas, the CO2-C balance was close to zero (3 g m(-2) at the bog site) or negative (-183 g m(-2) at the fen site), when carbon fixation by the tree stand was omitted.
   6. The results are encouraging from the practical point of view as restoration of both fen and bog sites initiated vegetation succession and CO2-C balance development towards those of pristine mires.

AB Peatland restoration may provide a potential after-use option to mitigate the negative climate impact of abandoned peat extraction areas; currently, however, knowledge about restoration effects on the annual balances of carbon (C) and greenhouse gas (GHG) exchanges is still limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of contrasting mean water table levels (WTLs) on the annual C and GHG balances of restoration treatments with high (Res(H)) and low (Res(L)) WTL relative to an unrestored bare peat (BP) site. Measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were conducted over a full year using the closed chamber method and complemented by measurements of abiotic controls and vegetation cover. Three years following restoration, the difference in the mean WTL resulted in higher bryophyte and lower vascular plant cover in Res(H) relative to Res(L). Consequently, greater gross primary production and autotrophic respiration associated with greater vascular plant cover were observed in Res(L) compared to Res(H). However, the means of the measured net ecosystem CO2 exchanges (NEE) were not significantly different between Res(H) and Res(L). Similarly, no significant differences were observed in the respective means of CH4 and N2O exchanges. In comparison to the two restored sites, greater net CO2, similar CH4 and greater N2O emissions occurred in BP. On the annual scale, Res(H), Res(L) and BP were C sources of 111, 103 and 268 g Cm-2 yr(-1) and had positive GHG balances of 4.1, 3.8 and 10.2 tCO(2) eq ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Thus, the different WTLs had a limited impact on the C and GHG balances in the two restored treatments 3 years following restoration. However, the C and GHG balances in Res(H) and Res(L) were considerably lower than in BP due to the large reduction in CO2 emissions. This study therefore suggests that restoration may serve as an effective method to mitigate the negative climate impacts of abandoned peat extraction areas.

AB Sea-level rise coupled with land subsidence from wetland drainage exposes increasingly large areas of coastal peatlands to seawater intrusion. Seawater contains high concentrations of sulfate (SO42-), which can alter the decomposition of organic matter thereby releasing organic and inorganic solutes from peat. In this study, a flow-through reactor system was used in order to examine the transport of SO42- through peat as well as its effect on solute release. Moderately-decomposed fen peat samples received input solutions with SO42- concentrations of 0, 100, 700, and 2,700mg L-1; sample effluent was analyzed for a variety of geochemical parameters including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) as well as the concentrations of major cations and anions. The input solution remained anoxic throughout the experiment; however, no signs of a pronounced SO42- reduction were detected in the effluent. SO42- transport in the fen peat resembled non-reactive bromide (Br-) transport, indicating that in the absence of SO42- reduction the anion may be considered a conservative tracer. However, slightly elevated concentrations of DOC and TDN, associated with raised SO42- levels, suggest the minor desorption of organic acids through anion exchange. An increased solute release due to stimulated decomposition processes, including SO42- reduction, was observed for samples with acetate as an additional marine carbon source included in their input solution. The solute release of peats with different degrees of decomposition differed greatly under SO42--enriched conditions where strongly-decomposed fen peat samples released the highest concentrations of DOC, DIC and TDN.

AB The assessment of carbon balance in forest soils of the Leningrad administrative area (south boreal sub-zone of east European plain) has been carried out using: (1) previous data on carbon pools of forest soils without considering mires area as initial data (organic layer plus 50 cm soil); (2) inventory data on forest stands that has been converted into biomass and data on litter input; (3) meteorological data concerning the mean monthly air temperature and precipitation. The most recent model version of soil organic matter (SOMM) dynamics was applied for a 100-year simulation of carbon dynamics in the 3.22 x 10(6) ha of forest soils of the Leningrad area considering a constant forest-age structure and climate. The results demonstrate unique carbon dynamics in various soils, and an 8% increase of the total carbon pool of the area's forest soils during the 100-year simulation (from 266 to 286 million tons of carbon). The total carbon input to the soil, in the form of litter carbon, was 8.3 million tons annually, and the carbon emission, in the form of carbon dioxide released from the soils, was 8.1 million tons annually at the end of simulation.

AB Peatlands in northern Ontario, Canada, archive multiple biological indicators, including macrofossils, algae, testate amoebae, and pollen. These proxies can provide insights concerning the timing and nature of long-term climatic and environmental changes. The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) of central Canada contain one of Earth's largest continuous peatland complexes, and thus comprehensive spatial and temporal studies are needed to understand the implications of climate change on carbon cycling. Diatom assemblages were examined in three cores retrieved from ombrotrophic bogs across two Canadian terrestrial ecozones. Comparisons were made with testate amoebae and macrofossil data previously analyzed from these cores, as well as with regional pollen records from surrounding peatlands. From 2000 to 600 cal. BP, changes in diatom composition likely reflect hydrosere succession within the peatland, including fluctuations in connectivity to the water table and pH changes. From 600 cal. BP to present, the synchronous timing of changes in diatoms and testate amoebae are tracking drying conditions and subsequent microhabitat variations that occur within bogs. It is possible that diatoms are tracking subtle changes in the stability of peat microforms including bog hollows and hummocks, highlighting their sensitivity to small chemical change, whereas testate amoebae are tracking the lowering of a peatland water table and subsequent drying of the peatland. The use of multiple proxies provides a more holistic approach to interpreting past ecological succession and responses to climate within peatlands. When present and well preserved, diatoms can be applied to track drying conditions in bogs, in terms of both hydrosere succession and present climatic change.

AB Permafrost thaw resulting from climate warming may dramatically change the succession and carbon dynamics of northern ecosystems. To examine the joint effects of regional temperature and local species changes on peat accumulation following thaw, we studied peat accumulation across a regional gradient of mean annual temperature (MAT). We measured aboveground net primary production (AGNPP) and decomposition over 2 years for major functional groups and used these data to calculate a simple index of net annual aboveground peat accumulation. In addition, we collected cores from six adjacent frozen and thawed bog sites to document peat accumulation changes following thaw over the past 200 years. Aboveground biomass and decomposition were more strongly controlled by local succession than regional climate. AGNPP for some species differed between collapse scars and associated permafrost plateaus and was influenced by regional MAT. A few species, such as Picea mariana trees on frozen bogs and Sphagnum mosses in thawed bogs, sequestered a disproportionate amount of peat; in addition, changes in their abundance following thaw changed peat accumulation. Pb-210-dated cores indicated that peat accumulation doubles following thaw and that the accumulation rate is affected by historical changes in species during succession. Peat accumulation in boreal peatlands following thaw was controlled by a complex mix of local vegetation changes, regional climate, and history. These results suggest that northern ecosystems may show responses more complex than large releases of carbon during transient warming.

AB Tundra ecosystems store vast amounts of soil organic carbon, which may be sensitive to climatic change. Net ecosystem production, NEP, is the net exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) between landscapes and the atmosphere, and represents the balance between CO2 uptake by photosynthesis and release by decomposition and autotrophic respiration. Here we examine CO2 exchange across seven sites in the Canadian low and high Arctic during the peak growing season (July) in summer 2008. All sites were net sinks for atmospheric CO2 (NEP ranged from 5 to 67 g C m(-2)), with low Arctic sites being substantially larger CO2 sinks. The spatial difference in NEP between low and high Arctic sites was determined more by CO2 uptake via gross ecosystem production than by CO2 release via ecosystem respiration. Maximum gross ecosystem production at the low Arctic sites (average 8.6 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) was about 4 times larger than for high Arctic sites (average 2.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). NEP decreased with increasing temperature at all low Arctic sites, driven largely by the ecosystem respiration response. No consistent temperature response was found for the high Arctic sites. The results of this study clearly indicate there are large differences in tundra CO2 exchange between high and low Arctic environments and this difference should be a central consideration in studies of Arctic carbon balance and climate change.

AB Thermokarst lakes are widely distributed on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), which accounts for 8% of the global permafrost area. These lakes probably promote organic matter biodegradation and thus accelerate the emission of carbon-based greenhouse gases. However, little is known about greenhouse gas concentrations and their stable isotopes characteristics of these lakes. In this study, we measured the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved CO2 and CH4, as well as the distribution of delta C-13(CO2), delta C-13(CH4), and delta C-13(OM) (organic matter) of lake sediments in thermokarst lakes on the QTP. Results showed that the OM of the lake sediments was highly decomposed. The concentrations of DOC, CO2 and CH4 in the lake water on the QTP were 1.2-49.6 mg L-1, 3.6-45.0 mu mol L-1 and 0.28-3.0 mu mol L-1, respectively. The highest CO2 and CH4 concentrations were recorded in July while the lowest values in September, which suggested that temperature had an effect on greenhouse gas production, although this pattern may also relate to thermal stratification of the water column. The results implied that thermokast lakes should be paid more attention to regarding carbon cycle and greenhouse gas emissions on the QTP.

AB Our study investigated the concentration of dissolved carbon at the point when water leaves the pedosphere and whether this amount represents a significant proportion of terrestrial carbon cycling. The investigations were carried out in a temperate forest catchment (Black Forest, Germany) over a period of I year. The annual export of dissolved C compounds (14.4 g C m(-2) year I) was dominated by CO2 (9.7 vs. 4.7 g C m(-2) year(-1) DOC). Even though the direct CO2 degassing at the spring was inferior (0.4 kg C year(-1)), considerably lower CO2 concentrations were measured 17 m downstream of the spring. This shows that a large proportion of dissolved CO2 (93%) originating from the pedosphere is not captured anymore within a short distance from the spring. The measured lateral C-transport was in the same order of magnitude as reported for the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) observed for German spruce forests (-4 to -55 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Therefore, the results clearly demonstrated that the lateral transport of dissolved carbon can be a significant part of terrestrial carbon budgets and for this study site CO2 was dominating this 'indirect' pathway. However, for generalisation, it is important to extend this investigation to other landscapes and climatic zones. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Ombrotrophic raised bogs are nutrient poor acidic peatlands accumulating organic matter. They are widely spread on northern latitudes and are substantial sources of methane emissions to the atmosphere being of great concern from a climate change perspective. We investigated the methanogen community composition along microtopographic gradients within three bogs in Scandinavia, receiving different amounts of nitrogen precipitation. Methanogenic community analyses by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of the mcrA gene showed different profiles among the three sites, while no influence of the rnicrotopographic gradients was observed. Peat temperature and dissolved organic carbon were the major edaphic variables explaining 38% of the variation of the methanogenic community diversity among the bogs. The family Methanoregulaceae (hydrogenotrophic methanogens) showed the largest relative proportion and highest activity in all three sites. Quantitative PCR of the mcrA gene and transcripts showed that the most northern site, receiving the lowest atmospheric nitrogen load, had significantly lower abundance and activity of methanogens (4.7 x 10(6) and 2.4 x 10(4) mcrA copies per gram of soil, respectively), compared to the most southern site (8.2 x 10(7) and 4.6 x 10(5) mcrA copies per gram of soil, respectively), receiving the highest nitrogen load. No patterns of the mcrA gene and transcript abundances were observed along the microtopography. The results indicated that the difference in occurrence of methanogens is mainly due to geoclirnatological conditions rather than site intrinsic microtopographic variation. The study further suggests that environmental changes on the site intrinsic topography will not affect the methanogenic activity, while increasing average temperatures in Scandinavian ombrotrophic raised bogs might contribute to an increase of the methanogenic archaeal activity resulting in an increase of methane production.

AB Constructed wetlands (CW), widely used to remove nutrients from runoff waters, transform some of the carbon and nitrogen they receive into greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), and may therefore have adverse atmospheric impacts. We studied seasonal and temporal changes in C degradation and emissions of CH4 and N2O of a boreal CW used to purify peat mining runoff waters 5 (in 1992) and 15 (in 2001-2002) years after construction. There was a remarkable change in the cycling of carbon in the wetland as the number of years in operation increased: the mean CH4 emission tripled from 140 to 400 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) and the mean CO2 release (respiration) doubled from 7270 to 13 600 mg CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in the 10-year period. The reasons for the increased C gas production were the increased plant biomass, which doubled in 10 years, and a 3 degrees C higher average temperature in 2002 than in 1992. The N2O fluxes did not change during the study period: the mean emissions were 340 and 450 mu g N2O m(-2) d(-1) in 1992 and 2002. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB When a peatland is drained and cultivated, it behaves as a notable source of CO2. However, we lack temporally and spatially explicit estimates of carbon losses from cultivated peatlands. Using a process-based land surface model that explicitly includes representation of peatland processes, we estimate that northern peatlands converted to croplands emitted 72 Pg C over 850-2010, with 45% of this source having occurred before 1750. This source surpassed the carbon accumulation by high-latitude undisturbed peatlands (36 to 47 Pg C). Carbon losses from the cultivation of northern peatlands are omitted in previous land-use emission assessments. Adding this ignored historical land-use emission implies an 18% larger terrestrial carbon storage since 1750 to close the historical global carbon budget. We also show that carbon emission per unit area decrease with time since drainage, suggesting that time since drainage should be accounted for in inventories to refine land- use emissions from cultivated peatlands.

AB High-latitude peatlands contain about one third of the world's soil organic carbon, most of which is derived from partly decomposed Sphagnum (peat moss) plants. We conducted a meta-analysis based on a global data set of Sphagnum growth measurements collected from published literature to investigate the effects of bioclimatic variables on Sphagnum growth. Analysis of variance and general linear models were used to relate Sphagnum magellanicum and S. fuscum growth rates to photosynthetically active radiation integrated over the growing season (PAR0) and a moisture index. We found that PAR0 was the main predictor of Sphagnum growth for the global data set, and effective moisture was only correlated with moss growth at continental sites. The strong correlation between Sphagnum growth and PAR0 suggests the existence of a global pattern of growth, with slow rates under cool climate and short growing seasons, highlighting the important role of growing season length in explaining peatland biomass production. Large-scale patterns of cloudiness during the growing season might also limit moss growth. Although considerable uncertainty remains over the carbon balance of peatlands under a changing climate, our results suggest that increasing PAR0 as a result of global warming and lengthening growing seasons, without major change in cloudiness, could promote Sphagnum growth. Assuming that production and decomposition have the same sensitivity to temperature, this enhanced growth could lead to greater peat-carbon sequestration, inducing a negative feedback to climate change.

AB Hydrological response to climate change may alter the biogeochemical role that peatlands play in the global climate system, so an understanding of the nature and magnitude of this response is important. In 2002, the water table in a fen peatland near Quebec City was lowered by similar to 20 cm (Experimental site), and hydrological response was measured compared to Control (no manipulation) and Drained (previously drained c. 1994) sites. Because of the draw-down, the surface in the Experimental pool decreased 5, 15 and 20 cm in the ridge, lawn and mat, respectively, increasing bulk density by similar to 60% in the Experimental lawn. Hydraulic conductivity (K) generally decreased with depth and from Control (25-125 cm) 10(-1) to 10(-5) cm s(-1) to Experimental (25-125 cm) 10(-2) to 10-7 cm s(-1) and to Drained (25-75 cm) 10(-2) to 10(-6) cm(-6) s(-1). In similar topographic locations (ridge, lawn, mat), K trended Control > Experimental > Drained, usually by an order of magnitude at similar depths in similar topographic locations. Water table fluctuations in the Drained site averaged twice those of the Control site. The water table in the Control lawn remained at a stable depth relative to the surface (similar to - 1 cm) because the lawn peat floats with changes in water table position. However, the Drained lawn peat was more rigid because of the denser degraded peat, forcing the water to fluctuate relative to the surface and further enhancing peat decay and densification. This provides a positive feedback loop that could intensify further peat degradation, changing the carbon cycling dynamics. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The aim of this study was to establish the main drivers of the spatial variability in growing season CH4 flux within an arctic wetland ecosystem. During 3 years (2011-2013) we measured CH4 flux and potential drivers, e.g., CO2 fluxes (net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration), temperature, water table depth, pore-water concentration of organic acids (e.g., acetate) and the vascular plant composition and density. The study included 16-20 main plots (C-main) and in 2013 also experimental plots (10 excluded muskoxen grazing, 9 snow fence and 10 automated chamber plots) distributed over 0.3 km(2). The results show a 1.8-times difference in CH4 flux magnitude inter-annually and 9- to 35-times spatially (depending on year and treatment). During all 3 years GPP was a strong driver of the variability in C-main plots. Accordingly, the plant productivity related variables NEE, GPP and acetate were singled out as the strongest drivers of the variability in 2013, when all variables were measured on a majority of the plots. These variables were equally strong drivers of the spatial variability in CH4 flux regardless of whether experimental plots were included in the analysis or not. The density of Eriophorum scheuchzeri was the strongest driver of the spatial variability in NEE, GPP and acetate. In conclusion, changes in vegetation composition or productivity of wet arctic ecosystems will have large impacts on their carbon balance and CH4 flux, irrespective of whether these changes are driven directly by climate change or by biotic interactions, such as grazing.

AB South Patagonian peat bogs are little studied sources of methane (CH4). Since CH4 fluxes can vary greatly on a small scale of meters, high-quality maps are needed to accurately quantify CH4 fluxes from bogs. We used high-resolution color infrared (CIR) images captured by an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) to investigate potential uncertainties in total ecosystem CH4 fluxes introduced by the classification of the surface area. An object-based approach was used to classify vegetation both on species and microform level. We achieved an overall Kappa Index of Agreement (KIA) of 0.90 for the species- and 0.83 for the microform-level classification, respectively. CH4 fluxes were determined by closed chamber measurements on four predominant microforms of the studied bog. Both classification approaches were employed to up-scale CH4 closed chamber measurements in a total area of around 1.8 hectares. Including proportions of the surface area where no chamber measurements were conducted, we estimated a potential uncertainty in ecosystem CH4 fluxes introduced by the classification of the surface area. This potential uncertainty ranged from 14.2 mg center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1) to 26.8 mg center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1). Our results show that a simple classification with only few classes potentially leads to pronounced bias in total ecosystem CH4 fluxes when plot-scale fluxes are up-scaled.

AB Peatlands cover very large extents in northern regions and play a significant role in the global carbon cycle by functioning as a carbon sink. Large-scale satellite based monitoring systems, such as the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI), are necessary to improve our understanding of how these ecosystems respond to climate change by providing verifiable land products. For instance, satellite-based land product validation approaches can benefit from airborne hyperspectral imagery and in-situ data, which provide higher spatial and spectral resolution baselines, ideal for measuring vegetation changes (e.g. phenology, LAI) at local scales. Here, we assessed the short-term phenospectral dynamics (spectral changes indicated by specific spectral features as a function of phenology) of five ombrotrophic peatland vegetation physiognomies over four dates at the Mer Bleue bog in Canada. We took advantage of a unique remote sensing data acquisition campaign aiming to validate Sentinel-2A land products, and analyzed three spatially and spectrally distinctive datasets (i.e. field spectra, VISNIR airborne hyperspectral imagery (HSI) and Sentinel-2A imagery) over the first half of the 2016 growing season. By implementing a bottom-up approach, first we assessed the airborne HSI's capability to detect phenological changes as compared to in-situ acquired field spectroscopy measurements in a 10 ha area at Mer Bleue and evaluated the spectral features characteristic of these phenological changes. Second, over the entire Mer Bleue area (28,000 ha), we compared a series of four Sentinel-2A images to four airborne HSI mosaics (spatially and spectrally resampled to Sentinel-2A) to assess the utility of Sentinel-2A for detecting small spectral variations due to phenological changes (i.e. greening). In addition, for this second comparison, three spectral vegetation indices were derived from the Sentinel-2A images and the airborne HSI mosaics. The spectral comparisons between the airborne HSI and the field spectroscopy data revealed clear phenological changes from the airborne HSI. For instance, a closer agreement between reflectance measured by the field spectrometer and the airborne HSI spectral response was found in the visible region (450-680 nm). A greater difference however, was consistently seen in the near-infrared region (681-866 nm) across the four dates. Narrow spectral features in three regions of the visible range (global minima, red absorption, green peak), indicating changes in vegetation colour, were consistent for both datasets and with expected phenological patterns at Mer Bleue. At the landscape level, Sentinel-2A mirrored the spectral changes depicted by the resampled HSI data. However, band level, pair-wise comparisons showed significant differences (p < 0.001) in reflectance for each band, with Sentinel-2A exhibiting higher reflectance values than the HSI for the first three dates. Only for the last date (June 23rd) did the airborne HSI have higher reflectance values or no significant difference with the Sentinel-2A data. Overall, our three datasets captured the short-term phenological changes at Mer Bleue and have provided promising results in terms of using the Sentinel-2A MSI sensor to monitor these changes at the landscape level.

AB This study examines the recovery of the microbial compartment following active restoration of a North American ombrotrophic peatland extracted for horticultural peat-based substrates and restored by the Sphagnum moss transfer method. We used phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) to portrait the microbial community structure and Community Level Physiological Profiles (CLPP) to describe the functional diversity of the microbial communities. Our results indicate that the PLFA profiles were different between the beginning and the end of the growing season, but that it was impossible to distinguish five different vegetation classes found along the disturbance-recovery gradient on the basis of the microbial community structure. The pH, the cover of mosses, Ledum groenlandicum and Erlophorum vaginatum var. spissum were the best environmental predictors for the PLFA composition. The newly formed peat found in aerobic conditions beneath restored Sphagnum carpets had the highest decomposition capacity, whereas the lowest rates were found in the surface samples of non-restored conditions or in the deepest horizons of the natural samples. A large proportion of the variation in the physiological profiles was explained with variables related to the vegetation cover, the physicochemical environment and the microbial structure of the community, which is very promising for future monitoring studies. Overall, this study demonstrates that the recovery of particular plant groups, namely mosses and shrubs in restored peatlands might be the driver of changes occurring in the structure of the microbial communities in restored peatlands.

AB The present study comparatively analyses local and supra-local strategies for sustainable development of multifunctional fen landscapes in Germany (five strategies), the Netherlands (six strategies) and the UK (seven strategies)thereby filling a gap in the existing academic literature. Fen landscapes have a peat soil which may be irreversibly lost once decomposed. These landscapes are currently under pressure due to drainage and land-use changes. A variety of strategies is applied and no particular type of strategy dominates in efforts to achieve sustainability. Such variety may be explained by differences in national policy contexts, decision-making and designing traditions, and, views on urgency and priorities of sustainability issues. Yet, the landscapes of our research focus exist in the organized mutual context of the European Union. Our study provides essential characteristics of steering interventions, to be considered by European policy-makers, when supporting initiatives for sustainable development of these landscapes. These include: focus on slowing down peat loss by reserving about 20-30% of an area for rewetting and/or nature conservation; development of a long-term vision; facilitation of a fair, transparent, inclusive and careful negotiation process on goals, means and sacrifices.

AB The timing of the disappearance of the snow cover in spring, or snow melt day (SMD), is a key parameter controlling the carbon dioxide balance between the northern mire and heath ecosystems and the atmosphere. We present a simple method for the determination of the SMD using a satellite-based surface albedo product (SAL). The method is based on the local change of albedo from higher wintertime values towards the lower summertime values. The satellite SMD timing correlates well with the SMD determined from snow depth measurements at Finnish weather stations (r = 0.86, slope 1.05). In 50% of the cases the error was 3.4 days or less and bias less than half a day. This would lead to a moderate uncertainty in the annual CO2 balance of mire and heath ecosystems, if the published SMD-CO2 balance relations are valid. However, due to the limited data sets available a systematic validation is left for the future.

AB Actively growing mires have high conservation value and the potential to sequester carbon. However, drainage, burning, overgrazing and atmospheric pollution have led to depauperation of native flora and loss of peat at many peatland sites. In order to counteract such degradation, palaeoecological techniques can be applied and the data then used to inform nature conservation practice. The present study exemplifies this approach and was conducted on degraded blanket mire in Yorkshire, UK, in collaboration with a field-based moorland restoration agency. High-resolution, multiproxy palaeoecological analyses on a peat core from Oxenhope Moor were used to reconstruct Holocene vegetation changes spanning approximately the last 7000 years. Humification, pollen, plant macrofossil and charcoal analyses show distinct changes in species composition and indicate their potential causes. Human-induced changes identified at 2100 cal. BP are most likely to reflect deliberate clearance by fire. Sphagnum imbricatum disappears and is subsequently replaced by S. papillosum at ca. 1000 cal. BP, possibly due to drier conditions and competition between the two species. Increased human activity is identified since the Industrial Revolution where monocots and Eriophorum vaginatum increase, interpreted as a result of managed burning. It is intended that the long-term ecological history of the site, derived using palaeoecological techniques, will be used to inform conservation practice and can help set feasible targets for restoration and conservation. Specifically, encouraging a species mix that has pre-19th century longevity is suggested, including the specific recommendation that translocation of S. imbricatum be explored experimentally at this site, with a view to ascertaining likely success elsewhere.

AB Experimental flooding of a boreal forest wetland caused the wetland to change from being a small, natural carbon sink, with respect to the atmosphere, of -6.6 g of C m(-2) yr(-1) to a large source of +130 g of C m(-2) yr(-1). This change was caused by the death of the vegetation, which eliminated the photosynthetic CO2 sink and stimulated the microbial production of CO2 and CH4 from decomposition of plant tissues and peat. Another type of microbial activity that increased was the methylation of inorganic mercury to the much more toxic methyl mercury (MeHg) form. The wetland was a source of MeHg prior to flooding and became an even larger source (39 fold) after flooding. MeHg concentrations in the water sometimes exceeded 2 ng L-1, with the average being 0.9 ng L-1 in the first 2 years after flooding. MeHg also increased in the flooded vegetation and peat, in lower food chain organisms, and in fish. Two recommendations, which should minimize both greenhouse gas production and MeHg production in reservoirs, can be made: (1) minimize the total area of land flooded (i.e., avoid flooding areas of low relief) and (2) minimize the flooding of wetlands, which contain larger quantities of organic carbon than uplands and are sites of intense production of MeHg.

AB Thawing permafrost in the Canadian Arctic tundra leads to peat erosion and slumping in narrow and shallow runnel ponds that surround more commonly studied polygonal ponds. Here we compared the methane production between runnel and polygonal ponds using stable isotope ratios, C-14 signatures, and investigated potential methanogenic communities through high-throughput sequencing archaeal 16S rRNA genes. We found that runnel ponds had significantly higher methane and carbon dioxide emissions, produced from a slightly larger fraction of old carbon, compared to polygonal ponds. The methane stable isotopic signature indicated production through acetoclastic methanogenesis, but gene signatures from acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic Archaea were detected in both polygonal and runnel ponds. We conclude that runnel ponds represent a source of methane from potentially older C, and that they contain methanogenic communities able to use diverse sources of carbon, increasing the risk of augmented methane release under a warmer climate.

AB The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of medium pH and the influence of different graded concentrations of sucrose, fructose and glucose on the regeneration and development of Dianthus giganteiformis subsp. kladovanus grown on media with MS and half-strength MS salts, using different explant types. The results showed that the mean number of axillary buds and the number and length of shoots were significantly influenced by medium pH change and explant type, but the reduced concentration of MS salts did not have effect on those parameters. However, the significant interactions between the explant type and MS salt concentration or medium pH, which affected the mean number of axillary buds and shoots were recorded. The sugar type and its concentration significantly affected shoot development, and the highest number of shoots and axillary buds were obtained on the media containing 10 g L-1 or 30 g L-1 sucrose or 30 g L-1 glucose, while fructose showed poorer results. The longest shoots were developed on media with lower concentrations of sugars, and the best results were obtained on the media with 10 g L-1 and 30 g L-1 glucose. The concentration of NAA neither affected the rooting rate nor the number and length of roots, but explant type and MS salt concentration influenced rooting. For the optimal results, shoot cuttings with 1 to 4 nodes should be rooted on half-strength MS medium without auxine, and the obtained microplants should be acclimatized in a 4:1 mixture of peat and sand. When this protocol of propagation was used, the rooting rate was 95% and the acclimatization rate reached 90%.

AB The rates of carbon (C) accumulation and the role of fires in the C dynamics of the major types of boreal West Siberian mires were investigated. Detailed analysis of dry bulk density, C, and N concentration and age of the peat layers were used to determine C accumulation rates throughout the Holocene. The average long-term apparent rate of carbon accumulation (LORCA) at 11 studied sites was 17.2 +/-1.0 (SE) g m(-2) yr(-1), ranging from 12.1 to 23.7 g m(-2) yr(-1), and the total apparent carbon sink 11.8 Tg yr(-1) (1 Tg = 10(12) g) for Russian raised string bogs (68.5 million hectares). These estimates of C accumulation in West Siberian mires are roughly a half of the earlier estimates for these boreal mires. Differences in LORCA for three major mire types in the study area, the ridge-hollow pine bogs, Sphagnum fuscum pine bogs, and dwarf-shrub pine bogs, were not significant. The age versus depth (measured as cumulative carbon from the surface downward) curve was slightly convex, indicating a general declining trend in LORCA with decreasing age. About 55% of the present carbon store was already accumulated about 6000 cal. BP. The most intensive expansion phase of the study area occurred between 7000 and 8000 cal. BP. The subsequent lateral expansion has been very slow in the later Holocene. The charcoal data indicated that these mires have burned only 2-3 times during the past 7000-8000 cal. BP, and only a strip of a few meters along the mire margins has burned relatively frequently No evidence of significant carbon losses due to fires could be found. The charcoal layers at the mire margins suggest a declining trend in burning rates during the later Holocene.

AB Construction of road embankments in peatlands commonly involves replacement of the peat with a fill-up soil of an adequate load-bearing capacity. This usually requires a lowering of the water level, turning a peatland from a carbon sink to a source of greenhouse gases. Thus, alternatives are sought that are less costly in both economic and ecological terms. Mass-stabilization technology can provide a cheap substitute for Portland cement. Calcareous ashes (waste materials), supplemented with pozzolanic and alkali additives to facilitate and accelerate the setting and hardening processes, are attractive alternatives to soil excavation or replacement techniques. Silica fume and waterglass were used as pozzolanic agents and KOH as a soil-alkalizing agent. X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses and stress-strain tests were performed for the hardened samples. Crystallization of alkali feldspars was observed in all test samples. Comparable hardening of peat soil was achieved for both ashes. It was shown that the ashes of Estonian kukersite (oil shale) from both pulverized firing and a circulating fluidized bed incineration process (produced in energy sector as quantitatively major solid waste in Estonia) can be used as binding agents for peat stabilization, even without the addition of Portland cement. Hardened peat soil samples behaved as a ductile material, and the cellulose fibers naturally present in peat gave the peat-ash composite plasticity, acting mechanically in the same way as the steel or glass fiber in ordinary reinforced concrete. The effect of peat fiber reinforcement was higher in cases of higher load and displacement of the composite, making the material usable in ecological constructions.

AB Restoration of drained peatlands has been promoted to reduce gaseous and aquatic carbon losses; however, there are conflicting reports as to its effectiveness. Here we report "hotspots" of organic matter decomposition as a result of rewetting a drained peatland in Wales, at the field-scale, in the medium/long-term with implications for water quality and greenhouse gas emissions. Low soil moisture levels, that characterise these hotspots before rewetting, regenerate electron acceptors and provide carbon and nutrients which stimulate phenol oxidase-mediated release of phenolic compounds from the peat matrix upon waterlogging. Electron acceptors are then consumed sequentially, eventually favouring CH(4) production and rising pH, despite accumulating SO(4) levels. The latter two processes promote positive feedback to increased phenol oxidase activities and the release of even more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and CH(4) from the peat matrix. Hotspot formation therefore represents an inextricably linked physico-chemical and biological positive feedback mechanism. Such hotspots account for a large proportion of the mean increase in carbon loss due to rewetting of this naturally drained peatland (e.g. at maximum mean DOC concentrations: with hotspot 997%; without hotspot 102%) and are not "outliers" but important drivers of biogeochemical fluxes that should be included in budgets for carbon and other elements (e.g. sulphur). As such, understanding hotspot formation should allow improved management strategies for restoration, carbon stocks, drinking water quality and even future geo-engineering options in the face of changes in climate and atmospheric chemistry.

AB Inspired by the importance of Redfield-type C : N : P ratios in global soils, we looked for analogous patterns in peatlands and aimed at deciphering the potential affecting factors. By analyzing a suite of peatlands soil data (n = 1031), mean soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP) contents were 50.51%, 1.45% and 0.13%, respectively, while average C : N, C : P and N : P ratios were 26.72, 1186.00 and 46.58, respectively. C : N ratios showed smaller variations across different vegetation coverage and had less spatial heterogeneity than C : P and N:P ratios. No consistent C : N : P ratio, though with a general value of 1245 : 47 : 1, was found for entire peatland soils in China. The Northeast China, Tibet, Zoig Plateau and parts of Xinjiang had high soil SOC, TN, TP, and C:P ratio. Qinghai, parts of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the coast zones have low TP and N : P ratio. Significant differences for SOC, TN, TP, C : N, C : P and N : P ratios were observed across groups categorized by predominant vegetation. Moisture, temperature and precipitation all closely related to SOC, TN, TP and their pairwise ratios. The hydrothermal coefficient (RH), defined as annual average precipitation divided by temperature, positively and significantly related to C : N, C : P and N : P ratios, implying that ongoing climate change may prejudice peatlands as carbon sinks during the past 50 years in China.

AB This paper investigates the relationship between vascular plant production and CH4 emissions from an arctic wet tundra ecosystem in north-east Greenland. Light intensity was manipulated by shading during three consecutive growing seasons (1998-2000). The shading treatment resulted in lower carbon cycling in the ecosystem as mean seasonal net ecosystem exchange (NEE) decreased from 336 to -196 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) and from -476 to -212 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in 1999 and 2000, respectively, and total ecosystem respiration decreased from 125 to 94 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in 1999 and from 409 to 306 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in 2000. Seasonal mean CH4 emissions in controls and shaded plots were, respectively, 6.5 and 4.5 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in 1999 and 8.3 and 6.2 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in 2000. We found that CH4 emission was sensitive to NEE and carbon turnover, and it is reasonable to assume that the correlation was due to a combined effect of vegetative CH4 transport and substrate quality coupled to vascular plant production. Total aboveground biomass was correlated to mean seasonal CH4 emission, but separation into species showed that plant-mediated CH4 transport was highly species dependent. Potential CH4 production peaked at the same depth as maximum root density (5-15 cm) and treatment differences further suggest that substrate quality was negatively affected by decreased NEE in the shaded plots. The concentration of dissolved CH4 decreased in the control plots as the growing season progressed while it was relatively stable in the shaded plots. This suggests that a progressively better developed root system in the controls increased the capacity to transport CH4 from the soil to the atmosphere. In conclusion, vascular plant photosynthetic rate and subsequent allocation of recently fixed carbon to belowground structures seemed to influence both vegetative CH4 transport and substrate quality.

AB In the Boreal Plain of Canada, the margins of peatland ecosystems that regulate solute and nutrient fluxes between peatlands and adjacent mineral uplands are prone to deep peat burning. Whether post-fire carbon accumulation is able to offset large carbon losses associated with the deep burning at peatland margins is unknown. For this reason, we examined how post-fire hydrological conditions (i.e. water table depth and periodicity, soil tension, and surface moisture content) and depth of burn were associated with moss recolonization at the peatland margins of three sites. We then interpreted these findings using a hydrogeological systems approach, given the importance of groundwater in determining conditions in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum in peatlands. Peatland margins dominated by local groundwater flow from adjacent peatland middles were characterized by dynamic hydrological conditions that, when coupled with lowered peatland margin surface elevations due to deep burning, produced two common hydrological states: 1) flooding during wet periods and 2) rapid water table declines during dry periods. These dynamic hydrological states were unfavorable to peatland moss recolonization and bryophytes typical of post-fire recovery in mineral uplands became established. In contrast, at a peatland margin where post-fire hydrological conditions were moderated by larger-scale groundwater flow, flooding and rapid water table declines were infrequent and, subsequently, greater peatland-dwelling moss recolonization was observed. We argue that peatland margins poorly connected to larger-scale groundwater flow are not only prone to deep burning but also lags in post-fire moss recovery. Consequently, an associated reduction in post-fire peat accumulation may occur and negatively affect the net carbon sink status and ecohydrological and biogeochemical function of these peatlands.

AB Globally, peatlands account for circa 50% of terrestrial carbon storage containing as much carbon as is present in the atmosphere. The uplands of the UK have an extensive cover of blanket peat but much of it is actively eroding. This paper presents a detailed organic sediment budget for a blanket peat catchment in the north Pennines and comparative data from a catchment in the southern Pennines. The catchments have total sediment yields (organic and mineral) of 44 and 267t km(-2) a(-1) and organic sediment yields 31 and 195t km(-2) a(-1), respectively. They represent two extremes of a spectrum of eroded peat catchments. It is demonstrated that the lower sediment yields in the north Pennines are associated with extensive natural revegetation of the catchment and consequent reductions in slope-channel linkage. Construction of a carbon budget for the north Pennine catchment demonstrates that particulate carbon losses associated with the fluvial suspended sediment load are the largest single carbon loss from the system. The system is currently close to carbon neutral but much higher carbon losses associated with actively eroding systems such as the south Pennine site would make these systems a major carbon source. The possibility that enhanced summer temperatures and winter storminess will accelerate erosion of upland mires means there is a risk that physical degradation of peatlands could become a significant positive feedback on global warming. Mitigation of these potential global effects will depend on local management informed by a clear understanding of peatland sediment dynamics. The sediment budget data here suggest that in gullied peatlands revegetation of gully floors is an effective control on sediment flux so that techniques such as gully blocking are likely to be effective approaches to erosion control.

AB Wetlands are major sources of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases released during microbial degradation. Despite the fact that decomposition is mainly driven by bacteria and fungi, little is known about the taxonomic diversity of bacterial communities in wetlands, particularly Sphagnum bogs. To explore bacterial community composition, 24 bogs in Vermont and Massachusetts were censused for bacterial diversity at the surface (oxic) and I in (anoxic) regions. Bacterial diversity was characterized by a terminal restriction fragment length (T-RFLP) fingerprinting technique and a cloning strategy that targeted the 16S rRNA gene. T-RFLP analysis revealed a high level of diversity, and a canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated marked similarity among bogs, but consistent differences between surface and subsurface assemblages. 16S rDNA sequences derived from one of the sites showed high numbers of clones belonging to the Deltaproteobacteria group. Several other phyla were represented, as well as two Candidate Division-level taxonomic groups. These data suggest that bog microbial communities are complex, possibly stratified, and similar among multiple sites.

AB Peatlands are important players in climate change-biosphere feedbacks via long-term net carbon (C) accumulation in soil organic matter and as potential net C sources including the potent greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Interactions of climate, site-hydrology, plant community, and groundwater chemical factors influence peatland development and functioning, including C dioxide (CO2) and CH4 fluxes, but the role of microbial community composition is not well understood. To assess microbial functional and taxonomic dissimilarities, we used high throughput sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) to determine bacterial and archaeal community composition in soils from twenty North American peatlands. Targeted DNA metabarcoding showed that although Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the dominant phyla on average, intermediate and rich fens hosted greater diversity and taxonomic richness, as well as an array of candidate phyla when compared with acidic and nutrient-poor poor fens and bogs. Moreover, pH was revealed to be the strongest predictor of microbial community structure across sites. Predictive metagenome content (PICRUSt) showed increases in specific genes, such as purine/pyrimidine and amino-acid metabolism in mid-latitude peatlands from 38 to 45 degrees N, suggesting a shift toward utilization of microbial biomass over utilization of initial plant biomass in these microbial communities. Overall, there appears to be noticeable differences in community structure between peatland classes, as well as differences in microbial metabolic activity between latitudes. These findings are in line with a predicted increase in the decomposition and accelerated C turnover, and suggest that peatlands north of 37 degrees latitude may be particularly vulnerable to climate change.

AB Wetlands in mid-high latitude regions play a vital role in climate change, due to their high organic carbon density. Nonetheless, the stabilization of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its fractions in these regions is largely unknown. The objectives of this study were to examine the changes in SOC and its fractions along a latitudinal gradient and to analyze the influencing factors in the southern margin of the permafrost region on the Eurasian continent. Topsoil (0-20 cm) was collected from five wetlands along a latitudinal gradient in Northeast China. We analyzed SOC and some labile fractions. Our results demonstrated that wetland SOC and its labile fractions concentration declined with decreasing latitude. The Permafrost regions had greater organic carbon content than the regions with seasonally frozen ground. The light fraction organic carbon and particulate organic carbon accounted for 5-83% and 21-32%, respectively, of the SOC and were particularly enriched in the permafrost region. Microbial biomass carbon and dissolved organic carbon showed a similar decreasing trend to that of SOC. At the same latitude, vegetation affected SOC stock and the dynamics of its labile fractions. Therefore, wetlands in mid-high latitudes contain a large carbon pool, and carbon stock varies with latitude. Although the labile fractions were higher in the permafrost region, their activities were lower, due to low temperature and poor nutrient status. Under global warming, the labile carbon pool may be mobilized and contribute to the greenhouse effect. Moreover, vegetation differences should be considered in obtaining an accurate carbon calculation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High demand for horticultural peat has increased peatland drainage and peat extraction in Canada. The hydrology and carbon cycling of these cutover peatlands is greatly altered, necessitating active restoration efforts to permit the regeneration of Sphagnum mosses and the re-establishment of natural peatland function. The effect of peatland extraction and restoration on the export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was examined for three successive seasons (May to October, 1999 to 2001) at two different sites (cutover and restored) in eastern Quebec. A shift towards higher DOC concentrations was observed following peatland extraction (maximum: 182.6 mg L(-1)) and concentrations remained high post-restoration (maximum: 191.0 mg L(-1)). The cutover site exported more DOC than the restored site in all three study seasons. The highest exports occurred during the wettest year (1999), with cutover and restored site export of 10.3 and 4.8 g m(-2), respectively. In 2000, 8.5 g C m(-2) was released from the cutover site, while the restored site released less than half that amount (3.4 g C m(-2)). In 2001, the restored site released about the same amount of DOC as in the previous year (3.5 g C m(-2)), while the cutover site load dropped to 6.2 g C m(-2). Both sites were net exporters of DOC in all years. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

   implications for the permafrost carbon feedback

AB Mobilization of soil/sediment organic carbon into inland waters constitutes a substantial, but poorly-constrained, component of the global carbon cycle. Radiocarbon (C-14) analysis has proven a valuable tool in tracing the sources and fate of mobilized carbon, but aquatic C-14 studies in permafrost regions rarely detect 'old' carbon (assimilated from the atmosphere into plants and soil prior to AD1950). The emission of greenhouse gases derived from old carbon by aquatic systems may indicate that carbon sequestered prior to AD1950 is being destabilized, thus contributing to the 'permafrost carbon feedback' (PCF). Here, we measure directly the C-14 content of aquatic CO2, alongside dissolved organic carbon, in headwater systems of the western Canadian Arctic-the first such concurrent measurements in the Arctic. Age distribution analysis indicates that the age of mobilized aquatic carbon increased significantly during the 2014 snow-free season as the active layer deepened. This increase in age was more pronounced in DOC, rising from 101-228 years before sampling date (a 120%-125% increase) compared to CO2, which rose from 92-151 years before sampling date (a 59%-63% increase). 'Pre-industrial' aged carbon (assimilated prior to similar to AD1750) comprised 15%-40% of the total aquatic carbon fluxes, demonstrating the prevalence of old carbon to Arctic headwaters. Although the presence of this old carbon is not necessarily indicative of a net positive PCF, we provide an approach and baseline data which can be used for future assessment of the PCF.

AB High-latitude peatlands are important soil carbon sinks. In these ecosystems, the mineralization of carbon and nitrogen are constrained by low temperatures and low nutrient concentrations in plant litter and soil organic matter. Global warming is predicted to increase soil N availability for plants at high-latitude sites. We applied N fertilizer as an experimental analogue for this increase. In a three-year field experiment we studied N fertilization effects on leaf litter decomposition and N dynamics of the four dominant plant species (comprising > 75% of total aboveground biomass) in a sub-arctic bog in northern Sweden. The species were Empetrum nigrum (evergreen shrub), Eriophorum vaginatum (graminoid), Betula nana (deciduous shrub) and Rubus chamaemorus (perennial forb). In the controls, litter mass loss rates increased in the order: Empetrum < Eriophorum < Betula < Rubus. Increased N availability had variable, species-specific effects: litter mass loss rates (expressed per unit litter mass) increased in Empetrum, did not change in Eriophorum and Betula and decreased in Rubus. In the leaf litter from the controls, we measured no or only slight net N mineralization even after three years. In the N-fertilized treatments we found strong net N immobilization, especially in Eriophorum and Betula. This suggests that, probably owing to substantial chemical and/or microbial immobilization, additional N supply does not increase the rate of N cycling for at least the first three years.

AB Dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria are ubiquitous in soils worldwide, possess the ability to transfer electrons outside of their cell membranes, and are capable of respiring with various metal oxides. Reduction of iron oxides is one of the more energetically favorable forms of anaerobic respiration, with a higher energy yield than both sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. As such, this process has significant implications for soil carbon balances, especially in the saturated, carbon-rich soils of the northern latitudes. However, the dynamics of these microbial processes within the context of the greater soil microbiome remain largely unstudied. Previously, we have demonstrated the capability of potentiostatically poised electrodes to mimic the redox potential of iron(III)- and humic acid-compounds and obtain a measure of metal-reducing respiration. Here, we extend this work by utilizing poised electrodes to provide an inexaustable electron acceptor for iron- and humic acid-reducing microbes, and by measuring the effects on both microbial community structure and greenhouse gas emissions. The application of both nonpoised and poised graphite electrodes in peat soils stimulated methane emissions by 15%-43% compared to soils without electrodes. Poised electrodes resulted in higher (13%-24%) methane emissions than the nonpoised electrodes. The stimulation of methane emissions for both nonpoised and poised electrodes correlated with the enrichment of proteobacteria, verrucomicrobia, and bacteroidetes. Here, we demonstrate a tool for precisely manipulating localized redox conditions in situ (via poised electrodes) and for connecting microbial community dynamics with larger ecosystem processes. This work provides a foundation for further studies examining the role of dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria in global biogeochemical cycles.

AB Changes in vegetation composition due to nitrogen deposition may influence the role of peatlands in the carbon cycle. The impact of nitrogen (N) on vegetation composition of the Mer Bleue Bog (Ontario) and the underlying mechanisms were studied using a coupled carbon (C) and nitrogen wetland model (PEATBOG). The model was applied to data from a long-term nutrient fertilization experiment and the results were compared with the observed C and N pools in plants, peat, and soil water after 8 years of fertilization with 1.6, 3.2, and 6.4 gN m(-2) y(-1) and additional phosphorus and potassium. The evaluated model was employed to simulate the vegetation dynamics in the peatland fertilized with different loads and concentrations of N. The model suggested a shift in plant functional types from moss-shrub dominated to graminoid dominated with increasing N load. Suppression of mosses by N fertilization was mitigated by daily deposition of N at a low concentration. Mosses became extinct in the simulations only when the concentration and load of N deposition were high, corroborating empirical results from the fertilization experiment. Tracking the deposited N in the system, the model indicated that it was primarily sequestered in the peat. Dissolved N concentrations in peat and export from the bog increased with N load and decreased with N concentration, leading to higher N uptake by vascular plants. The results further suggested that the observed detrimental effect of N on mosses was most likely due to toxicity caused by N uptake exceeding N assimilation. Exposure of mosses to high N concentrations in precipitation and evaporating water on moss tissues is thus a factor that needs attention when considering critical loads of N deposition on peatlands.

AB The highly visible coastal phenomenon of wetland loss in coastal Louisiana (LA) was examined through the prism of carbon accumulation and loss. Carbon storage or sequestration in rapidly subsiding LA coastal marsh soils was based on vertical marsh accretion and aerial change data. Marshes sequester significant amount of carbon through vertical accretion however, large amounts of carbon previously sequestration in the soil profile is lost through annual deterioration of these coastal marshes. Hurricanes, such as Katrina and Rita, have triggered instantaneous large carbon losses of sequestered soil carbon through the destruction of large areas of marsh. This analysis shows proposed coastal restoration efforts will not be sufficient to restore carbon losses by storms and marsh deterioration. Further, we have estimated the economic benefit of carbon sequestration for coastal wetland restoration efforts. Results show that LA coastal marshes may not serve as a net sink of carbon. These results may serve as a predictor of the impact of future predictions of increasing global sea level rise on carbon sequestration for other coastal regions.

AB Sphagnum-bog ecosystems have a limited capability to retain carbon and nutrients when subjected to increased nitrogen (N) deposition. Although it has been proposed that phosphorus (P) can dilute negative effects of nitrogen by increasing biomass production of Sphagnum mosses, it is still unclear whether P-addition can alleviate physiological N-stress in Sphagnum plants. A 3-year fertilisation experiment was conducted in lawns of a pristine Sphagnum magellanicum bog in Patagonia, where competing vascular plants were practically absent. Background wet deposition of nitrogen was low (similar to 0.10.2 g.N.m-2.year-1). Nitrogen (4 g.N.m-2.year-1) and phosphorus (1 g.P.m-2.year-1) were applied, separately and in combination, six times during the growing season. P-addition substantially increased biomass production of Sphagnum. Nitrogen and phosphorus changed the morphology of Sphagnum mosses by enhancing height increment, but lowering moss stem density. In contrast to expectations, phosphorus failed to alleviate physiological stress imposed by excess nitrogen (e.g. amino acid accumulation, N-saturation and decline in photosynthetic rates). We conclude that despite improving growth conditions by P-addition, Sphagnum-bog ecosystems remain highly susceptible to nitrogen additions. Increased susceptibility to desiccation by nutrients may even worsen the negative effects of excess nitrogen especially in windy climates like in Patagonia.

AB Three independent methods were used to measure net ecosystem production (NEP) in four wetlands near Thompson, Manitoba, Canada. The first method calculated NEP by subtracting heterotrophic respiration from net primary productivity, using both measurements and estimates derived from the literature. The second method used radiocarbon data from cores to derive long-term NEP averaged over the past several decades. The third method used direct measurement of NEP combined with a model to fill in for days with no data. The three methods, with their independently derived uncertainties, ail show the same magnitude and pattern of NEP variation across four different wetland types. However direct measurement yielded distinctly lower estimates of NEP in the most productive sites. Highest NEP (31 - 180 gC m(-2) yr(-1)) was observed in the two wetlands with the highest proportion of sedge vegetation. A bog collapse scar and a nutrient-rich fen had NEP values not significantly different from zero. The maximum NEP at sites with intermediate nutrient status is due to slower overall decomposition and is likely associated with greater allocation of production below ground by sedges. The three methods for estimating NEP differ in the effort required, the sources of error, and in the timescale over which they apply. Used in combination, they allow estimation of parameters such as belowground production and the contribution of heterotrophic decomposition to total soil respiration. Using the radiocarbon method, we also derived estimates of the rate of N accumulation in the four wetland types.

AB Net primary production in wetlands of continental western Canada (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba) is mapped of wetlands, with peatlands representing and summarized by wetland type and ecoregion. The region contains 405 300 km(2) 90.1% of all wetlands. Based on a regional synthesis of published values, of net primary production, shrubby swamp and marsh wetlands produce more biomass annually through the process of net primary production than peatlands. Different peatland types appear to sequester similar amounts of plant biomass on an annual basis, with the exception of permafrost bogs that sequester less. Wetland net primary production for the region is calculated as 2.1 x 10(14) g yr(-1) of plant biomass, with 73.5% sequestered in peatlands. This is equivalent to 9.95 x 10(13) g yr-1 of carbon. Provincially this carbon is partitioned into 50%, for Manitoba, 30% for Alberta, and 20% for Saskatchewan. ON or the last 1000 years, an average of only 5% of this biomass (and carbon) accumulate as peat, with most lost through the process of decomposition. When the annual amount of carbon that accumulates a, peat is compared to the amount emitted provincially as anthropogenic greenhouse gases, wetlands present in each of the provinces accumulate 4% (Alberta), 8% (Saskatchewan), and 62% (Manitoba) of the emitted carbon annually. Wetlands in continental western Canada are a significant, active biosphere carbon sink following accumulation patterns of the last one thousand years. Future changes, particularly in fire frequency or intensity. may alter this accumulation pattern.

AB Peat moss-based potting mix was amended with either of two composted swine wastes, CSW1 and CSW2. at rates from 4 to 20% (vol/vol) to evaluate suppression of pre-emergence damping-off of impatiens (Impatiens balsamina) caused by Rhizoctonia solani (anastomosis group-4). A cucumber bioassay was used prior to each impatiens experiment to monitor maturity of compost as the compost aged in a curing pile by evaluating, disease suppression toward both Pythium ultimum and R. solani. At 16,24,32, and 37 weeks after composting, plug trays filled with compost-amended potting mix were seeded with impatiens and infested with R. solani to determine suppression of damping-off. Pre-emergence damping-off was lower for impatiens gown in potting mix amended with 20% CSW1 than in CSW2-amended and nonamended mixes. To identify relationships between disease suppression and microbial parameters, samples of mixes were collected to determine microbial activity, biomass carbon and nitrogen, functional diversity, and population density. Higher rates of microbial activity were observed with increasing rates of CSW1 amendment than with CSW2 amendments. Microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen also were higher in CSW1-amended mixes than in CSW2-amended potting mixes 1 day prior to seeding and 5 weeks after seeding. Principal component analysis of Biolog-GN2 profiles showed different functional diversities between CSW1- and CSW2-amended mixes. Furthermore, mixes amended with CSW1 had higher colony forming units of fungi, endospore-forming bacteria, and oligotrophic bacteria. Our results suggest that enhanced microbial activity, functional and population diversity of stable compost-amended mix were associated with suppressiveness to Rhizoctonia damping-off in impatiens.

AB Identifying the processes controlling the carbon balance in northern peatlands is crucial for their integration in global climate models. As a first step, current models of peatlands dynamics need to be adequately evaluated to verify the consistency of processes before their integration in global models.
   We compared here the sensitivity of the total carbon mass of a peatland simulated by the Holocene Peat Model (HPM) derived from different sensitivity methods: a 'classic' local sensitivity analysis method and a global approach with the screening method.
   We observed that the conclusions drawn by the different methods are very different and, moreover, that it is not advisable to draw any general conclusion from a local one-at-a-time (OAT) experiment because the model space represented is very limited. The results also stressed that the representation of several processes, such as runoff or peat decomposition under different saturation conditions, lack sufficient empirical data and knowledge to be adequately represented in the model. In addition to the evaluation of the model per se, the exploration of its behaviour allowed us to observe simulations of two fen-bog transition patterns.
   This study showed that interactions between parameters should be taken into account when evaluating peatland dynamics models. The results of the screening method are useful for model improvement and simplification. Moreover, this method enables the exploration of model processes in detail, thus providing insight into peatland system dynamics. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands export significant amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to freshwaters, but the quantity of DOC reaching marine environments is typically less than the input to the fluvial system due to processing within the water column. Key removal processes include photo-chemical degradation, and heterotrophic bacterial respiration. In this study we examined these processes using C-14-labelled DOC to quantify the extent of DOC breakdown and to determine its fate following irradiation under controlled laboratory conditions. We examined the influence of microbial processes occurring within the water column, the potential role of stream-bed biofilms, and the possible modifying effects of downstream mixing, as DOC in water from the peatland encounters runoff from upland mineral soils ("Mountain"), nutrient-rich runoff from agricultural soils, and seawater in an estuary. Our results demonstrated conservative mixing of DOC from Peatland and Mountain waters but interactive effects when Peatland water was mixed with Agricultural and Estuary waters and exposed to solar radiation. The mixing of Peatland and Agricultural waters led to net DOC production, suggesting that DOC was only partially degraded by solar radiation and that the products of this might have fuelled autotrophic microbial growth in the samples. The mixing of Peatland water with saline estuary water resulted in net DOC loss following irradiation, suggesting a role for sunlight in enhancing the flocculation of DOC to particulate organic carbon (POC) in saline environments.

AB Multiple analyses of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from pore waters were conducted to define the processes that govern carbon balance in peatlands: (1) source, reactivity, and transport of DOC with respect to vegetation, peat, and age of carbon substrate, (2) reactivity of DOC with respect to molecular size, and (3) lability to photoxidation of surficial DOC. We found that surface organic production fuels heterotrophic respiration at depth in advection-dominated peatlands, especially in fens. Fen DOC was C-14 enriched relative to the surrounding fen peat, and fen respiration products were similar to this enriched DOC indicating that DOC was the main microbial substrate. Bog DOC was more variable showing either enrichment in C-14 at depth or C-14 values that follow peat values. This variability in bogs is probably controlled by the relative importance of vertical transport of labile carbon substrates within the peat profile versus DOC production from bog peat. These results extended our set of observations to 10 years at one bog-fen pair and add two additional bog-fen pairs to our series of observations. Anaerobic incubations of peat, rinsed free of residual DOC, produced DOC and respiration products that were strikingly similar to the peat values in a bog and two fens. This result demonstrated conclusively that downward advection is the process responsible for the presence of modern DOC found at depth in the peat column. Fen DOC has lower C/N values and up to twice as much LMW (<1 kDa) DOC as bogs due to differences in organic inputs and greater microbial processing. Fluorescence irradiation experiments showed that fen DOC is more photolabile than bog DOC.

AB The interpretation of isotopic variation in Sphagnum from Holocene peat profiles rests upon several assumptions concerning physiological processes such as Variation in CO2 uptake and differences in the isotopic ratio of the source CO2. To examine such variability Sphagnum from hummock-hollow complexes from two raised bogs (Florencecourt and Clara) in Ireland was sampled for carbon isotope analysis. Samples were taken from relatively dry hummock tops, margins and submerged hollows. Carbon isotope measurements on cellulose obtained from the Sphagnum revealed a variation of similar to 6 parts per thousand across the bog surface. The mean values for Florencecourt and Clara Bog are -25.6 parts per thousand and -26.5 parts per thousand (PDB) respectively, which is consistent with the sphagna utilizing C-3 photosynthesis to take up atmospheric CO2. The hummock-top species from both sites yielded lighter isotopic values than the hummock-margin species which is consistent with the hummock-top species photosynthesizing under a lower water content and hence lower external diffusion resistance. A large range of partial derivative(13)C values was recorded for the hollow samples. The heaviest isotopic values result from high external resistance to CO2. in some situations, however, the carbon source contains a proportion of recycled CO2, depleted in C-13, which produces relatively light isotopic values. Such large isotopic variation within the wet hollows may lead to erroneous climatic interpretation.

AB The Boreal Shield and James Bay Lowland regions of Ontario have few Holocene reconstructions specific to surface moisture despite their potential importance to documenting the geographic patterns and teleconnections of Holocene pluvials and droughts, as well as their role in the global carbon cycle. We reconstructed water table depth using preserved testate amoebae in four stratigraphic peatland cores, supplemented with a literature review to investigate the effects of the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) and Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) on surface moisture and long-term apparent carbon accumulation (LARCA) in the regions. A 7320 calendar years before AD 1950 (yrBP) length record registered a wet shift at 4600 yrBP in concert with the HTM and a later post-2550 yrBP shift towards wetter and more stable conditions, possibly related to the Roman Warm Period. During the late-Holocene the three most southern boreal records indicated a lack of droughts during the MCA. Medieval pluvials in boreal Ontario would be consistent with North American precipitation patterns under La Nifia conditions. Of the three wet-warm periods identified (HTM, 2550 yrBP, MCA), the 2550 yrBP shift had the most consistent positive influence on LARCA regionally. Although past precipitation was positively correlated with temperature in the region, recent drying may be indicative of a fundamental change in evaporation-precipitation balance.

AB Increases in the supply of atmospheric CO2 and N are expected to alter the carbon cycle, including CH4 emissions, in boreal peatlands. These effects were studied in a glasshouse experiment with peat monoliths cored from an oligotrophic pine fen. The cores with living plants were kept in 720 ppm(v) and 360 ppm(v) CO2 atmospheres for about 6 months under imitated natural temperature cycle. Fertilisation with NH4NO3 (3 g m(-2) for 25 weeks) was applied to 18 of the 36 monoliths. The rate of CH4 flux was non-linearly dependent on the number of Eriophorum vaginatum shoots growing in the monoliths, probably due to the gas transport properties of the aerenchyma. The average CH4 efflux rate, standardised by the number of shoots, was increased by a maximum of 10-20% in response to the raised CO2 level. In the raised-NH4NO3 treatment, the increase in CH4 release was lower. The effect of combined CO2 + NH4NO3 on CH4 release was negligible and even lower than in the single treatments. Both potential CH4 production and oxidation rates at 5, 15 and 25 degrees C were higher near the surface than at the bottom of the core. As expected, the rates clearly depended on the incubation temperature, but the different treatments did not cause any consistent differences in either CH4 production or oxidation. The determination of potential CH4 production and oxidation in the laboratory is evidently too crude a method of differentiating substrate-induced differences in CH4 production and oxidation in vivo. These results indicate that an increase in atmospheric CO2 or N supply alone, at least in the short term, slightly enhances CH4 effluxes from boreal peatlands; but together their effect may even be restrictive.

AB Palsa mires are northern mire complexes with permanently frozen peat hummocks, located at the outer limit of the permafrost zone. Palsa mires have high conservation Status, being characterized by a rich diversity of bird species and unique geomorphological processes. They are currently degrading throughout their distributional range, probably because of regional climatic warming. Distributions of palsas in Fermoscandia were modelled using 5 climate envelope techniques (generalized linear modelling, generalized additive modelling, classification tree analysis, artificial neural networks and multiple adaptive regression splines). The models were studied with respect to their sensitivity to altered climate. Climate change scenarios were applied to assess possible impacts on the palsa distribution during the 21st century. The models achieved a good to very good agreement with the observed palsa distribution and thus suggest a strong dependency on climate. Even small increases of temperature (1 degrees C) and precipitation (10%) resulted in considerable losses of areas suitable for palsa development. Of the 5 models tested, 3 predicted the total disappearance of regions suitable for palsa development with an increased mean annual temperature of VC. Under climate change scenarios based on 7 Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) the models indicated that the degradation of palsas will proceed very quickly. All but one climate scenario resulted in the total disappearance of suitable regions for palsa development by the end of the 21st century. Potential impacts of degrading palsa mires on biodiversity and carbon balance are the loss of habitat for migrating bird species and the increase in CH4 emissions.

AB Permafrost degradation can result in the loss of significant amounts of carbon, through release to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide and/or methane and through export downstream to lakes and rivers. The fate of this carbon in lake ecosystems is poorly understood. We investigated the capacity of lake bacteria to utilize carbon from different soils from an adjacent mire. Dark bioassays were undertaken to measure the dynamics of the bioavailability and chemical character of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The soils ranged from already degraded minerotrophic fens to ombrotrophic active layer and soils from the permafrost layer. Our study shows that soil DOC was rapidly consumed by bacteria collected from lake water, particularly within the first 48 h (about 85% of the total consumed DOC). The mean DOC consumption by lake bacteria was 0.087 mg L-1 d(-1) when supplied with lake water DOC and varied between 0.382 mg L-1 d(-1) (permafrost soil) and 0.491 mg L-1 d(-1) (degraded fen soil) when supplied with terrestrial DOC. Thus, the data suggest that export of DOC from degrading permafrost mires at any stage of degradation can potentially increase rates of respiration by fourfold to sevenfold and can have pronounced effects both on receiving lake ecosystems and on the land-atmosphere carbon balance. In this study we also propose simple predictive models, incorporating weight-averaged molecular weight and specific UV absorption in combination with other simple qualitative parameters for the estimation of potential bioavailability of soil DOC in aquatic ecosystems.

AB Science-based information on historical fire frequency is lacking for longleaf pine sandhills. We undertook a high-resolution macroscopic charcoal and geochemical analysis of sediment cores recovered from three depression marshes located within a longleaf pine sandhill ecosystem in Florida, USA. A similar to 1500-year fire history reconstructed from >1.5 m length peat cores analyzed at decadal to multi-decadal resolution revealed abundant macroscopic charcoal particles at nearly all sampling intervals, suggesting that fire occurred near the sites for almost all decades represented in the deposit. This result supported previous hypotheses of a frequent natural fire return interval for Florida's longleaf pine sandhills and suggested that management decisions for this ecosystem should continue to focus on the frequent prescription of controlled burns. Our research also demonstrated that some of Florida's depression marshes contain a >3000-year archive of organic-rich peat. Bulk elemental carbon and nitrogen data and stable carbon isotope analysis of the deposits at two of the three study sites suggested persistently wet soils. Soil data from the third site suggested that drying and peat oxidation occurred periodically. These depression marshes rapidly sink carbon, with measured sequestration rates on the order of 16 to 56 g m(-2) yr(-1). Our research demonstrated that Florida's depression marshes provide an untapped record of paleoenvironmental information.

AB Raised bog pools are extremely nutrient poor and rich in humic substances, and these features limit primary production. To assess the base of the invertebrate food web in bog pools we measured the stable-isotopic signatures of primary producers, dead organic matter, and invertebrates, and the composition and stable-C-isotope ratio of their phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFAs). The stable-isotopic signatures showed the presence of multiple trophic levels and differential use of basal food sources by the invertebrates among and within species, individuals, and size classes. Carnivorous and omnivorous invertebrates assimilated polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) derived from algae, and possibly macrophytes, and fatty acids that are specific for methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB). Part of the bacterial biomass conveyed to higher trophic levels in the bog pools originated from MOB. Pelagic zooplankton appeared to rely more on bacteria, whereas insects relied more on algae. Periphyton, a primary algal food source, was the basal food source most depleted in C-13 and was inferred to sustain >= 1/2 the invertebrate food web. The relatively depleted delta C-13 values of PUFAs in invertebrates suggest a role for methane-derived C. We argue that the CO2 assimilated by the algae could be derived from MOB. Therefore, depleted delta C-13 values of invertebrates do not necessarily indicate a direct pathway between MOB and these invertebrates because algae may form an intermediate level.

AB The long-term effects of high nitrogen supply on the growth and partitioning of biomass in a common sedge species, Carer rostrata Stokes, were studied in a greenhouse experiment Special attention was paid to free amino acids and soluble sugars, representing biochemically available fractions of nitrogen and carbon, respectively, in the tissues of Carer. Plants were grown in peat in buckets, and nitrogen was added as ammonium nitrate (2, 5, and 10 g N m(-2) year(-1)) five times during two growing seasons. Changes in biomass allocation patterns became evident towards the end of the second growing season. The biomass of shoots was highest in the high-N treatment, resulting in a high ratio of aboveground to belowground biomass. The high biomass of shoots was due to both the high density of current-year shoots and later senescence in the high-N treatment. No differences were observed in the belowground biomasses. Changes in allocation patterns were accompanied by changes in the soluble fractions of carbon and nitrogen. The concentration of free amino acids (FAA) was significantly higher (both shoots and roots) and the concentration of total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) lower (roots only) in the high-N treatment. The concentration of total nitrogen also increased with increasing supply of nitrogen. The results indicate that a high long-term supply of nitrogen may shift the internal carbon to nitrogen balance of Carer towards higher availability of nitrogen. Compared with the carbon to nitrogen ratio, the TNC:FAA ratio seems to be a better indicator of the internal carbon to nitrogen balance. A low TNC:FAA ratio may enhance the allocation of biomass to shoots and also increase the density of shoots.

AB The probable limits of the carbon budget of the Rapid River Watershed, within the greater Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatland in northern Minnesota, were evaluated using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. Carbon enters the peatlands in groundwater, precipitation, and primary productivity. Carbon leaves the peatlands by groundwater and surface water outflow and by the outgassing of methane. Results of the simulations of the carbon budget show that the peatland is now probably a sink for carbon, supported by field data showing pear is, in fact, accumulating at the rate of about 1 mm yr(-1) [Glaser er al., 1997]. Excluding extreme values, Monte Carlo simulation results indicate that the Rapid River Peatland stores between -28.98 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (release) and 50.38 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (storage) with a mean accumulation of 12.74 g C m(-2) yr(-1) over the 1,506,200 m(2) watershed. The peatland appears to be delicately poised with respect to net gain or loss of carbon.

AB Fengycin is a promising antifungal lipopeptide from Bacillus spp. synthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). In this work, fengycin production of a spontaneous fengycin overproducing strain, Bacillus subtilis BBG21, was first compared to those of B. subtilis BBG111 (a 168 derivative), B. subtilis ATCC 21332 and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 under two different experimental conditions. In both conditions, very high fengycin yields were obtained from strain BBG21 (480 mg/L) in comparison to its counterparts. The high efficiency of the fengycin promoter (P-fen) of BBG21 compared to the promoter of BBG111 and FZB42 was confirmed using a GFP reporter gene. Under all tested conditions, this promoter showed highest expression in comparison to the other strains. The highest fluorescence rate was obtained with mannitol as carbon source. In addition, when the P-pps promoter from B. subtilis BBG111 was replaced by promoter P-fen from BBG21, fengycin production increased about 10-fold, while no fengycin overproduction was observed when replacement was performed with P-fen from ATCC 21332. Comparative sequence analysis of these different promoters revealed one nucleotide modification in the UP element known for its importance in the regulation process. This point mutation is thus responsible for overproduction of fengycin in BBG21. (C) 2016 Institut Pasteur. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Peat bogs have the ability to produce strong chelate ligands (humic and fulvic acids) which enhance the weathering rates of iron-silicate minerals and greatly increase the solubility of the essential trace metal iron in river water. Fluvial networks link peat bogs with the ocean, and thus terrestrial-derived fulvic-iron complexes fuel the ocean's biological productivity and biological carbon pump, but understanding this role is constrained by inconsistent observations regarding the behaviour of riverine iron in the estuarine mixing zone, where precipitation reactions remove iron from the water column. We applied a characterization of the colloidal iron carriers in peatland-draining rivers in North Scotland, using field-flow fractionation (FFF), in combination with end-member mixing experiments of river water sampled near the river mouth and coastal seawater using a Fe-59 radiotracer method. According to our results, the investigated river contributed "truly dissolved" Fe concentrations of about 3300 nmol L-1 to the ocean which is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the dissolved iron contribution of the "average world" river (similar to 40 nmol L-1). Thus we conclude that peatland-draining rivers are important sources of dissolved iron to the ocean margins. We propose highly electrostatic and sterical stabilized iron-organic matter complexes in the size range of <2 kDa to be responsible for iron transport across the estuarine mixing zone.

AB To date there is still a lack of reliable data on greenhouse gas emissions from drained fens needed to determine the climatic relevance of land use and land use change on peatlands and to supply the National Inventory Report for the German Greenhouse Gas Inventory. In this study we present the results of monthly-based multiyear measurements of CO2, N2O and CH4 flux rates in two drained agriculturally used fen ecosystems in NW Germany (cropland and grassland) over a period of 4.5 y using transparent and opaque closed chambers. CO2 exchange was modelled at high resolution with temperature and photosynthetic active radiation. The measured and modelled values fit very well (R-2 >= 0.93). Annual GHG and Global Warming Potential (GWP) balances were determined. Net CO2 emissions at the cropland and grassland sites were similarly high, taking into account changes in management; net ecosystem C balance amounted to about 4.0 to 5.0 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1). Emissions of N2O and CH4 were low at both sites. The mean GWP balance for a time frame of 100 y (GWP100) amounted to about 17.0 to 19.0 Mg CO2-eq. ha(-1) y(-1). The unexpectedly low greenhouse gas emissions from the cropland site are attributed to the high water table and a change in crop management. The change from corn for silage to corn-cob mix lead transiently to rather small greenhouse gas emissions. The study confirms the need for multiyear measurements taking climatic and management variation into account.

AB Large wildfires exert strong disturbance on regional and global climate systems and ecosystems by perturbing radiative forcing as well as the carbon and water balance between the atmosphere and land surface, while shortand long-term variations in fire weather, terrestrial ecosystems, and human activity modulate fire intensity and reshape fire regimes. The complex climate-fire-ecosystem interactions were not fully integrated in previous climate model studies, and the resulting effects on the projections of future climate change are not well understood. Here we use the fully interactive REgion-Specific ecosystem feedback Fire model (RESFire) that was developed in the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to investigate these interactions and their impacts on climate systems and fire activity. We designed two sets of decadal simulations using CESM-RESFire for present-day (2001-2010) and future (2051-2060) scenarios, respectively, and conducted a series of sensitivity experiments to assess the effects of individual feedback pathways among climate, fire, and ecosystems. Our implementation of RESFire, which includes online land-atmosphere coupling of fire emissions and fire-induced land cover change (LCC), reproduces the observed aerosol optical depth (AOD) from space-based Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite products and ground-based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) data; it agrees well with carbon budget benchmarks from previous studies. We estimate the global averaged net radiative effect of both fire aerosols and fire-induced LCC at - 0.59 +/- 0.52 W m(-2), which is dominated by fire aerosol- cloud interactions (-0.82 +/- 0.19 W m(-2)), in the presentday scenario under climatological conditions of the 2000s. The fire-related net cooling effect increases by similar to 170 % to -1.60 +/- 0.27 W m(-2) in the 2050s under the conditions of the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) scenario. Such considerably enhanced radiative effect is attributed to the largely increased global burned area (+19 %) and fire carbon emissions (+100 %) from the 2000s to the 2050s driven by climate change. The net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon between the land and atmosphere components in the simulations increases by 33 % accordingly, implying that biomass burning is an increasing carbon source at short-term timescales in the future. High-latitude regions with prevalent peatlands would be more vulnerable to increased fire threats due to climate change, and the increase in fire aerosols could counter the projected decrease in anthropogenic aerosols due to air pollution control policies in many regions. We also evaluate two distinct feedback mechanisms that are associated with fire aerosols and fire-induced LCC, respectively. On a global scale, the first mechanism imposes positive feedbacks to fire activity through enhanced droughts with suppressed precipitation by fire aerosol-cloud interactions, while the second one manifests as negative feedbacks due to reduced fuel loads by fire consumption and postfire tree mortality and recovery processes. These two feed-back pathways with opposite effects compete at regional to global scales and increase the complexity of climate-fire-ecosystem interactions and their climatic impacts.

AB The Zoige alpine peatlands are one of the highest and largest alpine peatlands in the world and play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Drainage is the main disturbance at Zoige, and the drawdown of the water table level changes CH4 emissions. There is still much uncertainty relating to how CH4 emissions respond to multiple water table levels. Here, we simulated six gradients (-30 cm, -20 cm, -10 cm, 0 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm) of the water table level through a mesocosm manipulation experiment in the Zoige peatlands. The water table level had a significant effect on CH4 emissions. CH4 emissions did not change with water table levels from -30 cm to -10 cm, but significantly increased as the water table level increased above -10 cm. A significant log-linear relationship (R-2 = 0.44, p < 0.001) was found between CH4 emissions and a water table level range from -10 to 20 cm. This study characterized the responses of CH4 emissions to multiple water table levels and provide additional data for accurately evaluating CH4 emissions. The results of this study also have several conservation implications for alpine peatlands.

AB Production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from peatland soil is controlled by rates of organic matter decomposition; soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition is influenced by the quality of the SOM and the soil temperature. This study determined the effect of increasing temperature and SOM quality on rates of greenhouse-gas production in lab incubations from peat soils formed under different plant functional types found in temperate rich and poor fens of southern Ontario, Canada. Peat derived from different plant functional type (sedge, shrub, and non-vascular vegetation) between the fens was composed of different amounts of SOM, lignin, and cellulose. Rates of CO2 and CH4 production from the lab slurriesin creased with increasing temperature; however, the relative increases were specific to the vegetation type overlying the soils. Anaerobic to aerobic production ratios ranged from 7% (Chamaedaphne soils) to > 30% (Sphagnum soils). Ratios of potential anaerobic production (CO2 to CH4) generally decreasedwith increasing temperature. The interaction between temperature and SOM quality was demonstrated through the range of Q(10) values (1.09-2.38 for CO2; 2.98-21.40 for CH4). These measures were correlated to lignin and cellulose content and the lingo-cellulose index. Results of this study indicate the variability of greenhouse-gas fluxes from peatland soils is influenced by the SOM quality derived from the overlying vegetation. As the climate warms soil temperatures will increase rates of decomposition, and this study will improve models of temperate peatland carbon cycling and can inform land management planning by providing options for minimizing carbon loss.

AB Natural open-water pools are a common feature of northern peatlands and are known to be an important source of atmospheric methane (CH4). Pool environmental variables, particularly water chemistry, vegetation community and physical characteristics, have the potential to exert strong controls on carbon cycling in pools. A total of 66 peatland pools were studied across three regions of the UK (northern Scotland, south-west Scotland, and Northern Ireland). We found that within-region variability of pool water chemistry was low; however, for many pool variables measured there were significant differences between regions. PCA analysis showed that pools in SW Scotland were strongly associated with greater vegetative cover and shallower water depth which is likely to increase dissolved organic carbon (DOC) mineralisation rates, whereas pools in N Scotland were more open and deeper. Pool water DOC, particulate organic carbon and dissolved CH4 concentrations were significantly different between regions. Pools in Northern Ireland had the highest concentrations of DOC (mean=14.5 mg L-1) and CH4 (mean=20.6 mu g CL-1). Chloride and sulphate concentrations were significantly higher in the pools in N Scotland (mean values 26.3 and 2.40 mg L-1, respectively) than elsewhere, due to a stronger marine influence. The ratio of UV absorbance at 465 nmto absorbance at 665 nm for pools in Northern Ireland indicated that DOC was sourced from poorly humified peat, potentially increasing the bioavailability and mineralisation of organic carbon in pools compared to the pools elsewhere. This study, which specifically aims to address a lack of basic biogeochemical knowledge about pool water chemistry, clearly shows that peatland pools are highly regionally variable. This is likely to be a reflection of significant regional-scale differences in peatland C cycling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Northern peatlands play an important role globally in the cycling of C, through the exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere, the emission of CH4, the production and export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the storage of C. Under 2 x CO2 GCM scenarios, most Canadian peatlands will be exposed to increases in mean annual temperature ranging between 2 and 6 degrees C and increases in mean annual precipitation of 0 to 15 %, with the most pronounced changes occurring during the winter. The increase in CO2 uptake by plants, through warmer temperatures and elevated atmospheric CO2, is likely to be offset by increased soil respiration rates in response to warmer soils and lowered water tables. CH4 emissions are likely to decrease in most peatlands because of lowered water tables, except where the peat surface adjusts to fluctuating water tables, and in permafrost, where the collapse of dry plateau and palsa will lead to increased CH4 emission. There likely will be little change in DOC production, but DOC export to water bodies will decrease as runoff decreases. The storage of C in peatlands is sensitive to all C cycle components and is difficult to predict. The challenge is to develop quantitative models capable of making these predictions for different peatlands. We present some qualitative responses, with levels of uncertainty. There will be, however, as much variation in response to climatic change within a peatland as there will be among peatland regions.

AB Soil moisture plays a vital role in regulating the direction and magnitude of methane (CH4) fluxes. However, it remains unclear whether the responses of CH4 fluxes to climate warming exhibit difference between dry and moist ecosystems. Based on standardized manipulative experiments (i.e., consistent experimental design and measurement protocols), here we explored warming effects on growing season CH4 fluxes in two alpine grasslands with contrasting water status on the Tibetan Plateau. We observed that experimental warming enhanced CH4 uptake in the relatively arid alpine steppe, but had no significant effects on CH4 emission in the moist swamp meadow. The distinct responses of CH4 fluxes were associated with the different warming effects on biotic and abiotic factors related to CH4 oxidation and production processes. Warming decreased soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) and increased the pmoA gene abundance and CH4 oxidation potential in the alpine steppe, which together led to a significant increase in CH4 uptake at this alpine steppe site. However, warming-induced enhancement in CH4 oxidation potential might be counteracted by the simultaneously increased CH4 production potential in the swamp meadow, which could then result in insignificant warming effects on CH4 emission at this swamp meadow site. Based on a meta-analysis of warming effects on CH4 fluxes across the entire Tibetan Plateau, we found that the entire alpine grasslands could absorb an extra 0.042 Tg CH4 (1 Tg = 10(12) g) per growing season if soil temperature increased by 1 degrees C. These findings demonstrate that warming effects on CH4 fluxes differ between two alpine grasslands with contrasting moisture conditions and the entire alpine grasslands may not trigger a positive CH4 feedback to climate system with moderate warming.

AB Deciphering the driving mechanisms of Earth system processes, including the climate dynamics expressed as paleoceanographic events, requires a complete, continuous, and high-resolution stratigraphy that is very accurately dated. In this study, a robust astronomically calibrated age model was constructed for the middle Eocene to early Oligocene interval (31-43Ma) in order to permit more detailed study of the exceptional climatic events that occurred during this time, including the middle Eocene climate optimum and the Eocene-Oligocene transition. A goal of this effort is to accurately date the middle Eocene to early Oligocene composite section cored during the Pacific Equatorial Age Transect (PEAT, IODP Exp. 320/321). The stratigraphic framework for the new timescale is based on the identification of the stable long eccentricity cycle in published and new high-resolution records encompassing bulk and benthic stable isotope, calibrated XRF core scanning, and magnetostrati-graphic data from ODP Sites 171B-1052, 189-1172, 1991218, and 207-1260 as well as IODP Sites 320-U1333, and 320-U1334 spanning magnetic polarity Chrons C12n to C20n. Subsequently orbital tuning of the records to the La2011 orbital solution was conducted. The resulting new timescale revises and refines the existing orbitally tuned age model and the geomagnetic polarity timescale from 31 to 43 Ma. The newly defined absolute age for the EoceneOligocene boundary validates the astronomical tuned age of 33.89Ma identified at the Massignano, Italy, global stratotype section and point. The compilation of geochemical records of climate-controlled variability in sedimenta-tion through the middle-to-late Eocene and early Oligocene demonstrates strong power in the eccentricity band that is readily tuned to the latest astronomical solution. Obliquity driven cyclicity is only apparent during 2.4 myr eccentricity cycle minima around 35.5, 38.3, and 40.1 Ma.

AB Results from an innovative approach to improve remediation in the rhizosphere by encouraging healthy plant growth and thus enhancing microbial activity are reported. Mixed grass-legume systems, together with microbial inoculants, were used to remediate a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (chrysene) spiked agricultural soil. Inoculants were symbiotic rhizobia, which may play an important role in rhizoremediation by increasing plant and root growth. An inoculum of an isolate of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii, selected for PAH tolerance, was produced using a peat carrier. The inoculum and white clover (Trifolium repens L.), were planted into soils with ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The soils spiked with chrysene (500 mg kg(-1)) then aged for 4 weeks. Shoot- and root-biomass of plants, and the amount of root nodulation, were determined. Rhizobial populations, soil pH and soil nitrogen were also monitored throughout the trial. In addition, the ability of the inoculated rhizobial strain to utilise chrysene as a sole carbon source was assessed. Direct uptake and/or degradation of chrysene by the clover and ryegrass did not occur to a significant degree. Enhanced losses of chrysene were seen in planted, non-sterile soils that contained a rhizobial inoculum. No direct degradation of chrysene by R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii was observed and no enhanced losses of PAHs were detected in sterile soils after inoculation with rhizobia. Results suggest that the enhanced dissipation of chrysene, observed in the non-sterile planted inoculated pots, was not a result of degradation of chrysene by R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii. The symbiotic association with R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii improved plant vigour and growth in inoculated planted treatments. This may have stimulated the rhizospheric microflora to degrade chrysene. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE oil palm biomass; growth models; carbon stock; plantation components
AB Reliable estimates of the carbon present in stands of oil palm, both in the palms themselves and in other biomass components of oil palm plantations, are crucial for assessing the net greenhouse gas (GHG) balance and carbon footprint of palm oil production. Carbon sequestered during the growth of the oil palm crop generally represents the largest item of the oil palm GHG budget, being second in magnitude only to land use change (LUC) or, for crops grown on peat soil, to microbial peat oxidation. In this article, alternative models available for assessing carbon stocks and carbon sequestration in oil palm plantations are examined taking into account factors such as palm age, planting density and soil type. Both linear and non-linear models are discussed and the crop and plantation components contributing to them are reviewed, as is the methodology used, which may involve destructive or non-destructive techniques, or a combination of both. Guidance is given for selecting the most appropriate model.

AB In the tundra, mosses play an important functional role regulating belowground and ecosystem processes, but there is still considerable uncertainty about how tundra moss communities will respond to climate change. We examined the effects of 5 years of in situ air and soil warming on net primary productivity (NPP), carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotope signatures (delta C-13 and delta N-15), and C:N in dominant Alaskan tundra mosses. Air warming increased mean air temperatures by up to 0.5A degrees C and resulted in an 80-90% reduction in NPP in the feather moss Pleurozium and the peat moss Sphagnum. Soil warming increased permafrost thaw depth by 12-18%, upper soil water content by 23-27%, and resulted in a threefold increase in Sphagnum NPP. delta C-13 was positively correlated with moss NPP, and increased by 0.5-1aEuro degrees in all mosses under soil warming. C:N was reduced in Sphagnum and Pleurozium, due to increases in tissue %N in the soil warming treatment, suggesting that moss N availability could increase as temperatures increases. Higher N availability in warmer conditions, however, may be offset by unfavorable moisture conditions for moss growth. Similar to responses in tundra vascular plant communities, our results forecast interspecific differences in productivity among tundra mosses. Specifically, air warming may reduce productivity in Sphagnum and Pleurozium, but soil warming could offset this response in Sphagnum. Such responses may lead to changes in tundra moss community structure and function as temperatures increase that have the potential to alter tundra C and N cycling in a future climate.

AB Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle and potentially have a significant impact on regional climate change. Restoring and rewetting the degraded peatlands is an urgent task. However, effects of rewetting on the carbon emissions of peatlands remain poorly understood. In this study, the process of rewetting a piece of the degraded Zoige alpine peatland was experimentally simulated and the derived results were compared with those of natural rewetting by monitoring CO2 and CH4 fluxes and other environmental factors before and after rewetting. The natural rewetting results showed that rewetting decreased ecosystem respiration (ER) by about 60%. Furthermore, rewetting increased CH4 emissions by 127%, decreased total carbon emissions (TCE) from 270 to 157 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), and decreased TCE from the entire ecosystem by 42%. The results of the controlled experiment showed that ER decreased gradually as the degree of rewetting was increased, and CH4 fluxes and changes in water level were significantly and positively correlated: CH4 fluxes increased from 0.3 (water level 20 cm) to 2.17 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) (water level 20 cm). After rewetting, the TCE of the whole ecosystem were significantly decreased. Regional observations showed that CO2 fluxes were significantly and negatively correlated to the water level; and the corresponding CO2 equivalent was significantly and positively correlated to the water level, while TCE were significantly and negatively correlated to the water level. Our findings indicate that rewetting can decrease carbon emissions and thus contribute in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change in alpine peatland.

AB Peatlands are poorly represented in global Earth system modeling frameworks. Here we add a peatland-specific land surface hydrology module (PEAT-CLSM) to the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) of the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) framework. The amended TOPMODEL approach of the original CLSM that uses topography characteristics to model catchment processes is discarded, and a peatland-specific model concept is realized in its place. To facilitate its utilization in operational GEOS efforts, PEAT-CLSM uses the basic structure of CLSM and the same global input data. Parameters used in PEAT-CLSM are based on literature data. A suite of CLSM and PEAT-CLSM simulations for peatland areas between 40 degrees N and 75 degrees N is presented and evaluated against a newly compiled data set of groundwater table depth and eddy covariance observations of latent and sensible heat fluxes in natural and seminatural peatlands. CLSM's simulated groundwater tables are too deep and variable, whereas PEAT-CLSM simulates a mean groundwater table depth of -0.20 m (snow-free unfrozen period) with moderate temporal fluctuations (standard deviation of 0.10 m), in significantly better agreement with in situ observations. Relative to an operational CLSM version that simply includes peat as a soil class, the temporal correlation coefficient is increased on average by 0.16 and reaches 0.64 for bogs and 0.66 for fens when driven with global atmospheric forcing data. In PEAT-CLSM, runoff is increased on average by 38% and evapotranspiration is reduced by 19%. The evapotranspiration reduction constitutes a significant improvement relative to eddy covariance measurements.

AB Predicted changes to the precipitation regime in many parts of the world include intensifying the distribution into lower frequency, large magnitude events. The corresponding alterations to the soil moisture regime may affect plant growth and soil respiration, particularly in peatlands, where large stores of organic carbon are due to gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) exceeding ecosystem respiration (ER). This study uses lab monoliths corroborated with field measurements to examine the effect of changing rainfall frequency on peatland moisture controls on CO2 uptake in an undisturbed cool temperate poor fen. Lab monoliths and field plots containing mosses, sedges, or shrubs received either 2.3, 1, or 0.5 precipitation events per week, with total rainfall held constant. Decreasing rain frequency led to lower near-surface volumetric moisture content (VMC), water table (WT), and soil tension for all vegetation types, with minimal effect on evapotranspiration. The presence of sedges in particular led to soil tensions of >= 100 cm of water for a sizeable duration (37 %) of the experiment. Altered rainfall frequencies affected GEP but had little effect on ER; overall, low-frequency rain led to a reduced net CO2 uptake for all three vegetation types. VMC had a strong control on GEP and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the Sphagnum capillifolium monoliths, and decreasing rainfall frequency influenced these relationships. Overall, communities dominated by mosses became net sources of CO2 after 3 days without rain, whereas sedge communities remained net sinks for up to 14 days without rain. The results of this study demonstrate the hydrological controls of peatland CO2 exchange dynamics influenced by changing precipitation frequency; furthermore, they suggest these predicted changes in frequency will lead to increased sedge GEP but limit the carbon-sink function of peatlands.

AB Premise of the study : The goal of this study was to illuminate the evolutionary history and ecological importance of plant mixotrophy-the uptake and utilization of exogenous organic compounds.
   Methods : We quantitatively assessed the effect of sugar amendments on laboratory growth of Sphagnum compactum as a representative emergent peat moss and two species of ecologically associated zygnematalean algae, Cylindrocystis brebissonii and Mougeotia sp.
   Key results : Together with observations published elsewhere, our results suggest that under carbon or light limitation, the uptake of exogenous sugars by cells of charophycean algae and peat mosses may help these organisms maintain positive carbon balance. Utilization of 1% glucose by aquatic-grown algae helped to relieve dissolved inorganic carbon limitation, enhancing photoautotrophic growth by factors of 9.0 and 1.7, respectively. After an 8-wk growth period, amendments of 1% and 2% glucose enhanced air-grown moss biomass by 28 and 39 times, respectively, that of controls lacking sugar amendments. After 9 wk, 1% fructose enhanced biomass by 21 times, and 2% sucrose enhanced biomass by 31 times.
   Conclusion : Our results indicate that plant mixotrophy is an early-evolved trait. The results also indicate that quantitative differences in sugar utilization by bryophytes and charophycean algae correlate with relative investments in protective cell-wall polyphenolics measured in previous studies, suggesting that sugar utilization may subsidize the cost of producing phenolic wall compounds in bryophytes.

AB Essential for successful bog restoration is the reestablishment of Sphagnum mosses. High carbon dioxide availability has been shown to be of great importance for the growth of Sphagnum mosses. In well-developed Sphagnum bogs large amounts of carbon dioxide are produced by (an)aerobic decomposition of the peat layer. In cut-over Sphagnum bogs this carbon source is often greatly reduced. In this study the importance of groundwater-derived carbon dioxide is demonstrated in aquatic environments, where Sphagnum species have started to form floating mats after former cutover activities by farmers. We discuss the results of measures taken to restore one of the largest wet heathland reserves in western Europe. After rewetting, some bogs developed markedly well, whereas others did not. The developmental success of 10 small bogs was quantified by analysing aerial photographs and sampling of surface and groundwater. The analysis of the ground- and surface water samples revealed that in the well-developed bogs there were significantly higher TIC/CO2 concentrations than in poorly developed bogs. It is concluded that in the early stages of bog formation the growth of Sphagnum is better in bog systems that are fed by an inflow of carbonrich groundwater from outside the bog. The present findings suggest that high carbon dioxide availability is a prerequisite for the successful reestablishment of Sphagnum mosses in peat-bog restoration projects and that carbon-rich groundwater can substitute for the carbon dioxide from decomposing peat.

AB Increased decomposition rates in boreal peatlands with global warming might increase the release of atmospheric greenhouse gases, thereby producing a positive feedback to global warming. How temperature influences microbial decomposers is unclear. We measured in vitro rates of decomposition of senesced sedge leaves and rhizomes (Carex aquatilis), from a fen, and peat moss (Sphagnum fuscum), from a bog, at 14 and 20degreesC by the three most frequently isolated fungi and bacteria from these materials. Decomposition rates of the bog litter decreased (5- to 17-fold) with elevated temperatures, and decomposition of the sedge litters was either enhanced (2- to 30-fold) or remained unaffected by elevated temperatures. The increased temperature regime always favoured fungal over bacterial decomposition rates (2- to 3-fold). Different physiological characteristics of these microbes suggest that fungi using polyphenolic polymers as a carbon source cause greater mass losses of these litters. Litter quality exerted a stronger influence on decomposition at elevated temperatures, as litter rich in nutrients decomposed more quickly than litter poorer in nutrients at higher temperatures (8.0%-25.7% for the sedge litters vs. 0.2% for the bryophyte litter). We conclude that not all peatlands may provide a positive feedback to global warming. Cautious extrapolation of our data to the ecosystem level suggests that decomposition rates in fens may increase and those in bogs may decrease under a global warming scenario.

AB The export of total organic carbon (particulate and dissolved) from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems has important implications for water quality and the global carbon cycle. However, most research to date has focused on DOC losses from either forested or peaty catchments, with only limited studies examining the controls and rates of total fluvial carbon losses from agricultural catchments, particularly during storm events. This study examined the controls and fluxes of total suspended sediment (SS), total particulate (TPC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from two adjacent catchments with contrasting intensive agricultural and semi-natural land-use. Data from 35 individual storm events showed that the agricultural catchment exported significantly higher SS concentrations on a storm-by-storm basis than the semi-natural catchment, with peak discharge exerting a greater control over SS, TPC and DOC concentrations. Baseflow DOC concentrations in the agricultural catchment were significantly higher. DOC quality monitored during one simultaneous rainfall event differed between the two study catchments, with more humic, higher molecular weight compounds prevailing in the agricultural catchment and lower molecular weight compounds prevailing in the semi-natural catchment. During an eight month period for which a comparable continuous turbidity record was available, the estimated SS yields from the agricultural catchment were higher than from the semi-natural catchment. Further, the agricultural catchment exported proportionally more TPC and a comparable amount of DOC, despite a lower total soil carbon pool. These results suggest that altered hydrological and biogeochemical processes within the agricultural catchment, including accelerated soil erosion and soil organic matter turnover, contributed to an enhanced fluvial SS and carbon export. Thus, we argue that enhancing semi-natural vegetation within intensively farmed catchments could reduce sediment and carbon losses from these areas and increase their resilience to more extreme hydrological events, anticipated as a result of climate change.

AB Boreal peat-forming wetlands, mires, are globally important sources of methane and sinks for CO2. As peatland vegetation plays a significant role regulating the exchange of these greenhouse gases, we have assessed the responses of the dominant plants and ecosystem functions to increasing tropospheric ozone concentration and enhanced ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation in long-term experiments, the results of which are summarized in this review. The dominant sedge, Eriophorum vaginatum, and especially the Sphagnum mosses common on peatlands, appear fairly tolerant to the future predicted ozone levels. Similarly, UV-B radiation only caused few alterations in the carbohydrates and pigments of the dominant sedge, Eriophorum russeolum, and had no effects on the dominant moss species of the experimental site, Warnstorfia exannulata. Surprisingly, there were alterations in organic acid concentrations in the peat pore water and peat microbial community composition in both experiments. Elevated ozone caused a transient decrease in ecosystem-level gross photosynthesis and methane (CH4) emission, which shifted to a slight increase later on. Enhanced UV-B decreased dark ecosystem respiration and increased CH4 emission in the course of the six measurement years. The emission of isoprene was increased by both ozone and UV-B during warm weather periods, suggesting interactive effects with temperature. All in all, we suggest that ozone and UV-B have limited effects on the carbon cycle in boreal peatlands, because other environmental factors, such as temperature, water level and photosynthetically active radiation more strongly regulate CO2 and CH4 exchange rates.

AB Organic matter in the terrestrial biosphere has a fundamental role in moderating the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the biosphere. One important property of organic matter is its oxidative ratio (OR); that is, the ratio of moles O-2 released per mole CO2 sequestered through photosynthesis, that is, the lower the OR, less O-2 is released per mole of CO2 fixed. In global assessments of CO2 partitioning, the failure to account for changes in OR could lead to an underestimate of terrestrial carbon sequestration. It is known that OR can vary between environments and management, but what other factors could be playing a role in controlling OR? This study measured the OR of a range of peat (Histosols) and mineral soils (Inceptisols) under similar management from across the United Kingdom to investigate how OR varies within and between material types. The study shows that OR values varied significantly between material types (median peat OR=1.10, median vegetation OR=1.03 and median mineral soil OR=1.14), and they also varied between study sites. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in OR with peat depth. Given the results from this study, we can suggest that future sampling strategies should include sampling of the major carbon pools (i.e. vegetation, litter and soil) and that, as a first approximation, OR can be examined on the basis of these carbon pools alone. The values measured in the study give a new residence time-weighted global OR estimate for the terrestrial biosphere (<mml:msubsup>ORterraglobal</mml:msubsup>) of 1.056 +/- 0.02.

AB The transfer of carbon from terrestrial peat to the fluvial environment forms an important component of the peatland carbon cycle and has major implications for water quality Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is generally considered the largest constituent of aquatic carbon and tends to be the most intensively monitored particularly in peatland catchments However many long-term records for DOG are based on proxy studies that use water colour as a surrogate This paper tests the robustness of using spectrophotometric techniques to monitor water colour based on absorbance from a single wavelength at 400 nm as a surrogate for true DOC determination The general ability of spectrophotometric analysis to measure low DOC concentrations depends on the calibration used thus the minimum mass of DOC detectable varies considerably and in this study was found to be as high as 10 32 mg C L-1 While there is often a significant correlation between water colour and DOG it was found that the use of single or even "pooled regressions to predict DOC concentrations could result in miscalculations of more than 50% Further the water colour-DOC relationship in blanket peat pore waters was found to vary significantly between peat layers land management treatments and through time Thus studies using long-term water colour records as a proxy for long-term DOC concentrations in peatlands must be treated with a certain degree of caution especially in cases where changes may have taken place to DOC production such as those caused by land management change during the course of investigation (C) 2010 Elsevier BV All rights reserved

AB The extensive blanket peatlands of the UK uplands account for almost half of total national terrestrial carbon storage. However, much of the blanket peat is severely eroded so that the contemporary role of the peatland system in carbon sequestration is compromised by losses of organic carbon in dissolved (DOC) and particulate (POC) form in the fluvial system. This paper presents the first detailed assessment of dissolved and organic carbon losses from a severely eroded headwater peatland (River Ashop, South Pennines, UK). Total annual fluvial organic carbon losses range from 29106?Mg?C km,-2 decreasing from the headwaters to the main catchment outlet. In contrast to less eroded systems fluvial organic carbon flux is dominated by POC center dot POC:DOC ratios decrease from values of 4 in the headwaters to close to unity at the catchment outlet. These results demonstrate the importance of eroding headwater sites as sources of POC to the fluvial system. Comparison with a range of catchment characteristics reveals that drainage density is the best predictor of POC:DOC but there is scatter in the relation in the headwaters. Steep declines in specific POC yield from headwater catchments are consistent with storage of POC within the fluvial system. Key to the significance of fluvial carbon flux in greenhouse gas budgets is understanding the fate of fluvial carbon. Further work on the fate of POC and the role of floodplains in fluvial carbon cycling is urgently required. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Permafrost in peatlands strongly influences ecosystem characteristics, including vegetation composition, hydrological functions, and carbon cycling. Large amounts of organic carbon are stored in permafrost peatlands in northwestern Canada. Their possible degradation into permafrost-free wetlands including thermokarst bogs may affect carbon (C) stocks, but the direction and magnitude of change are uncertain. Using peat core reconstructions, we characterized the temporal and spatial variability in vegetation macrofossil, testate amoebae, C content, and peat decomposition along a permafrost thaw chronosequence in the southern portion of the Scotty Creek watershed near Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories. The accumulation of limnic and minerotrophic peat prevailed at the site until permafrost formed around 5000 cal. yr BP. Three distinct permafrost periods were identified in the permafrost peat plateau profile, while permafrost only aggraded once in the thermokarst bog profile. Permafrost thawed at similar to 550 and similar to 90 cal. yr BP in the thermokarst bog center and edge, respectively. Both allogenic (climatic shifts and wildfire) and autogenic (peat accumulation, Sphagnum growth) processes likely exerted control on permafrost aggradation and thaw. While apparent carbon accumulation rates (ACARs) were lower during present and past permafrost periods than during non-permafrost periods, long-term C accumulation remained similar between cores with different permafrost period lengths. Deep peat was less decomposed in the permafrost plateau compared with the thermokarst bog, which we speculate is due more to differences in peat type rather than differences in decomposition environment between these two ecosystem states. Our study highlights the importance of considering potential deep peat C losses to project the fate of thawing permafrost peat C stores.

AB To predict the role of ombrotrophic bogs as carbon sinks in the future, it is crucial to understand how Sphagnum vegetation in bogs will respond to global change. We performed a greenhouse experiment to study the effects of two temperature treatments (17.5 and 21.7A degrees C) and two N addition treatments (0 and 4 g N m(-2) year(-1)) on the growth of four Sphagnum species from three geographically interspersed regions: S. fuscum, S. balticum (northern and central Sweden), S. magellanicum and S. cuspidatum (southern Sweden). We studied the growth and cover change in four combinations of these Sphagnum species during two growing seasons. Sphagnum height increment and production were affected negatively by high temperature and high N addition. However, the northern species were more affected by temperature, while the southern species were more affected by N addition. High temperature depressed the cover of the 'wet' species, S. balticum and S. cuspidatum. Nitrogen concentrations increased with high N addition. N:P and N:K ratios indicated P-limited growth in all treatments and co-limitation of P and K in the high N treatments. In the second year of the experiment, several containers suffered from a severe fungal infection, particularly affecting the 'wet' species and the high N treatment. Our findings suggest that global change can have negative consequences for the production of Sphagnum species in bogs, with important implications for the carbon sequestration in these ecosystems.

AB Sphagnum-dominated peatlands comprise a globally important pool of soil carbon (C) and are vulnerable to climate change. While peat mosses of the genus Sphagnum are known to harbor diverse microbial communities that mediate C and nitrogen (N) cycling in peatlands, the effects of climate change on Sphagnum microbiome composition and functioning are largely unknown. We investigated the impacts of experimental whole-ecosystem warming on the Sphagnum moss microbiome, focusing on N-2 fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs). To characterize the microbiome response to warming, we performed next-generation sequencing of small subunit (SSU) rRNA and nitrogenase (nifH) gene amplicons and quantified rates of N-2 fixation activity in Sphagnum fallax individuals sampled from experimental enclosures over 2 years in a northern Minnesota, USA bog. The taxonomic diversity of overall microbial communities and diazotroph communities, as well as N-2 fixation rates, decreased with warming (p < 0.05). Following warming, diazotrophs shifted from a mixed community of Nostocales (Cyanobacteria) and Rhizobiales (Alphaproteobacteria) to predominance of Nostocales. Microbiome community composition differed between years, with some diazotroph populations persisting while others declined in relative abundance in warmed plots in the second year. Our results demonstrate that warming substantially alters the community composition, diversity, and N-2 fixation activity of peat moss microbiomes, which may ultimately impact host fitness, ecosystem productivity, and C storage potential in peatlands.

AB Despite the global importance of understanding the effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deposition on carbon (C) cycling in northern peatlands, the control of N and P interactions through the 'enzymatic latch' mechanism has been largely overlooked. A long-term fertilization experiment in a moderate-rich fen in northeast China was conducted to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of how continuous N and P addition regulate key extracellular enzymes and their interactions, and the subsequent influences on organic C storage in peatlands. The results demonstrated that the growth of Sphagnum moss and vascular plants were both reduced by N addition but enhanced by P addition. Phenolic concentrations were higher in P addition treatments, as were phenol oxidase activities. In general, N addition played a critical role in regulating the stoichiometry of beta-D-glucosidase, N acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and phosphatase, while P addition was more important in regulating their activities. The direct and indirect effects due to fertilization and shifts in vegetational composition, respectively, weakened the 'enzymatic latch' mechanism that controls the decomposition of organic matter after long-term fertilization. Our results indicate that P likely plays a more important role than N in controlling microbial extracellular enzymatic activities and organic matter decomposition in northern minerotrophic peatlands. Consequently, the interactions between N and P is likely of primary significance in regulating the biogeochemical cycling of peatlands.

AB Saltwater intrusion and salinization of coastal wetlands around the world are becoming a pressing issue due to sea level rise. Here, we assessed how a freshwater coastal wetland ecosystem responds to saltwater intrusion. In wetland mesocosms, we continuously exposed Cladium jamaicense Crantz (sawgrass) plants and their peat soil collected from a freshwater marsh to two factors associated with saltwater intrusion in karstic ecosystems: elevated loading of salinity and phosphorus (P) inputs. We took repeated measures using a 2 9 2 factorial experimental design (n = 6) with treatments composed of elevated salinity (similar to 9 ppt), P loading (14.66 mu mol P/d), or a combination of both. We measured changes in water physicochemistry, ecosystem productivity, and plant biomass change over two years to assess monthly and two-year responses to saltwater intrusion. In the short-term, plants exhibited positive growth responses with simulated saltwater intrusion (salinity + P), driven by increased P availability. Despite relatively high salinity levels for a freshwater marsh (similar to 9 ppt), gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and aboveground biomass were significantly higher in the elevated salinity + P treated monoliths compared to the freshwater controls. Salinity stress became evident after extended exposure. Although still higher than freshwater controls, GEP and NEP were significantly lower in the elevated salinity + P treatment than the + P treatment after two years. However, elevated salinity decreased live root biomass regardless of whether P was added. Our results suggest that saltwater intrusion into karstic freshwater wetlands may initially act as a subsidy by stimulating aboveground primary productivity of marsh plants. However, chronic exposure to elevated salinity results in plant stress, negatively impacting belowground peat soil structure and stability through a reduction in plant roots.

AB Disease suppression against Pythium root rot can be influenced by management practices applied in ornamental bulb culture. Different levels of suppression were established in sandy soil after several soil treatments. Percentage of infection in Iris caused by Pythium macrosporum was lowest in untreated soil and progressively increased in sterilized soil amended with 1% compost, fumigated soil (methylisothiocyanate) and flooded soil (fumigation and flooding corresponding to the same level of disease severity) and was highest in sterilized soil. The relationship between the level of disease incidence, Pythium growth rate through soil, and various microbial parameters was investigated. Soil microbial biomass and, after amendment of glucose as a non-selective carbon source, dehydrogenase activity, glucose uptake and respiration were determined. By using C-14-labelled glucose, measurement of uptake and assimilation of amended carbon could be distuingished from soil organic matter decomposition. All microbial parameters were negatively associated with Pythium growth rates, indicating that high microbial biomass and activity induced suppression of Pythium growth through soil. However, with neither of the quantitative microbial parameters could chances in disease incidence be fully explained. It is hypothesized that competition for carbon may not be the main mechanism in disease suppression. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Permafrost stores globally significant amounts of carbon (C) which may start to decompose and be released to the atmosphere in form of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) as global warming promotes extensive thaw. This permafrost carbon feedback to climate is currently considered to be the most important carbon-cycle feedback missing from climate models. Predicting the magnitude of the feedback requires a better understanding of how differences in environmental conditions post-thaw, particularly hydrological conditions, control the rate at which C is released to the atmosphere. In the sporadic and discontinuous permafrost regions of north-west Canada, we measured the rates and sources of C released from relatively undisturbed ecosystems, and compared these with forests experiencing thaw following wildfire (well-drained, oxic conditions) and collapsing peat plateau sites (water-logged, anoxic conditions). Using radiocarbon analyses, we detected substantial contributions of deep soil layers and/or previously-frozen sources in our well-drained sites. In contrast, no loss of previously-frozen C as CO2 was detected on average from collapsed peat plateaus regardless of time since thaw and despite the much larger stores of available C that were exposed. Furthermore, greater rates of new peat formation resulted in these soils becoming stronger C sinks and this greater rate of uptake appeared to compensate for a large proportion of the increase in CH4 emissions from the collapse wetlands. We conclude that in the ecosystems we studied, changes in soil moisture and oxygen availability may be even more important than previously predicted in determining the effect of permafrost thaw on ecosystem C balance and, thus, it is essential to monitor, and simulate accurately, regional changes in surface wetness.

AB Peatland soils play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle due to their high organic carbon content. Lowering of the water table e.g. for agricultural use accelerates aerobic secondary peat decomposition and processes of earthification. Peatlands change from C sinks to C sources. We characterized soil organic matter (SOM) with special attention to human impact through drainage. Our aim was to gain knowledge of SOM quality and soil-forming processes in drained fen soils in northeastern Germany.
   Through techniques of representative landscape analysis, we identified two typical and representative sampling sites in different stages of land use, representing the most important hydrogenetic mire types in northeastern Germany. We adapted chemical fractionation procedures which include hot water extraction (C-hwe and N-hwe) for determination of the labile fraction. Furthermore, a stepwise acid hydrolysis procedure was performed to measure the chemical recalcitrant part of SOM as it is more resistant to biodegradability.
   Total organic C decreased with increasing human impact and intensity of drainage. Conversely, C-hwe and N-hwe concentrations increased with increasing drainage and human impact. In contrast, the more recalcitrant fractions increased with soil depth.
   Generally, there is a lack of existing data about SOM quality and the factors controlling its stability and decomposition in fen soils. For northeastern German fen soils, the data are even more inadequate. Influence of drainage seems to overlap natural influences of site on SOM quality. The used extraction scheme was suitable for the chemical fractionation of SOM into labile and more recalcitrant parts.

AB The major increase in atmospheric methane (CH4) concentration during the last glacial-interglacial transition provides a useful example for understanding the interactions and feedbacks among Earth's climate, biosphere carbon cycling, and atmospheric chemistry. However, the causes of CH4 doubling during the last deglaciation are still uncertain and debated. Although the ice-core data consistently suggest a dominant contribution from northern high-latitude wetlands in the early Holocene, identifying the actual sources from the ground-based data has been elusive. Here we present data syntheses and a case study from Alaska to demonstrate the importance of northern wetlands in contributing to high atmospheric CH4 concentration in the early Holocene. Our data indicate that new peatland formation as well as peat accumulation in northern high-latitude regions increased more than threefold in the early Holocene in response to climate warming and the availability of new habitat as a result of deglaciation. Furthermore, we show that marshes and wet fens that represent early stages of wetland succession were likely more widespread in the early Holocene. These wetlands are associated with high CH4 emissions due to high primary productivity and the presence of emergent plant species that facilitate CH4 transport to the atmosphere. We argue that early wetland succession and rapid peat accumulation and expansion (not simply initiation) contributed to high CH4 emissions from northern regions, potentially contributing to the sharp rise in atmospheric CH4 at the onset of the Holocene.

AB There is a strong correlation between iron oxide mineral and organic carbon (OC) concentrations. However, the role of iron oxide minerals in the preservation of OC in peatlands is poorly understood. In this study, we collected soil samples from 10 peatlands in central and west China to comprehensively investigate the concentration, characteristics, and spatial variability of iron oxide-bound OC (Fe-bound OC) concentrations and determine the impact of climatic factors and soil physicochemical properties on the correlation between OC and iron oxides. Our results showed that the concentration of Fe-bound OC ranged from 3.91 to 18.79 g kg(-1). On average, Febound OC accounted for 3.42 +/- 1.32% of soil OC. The molar ratio of OC: Fe ranged from 2.17 to 12.18, indicating that coprecipitation was the dominant mechanism affecting the binding of OC to reactive iron oxides in peatlands. delta C-13 isotope analyses revealed that Fe-bound OC was relatively enriched in C-13 in peatlands. Iron mineral sources, local vegetation, and the water table were responsible for differences in the concentration of Febound OC identified among the 10 sites. Correlation analysis results indicated that total organic carbon (TOC) was the main determinant factor for the concentration of Fe-bound OC (r = 0.549, p < 0.01), and the binding mechanism was jointly regulated by TOC and reactive Fe content. The proportion of Fe-bound OC to TOC (f(Fe-bound) (OC)) was positively correlated with the reactive Fe (r = 0.457, p < 0.05), indicating that the importance of binding with iron minerals in OC accumulation is regulated by the concentration of reactive Fe in peatlands. This study highlights the quantitative characteristics and spatial variability of Fe-bound OC in peatlands, providing important information for assessing and managing the carbon cycle in peatland ecosystems.

AB This article examines alternative forest harvesting regimes when ecosystem services in terms of water quality, biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation are included in the analysis. The harvesting regimes are whole-tree harvesting with stump removal and conventional stem-only harvesting. The harvesting regimes are evaluated under two alternative climate policy contexts. The first alternative is a carbon neutral bioenergy policy, which assumes the carbon dioxide (CO2) neutrality of bioenergy and produces substitution benefits, as bioenergy replaces fossil fuels. The second alternative climate policy, a carbon non-neutral bioenergy policy, takes into account the fact that bioenergy causes carbon dioxide emissions, producing substitution costs, and that harvested woody biomass affects the ability of a forest to act as a carbon sink. We extend the traditional Faustmann (1849) rotation model to include nutrient load damage, biodiversity benefits, and climate impacts. The empirical analysis is based on Finnish data from a catchment experiment carried out on drained peatland forests. The empirical results show that under a carbon neutral bioenergy policy, whole-tree harvesting with stump removal produces the highest net social benefits. However, if a carbon non-neutral bioenergy policy is assumed, the net social benefits are greater under stem-only harvesting. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Stream water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations display high spatial and temporal variation in boreal catchments. Understanding and predicting these patterns is a challenge with great implications for water quality projections and carbon balance estimates. Although several biogeochemical models have been used to estimate stream water DOC dynamics, model biases common during both rain and snowmelt-driven events. The parsimonious DOC-model, K-DOC, with 10 calibrated parameters, uses a nonlinear discharge and catchment water storage relationship including soil temperature dependencies of DOC release and consumption. K-DOC was used to estimate the stream water DOC concentrations over 5 years for eighteen nested boreal catchments having total area of 68 km(2) (varying from 0.04 to 67.9 km(2)). The model successfully simulated DOC concentrations during base flow conditions, as well as, hydrological events in catchments dominated by organic and mineral soils reaching NSEs from 0.46 to 0.76. Our semimechanistic model was parsimonious enough to have all parameters estimated using statistical methods. We did not find any clear differences between forest and mire-dominated catchments that could be explained by soil type or tree species composition. However, parameters controlling slow release and consumption of DOC from soil water behaved differently for small head-water catchments (less than 2 km(2)) than for those that integrate larger areas of different ecosystem types (1068 km(2)). Our results emphasize that it is important to account for nonlinear dependencies of both, soil temperature, and catchment water storage, when simulating DOC dynamics of boreal catchments.

AB The development of northern high-latitude peatlands played an important role in the carbon (C) balance of the land biosphere since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). At present, carbon storage in northern peatlands is substantial and estimated to be 500 100 Pg C (1 Pg C = 1015 g C). Here, we develop and apply a peatland module embedded in a dynamic global vegetation and land surface process model (LPX-Bern 1.0). The peatland module features a dynamic nitrogen cycle, a dynamic C transfer between peatland acrotelm (upper oxic layer) and catotelm (deep anoxic layer), hydrology- and temperature-dependent respiration rates, and peatland specific plant functional types. Nitrogen limitation down-regulates average modern net primary productivity over peatlands by about half. Decadal acrotelm-to-catotelm C fluxes vary between 20 and +50 g C M-2 yr-1 over the Holocene. Key model parameters are calibrated with reconstructed peat accumulation rates from peat-core data. The model reproduces the major features of the peat core data and of the observation-based modern circumpolar soil carbon distribution. Results from a set of simulations for possible evolutions of northern peat development and areal extent show that soil C stocks in modern peatlands increased by 365-550 Pg C since the LGM, of which 175-272 Pg C accumulated between 11 and 5 kyr BR Furthermore, our simulations suggest a persistent C sequestration rate of 35-50 Pg C per 1000 yr in present-day peatlands under current climate conditions, and that this C sink could either sustain or turn towards a source by 2100 AD depending on climate trajectories as projected for different representative greenhouse gas concentration pathways.

AB The depth of the groundwater table below the surface and its spatiotemporal variability are major controls on all major biogeophysical processes in northern peatlands, including ecohydrology, carbon balance, and greenhouse gas exchange. In these ecosystems, water table fluctuations are buffered by compression and expansion of peat. Controls on peat volume change and its spatial variability, however, remain elusive, hampering accurate assessment of climate change impact on functioning of peatlands. We therefore (1) analysed patterning of seasonal surface elevation change at high spatial resolution (0.5 m); (2) assessed its relationship with vegetation, geohydrology, and position within the peatland; and (3) quantified the consequences for peatland surface topography and ecohydrology. Changes in surface elevation were monitored using digital close-range photogrammetry along a transect in a northern peatland from after snowmelt up to midgrowing season (May-July). Surface elevation change was substantial and varied spatially from -0.062 to +0.012 m over the measurement period. Spatial patterns of peat volume change were correlated up to 40.8 m. Spatial variation of peat volume change was mainly controlled by changes in water table, and to a lesser extent to vegetation, with peat volume change magnitude increasing from lawn < hollow < flark. Our observations suggest that patchiness and vertical variability of peatland surface topography are a function of the groundwater table. In dry conditions, the variability of surface elevation increases and more localized groundwater flows may develop. Consequently, spatially variable peat volume change may enhance peatland water retention and thereby sustain carbon uptake during drought.

AB Climate warming is expected to mobilize northern permafrost and peat organic carbon (PP-C), yet magnitudes and system specifics of even current releases are poorly constrained. While part of the PP-C will degrade at point of thaw to CO2 and CH4 to directly amplify global warming, another part will enter the fluvial network, potentially providing a window to observe large-scale PP-C remobilization patterns. Here, we employ a decade-long, high-temporal resolution record of C-14 in dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC, respectively) to deconvolute PP-C release in the large drainage basins of rivers across Siberia: Ob, Yenisey, Lena, and Kolyma. The C-14-constrained estimate of export specifically from PP-C corresponds to only 17 +/- 8% of total fluvial organic carbon and serves as a benchmark for monitoring changes to fluvial PP-C remobilization in a warming Arctic. Whereas DOC was dominated by recent organic carbon and poorly traced PP-C (12 +/- 8%), POC carried a much stronger signature of PP-C (63 +/- 10%) and represents the best window to detect spatial and temporal dynamics of PP-C release. Distinct seasonal patterns suggest that while DOC primarily stems from gradual leaching of surface soils, POC reflects abrupt collapse of deeper deposits. Higher dissolved PP-C export by Ob and Yenisey aligns with discontinuous permafrost that facilitates leaching, whereas higher particulate PP-C export by Lena and Kolyma likely echoes the thermokarst-induced collapse of Pleistocene deposits. Quantitative C-14-based fingerprinting of fluvial organic carbon thus provides an opportunity to elucidate large-scale dynamics of PP-C remobilization in response to Arctic warming.

AB Peatlands provide important ecosystem services including carbon storage and biodiversity conservation. Remote sensing shows potential for monitoring peatlands, but most off-the-shelf data products are developed for unsaturated environments and it is unclear how well they can perform in peatland ecosystems. Sphagnum moss is an important peatland genus with specific characteristics which can affect spectral reflectance, and we hypothesized that the prevalence of Sphagnum in a peatland could affect the spectral signature of the area. This article combines results from both laboratory and field experiments to assess the relationship between spectral indices and the moisture content and gross primary productivity (GPP) of peatland (blanket bog) vegetation species. The aim was to consider how well the selected indices perform under a range of conditions, and whether Sphagnum has a significant impact on the relationships tested. We found that both water indices tested [normalized difference water index (NDWI) and floating water band index (fWBI)] were sensitive to the water content changes in Sphagnum moss in the laboratory, and there was little difference between them. Most of the vegetation indices tested [the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), structure insensitive pigment index (SIPI), and chlorophyll index (CIm)] were found to have a strong relationship with GPP both in the laboratory and in the field. The NDVI and EVI are useful for large-scale estimation of GPP, but are sensitive to the proportion of Sphagnum present. The CIm is less affected by different species proportions and might therefore be the best to use in areas where vegetation species cover is unknown. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) is shown to be best suited to small-scale studies of single species.

AB One of the major concerns regarding climate change in high latitudes is the potential feedback from greenhouse gases (GHG) being released from thawing peat soils. In this paper we show how vegetational patterns and associated GHG fluxes in subarctic palsa (peat mounds with a permanently frozen core) mires can be linked to climate, based on field observations from fifteen palsa sites distributed in northern Fennoscandia. Fine resolution (100 m) land cover data are combined with projections of future climate for the 21st century in order to model the potential future distribution of palsa vegetation in northern Fennoscandia. Site scale climate-vegetational relationships for two vegetation types are described by a climate suitability index computed from the field observations. Our results indicate drastic changes in the palsa vegetational patterns over the coming decades with a 97 % reduction in dry hummock areas by 2041-2060 compared to the 1961-1990 areal coverage. The impact of these changes on the carbon balance is a decrease in the efflux of CO2 from 130 kilotonnes C y(-1) to a net uptake of 11 kilotonnes C y(-1) and a threefold increase in the efflux of CH4 from 6 to 18 kilotonnes C y(-1) over the same period and over the 5,520 km(2) area of palsa mires. The combined effect is equivalent to a slight decrease in CO2-C emissions, from 182 to 152 kilotonnes C y(-1). Main uncertainties involve the ability of the vegetation community to adapt to new conditions, and long-term changes in hydrology due to absence of ice and frost heaving.

AB River water is the main source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the Arctic Ocean. DOC plays an important role in the Arctic carbon cycle, and its export from land to sea is expected to increase as ongoing climate change accelerates permafrost thaw. However, transport pathways and transformation of DOC in the land-to-ocean transition are mostly unknown. We collected DOC and a(CDOM)(lambda)/samples from 11 expeditions to river, coastal and offshore waters and present a new DOC- a(CDOM)(lambda)/model for the fluvial-marine transition zone in the Laptev Sea. The a(CDOM) (lambda)/characteristics revealed that the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in samples of this dataset are primarily of terrigenous origin. Observed changes in a(CDOM)(443) and its spectral slopes indicate that DOM is modified by microbial and photodegradation. Ocean colour remote sensing (OCRS) provides the absorption coefficient of coloured dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)(lambda)/(sat)) at lambda = 440 or 443 nm, which can be used to estimate DOC concentration at high temporal and spatial resolution over large regions. We tested the statistical performance of five OCRS algorithms and evaluated the plausibility of the spatial distribution of derived a(CDOM)(lambda)/(sat). The OLCI (Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) neural network swarm (ONNS) algorithm showed the best performance compared to in situ a(CDOM)(440) (r(2) = 0 : 72). Additionally, we found ONNS-derived a(CDOM)(440), in contrast to other algorithms, to be partly independent of sediment concentration, making ONNS the most suitable a(CDOM)(lambda)/sat algorithm for the Laptev Sea region. The DOC-a(CDOM)(lambda)/model was applied to ONNS-derived a(CDOM)(440), and retrieved DOC concentration maps showed moderate agreement to in situ data (r(2) = 0.53). The in situ and satellite-retrieved data were offset by up to several days, which may partly explain the weak correlation for this dynamic region. Satellite-derived surface water DOC concentration maps from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) satellite data demonstrate rapid removal of DOC within short time periods in coastal waters of the Laptev Sea, which is likely caused by physical mixing and different types of degradation processes. Using samples from all occurring water types leads to a more robust DOC-a(CDOM)(lambda)/model for the retrievals of DOC in Arctic shelf and river waters.

AB Globally, coastal lowlands are becoming more saline by the combined effects of sea level rise, land subsidence and altered hydrological and climatic conditions. Although salinization is known to have a great influence on biogeochemical processes, literature shows contrasting effects that challenge the prediction of future effects. In addition, the effects of fluctuating salinity levels, a more realistic scenario than constant levels, on nutrient cycling in coastal wetland sediments have hardly been examined. A better understanding is therefore crucial for the prediction of future effects and the definition of effective management. To test the effects of constantly brackish water (50 mmol Cl l(-1), 3.2 psu) or fluctuating salinity (5-50 mmol Cl l(-1)), versus constantly low salinity (5 mmol Cl l(-1), 0.32 psu) on nutrient biogeochemistry, we conducted a controlled laboratory experiment with either peat or clay sediments from coastal wetlands. Increased salinity showed to have a fast and large effect. Sediment cation exchange appeared to be the key process explaining both a decrease in phosphorus availability (through calcium mobilization) and an increase in nitrogen availability, their extent being strongly dependent on sediment type. Supply of brackish water decreased surface water turbidity and inhibited sediment methane production but did not affect CO2 production. Constant and fluctuating salinity levels showed similar longer term effects on nutrient and carbon cycling. The contrasting effects of salinization found for nitrogen and phosphorus, and its effects on water turbidity indicate major ecological consequences for coastal wetlands and have important implications for water management and nature restoration.

AB An original method is proposed for estimating past carbon emissions from fires in order to understand long-term changes in the biomass burning that, together with vegetation cover, act on the global carbon cycle and climate. The past carbon release resulting from paleo-fires during the Holocene is examined using a simple linear model between measured carbon emissions from modern fires and sedimentary charcoal records of biomass burning within boreal and cold temperate forests in eastern Canada (Quebec, Ontario). Direct carbon emissions are estimated for each ecozone for the present period and the fire anomaly per kilo annum (ka) v. present day (0 ka) deduced from charcoal series of 46 lakes and peats. Over the postglacial, the Taiga Shield ecozone does not match the pattern of fire history and carbon release of Boreal Shield, Atlantic Maritime, and Mixedwood Plains ecozones. This feature results from different air mass influences and the timing of vegetation dynamics. Our estimations show, first, that the contribution of the Mixedwood Plains and the Atlantic Maritime ecozones on the total carbon emissions by fires remains negligible compared with the Boreal Shield. Second, the Taiga Shield plays a key role by maintaining important carbon emissions, given it is today a lower contributor.

AB The composition and biodegradability of streamwater dissolved organic matter (DOM) varies with source material and degree of transformation. We combined PARAFAC modeling of fluorescence excitation-emission spectroscopy and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) incubations to investigate seasonal changes in the lability of DOM along a soil-stream continuum in three soil types: bog, forested wetland and upland forest. The percent BDOC ranged from 7 to 38% across all sites, and was significantly greater in soil compared to streamwater in the bog and forested wetland, but not in the upland forest. The percent BDOC also varied significantly over the entire sampling period in soil and streamwater for the bog and forested wetland, as BDOC peaked during the spring runoff and was lowest during the summer months. Moreover, the chemical quality of DOM in wetland soil and streamwater was similar during the spring runoff and fall wet season, as demonstrated by the similar contribution of protein-like fluorescence (sum of tyrosine and tryptophan fluorescence) in soil water and in streams. These findings suggest that the tight coupling between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is responsible for the delivery of labile DOM from wetland soils to streams. The contribution of protein-like fluorescence was significantly correlated with BDOC (p < 0.001) over the entire sampling period indicating DOM is an important source of C and N for heterotrophic microbes. Taken together, our findings suggest that the production of protein-rich, labile DOM and subsequent loss in stream runoff might be an important loss of labile C and N from coastal temperate watersheds.

AB Despite their importance as globally significant carbon (C) stores, basic knowledge of post-glacial peatland history and C accumulation are lacking for the Canadian Boreal Shield and James Bay Lowland (JBL) of central and northern Ontario, Canada. Radiocarbon dates, plant macrofossil analysis, and soil C estimates from an eight-core transect of the JBL and surrounding regions are used to reconstruct the timings and patterns of fen to bog transitions, and the ranges and patterns of long-term apparent rate of C accumulation (LARCA). Peatland initiation lagged the retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet, the drainage of glacial lakes, and isostatic uplift by 810-6050 years. Transition from Carex-dominated fen to Sphagnum-dominated bog had a median timing of 3500 years following peatland establishment and ranged from 640 to 6970 years. LARCA was variable geographically and over time with median values ranging from 13.4 to 31.6 g C/m(2)/yr. LARCA anomalies were generally high similar to 6.1 kyr (kyr = 1000 calibrated years before present (cal. yr BP)) for southern sites, and similar to 2.5 kyr for the most northern sites, and may be associated with elevated moisture as inferred from a brief review of regional proxy reconstructions. Some sites displayed high LARCA anomalies, changes in plant ecology, or southern site initiation, which may have also been driven by a moist Hypsithermal Period occurring similar to 4.5 kyr. LARCA increases were not generally associated with high-temperature anomalies during the warm 'Medieval Climate Anomaly' compared with the cooler 'Little Ice Age'; however, there is evidence that the establishment of modern permafrost during the late-Holocene negatively affected C accumulation.

AB A large proportion of northern peatlands consists of Sphagnum-dominated ombrotrophic bogs. In these bogs, peat mosses (Sphagnum) and vascular plants occur in an apparent stable equilibrium, thereby sustaining the carbon sink function of the bog ecosystem. How global warming and increased nitrogen (N) deposition will affect the species composition in bog vegetation is still unclear. We performed a transplantation experiment in which mesocosms with intact vegetation were transplanted southward from north Sweden to north-east Germany along a transect of four bog sites, in which both temperature and N deposition increased. In addition, we monitored undisturbed vegetation in control plots at the four sites of the latitudinal gradient. Four growing seasons after transplantation, ericaceous dwarf shrubs had become much more abundant when transplanted to the warmest site which also had highest N deposition. As a result ericoid aboveground biomass in the transplanted mesocosms increased most at the southernmost site, this site also had highest ericoid biomass in the undisturbed vegetation. The two dominant Sphagnum species showed opposing responses when transplanted southward; Sphagnum balticum height increment decreased, whereas S. fuscum height increment increased when transplanted southward. Sphagnum production did not differ significantly among the transplanted mesocosms, but was lowest in the southernmost control plots. The dwarf shrub expansion and increased N concentrations in plant tissues we observed, point in the direction of a positive feedback toward vascular plant-dominance suppressing peat-forming Sphagnum in the long term. However, our data also indicate that precipitation and phosphorus availability influence the competitive balance between Sphagnum, dwarf shrubs and graminoids.

AB The Zoige peatland is the largest alpine peatland in the world, and it is suffering the threat of water table decline. Plant productivity and species composition are important to ecosystem carbon sequestration and soil carbon input in peatlands. We examined the responses of plant community composition and biomass accumulation to water table decline to better understanding the responses of this peatland to environmental changes. A four-year in situ field experiment was conducted involving three treatments: deep, shallow, and control water tables, which were achieved by experimental drainage with 50 cm, 20 cm, and 0 cm deep ditches, respectively. Experimental drainage decreased the annual mean height of water table by ca. 12 cm and 15 cm (relative to the control) in the shallow and deep water table treatments, respectively, over the four years. The response of aboveground plant biomass (APB) to water table decline declined in the first year, remained unchanged in the second year and increased during the third and fourth years. However, water table decline had a non-significant effect on belowground plant biomass. This duration-dependent response of APB can be attributed to the changes in community species composition during the study years. Specifically, the negative effect of water table decline in the first year was due to the significant decrease in APB of hygrophytes (sedges and rushes). In the second year, although water table decline significantly increased APB of mesophytes (grasses and forbs), this increase was offset by the decrease in APB of hygrophytes, leading to a neutral effect. In both the third and fourth years, the extent of the increase in APB of mesophytes (typically the forb species Anemone trullifolia var. linearis) was greater than that of the decrease in APB of hygrophytes, leading to a positive effect. Our results indicate that short-term decline of the water table may increase the primary productivity by shifting dominant species of hygrophytes to mesophytes in the Zogie peatland.

AB The results of long-term investigations performed by researchers from the Department of Soil Biology at the Faculty of Soil Science of Moscow State University into one of the major functions of soil microorganisms-sustenance of the turnover of matter and energy in the biosphere-are discussed. Data on the population densities of soil microbes and on the microbial biomass in different types of soils are presented. The systemic approach has been applied to study the structural-functional organization of the soil microbial communities. The role of eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms in the carbon and nitrogen cycles is elucidated. It is argued that the high population density and diversity of microorganisms are necessary to maintain the turnover of chemical elements in terrestrial ecosystems. The viability of microbes stored in the soils is important. New data on the preservation and survival of bacteria in nanoforms are presented. It is shown that peatlands and paleosols are natural banks, where microbes can be preserved in a viable state for tens of thousands years.

AB Extraction of oil from the Alberta Oil Sands through surface mining involves the removal of the overburden and oil sand to a depth of up to 100 m and over extremely large areas. While the operation of the bitumen processing plants has serious environmental impacts on downstream habitats, this article focuses on the reclamation of areas from which the oil sands have been removed, processed, and returned. This reclamation following closure of the mines will entail the complete re-creation of landforms and ecosystems at a landscape scale, with the goal of producing suitable habitats for plants, animals, and people. Such projects will require a reasonable understanding of the geophysical and ecological processes that operate at a wide range of scales. Some information is provided on the climate, hydrology, vegetation, and land use (past and current) of the Oil Sands area, situated within the Boreal Plain ecozone, to provide a framework for discussion of issues to be addressed in, and proposed guidelines for, such large-scale reclamation. Although none of the mines has yet closed, numerous consultant reports have been produced with recommendations for various aspects of such reclamation projects (e.g., wetland hydrology, vegetation, wildlife habitat). The scientific basis of such reports is found to vary with respect to depth of understanding of the relevant processes.

AB The fires around Moscow in July and August 2010 emitted a large amount of pollutants to the atmosphere. Here we estimate the carbon monoxide (CO) source strength of the Moscow fires in July and August by using the TM5-4DVAR system in combination with CO column observations of the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI). It is shown that the IASI observations provide a strong constraint on the total emissions needed in the model. Irrespective of the prior emissions used, the optimised CO fire emission estimates from mid-July to mid-August 2010 amount to approximately 24 TgCO. This estimate depends only weakly (< 15 %) on the assumed diurnal variations and injection height of the emissions. However, the estimated emissions might depend on unaccounted model uncertainties such as vertical transport. Our emission estimate of 22-27 TgCO during roughly one month of intense burning is less than suggested by another recent study, but substantially larger than predicted by the bottom-up inventories. This latter discrepancy suggests that bottom-up emission estimates for extreme peat burning events require improvements.

AB Current models and theories of the formation and maintenance of microtopography in ombrotrophic peatlands (bogs) assume autogenic feedbacks between vegetation composition, water table depth (WTD) and microtopography. A hypothesized outcome of autogenic feedbacks is a strong association among spatial variations in vegetation composition, WTD and microtopography. We tested and corroborated this hypothesis using fine spatial scale (<2x2m(2)) data from two 20 x 20 m(2) plots at Mer Bleue, a temperate bog. Furthermore, we partitioned the spatial variation of plant communities into portions explained by WTD as well as fine-scale and broad-scale spatial structures using distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps. We hypothesized that plant distributions are more strongly related to WTD than to microtopography and found that this hypothesis was supported in only one of the two sampled plots, suggesting that the feedbacks among WTD, vegetation and microtopography could be dependent on location within a bog. A plot closer to the centre (apex) of the bog showed stronger relationships among WTD-microtopography and vegetation than a plot closer to the margin. Our results support current models and theories of the development of bogs wherein plant communities, water table and microtopography are strongly associated because of underlying ecohydrological feedbacks but highlight that strength and direction of feedbacks may vary by location within a bog. Affirming the presence of these structural relationships and identifying variability in them is a key step towards better understanding peatland carbon cycling, especially in the context of increasing anthropogenic and natural disturbances to peatlands.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays a key role in the peatland carbon balance and serves numerous ecological and chemical functions including acting as a microbial substrate. In this study, we quantify the concentration, biodegradability, and intrinsic properties of DOC obtained from peat, fresh material, and litter from nine species of ombrotrophic bog vegetation. Potential biodegradability was assessed by incubating vegetation extracts for 28 days in the dark and measuring percent DOC loss as the fraction of biodegradable DOC (%BDOC) while DOC properties were characterized using UV-Vis absorbance and fluorescence measurements. The mean initial DOC concentration extracted differed significantly among species (P < 0.05) and was significantly higher in fresh material, 217 +/- 259 mg DOC l(-1), than either litter or peat extracts with mean concentrations of 82.1 +/- 117 mg DOC l(-1) and 12.7 +/- 1.0 mg DOC l(-1), respectively (P < 0.05). %BDOC also differed significantly among species (P < 0.05) and ranged from 52 to 73% in fresh cuttings with the greatest fraction observed in S. magellanicum; 22-46% in litter; and 24% in peat. The majority of variability (82.5%) in BDOC was explained by initial absorbance at 254 nm and total dissolved nitrogen concentration which was further resolved into significant non-linear relationships between %BDOC and both humic-like and protein-like DOC fractions (P < 0.05). Our results highlight the extremely heterogeneous nature of the surface vegetation-derived DOC input in peatlands and stress the importance of vegetation species in peatland ecosystem function.

AB The extent of groundwater-influenced rich fens is increasing across northern regions as permafrost thaws. The increase in the extent of these fens, which store large amounts of carbon in deep organic deposits, is coupled to increases in rainfall and runoff. We examine interannual variations in carbon and water fluxes at a rich fen in interior Alaska that included early (May-June) and mid-late (July-September) dry and wet periods, with early season wet periods coincident with runoff from snowmelt and later season wet periods coincident with inundation from rainfall. From May 2011 to December 2018, the fen was estimated as a 170 +/- 64 g C m(-2)source of CO2. When controlling for soil temperature, net CO(2)uptake was greatest during the early season under dry conditions, with the water table position below the surface, and least during the mid-late season when the water table position was above the surface. Methane emissions were lowest during early season wet periods and greatest during late season wet periods. Our results suggest that it is important to consider the seasonality of wet and dry periods, and how these may potentially be related to runoff from snowmelt versus rainfall in boreal rich fens, when considering the annual net C balance and making accurate projections of carbon balance in northern wetlands.

AB Peatlands store large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). Depending on their present condition, they act as a source or sink of carbon dioxide. Therefore, peatlands are highly relevant for climate change investigations and there is considerable interest to assess spatial heterogeneity of peat soil properties in order to assess the total amount of stored carbon. However, reliable information about peat properties remains difficult to obtain at the field scale. A potential way to acquire this information is the indirect mapping of easily recordable physical variables that correlate with peat properties, such as the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa). In this study, we aim to explore the potential of multi-coil offset electromagnetic induction (EMI) measurements to provide spatial estimates of SOC content, bulk density, and SOC stock for a highly variable and disturbed peatland relict (similar to 35 ha) with a remaining peat layer thickness of less than 1 m. EMI measurements comprised six integral depths that varied from 0-0.25 to 0-1.80 m. In combination with ancillary laser-scanning elevation data, a multiple linear regression model was calibrated to reference data from 34 soil cores that were used to calculate integral properties of the upper 0.25, 0.5, and 1 m layer, as well as for the total peat layer. Leave-one-out cross-validation for the different depth ranges resulted in a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) between 1.36 and 5.16% for SOC content, between 0.108 and 0.183 g cm(-3) for bulk density, and between 3.56 and 9.73 kg m(-2) for SOC stocks, which corresponds to roughly 15%, 10%, and 20% of the total field variability, respectively. The selection of explanatory variables in the regression models showed that the EMI data were important for accurate model predictions, while the topography-based variables mainly acted as noise suppressors. The accuracy of the SOC content estimates roughly equalled the quality of SOC content predictions obtained in previous field applications of the visible-near infrared technique (vis-NIR). The spatial variation of the predicted peat layer properties showed similarities to the former land use distribution. Overall, it was concluded that EMI measurements offer a useful alternative to the established vis-NIR method for SOC content mapping in carbon-rich soils. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Due to the scarcity of reliable and highly resolved moisture proxies covering much of the Holocene, there has been increased interest in the study of living and subfossil peatland trees sensitive to gradual and extreme changes in hydrology, precipitation, and related environmental processes. Peatland development and the associated carbon accumulation, which are strongly influenced by hydrological fluctuations, are also of prime importance as peatlands represent long-term sinks of atmospheric carbon. Improved knowledge of peatland development and soil moisture variability during the Holocene is therefore essential to our understanding of long-term hydroclimate changes, the terrestrial carbon cycle, and to enable more robust predictions of peatland response to future climate changes.
   Here, we review the existing mid- to late Holocene peatland tree-ring chronologies that have been used to study climate variability on (sub-)annual to centennial scales with a primary focus on northern Europe. Since the 1970s, absolutely dated tree-ring chronologies covering substantial parts of the Holocene have been developed from excavated remains of oak (Quercus spp.) and pine (Pinus sylvestris L). The annual tree-ring patterns of these trees are often characterized by periods of depressed growth reflecting annual to decadal hydroclimatic changes. In addition, changes in the spatio-temporal distribution of trees throughout the Holocene are often found to reflect decadal to centennial climate and hydrological changes. Moreover, synchronicity between tree-ring chronologies and tree-population dynamics over larger geographical areas show periods of coherent regional climate forcing, especially during the mid-Holocene.
   This review (i) provides an overview of pioneering and recent studies presenting tree-ring chronologies developed from subfossil peatland trees, and (ii) presents recent developments in the fields of dendroecology (i.e. the response of tree growth and changes in vitality as a result of changes in climatic variables) and dendroclimatology (i.e. the reconstruction of climate fluctuations based on tree-ring analyses) in peatland regions. Moreover, we (iii) use long-term climate reconstructions based on alternative proxies for comparison, and (iv) present different ways to analyse tree-ring records to generate novel information on annual to centennial timescales. This analysis is based on an unprecedented network of tree-ring chronologies from Denmark, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and Canada, as well as a wealth of old and previously (un) published literature from Scandinavia and Germany, which has not been accessible to a wider audience in the past due to inaccessibility or linguistic barriers. Finally, a map of possible hotspots for the assessment of continuous peatlandtree studies is presented, along with suggestions for new research directions in the field. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB There have been widespread attempts to rewet peatlands in Europe and elsewhere in the world to restore their unique biodiversity as well as their important function as nutrient and carbon sinks. However, changes in hydrological regime and therefore oxygen availability likely alter the abundance of enzyme-inhibiting polyphenolic compounds, which have been suggested as a "latch" preventing large amounts of carbon from being released into the atmosphere by microbial mineralization. In recent years, a variety of factors have been identified that appear to weaken that latch including not only oxygen, but also pH. In minerotrophic fens, it is unknown if long-term peat mineralization during decades of drainage and intense agricultural use causes an enrichment or a decline of enzyme-inhibiting polyphenols. To address this, we collected peat samples and fresh roots of dominating plants (i.e., the peat parent material) from the upper 20cm peat layer in 5 rewetted and 6 natural fens and quantified total phenolic content as well as hydrolysable and condensed tannins. Polyphenols from less decomposed peat and living roots served partly as an internal standard for polyphenol analysis and to run enzyme inhibition tests. As hypothesized, we found the polyphenol content in highly decomposed peat to be eight times lower than in less decomposed peat, while condensed tannin content was 50 times lower in highly degraded peat. In addition, plant tissue polyphenol contents differed strongly between peat-forming plant species, with the highest amount found in roots of Carex appropinquata at 450 mg g(-1) dry mass, and lowest in Sphagnum spp. at 39 mg g(-1) dry mass: a 10-fold difference. Despite large and clear differences in peat and porewater chemistry between natural and rewetted sites, enzyme activities determined with Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis and peat degradation were not significantly correlated, indicating no simple linear relationship between polyphenol content and microbial activity. Still, samples with low contents of polyphenols and condensed tannins showed the highest microbial activities as measured with FDA.

AB Peatlands represent one of the largest terrestrial carbon pools. Phenol oxidase is widely considered to play a critical role in the decomposition of organic matter in peatlands, which is known as the "enzymatic latch". However, our recent studies have indicated that the formation of iron-organic matter (Fe-OM) associations is more likely to occur in the presence of laccase, the largest class of phenol oxidases in soils. As the formation of Fe-OM associations is recognized as an important stabilization mechanism for soil organic matter, further clarification of the potential mechanisms contributes to a better understanding of the role of laccase in peatland carbon sequestration. In this study, a series of experiments using different phenolic compounds and peat-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) were performed. The results from liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analyses indicated that laccase catalyzed the polymerization of phenolics and peat-derived DOM by coupling of the C-O bond, the C-C bond and the C-C/C-O bonds. The polymerized products can combine more effectively with Fe to form Fe-OM associations. FTIR spectral analysis indicated that organic matter associated with Fe under laccase catalysis contained more oxygen-containing functional groups but fewer aromatic C]C bonds. Although laccase catalysis can change the chemical structure of organic matter, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses showed minimal influence of laccase on the Fe chemical species in the Fe-OM associations. Thus, we propose that laccase mediated the formation of Fe-OM associations by polymerizing organic matter and by increasing the O/C ratio of organic matter. In addition, laccase can improve the sequestration of organic carbon by increasing the C/Fe molar ratio of the formed Fe-OM associations. This mechanism may provide further insight into the role of laccase in the carbon cycling in peatlands.

AB The results of a theoretical isotope mass balance model are presented for the time dependence of burial and weathering-plus-degassing fluxes within the combined long-term carbon and sulfur cycles. Averaged data for oceanic delta(13)C and delta(34)S were entered for every million years from 270 to 240 Ma (middle Permian to middle Triassic) to study general trends across the Permian-Triassic boundary. Results show a drop in the rate of global organic matter burial during the late Permian and a predominance of low values during the early-to-middle Triassic. This overall decrease with time is ascribed mainly to epochs of conversion of high biomass forests to low biomass herbaceous vegetation resulting in a decrease in the production of terrestrially derived organic debris. Additional contributions to lessened terrestrial carbon burial were increased aridity and a drop in sea level during the late Permian which led to smaller areas of low-lying coastal wetlands suitable for coal and peat deposition.
   Mirroring the drop in organic matter deposition was an increase in the burial of sedimentary pyrite, and a dramatic increase in the calculated global mean ratio of pyrite-S to organic-C. High S/C values resulted from an increase of deposition in marine euxinic basins combined with a decrease in the burial of low-pyrite associated terrestrial organic matter. The prediction of increased oceanic anoxia during the late Permian and early Triassic agrees with independent studies of the composition of sedimentary rocks.
   Weathering plus burial fluxes for organic carbon and pyrite sulfur were used to calculate changes in atmospheric oxygen. The striking result is a continuous drop in O-2 concentration from similar to 30% to similar to 13% over a twenty million year period. This drop was brought about mainly by a decrease in the burial of terrestrially derived organic matter. but with a possible contribution from the weathering of older organic matter on land. It must have exerted a considerable influence on animal evolution because of the role of O-2 in respiration. Some examples are the extinction of many vertebrates, loss of giant insects and amphibians, and the restriction of animals to low elevations. It is concluded that the extinction of plants may have contributed to the extinction of animals. Copyright (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Peat growth in temperate peat-forming wetlands is believed to have been one of the major climate regulation mechanisms throughout the late Phanerozoic era. Since plant life first evolved on land, peat-forming wetlands have been significant terrestrial carbon sinks, which could well explain the variations in atmospheric composition observed in sediment and glacier cores, etc. The results of this process are hard coal, lignite and peat, which have all been formed under the same conditions. Feat growth and decay is believed to be responsible for the more or less regular shifts between glacials and interglacials during the late Cenozoic, offering an alternative to the Milankovitch theory. Glaciations are also believed to transform landscapes into types suitable for peatland initiation and, hence, form a system of feedback mechanisms. Our model shows that in a future perspective, under natural conditions without anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases, e.g. carbon dioxide, the initiation of a new ice age would have been expected in less than 1000 years; taking into account the regulating role of the oceans, With situations like the present, characterized by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, initiation would most probably be delayed in proportion to atmospheric concentrations. With the present levels of CO2 (c. 350 ppm) our model shows that the initiation of a new ice age could already have been delayed in the order of at least 700-1000 years. In the worst scenario, with increasing CO2 emissions and no termination of anthropogenic CO2 release until 2500 A.D., for most cases in our model the initiation would be delayed in the order of at least 10 000 years.

AB Rewetting of long-term drained fens often results in the formation of eutrophic shallow lakes with an average water depth of less than 1 m. This is accompanied by a fast vegetation shift from cultivated grasses via submerged hydrophytes to helophytes. As a result of rapid plant dying and decomposition, these systems are highly dynamic wetlands characterised by a high mobilisation of nutrients and elevated emissions of CO2 and CH4. However, the impact of specific plant species on these phenomena is not clear. Therefore we investigated the CO2 and CH4 production due to the subaqueous decomposition of shoot biomass of five selected plant species which represent different rewetting stages (Phalaris arundinacea, Ceratophyllum demersum, Typha latifolia, Phragmites australis and Carex riparia) during a 154 day mesocosm study. Beside continuous gas flux measurements, we performed bulk chemical analysis of plant tissue, including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and plant polymer dynamics. Plant-specific mass losses after 154 days ranged from 25 % (P. australis) to 64% (C. demersum). Substantial differences were found for the CH4 production with highest values from decomposing C. demersum (0.4 g CH4 kg(-1) dry mass day) that were about 70 times higher than CH4 production from C. riparia. Thus, we found a strong divergence between mass loss of the litter and methane production during decomposition. If C. demersum as a hydrophyte is included in the statistical analysis solely nutrient contents (nitrogen and phosphorus) explain varying greenhouse gas production of the different plant species while lignin and polyphenols demonstrate no significant impact at all. Taking data of annual biomass production as important carbon source for methanogens into account, high CH4 emissions can be expected to last several decades as long as inundated and nutrient-rich conditions prevail. Different restoration measures like water level control, biomass extraction and top soil removal are discussed in the context of mitigation of CH4 emissions from rewetted fens.

AB We revisited the well documented and ongoing long-term 'Ultuna continuous soil organic matter field experiment' which started in 1956 at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. The objective of the experiment is to quantify effects of six organic amendments and mineral N fertilizers on the crop and soil. We used the 'equivalent soil mass' concept for estimating changes in the topsoil carbon stocks in all 15 treatments. C inputs from amendments were measured and those from crops were calculated using allometric functions and crop yields. Clustering C inputs into seven categories by quality allowed us to calculate a 'humification' coefficient for each category. Here, these coefficients were simply based on the fraction of total C input that still remains in the topsoil after about 50 years. As indicated by previous studies, this coefficient was highest for peat, followed by sewage sludge, manure, sawdust and above-ground crop residues. The most interesting result from the current investigation is that the optimized coefficient for root-derived carbon was about 2.3 times higher than that for above-ground plant residues. The calculated results were found to be robust in a sensitivity analysis. Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that root-derived carbon contributes more to relatively stable soil C pools than the same amount of above-crop residue-derived (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide was measured at treeline forest and fen tundra sites near Churchill, Canada during three consecutive growing seasons (1997-1999). Although both sites demonstrated a net uptake of CO2 in each of the years, there was considerable variation in the flux between sites and between years. Mean daily NEE at the forest varied from -1.5 (+/-0.25 SD) g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in 1997 to -7.3 (+/-0.39) g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in 1999. The fen mean daily NEE varied from -1.1 (+/-0.36) g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in 1997 to -3.1 (+/-0.50) g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in 1998. Integrated over the 65-d measurement period the forest was a net sink of -100, -313, and -478 g CO2 m(-2) in 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively, and the fen net sink was -73, -202, and -38 g CO2 m(-2), respectively. Interannual variations in the fen NEE were closely related to water table draw-down (soil wetness), the forest NEE was unaffected by water table change. The forest seasonally cumulative NEE was closely associated with timing of snowmelt and accumulated heat content prior to leaf-out. Earlier snowmelt and greater heat accumulation produced a larger growing season sink. It is likely these events also influenced the fen NEE, but the relationship is complicated by water table effects. These results suggest that carbon dioxide exchange varies considerably across the northern treeline, and that there may be an important biospheric feedback between climate warming, treeline advance, and carbon cycling.

AB Shallow fresh water bodies in peat areas are important contributors to greenhouse gas fluxes to the atmosphere. In this study we determined the magnitude of CH4 and CO2 fluxes from 12 water bodies in Dutch wetlands during the summer season and studied the factors that might regulate emissions of CH4 and CO2 from these lakes and ditches. The lakes and ditches acted as CO2 and CH4 sources of emissions to the atmosphere; the fluxes from the ditches were significantly larger than the fluxes from the lakes. The mean greenhouse gas flux from ditches and lakes amounted to 129.1 +/- A 8.2 (mean +/- A SE) and 61.5 +/- A 7.1 mg m(-2) h(-1) for CO2 and 33.7 +/- A 9.3 and 3.9 +/- A 1.6 mg m(-2) h(-1) for CH4, respectively. In most water bodies CH4 was the dominant greenhouse gas in terms of warming potential. Trophic status of the water and the sediment was an important factor regulating emissions. By using multiple linear regression 87% of the variation in CH4 could be explained by PO4 (3-) concentration in the sediment and Fe2+ concentration in the water, and 89% of the CO2 flux could be explained by depth, EC and pH of the water. Decreasing the nutrient loads and input of organic substrates to ditches and lakes by for example reducing application of fertilizers and manure within the catchments and decreasing upward seepage of nutrient rich water from the surrounding area will likely reduce summer emissions of CO2 and CH4 from these water bodies.

AB Net ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of CO2 (NEE) was measured in two boreal bogs during the snow-free periods of 1998, 1999 and 2000. The two sites were located in European Russia (Fyodorovskoye), and in central Siberia (Zotino). Climate at both sites was generally continental but with more extreme summer-winter gradients in temperature at the more eastern site Zotino. The snow-free period in Fyodorovskoye exceeded the snow-free period at Zotino by several weeks. Marked seasonal and interannual differences in NEE were observed at both locations, with contrasting rates and patterns. Amongst the most important contrasts were: (1) Ecosystem respiration at a reference soil temperature was higher at Fyodorovskoye than at Zotino. (2) The diurnal amplitude of summer NEE was larger at Fyodorovskoye than at Zotino. (3) There was a modest tendency for maximum 24 h NEE during average rainfall years to be more negative at Zotino (-0.17 versus -0.15 mol m(-2) d(-1)), suggesting a higher productivity during the summer months. (4) Cumulative net uptake of CO2 during the snow-free period was strongly related to climatic differences between years. In Zotino the interannual variability in climate, and also in the CO2 balance during the snow-free period, was small. However, at Fyodorovskoye the bog was a significant carbon sink in one season and a substantial source for CO2-C in the next, which was below-average dry. Total snow-free uptake and annual estimates of net CO2-C uptake are discussed, including associated uncertainties.

AB We measured methane emissions over a two-year period (2006-08) from two 12 to 14-year-old created freshwater marshes in central Ohio, one initially planted and the other allowed to self-colonize. Overall, methane emissions in the two created wetlands were different (p < 0.05), with the plant self-colonized wetland having higher annual methane (median and mean) emissions of 19 and 68 g CH4-C m(-2) y(-1) than the planted wetland (6 and 17 g CH4-C m(-2) y(-1)). Since hydrology and soil/water temperature were identical for the two wetlands, we hypothesize that differences in carbon accumulation due to higher net primary productivity in the self-colonized wetland may be causing higher methane emissions in that wetland. Net primary productivity in the self-colonized wetland was higher 7 out of 11 years prior to the study. Methane emissions from the created wetlands were lower than the average methane emission of 82 g CH4-C m(-2) y(-1) in a natural wetland in Ohio with similar hydrologic patterns. Methane emissions increased at a slower rate in the planted wetland (4 g CH4-C m(-2) y(-1)) than in the self-colonized wetland (16 g CH4-C m(-2) y(-1)) over a four-year period. Early methane emissions from created wetlands may depend as much or more on the methods used to create the wetlands, e.g. planting v. self colonization, as on their hydrogeomorphic conditions.

AB Ultraviolet (UV) spectra were measured to characterize the dissolved and particulate organic matter in a bog and to investigate the seasonal fluctuation of this organic matter. The optical density spectra in the UV region of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were proportional to lambda(-4) where lambda is the wavelength of incident light. There was also small absorption on the lambda(-4) spectra. The optical density at a wavelength of 280 nm was proportional to the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOG). The spectra and the dependency of optical density on DOC did not vary throughout the investigation period. The UV spectra of acid extractions of particulate organic matter (POM) showed two absorption peaks at the wavelengths of 220 nm and 335 nm. These peaks are well represented by the sum of two Lorentz functions. The ratio of the absorbances, A(280)/A(335), was dependent on the nitrogen/carbon ratio of POM and the chlorophyll fraction in particulate organic carbon (POC), and not dependent on POC itself. The dependency of POC absorption at 280 nm varied with this ratio which fluctuated seasonally.

AB A significant challenge in the prediction of climate change impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity is quantifying the sources of uncertainty that emerge within and between different models. Statistical species niche models have grown in popularity, yet no single best technique has been identified reflecting differing performance in different situations. Our aim was to quantify uncertainties associated with the application of 2 complimentary modelling techniques. Generalised linear mixed models (GLMM) and generalised additive mixed models (GAMM) were used to model the realised niche of ombrotrophic Sphagnum species in British peatlands. These models were then used to predict changes in Sphagnum cover between 2020 and 2050 based on projections of climate change and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulphur. Over 90% of the variation in the GLMM predictions was due to niche model parameter uncertainty, dropping to 14% for the GAMM. After having covaried out other factors, average variation in predicted values of Sphagnum cover across UK peatlands was the next largest source of variation (8% for the GLMM and 86% for the GAMM). The better performance of the GAMM needs to be weighed against its tendency to overfit the training data. While our niche models are only a first approximation, we used them to undertake a preliminary evaluation of the relative importance of climate change and nitrogen and sulphur deposition and the geographic locations of the largest expected changes in Sphagnum cover. Predicted changes in cover were all small (generally <1% in an average 4 m(2) unit area) but also highly uncertain. Peatlands expected to be most affected by climate change in combination with atmospheric pollution were Dartmoor, Brecon Beacons and the western Lake District.

AB Evapotranspiration rates (ET) from contrasting Wisconsin bogs (one forested bog, one open bog) were compared over 4 years by analyzing diel oscillations of their water tables. Daily rates of ET from peatlands were also compared to rates of evaporation (E) from encircled bog ponds. We hypothesized that ET would be higher in the forested bog due to the greater leaf area index of forest canopy relative to moss and ericaceous shrubs. We also hypothesized that ET in peatlands would exceed the physical process of E from encircled ponds. Field data supported the first hypothesis, but the second only proved true for the forested peatland. Daily estimates of peatland ET varied widely, ranging from similar to 1 to > 10 mm/d; but average ET was higher in the forested peatland (4.04 vs. 3.09 mm/d; p < .01). Average ET in the forested peatland was also higher than E during summer (4.04 vs. 3.31 mm/d; p <.05); whereas in the open peatland, average ET was slightly lower than E for all measured seasons (p <.01). Methodologically, the performance of three equations used to estimate ET from daily water table fluctuations was similar. The specific yield of peat (S*y), which is a critical variable in all three equations, was found to be an exponential function of water table depth; and absent an empirically derived S*y, errors in estimates of peatland ET can be large. Given landscape composition across this northern temperate region (13% lakes, 20% peatland, and 54% upland forest) and estimates of forest ET gleaned from the literature, our findings suggest that the regional feedback of water to the atmosphere increases from open waters to peatlands to upland forest, consistent with prior observations that the biological process of transpiration dominates continental ET.

AB Northern peatlands in permafrost regions contain a large amount of organic carbon (C) in the soil. Climate warming and associated permafrost degradation are expected to have significant impacts on the C balance of these ecosystems, but the magnitude is uncertain. We incorporated a permafrost model, Northern Ecosystem Soil Temperature (NEST), into a biogeochemical model, DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC), to model C dynamics in high-latitude peatland ecosystems. The enhanced model was applied to assess effects of permafrost thaw on C fluxes of a subarctic peatland at Stordalen, Sweden. DNDC simulated soil freeze-thaw dynamics, net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), and CH4 fluxes across three typical land cover types, which represent a gradient in the process of ongoing permafrost thaw at Stordalen. Model results were compared with multiyear field measurements, and the validation indicates that DNDC was able to simulate observed differences in seasonal soil thaw, NEE, and CH4 fluxes across the three land cover types. Consistent with the results from field studies, the modeled C fluxes across the permafrost thaw gradient demonstrate that permafrost thaw and the associated changes in soil hydrology and vegetation not only increase net uptake of C from the atmosphere but also increase the annual to decadal radiative forcing impacts on climate due to increased CH4 emissions. This study indicates the potential of utilizing biogeochemical models, such as DNDC, to predict the soil thermal regime in permafrost areas and to investigate impacts of permafrost thaw on ecosystem C fluxes after incorporating a permafrost component into the model framework.

AB Surface and ground water was sampled in a degraded bog area 36 times during 1993-2003 at Five representative points: point E (natural area with Sphagnum as the main vegetal cover), point W (boundary between the natural and degraded areas), point W' (area installed with vinyl sheeting), point WW (area where Sasa thrives), and point NC (area with naturally formed ditches). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted for parameters measured in surface water and ground water at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m depths. "Sampling point" (i.e. locations along the degradation gradient) accounted for most of the variation in surface and ground water chemistry. It accounted for 30-80% of the total variation in pH, electrical conductivity, ammonia, dissolved nitrogen, major cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+), alkalinity and dissolved organic carbon. "Year" accounted for more variation in nitrate, nitrite, chloride, and sulfate than the sampling point did, but the variation in dissolved reactive phosphorus and dissolved phosphorus concentrations was not based on any of the calculated variables.

ID LITTER DECOMPOSITION
AB Purpose The standardized 'Tea Bag Index' enables comparisons of litter decomposition rates, a key component of carbon cycling, across ecosystems. However, tea 'litter' may leach more than other plant litter, skewing comparisons of decomposition rates between sites with differing moisture conditions. Therefore, some researchers leach tea bags before field incubation. This decreases comparability between studies, and it is unclear if this modification is necessary. Methods We submerged green and rooibos tea bags in water, and measured their leaching losses over time (2 min - 72 h). We also compared leaching of tea to leaf and root litter from other plant species, and finally, compared mass loss of pre-leached and standard tea bags in a fully factorial incubation experiment differing in soil moisture (wet and dry) and soil types (sand and peat). Results Both green and rooibos tea leached strongly, levelling-off at about 40% and 20% mass loss, respectively. Mass loss from leaching was highest in green tea followed by leaves of other plants, then rooibos tea, and finally roots of other plants. When incubated for 4 weeks, both teas showed lower mass loss when they had been pre-leached compared to standard tea bags. However, these differences between standard and pre-leached tea bags were similar in moist vs. dry soils, both in peat and in sand. Conclusions Thus, despite large leaching losses, we conclude that leaching tea bags before field or lab incubation is not necessary to compare decomposition rates between systems, ranging from as much as 5% to 25% soil moisture.

AB Hydrothermal processes are key components of permafrost dynamics and hydrological and carbon cycles in northern forest ecosystems. A forest hydrology model. ForHyM, was used to evaluate these processes by determining how the depth and duration of frost penetration into the soil would vary daily over the course of several decades. This was done for chosen upland/wetland conditions within the Mackenzie Plain south of Fort Simpson, where permafrost is currently sporadic to discontinuous. The model calculations were done using daily weather records from November 1963 to 2010, starting with a hypothetical no-frost condition within the soil and subsoil. Model performance was evaluated by comparing modeled and measured temperatures at different soil depths (upland and peat plateau modelling, R-2 = 0.95 and 0.94, respectively). It was found that well-drained upland forests within the general area would experience deep and complete freeze thaw cycles each year. In contrast, poorly drained wetlands would develop gradually deepening permafrost that would at first stabilize in depth over the course of 10 to 20 y, with thaw depth limited to <1 m each year. However, recent increases in recorded air temperature (more so in winter than in summer) would destabilize the pennafrost layer, and this would especially occur in areas with insufficient surface insulation by local peat, moss, forest litter, and snow accumulations. These estimates are consistent with (i) reported thawing depths and the widening encroachment of collapse scars towards the poorly drained portions of the South Mackenzie Plain.

AB Sedimentary sequences obtained from drilling during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 320/321, "Pacific Equatorial Age Tran sect (PEAT)" at eight sites (Sites U1331-1338) in the equatorial Pacific offer an ideal record for reconstructing the evolution of the ocean/climate system throughout the Cenozoic. The sediments drilled at Site U1335 record short-term events of paleoceanographic significance, including the early Miocene climatic optimum (MCO) and the middle Miocene climatic transition (MMCT). Abundant well preserved radiolarians were recovered from the lower Miocene radiolarian Zone RN2 through middle Miocene Zone RN5 at IODP Site U1335. A total of 46 radiolarian datum levels consisting of 20 first occurrences (FOs), 25 last occurrences (LOs), and one evolutionary transition (ET) was recognized within the studied interval at Site U1335. Of these datum levels, 36 radiolarian datum levels were directly tied to the geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS) across the early/middle Miocene boundary. The general magnitude of evolutionary change was estimated based on the total turnover rate (the sum of FOs and LOs per 0.5 m.y.) of tropical radiolarians, and two minor faunal turnovers of radiolarian species were recognized between 16.5 and 14.7 Ma and between 13.9 and 13.4 Ma. These faunal turnovers were associated with regional environmental changes such as the increased biological productivity in the equatorial Pacific during the MCO and the MMCT.

AB QuestionMeasurements of ecosystem carbon (C) exchange are usually labour-intensive and expensive. In peatlands, these temporally and spatially limited measurements are often up-scaled over comparable ecosystems, such as ombrotrophic bogs, to provide an estimate for ecosystem level carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes. Peatlands typically have moisture variations reflected in the presence of microforms (e.g. hummocks and hollows), each with characteristic plant life forms. However, so far the applicability of peatland type (e.g. bog, fen) or microforms for up-scaling has not been assessed. Does the vegetation composition or function of associated species differ so greatly between the same types of peatland that up-scaling is impossible?
   LocationFive ombrotrophic bogs in Northern Europe; in Ireland, Finland and western Russia.
   MethodsWe described the variation in vegetation of microforms within and between ombrotrophic bogs using multivariate analyses. Thereafter, we measured CO2 exchange at different microforms and evaluated the relationship between vegetation structure and the light response of photosynthesis.
   ResultsOur results show that the community composition of hummocks, lawns and hollows was rather uniform at the plant life-form level. The photosynthetic capacity per leaf area unit was quite similar within microform classes over the different bogs. The observed differences between sites in capacity were mainly related to variation in leaf area.
   ConclusionsA reliable estimate of ecosystem-level photosynthesis requires knowledge of the proportion of different microforms in an area and the leaf area characteristics for each microform in the year(s) in question. Assessments of ecosystem-level photosynthesis are important with regard to current and future changes in climate, as the most dramatic changes in peatlands involve water level drawdown, which in turn is likely to lead to changes in the relative proportions of microforms within peatlands.

AB Reed canary grass (RCG, Phalaris arundinacea L.) is a suitable energy crop for cultivation in northern peatlands. However, the atmospheric impact of RCG cultivation as influenced by harvest frequency and fertilization is not clear. Here, we compared the biomass yield and greenhouse gas (GHG) balance for RCG cultivation in peatlands affected by cutting frequency and fertilizer managements. The managements included one-cut (OC) and two-cut (TC) systems that were either fertilized (TC-F) or unfertilized (TC-U) after the first cut in summer. Biomass yield of OC, TC-F and TC-U were 12, 16 and 11 Mg dry biomass per hectare per year, respectively. GHG fluxes of CO2, N2O and CH4 were measured with closed chamber techniques in the period between first and second (final) harvest of the TC managements, i.e. from 15 June to 23 September 2011. In the GHG monitoring period of 100 days, all systems were net sources of CO2 corresponding to 64 +/- 3, 217 +/- 15 and 50 +/- 23 g CO2-C m(-2) (mean +/- standard error, n = 3) from the OC, TC-F and TC-U systems, respectively. In the same period, emissions of N2O from TC-F were ten times higher as compared to OC and TC-U. Emissions of CH4 were negligible from all systems. The TC systems could not improve the GHG balance during cultivation (271, 663 and 210 g CO(2)e-C m(-2) emissions from the OC, TC-F and TC-U systems, respectively), but in a broader GHG life cycle perspective, the increased biomass yield by TC-F could replace more fossil fuel and offset at least some of the higher emissions from the system.

AB Common reed (Phragmites australis) is dominant vegetation of temperate coastal wetlands in northeast China. To studying the link between ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and its influential factors, a multi-year in-situ experiment was carried out in a newly restored wetland during the growing seasons of 2012 to 2014. Total in-situ R-eco was separated into soil microbial and belowground root respiration (Rs + r) and plant respiration (R-plant). The soil microbial respiration rate (R-s) was isolated from Rs + r, making it easier to understand each component of R-eco. With the wetland restoration process, the seasonal average aboveground biomass (dry mass) increased from 411.5 g m(-2) to 2048.1 g m(-2) and the corresponding R-eco increased from 751.78 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) to 2612.41 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1).R-plant contributed averagely 69% similar to 71% to R-eco on the whole seasonal scale and the plant activity was strongly seasonal. With 1 g of aboveground common reed biomass (dry weight), approximately 3.6 mg CO2 would be produced per hour during the sprouting period while it could be as low as 0.3 mg CO2 during plant senescence period. Inundation regime dominated the contribution of R-s to R-eco and the flooded contribution would lower the R-s contribution to as low as 11%.

AB Extreme hydrological events are known to contribute significantly to total annual carbon export, the largest of which in Arctic and boreal catchments is spring snowmelt. Whilst previous work has quantified the export of carbon during snowmelt, the source of the carbon remains unclear. Here we use cation hydrochemistry to trace the primary flowpaths which govern the export of carbon during the snowmelt period; specifically we aim to examine the importance of snowpack meltwater to catchment carbon export. The study was carried out in two forested peatland (drained and undrained) catchments in Eastern Finland. Both catchments were characterised by base-poor stream water chemistry, with cation concentrations generally decreasing in response to increasing discharge. Streamflow during the snowmelt period was best described as a mixture of three sources: pre-event water, snowpack meltwater and a third dilute component we attribute to the upper snow layer which was chemically similar to recent precipitation. Over the study period, pre-event water contributed 32% and 43% of the total stream runoff in Valipuro (undrained) and Suopuro (drained), respectively. The results also suggest a greater near-surface throughflow component in Suopuro, the drained catchment, prior to snowmelt. CO2 and DOC concentrations correlated positively with cation concentrations in both catchments indicating a common, peat/groundwater flowpath. CH4 concentrations were significantly higher in the drained catchment and appeared to be transported in near-surface throughflow. Meltwater from the snowpack represented an important source of stream water CO2 in both catchments, contributing up to 49% of total downstream CO2 export during the study period. We conclude that the snowpack represents a potentially important, and often overlooked, transient carbon store in boreal snow-covered catchments. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The majority of peatlands in the temperate zone is subjected to drainage and agricultural land use and have been found to be anthropogenic emission hot spots for greenhouse gases. At the same time, many peatlands receive increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition by intensive agricultural practices. Here we provide eddy covariance measurements determining net ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange at a protected but moderately drained ombrotrophic bog in Northwestern Germany over three consecutive years. The region is dominated by intensive agricultural land use with total (wet and dry) atmospheric N deposition being about 25kgNha(-1)yr(-1). The investigated peat bog was a small net CO2 sink during all three years ranging from -9 to -73gCm(-2)yr(-1). We found temperature- and light-dependent ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross primary production, respectively, but only weak correlations to water table depths despite large interannual and seasonal variability. Significant short-term effects of atmospheric N deposition on CO2 flux components could not be observed, as the primary controlling factors for N deposition and C sequestration, i.e., fertilization of adjacent fields as well as temperature and light availability, respectively, exceeded potential interactions between the two.

AB Climate warming in high-latitude regions is thawing carbon-rich permafrost soils, which can release carbon to the atmosphere and enhance climate warming. Using a coupled model of long-term peatland dynamics (Holocene Peat Model, HPM-Arctic), we quantify the potential loss of carbon with future climate warming for six sites with differing climates and permafrost histories in Northwestern Canada. We compared the net carbon balance at 2100 CE resulting from new productivity and the decomposition of active layer and newly thawed permafrost peats under RCP8.5 as a high-end constraint. Modeled net carbon losses ranged from -3.0 kg C m(-2) (net loss) to +0.1 kg C m(-2) (net gain) between 2015 and 2100. Losses of newly thawed permafrost peat comprised 0.2%-25% (median: 1.6%) of "old" C loss, which were related to the residence time of peat in the active layer before being incorporated into the permafrost, peat temperature, and presence of permafrost. The largest C loss was from the permafrost-free site, not from permafrost sites. C losses were greatest from depths of 0.2-1.0 m. New C added to the profile through net primary productivity between 2015 and 2100 offset similar to 40% to >100% of old C losses across the sites. Differences between modeled active layer deepening and flooding following permafrost thaw resulted in very small differences in net C loss by 2100, illustrating the important role of present-day conditions and permafrost aggradation history in controlling net C loss.

AB Northern peatlands have accumulated one third of the Earth's soil carbon stock since the last Ice Age. Rapid warming across northern biomes threatens to accelerate rates of peatland ecosystem respiration. Despite compensatory increases in net primary production, greater ecosystem respiration could signal the release of ancient, century- to millennia-old carbon from the peatland organic matter stock. Warming has already been shown to promote ancient peatland carbon release, but, despite the key role of vegetation in carbon dynamics, little is known about how plants influence the source of peatland ecosystem respiration. Here, we address this issue using insitu(14)C measurements of ecosystem respiration on an established peatland warming and vegetation manipulation experiment. Results show that warming of approximately 1 degrees C promotes respiration of ancient peatland carbon (up to 2100years old) when dwarf-shrubs or graminoids are present, an effect not observed when only bryophytes are present. We demonstrate that warming likely promotes ancient peatland carbon release via its control over organic inputs from vascular plants. Our findings suggest that dwarf-shrubs and graminoids prime microbial decomposition of previously locked-up' organic matter from potentially deep in the peat profile, facilitating liberation of ancient carbon as CO2. Furthermore, such plant-induced peat respiration could contribute up to 40% of ecosystem CO2 emissions. If consistent across other subarctic and arctic ecosystems, this represents a considerable fraction of ecosystem respiration that is currently not acknowledged by global carbon cycle models. Ultimately, greater contribution of ancient carbon to ecosystem respiration may signal the loss of a previously stable peatland carbon pool, creating potential feedbacks to future climate change.

AB Greenhouse gas fluxes in a wettand ecosystem may be dramatically modified by human activities or vegetation change. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Sasa invasion on Global Warming Potential (GWP) in Sphagnum-dominated poor fen at Bibai, central Hokkaido, Japan. Fluxes Of CO2, CH4, and N2O at Sphagnum-dominated site (Sp) and Sasa invasion site (Sa) were measured by a closed chamber method, using a rectangular transparent acryl chamber, 30 cm x 30 cm x 60 cm (length x width x height), to cover whole plant bodies during the measurement. CO2 flux measured by this method gives an estimate of the net ecosystem exchange (NEE), also known as net CO2 exchange. Respiration rate was measured by using a shaded chamber. GWP was calculated using a 100-year time horizon recommended by IPCC (factors of 21 for CH4 and 310 for N2O).
   NEE was significantly higher (p < 0.05) at Sa (223.8 g C m(-2) y(-1)) than at Sp (5.8 g C m(-2) y-1). CH4 emission was higher at Sp (13.2 g C m(-2) y(-1)) than at Sa (6.6 g C m(-2) y(-1)), although the difference between the two sites is not significant. The contribution of CH4 emission during the snow period (from snow cover to snow melting) to the total annual CH4 emission accounted for 12% at Sp and 10% at Sa. N2O emissions were 0.032 and 0.005 g N m(-2) y(-1) at Sp and Sa, respectively. The estimated GWP was significantly higher (p < 0.05) at Sa (1009 9 CO2 m(-2) y(-1)) than at Sp (408 9 CO2 m(-2) y(-1)) and the contribution of CO2 emission to GWP was greater at Sa (81%) than at Sp (5%). Thus, we conclude that Saso invasion in Sphagnum-dominated poor fen contributes to global warming due to increased CO2 emission.

AB To elucidate the roles of hydrology and vegetation in belowground carbon cycling within peatlands, radiocarbon values were obtained for pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CH4, and peat from the Glacial Lake Agassiz peatland. The major implication of this work is that the rate of microbial respiration within a peat column is greater than the peat decomposition rate. The radiocarbon content of DOC at both bog and fen was enriched relative to solid-phase peat by similar to 150-300 parts per thousand consistent with the advection of recently photosynthesized DOC downward into the peat column. Fen Delta C-14 values for DIC and CH4 closely track the Delta C-14 of pore water DOC at depth, indicating that this recent plant production was the predominant substrate for microbial respiration. Aceticlastic methanogenesis apparently dominated the upper third of the peat column (alpha = 1.05), shifting toward CO2 reduction with depth (1.05 < <alpha> < 1.08). Upwelling groundwater contributed as much as 15% of the DIC to the bulk DIC pool at depth in the fen. The similarity of <Delta>C-14 values for DIC and CH4 suggests that methanogens utilized DIC from this source as well as DIC produced in situ. Bog Delta C-14 values for pore water DIC and CH4 differ by less than or equal to 15 parts per thousand at all depths and are depleted in C-14 relative to DOC by similar to 100 parts per thousand, suggesting microbial utilization of a mixture of older and modern substrate. CO2 reduction was the primary pathway for methanogenesis at all depths in the bog (a = 1.08), and groundwater influence on bulk DIC was negligible. For bath sites, Delta C-14-DIC and Delta C-14-CH4 are approximately equal at depths where stable isotope data indicate a predominance of CO2 reduction and dissimilar when acetate fermentation is indicated.

AB Carbon emissions from fluvial systems are a key component of local and regional carbon cycles. We used floating chambers to investigate the CO2 flux from stream water to air () in the Arboleda, a stream in the lowland rainforest of Costa Rica, fed partly by old regional groundwater high in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Drifting and static chambers showed averaging 35.5 and 72.7 mu mol C m(-2) s(-1), respectively, bracketing the previously-published value of 56 mu mol C m(-2) s(-1) obtained using tracer methods in this stream. These values are much higher than most data in the literature and reflect a large flux of deep crustal (non-biogenic) CO2 out of the Arboleda, a flux that does not represent a component of ecosystem respiration. Static chambers appeared to overestimate by creating artificial turbulence, while drifting chambers may have underestimated by under-sampling areas of potentially high gas exchange (e.g., riffles around coarse woody debris obstructions). Both static and drifting chambers revealed high spatial heterogeneity in at the scale of 5-30 m reaches. Some observed temporal trends were localized, e.g., among three reaches with repeated measurements through the wet and dry seasons, (1) only the reach located between the other two showed significantly lower during the dry season, and (2) the highest and lowest were consistently observed in the reaches farthest upstream and downstream, respectively. Streams like the Arboleda receiving significant inputs of high-DIC regional groundwater merit additional study as hotspots for C emissions from terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Palaeoecological studies (including analysis of pollen, macrofossils, geochemistry, and AMS radiocarbon dates) of four peat sections from one low-centred ice-wedge polygon in NE Yakutia (NE Siberia) allow the three-dimensional reconstruction of polygon development during the last ca 1250 years. After drainage of a lake, peat forming vegetation invaded rapidly. Comparison with palaeotemperature data shows that the initial formation of mature ridges coincided with a period of high summer temperatures around AD 1400. The ridges persisted and expanded during the subsequent colder ca 200 years. Partial collapse of various ridges at the end of the 18th century corresponded to a phase with low summer temperatures. During the warm, 20th century one collapsed ridge regenerated, whereas another persisted in its collapsed state. Ice-wedge polygons are, thus, complex and highly dynamic ecosystems, in which changes in temperature and precipitation may induce rapid ecological changes by the complex interplay of water, ice and vegetation. Our study indicates that global warming associated with a decrease in summer precipitation may initially result in enhanced polygon ridge formation. The combination of longer summers and increased winter precipitation, as predicted for high latitudes will, however, eventually result in larger meltwater input in the polygon mires, which may cause the (partial) collapse of polygon ridges and underlying ice-wedges.

AB [1] We used available field survey and literature data to produce inventory maps of wetland biomass and net primary production (NPP) for western Siberia. Field survey data were obtained for major types of wetland microlandscapes within the boreal (taiga) region. We developed a multiscale approach based on using a regional wetland typology map (1:2,500,000 scale), further refined by satellite image classifications (LANDSAT-7, SPOT, RESURS, 1:200,000 scale). Satellite images on test areas designated in the boreal region of western Siberia were classified by 30 landscape classes. We used aerial photography (1:25,000 scale) to evaluate the fraction of the area occupied by microlandscape elements within patterned wetlands. As a result, we were able to produce a GIS map-based inventory of ecosystem phytomass and NPP in west Siberian wetlands. Using the GIS map, the average and total net primary production and biomass were estimated by ecosystem type, the number of vegetation layers, and climatic gradient. The annual NPP to live biomass ratio increases southward from 0.27 in the tundra to 0.65 in the steppe region. Live biomass of wetlands amounts to only 10-30% of the average biomass of upland forests in the same climatic region, although wetland NPP was found to be equal or higher then that of upland forests. Mosses and the belowground fraction of grasses are the major contributors to NPP. Average live biomass and NPP in wetlands were estimated to be 1600 g/m(2) and 790 g/m(2)/yr, respectively. Total wetland NPP amounts to 530 Tg/yr, and live biomass amounts to 1070 Tg.

AB Peat accumulation makes nutrient-limited ombrotrophic bogs important carbon sinks, while enhanced atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition threatens this capacity. Here we show that the stoichiometry of peat and porewater, a control of plant growth and decomposition, has been altered in response to long-term N, phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilization at Mer Bleue ombrotrophic bog in eastern Ontario, Canada. In N fertilized peat, receiving up to an additional 6.4 g N m(-2) y(-1) above ambient deposition, we found N significantly (p < 0.05) greater, P both significantly greater and smaller dependent on treatment concentration, calcium (Ca) and K concentrations significantly lower, relative to control plots. In NPK-fertilized peat, P was greater than control while Ca was significantly smaller. In the porewater of N- and NPK-fertilized peat, we observed significantly more ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen, phosphate, and dissolved organic phosphorus than in the controls. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis demonstrated that fertilization in all treatments increased decomposition, as indicated by residual enrichment of refractory moieties such as aromatics, carboxylates, and lignin, albeit only in the uppermost depths. Changes in peat quality may, however, not only relate to advanced decomposition but also to changes in litter input, as predominant vascular vegetation in the fertilized plots shared several features in FTIR spectra with samples of uppermost peat layers. Our results demonstrate that the peat in this ombrotrophic bog has responded to long-term fertilization with loss of Sphagnum moss and its filter function, increased shrub cover and enhanced decomposition.

AB Methane (CH4) fluxes were measured by a static chamber technique from May to October 1991 at 19 wetland sites near Cochrane, northern Ontario, representative of the Clay Belt Midboreal region of central Canada. Seasonal average fluxes of CH4 from the peatlands ranged from 0.4 to 67.5 mg.m-2.d-1 (0.06-10.1 g.m-2.yr-1). Beaver ponds showed the highest fluxes of CH4, from both the open water section (seasonal average 290 mg.m-2.d-1, 44 g.m-2.yr-1) and the adjacent marsh areas where the water table rose close to or above the soil surface (91-350 mg.m-2.d-1, 13-53 g.m-2.yr-1).
   Seasonal mean water table position, particularly at the microtopographic scale of hummock and hollow, explained most of the variability in CH4 emission among wetlands (r2 = 0.74). Trophic status, such as pore-water Ca, Mg, and pH had little correlation with CH4 emissions. Broad-scale peatland classifications that do not account for hydrological differences at the microtopographic level are inadequate for predicting CH4 flux in boreal wetlands, particularly in forested ecosystems where conifer swamps are diverse and comprise the major peatland class. Based on areal estimates of the different wetland types in the Clay Belt, we estimate an annual CH4 flux of 3.4 g.m-2.yr-1, generally lower than that used in extrapolations to continental- or global-scale methane budgets.

AB Peatlands play a significant role in global carbon (C) cycles. Through incubation experiments of peat samples selected in the discontinuous permafrost zone of the Great Hing'an Mountains, we studied the effects of temperature and moisture on potential CO2 emission. Rates of C mineralization decreased with soil depth, increased with temperature, and reached the highest rates at 60% WHC (water holding capacity) at the same temperature. Total C mineralization ranged from 10.3 to 95.0 mg under the treatments for 40 d incubation and was significantly affected by soil temperature and moisture (P < 0.001). Calculated Q (10) values ranged from 2.1 to 2.7, and the average values could be used for multiple regression functions. We successfully predicted C mineralization as a function of incubation time, temperature, and moisture (P < 0.001) and estimated the peat C mineralization under future climate scenarios. The results indicated that C mineralization of peatlands would be accelerated under warming temperature. The peatlands in our study area would be a potential CO2 source to the atmosphere with future climatic changes.

AB Fire, including prescribed burning, is common on peatlands globally and can affect vegetation, including peat-forming Sphagnum mosses, and affect ecosystem services. We monitored vegetation in different burn-age categories at three UK peatland sites over a 19-month period. Half of the plots had Sphagnum fragments added and their survival was assessed. Changes in vegetation composition over time, and associations between vegetation composition, site and burn-age category were investigated. Plots in the most recently burned category were likely to have more bare peat, a thinner moss layer and lower vascular plant strata. Graminoid cover initially increased after burning but was low after 10+ years. Dwarf shrub cover increased after burning and remained high after 10+ years. At the most Sphagnum-rich site, a high proportion of existing Sphagnum cover was bleached one year after burning, but recovery occurred during the study period. Sphagnum re-introduction success decreased over the study period in the most recent and intermediate burn-age categories at the most Sphagnum-poor site. These results show that burning rotation length is an important factor in determining site-level vegetation composition on burned sites. More frequent burning will result in a greater proportion of land in the early post-burning stages, potentially resulting in a thinner moss layer, more bare peat and less healthy Sphagnum, with potential consequences for carbon balance. No evidence was found to support the use of burning as a tool to increase existing Sphagnum or promote Sphagnum re-establishment success.

AB Air pollution is a serious health problem in almost all developing and developed countries around the world. One component of air pollution dangerous for health is carbon monoxide (CO). The largest source of carbon monoxide is the burning of fossil fuels and peatland fires. The government continues to control pollution through both environmental management and summer pollution control. However, the resulting impact is less than optimal. We conducted a study to test the material used as an alternative respiratory protector in absorbing CO gas. The protective material comprised of a combination of spunbond, meltblown, and activated carbon materials. We carried the study out on a laboratory scale using experimental animals that were subjected to different stages of treatment. The results showed that respiratory protective masks with a combination of activated carbon and spunbond/meltblown materials were better able to inhibit CO exposure (p <= 0.001) than respiratory masks without activated carbon. The combination material is thus effective in absorbing CO; it can carry further research out on other harmful gases such as NO and NO2.

AB Feat cores (15 cm diam x 30 cm deep) from Ellergower Moss, New Galloway, Scotland were kept and monitored at constant temperature(10 +/-0.1 degrees C) for gas production using a 1.6 mm diam stainless steel probe fitted with a membrane inlet and connected to a quadrupole mass spectrometer.
   In the headspace, O-2, CO2 and CH4 (measured at m/z values 32, 44 and 15 respectively) showed diurnal fluctuations in low-intensity natural daylight and under a light-dark (LD, 12:12) regime.
   Over the first few cycles O-2 and CO2 increased together in the dark and decreased in the light, whereas CH4 showed variations in antiphase with the other two gases. CO2 and CH4 also showed diurnal oscillations at 15 cm depth, but these decreased together in the light whereas argon (m/z = 40) was not varying.
   A highly-damped free-run of the oscillations in gas concentrations at 15cm depth was evident for only 3 cycles in complete darkness and at constant temperature. This might suggest desynchronization between individual plants with different free-running periods.
   A hydrocarbon signal (m/z = 26) at 15 cm depth also showed diurnal cycles but out of phase with CO2 and CH4.
   We postulate a circadian control of microbiological activities imposed by the vascular plants (Carex, Eriophorum, Molinia, Calluna, Erica).
   Under natural conditions the pronounced temperature sensitivity of CO2 and CH4 emission results in entrainment to daily temperature cycles. The amplitudes of the rhythms are greatest when temperature and light intensity changes are most pronounced, i.e. when the fluctuations in environmental factors are most potent as synchronizers (zeitgebers) and as masking factors.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange between the atmosphere and a subalpine wetland located in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, at 3200 m elevation were measured during 1996-1998. Respiration, net CO2 flux, and CH4 flux were measured using the closed chamber method during snow-free periods and using gas diffusion calculations during snow-covered periods. The ranges of measured flux were 1.2-526 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) (respiration), -1056-100 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) (net CO2 exchange), and 0.1-36.8 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1) (a positive value represents efflux to the atmosphere). Respiration and CH4 emission were significantly correlated with 5 cm soil temperature. Annual respiration and CH4 emission were modeled by applying the flux-temperature relationships to a continuous soil temperature record during 1996-1998. Gross photosynthesis was modeled using a hyperbolic equation relating gross photosynthesis, photon flux density, and soil temperature. Modeled annual flux estimates indicate that the wetland was a net source of carbon gas to the atmosphere each of the three years: 8.9 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) in 1996, 9.5 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) in 1997, and 9.6 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) in 1998. This contrasts with the long-term carbon accumulation of similar to0.7 mol m(-2) yr(-1) determined from C analyses of a peat core collected from the wetland.

AB Northern peatlands store a globally significant amount of soil organic carbon, much of it found in rapidly thawing permafrost. Permafrost thaw in peatlands often leads to the development and expansion of thermokarst bogs, where microbial activity will determine the stability of the carbon storage and the release of greenhouse gases. In this study, we compared potential enzyme activities between young (thawed similar to 30 years ago) and mature (similar to 200 years) thermokarst bogs, for both shallow and deep peat layers. We found very low potential enzyme activities in deep peat layers, with no differences between the young and mature bogs. Peat quality at depth was found to be highly humified (FTIR analysis) in both the young and mature bogs. This suggests that deep, old peat was largely stable following permafrost thaw, without a rapid pulse of decomposition during the young bog stage. For near-surface peat, we found significantly higher potential enzyme activities in the young bog than in the mature-associated with differences in peat quality derived from different Sphagnum species. A laboratory incubation of near-surface peat showed that differences in potential enzyme activity were primarily influenced by peat type rather than oxygen availability. This suggested that the young bog can have higher rates of near-surface decomposition despite being substantially wetter than the mature bog. Overall, our study shows that peat properties are the dominant constraint on potential enzyme activity and that peatland site development (successional pathways and permafrost history) through its influence on peat type and chemistry is likely to determine peat decomposition following permafrost thaw.

TI RESPONSE OF METHANE EMISSION FROM ARCTIC TUNDRA TO CLIMATIC-CHANGE -
   RESULTS FROM A MODEL SIMULATION
SO TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PEAT; TEMPERATURE
AB Methane is an important greenhouse gas contributing approximately 15% to the present greenhouse warming. Tundra ecosystems between 50 degrees N and 70 degrees N are estimated to contain 14% of the global soil carbon and account for between 20 and 25% of the natural methane emissions. Consequently, enhanced anaerobic decomposition of tundra soil carbon and the associated increase in methane production could provide a significant positive feedback on the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. This work is an attempt to quantify this feedback for arctic tundra. A model of permafrost thermodynamics and methane emission has been developed for inclusion in the UK Meteorological Office land surface scheme. This improved scheme was tested by driving it directly with surface meteorological observations and comparing the simulated methane emission to those observed during a field study on the North Slope of Alaska. Results are also presented from simulations carried out with the single column version of the Hadley Centre climate model, for both current conditions and a simple doubled carbon dioxide warming scenario. The latter shows a significantly enhanced methane emission. In order to assess the dependence of this result on the particular scenario chosen, offline sensitivity studies were carried out using meteorological observations and a range of perturbations to air temperature and rainfall.

AB Empirical greenhouse gas (GHG) flux estimates from diverse peatlands are required in order to derive emission factors for managed peatlands. This study on a drained fen peatland quantified the annual GHG balance (Carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and C exported in crop yield) from spring barley (SB) and reed canary grass (RCG) using static opaque chambers for GHG flux measurements and biomass yield for indirectly estimating gross primary production (GPP). Estimates of ecosystem respiration (ER) and GPP were compared with more advanced but costly and labor-intensive dynamic chamber studies. Annual GHG balance for the two cropping systems was 4.0 +/- 0.7 and 8.1 +/- 0.2 Mg CO2-C-eq ha(-1) from SB and RCG, respectively (mean +/- standard error, n= 3). Annual CH4 emissions were negligible (<0.006 Mg CO2-C-eq ha(-1)), and N2O emissions contributed only 4-13 % of the full GHG balance (0.5 and 0.3 Mg CO2-C-eq ha(-1) for SB and RCG, respectively). The statistical significance of low CH4 and N2O fluxes was evaluated by a simulation procedure which showed that most of CH4 fluxes were within the range that could arise from random variation associated with actual zero-flux situations. ER measured by static chamber and dynamic chamber methods was similar, particularly when using nonlinear regression techniques for flux calculations. A comparison of GPP derived from aboveground biomass and from measuring net ecosystem exchange (NEE) showed that GPP estimation from biomass might be useful, or serve as validation, for more advanced flux measurement methods. In conclusion, combining static opaque chambers for measuring ER of CO2 and CH4 and N2O fluxes with biomass yield for GPP estimation worked well in the drained fen peatland cropped to SB and RCG and presented a valid alternative to estimating the full GHG balance by dynamic chambers.

AB Peatlands, which account for approximately 15% of land surface across the arctic and boreal regions of the globe, are experiencing a range of ecological impacts as a result of climate change. Factors that include altered hydrology resulting from drought and permafrost thaw, rising temperatures, and elevated levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide have been shown to cause plant community compositional changes. Shifts in plant composition affect the productivity, species diversity, and carbon cycling of peatlands. We used hyperspectral remote sensing to characterize the response of boreal peatland plant composition and species diversity to warming, hydrologic change, and elevated CO2. Hyperspectral remote sensing techniques offer the ability to complete landscape-scale analyses of ecological responses to climate disturbance when paired with plot-level measurements that link ecosystem biophysical properties with spectral reflectance signatures. Working within two large ecosystem manipulation experiments, we examined climate controls on composition and diversity in two types of common boreal peatlands: a nutrient rich fen located at the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX) in central Alaska, and an ombrotrophic bog located in northern Minnesota at the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment. We found a strong effect of plant functional cover on spectral reflectance characteristics. We also found a positive relationship between species diversity and spectral variation at the APEX field site, which is consistent with other recently published findings. Based on the results of our field study, we performed a supervised land cover classification analysis on an aerial hyperspectral dataset to map peatland plant functional types (PFTs) across an area encompassing a range of different plant communities. Our results underscore recent advances in the application of remote sensing measurements to ecological research, particularly in far northern ecosystems.

AB Close association between hydrology and ecosystem productivity in boreal transition zones requires that modelling ecosystem productivity in these zones be based on accurate modelling of water table dynamics. We hypothesize that these dynamics are driven by transfers of water through surface and lateral boundaries of transition zones, and that lateral transfers can be calculated from hydraulic gradients with external water tables at upper and lower boundaries. In this study we implement these hypotheses in the ecosys model to simulate water table dynamics along a boreal transition zone (ecotone) in central Saskatchewan, Canada, extending from upland black spruce forest down to a poor forested fen. Simulated water table depths were compared to measured values at upper, middle and lower ecotone positions during the dry year 2003 when peat was dried, the very wet year 2004 when peat was rewetted, and the hydrologically average year 2005 when peat remained wet. These hypotheses enabled ecosys to simulate declines in water table depth with declines in elevation along the ecotone that matched well those observed during each of the three years. Observed:expected plots of modelled vs. measured water table depths at all positions indicated reasonable goodness of fit with slopes (with respect to 1:1 line) and R-2 of 0.92 and 0.53 in 2003-2005 period, 0.90 and 0.28 in 2003, 0.81 and 0.51 in 2004, 0.97 and 0.46 in 2005, confirming that our hypotheses enabled changes in water table depths along boreal transition zones to be properly modelled during successively dry, wet and normal years.

AB Permafrost melting is occurring in areas of the boreal forest region where large amounts of carbon ( C) are stored in organic soils. We measured soil respiration, net CO2 flux, and net CH4 flux during May - September 2003 and March 2004 in a black spruce lowland in interior Alaska to better understand how permafrost thaw in poorly drained landscapes affects land-atmosphere CO2 and CH4 exchange. Sites included peat soils underlain by permafrost at similar to 0.4 m depth ( permafrost plateau, PP), four thermokarst wetlands ( TW) having no permafrost in the upper 2.2 m, and peat soils bordering the thermokarst wetlands having permafrost at similar to 0.5 m depth ( thermokarst edges, TE). Soil respiration rates were not significantly different among the sites, and 5-cm soil temperature explained 50 - 91% of the seasonal variability in soil respiration within the sites. Groundcover vegetation photosynthesis ( calculated as net CO2 minus soil respiration) was significantly different among the sites ( TW > TE > PP), which can be partly attributed to the difference in photosynthetically active radiation reaching the ground at each site type. Methane emission rates were 15 to 28 times greater from TW than from TE and PP. We modeled annual soil respiration and groundcover vegetation photosynthesis using soil temperature and radiation data, and CH4 flux by linear interpolation. We estimated all sites as net C gas sources to the atmosphere ( not including tree CO2 uptake at PP and TE), although the ranges in estimates when accounting for errors were large enough that TE and TW may have been net C sinks.

AB Climate change and associated sea level rise will likely affect coastal ecosystems and lead to more frequent inundations. Plants are an important control for methane (CH4) emissions in peatlands because the metabolism of the living plant can either enhance or attenuate CH4 emissions and plant litter supplies an easily available carbon source for methanogenesis. Here we compare the contribution of various dominant plant species to methane emissions in a degraded, rewetted coastal brackish fen at the southern Baltic Sea coast in Northeast Germany. We analyse one year of bi-weekly static closed chamber data gathered at measurement spots that were located in different mono-dominant vegetation stands (Bolboschoenus maritimus (L.) Palla, Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani (C.C.Gmel.) Palla, Carex acutiformis Ehrh.). Furthermore, data on water level, water temperature, conductivity (sulphate), and several peat characteristics were recorded. Generally, the annual methane emissions were low with an average across vegetation stands of 14 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1), which we related to high decomposition of peat after drainage and to relatively low water levels in summer. Nevertheless, methane emissions varied between different vegetation types with significantly higher methane fluxes (31.8 +/- A 5.7 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1)) from Bolboschoenus maritimus stands compared to Carex acutiformis and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani stands (4.3 +/- A 1.2 and 5.7 +/- A 2.4 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1), respectively). None of the environmental variables that have been recorded can explain this difference. Thus, vegetation composition seems to be an important driver for methane emissions in coastal brackish fens and may therefore be crucial with regard to recreation measures.

AB Warming greatly reshapes carbon cycle of peatlands where soil is water saturated with anaerobic condition prevailing all the year round. However, little is known about the response of anaerobic mineralization of peatlands carbon to global warming, especially when considering the difference of soil from above water table (AWT) and below water table (BWT). This study measured variations in soil carbon anaerobic mineralization as a function of warming and depth by sampling 100-cm soil columns in Zoige plateau. Warming enhanced carbon anaerobic mineralization significantly with different increments among the whole depths. The response of CO2-C and CH4-C to warming varied with depth: at surface soil, both CO2-C and CH4-C emission increased with higher increment; at deep soil, CO2-C emission increased with small increment and CH4-C emission decreased. Substrate availability influenced carbon anaerobic mineralization rate and pathway. Substantial resistant carbon at deep soil lowered CO2 increment and varied CH4 production pathway. The temperature sensitivity of peat carbon anaerobic mineralization varied with depth, suggesting the heterogeneous distribution of soil substrate among the whole depths. AWT soil was higher in temperature sensitivity than BWT soil for the substantial simple carbon and higher microbial/enzyme activity at AWT. BWT soil was a major contributor of the amount of carbon emission and the total increased carbon caused by warming. Further, for the management of peatlands, we should conduct advanced research by focusing more towards the soil of whole depth, especially on the temperature sensitivity of AWT soil and the contribution to total carbon emission of BWT soil.

AB Sphagnum mosses dominate peatlands by employing harsh ecosystem tactics to prevent vascular plant growth and microbial degradation of these large carbon stores. Knowledge about Sphagnum-produced metabolites, their structure and their function, is important to better understand the mechanisms, underlying this carbon sequestration phenomenon in the face of climate variability. It is currently unclear which compounds are responsible for inhibition of organic matter decomposition and the mechanisms by which this inhibition occurs. Metabolite profiling of Sphagnum fallax was performed using two types of mass spectrometry (MS) systems and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR). Lipidome profiling was performed using LC-MS/MS. A total of 655 metabolites, including one hundred fifty-two lipids, were detected by NMR and LC-MS/MS-329 of which were novel metabolites (31 unknown lipids). Sphagum fallax metabolite profile was composed mainly of acid-like and flavonoid glycoside compounds, that could be acting as potent antimicrobial compounds, allowing Sphagnum to control its environment. Sphagnum fallax metabolite composition comparison against previously known antimicrobial plant metabolites confirmed this trend, with seventeen antimicrobial compounds discovered to be present in Sphagnum fallax, the majority of which were acids and glycosides. Biological activity of these compounds needs to be further tested to confirm antimicrobial qualities. Three fungal metabolites were identified providing insights into fungal colonization that may benefit Sphagnum. Characterizing the metabolite profile of Sphagnum fallax provided a baseline to understand the mechanisms in which Sphagnum fallax acts on its environment, its relation to carbon sequestration in peatlands, and provide key biomarkers to predict peatland C store changes (sequestration, emissions) as climate shifts.

AB The surface of bogs is commonly patterned and composed of different vegetation communities, defined by water level. Carbon dioxide (CO2) dynamics vary spatially between the vegetation communities. An understanding of the controls on the spatial variation of CO2 dynamics is required to assess the role of bogs in the global carbon cycle. The water level gradient in a blanket bog was described and the CO2 exchange along the gradient investigated using chamber based measurements in combination with regression modelling. The aim was to investigate the controls on gross photosynthesis (PG), ecosystem respiration (RE) and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) as well as the spatial and temporal variation in these fluxes. Vegetation structure was strongly controlled by water level. The species with distinctive water level optima were separated into the opposite ends of the gradient in canonical correspondence analysis. The number of species and leaf area were highest in the intermediate water level range and these communities had the highest PG. Photosynthesis was highest when the water level was 11 cm below the surface. Ecosystem respiration, which includes decomposition, was less dependent on vegetation structure and followed the water level gradient more directly. The annual NEE varied from -115 to 768 g CO2 m(-2), being lowest in wet and highest in dry vegetation communities. The temporal variation was most pronounced in PG, which decreased substantially during winter, when photosynthetic photon flux density and leaf area were lowest. Ecosystem respiration, which is dependent on temperature, was less variable and wintertime RE fluxes constituted approximately 24% of the annual flux.

AB Peatland restoration has been attracting increasing attention and implementation since large areas of peatlands in China have been degraded or reclaimed to cropland in recent decades. However, the length of time for cultivated peatland to be restored to natural climax level in terms of vegetation remained unknown. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the characteristics of hydrology, plant community, and soil in abandoned 0-, 2-, 15-, and 30-year-old paddy lands and a natural peatland. The results showed a long-term rise in water level after restoration. Similarity indexes between restored sites and natural peatland also increased with the extension of restoration time. During the first three years after abandonment, weeds grew vigorously and almost overtook the entire experimental site. However, the plant community was dominated by a Carex schmidtii-Phragmites australis-Thelypteris palustris community, where similarity increased to 64% and vegetation succession approached a natural climax community after 15 years of restoration. Compared with the paddy field, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic matter (TOM) in the soil at 0-30 cm depth and soil bulk density at 0-60 cm showed no significant change after 2 years of restoration. In the 15-year restoration site, however, TN and TOM at 0-30 cm increased by 108% and 86%, respectively (P < 0.01), and soil bulk density at 0-60 cm decreased by 40% compared with the paddy field (P < 0.05), and the values were already similar to the 30-year site and the natural peatland. Those findings indicate that the cultivated peatland could be restored effectively through natural succession. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increases in ground temperature make soil organic carbon in permafrost environments highly vulnerable to release to the atmosphere. High-centred polygonal terrain is a form of patterned ground that may act as a large source of carbon to the atmosphere because thawing ice wedges can result in increased ground temperatures, soil moisture, and thaw depth. To evaluate the effect of ice wedge degradation on carbon flux, carbon emissions were characterized at two polygonal peatlands in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands in northern Canada. Opaque chambers were used to measure CO2 and CH4 emissions from nine nondegraded polygon centres and nine moderately degraded troughs four times during the growing season. To measure emissions from 10 ponds resulting from severe ice wedge degradation, wind diffusion models were used to characterize fluxes using CO2 and CH4 concentration measurements made in each pond. Our field data show that degraded troughs had increased ground temperature, deeper active layers, and increased CO2 and CH4 emissions. Our study shows that rates of CO2 and CH4 emissions from high-centreed polygonal terrain are likely to increase with more widespread melt pond formation in this terrain type.

AB The interference between vascular plants and peat mosses with respect to nitrogen and phosphorus was studied in a fertilization experiment and with respect to competition for light in a removal experiment in poor fens with either soligenous or topogenous hydrology using Narthecium ossifragum (L.) Huds. and three species of Sphagnum sect. Sphagnum as targets. Adding fertilizer either on the moss surface or below it confirmed the hypotheses of an asymmetric competition for nutrients, viz. that the Sphagnum mosses relied on the atmospheric supply while Narthecium depended on mineralization in the peat. The results of the removal experiments and the negatively correlated growth of Narthecium and Sphagnum mosses demonstrated a symmetric competition for light. The intensity of the competition for light increased as the availability of N and P increased. The nutrient resources in the total biomass decreased with decreasing standing crop of Narthecium. Only with a considerable amount of mineral nutrients in the biomass has Narthecium the capacity to grow ahead of Sphagnum, because the asymmetric competition for N and P gives Sphagnum the capacity to reduce the performance of vascular plants. The mosses are more efficient in their use of nutrients and produce a decay-resistant litter inducing low mineralization and increasing the peat accumulation rate, and that withdraws N and P from the rhizosphere. The Sphagnum mosses thus act as ecological engineers structuring the plant community and determining the carbon balance of the system. The development of ombrotrophic conditions through peat accumulation seems less probable on soligenous than on topogenous mires owing to the higher mineralization rate there supporting the growth of the vascular plants. Correspondingly, disturbances of the Sphagnum cover, such as through airborne pollutants, increase the productivity of the vascular plants and decrease the capacity for carbon accumulation.

AB Understanding the responses of the carbon-rich peatland ecosystems to past climate change is crucial for predicting peat carbon fate in the future. Here we presented a data synthesis of peatland initiation ages, area changes, and peat carbon (C) accumulation rate variations in China since the Holocene, along with total C pool estimates. The data showed different controls of peatland expansion and C accumulation in different regions. The peat C accumulation rates were 32.3 (ranging from 20.7 to 50.2) g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and 14.7 (ranging from 7.4 to 36.5) g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the Northeast China (NEC). The peaks of peatland expansion and C accumulation in the QTP occurred in the early Holocene in response to high summer insolation and strong summer-winter climate seasonality. The rapid peatland expansion and maximum C accumulation rate in the NEC occurred in the middle-late Holocene. Peatlands scattered in the coastal and lakeside regions of China expanded rapidly at the onset of the Holocene due to large transgression, consistent with the stronger summer insolation and monsoon, and during the middle and late Holocene, as a response to the high and stable sea level and the strong summer monsoon. The carbon storage of peatlands in China was estimated as 2.17 (ranging from 1.16 to 3.18) Pg, among which 1.49 (ranging from 0.58 to 2.40) Pg was contributed by peatlands in the QTP, 021 (ranging from 0.11 to 0.31) Pg by those in the NEC, and 0.47 Pg by those scattered in other regions of China. Our comparison of peatlands dynamics among regions in China showed that climate and monsoon are the essential factors in determining the expansion and carbon accumulation patterns of peatlands, although their effects on peatland formation and C accumulation is complex owing to land availability in peatland basins and regional moisture conditions.

AB Question: What are the effects of shallow flooding on boreal peatlands on vegetation composition and size of carbon pools in the living and dead vegetation?
   Location: Lake 979, Experimental Lakes Area, northwestern Ontario, Canada.
   Methods: A boreal basin peatland complex with treed bog, open bog, and open water was experimentally flooded by raising water level ca. 1.3 m. Vegetation and above-ground biomass were compared between pre-flood conditions and those nine years after flooding. Peat accumulation since flooding was also quantified.
   Results: Flooding caused almost all trees to die, leading to a net loss of 86% of the above-ground living plant biomass after nine years of the flooding. Floating up of peat was rapid in the central part of the basin, and the floating peat mats were characterized by newly established open bog community. Wetland types were diversified from bog into open bog, fen, and marsh, accompanied with great species turnover. Floating open bog community accumulated the greatest amount of peat since flooding.
   Conclusions: This study shows that shallow flooding of bog vegetation can lead to quick re-establishment of open bog vegetation upon the floating up of peat mats as well as changes to more diverse vegetation over decadal time spans. We estimate that the carbon pools in 2002 in living and dead plant biomass since 1992 are comparable to what they were in the above-ground biomass in 1992. Flooding caused an initial net decrease in carbon stores, but carbon in the pre-flood living plant biomass was replaced by both carbon in dead biomass of the pre-flood vegetation and newly sequestered carbon in new peat growth and post-flood living plant biomass. Possible vegetation change toward bog-dominated system could lead to increasing rate of new peat growth, which could affect future carbon sink/source strength of the system.

AB Sphagnum moss is the major peat-forming vegetation component in boreal peatlands. The relationship between Sphagnum productivity and moss moisture content has been documented; however, the link between moss moisture content and conditions in the underlying peat column is less clear. We conducted a pilot study in which we monitored volumetric moisture content with depth and gravimetric water content of Sphagnum capitula and CO2 exchange for two peat monoliths with intact moss layer dominated by Sphagnum fuscum and S. magellanicum. Measurements were made under drying conditions and rewetting from below and following simulated precipitation events. Capitulum moisture content was related to water table position but varied between species. Both capitulum moisture content and water table position could be used to explain net CO2 exchange and respiration during drying and rewetting from below, although hysteresis was apparent where respiration was lower on rewetting than drying for the same water table position. Precipitation complicated these relationships because small events (<5 mm) rewetted the upper few centimeters of moss resulting in a change in capitulum moisture content equivalent to a rise in water table position of similar to 20 cm. This change in capitulum moisture content resulted in substantial shifts in both photosynthesis and respiration rates without affecting water table position or subsurface volumetric water contents as shallow as 5 cm below the surface. While these small events will be difficult to measure in the field, this study suggests they are essential to effectively track or model Sphagnum productivity because they may contribute significantly to seasonal carbon balance.

AB Alpine wetlands play a sensitive function in global carbon cycle during the ongoing climate warming, yet the temporal patterns of carbon dynamics from in situ ground-based long-term observations remain unclear. Here, we analyzed the continuous net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) measured with the eddy covariance technique over an alpine peatland on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from 2007 to 2016. The wetland acted as a net CO2 source with a positive NEE (120.4 +/- 34.8 gC m(-2) year(-1), Mean +/- SD), with the mean annual gross primary productivity (GPP) of 500.3 +/- 59.4 gC m(-2) year(-1) and annual ecosystem respiration (RES) of 620.7 +/- 74.2 gC m(-2) year(-1). At the seasonal scale, the classification and regression trees (CART) analysis showed that aggregated growing season degree days (GDDs) were the predominant determinant on variations in monthly NEE and monthly GPP. Variations in monthly RES were determined by soil temperature (Ts). Furthermore, nongrowing season Ts had a significant positive correlation with the following year annual GPP (p < 0.05). Nongrowing season RES only accounted for about 25% of annual RES but had significant correlation with annual RES and annual NEE (p < 0.05). The further partial correlation analysis showed that nongrowing season air temperature (Ta, p = 0.05), rather than precipitation (PPT, p = 0.25) was a predominant determinant on variations in annual NEE. Our results highlighted the importance in carbon dynamics of climate fluctuations and CO2 emission from the nongrowing season in alpine wetlands. We speculated that the vast peadlands would positively feedback to climate change on the Tibetan plateau where the nongrowing season warming was significant.

AB We measured the change in above- and below-ground carbon and nutrient pools 11 years after the harvesting and site preparation of a histic-mineral soil wetland forest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The original stand of black spruce (Picea mariana), jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and tamarack (Larix laricina) was whole-tree harvested, and three post-harvest treatments (disk trenching, bedding, and none) were randomly assigned to three Latin square blocks (n = 9). Nine control plots were also established in an adjoining uncut stand. Carbon and nutrients were measured in three strata of above-ground vegetation, woody debris, roots, forest floor, and mineral soil to a depth of 1.5 m. Eleven years following harvesting, soil C, N, Ca, Mg, and K pools were similar among the three site preparation treatments and the uncut stand. However, there were differences in ecosystem-level nutrient pools because of differences in live biomass. Coarse roots comprised approximately 30% of the tree biomass C in the regenerated stands and 18% in the uncut stand. Nutrient sequestration, in the vegetation since harvesting yielded an average net ecosystem gain of 332 kg N ha(-1), 110 kg Ca ha(-1), 18 kg Mg ha(-1), and 65 kg K ha(-1). The likely source for the cations and N is uptake from shallow groundwater, but N additions could also come from non-symbiotic N-fixation and N deposition. These are the only reported findings on long-term effects of harvesting and site preparation on a histic-mineral soil wetland and the results illustrate the importance of understanding the ecohydrology and nutrient dynamics of the wetland forest. This wetland type appears less sensitive to disturbance than upland sites, and is capable of sustained productivity under these silvicultural treatments. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We present quantitative reconstructions of regional vegetation cover in north-western Europe, western Europe north of the Alps, and eastern Europe for five time windows in the Holocene [around 6k, 3k, 0.5k, 0.2k, and 0.05k calendar years before present (bp)] at a 1 degrees x1 degrees spatial scale with the objective of producing vegetation descriptions suitable for climate modelling. The REVEALS model was applied on 636 pollen records from lakes and bogs to reconstruct the past cover of 25 plant taxa grouped into 10 plant-functional types and three land-cover types [evergreen trees, summer-green (deciduous) trees, and open land]. The model corrects for some of the biases in pollen percentages by using pollen productivity estimates and fall speeds of pollen, and by applying simple but robust models of pollen dispersal and deposition. The emerging patterns of tree migration and deforestation between 6k bp and modern time in the REVEALS estimates agree with our general understanding of the vegetation history of Europe based on pollen percentages. However, the degree of anthropogenic deforestation (i.e. cover of cultivated and grazing land) at 3k, 0.5k, and 0.2k bp is significantly higher than deduced from pollen percentages. This is also the case at 6k in some parts of Europe, in particular Britain and Ireland. Furthermore, the relationship between summer-green and evergreen trees, and between individual tree taxa, differs significantly when expressed as pollen percentages or as REVEALS estimates of tree cover. For instance, when Pinus is dominant over Picea as pollen percentages, Picea is dominant over Pinus as REVEALS estimates. These differences play a major role in the reconstruction of European landscapes and for the study of land cover-climate interactions, biodiversity and human resources.

AB In Europe, agriculture on managed peat wetlands is often a balance between maximising farming production, whether hay harvest or cattle production or both, and a desire to maintain a threatened ecological landscape with its flora and fauna. Because of the large amount of carbon stored in peat soils, the management of peat wetlands to minimise the production of atmospheric greenhouse gases is also now a priority. Eddy correlation and allied radiation and soil physics measurements were made continuously over several years at a wetland meadow peat site that is subject to a water level management scheme, at Tadham Moor in the Somerset Levels and Moors, UK. These measurements provided estimates of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) and, through established models, estimates of Gross Photosynthetic Production (GPP), and separate soil and plant respiration. A relationship between depth to the water table and soil respiration was established that showed increasing ecosystem respiration with increasing depth to the water table. Annual results are presented for 2002, which also incorporate harvest and cattle carbon gains and losses. In 2002, the site had a significant loss of soil carbon of 59 gC m(-2) y(-1) compared to the historical long-term carbon uptake of natural peat-lands. However, it is shown that the current implementation of the management scheme is ineffective in maintaining the prescribed water levels in the ditches. A consequence of this is that desired water levels in the field are not achieved. Controlling the management scheme for in-field water levels (rather than channel levels) is shown to decrease markedly the annual soil respiration and hence help to maintain the current soil carbon stocks without affecting the current farming practice.

AB The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; similar to 56 million years ago) is the most severe carbon cycle perturbation event of the Cenozoic. Although the PETM is associated with warming in both the surface (up to 8 degrees C) and deep ocean (up to 5 degrees C), there are relatively few terrestrial temperature estimates from the onset of this interval. The associated response of the hydrological cycle during the PETM is also poorly constrained. Here, we use biomarker proxies (informed by models) to reconstruct temperature and hydrological change within the Cobham Lignite (UK) during the latest Paleocene and early PETM. Previous work at this site indicates warm terrestrial temperatures during the very latest Paleocene (ca. 22-26 degrees C). However, biomarker temperature proxies imply cooling during the onset of the PETM (ca. 5-11 degrees C cooling), inconsistent with other local, regional and global evidence. This coincides with an increase in pH (ca. 2 pH units with pH values > 7), enhanced waterlogging, a major reduction in fires and the development of areas of open water within a peatland environment. This profound change in hydrology and environment evidently biases biomarker temperature proxies, including the branched GDGT paleothermometer. This serves as a cautionary tale on the danger of attempting to interpret biomarker proxy records without a wider understanding of their environmental context.

AB Spiked-sediment toxicity tests with benthic organisms are routinely used to assess the potential ecological impact of sediment-associated hydrophobic organic contaminants. Although several sediment tests have been standardized, experimental factors such as spiking methods still vary between laboratories. To identify the experimental factors that affect the bioavailability of contaminants and account for the highest percentage of the variability of toxicity values (i.e., 50% lethal concentration; LC50), we performed a meta-analysis of published 10-14-day spiked-sediment toxicity tests with the standard test species Hyalella azteca and Chironomus dilutus. Analysis of 172 test records revealed that the variability of sediment LC50s for a given combination of chemical and test species was large. The mean coefficient of variation (CV) was 65%, even after organic carbon normalization, and was slightly larger than the CV in water-only tests (49%). Regression analyses revealed that the most important factor contributing to the variability of the sediment LC50s was sediment type (i.e., environmental or formulated sediment) and that use of formulated sediment (i.e., composed of peat, cellulose, or leaves as organic carbon source) tended to cause higher toxicity than use of environmental sediment. This might be caused by the difference in partitioning the coefficient of organic contaminants and the resulting difference in the bioavailability between sediment types. The effects of other factors, including aging periods and spiking methods, were insignificant or specific to certain chemicals. These discoveries facilitate refinement of the methodologies used in sediment toxicity testing and the correct interpretation of test results. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2021;00:1-11. (c) 2021 SETAC

AB The candidate phyla radiation (CPR) is a diverse group of uncultured bacterial lineages with poorly understood metabolic functions. CPR bacteria can represent a large proportion of the total planktonic microbial community in subarctic thermokarst lakes, but their functional roles remain unexplored. We applied sequential water filtration and metagenomic shotgun sequencing to a peatland permafrost thaw lake, and found high proportions of CPR bacteria in both summer and winter (> 40% of 16S rRNA reads in the 0.02-0.22 mu m pore-size fraction). The metagenome-assembled genomes of CPR bacteria representatives showed capacities to degrade and ferment permafrost- and peatland-derived organic matter. Potential products of their metabolic activities included acetate, CO2, and hydrogen, implying a syntrophic relationship with other community members, including methanogens and methanotrophs. The results indicate biogeochemical interdependencies in organic matter utilization within thermokarst microbial communities, with CPR members playing a key intermediate role in carbon and methane cycling.

AB Drainage has turned peatlands from a carbon sink into one of the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG) sources from cultivated soils. We analyzed a unique data set (12 peatlands, 48 sites and 122 annual budgets) of mainly unpublished GHG emissions from grasslands on bog and fen peat as well as other soils rich in soil organic carbon (SOC) in Germany. Emissions and environmental variables were measured with identical methods. Site-averaged GHG budgets were surprisingly variable (29.2 +/- 17.4 t CO2-eq. ha(-1)yr(-1)) and partially higher than all published data and the IPCC default emission factors for GHG inventories. Generally, CO2 (27.7 +/- 17.3 t CO(2)ha(-1)yr(-1)) dominated the GHG budget. Nitrous oxide (2.3 +/- 2.4kg N2O-N ha(-1)yr(-1)) and methane emissions (30.8 +/- 69.8kg CH4-C ha(-1)yr(-1)) were lower than expected except for CH4 emissions from nutrient-poor acidic sites. At single peatlands, CO2 emissions clearly increased with deeper mean water table depth (WTD), but there was no general dependency of CO2 on WTD for the complete data set. Thus, regionalization of CO2 emissions by WTD only will remain uncertain. WTD dynamics explained some of the differences between peatlands as sites which became very dry during summer showed lower emissions. We introduced the aerated nitrogen stock (N-air) as a variable combining soil nitrogen stocks with WTD. CO2 increased with N-air across peatlands. Soils with comparatively low SOC concentrations showed as high CO2 emissions as true peat soils because N-air was similar. N2O emissions were controlled by the WTD dynamics and the nitrogen content of the topsoil. CH4 emissions can be well described by WTD and ponding duration during summer. Our results can help both to improve GHG emission reporting and to prioritize and plan emission reduction measures for peat and similar soils at different scales.

AB The Maximum Power Principle (MPP) - a theoretical construct that argues that systems develop to maximize energy throughput, or power - is the subject of few empirical studies. We used the MPP to explore the thermodynamic basis for microbial processes and greenhouse gas fluxes in high latitude peat soils. Increasing temperatures cause extensive areas of permafrost degradation, which can lead to wetland formation, though permafrost degradation and aggradation can be cyclical under the right conditions. Differential ecosystem responses to permafrost degradation offer an opportunity to use the unifying approach of thermodynamics. We used adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in peat soils as a soil-relevant proxy for power to test the MPP along a chronosequence of wetlands with time following permafrost degradation. We conducted soil incubation experiments and measured production rates of CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ATP. ATP production was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the young bog soils compared to the undisturbed permafrost bog soils; rates in the older bog soils were not different from either site. Our results suggest that power output increased following recovery from permafrost thaw. A unifying vantage point provided by thermodynamics may be useful in other investigations of wetland ecosystems with unpredictable responses to disturbance.

AB Organic-rich wetland soils in the histosol soil order represent the largest soil carbon (C) pool globally. Carbon accumulation in these ecosystems is largely due to oxygen (O-2) limitation of decomposition. Increased O-2 availability from wetland drainage and climate change may stimulate C decomposition overall and affect the balance of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) greenhouse gas release. Characterizing relationships, including non-linearity, between soil O-2 and C gas emissions is therefore critical to predict the partitioning and rate of C release from histosols under greater O-2 availability. We varied gas-phase O-2 concentration from 0.03 to 20 % in incubations of a sapric histosol and measured resulting CO2 and CH4 emissions. Efflux of CO2 increased and CH4 emissions decreased at higher O-2 concentrations, and rates were best described by log-linear model fits. The non-linear response of CO2 and CH4 emissions to O-2 concentration indicates that moist, C rich histosols may be highly sensitive to increases in O-2 availability, even below concentration thresholds typically classified as anoxic.

AB For the past 70 yr, researchers in the Soil Science/Renewable Resources Department at the University of Alberta have used isotopes to study topics of ecological importance. This review highlights the soil isotope research conducted within our department over this time, including an historical overview of studies of interest. Analytical techniques and advances in instrumentation are discussed, focusing on the measurement of light stable isotope ratios (i.e., for C, H, N, S, and O) using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). Early soil isotope work (1950-2000s) focused on agricultural soils and soil fertility issues. These studies included the use of radioactive isotopes such as C-14 and S-35, and (or) artificially enriched stable isotopes including N-15-labelled fertilizers. More recently (2000-present), the scope of research widened to include natural-abundance stable isotope ratio studies as higher-sensitivity IRMS systems became more prevalent. Current isotope research topics include N biogeochemistry in natural and managed ecosystems, land management effects on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon cycling in northern landscapes, paleo-reconstruction in peatlands, carbon sequestration in boreal forests, and biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. Further technological progress also enabled new techniques such as compound-specific IRMS analysis, including delta C-13 and delta H-2 measurements of soil n-alkanes and phospholipid fatty acids. In conclusion, current IRMS instrumentation presents unparalleled opportunities for multidisciplinary research to track carbon, plant nutrients, and pollutants as they move through soils.

AB Thermokarst features, such as thaw ponds, are hotspots for methane emissions in warming lowland tundra. Presently we lack quantitative knowledge on the formation rates of thaw ponds and subsequent vegetation succession, necessary to determine their net contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. This study sets out to identify development trajectories and formation rates of small-scale (<100 m(2)), shallow arctic thaw ponds in north-eastern Siberia. We selected 40 ponds of different age classes based on a time-series of satellite images and measured vegetation composition, microtopography, water table, and thaw depth in the field and measured age of colonizing shrubs in thaw ponds using dendrochronology. We found that young ponds are characterized by dead shrubs, while older ponds show rapid terrestrialization through colonization by sedges andSphagnummoss. While dead shrubs and open water are associated with permafrost degradation (lower surface elevation, larger thaw depth), sites with sedge and in particularSphagnumdisplay indications of permafrost recovery. Recruitment ofBetula nanaonSphagnumcarpets in ponds indicates a potential recovery toward shrub-dominated vegetation, although it remains unclear if and on what timescale this occurs. Our results suggest that thaw ponds display potentially cyclic vegetation succession associated with permafrost degradation and recovery. Pond formation and initial colonization by sedges can occur on subdecadal timescales, suggesting rapid degradation and initial recovery of permafrost. The rates of formation and recovery of small-scale, shallow thaw ponds have implications for the greening/browning dynamics and carbon balance of this ecosystem.

AB The numerous water bodies and their riparian zones in the boreal zone are crucial to lateral carbon transport and can thus be very significant for carbon cycle on the landscape level. Therefore, we installed automatic measurement systems with Vaisala CARBOCAP CO2 probes (Vaisala Oyj, Vantaa, Finland) in the riparian zone soil matrix around a small headwater lake, in the lake itself, and in the out flowing brook and followed the seasonal and diurnal variation in CO2 concentration as well as rain event-driven changes in this natural-state soil-lake-brook continuum in Southern Finland. Seasonal variation was greatest and concentrations highest deep in the soil and in the lake, but were also noticeable in the brook. On the other hand, diurnal variation was highest in shallow soil layers and the lake surface. In the brook, the influence of the riparian zone superseded that of the lake at less than 150 m distance, which resulted in wider variation and higher concentrations of CO2 . After the rain event, the normal diurnal pattern was changed, and the CO2 concentration in the soil increased as water filled the soil pores and slowed down the diffusion. Even though the water with lower CO2 concentration from the lake diluted the CO2 concentration in the brook, the input from the soil dominated the flow after the rain and concentrations increased. On an annual basis, the flow of terrestrial dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) into the aquatic ecosystem was 1-13% of terrestrial net ecosystem production (NEP).

AB Biocathodes in bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) can be used to convert CO2 into diverse organic compounds through a process called microbial electrosynthesis. Unfortunately, start-up of anaerobic biocathodes in BESs is a difficult and time consuming process. Here, a pre-enrichment method was developed to improve start-up of anaerobic facultatively autotrophic biocathodes capable of using cathodes as the electron donor (electrotrophs) and CO2 as the electron acceptor. Anaerobic enrichment of bacteria from freshwater bog sediment samples was first performed in batch cultures fed with glucose and then used to inoculate BES cathode chambers set at 0.4V (versus a standard hydrogen electrode; SHE). After two weeks of heterotrophic operation of BESs, CO2 was provided as the sole electron acceptor and carbon source. Consumption of electrons from cathodes increased gradually and was sustained for about two months in concert with a significant decrease in cathode chamber headspace CO2. The maximum current density consumed was -34 +/- 4 mA/m(2). Biosynthesis resulted in organic compounds that included butanol, ethanol, acetate, propionate, butyrate, and hydrogen gas. Bacterial community analyses based on 16S rRNA gene clone libraries revealed Trichococcus palustris DSM 9172(99% sequence identity) as the prevailing species in biocathode communities, followed by Oscillibacter sp. and Clostridium sp. Isolates from autotrophic cultivation were most closely related to Clostridium propionicum (99% sequence identity; ZZ16), Clostridium celerecrescens (98-99%; ZZ22, ZZ23), Desulfotomaculum sp. (97%; ZZ21), and Tissierella sp. (98%; ZZ25). This pre-enrichment procedure enables simplified start-up of anaerobic biocathodes for applications such as electrofuel production by facultatively autotrophic electrotrophs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB We report the use of a model system that examines the dynamics of biological energy availability in organic matter in a sphagnum peat potting mix critical to sustenance of microorganism-mediated biological control of pythium root rot, a soilborne plant disease caused by Pythium ultimum. The concentration of readily degradable carbohydrate in the peat, mostly present as cellulose, was characterized by cross-polarized magic-angle spinning C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A decrease in the carbohydrate concentration in the mix was observed during the initial 10 weeks after potting as the rate of hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate declined below a critical threshold level required for biological control of pythium root rot. Throughout this period, total microbial biomass and activity, based on rates of [C-14]acetate incorporation into phospholipids, did not change but shifts in culturable bacterial species composition occurred. Species capable of inducing biocontrol were succeeded by pleomorphic gram-positive genera and putative oligotrophs not or less effective in control. We conclude that sustained efficacy of naturally occurring biocontrol agents was limited by energy availability to this microflora within the organic matter contained in the potting mix. We propose that this critical role of organic matter may be a key factor explaining the variability in efficacy typically encountered in the control of pythium root rot with biocontrol agents.

TI The reserves and losses of organic carbon in the soils of Siberia
SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The organic carbon database for the soils of Siberia has been developed. It includes data on humus content and bulk density determined in 5850 and 2300 soil pits, respectively. On the basis of these data we calculated the reserve of organic carbon in Siberian soils. It constitutes 199 x 10(9) t, or 13.1% of the total world pool. During the last century, the total loss of organic carbon from the plowed soils in Western Siberia amounted to 11.2 x 10(8) t, or 29% of the initial content. The losses induced by erosion and deflation reached 1.1 x 10(8) t, or 10% of the total loss. With the passage of time, the loss induced by mineralization decreases, whereas the soil erosion loss increases. Bog ecosystems of Western Siberia serve as sinks for carbon dioxide owing to the active accumulation of peat. Within the past century, the amount of carbon sequestered in peat deposits of Western Siberia has reached approximately 15 x 10(8) t, i.e., it is 1.5 times higher than the loss of organic carbon from the plowed soils within the same period.

AB Previous research showed that anaerobic respiration using iron (Fe) oxides as terminal electron acceptor contributed substantially to ecosystem respiration (ER) in a drained thaw lake basin (DTLB) on the Arctic coastal plain. As DTLBs age, the surface organic layer thickens, progressively burying the Fe-rich mineral layers. We therefore hypothesized that Fe(III) availability and Fe reduction would decline with basin age. We studied four DTLBs across an age gradient, comparing seasonal changes in the oxidation state of dissolved and extractable Fe pools and the estimated contribution of Fe reduction to ER. The organic layer thickness did not strictly increase with age for these four sites, though soil Fe levels decreased with increasing organic layer thickness. However, there were surprisingly high levels of Fe minerals in organic layers, especially in the ancient basin where cryoturbation may have transported Fe upward through the profile. Net reduction of Fe oxides occurred in the latter half of the summer and contributed an estimated 40-45% to ecosystem respiration in the sites with the thickest organic layers and 61-63% in the sites with the thinnest organic layers. All sites had high concentrations of soluble Fe(II) and Fe(III), explained by the presence of siderophores, and this pool became progressively more reduced during the first half of the summer. Redox titrations with humic acid (HA) extracts and chelated Fe support our view that this pattern indicates the reduction of HA during this interval. We conclude that Fe(III) and HA reductions contribute broadly to ER in the Arctic coastal plain.

AB The present study has been undertaken to observe the relative efficiency of removal of metanil yellow from its aqueous solution by using different adsorbents like fly ash and activated carbon produced from different sources i.e. coconut shell, mehagani saw dust, and rice husk. It has also been observed that the rate of adsorption is highly dependent on contact time, adsorbent dose, pH, and initial concentration of the dyestuff. Rate of removal has been observed to increase with increasing contact time and adsorbent dose but with decreasing initial concentration. Higher removal has been observed generally in acidic range. Adsorptions by the adsorbents under investigation follow the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models where Freundlich and Langmuir constants have also been determined at different temperatures. Isotherms have been used to obtain the thermodynamic parameters like free energy, enthalpy and entropy of adsorption. Kinetic studies showed that all the adsorbents follow first order adsorption rate model with respect to the dye solution concentration. Various kinetic parameters such as first order adsorption rate constant, mass-transfer co-efficient, pore-diffusion constant, and activation energy of adsorption were evaluated to establish the mechanism. Adsorption processes were found to be endothermic, spontaneous, and pore-diffusion controlled for all the adsorbents. Among the adsorbents used in this study, activated carbon produced from mehagani saw dust has been found to be the most effective, which remove almost 100% metanil yellow from its 1000ppm aqueous solution.

AB Peatlands store 30% of the world's terrestrial soil carbon (C) and those located at northern latitudes are expected to experience rapid climate warming. We monitored growing season carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes across a factorial design of in situ water table (control, drought, and flooded plots) and soil warming (control vs. warming via open top chambers) treatments for 2 years in a rich fen located just outside the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest in interior Alaska. The drought (lowered water table position) treatment was a weak sink or small source of atmospheric CO2 compared to the moderate atmospheric CO2 sink at our control. This change in net ecosystem exchange was due to lower gross primary production and light-saturated photosynthesis rather than increased ecosystem respiration. The flooded (raised water table position) treatment was a greater CO2 sink in 2006 due largely to increased early season gross primary production and higher light-saturated photosynthesis. Although flooding did not have substantial effects on rates of ecosystem respiration, this water table treatment had lower maximum respiration rates and a higher temperature sensitivity of ecosystem respiration than the control plot. Surface soil warming increased both ecosystem respiration and gross primary production by approximately 16% compared to control (ambient temperature) plots, with no net effect on net ecosystem exchange. Results from this rich fen manipulation suggest that fast responses to drought will include reduced ecosystem C storage driven by plant stress, whereas inundation will increase ecosystem C storage by stimulating plant growth.

AB Mid- to high-latitude peatlands are a major terrestrial carbon stock but become carbon sources during droughts, which are increasingly frequent as a result of climate warming. A critical question within this context is the sensitivity to drought of peatland microbial food webs. Microbiota drive key ecological and biogeochemical processes, but their response to drought is likely to impact these processes. Peatland food webs have, however, been little studied, especially the response of microbial predators. We studied the response of microbial predators (testate amoebae, ciliates, rotifers, and nematodes) living in Sphagnum moss carpet to droughts, and their influence on lower trophic levels and on related microbial enzyme activity. We assessed the impact of reduced water availability on microbial predators in two peatlands using experimental (Linje mire, Poland) and natural (Forbonnet mire, France) water level gradients, reflecting a sudden change in moisture regime (Linje), and a typically drier environment (Forbonnet). The sensitivity of different microbial groups to drought was size dependent; large sized microbiota such as testate amoebae declined most under dry conditions (-41% in Forbonnet and -80% in Linje). These shifts caused a decrease in the predator-prey mass ratio (PPMR). We related microbial enzymatic activity to PPMR; we found that a decrease in PPMR can have divergent effects on microbial enzymatic activity. In a community adapted to drier conditions, decreasing PPMR stimulated microbial enzyme activity, while in extreme drought experiment, it reduced microbial activity. These results suggest that microbial enzymatic activity resulting from food web structure is optimal only within a certain range of PPMR, and that different trophic mechanisms are involved in the response of peatlands to droughts. Our findings confirm the importance of large microbial consumers living at the surface of peatlands on the functioning of peatlands, and illustrate their value as early warning indicators of change.

AB Earth surface processes (ESPs) drive landscape development and ecosystem processes in high-latitude regions by creating spatially heterogeneous abiotic and biotic conditions. Ongoing global change may potentially alter the activity of ESPs through feedback on ground conditions, vegetation and the carbon cycle. Consequently, accurate modeling of ESPs is important for improving understanding of the current and future distributions of these processes. The aims of this study were to: (1) integrate climate and multiple local predictors to develop realistic ensemble models for the four key ESPs occurring at high latitudes (slope processes, cryoturbation, nivation and palsa mires) based on the outputs of 10 modern statistical techniques; (2) test whether models of ESPs are improved by incorporating topography, soil and vegetation predictors to climate-only models; (3) examine the relative importance of these variables in a multivariate setting. Overall, the models showed high transferability with the mean area under curve of a receiver operating characteristics (AUC) ranging from 0.83 to 0.96 and true skill statistics (TSS) from 0.52 to 0.87 for the most complex models. Even though the analyses highlighted the importance of the climate variables as the most influential predictors, three out of four models benefitted from the inclusion of local predictors. We conclude that disregarding local topography and soil conditions in spatial models of ESPs may cause a significant source of error in geomorphological distribution models.

AB Northern peatlands are a large repository of atmospheric carbon due to an imbalance between primary production by plants and microbial decomposition. The James Bay Lowlands (JBL) of northern Ontario are a large peatland-complex but remain relatively unstudied. Climate change models predict the region will experience warmer and drier conditions, potentially altering plant community composition, and shifting the region from a long-term carbon sink to a source. We collected a peat core from two geographically separated (ca. 200 km) ombrotrophic peatlands (Victor and Kinoje Bogs) and one minerotrophic peatland (Victor Fen) located near Victor Bog within the JBL. We characterized (i) archaeal, bacterial, and fungal community structure with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of ribosomal DNA, (ii) estimated microbial activity using community level physiological profiling and extracellular enzymes activities, and (iii) the aeration and temperature dependence of carbon mineralization at three depths (0-10, 50-60, and 100-110 cm) from each site. Similar dominant microbial taxa were observed at all three peatlands despite differences in nutrient content and substrate quality. In contrast, we observed differences in basal respiration, enzyme activity, and the magnitude of substrate utilization, which were all generally higher at Victor Fen and similar between the two bogs. However, there was no preferential mineralization of carbon substrates between the bogs and fens. Microbial community composition did not correlate with measures of microbial activity but pH was a strong predictor of activity across all sites and depths. Increased peat temperature and aeration stimulated CO2 production but this did not correlate with a change in enzyme activities. Potential microbial activity in the JBL appears to be influenced by the quality of the peat substrate and the presence of microbial inhibitors, which suggests the existing peat substrate will have a large influence on future JBL carbon dynamics.

AB Extreme climate events are observed and predicted to increase in frequency and duration in high-latitudeecosystems as a result of global climate change. This includes extreme precipitation events, which maydirectly impact on belowground food webs and ecosystem functioning by their physical impacts and byaltering local soil moisture conditions.
   We assessed responses of the Collembola community in a northern Sphagnum fuscum-dominatedombrotrophic peatland to three years of experimentally increased occurrence of extreme precipitationevents. Annual summer precipitation was doubled (an increase of 200 mm) by 16 simulated extremerain events within the three months growing season, where on each occasion 12.5 mm of rain was addedwithin a few minutes. Despite this high frequency and intensity of the rain events, no shifts in Collemboladensity, relative species abundances and community weighted means of three relevant traits (moisturepreference, vertical distribution and body size) were observed. This strongly suggests that the peatlandCollembola community is unaffected by the physical impacts of extreme precipitation and the short-termvariability in moisture conditions. The lack of response is most likely reinforced by the fact that extremeprecipitation events do not seem to alter longer-term soil moisture conditions in the peat layers inhabitedby soil fauna.
   This study adds evidence to the observation that the biotic components of northern ombrotrophicpeatlands are hardly responsive to an increase in extreme summer precipitation events. Given the importance of these ecosystems for the global C balance, these findings significantly contribute to the currentknowledge of the ecological impact of future climate scenarios.

AB Extreme climate events are predicted to become more frequent and intense. Their ecological impacts, particularly on carbon cycling, can differ in relation to ecosystem sensitivity. Peatlands, being characterized by peat accumulation under waterlogged conditions, can be particularly sensitive to climate extremes if the climate event increases soil oxygenation. However, a mechanistic understanding of peatland responses to persistent climate extremes is still lacking, particularly in terms of aboveground-belowground feedback. Here, we present the results of a transplantation experiment of peat mesocosms from high to low altitude in order to simulate, during 3years, a mean annual temperature c. 5 degrees C higher and a mean annual precipitation c. 60% lower. Specifically, we aim at understanding the intensity of changes for a set of biogeochemical processes and their feedback on carbon accumulation. In the transplanted mesocosms, plant productivity showed a species-specific response depending on plant growth forms, with a significant decrease (c. 60%) in peat moss productivity. Soil respiration almost doubled and Q(10) halved in the transplanted mesocosms in combination with an increase in activity of soil enzymes. Spectroscopic characterization of peat chemistry in the transplanted mesocosms confirmed the deepening of soil oxygenation which, in turn, stimulated microbial decomposition. After 3years, soil carbon stock increased only in the control mesocosms whereas a reduction in mean annual carbon accumulation of c. 30% was observed in the transplanted mesocosms. Based on the above information, a structural equationmodel was built to provide a mechanistic understanding of the causal connections between peat moisture, vegetation response, soil respiration and carbon accumulation. This study identifies, in the feedback between plant and microbial responses, the primary pathways explaining the reduction in carbon accumulation in response to recurring climate extremes in peat soils.

AB The near-pristine bog ecosystems of Tierra del Fuego in southernmost Patagonia have so far not been studied in terms of their current carbon dioxide (CO2) sink strength. CO2 flux data from Southern Hemisphere peat-lands are scarce in general. In this study, we present CO2 net ecosystem exchange (NEE) fluxes from two Fuegian bog ecosystems with contrasting vegetation communities. One site is located in a glaciogenic valley and developed as a peat moss-dominated raised bog, and the other site is a vascular plant-dominated cushion bog located at the coast of the Beagle Channel. We measured NEE fluxes with two identical eddy covariance (EC) setups at both sites for more than 2 years. With the EC method, we were able to observe NEE fluxes on an ecosystem level and at high temporal resolution. Using a mechanistic modeling approach, we estimated daily NEE models to gap fill and partition the half-hourly net CO2 fluxes into components related to photosynthetic uptake (gross primary production, GPP) and to total ecosystem respiration (TER). We found a larger relative variability of annual NEE sums between both years at the moss-dominated site. A warm and dry first year led to comparably high TER sums. Photosynthesis was also promoted by warmer conditions but less strongly than TER with respect to absolute and relative GPP changes. The annual NEE carbon (C) uptake was more than 3 times smaller in the warm year. Close to the sea at the cushion bog site, the mean temperature difference between both observed years was less pronounced, and TER stayed on similar levels. A higher amount of available radiation in the second observed year led to an increase in GPP (5 %) and NEE (35 %) C uptake. The average annual NEE-C uptake of the cushion bog (-122 +/- 76 gm(-2) a(-1), n = 2) was more than 4 times larger than the average uptake of the moss-dominated bog (-27 +/- 28 gm(-2) a(-1), n = 2).

ID BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; DAMPING-OFF; PATTERNS; ROT
AB In a commercial closed hydroponic greenhouse system, the microflora inhabiting the root and the nutrient solution of peat and rockwool grown tomato were studied on the basis of viable count (colony forming units, CFU), functional diversity using sole carbon source utilization (SCSU) patterns and taxonomic diversity using phospholipid fatty acid (PLEA) profiles. Sampling was done during one growing season, from May to October. Viable count of bacteria inhabiting the roots showed that the number of general bacterial flora and of fluorescent pseudomonads was higher in rockwool than peat while the amount of general fungal microflora, actinomycetes and Trichoderma was higher in peat than in rockwool grown tomato plants. For the irrigation effluent, no significant differences were found with respect to the general bacterial flora. The number of fluorescent pseudomonads decreased during the observation period whereas the number of actinomycetes rose towards the end of the experiment. For the general fungal flora and Trichoderma, viable counts showed significantly lower CFU for the samplings in August and September compared with the other sampling incidents. Furthermore, SCSU patterns and PLFA profiles showed differences in the root microflora with respect to growing medium and to sampling incidents. A separation of the microflora inhabiting the nutrient solution between the sampling incidents could also be done. This indicates that all three methods showed that the composition and the function of the microflora inhabiting the root and the nutrient solution shifted during the growing season and were different with respect to the growing medium.

AB Despite the importance of peatlands in the global carbon cycle, no widely applicable ecosystem model exists for peatlands. Simulations of three montane fens in Colorado. USA were conducted to test the capabilities of the CENTURY ecosystem model to simulate 1) long-term carbon accumulation and 2) short-term changes in carbon accumulation due to hydrologic changes. The CENTURY model was calibrated to simulate long-term carbon accumulation in two fens for up to 10.000 years by adjusting three variables that represent anaerobic soil conditions. CENTURY was unable to simulate long-term carbon accumulation in a third fen using settings for the two calibrated fens, However. CENTURY correctly simulated total carbon storage by adjusting two of the three anaerobic variables. A sensitivity analysis revealed that carbon accumulation in CENTURY is highly sensitive to anaerobic soil conditions. CENTURY predicted that half of the fen peat is composed of structural root material. The majority of the remaining peat was composed of recalcitrant slow and passive soil organic matter. Precipitation levels were altered to determine if CENTURY could predict the change in carbon accumulation rates due to periodic drier conditions. The simulated drying scenario predicted an average carbon loss of 70 g C m(-2) yr (1) during the 100-year simulation. The loss of carbon occurred despite plant production increasing from an average of 249 g C m (2) yr (1) to 391 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Slightly more than 90% of the carbon lost was from the structural root pool and slow organic matter pool, while there was no carbon loss or a slight net carbon gain in the passive organic matter pool and above-ground structural and metabolic pools. Despite several shortcomings, our results indicate that an ecosystem model, such as CENTURY, can be useful for simulating carbon dynamics in peatlands.

AB Mangrove trees may allocate >50% of their biomass to roots. Dead roots often form peat, which can make mangroves significant carbon sinks and allow them to raise the soil surface and thus survive rising sea levels. Understanding mangrove root production and decomposition is hence of theoretical and applied importance. The current work explored the effects of species, site, and root size and root nutrients on decomposition. Decomposition of fine (<= 3 mm diameter) and coarse (>3 mm diameter, up to a maximum of similar to 9 mm) roots from three mangrove species, Avicennia marina, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and Ceriops tagal was measured over 12 months at 6 sites along a tidal gradient in Gazi Bay, Kenya. C:N and P: N ratios in fresh and decomposed roots were measured, and the effects on decomposition of root size and age, of mixing roots from A. marina and C. tagal, of enriching B. gymnorrhiza roots with N and P and of artefacts caused by bagging roots were recorded. There were significant differences between species, with 76, 47 and 44 % mean dry weight lost after one year for A. marina, B. gymnorrhiza and C. tagal respectively, and between sites, with generally slower decomposition at dryer, high tidal areas. N enriched B. gymnorrhiza roots decomposed significantly faster than un-enriched controls; there was no effect of P enrichment. Mixing A. marina and C. tagal roots caused significantly enhanced decomposition in C togal. These results suggest that N availability was an important determinant of decomposition, since differences between species reflected the initial C: N ratios. The relatively slow decomposition rates recorded concur with other studies, and may overestimate natural rates, since larger (10-20 mm diameter), more mature and un-bagged roots all showed significantly slower rates.

AB Experiments were performed to investigate tar formation during devolatilization of black liquor at high heating rates, at temperatures from 700 to 1000 degreesC and 1 bar of total pressure. The tar compounds detected were grouped into two categories, semivolatiles and nonvolatiles, based on their molecular weights and boiling points. The semivolatile tar collected ranged from 0.1% to 5% of the carbon in black liquor, while the nonvolatile tar collected ranged from 0.02 to 1%. However, carbon balances suggested that tar may have accounted for 20% or more of the carbon in black liquor at 900 degreesC and below. Tar characterization revealed a similarity between the lignin substructure and some of the tar compounds produced. This indicates that kraft lignin was the source of these tar compounds. Tar yields were controlled by a number of competitive formation and decomposition reactions, which are influenced by the residence time, temperature, and gas composition. Low temperatures favored the formation of more aromatic tar species with diversified substituted groups such as toluene and xylenes. These compounds were formed at a finite rate, and their concentrations were increased with gas/particle residence time. Tar species formed more rapidly and decomposed more rapidly at higher temperatures. Nonsubstituted aromatics such as benzene were more stable at higher temperatures and were formed by decomposition of substituted aromatics. Oxidizing gases enhanced both the formation and destruction of tar species, depending on the temperature and residence time.

AB Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from a 1700-year-old wooden spear shaft, excavated from an archaeological site that dates from the iron age, in the southern part of Jutland, Denmark. The bacteria were cultivated in glucose- and xylose-supplemented media at 14degreesC and 20degreesC. A gene library with 21 clones was constructed by extracting and amplifying 16S rDNA sequences from the individual cultures. One clone was phylogenetically affiliated to the Spirochaeta. Eleven clones affiliated to an unidentified member of the alpha-Proteobacteria were present in all culture samples. Three clones were affiliated to the beta-Proteobacteria. Four clones were clustered among the Geobacteriaceae, in the delta-Proteobacteria. A single clone was clustered with gram-positives. All the identified bacterial families are commonly found in soil or bog environments and many are able to utilize cellulose as their carbon or energy source. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hopanoids are lipids that are widespread in the bacterial domain and well established molecular biomarkers in modern and paleo environments. In particular, the occurrence of C-13-depleted 3-methylated hopanoids are characteristic of aerobic bacteria involved in methane oxidation. Previously the intra-aerobic methanotroph 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera' ('Ca. M. oxyfera'), which performs nitrite-dependent methane oxidation in anoxic environments, has been shown to synthesize bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs) and their 3-methylated counterparts. However, since 'Ca. M. oxyfera' does not utilize methane as a carbon source, its biomass and lipids do not show the characteristic C-13-depletion. Therefore, the detection of 'Ca. M. oxyfera' in various environments is challenging, and still underexplored. Here, we re-investigated the hopanoid content of 'Ca. M. oxyfera' bacteria using enrichment cultures. We found the GC-amenable hopanoids of 'Ca. M. oxyfera' to be dominated by four demethylated hopanoids of which only one, 22,29,30-trisnorhopan-21-one, had been identified previously. The three novel hopanoids were tentatively identified as 22,29,30-trisnorhopan-21-ol, 3-methyl-22,29,30-trisnor hopan-21-one and 3-methyl-22,29,30-trisnorhopan-21-ol. These unique demethylated hopanoids are most likely biosynthesized directly by 'Ca. M. oxyfera' bacteria. Bioinformatical analysis of the 'Ca. M. oxyfera' genome revealed potential candidate genes responsible for the demethylation of hopanoids. For the sensitive detection of the four trisnorhopanoid biomarkers in environmental samples, a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method was developed and used to successfully detect the trisnorhopanoids in a peatland where the presence of 'Ca. M. oxyfera' had been confirmed previously by DNA-based analyses. These new biomarkers may be a novel tool to trace nitrite-dependent methane oxidation in various (past) environments.

AB Over the next century, near-surface permafrost across the circumpolar Arctic is expected to degrade significantly. particularly for land areas south of 70 degrees N. This is likely to cause widespread impacts on arctic hydrology, ecology, and trace gas emissions. Here. we present a review of recent Studies investigating linkages between permafrost dynamics and river biogeochemistry in the Arctic, including consideration of likely impacts that warming-induced changes in permafrost may be having (or will have in the future) oil the delivery of organic matter, inorganic nutrients, and major ions to the Arctic Ocean. These interacting processes can be highly complex and undoubtedly exhibit spatial and temporal variabilities associated with current permafrost conditions, sensitivity to permafrost thaw, mode of permafrost degradation (overall permafrost thaw, active layer deepening, and/or thermokarst processes), and environmental characteristics of watersheds (e.g. land cover, soil type, and topography). One of the most profound consequences of permafrost thaw projected for the future is that the arctic terrestrial freshwater system is likely to experience a transition from a Surface water-dominated system to a groundwater-dominated system. Along with many other cascading impacts from this transition, mineral-rich groundwater may become an important contributor to streamflow, in addition to the currently dominant contribution from mineral-poor surface water. Most Studies observe or predict an increase in major ion, phosphate, and silicate export with this shift towards greater groundwater contributions. However, we see conflicting accounts of whether the delivery of inorganic nitrogen and organic matter will increase or decrease with warming and permafrost thaw. It is important to note that uncertainties in the predictions of the total flux of biogeochemical constituents are tightly linked to future uncertainties in discharge of rivers. Nonetheless, it is clear that over the next Century there will be important shifts in the river transport of organic matter, inorganic nutrients, and major ions. which may in turn have critical implications for primary production and carbon cycling oil arctic shelves and in the Arctic Ocean basin interior.

AB Measurements are presented of deltaC-13 values from nine Sphagnum species and associated vascular plants and peat from a wet heath in East Devon, from Sphagnum trinitense C. Mull. at different sites and heights above water level in a North Carolina lake, and from two Marchantialean and two Metzgerialean liverworts from various habitats. The terrestrial Sphagnum species show broadly similar deltaC-13 values. Species with photosynthetic cells enclosed by the hyaline cells on both surfaces have significantly lower deltaC-13 values (mean -27.12) than the other terrestrial species (mean -28.91).
   S. cuspidatum from a bog pool has a deltaC-13 of -34.70, very significantly more negative than the other sphagna, probably from a proportion of recycled CO2 in its source carbon.
   S. trinitense shows significant between-site and within-site variation in deltaC-13 in relation to height above water level. Samples at 6 cm give the most negative deltaC-13 values (mean -26.10), with progressively less negative values at lower levels (mean at 3 cm, -23.98; submerged, -22.55), implying increasing limitation of carbon uptake by diffusion resistance with increasing saturation and submersion.
   The four liverworts give similar deltaC-13 values. The slightly more negative figure for Aneura pinguis may reflect some uptake of recycled CO2; the figure for Pellia epiphylla is close to that for the two Marchantiales.
   Bryophytes have generally similar deltaC-13 values to C3 vascular plants, suggesting that their photosynthetic structures are functionally comparable to those of vascular plants, with similar relations between diffusive and biochemical limitations on the rate of carbon uptake. This probably results from similar selection pressures operating in the two groups. Relationships between structure, diffusion resistances and inorganic carbon acquisition in Sphagnum are discussed.

AB Sphagnum mosses are widespread in areas where mires exist and constitute a globally important carbon sink. Their ecophysiology is known to be related to the water level, but very little is currently known about the successional trend in Sphagnum. We hypothesized that moss species follow the known vascular plant growth strategy along the successional gradient (i.e., decrease in production and maximal photosynthesis while succession proceeds). To address this hypothesis, we studied links between the growth and related ecophysiological processes of Sphagnum mosses from a time-since-initiation chronosequence of five wetlands. We quantified the rates of increase in biomass and length of different Sphagnum species in relation to their CO2 assimilation rates, their photosynthetic light reaction efficiencies, and their physiological states, as measured by the chlorophyll fluorescence method. In agreement with our hypothesis, increase in biomass and CO2 exchange rate of Sphagnum mosses decreased along the successional gradient, following the tactics of more intensely studied vascular plants. Mosses at the young and old ends of the chronosequence showed indications of downregulation, measured as a low ratio between variable and maximum fluorescence (F (v)/F (m)). Our study divided the species into three groups; pioneer species, hollow species, and ombrotrophic hummock formers. The pioneer species S. fimbriatum is a ruderal plant that occurred at the first sites along the chronosequence, which were characterized by low stress but high disturbance. Hollow species are competitive plants that occurred at sites with low stress and low disturbance (i.e., in the wet depressions in the middle and at the old end of the chronosequence). Ombrotrophic hummock species are stress-tolerant plants that occurred at sites with high stress and low disturbance (i.e., at the old end of the chronosequence). The three groups along the mire successional gradient appeared to be somewhat analogous to the three primary strategies suggested by Grime.

AB Presumed source specificity of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) from bacteria thriving in soil/peat and isoprenoid GDGTs (iGDGTs) from aquatic organisms led to the development of several biomarker proxies for biogeochemical cycle and paleoenvironmental reconstructions. However, recent studies reveal that brGDGTs are also produced in aquatic environments besides soils and peat. Here we examined three cores from the Bohai Sea, and found distinct difference in brGDGT compositions varying with the distance from the Yellow River mouth. We thus propose an abundance ratio of hexamethylated to pentamethylated brGDGT (IIIa / IIa) to evaluate brGDGT sources. The compilation of globally distributed 1354 marine sediments and 589 soils shows that the IIIa / IIa ratio is generally < 0.59 in soils and 0.59-0.92 and > 0.92 in marine sediments with and without significant terrestrial inputs, respectively. Such disparity confirms the existence of two sources for brGDGTs, a terrestrial origin with lower IIIa / IIa and a marine origin with higher IIIa / IIa, which is likely attributed to a generally higher pH and the production of brGDGTs in cold deep water in marine waters. The application of the IIIa / IIa ratio to the East Siberian Arctic Shelf proves it to be a sensitive source indicator for brGDGTs, which is helpful for accurate estimation of organic carbon source and paleoclimates in marine settings.

AB The free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) and N deposition experiments on four ombrotrophic bogs in Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands and Switzerland, revealed that after three years of treatment: (1) elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration had no significant effect on the biomass growth of Sphagnum and vascular species; and (2) increased N deposition reduced Sphagnum growth, because it increased the cover of vascular plants and the tall moss Polytrichum strictum , while vascular plant biomass growth was not affected. This paper focuses on water chemistry, plant nutrient content, and litter decomposition rates. Potassium limitation, or low supply of K and P, may have prevented a significant increase of Sphagnum growth under elevated CO2 and N deposition. Vascular plant growth under elevated CO2 and N deposition was also limited by K, or by K in combination with P or N (N in CO2 experiment). Elevated CO2 and N deposition had no effect on decomposition rates of Sphagnum and vascular plant litter. Aside from a possible effect of N deposition on light competition between species, we expect that elevated atmospheric CO2 and N deposition concentrations will not affect Sphagnum and vascular plant growth in bogs of north-west Europe due to K-, or K in combination with N- or P-, limited growth. For the same reason we expect no effect of elevated CO2 and N deposition on litter decomposition. Net primary production of raised ombrotrophic bogs that are at or close to steady state, is regulated by input of nutrients through atmospheric deposition. Therefore, we hypothesize that the expected increase of plant growth under elevated CO2 and N deposition is diminished by current levels of K (and to some extent P and N) in atmospheric deposition.

AB The northern terrestrial net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) is contingent on inputs from vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) to offset the ecosystem respiration (R-eco) of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions, but an effective framework to monitor the regional Arctic NECB is lacking. We modified a terrestrial carbon flux (TCF) model developed for satellite remote sensing applications to evaluate wetland CO2 and CH4 fluxes over pan-Arctic eddy covariance (EC) flux tower sites. The TCF model estimates GPP, CO2 and CH4 emissions using in situ or remote sensing and reanalysis-based climate data as inputs. The TCF model simulations using in situ data explained >70% of the r(2) variability in the 8 day cumulative EC measured fluxes. Model simulations using coarser satellite (MODIS) and reanalysis (MERRA) Records accounted for approximately 69% and 75% of the respective r(2) variability in the tower CO2 and CH4 records, with corresponding RMSE uncertainties of <= 1.3 gCm(-2) d(-1) (CO2) and 18.2 mg Cm-2 d(-1) (CH4). Although the estimated annual CH4 emissions were small (<18 gCm(-2) yr(-1)) relative to R-eco (>180 gCm(-2) yr(-1)), they reduced the across-site NECB by 23% and contributed to a global warming potential of approximately 165 +/- 128 gCO(2)eqm(-2) yr(-1) when considered over a 100 year time span. This model evaluation indi-cates a strong potential for using the TCF model approach to document landscape-scale variability in CO2 and CH4 fluxes, and to estimate the NECB for northern peatland and tundra ecosystems.

AB The Temperate Highland Peat Swamps on Sandstone of the Sydney Basin occur in the headwaters of Sydney's drinking water catchments and are listed as endangered ecosystems, yet they have suffered habitat losses and degradation due to human impacts such as urbanisation. Despite ongoing efforts to restore and better protect upland swamps, they remain poorly understood, potentially hindering the effectiveness of management efforts. Essential to overall ecosystem function and the provision of services for human and environmental benefit are the microbial component of wetland ecosystems. In the case of these swamps, the microbes, have not yet been studied. Here, we investigated differences in the microbial community of upland swamps in urbanised catchments compared to swamps from natural catchments in the Blue Mountains. A total of twelve swamps were sampled, six from within urbanised catchments and six with intact vegetation catchments, to compare sediment conditions and microbial community and genes expression and abundances. Catchment impervious area and number of stormwater drains entering a swamp, indicators for urbanisation, positively correlated with the pH and ammonium concentration of swamp sediment. Community analysis of the 16S rRNA gene (T-RFLP, qPCR) revealed the elevated pH of urbanised swamps coincided with changes to the abundance of bacteria and archaea. Furthermore, RT-qPCR revealed genes involved in carbon cycling (mcrA & pmoA) were more likely to be found in urbanised swamps. Taken together, our results indicate that urbanisation of the Blue Mountains is impacting the environmental services provided by the microbial community of upland swamps in the Sydney Basin.

TI Soil organic matter characterization of temperate peatland soil with
   FTIR-spectroscopy: effects of mire type and drainage intensity
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article

AB Peatlands are an important component of the global carbon cycle because they comprise huge amounts of terrestrial carbon (C). Different conditions during peat formation and secondary peat decomposition affect the quantity and composition of soil organic matter (SOM) in peats. There are few comparative studies on the chemical composition of SOM in temperate peatland soil. This study investigates compositional changes of SOM functional groups in peats and corresponding peat-forming plants by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Three plant samples and 29 peat samples were taken from seven temperate peatland sites with different genesis and land-use intensity. Site-specific differences, such as genesis of the peat, were found to be reflected in the FTIR spectra. In general, there was more variation in FTIR spectra in samples from fens than in those from bogs and peat-forming plants. The samples from fens have a smaller C-H absorption band than those from bogs and plants, which reflects greater biochemical activity in the minerotrophic than ombrotrophic environments. In addition to peat genesis, drainage and secondary peat decomposition also affect SOM composition substantially. The larger amounts of aliphatic compounds in undrained peats could be explained by selective preservation caused by anaerobic conditions. With increasing drainage of the sites, there was a decrease in the C-H absorption that was accompanied by a relative increase in C=O absorption. These changes in absorption intensities reflect the enhanced aerobic decomposition and mineralization that accompanies drainage and land-use intensity. However, the degree of peat decomposition', a diagnostic tool used in the field, is not reflected by OM composition determined by FTIR spectroscopy. Our results contribute to further understanding of changes in SOM composition during peat formation and processes of secondary decomposition caused by drainage.

AB Installation of biobed biopurification systems at farm level, traditionally composed of soil, peat and straw, to reduce point source contamination is difficult in some countries where peat is not environmentally or economically feasible. This study evaluates the use of local organic wastes from olive oil production such as wet olive cake and its vermicompost as substitutes of peat and olive tree pruning as substitute of straw to perform robust biobeds capable of removing mixtures of pesticides at high concentrations. Adsorption capacity of the novel biomixtures was comparable to or higher than traditional one. The biomixture with soil and olive tree pruning showed the highest pesticides adsorption, except for imidacloprid. The biomixture with soil, vermicompost and olive tree pruning showed dissipation efficiency of dimethoate, imidacloprid and oxyfluorfen (> 73%) higher than traditional biobed. Meanwhile, the biomixture with soil and vermicompost was the alternative biomixture with the highest dissipation of diuron (54%) and tebuconazole (35%) but it was lower than traditional biomixture (59 and 47% for diuron and tebuconazole, respectively). The low dissipation of these compounds (< 60%) is probably due to competitive and/or inhibitory phenomena between the pesticides in the mixture. Labile organic compounds from biomixture components such as water-soluble carbon constitute a more available carbon source for microorganisms that may counteracted the negative impact of high pesticide load on biomixture microbial populations, but they may have limited the pesticides dissipation. Novel biomixtures composed of olive oil mill waste may be a sustainable and less expensive alternative to traditional biomixture.

AB Carbon dynamics of temperate peat swamps are a largely understudied component of wetland carbon cycling. Under a changing climate, hydrometeorological conditions may change, and understanding how peat swamps may be impacted is important. We investigated the importance of hydrogeomorphic setting on controlling soil carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes from a temperate peat swamp in southern Ontario, Canada over a 3-year period. We chose three different hydrogeomorphic settings: (a) a site with strong wetland-stream interactions (i.e., an unconfined stream channel; unconfined), (b) a site with limited wetland-stream interactions (confined), and (c) an interior site (no wetland-stream interaction). The differing hydrogeomorphic conditions between the sites resulted in differences in carbon fluxes. The unconfined site maintained a higher water table across all three study years, providing conditions that are not favourable to CO2 production. The confined and interior sites sustained a much lower water table, with conditions more conducive to CO2 efflux. The unconfined site also had the highest CH4 emissions due to the increased anoxic conditions favourable for CH4 production as a result of the higher water table position. Hydrogeomorphic setting was found to be important for understanding within site variation, suggesting the sites may respond differently to longer-term shifts in environmental conditions. This may change relationships between sites if the responses are strong enough to significantly alter carbon fluxes, decomposition, and potential peat accumulation rates. It is important to understand the locally specific responses to environmental conditions within peat swamp ecosystems, in order to make future predictions about whole ecosystem function under changing conditions.

   Holocene epoch

AB Thermokarst lakes formed across vast regions of Siberia and Alaska during the last deglaciation and are thought to be a net source of atmospheric methane and carbon dioxide during the Holocene epoch(1-4). However, the same thermokarst lakes can also sequester carbon(5), and it remains uncertain whether carbon uptake by thermokarst lakes can offset their greenhouse gas emissions. Here we use field observations of Siberian permafrost exposures, radiocarbon dating and spatial analyses to quantify Holocene carbon stocks and fluxes in lake sediments overlying thawed Pleistocene-aged permafrost. We find that carbon accumulation in deep thermokarst-lake sediments since the last deglaciation is about 1.6 times larger than the mass of Pleistocene-aged permafrost carbon released as greenhouse gases when the lakes first formed. Although methane and carbon dioxide emissions following thaw lead to immediate radiative warming, carbon uptake in peat-rich sediments occurs over millennial timescales. We assess thermokarst-lake carbon feedbacks to climate with an atmospheric perturbation model and find that thermokarst basins switched from a net radiative warming to a net cooling climate effect about 5,000 years ago. High rates of Holocene carbon accumulation in 20 lake sediments (47 +/- 10 grams of carbon per square metre per year; mean +/- standard error) were driven by thermokarst erosion and deposition of terrestrial organic matter, by nutrient release from thawing permafrost that stimulated lake productivity and by slow decomposition in cold, anoxic lake bottoms. When lakes eventually drained, permafrost formation rapidly sequestered sediment carbon. Our estimate of about 160 petagrams of Holocene organic carbon in deep lake basins of Siberia and Alaska increases the circumpolar peat carbon pool estimate for permafrost regions by over 50 per cent (ref. 6). The carbon in perennially frozen drained lake sediments may become vulnerable to mineralization as permafrost disappears(7-9), potentially negating the climate stabilization provided by thermokarst lakes during the late Holocene.

AB Shifts in vegetation phenology are a key example of the biological effects of climate change(1-3). However, there is substantial uncertainty about whether these temperature-driven trends will continue, or whether other factors-for example, photoperiod-will become more important as warming exceeds the bounds of historical variability(4,5). Here we use phenological transition dates derived from digital repeat(5) photography(6) to show that experimental whole-ecosystem warming treatments(7) of up to +9 degrees C linearly correlate with a delayed autumn green-down and advanced spring green-up of the dominant woody species in a boreal Picea-Sphagnum bog. Results were confirmed by direct observation of both vegetative and reproductive phenology of these and other bog plant species, and by multiple years of observations. There was little evidence that the observed responses were constrained by photoperiod. Our results indicate a likely extension of the period of vegetation activity by 1-2 weeks under a 'CO2 stabilization' climate scenario (+2.6 +/- 0.7 degrees C), and 3-6 weeks under a 'high-CO2 emission' scenario (+5.9 +/- 1.1 degrees C), by the end of the twenty-first century. We also observed severe tissue mortality in the warmest enclosures after a severe spring frost event. Failure to cue to photoperiod resulted in precocious green-up and a premature loss of frost hardiness(8), which suggests that vulnerability to spring frost damage will increase in a warmer world(9,10). Vegetation strategies that have evolved to balance tradeoffs associated with phenological temperature tracking may be optimal under historical climates, but these strategies may not be optimized for future climate regimes. These in situ experimental results are of particular importance because boreal forests have both a circumpolar distribution and a key role in the global carbon cycle(11).

AB Mapping the spatial and temporal changes of peatland in farming systems is crucial to the study of soil quality and productivity and the modeling of the global carbon cycle (in relation to climate change). This study compiles a contemporary map (2010) of peatland coverage (according to Kyoto protocol) across the cultivated wetlands of Denmark and compares this actual map to a historical 1975 peat coverage map using simple indicator kriging. For the contemporary peatland mapping, extensive soil sampling databases consisting of 42,568 points with 32,817 historical samples and 9,751 contemporary samples were used. These databases contain partly categorical information on parent material (organic [peat, gytje] and mineral [sand, silt and clay]) and partly continuous data (soil organic carbon, in %) reclassified into organic and mineral soils (using 12% soil organic carbon as a cutoff value). In the simple indicator kriging procedure, the values 0 and 1 were assigned to the stationary means of the indicator codes to represent two hypotheses, that is, mineral and organic (peat) soils, respectively. The collected and analyzed contemporary unbiased organic samples (measured on different rectangular grid scales of 250, 275, and 500 m) in addition to some transformed historical organic samples (according to certain decision rules) were used to estimate the recent areal coverage of peat (2010) that was equivalent to 70,176 ha, and this estimate corresponds to an indicator kriging probability of 0.35. Results revealed there has been a total areal coverage loss of 35% (37,786 ha) of the Danish organic cultivated wetlands during a period of 35 years (map 1975 had 107,962-ha coverage of peat). The peat depletion is related to peat mining and agricultural drainage/tillage activities, rather than natural geological processes.

TI Transformation of Peat Horizon in Swampy Southern Taiga Forests under
   the Impact of Surface Drainage
SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE swampy forests; peat thickness; pool of organic matter; surface drainage
ID ECOSYSTEMS
AB The results of stationary studies of swampy southern taiga forests in Yaroslavl oblast are presented. Estimates of changes in the thickness of peat horizon in peat podzolic gley soils (Folic Albeluvisols) of forests subjected to clearcutting and further intensive forest management in the past 30 years are given. The mean annual precipitation in these three decades has been 116 mm higher than that during the preceding three decades, which has led to a progressive swamping of spruce stands on heavy loamy soils within virtually flat (with slopes up to 0.0035) surfaces and an increase in the organic matter storage in the peat soil horizon with the mean annual rate of 22-68 g/m(2). On more pronounced slopes (0.0050), no swamping of spruce and pine stands growing on sandy soils has taken place. Surface drainage of swampy forests through the network of shallow ditches has led to an increase in the productivity of forests; in most cases, the pool of organic matter in the peat horizon has been decreasing with the mean annual rate of 32-46 g/m(2). This attests to the reversible character of swamping in dependence on climatic fluctuations and forestry measures. Changes in the carbon pool of swampy soils during short (several years) excessively wet or excessively dry periods may be significantly higher than the average values for 30 years in different types of forests. This allows us to consider swampy forests as the source of significant errors in the estimates of the current contribution of biota to the carbon cycle, because their role (as well as the role of other forests) is assessed without taking into account considerable short-term fluctuations in the carbon pool of their soils.

AB As a significant fraction of carbon in inland waters, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays a crucial role in carbon cycling at a global scale. Understanding the linkages between variations in DOC and its dominant factors in lakes is critical for estimating its concentration on a larger scale. This study characterized the concentrations of DOC in the lakes of Tibet Plateau and explored the major underlying influencing factors. The overall mean concentration of DOC in these closed lakes had a mean value of 21.80 +/- 30.82 mg/L (mean +/- S.D.) and was higher than open lakes (F = 174.1, p < 0.05). The potential drivers for the concentration of DOC in the lakes of Tibet Plateau were conducted by the correlation analysis of DOC with the observed landscape, water quality variables, and climatic factors. The multiple regression model showed that 78% of DOC concentrations across the lakes could be explained by Shannon evenness index (SHEI) of landscape, slope, and landscape dominance index (LDI), of which SHEI explained the most substantial variations for the concentration of DOC. The changes in the concentrations of DOC in river-lake interaction were analyzed in Qinghai Lake watershed. The concentration of DOC in the Qinghai Lake water was higher than the surrounding rivers. Slope and the density of soil organic matter (SOM) in the Qinghai Lake watershed were responsible for the higher DOC in lake than rivers. The landscape had a significant influence on DOC in the lakes, and the dominant factor was SHEI. The results observed from this investigation further supplement the information of DOC in the inland waters with plateau lakes. Further, this study is expected to improve the understanding of the transport of DOC in the river-lake ecosystem.

AB Northern peatlands contain up to 20% of the similar to 3000 Pg of global soil organic carbon. Carbon-rich peatlands cover upwards of 65% of the landscape in northern Canada where resource extraction activities disturb both the carbon pools and the future carbon sequestration capacity of the landscape. Previous estimates of the carbon losses from this disturbance predict a complete loss of the region's peatland carbon pool. Mining industries operating in these sensitive environments have recently begun constructing closure landscapes which are intended to develop carbon cycle processes similar to undisturbed northern peatlands. This study investigates eddy covariance fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) at one of Canada's first fully constructed boreal plains watersheds, the Sandhill Fen Watershed. During the first three years since inception, only the lowland region had an annual net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) indicative of increasing CO2 sink potential. The lowland region was characterized by saturated salvaged peat soils, standing water, thriving communities of Typha and Carex spp. and was a net CO2 sink of 77 g C m(-2) in the third year. At the same time the upland and the midland regions characterized by moist salvaged peat soils and a mix of herbaceous, shrub and planted Picea glauca and Pinus banksiana remained net sources of CO2. Despite similar rates of gross primary production, ecosystem and plot-level respiration rates in the lowland were significantly lower than in the midland region, likely due to very low reduction potentials within the lowland's saturated soils. With no other significant outflows of carbon, the lowland of the Sandhill Fen Watershed may be in the early stages of organic matter accumulation. Due to limited oxidation of the salvaged peat substrate in the lowland region, wetland reclamation employing these techniques may reduce the disturbance loss of the carbon pool in the boreal plains.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations have been measured in the waters of a semiarid freshwater wetland, the Tablas de Daimiel, Spain, when the system-characterised by variable hydroperiodicity conditions, was completely flooded (February 2011). Fluxes of DOM from the wetland soils to the overlying waters were measured by using a passive diffusion sampler (peeper). Not only dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were measured but refractory organic matter (ROM, usually known as humic substances) was also quantified using a novel voltammetric method. Fluorescence spectra were recorded to help in selecting the appropriate standard for ROM quantification, test the homogeneity of DOM in the waters and get an indication of their source. The results obtained show a 7-fold increase in measured ROM concentrations from the Giguela River to the outlet, which points to a net exportation of ROM from the wetland and to the existence of an internal source of ROM in the system, probably diffusion from the wetland soils. This hypothesis is confirmed by the flux of ROM from the soils to the water column measured with the peeper and by the common fluorescence characteristics of column and interstitial waters. The smaller increase in DOC concentrations along the wetland, in spite of the higher DOC fluxes from soils, suggests that there is significant turnover of organic carbon (OC) in the water column. The system acts as a major carbon sink but, when flooded, exports,OC as DOM.

AB Peatlands occupy a relatively small fraction of the Earth's land area, but they are a globally important carbon store because of their high carbon density. Undisturbed peatlands are currently a weak carbon sink (similar to 0.1 Pg C y(-1)), a moderate source of methane (CH4; similar to 0.03 Pg CH4 y(-1)), and a very weak source of nitrous oxide (N2O; similar to 0.00002 Pg N2O-N y(-1)). Anthropogenic disturbance, primarily agriculture and forestry drainage (10%-20% of global peatlands), results in net CO2 emissions, reduced CH4 emissions, and increased N2O emissions. This likely changes the global peatland greenhouse gas balance to a C source (similar to 0.1 Pg C y(-1)), a 10% smaller CH4 source, and a larger (but still small) N2O source (similar to 0.0004 Pg N2O-N y(-1)). There is no strong evidence that peatlands significantly contributed to 20th century changes in the atmospheric burden of CO2, CH4, or N2O; will this picture change in the 21st century? A review of experimental and observational studies of peatland dynamics indicates that the main global change impacts on peatlands that may have significant climate impacts are (1) drainage, especially in the tropics; (2) widespread permafrost thaw; and (3) increased fire intensity and frequency as a result of drier climatic conditions and (or) drainage. Quantitative estimates of global change impacts are limited by the sparse field data (particularly in the tropics), the large variability present in existing data, uncertainties in the future trajectory of peatland use, interactive effects of individual impacts, and the unprecedented rates of climate change expected in the 21st century.

AB Hydrogeologic setting strongly influences the hydrologic function of peatland systems. For base-rich fens in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) of the Western Boreal Plain, northern Alberta, local groundwater flow from gently sloping adjacent uplands has been shown to help sustain fen water tables and chemistry. Natural forest disturbance in the AOSR is dominated by wildfire, with peatlands susceptible to combustion and subsequent carbon release. However, few studies have aimed to characterize the degree of change to the hydrophysical properties of upland soils following wildfire. To address this, we measured differences in water repellency and hydrophysical properties of burned and unburned upland organic and mineral soils in a burned moderate-rich fen watershed (Poplar Fen), similar to 25 km north of Fort McMurray. Samples were taken in the fall of 2017, similar to 1.5 years after the watershed burned (May 2016). Study locations included burned and unburned jack pine-dominated upland and black spruce-dominated riparian areas. Results illustrated significantly lower water repellency and higher infiltration on burned locations of both land types. Furthermore, no significant differences were detected in organic soil moisture retention in uplands; however, burned organic soil samples had significantly lower water retention in riparian areas. We postulate the lower water retention in riparian areas was due to the greater organic layer thickness there, thus greater fuel load and potential for exceeding the temperature threshold of repellency destruction. Following retention, all soil cores exhibited high hysteresis, with differences in volumetric moisture content averaging 0.38 and 0.34 m(3) m(-3) at -10 cm pressure for upland and riparian locations, respectively. Our results are contrary to the increased hydrophobicity following burning that is commonly reported in boreal regions. The promoted infiltration, groundwater recharge and subsequent enhanced water supply to fens in the local groundwater system may help in accelerating the moss recovery process.

AB Production of soil gases is important in nutrient and carbon cycling, particularly in peatlands due to their large atmospheric emissions of several greenhouse gases. We examined factors controlling aerobic and anaerobic soil respiration in three contrasting types of freshwater North Carolina peatland communities (short pocosins, tall pocosins and gum swamps) which occur along a natural soil nutrient availability gradient. Short pocosins occur in the ombrotrophic center of the bog complexes and are extremely nutrient-deficient; tall pocosins are slightly less nutrient-deficient; and gum swamps are relatively nutrient-rich. Short pocosin had the lowest soil CO2 production rates under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in laboratory experiments, while rates in tall pocosin were similar to or somewhat less than in the gum swamp. Methanogenesis rates were extremely low in laboratory experiments, and indicate that CH4 production is not a significant pathway of carbon flow in these peatlands. Methane production is also low in relation to other peatlands. Amendment experiments indicate that the poor substrate quality of the highly decomposed, humified peat limits both CO2 and CH4 production rates, even though the peat is 95% organic matter. Low soil nutrient concentrations and low pH do not directly limit soil respiration in these peatlands, although there is a positive feedback of nutrients with organic matter inputs and litter quality, causing greater soil respiration in nutrient-rich sites.
   In situ CO2 emissions similarly differed between the communities, with highest rates in the gum swamp and lowest rates in the pocosins. Emissions were highly seasonal with soil temperature explaining the majority of the temporal variability. Maximum potential CH, emission estimates derived from laboratory temperature relationships and in situ soil temperature data indicate that pocosins make an insignificant contribution to the global atmospheric CH4 flux. The continued existence of peatlands in warm climates may to a large extent depend on the low substrate quality of their soil organic matter, which maintains low decomposition rates under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

AB An aliphatic aromatic copolyester, poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) is a chemically synthetic and biodegradable polymer that exhibits good mechanical properties, similar to those of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and can be a replacement for LDPE as biodegradable mulch films in the agricultural field. Biodegradability of PBAT is stable at high temperature conditions (50 - 60 degrees C) such as compost environments compared to mild temperature conditions (25 - 37 degrees C) such as soil environments. Considering that PBAT could be used in biodegradable agricultural applications such as mulching film, it is important to investigate the biodegradation mechanism at mild temperatures. In this study, a PEAT-degrading bacterium isolated from a soil environment, designated as strain NKCM 2511, was studied in detail. Genetic and biochemical analysis revealed that the strain belongs to the genus Rhodococcus in the phylum Actinobacteria. The strain grew only in aerobic conditions and formed a clear zone on a PBAT containing plate in the temperature range of 20 degrees C to 30 degrees C. Based on biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) biodegradation testing, among 3 PBAT components, adipicacid and terephthalic acid resulted in low growth rate of the strains (5 % and 7 %, incubated at 25 degrees C for 20 days), whereas 1,4-butanediol resulted in good growth of the strains (55 %). The low BOD biodegradation rate of PBAT by this strain (7 %) may be due to such low rates of terephthalic and adipic acid. Additionally, the PEAT degradation rate was proportional to the growth rate in the presence of various carbon sources. Therefore, the strain was an aerobically mesophilic PBAT-degrading bacterium that expressed the PBAT-degrading enzyme constitutively. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a PBAT-degrading actinobacterial strain in mild conditions. This study provides information to better understand the biodegradation mechanism of PBAT under mild conditions such as in fields. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mitigating and adapting to global changes requires a better understanding of the response of the Biosphere to these environmental variations. Human disturbances and their effects act in the long term (decades to centuries) and consequently, a similar time frame is needed to fully understand the hydrological and biogeochemical functioning of a natural system. To this end, the 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique' (CNRS) promotes and certifies long-term monitoring tools called national observation services or 'Service National d'Observation' (SNO) in a large range of hydrological and biogeochemical systems (e.g., cryosphere, catchments, aquifers). The SNO investigating peatlands, the SNO 'Tourbieres', was certified in 2011 (). Peatlands are mostly found in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere and French peatlands are located in the southern part of this area. Thus, they are located in environmental conditions that will occur in northern peatlands in coming decades or centuries and can be considered as sentinels. The SNO Tourbieres is composed of four peatlands: La Guette (lowland central France), Landemarais (lowland oceanic western France), Frasne (upland continental eastern France) and Bernadouze (upland southern France). Thirty target variables are monitored to study the hydrological and biogeochemical functioning of the sites. They are grouped into four datasets: hydrology, fluvial export of organic matter, greenhouse gas fluxes and meteorology/soil physics. The data from all sites follow a common processing chain from the sensors to the public repository. The raw data are stored on an FTP server. After operator or automatic processing, data are stored in a database, from which a web application extracts the data to make them available (). Each year at least, an archive of each dataset is stored in Zenodo, with a digital object identifier (DOI) attribution ().

AB Since large areas of peatlands in China have been degraded or reclaimed to cropland in recent decades, the conversion of these croplands to wetlands and the restoration of degraded peatlands by means of engineering have been attracting increasing attention. Hydrologic mediation and plantation of dominant peatland species were implemented to determine the effects of these two artificial measures on revegetation and soil property improvement in paddy fields in the Changbai Mountains in Northeast China. The results showed that after a three-year restoration, compared to natural restoration treatment, planting of Carex schmidtii significantly reduced aboveground biomass by 45% (p < 0.05), increased root biomass by 53% (P < 0.05), increased the Shannon-Wiener Index by 17%, enhanced concentrations of total soil organic matter by 28% (P < 0.05), reduced topsoil bulk density by 40% (P < 0.05), and improved water retention capacity of the topsoil. These results demonstrate the ability of C. schmidtii to inhibit the growth of weeds and other nontarget species through competition, and to increase the amount of residual roots in soil due to its well-developed rhizomes. Aboveground biomass and total organic matter in hydrologic mediation were 38% lower and 37% higher than in the natural restoration treatment, respectively. However, annual precipitation in this area is 704.2 mm, higher than most other area in Northeast China, and the Shannon-Wiener Index and soil bulk density were 4% and 29% lower than in the natural restoration treatment, respectively. Furthermore, the combined application of these two measures resulted in 35% lower aboveground biomass, 22% higher Shannon-Wiener Index, 16% higher topsoil organic matter, and 27% lower bulk density than in the natural restoration treatment. However, the growth of C. schmidtii was inhibited due to the reduction in its survival rate and basal width growth rate. Our results suggest that planting C. schmidtii is an effective way to promote the restoration of degraded peatland and enhance its carbon sink function in the Changbai Mountains. On the other hand, implementation of hydrologic mediation is not recommended for this rain-rich region. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Continued warming of the Arctic may cause permafrost to thaw and speed the decomposition of large stores of soil organic carbon (OC), thereby accentuating global warming. However, it is unclear if recent warming has raised the current rates of permafrost OC release to anomalous levels or to what extent soil carbon release is sensitive to climate forcing. Here we use a time series of radiocarbon age-offsets (C-14) between the bulk lake sediment and plant macrofossils deposited in an arctic lake as an archive for soil and permafrost OC release over the last 14,500 years. The lake traps and archives OC imported from the watershed and allows us to test whether prior warming events stimulated old carbon release and heightened age-offsets. Today, the age-offset (2ka; thousand of calibrated years before A.D. 1950) and the depositional rate of ancient OC from the watershed into the lake are relatively low and similar to those during the Younger Dryas cold interval (occurring 12.9-11.7ka). In contrast, age-offsets were higher (3.0-5.0ka) when summer air temperatures were warmer than present during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (11.7-9.0ka) and BOlling-AllerOd periods (14.5-12.9ka). During these warm times, permafrost thaw contributed to ancient OC depositional rates that were similar to 10 times greater than today. Although permafrost OC was vulnerable to climate warming in the past, we suggest surface soil organic horizons and peat are presently limiting summer thaw and carbon release. As a result, the temperature threshold to trigger widespread permafrost OC release is higher than during previous warming events.

AB Peatlands store globally significant amounts of carbon and are important sources of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. However, for reasons which are not well understood, many peatland soils produce smaller amounts of CH4 than theoretically predicted, and carbon dioxide (CO2) produced during anaerobic decomposition in peatland soils cannot be accounted for by commonly measured microbial processes. Here we show that the reduction of solid-phase organic matter (i.e., humic substances) suppresses CH4 production in a bog soil and can be responsible for 33-61% of the total carbon mineralization in this soil. These results demonstrate that the reduction of organic matter is a key component of anaerobic decomposition in peatlands, and is at least partially responsible for their low CH4 production. Thus, organic matter reduction may be a key regulator of how peatlands respond to ongoing global change.

AB It is important to understand the fate of carbon in boreal peatland soils in response to climate change because a substantial change in release of this carbon as CO2 and CH4 could influence the climate system. The goal of this research was to synthesize the results of a field water table manipulation experiment conducted in a boreal rich fen into a process-based model to understand how soil organic carbon (SOC) of the rich fen might respond to projected climate change. This model, the peatland version of the dynamic organic soil Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (peatland DOS-TEM), was calibrated with data collected during 2005-2011 from the control treatment of a boreal rich fen in the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX). The performance of the model was validated with the experimental data measured from the raised and lowered water-table treatments of APEX during the same period. The model was then applied to simulate future SOC dynamics of the rich fen control site under various CO2 emission scenarios. The results across these emissions scenarios suggest that the rate of SOC sequestration in the rich fen will increase between year 2012 and 2061 because the effects of warming increase heterotrophic respiration less than they increase carbon inputs via production. However, after 2061, the rate of SOC sequestration will be weakened and, as a result, the rich fen will likely become a carbon source to the atmosphere between 2062 and 2099. During this period, the effects of projected warming increase respiration so that it is greater than carbon inputs via production. Although changes in precipitation alone had relatively little effect on the dynamics of SOC, changes in precipitation did interact with warming to influence SOC dynamics for some climate scenarios.

ID BLACK SPRUCE; FIRE; SEVERITY; PATTERNS
AB The influence of discontinuous permafrost on ground-fuel storage, combustion losses, and postfire soil climates was examined after a wildfire near Delta Junction, AK in July 1999. At this site, we sampled soils from a four-way site comparison of burning (burned and unburned) and permafrost (permafrost and nonpermafrost). Soil organic layers (which comprise ground-fuel storage) were thicker in permafrost than nonpermafrost soils both in burned and unburned sites. While we expected fire severity to be greater in the drier site (without permafrost), combustion losses were not significantly different between the two burned sites. Overall, permafrost and burning had significant effects on physical soil variables. Most notably, unburned permafrost sites with the thickest organic mats consistently had the coldest temperatures and wettest mineral soil, while soils in the burned nonpermafrost sites were warmer and drier than the other soils. For every centimeter of organic mat thickness, temperature at 5 cm depth was about 0.5 degrees C cooler during summer months. We propose that organic soil layers determine to a large extent the physical and thermal setting for variations in vegetation, decomposition, and carbon balance across these landscapes. In particular, the deep organic layers maintain the legacies of thermal and nutrient cycling governed by fire and revegetation. We further propose that the thermal influence of deep organic soil layers may be an underlying mechanism responsible for large regional patterns of burning and regrowth, detected in fractal analyses of burn frequency and area. Thus, fractal geometry can potentially be used to analyze changes in state of these fire prone systems.

AB We simulated the effect of prolonged dry summer periods by lowering the water table on three manipulation plots (D1-3) in a minerotrophic fen in southeastern Germany in three years (2006-2008). The water table at this site was lowered by drainage and by excluding precipitation; three nonmanipulated control plots (C1-3) served as a reference. We found no significant differences in soil respiration (R-Soil), gross primary production (GPP), or aboveground respiration (R-AG) between the C1-3 and D1-3 plots in any of the measurement years. The water table on the control plots was naturally low, with a median water table (2006-2008) of 8 cm below the surface, and even lower during summer when respiratory activity was highest, with median values (C1-3) between 11 and 19 cm below the surface. If it is assumed that oxygen availability in the uppermost 10 cm was not limited by the location of the water table, manipulative lowering of the water table most likely increased oxygen availability only in deeper peat layers where we expect R-Soil to be limited by poor substrate quality rather than anoxia. This could explain the lack of a manipulation effect. In a second approach, we estimated the influence of the water table on R-Soil irrespective of treatment. The results showed a significant correlation between R-Soil and water table, but with R-Soil decreasing at lower water tables rather than increasing. We thus conclude that decomposition in the litter layer is not limited by waterlogging in summer, and deeper peat layers bear no significant decomposition potential due to poor substrate quality. Consequently, we do not expect enhanced C losses from this site due to increasing frequency of dry summers. Assimilation and respiration of aboveground vegetation were not affected by water table fluctuations between 10 and >60 cm depth, indicating the lack of stress resulting from either anoxia (high water table) or drought (low water table).

AB To understand, model, and predict landscape evolution, ecosystem services, and hydrological processes, the availability of detailed observation-based soil data is extremely valuable. For the EstSoil-EH dataset, we synthesized more than 20 eco-hydrological variables on soil, topography, and land use for Estonia (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3473289, Kmoch et al., 2019a) as numerical and categorical values from the original Soil Map of Estonia, the Estonian 5m lidar DEM, Estonian Topographic Database, and EUSoilHydroGrids layers.
   The Soil Map of Estonia maps more than 750 000 soil units throughout Estonia at a scale of 1 : 10 000 and forms the basis for EstSoil-EH. It is the most detailed and information-rich dataset for soils in Estonia, with 75 % of mapped units smaller than 4.0 ha, based on Soviet-era field mapping. For each soil unit, it describes the soil type (i.e. soil reference group), soil texture, and layer information with a composite text code, which comprises not only the actual texture class, but also classifiers for rock content, peat soils, distinct compositional layers, and their depths. To use these as eco-hydrological process properties in modelling applications we translated the text codes into numbers. The derived parameters include soil layering, soil texture (clay, silt, and sand contents), coarse fragments, and rock content of the soil layers within the soil profiles. In addition, we aggregated and predicted physical variables related to water and carbon cycles (bulk density, hydraulic conductivity, organic carbon content, available water capacity).
   The methodology and dataset developed will be an important resource for the Baltic region, but possibly also for all other regions where detailed field-based soil mapping data are available. Countries like Lithuania and Latvia have similar historical soil records from the Soviet era that could be turned into value-added datasets such as the one we developed for Estonia.

AB We examined the aqueous and solid-phase biogeochemistry of three different types of northern peattand sediments (oligotrophic bog, beaver pond, and transition site) along a peatland transect in Ontario. Canada. Pore water concentrations (PH, Fe2+, Fe3+, SO42-. H2S, CH4. CO2 and fatty acids) were monitored seasonally, solid phase profiles (Fe(II), Fe(III), reduced inorganic sulfur) measured, and potential rates of CO2, CH4, Fe2+, and H2S production determined in slurries of peat. Dissolved CO2 (up to 6 mmol/L) and CH4 (up to 1 mmol/L) were the predominant species at all sites. In the acidic bog acetate (up to I mmol/L) and smaller quantities of propionate and butyrate were present in the pore water. Dissolved Fe2+ (<5-150 mumol/L), SO42-(10-50 mumol/L), and H,S (0 to lOpmoUL) concentrations were much lower in comparison. The Fe(II) production rates (0.6-7.2 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) were small compared to production rates of CO2 (38-46 mmol m(-2)d(-1)) and CH4 (14-29 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Low concentrations of reactive Fe(III) (5-75 mumol/g) suggested that the Fe(II) reduction rate was limited by reactive Fe(III). In slurries amended with sulfate (0.5 mM) the potential for sulfate reduction was substantial and rates of CH4 production decreased by 48-86%. The in situ accumulation of acetate, propionate and butyrate in the acidic bog was consistent with a lack of stimulation of CO, and CH4 production during anaerobic incubation amended with acetate. Despite differences between sites Fe reduction was overall of little significance for the carbon flow. Sulfate reduction might have been more important based on the results from the incubations. In the bog, the accumulation of acetate and propionate confirmed the decoupling of anaerobic metabolic processes and the important role of fatty acid dynamics in the carbon cycle of acidic northern peatlands.

AB Fen-bog succession is accompanied by strong increases of carbon accumulation rates. We tested the prevailing hypothesis that living Sphagna have extraordinarily high cation exchange capacity (CEC) and therefore acidify their environment by exchanging tissue-bound protons for basic cations in soil water. As Sphagnum invasion in a peatland usually coincides with succession from a brown moss-dominated alkaline fen to an acidic bog, the CEC of Sphagna is widely believed to play an important role in this acidification process. However, Sphagnum CEC has never been compared explicitly to that of a wide range of other bryophyte taxa. Whether high CEC directly leads to the ability to acidify the environment in situ also remains to be tested.
   We screened 20 predominant subarctic bryophyte species, including fen brown mosses and bog Sphagna for CEC, in situ soil water acidification capacity (AC), and peat acid neutralizing capacity (ANC). All these bryophyte species possessed substantial CEC, which was remarkably similar for brown mosses and Sphagna. This refutes the commonly accepted idea of living Sphagnum CEC being responsible for peatland acidification, as Sphagnum's ecological predecessors, brown mosses, can do the same job. Sphagnum AC was several times higher than that of other bryophytes, suggesting that CE (cation exchange) sites of Sphagna in situ are not saturated with basic cations, probably due to the virtual absence of these cations in the bog water. Together, these results suggest that Sphagna can not realize their CEC in bogs, while fen mosses can do so in fens. The fen peat ANC was 65% higher than bog ANC, indicating that acidity released by brown mosses in the CE process was neutralized, maintaining an alkaline environment.
   We propose two successional pathways indicating boundaries for a fen-bog shift with respect to bryophyte CEC. In neither of them is Sphagnum CE an important factor. We conclude that living Sphagnum CEC does not play any considerable role in the fen-bog shift. Alternatively, we propose that exclusively indirect effects of Sphagnum expansion such as peat accumulation and subsequent blocking of upward alkaline soil water transport are keys to the fen-bog succession and therefore for bog-associated carbon accumulation.

AB Palsas and peat plateaus are permafrost landforms occurring in subarctic mires which constitute sensitive ecosystems with strong significance for vegetation, wildlife, hydrology and carbon cycle. Firstly, we have systematically mapped the occurrence of palsas and peat plateaus in the northernmost county of Norway (Finnmark, similar to 50 000 km(2)) by manual interpretation of aerial images from 2005 to 2014 at a spatial resolution of 250 m. At this resolution, mires and wetlands with palsas or peat plateaus occur in about 850 km(2) of Finnmark, with the actual palsas and peat plateaus underlain by permafrost covering a surface area of approximately 110 km(2). Secondly, we have quantified the lateral changes of the extent of palsas and peat plateaus for four study areas located along a NW-SE transect through Finnmark by utilizing repeat aerial imagery from the 1950s to the 2010s. The results of the lateral changes reveal a total decrease of 33-71% in the areal extent of palsas and peat plateaus during the study period, with the largest lateral change rates observed in the last decade. However, the results indicate that degradation of palsas and peat plateaus in northern Norway has been a consistent process during the second half of the 20th century and possibly even earlier. Significant rates of areal change are observed in all investigated time periods since the 1950s, and thermokarst landforms observed on aerial images from the 1950s suggest that lateral degradation was already an ongoing process at this time. The results of this study show that lateral erosion of palsas and peat plateaus is an important pathway for permafrost degradation in the sporadic permafrost zone in northern Scandinavia. While the environmental factors governing the rate of erosion are not yet fully understood, we note a moderate increase in air temperature, precipitation and snow depth during the last few decades in the region.

TI Paleoenvironmental response of midlatitudinal wetlands to

AB The early Paleogene is marked by multiple negative carbon isotope excursions (CIEs) that reflect massive short-term carbon cycle perturbations that coincide with significant warming during a high-p CO2 world, affecting both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Records of such hyperthermals from the marine-terrestrial interface (e.g., estuarine swamps and mire deposits) are therefore of great interest as their present-day counterparts are highly vulnerable to future climate and sea level change. Here, we assess paleoenvironmental changes of midlatitudinal late Paleocene-early Eocene peat mire records along the paleo-North Sea coast. We provide carbon isotope data of bulk organic matter (delta(TOC)-T-13C), organic carbon content (% TOC), and palynological data from an extensive peat mire deposited at a midlatitudinal (ca. 41 degrees N) coastal site (Schoningen, Germany). The delta(TOC)-T-13C data show a carbon isotope excursion of -1.3% (mean decrease in delta(TOC)-T-13C; -1.7% at the onset of CIE) coeval with a conspicuous Apectodinium acme. Due to the exceptionally large stratigraphic thickness of the CIE at Schoningen (10m of section) we established a detailed palynological record that indicates only minor changes in paleovegetation leading into and during this event. Instead, paleovegetation changes mostly follow natural successions in response to changes along the marine-terrestrial interface. The available age constraints for the Schoningen Formation hamper a solid assignment of the detected CIE to a particular hyperthermal such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) or any succeeding hyperthermal event such as the Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM2).
   Compared to other nearby peat mire records (Cobham, UK; Vasterival, F) it appears that wetland deposits around the Paleogene North Sea have a consistent CIE magnitude of ca. 1 : 3% in delta(TOC)-T-13C. Moreover, the Schoningen record shares major characteristics with the Cobham Lignite PETM record, including evidence for increased fire activity prior to the CIE, minor plant species change during the hyperthermal, a reduced CIE in delta(TOC)-T-13C, and drowning of the mire (marine ingressions) during much of the Schoningen CIE event. This suggests that either the Schoningen CIE reflects the PETM or that early Paleogene hyperthermals similarly affected paleoenvironmental conditions of a major segment of the paleo-North Sea coast.

AB We characterized peat decomposition at the Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF), Minnesota, USA, to a depth of 2m to ascertain the underlying chemical changes using Fourier transform infrared (FT IR) and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy) and related these changes to decomposition proxies C:N ratio, C-13 and N-15, bulk density, and water content. FT IR determined that peat humification increased rapidly between 30 and 75cm, indicating a highly reactive intermediate-depth zone consistent with changes in C:N ratio, C-13 and N-15, bulk density, and water content. Peat decomposition at the MEF, especially in the intermediate-depth zone, is mainly characterized by preferential utilization of O-alkyl-C, carboxyl-C, and other oxygenated functionalities with a concomitant increase in the abundance of alkyl- and nitrogen-containing compounds. Below 75cm, less change was observed but aromatic functionalities and lignin accumulated with depth. Significant correlations with humification indices, identified by FT IR spectroscopy, were found for C:N ratios. Incubation studies at 22 degrees C revealed the highest methane production rates, greatest CH4:CO2 production ratios, and significant O-alkyl-C utilization within this 30 and 75cm zone. Oxygen-containing functionalities, especially O-alkyl-C, appear to serve as excellent proxies for soil decomposition rate and should be a sensitive indicator of the response of the solid phase peat to increased temperatures caused by climate change and the field study manipulations that are planned to occur at this site. Radiocarbon signatures of microbial respiration products in deeper pore waters at the MEF resembled the signatures of more modern dissolved organic carbon rather than solid phase peat, indicating that recently photosynthesized organic matter fueled the bulk of subsurface microbial respiration. These results indicate that carbon cycling at depth at the MEF is not isolated from surface processes.

AB Here we examine the arrangement of plant species across an oligotrophic bog/poor fen peatland complex in the North American boreal plain and the relationships of these species to their physical and chemical environment. A semi-uniform spatial sampling approach was utilized to describe the species assemblages, pore-water chemistry and physical condition of 100 plots throughout a single peatland complex. Regardless of sharing the same ground cover of Sphagnum mosses, the remaining species separated into four distinct assemblages, each with unique indicators. These species groups along with associated chemical and physical factors are organized into four ecosites: bog, margin (edge) and two poor fen ecosites. The plant assemblages of this peatland have a complex relationship with numerous gradients, both physical and chemical, including depth to water table, shade, pH, nutrient and base cation. Rather than being homogenous across the landscape, most environmental variables exhibit distinct spatial patterns and do so in relationship to the plant assemblages, forming spatially distinct ecosites across the complex. Base cation concentrations play a smaller role than previously thought in differentiating these ecosites, and in addition to shade and depth to water table, nitrogen in the form of dissolved organic nitrogen was highly related to the placement of these ecosites. Many significant chemical factors appear related to evaporative water loss within the peatland complex, and these chemical factors are used to differentiate the ecosites. However, the mediation of evaporative water loss is due largely to self-generated responses of the plant assemblages related to shade through plant morphology and peat acrotelm development related to depth to water table. We conclude that plant species and associated environmental gradients act together to form spatially distinct ecosites. The distribution of these ecosites within this large, environmentally complex peatland is largely controlled by differing self-generated responses along the hydrotopographical gradient of differential water loss.

AB Changes to climate are projected over the next 50 years for many peatland areas. As decomposition of peat forming vegetation is likely to be intrinsically linked to these changes in climate, a clear understanding of climate-peat dynamics is required. There is concern that increased temperature and decreased precipitation could increase the rate of decomposition and put the carbon sink status of many peatlands at risk, yet few studies have examined the impact of both climatic factors together. To better understand the sensitivity of peatland decomposition to changes in both temperature and precipitation and their interaction, we conducted a short-term laboratory experiment in which plant litters and peat soil were incubated, in isolation, in a factorial design. Treatments simulated baseline and projected climate averages derived from the latest UK climate change projections (UKCP09) for Exmoor, a climatically marginal peatland in SW England. Regular carbon dioxide flux measurements were made throughout the simulation, as well as total mass loss and total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leached. The largest effect on carbon loss in this multifactor experiment was from substrate, with Sphagnum/peat releasing significantly less C in total during the experiment than dwarf shrubs/graminoids. Climate effects were substrate specific, with the drier rainfall treatment increasing the DOC leaching from Callum, but decreasing it from Sphagnum. Partitioning between CO2 and DOC was also affected by climate, but only for the peat and Sphagnum samples, where the future climate scenarios (warmer and drier) resulted in a greater proportion of C lost in gaseous form. These results suggest that indirect effects of climate through changes in species composition in peatlands could ultimately turn out to be more important for litter decomposition than direct effects of climate change from increased temperatures and decreased rainfall.

AB Drainage for forestry purposes increases the depth of the oxic peat layer and leads to increased growth of shrubs and trees. Concurrently, the production and uptake of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) change: due to the accelerated decomposition of peat in the presence of oxygen, drained peatlands are generally considered to lose peat carbon (C). We measured CO2 exchange with the eddy co-variance (EC) method above a drained nutrient-poor peatland forest in southern Finland for 16 months in 2004-2005. The site, classified as a dwarf-shrub pine bog, had been ditched about 35 years earlier. CH4 and N2O fluxes were measured at 2-5-week intervals with the chamber technique. Drainage had resulted in a relatively little change in the water table level, being on average 40 cm below the ground in 2005. The annual net ecosystem exchange was -870 +/- 100 gCO(2) m-(2) yr(-1) in the calendar year 2005, indicating net CO2 uptake from the atmosphere. The site was a small sink of CH4 (-0.12 gCH(4) m(-2) yr(-1)) and a small source of N2O (0.10 gN(2)Om(-2) yr(-1)). Photosynthesis was detected throughout the year when the air temperature exceeded -3 degrees C. As the annual accumulation of C in the above and below ground tree biomass (175 +/- 35 gCm(-2)) was significantly lower than the accumulation observed by the flux measurement (240 +/- 30 gCm(-2)), about 65 g Cm-2 yr(-1) was likely to have accumulated as organic matter into the peat soil. This is a higher average accumulation rate than previously reported for natural northern peatlands, and the first time C accumulation has been shown by EC measurements to occur in a forestry-drained peatland. Our results suggest that forestry-drainage may significantly increase the CO2 uptake rate of nutrient-poor peatland ecosystems.

AB Permafrost deposits constitute a large organic carbon pool highly vulnerable to degradation and potential carbon release due to global warming. Permafrost sections along coastal and river bank exposures in NE Siberia were studied for organic matter (OM) characteristics and ice content. OM stored in Quaternary permafrost grew, accumulated, froze, partly decomposed, and refroze under different periglacial environments, reflected in specific biogeochemical and cryolithological features. OM in permafrost is represented by twigs, leaves, peat, grass roots, and plant detritus. The vertical distribution of total organic carbon (TOC) in exposures varies from 0.1 wt % of the dry sediment in fluvial deposits to 45 wt % in Holocene peats. Variations in OM parameters are related to changes in vegetation, bioproductivity, pedogenic processes, decomposition, and sedimentation rates during past climate variations. High TOC, high C/N, and low delta C-13 reflect less decomposed OM accumulated under wet, anaerobic soil conditions characteristic of interglacial and interstadial periods. Glacial and stadial periods are characterized by less variable, low TOC, low C/N, and high delta C-13 values indicating stable environments with reduced bioproductivity and stronger OM decomposition under dryer, aerobic soil conditions. Based on TOC data and updated information on bulk densities, we estimate average organic carbon inventories for ten different stratigraphic units in northeast Siberia, ranging from 7.2 kg C m(-3) for Early Weichselian fluvial deposits, to 33.2 kg C m(-3) for Middle Weichselian Ice Complex deposits, to 74.7 kg C m(-3) for Holocene peaty deposits. The resulting landscape average is likely about 25% lower than previously published permafrost carbon inventories.

AB Boreal peatlands in Canada have harbored relict permafrost since the Little Ice Age due to the strong insulating properties of peat. Ongoing climate change has triggered widespread degradation of localized permafrost in peatlands across continental Canada. Here, we explore the influence of differing permafrost regimes (bogs with no surface permafrost, localized permafrost features with surface permafrost, and internal lawns representing areas of permafrost degradation) on rates of peat accumulation at the southernmost limit of permafrost in continental Canada. Net organic matter accumulation generally was greater in unfrozen bogs and internal lawns than in the permafrost landforms, suggesting that surface permafrost inhibits peat accumulation and that degradation of surface permafrost stimulates net carbon storage in peatlands. To determine whether differences in substrate quality across permafrost regimes control trace gas emissions to the atmosphere, we used a reciprocal transplant study to experimentally evaluate environmental versus substrate controls on carbon emissions from bog, internal lawn, and permafrost peat. Emissions of CO2 were highest from peat incubated in the localized permafrost feature, suggesting that slow organic matter accumulation rates are due, at least in part, to rapid decomposition in surface permafrost peat. Emissions of CH4 were greatest from peat incubated in the internal lawn, regardless of peat type. Localized permafrost features in peatlands represent relict surface permafrost in disequilibrium with the current climate of boreal North America, and therefore are extremely sensitive to ongoing and future climate change. Our results suggest that the loss of surface permafrost in peatlands increases net carbon storage as peat, though in terms of radiative forcing, increased CH4 emissions to the atmosphere will partially or even completely offset this enhanced peatland carbon sink for at least 70 years following permafrost degradation.

AB Land cover changes can impact the climate by influencing the surface energy and water balance. Naturally treeless or sparsely treed peatlands were extensively drained to stimulate forest growth in Finland over the second half of 20th century. The aim of this study is to investigate the biogeophysical effects of peatland forestation on regional climate in Finland. Two sets of 18-year climate simulations were done with the regional climate model REMO by using land cover data based on pre-drainage (1920s) and post-drainage (2000s) Finnish national forest inventories. In the most intensive peatland forestation area, located in the middle west of Finland, the results show a warming in April of up to 0.43K in monthly-averaged daily mean 2m air temperature, whereas a slight cooling from May to October of less than 0.1K in general is found. Consequently, snow clearance days over that area are advanced up to 5 days in the mean of 15 years. No clear signal is found for precipitation. Through analysing the simulated temperature and energy balance terms, as well as snow depth over five selected subregions, a positive feedback induced by peatland forestation is found between decreased surface albedo and increased surface air temperature in the snow-melting period. Our modelled results show good qualitative agreements with the observational data. In general, decreased surface albedo in the snow-melting period and increased evapotranspiration in the growing period are the most important biogeophysical aspects induced by peatland forestation that cause changes in climate. The results from this study can be further integrally analysed with biogeochemical effects of peatland forestation to provide background information for adapting future forest management to mitigate climate warming effects. Moreover, they provide insights about the impacts of projected forestation of tundra at high latitudes due to climate change.

AB This paper presents pollen analyses and radiocarbon dating on Crocuta coprolites from Las Ventanas (LV) and Carihuela (Car) Caves in southern Spain (Granada), with the aim of reconstructing the environmental conditions of these hominin sites. The LV coprolites are radiocarbon dated from c. 37,890 to 6980 cal yr BP, and the Car coprolites from c. 31,063 to 7861 cal yr BP. Overall, the palaeoecological scenario inferred from both coprolite series display similar patterns, with Pinus, Poaceae, and Artemisia as dominant during the full Pleistocene, and an important contribution of Quercus in the most recently dated coprolite samples. While the palynology is consistent with results of former investigations on the past environments in the region as obtained from other deposits (peat bogs, cave infills), the Late Glacial and Holocene chronology of several coprolites in both sites is in conflict with the generally accepted timing of extinction of Crocuta in western Europe. A discussion on the taphonomical processes and potential sources of carbon contamination of the radiocarbon samples is provided. The correlation between pollen from coprolites and from sedimentary records, and the paucity of the fossil bone record suggests nevertheless, that a late survival of Crocuta in southern Spain should not be categorically discarded.

AB Northern Canadian peatlands represent a long term sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), however there is concern they may become a net source of CO2 due to climatic change. Climatic change is expected to result in significant changes in regional hydrology in boreal and subarctic regions of Canada. A hydrologic model predicted a summer water table drop of 0.14 m in northern Canadian fens given an increase in summer temperature and rainfall of 3 degrees C and 1 mm d(-1), respectively. Moreover, surface peat temperature increased by 2.3 degrees C. Net ecosystem exchange of CO2 was modelled using these modelled hydrologic and thermal changes with respiration:peat temperature and water table:net ecosystem production relationships developed from measurements at wetlands in northern Sweden and near Churchill, Manitoba. Model results indicate that the net atmospheric CO2 sink function of fens may be enhanced under future 2 x CO2, scenarios, while bogs may become a net source of atmospheric CO2. If the net ecosystem productivity response to the new hydrologic conditions was ignored then the model predicts a decrease in summer carbon storage for all peatland types.

AB Peatlands are a type of wetland characterized by the accumulation of organic matter, called peat, and are important carbon reservoirs. In areas with poor drainage, human-induced forest fires and logging can produce flooded conditions and organic matter accumulation, which generates an ecosystem called anthropogenic peatland. Productive management activities such as Sphagnum moss harvesting and livestock grazing take place there. Our hypothesis was that productive management has a strong impact on the aboveground C reservoir and increases the presence of exotic species. We established 44 sampling points in a 16-ha anthropogenic peatland on Chiloe Island, Chile, comparing productive and conservation types of managements. Carbon stocks, vegetation structure and composition variables were quantified. These variables were used to classify the ecosystem into microsites to analyze the different locations in the peatland. In addition, predictive models of aboveground carbon were created using Landsat 8 OLI and Pleiades images. The results revealed a carbon stock of 11.99 +/- 0.77 kg C m(-2), which is smaller than in natural peatlands, and showed a wide variability of conditions within the peatland itself. This variability, mainly expressed in aboveground carbon, produces microsites dominated by either shrubs, species of the genus Juncus or grasses. Productive management reduced accumulated carbon in the aboveground stock and in the woody debris. However, the strongest impact was found on the vegetation variables, with a decrease in total cover, cover of shrubs and herbaceous plants, and in vegetation height. There was also an increase in the richness and presence of exotic species. The spatial prediction of aboveground carbon yielded significant results using only spectral indices, showing also that the impact of productive management is not homogenous, being less intense in waterlogged areas. This study is the first to quantify carbon reservoirs in this type of ecosystem and to propose variables that can be used as indicators of the impact of human activities.

AB Climate change affects peatlands directly through increased air temperatures and indirectly through changes in water-table level (WL). The interactions of these two still remain poorly known. We determined experimentally the separate and interactive effects of temperature and WL regime on factors of relevance for the inputs to the carbon cycle: plant community composition, phenology, biomass production, and shoot:root allocation in two wet boreal sedge-dominated fens, southern at 62 degrees N and northern at 68 degrees N. Warming (1.5 degrees C higher average daily air temperature) was induced with open-top chambers and WL drawdown (WLD; 3-7cm on average) by shallow ditches. Total biomass production varied from 250 to 520 g/m(2), with belowground production comprising 25%-63%. Warming was associated with minor effects on phenology and negligible effects on community composition, biomass production, and allocation. WLD clearly affected the contribution of different plant functional types (PFTs) in the community and the biomass they produced: shrubs benefited while forbs and mosses suffered. These responses did not depend on the warming treatment. Following WLD, aboveground biomass production decreased mainly due to reduced growth of mosses in the southern fen. Aboveground vascular plant biomass production remained unchanged but the contribution of different PFTs changed. The observed changes were also reflected in plant phenology, with different PFTs showing different responses. Belowground production increased following WLD in the northern fen only, but an increase in the contributions of shrubs and forbs was observed in both sites, while sedge contribution decreased. Moderate warming alone seems not able to drive significant changes in plant productivity or community composition in these wet ecosystems. However, if warming is accompanied by even modest WL drawdown, changes should be expected in the relative contribution of PFTs, which could lead to profound changes in the function of fens. Consequently, hydrological scenarios are of utmost importance when estimating their future function.

AB Aims Canopy height is a key driver of forest biodiversity and carbon cycling. Accurate estimates of canopy height are needed for assessing mechanisms relating to ecological patterns and processes of tree height limitations. At global scales forest canopy height patterns are largely controlled by climate, while local variation at fine scales is due to differences in disturbance history and local patterns in environmental conditions. The relative effect of local environmental drivers on canopy height is poorly understood partly due to gaps in data on canopy height and methods for examining limiting factors. Here, we used airborne laser scanning (ALS) data on vegetation structure of boreal forests to examine the effects of environmental factors on potential maximum forest canopy height.
   Methods Relationships between maximum canopy height from ALS measures and environmental variables were examined to assess factors limiting tree height. Specifically, we used quantile regression at the 0.90 quantile to relate maximum canopy height with environmental characteristics of climate (i.e. mean annual temperature [MAT] and mean annual precipitation), terrain (i.e. slope) and depth-to-water (DTW) across a 33000 km(2) multiple use boreal forest landscape in northeast Alberta, Canada.
   Important Findings Maximum canopy height was positively associated with MAT, terrain slope and terrain-derived DTW, collectively explaining 33.2% of the variation in heights. The strongest explanatory variable was DTW explaining 26% of canopy height variation with peatland forests having naturally shorter maximum canopy heights, but also more sites currently at their maximum potential height. In contrast, the most productive forests (i.e. mesic to xeric upland forests) had the fewest sites at their potential maximum height, illustrating the effects of long-term forest management, wildfires and general anthropogenic footprints on reducing the extent and abundance of older, taller forest habitat in Alberta's boreal forest.

AB Peatlands are being degraded by the combined impacts of land use and climate change. Carbon stored in peat is a key constituent of aquatic food webs in rivers and lakes of humic catchments, and changes in the downstream transport of this allochthonous carbon may have considerable implications for the production of Atlantic salmon and brown trout. Understanding the food web of these keystone species is therefore crucial to their conservation in a changing world. Here, we use a combination of stomach content analysis (SCA) and stable isotope analysis (SIA) to characterise the diet of juvenile salmonids in aquatic habitats of a typical Irish peatland catchment (Burrishoole). SCA showed that Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera were the main components of the diet of juvenile salmonids. Daphnia were the primary prey item in salmon smolt stomachs. The average stable isotope signature of salmonids was 9.26 +/- 0.87 parts per thousand delta N-15 and -25.6 +/- 1.99 parts per thousand delta C-13, but differed between species, age class and habitat (river vs lake). Salmonids were supported by a wide range of carbon energy sources, with delta C-13 increasing as fish moved downstream out of the headwater rivers and into a large downstream lake.

AB Peatland ecosystems are globally important carbon and terrestrial surface water stores that have formed over millennia. These ecosystems have likely optimized their ecohydrological function over the long-term development of their soil hydraulic properties. The optimization of peat hydraulic properties is examined to determine which of the following conditions peatland ecosystems target during this development: (i) maximize carbon accumulation, (ii) maximize water storage, or (iii) balance carbon profit across hydrological disturbances. To identify this control, the short-term hydrological response of a 0.5-m-deep peat profile was simulated during a 50-day rain-free period. A total of 5000 Monte-Carlo model realizations were conducted, with peat hydraulic properties differing between each realization (values derived from known probability distributions). Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) and empirical van Genuchten water retention parameter alpha were shown to provide a first order control on simulated water tensions. For hypothetical combinations of K-s and alpha, the probability that water tension exceeds the ecologically important threshold of 100 mb within 24 h showed a bimodal distribution. A peak at high probabilities was associated with profiles of high K-s and low alpha. Such a profile is optimized for water storage. A peak at low probabilities is associated with low K-s, high alpha, and is optimized for carbon accumulation. Actual hydraulic properties from five northern peatlands fall between this binominal distribution, balancing the competing demands of carbon accumulation and water storage. We argue that peat hydraulic properties are thus optimized to maximize water use efficiency and that this optimization occurs over a centennial to millennial timescale.

AB Historically, slow decomposition rates have resulted in the accumulation of large amounts of carbon in northern peatlands. Both climate warming and vegetation change can alter rates of decomposition, and hence affect rates of atmospheric CO2 exchange, with consequences for climate change feedbacks. Although warming and vegetation change are happening concurrently, little is known about their relative and interactive effects on decomposition processes. To test the effects of warming and vegetation change on decomposition rates, we placed litter of three dominant species (Calluna vulgaris, Eriophorum vaginatum, Hypnum jutlandicum) into a peatland field experiment that combined warming with plant functional group removals, and measured mass loss over two years. To identify potential mechanisms behind effects, we also measured nutrient cycling and soil biota. We found that plant functional group removals exerted a stronger control over short-term litter decomposition than did similar to 1 degrees C warming, and that the plant removal effect depended on litter species identity. Specifically, rates of litter decomposition were faster when shrubs were removed from the plant community, and these effects were strongest for graminoid and bryophyte litter. Plant functional group removals also had strong effects on soil biota and nutrient cycling associated with decomposition, whereby shrub removal had cascading effects on soil fungal community composition, increased enchytraeid abundance, and increased rates of N mineralization. Our findings demonstrate that, in addition to litter quality, changes in vegetation composition play a significant role in regulating short-teem litter decomposition and belowground communities in peatland, and that these impacts can be greater than moderate warming effects. Our findings, albeit from a relatively short-term study, highlight the need to consider both vegetation change and its impacts below ground alongside climatic effects when predicting future decomposition rates and carbon storage in peatlands.

AB Boreal wetland carbon cycling is vulnerable to climate change in part because hydrology and the extent of frozen ground have strong influences on plant and microbial functions. We examined the response of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) across an experimental manipulation of water table position (both raised and lowered water table treatments) in a boreal-rich fen in interior Alaska. DOC and TDN responses to water table manipulation exhibited an interaction with seasonal ice dynamics. We observed consistently higher DOC and TDN concentrations in the lowered water table treatment (71.7 +/- 6.5 and 3.0 +/- 0.3 mg(-L)) than in both the control (55.6 +/- 5.1 and 2.3 +/- 0.2 mg(-L)) and raised (49.1 +/- 4.3 and 1.9 +/- 0.1 mg L-1, respectively) water table treatments. Across all plots, pore water DOC concentrations at 20 cm increased as the depth to water table increased (R-2 = 0.43, p < 0.001). DOC concentrations also increased as the seasonal thaw depth increased, with solutes increasing most rapidly in the drained plot (R-2 = 0.62, p < 0.001). About half of the TDN pool was composed of dissolved organic N (DON). Inorganic N and DON were both highly correlated with changes in DOC, and their respective constraints to mineralization are discussed. These results demonstrate that a declining water table position and dryer conditions affect thaw depth and peat temperatures, and interactions among these ecosystem properties will likely increase DOC and TDN loading and potential for export in these systems.

AB Peat is a crucial carbon sink in the terrestrial ecosystem, but it is jeopardized by its use as fuel or as growing media. In the last years, much research has been performed aiming to find high quality and low cost substrates from different organic wastes in order to decrease peat consumption. Biochar is a carbon-rich material that has attracted important research as soil amendment. However, its potential utilization as peat substitute for growing media formulation remains less well explored. The main objective of this work was to study the effect on peat based growing media of pruning waste (PW) and three biochars: a commercial charcoal (CC), biochar from slow pyrolysis of PW at 300 degrees C (B300) and 500 degrees C (B500) added at different ratios. The chemical properties of some mixtures were adequate as growing media materials. Hydrophysical properties of peat changed with biochar and pruning waste additions. B500 and CC additions (in 50 and 75 vol%) increased air space volume. All mixtures showed lower water holding capacities than peat and only mixtures with B500 lead to adequate holding capacity and porosity values for substrate materials. Finally, lettuce (Lactuca saliva) was grown in the different substrates and, after 5 weeks, the results have shown that lettuce biomass was substantially higher with peat plus biochar samples obtained from pyrolysis of pruning waste at 300 and especially 500 degrees C than with peat alone. Our results imply that pruning residue biochar can be an improved growing media as peat substitute for soilless vegetable production. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The use of fire in land management has come under increasing scrutiny with regard to its potential effects on sustainability and climate change. Moorlands in the United Kingdom have traditionally used rotational burning of the heather (Calluna vulgaris) to improve the grazing and habitat, especially for grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus). However, these ecosystems overlie carbon-rich soils and concerns have been raised about the merits of this practice. In order to assess the impact of rotational burning on carbon balance, an investigation was undertaken on a grouse moor in the Yorkshire Dales, UK. This showed that the quantity of carbon stored above ground in heather biomass ranged from 600 to 1325 g C/m(2) (typical for UK upland heaths). However, the national UK carbon inventory assumes 200 g C/m(2), thereby appearing to underestimate considerably the importance of these habitats for carbon storage above ground.
   Analysis of 2 burns in subsequent years showed that 16 +/- 4% and 24 +/- 5% (+/- s.e.) of the above-ground material was consumed in the fires, resulting in the direct release of 103 +/- 22 and 201 +/- 62 g/m(2) of carbon, respectively. Indirect carbon losses, which other studies have shown to be primarily due to erosion, were estimated to release another 5-21 g C/m(2). year. The significance of other major greenhouse gas fluxes was assessed for the whole system using published parameters and models. We show that, over the burning cycle of 15-20 years, losses of carbon from burning are < 10% of the total losses of carbon from the system, implying that careful burning management at this site does not have a major detrimental effect on the carbon budget, which for this moor lies within the range of an annual net loss of 34 g C/m(2). year to a net uptake of 146 g C/m(2) year.

AB Predictive understanding of northern peatland hydrology is a necessary precursor to understanding the fate of massive carbon stores in these systems under the influence of present and future climate change. Current models have begun to address microtopographic controls on peatland hydrology, but none have included a prognostic calculation of peatland water table depth for a vegetated wetland, independent of prescribed regional water tables. We introduce here a new configuration of the Community Land Model (CLM) which includes a fully prognostic water table calculation for a vegetated peatland. Our structural and process changes to CLM focus on modifications needed to represent the hydrologic cycle of bogs environment with perched water tables, as well as distinct hydrologic dynamics and vegetation communities of the raised hummock and sunken hollow microtopography characteristic of peatland bogs. The modified model was parameterized and independently evaluated against observations from an ombrotrophic raised-dome bog in northern Minnesota (S1-Bog), the site for the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climatic and Environmental Change experiment (SPRUCE). Simulated water table levels compared well with site-level observations. The new model predicts hydrologic changes in response to planned warming at the SPRUCE site. At present, standing water is commonly observed in bog hollows after large rainfall events during the growing season, but simulations suggest a sharp decrease in water table levels due to increased evapotranspiration under the most extreme warming level, nearly eliminating the occurrence of standing water in the growing season. Simulated soil energy balance was strongly influenced by reduced winter snowpack under warming simulations, with the warming influence on soil temperature partly offset by the loss of insulating snowpack in early and late winter. The new model provides improved predictive capacity for seasonal hydrological dynamics in northern peatlands, and provides a useful foundation for investigation of northern peatland carbon exchange.

AB Peatlands cover approximately 65,600 km(2) (16 %) of the Swedish land area. The available areas suitable for peatland expansion are far from occupied after ca. 12,000 years of the present interglacial. We estimate the potential extent of peatland in Sweden, based on slope properties of possible areas excluding lakes and glaciofluvial deposits. We assume no human presence or anthropic effects, so the calculation is speculative. It may have been relevant for previous interglacials.
   We calculate the potential final area of peatlands in three scenarios where they cover all available land with different maximum slope angles (1-3 degrees) using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The three scenarios yield potential peatland areas of 95,663 km(2) (21 % of total available area), 168,287 km2 (38 %) and 222,141 km(2) (50 %). The relative increases from the present 65,600 km(2) are 46, 157 and 239 % respectively.
   The slope scenarios give CO2 uptake rates of 8.9-10.8, 18.1-22.4 and 24.6-30.5 Mt yr(-1). Under global warming conditions with isotherms moved northwards and to higher altitudes, following an increase of raised bog area, the CO2 uptake rates might increase to 12.2-13.8, 24.4-27.7 and 33.5-37.9 Mt yr(-1); i.e. up to 4.3-4.9 vpb of atmospheric CO2. If we make the speculative extrapolation from Sweden to all high latitude peatlands, and assume that all suitable areas with slope angle <= 3 degrees become occupied, the global peatland CO2 sink might approach 3.7 Gt yr(-1) (about 2 vpm yr(-1)) and potentially cause a net radiative cooling approaching 5 W m(-2).

AB Peatlands, in their pristine state, are important long-term sinks of carbon. The extraction of peat for horticultural purposes or for biofuel however, may lead to a shift in the carbon dynamics. Additionally, the change in environmental conditions after extraction could allow for invasive species to establish and spread across the peatland. While the benefits and advantages of various restoration management practices have been identified, there has been less attention paid to the carbon exchange from unrestored peatlands at the ecosystem level. This study analyzed the carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from a post-extraction, unrestored peatland in Eastern Quebec at both the plant community level, using chamber methods, and at the ecosystem level, using eddy covariance techniques for two successive years. Methane flux at the plant community level was also measured. The site is an overall source of CO2, releasing a cumulative annual total of 173 and 259 g C m(-2) for 2014 and 2015, respectively and a small source of methane, releasing an average annual cumulative total of 1 g C m(-2). Results from this study will help managers assess the importance of post-extraction peatland restoration, by comparing the differences in CO2 exchange between restored and unrestored peatlands.

AB As the largest biogeochemically active terrestrial reserve of carbon (C), soils have the potential to either mitigate or amplify rates of climate change. Ecosystems with large C stocks and high rates of soil C sequestration, in particular, may have outsized impacts on regional and global C cycles. Montane meadows have large soil C stocks relative to surrounding ecosystems. However, anthropogenic disturbances in many meadows may have altered the balance of C inputs and outputs, potentially converting these soils from net C sinks to net sources of C to the atmosphere. Here, we quantified ecosystem-level C inputs and outputs to estimate the annual net soil C flux from 13 montane meadows spanning a range of conditions throughout the California Sierra Nevada. Our results suggest that meadow soils can be either large net C sinks (577.6 +/- 250.5 g C m(-2) y(-1)) or sources of C to the atmosphere (- 391.6 +/- 154.2 g C m(-2) y(-1)). Variation in the direction and magnitude of net soil C flux appears to be driven by belowground C inputs. Vegetation species and functional group composition were not associated with the direction of net C flux, but climate and watershed characteristics were. Our results demonstrate that, per unit area, montane meadows hold a greater potential for C sequestration than the surrounding forest. However, legacies of disturbance have converted some meadows to strong net C sources. Accurate quantification of ecosystem-level C fluxes is critical for the development of regional C budgets and achieving global emissions goals.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) stored in northern peatlands and permafrost-affected soils are key components in the global carbon cycle. This article quantifies SOC stocks in a sub-Arctic mountainous peatland environment in the discontinuous permafrost zone in Abisko, northern Sweden. Four machine-learning techniques are evaluated for SOC quantification: multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, support vector machine and random forest. The random forest model performed best and was used to predict SOC for several depth increments at a spatial resolution of 1 m (1 x 1 m). A high-resolution (1 m) land cover classification generated for this study is the most relevant predictive variable. The landscape mean SOC storage (0-150 cm) is estimated to be 8.3 +/- 8.0 kg C m(-2) and the SOC stored in the top meter (0-100 cm) to be 7.7 +/- 6.2 kg C m(-2). The predictive modeling highlights the relative importance of wetland areas and in particular peat plateaus for the landscape's SOC storage. The total SOC was also predicted at reduced spatial resolutions of 2, 10, 30, 100, 250 and 1000 m and shows a significant drop in land cover class detail and a tendency to underestimate the SOC at resolutions > 30 m. This is associated with the occurrence of many small-scale wetlands forming local hot-spots of SOC storage that are omitted at coarse resolutions. Sharp transitions in SOC storage associated with land cover and permafrost distribution are the most challenging methodological aspect. However, in this study, at local, regional and circum-Arctic scales, the main factor limiting robust SOC mapping efforts is the scarcity of soil pedon data from across the entire environmental space. For the Abisko region, past SOC and permafrost dynamics indicate that most of the SOC is barely 2000 years old and very dynamic. Future research needs to investigate the geomorphic response of permafrost degradation and the fate of SOC across all landscape compartments in post-permafrost landscapes.

AB Large numbers of peatlands were developed in volcanic landform regions, which would provide valuable long-term records of lake-mire ecosystem shifts and act as significant carbon pool in regional carbon cycle. To investigate lake-mire ecosystem transformations and driving mechanisms in volcanic landform regions, the developmental history of Gushantun peatland in northeast China was reconstructed in this study. Results indicate that Gushantun peatland initiated in the deepest portions of the basin, and subsequently experienced expansions outward. Peat initiated from approximately 12kacal. BP to present. The developmental patterns of Gushantun peatland can be divided into four stages: the stable stage 1 (12-10kacal. BP), maximum stage (10-7kacal. BP), stable stage 2 (7-4kacal. BP) and stable stage 3 (4-0kacal. BP). The possible forcing mechanisms for the development of Gushantun peatland were different during different periods. From 12kacal. BP to 10kacal. BP, autogenic process was probably the major controlling factor for the expansion of this peatland. From 10 to 7kacal. BP, flat basin morphology was the major influence factor for fast expansion. However, the development of Gushantun peatland was probably controlled by the dual effects of high moisture and autogenic process during the period of 7 to 4kacal. BP. From 4kacal. BP to present, steep basin morphology was the major influence factor, while moisture might be the secondary factor for development of Gushantun peatland. These features indicate that lake-mire ecosystem transforms in volcanic landform regions of Changbai Mountains were probably triggered by the complex effects of autogenic process, hydroclimate and underlying basin morphology.

AB [1] Mires are key landscape elements at high latitudes and have certainly accumulated carbon during the Holocene, but their current carbon balance at the present time is very unclear. The major carbon flux is the land-atmosphere CO2 exchange and full-year data are still limited. Here we present data from 3 a (2001-2003) of continuous Eddy Covariance measurements at Degero Stormyr (64 degrees 11'N, 19 degrees 33'E) an oligotrophic, minerotrophic mire in Sweden. The climate at the site is defined as cold temperate humid, with 30-a annual precipitation and temperature means of 523 mm and +1.2 degrees C, respectively, while the mean temperatures in July and January are +14.7 degrees C and -12.4 degrees C, respectively. The length of the vegetation period was 153 +/- 15 d during the measured years. The minerotrophic mire represented a net sink for the vertical exchange of atmospheric CO2-C during the 3 a, with an average net uptake of 55 +/- 7 g ( mean +/- SD) CO2-C m(-2) a(-1). The growing season average uptake was 92 +/- 10 g CO2-C m(-2), of which approximately 40% ( 37 +/- 5 g CO2-C m(-2)) was lost during the nongrowing season. The daily average uptake over the growing season was 0.65 +/- 0.57, 0.73 +/- 0.61, and 0.68 +/- 0.62 g CO2-C m(-2) d(-1) in 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively. The daily average net uptake for the month with highest uptake was 1.10 +/- 0.33, 1.11 +/- 0.63, and 1.22 +/- 0.55 g CO2-C m(-2) d(-1) in July 2001, July 2002, and June 2003, respectively. The daily average efflux during the nongrowing season was 0.14 +/- 0.28, 0.15 +/- 0.20, and 0.20 +/- 0.19 g CO2-C m(-2) d(-1) in the years 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively.

AB 1. Changing temperature regimes and precipitation patterns in the Subarctic will impact on vegetation composition and diversity including those of bryophyte and lichen communities, which are major drivers of high-latitude carbon and nutrient cycling and hydrology.
   2. We investigated the relative importance of such impacts at different temporal, spatial and plant functional scales in subarctic Sphagnum fuscum-dominated peatlands, comprising both an in situ warming experiment and natural climatic and topographic gradients in northern Sweden and Norway. We applied multivariate analyses to investigate the relationships among cryptogam and vascular plant species composition and abiotic (temperature, moisture) and biotic (Sphagnum growth) regimes at various scales.
   3. At the short-term temporal scale (4-year warming experiment), increased temperature yielded no clear effect on cryptogam or vascular plant species composition. Spatially, direct effects of temperature were decisive for overall species composition across regions (macro-scale) rather than within one region (meso-scale). Moisture and Sphagnum growth were drivers of species composition at all spatial scales, and Sphagnum growth itself depended on its position on the microtopographic gradient and on temperature.
   4. Grouping of bryophytes and lichens at increasing scales of functional aggregation from species, growth form to the major higher taxon level (Sphagnum, other mosses, liverworts, lichens) revealed mostly increasing correlation with climate regimes and Sphagnum growth. Excluding liverworts from the analysis tended to reduce the correlation.
   5. Abundances of lichens, liverworts, non-Sphagnum mosses and (to a lesser degree) vascular plants were negatively related to Sphagnum abundance. Few cryptogam and vascular plant species showed a positive relationship with Sphagnum abundance. Correspondingly, cryptogam species richness and Shannon Index on peatlands strongly declined as Sphagnum abundance increased, while indices for vascular plants showed no significant relationship.
   6. Synthesis. Scale, be it spatial or functional, strongly determined which environmental drivers showed the clearest relationships with vegetation composition and diversity. Our findings will help to optimize predictions about long-term effects of climate on peatland vegetation composition, and subsequently its feedbacks to carbon and water cycles, at the regional scale.

AB Northern wetlands make up a substantial terrestrial carbon sink and are often dominated by decay-resistant Sphagnum mosses. Recent studies have shown that planctomycetes appear to be involved in degradation of Sphagnum-derived debris. Novel trimethylornithine (TMO) lipids have recently been characterized as abundant lipids in various Sphagnum wetland planctomycete isolates, but their occurrence in the environment has not yet been confirmed. We applied a combined intact polar lipid (IPL) and molecular analysis of peat cores collected from two northern wetlands (Sax Mosse [Sweden] and Obukhovskoye [Russia]) in order to investigate the preferred niche and abundance of TMO-producing planctomycetes. TMOs were present throughout the profiles of Sphagnum bogs, but their concentration peaked at the oxic/anoxic interface, which coincided with a maximum abundance of planctomycete-specific 16S rRNA gene sequences. The sequences detected at the oxic/anoxic interface were affiliated with the Isosphaera group, while sequences present in the anoxic peat layers were related to an uncultured planctomycete group. Pyrosequencing-based analysis identified Planctomycetes as the major bacterial group at the oxic/anoxic interface at the Obukhovskoye peat (54% of total 16S rRNA gene sequence reads), followed by Acidobacteria (19% reads), while in the Sax Mosse peat, Acidobacteria were dominant (46%), and Planctomycetes contributed to 6% of the total reads. The detection of abundant TMO lipids in planctomycetes isolated from peat bogs and the lack of TMO production by cultures of acidobacteria suggest that planctomycetes are the producers of TMOs in peat bogs. The higher accumulation of TMOs at the oxic/anoxic interface and the change in the planctomycete community with depth suggest that these IPLs could be synthesized as a response to changing redox conditions at the oxic/anoxic interface.

AB Vegetation, temperature and hydrology are major factors controlling wetland methane (CH4) dynamics. In order to test their importance, we measured CH4 emissions and environmental characteristics over 2 years from five mires representing a successional sequence, ranging in age from 178 to 2,520 years. We hypothesized CH4 emissions to be higher from the sedge-dominated fens than from the older bog stage. The more constant hydrological conditions at later successional stages as a consequence of the thicker peat layer appeared to result in lower temporal variation in CH4 emissions. Accordingly, the other controls, temperature and vegetation, had an effect on CH4 emissions only when the water table was sufficiently high. The seasonal variation in CH4 emissions was controlled by temperature only at the oldest study site, which had the lowest variation in water table. Within-season variation in emissions related to plant phenology was highest at the fen stage, which was dominated by aerenchymatous plants with a strong seasonal pattern, namely sedges and forbs. In contrast to our hypothesis, CH4 emissions increased with mire age towards the bog stage. However, the trend did not emerge during a rainy growing season, due to a rise in CH4 emissions at the younger stages. The results may imply two different mechanisms during mire succession: while old mires are able to avoid the perturbation associated with variation in the water table and maintain their function as CH4 emitters, young mires are exposed to perturbation but are able to recover their function.

AB Changes in the structure of plant communities may have much more impact on ecosystem carbon (C) cycling than any phenotypic responses to environmental changes. We studied these impacts via the response of plant litter quality, at the level of species and community, to persistent water-level (WL) drawdown in peatlands. We studied three sites with different nutrient regimes, and water-level manipulations at two time scales. The parameters used to characterize litter quality included extractable substances, cellulose, holocellulose, composition of hemicellulose (neutral sugars, uronic acids), Klason lignin, CuO oxidation phenolic products, and concentrations of C and several nutrients. The litters formed four chemically distinct groups: non-graminoid foliar litters, graminoids, mosses and woody litters. Direct effects of WL drawdown on litter quality at the species level were overruled by indirect effects via changes in litter type composition. The pristine conditions were characterized by Sphagnum moss and graminoid litters. Short-term (years) responses of the litter inputs to WL drawdown were small. In long-term (decades), total litter inputs increased, due to increased tree litter inputs. Simultaneously, the litter type composition and its chemical quality at the community level greatly changed. The changes that we documented will strongly affect soil properties and C cycle of peatlands.

AB There is a growing need to describe and quantify the heterogeneity in soil carbon pools in forests. In landscapes where topography is an important control on geomorphological, hydrological and/or biogeochemical processes, topographic features can be useful for partitioning the landscape into homogeneous units of soil carbon. Of particular interest are topographic features that are rare or cover a small proportion of the landscape but are disproportionately important in terms of soil carbon pools and/or fluxes. We developed an automated method for classifying topographic features by combining expert knowledge and a probabilistic approach. The topographic features were then used as a template from which to collect samples to estimate carbon of canopy leaves, freshly fallen litter, the forest floor, and the organic-rich A horizon or peat to a 5 cm depth within a small catchment of the Turkey Lakes Watershed of central Ontario. While the carbon in canopy foliage was homogeneous, there was significant heterogeneity in soil carbon pools among the topographic features, reflecting the importance of physical processes in shaping the distribution of soil carbon pools within this forested landscape. The catchment-aggregated estimates were under-estimated by 17% when only the dominant topographic feature was considered (i.e., 242 Mg C if backslope only used compared to 291 Mg C if all topographic features used). A Monte Carlo simulation method used to bound the uncertainty in soil carbon pools within each topographic feature resulted in catchment-aggregated estimates of 288 +/- 56.0 (maximum probability) and 290 +/- 51.3 Mg C (weighted probability) in the combined freshly fallen litter, forest floor, and the organic-rich A horizon or peat pool. The creation and application of this topographic template was useful for detecting, strategically sampling, and then mapping and scaling heterogeneity in soil carbon pools on the landscape.

AB Background and aims In forestry-drained peatlands, drying leads to changes in C cycling which could affect peat delta C-13. Furthermore, the delta C-13 profile of the entire peat column may reveal effects of earlier climatic periods. Methods We measured peat delta C-13 and C inventories in adjacent peat profiles, two collected from undrained and two from the drained side of a bog that was partially ditch-drained 37 years earlier. The cores were sliced into 10-cm subsamples for analyses; matching of the profiles based on surface levelling, peat stratigraphic correlation and a horizontal ash layer found in both profiles. Results Surface subsidence of 30 cm was observed in the dried site and the uppermost 160 cm in the undrained site contained an excess of 5.9 kg m(-2) of C compared with the corresponding strata of the ditch-drained site. The delta C-13 values increased but markedly only in the thin surface layer of the drained site, indicating low delta C-13 of the missing C (ca. -30 parts per thousand). In the deeper strata, dating to Mid-Holocene, high dry bulk density, C%, N%, humification index and low C/N ratio were connected to low delta C-13 of peat. Conclusions Drainage of 37 years increased delta C-13 values in the upper peat profile of the drained bog and led to the selective loss of C-13 depleted C. Results indicate that C balance studies can be aided by C isotope analyses. Low delta C-13 values in the peat profile indicate the existence of a wet fen stage during the moist and warm period during Mid-Holocene.

AB Inland waters transport and emit into the atmosphere large amounts of carbon (C), which originates from terrestrial ecosystems. The effect of land cover and land-use practises on C export from terrestrial ecosystems to inland waters is not fully understood, especially in heterogeneous landscapes under human influence. We sampled for dissolved C species in five tributaries with well-determined subcatchments (total size 174.5km(2)), as well as in various points of two of the subcatchments draining to a boreal lake in southern Finland over a full year. Our aim was to find out how land cover and land-use affect C export from the catchments, as well as CH4 and CO2 concentrations of the streams, and if the origin of C in stream water can be determined from proxies for quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM). We further estimated the gas evasion from stream surfaces and the role of aquatic fluxes in regional C cycling. The export rate of C from the terrestrial system through an aquatic conduit was 19.3g Cm-2(catchment)yr(-1), which corresponds to 19% of the estimated terrestrial net ecosystem exchange of the catchment. Most of the C load to the recipient lake consisted of dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 6.1 +/- 1.0g Cm(-2)yr(-1)); the share of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was much smaller (1.0 +/- 0.2g Cm(-2)yr(-1)). CO2 and CH4 emissions from stream and ditch surfaces were 7.0 +/- 2.4g Cm(-2)yr(-1) and 0.1 +/- 0.04g Cm(-2)yr(-1), respectively, C emissions being thus equal with C load to the lake. The proportion of peatland in the catchment and the drainage density of peatland increased DOC in streams, whereas the proportion of agricultural land in the catchment decreased it. The opposite was true for DIC. Drained peatlands were an important CH4 source for streams.

AB Wetlands are exceptional ecosystems that contribute to biodiversity and play a key role in the hydrological and carbon cycles. Knowledge of their long-term ecology is essential for a proper understanding of these valuable ecosystems. We present the application of multi-proxy analyses to a 115 cm-thick core from La Molina mire (Alto de la Espina) located in NW Iberia, with a chronology spanning since similar to 500 BC. The mire is located in an area intensively mined for gold during the Roman period, and close to a water-canalization system used for mining operations at that time. Our aim was to get insights into the development of the wetland by combining palynological records of hydro-hygrophytes, non-pollen palynomorphs and geochemical analyses, supported by C-14 datings and multivariate statistics. The results indicate a complex pattern of ecological succession. During the local Iron Age the wetland was minerotrophic. Since similar to 20 AD it was subjected to dramatic hydrological changes due to a rise of the water-table, fluctuating between the presence of open water and phases of drawdown. Finally, by similar to 745 AD, the wetland experienced a rapid evolution towards ombrotrophic conditions. High grazing pressure was detected for the last decades. The significant change occurred during Early Roman Empire seems to have been the consequence of the direct use of the wetland as a water-reservoir of the canalisation system used for gold-mining. Thus, the current nature of the mire may be the result of human impact, although multiple human- and climate-induced causes were potentially linked to the detected shifts. However, the system seems to have been resilient, successfully buffering the changes without substantial alterations of its functioning. Our investigation shows that palaeoecological research is necessary to understand modifications in the structure of wetland ecosystems, their long-term ecology and the role of human-induced changes.

AB As natural sources of methane (CH4), peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Climate models predict that evapotranspiration will increase under a 2 x CO2 scenario due to increased temperatures leading to lowered water tables at many northern latitudes. Given that the position of the water table within a peatland can have a large effect on CH4 emissions, climate change may alter the CH4 emissions from peatlands in this area. Research was conducted during 2001-2003 on natural and drained (8 years prior) sites within a poor fen in central Quebec. Flux measurements were made for each site at different microtopographical features that varied in depth to water table and vegetation cover. The quantity of CH4 dissolved in the pore water was measured in the field and the potential of the peat for CH4 production and consumption was determined in the laboratory. Methane emissions and storage were lower in the drained fen. Growing season CH4 emissions at the drained site were 55% lower than the control site, primarily due to significantly reduced fluxes from topographic highs (up to 97% reduction), while the flux from topographically low areas remained high. The maintenance of high fluxes at these hollow sites was related to hydrological and ecological effects of the water table drawdown. The removal of standing water removed a potential zone of CH4 oxidation. It also enabled plant colonization at these locations, leading to an increase in gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP). At the hollow sites, seasonal CH4 emissions were significantly correlated to seasonal GEP (R-2 = 0.85). These results suggest that the response of northern peatland CH4 dynamics to climate change depends on the antecedent moisture conditions of the site. Moreover, ecological succession can play an important role for determining future CH4 emissions, particularly from wetter sites.

AB Anthropogenic landscape alterations have increased global carbon transported by rivers to oceans since preindustrial times. Few suitable observational data sets exist to distinguish different drivers of carbon increase, given that alterations only reveal their impact on fluvial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over long time periods. We use the world's longest record of DOC concentrations (130years) to identify key drivers of DOC change in the Thames basin (UK). We show that 90% of the long-term rise in fluvial DOC is explained by increased urbanization, which released to the river 671kt C over the entire period. This source of carbon is linked to rising population, due to increased sewage effluent. Soil disturbance from land use change explained shorter-term fluvial responses. The largest land use disturbance was during the Second World War, when almost half the grassland area in the catchment was converted into arable land, which released 45kt C from soils to the river. Carbon that had built up in soils over decades was released to the river in only a few years. Our work suggests that widespread population growth may have a greater influence on fluvial DOC trends than previously thought.

AB Peatland net ecosystem production is a key variable to assess changes in the functional role of peatlands in the global carbon cycle. Light use efficiency (LUE) models in combination with satellite data have been used to estimate production for most major ecosystems, but peatlands have been largely ignored. The objectives of this study were: 1) to examine how the LUE parameter epsilon, epsilon (the amount of carbon fixed or converted to biomass per unit absorbed photosynthetically active radiation), varies between and within four different peatlands; 2) to examine how the variations in epsilon relate to variations in environmental conditions; and 3) to evaluate a LUE-based model for estimation of epsilon in peatlands. We achieve these objectives using a combination of eddy covariance flux measurements, climate data and satellite data and estimate epsilon using the LUE-based vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM). The results show that: 1) mean site-specific flux-derived epsilon values (+/- standard deviation) were split into three statistically different groups: lowest values at the two colder fens, Kaamanen and Sandhill (0.22 +/- 0.18 and 0.23 +/- 0.20 g C MJ(-1), respectively), highest values at the treed fen La Biche (0.47 +/- 0.27 g C MJ(-1)) and intermediate values at the bog, Mer Bleue (0.34 +/- 0.18 g C MJ(-1)); 2) Variations in monthly epsilon within sites related mainly to air temperature, while variations in annual epsilon within sites related mainly to wetness variables; 3) relative mean absolute errors of estimates of s for the four sites ranged between 19% and 35%, with r(2) values ranging between 72% and 93%. LUE models are appealing as they are relatively simple formulations of variables that are easily obtained from satellite data. Challenges associated with the use of satellite data derived input variables are further discussed in the paper. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands are predicted to experience lowered water tables due to permafrost degradation in the Tibetan Plateau. These changes may affect carbon cycle processes such as soil respiration (R-s). However, the magnitude, patterns and controls of R-s remain poorly understood in alpine wetlands with their distinct hydrological regimes. Here, we conducted a field study on R-s from 2012 to 2014 in three alpine ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau-fen, wet meadow and meadow-with soil water decreases along hydrological gradients. From 2012 to 2014, the annual R-s was 128.9-193.3 g C m(-2)yr(-1), 281.5-342.9 g C m(-2)yr(-1), and 663.4-709.1 g C m(-2)yr(-1) for the fen, wet meadow, and meadow, respectively. An abrupt increase in CO2 emissions was caused by the spring thawing of the frozen soil in the fen and wet meadow, contributing 20.4-37.6% and 13.2-17.4%, respectively, to the annual R-s. The diurnal variation in the R-s was site specific among the three ecosystems, with one peak at 1300 h in the fen and meadow and two peaks at 1300 h and 1900 h in the wet meadow. The temperature-independent components of the diurnal variation in R-s were generally explained by photosynthetically active radiation in the fen and wet meadow, but not in the meadow. The temperature sensitivity of the R-s (unconfounded Q(10)) varied significantly among the three ecosystems, with the highest values occurring in the wet meadow, implying that permafrost thaw-induced wetland drying from the fen to the wet meadow could enhance the response of CO2 emissions to climate warming but that further drying from the wet meadow to the meadow probably weakens the effect of warming on the R-s. Our study emphasized the important role of the hydrological regime in regulating the temporal variation in R-s and its response to climate warming.

AB Broad-scale estimates of belowground biomass are needed to understand wetland resiliency and C and N cycling, but these estimates are difficult to obtain because root:shoot ratios vary considerably both within and between species. We used remotely-sensed estimates of two aboveground plant characteristics, aboveground biomass and % foliar N to explore biomass allocation in low diversity freshwater impounded peatlands (Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, CA, USA). We developed a hybrid modeling approach to relate remotely-sensed estimates of % foliar N (a surrogate for environmental N and plant available nutrients) and aboveground biomass to field-measured belowground biomass for species specific and mixed species models. We estimated up to 90% of variation in foliar N concentration using partial least squares (PLS) regression of full-spectrum field spectrometer reflectance data. Landsat 7 reflectance data explained up to 70% of % foliar N and 67% of aboveground biomass. Spectrally estimated foliar N or aboveground biomass had negative relationships with belowground biomass and root:shoot ratio in both Schoenoplectus acutus and Typha, consistent with a balanced growth model, which suggests plants only allocate growth belowground when additional nutrients are necessary to support shoot development. Hybrid models explained up to 76% of variation in belowground biomass and 86% of variation in root:shoot ratio. Our modeling approach provides a method for developing maps of spatial variation in wetland belowground biomass.

AB Rapid changes in atmospheric methane (CH4), temperature and precipitation are documented by Greenland ice core data both for glacial times (the so called Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events) as well as for a cooling event in the early Holocene (the 8.2 kyr event). The onsets of D-O warm events are paralleled by abrupt increases in CH4 by up to 250 ppb in a few decades. Vice versa, the 8.2 kyr event is accompanied by an intermittent decrease in CH4 of about 80 ppb over 150 yr. The abrupt CH4 changes are thought to mainly originate from source emission variations in tropical and boreal wet ecosystems, but complex process oriented bottom-up model estimates of the changes in these ecosystems during rapid climate changes are still missing. Here we present simulations of CH4 emissions from northern peatlands with the LPJ-Bern dynamic global vegetation model. The model represents CH4 production and oxidation in soils and transport by ebullition, through plant aerenchyma, and by diffusion. Parameters are tuned to represent site emission data as well as inversion-based estimates of northern wetland emissions. The model is forced with climate input data from freshwater hosing experiments using the NCAR CSM1.4 climate model to simulate an abrupt cooling event. A concentration reduction of similar to 10 ppb is simulated per degree K change of mean northern hemispheric surface temperature in peatlands. Peatland emissions are equally sensitive to both changes in temperature and in precipitation. If simulated changes are taken as an analogy to the 8.2 kyr event, boreal peatland emissions alone could only explain 23% of the 80 ppb decline in atmospheric methane concentration. This points to a significant contribution to source changes from low latitude and tropical wetlands to this event.

AB The aim of this study is to infer past changes in total organic carbon (TOC) content of lake water during the Holocene in eight boreal forest, tree-limit and alpine lakes using a new technique - near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). A training set of 100 lakes from northern Sweden covering a TOC gradient from 0.7 to 14.9 mg l(-1) was used to establish a relationship between the NIRS signal from surface sediments ( 0 - 1 cm) and the TOC content of the water mass. The NIRS model for TOC has a root mean squared error (RMSECV) of calibration of 1.6 mg l(-1) (11% of the gradient) assessed by internal cross-validation (CV), which yields an R-cv(2) of 0.61. The results show that the most dramatic change among the studied lakes occurs in both tree-line lakes around 1000 yrs BP when the TOC content decreases from ca. 7 to 3 mg l(-1) at the present, which is probably due to a descending tree-limit. The TOC content in the alpine lakes shows a declining trend throughout most of the Holocene indicating that TOC may be more directly correlated to climate in alpine lakes than forest lakes. All boreal forest lakes show a declining trend in TOC during the past 3000 yrs with the largest amplitude of change occurring in the lake with a connected mire. The results indicate that a change to a warmer and more humid climate can increase the TOC levels in lakes, which in turn may increase the saturation of CO2 in lake waters and the emission of CO2 to the atmosphere.

AB Soil organic matter, roots, rhizomes, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission rates were examined in minerogenic marshes of the North Inlet Estuary, a system dominated by sediment depositional processes and typical of the Southeast USA. Three marsh sites were sampled: a long-term nutrient enrichment experiment at Goat Island; the high marsh, low marsh, and creekbank of Crab Haul Creek, a fringing marsh that only receives drainage from a forested watershed; and three creekbank locations in Debidue Creek, which receives drainage from a residential and golf course development situated at its headwaters. Goat Island responses to 12 years of nutrient fertilization were an increase in soil organic matter (OM), an increase in number of rhizomes, enlarged rhizome diameters, and increased CO2 emission rates. At soil depths of 10-20 cm, all Debidue creekbank locations had significantly more rhizomes than the reference Crab Haul creekbank. The rhizome diameters at the mid and upper Debidue creekbank locations were significantly larger than the Debidue mouth and reference Crab Haul creekbank. The upper Debidue and the Crab Haul creekbanks had similar soil percent OM, which was significantly greater than the mid Debidue, which was greater than the Debidue mouth. CO2 emission rates at the fertilized Goat Island plots were similar in magnitude to the upper Debidue and significantly greater than the Goat Island control plots and the reference Crab Haul Creek. Inputs of sediment in marshes dominated by depositional processes may buffer the system from adverse effects of nutrient exposure, while increases in soil OM and rhizomes in response to nutrients may contribute to peat formation.

AB Four profiles of estuarine sediments obtained from boreholes drilled in the Algarve, Southern Portugal were studied in order to reconstruct the process of sediment accumulation driven by the postglacial sea level rise. In addition to the sedimentological analysis, the Foraminifera Index of Marine Influence (FIMI) permitted assessment of the nature and organization of sedimentary facies in the Beliche-Guadiana and Gilao-Almargem estuaries. The Beliche-Guadiana CM5 and Almargem G2 profiles accumulated in a sheltered environment, with the former presenting an almost continuous record of the sea level rise since ca 13 000 cal yr BP. The G1 and G3 profiles from the Gilao-Almargem area represent a more discontinuous record of the last 8000 years, which accumulated in the more dynamic environment of an outer estuary. The integration of all radiocarbon ages of dated levels, led to an estimate of sediment accumulation rates. Assuming a constant position of the sediment surface with respect to the tidal range and a negligible compaction of sediment, the sea level rose at the rate of 7 mm yr 1 in the period from 13 000 to 7500 cal yr BR This process slowed down to ca 0.9 mm yr(-1) from 7500 cal yr BP until the present. The marked historical change in the rate of sediment accumulation in these estuaries also occurred with the accumulation of organic matter and is, therefore, important data for global bio-geochemical models of carbon. The main obstacle to obtain higher temporal resolution of the sedimentary processes was the intense anaerobic respiration of organic matter via sulphate reduction, which did not allow any accumulation of peat and, furthermore, led to erasure of the palaeontological record by acid formed from the subsequent oxidation of sulphides.

AB Sphagnum mosses are keystone components of peatland ecosystems. They facilitate the accumulation of carbon in peat deposits, but climate change is predicted to expose peatland ecosystem to sustained and unprecedented warming leading to a significant release of carbon to the atmosphere. Sphagnum responses to climate change, and their interaction with other components of the ecosystem, will determine the future trajectory of carbon fluxes in peatlands. We measured the growth and productivity of Sphagnum in an ombrotrophic bog in northern Minnesota, where ten 12.8-m-diameter plots were exposed to a range of whole-ecosystem (air and soil) warming treatments (+0 to +9 degrees C) in ambient or elevated (+500 ppm) CO2. The experiment is unique in its spatial and temporal scale, a focus on response surface analysis encompassing the range of elevated temperature predicted to occur this century, and consideration of an effect of co-occurring CO2 altering the temperature response surface. In the second year of warming, dry matter increment of Sphagnum increased with modest warming to a maximum at 5 degrees C above ambient and decreased with additional warming. Sphagnum cover declined from close to 100% of the ground area to <50% in the warmest enclosures. After three years of warming, annual Sphagnum productivity declined linearly with increasing temperature (13-29 g C/m(2) per degrees C warming) due to widespread desiccation and loss of Sphagnum. Productivity was less in elevated CO2 enclosures, which we attribute to increased shading by shrubs. Sphagnum desiccation and growth responses were associated with the effects of warming on hydrology. The rapid decline of the Sphagnum community with sustained warming, which appears to be irreversible, can be expected to have many follow-on consequences to the structure and function of this and similar ecosystems, with significant feedbacks to the global carbon cycle and climate change.

AB The consequences of peat fires are complete or partial loss of soil fertility over a considerable area of land, decrease in biodiversity, razing of unique landscapes, deterioration of the conditions for life and health of the population, disturbed carbon cycle, increase in the greenhouse gas emissions, intensification of climate change, etc. Climatic tendencies of recent years will further contribute to increase in peat fires and their negative aftermaths. Therefore, prevention of peat fires and recultivation of burned-out peatlands are extremely important nature-protective measures. The objectives of the article was evaluation of current condition of burned peatlands of Volyn Oblast, their territorial distribution, dynamics according to years, analysis of potential threats for ecological safety and development of recommendations for prevention of peat fires and overcoming the negative consequences. During the study we used: methods of collecting material, methods of statistical analysis of results, cartographic methods, methods of expert assessment. We determined that the problem of peat fires and burned peatlands is extremely relevant for Volyn Oblast, requiring development of a complex of measures to solve it. As of 2002, the area of burned peatlands in the Oblast accounted for 440 ha. For the period of 2002-14, a total of 803 ha of burned peatlands was recorded across Volyn Oblast. In 2015-19, their area increased by another 280 ha. The largest areas of burned peatlands were found in Kamin-Kashyrskyi (137.9 ha), Liubeshiv (26.72 ha), Manevychi (20.35 ha) districts. We determined the tendency towards increase in the number of fires and areas of burned peatlands starting from 2018. To prevent peat fires, two-sided (wetting and drying) regulation of water regime within reclamation systems, alkalinization of peat soils, increase in their fertility, sanding-up of dried peat soils are proposed. Also, important measures include monitoring of burned peatlands and prevention of wildfires. In order to further use, rehabilitate and recultivate burned peatlands, it is suggested to t inventorise burned peatlands, assess economic and ecological damages, develop a plan of further use of territories, determine priorities of development and propose corresponding economic and nature-protection measures.

AB As an important long-term terrestrial carbon sequestration mechanism, biogeochemical sequestration of carbon within phytoliths may play a significant role in the global carbon cycle and climate change. The aim of this study is to explore the potential of carbon bio-sequestration within phytoliths produced by wetland plants. The results show that the occluded carbon content of phytoliths in wetland plants ranges from 0.49% to 3.97%, with a CV (coefficient of variation) value of 810%. The data also indicate that the phytolith-occluded carbon (PhytOC) content of biomass for wetland plants depends not only on the phytolith content of biomass, but also the efficiency of carbon occlusion within phytoliths during plant growth in herb-dominated fens. The fluxes of carbon bio-sequestration within phytoliths of herb-dominated fen plants range from 0.003 to 0.077 t CO2 equivalents t-e-CO2 ha(-1) a(-1). In China, 0.04x10(6) to 1.05x10(6) t CO2 equivalents per year may be sequestrated in phytoliths of herbaceous-dominated fen plants. Globally, taking a fen area of 1.48x10(8) ha and the largest phytolith carbon biosequestration flux (0.077 t-e-CO2 ha(-1) a(-1)) for herb-dominated fen plants, about 1.14x10(7) t CO2 equivalents per year would have been sequestrated in phytoliths of fen plants. If other wetland plants have similar PhytOC production flux with herb-dominated fen plants (0.077 t-e-CO2 ha(-1) a(-1)), about 4.39x10(7) t-e-CO2 a(-1) may be sequestrated in the phytoliths of world wetland plants. The data indicate that the management of wetland ecosystems (e.g. selection of plant species) to maximize the production of PhytOC have the potential to bio-sequestrate considerable quantities of atmospheric CO2.

AB Artificial wetlands are constructed around the globe for a variety of services, including wastewater treatment and carbon storage. To become a carbon sink, a newly constructed wetland must have a fully developed vegetation, consisting of species that can produce more organic matter than is being lost through decomposition. However, the effects of environmental conditions on the overall balance between production and decomposition might be complex. In this study, two large-scale field litterbag experiments were performed in a three-year old constructed wetland in the Netherlands, to separate the effects of litter characteristics and environmental conditions on decomposition rates of aquatic pioneer vegetation. Dimension reduction by principal component analysis was used to limit the number of variables for subsequent analyses in linear models. When transplanted to one common environment, litter characteristics alone could explain 52% and 26% of the variation in decomposition after 6 and 12 months, respectively. When both litter characteristics and environmental conditions were tested simultaneously and litter was decomposed in its original environment, 37% and 23% of the variation could be explained after 6 and 12 months, respectively. Both experiments showed two phases of decomposition: the initial leaching phase with an important role for litter characteristics and microbial communities in the model, and the second, slower phase, which is predominantly determined by litter characteristics and environmental conditions such as water quality. Model results could not be extrapolated to a fully developed reference area. Optimization of conditions in order to limit decomposition rates seems difficult and therefore we suggest using management options to influence biomass production and thereby fully exploit the use of newly constructed wetlands for carbon storage.

Fluorescence spectroscopy can detect groups of DOM compounds sensitive to these processes. However, different environmental gradients (e. g., redox, DOM provenance) can have confounding effects on DOM fluorescence spectra. This study shows how these confounding effects can be removed through discriminant analyses on parallel factor modeling results. Using statistically distinct end-members, we resolve spatiotemporal trends in redox potential and DOM provenance within and between adjacent vegetation communities in the patterned ridge and slough landscape of the Everglades, where biogeochemical differences between vegetation communities affect net peat accretion rates and persistence of landscape structure. Source discrimination of DOM in whole-water samples and peat leachates reveals strong temporal variability associated with seasonality and passage of a hurricane and indicates that hurricane effects on marsh biogeochemistry persist for longer periods of time (>1 year) than previously recognized. Using the DOM source signal as a hydrologic tracer, we show that the system is hydrologically well mixed when surface water is present, and that limited transport of flocculent detritus occurs in surface flows. Redox potential discrimination shows that vertical redox gradients are shallower on ridges than in sloughs, creating an environment more favorable to decomposition and diagenesis. The sensitivity, high resolution, rapidity, and precision of these statistical analyses of DOM fluorescence spectra establish the technique as a promising performance measure for restoration or indicator of carbon cycle processes in the Everglades and aquatic ecosystems worldwide.

AB River floodplains constitute an important element in the terrestrial sediment and organic carbon cycle and store variable amounts of carbon and sediment depending on a complex interplay of internal and external driving forces. Quantifying the storage in floodplains is crucial to understand their role in the sediment and carbon cascades. Unfortunately, quantitative data on floodplain storage are limited, especially at larger spatial scales. Rivers in the Scottish Highlands can provide a special case to study alluvial sediment and carbon dynamics because of the dominance of peatlands throughout the landscape, but the alluvial history of the region remains poorly understood. In this study, the floodplain sediment and soil organic carbon storage is quantified for the mountainous headwaters of the River Dee in eastern Scotland (663 km(2)), based on a coring dataset of 78 floodplain cross-sections. Whereas the mineral sediment storage is dominated by wandering gravel-bed river sections, most of the soil organic carbon storage can be found in anastomosing and meandering sections. The total storage for the Upper Dee catchment can be estimated at 5.2 Mt or 2306.5 Mg ha(-1) of mineral sediment and 0.7 Mt or 323.3 Mg C ha(-1) of soil organic carbon, which is in line with other studies on temperate river systems. Statistical analysis indicates that the storage is mostly related to the floodplain slope and the geomorphic floodplain type, which incorporates the characteristic stream power, channel morphology and the deposit type. Mapping of the geomorphic floodplain type using a simple classification scheme shows to be a powerful tool in studying the total storage and local variability of mineral sediment and soil organic carbon in floodplains.

AB Soil respiration is a main dynamic process of carbon cycle in wetland. It is important to contribute to global climate changes. Water table and nutritious availability are significant impact factors to influence responses of CO2 emission from wetland soil to climate changes. Twenty-four wetland soil monoliths at 4 water-table positions and in 3 nitrogen status have been incubated to measure rates of CO2 emission from wetland soils in this study. Three static water-table controls and a fluctuant water-table control, with 3 nitrogen additions in every water-table control, were carried out. In no nitrogen addition treatment, high CO2 emissions were found at a static low water table (I) and a fluctuant water table (IV), averaging 306.7mg/(m(2).h) and 307.89mg/(m(2).h), respectively, which were 51%-57% higher than that at static high water table (II and III). After nitrogen addition, however, highest CO2 emission was found at II and lowest emission at III. The results suggested that nutritious availability of wetland soil might be important to influence the effect of water table on the CO2, emission from the wetland soil. Nitrogen addition led to enhancing CO2 emissions from wetland soil, while the highest emission was found in 1N treatments other than in 2N treatments. In 3 nutritious treatments, low CO2 emissions at high water tables and high CO2 emissions at low water tables were also observed when water table fluctuated. Our results suggested that both water table changes and nutritious imports would effect the CO2 emission from wetland.

AB Surface air temperature and precipitation records for the years 1958-1999 from ten meteorological stations located throughout West Siberia are used to identify climatic trends and determine to what extent these trends are potentially attributable to the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Although recent changes in atmospheric variability are associated with broad Arctic climate change, West Siberia appears particularly susceptible to warming. Furthermore, unlike most of the Arctic, moisture transport in the region is highly variable. The records show that West Siberia is experiencing significant warming and notable increases in precipitation, likely driven, in part, by large-scale Arctic atmospheric variability. Because this region contains a large percentage of the world's peatlands and contributes a significant portion of the total terrestrial freshwater flux to the Arctic Ocean, these recent climatic trends may have globally significant repercussions. The most robust patterns found are strong and prevalent springtime warming, winter precipitation increases, and strong association of non-summer air temperatures with the AO. Warming rates for both spring (0.5-0.8degreesC/decade) and annual (0.3-0.5degreesC/decade) records are statistically significant for nine of ten stations. On average, the AO is linearly congruent with 96% (winter), 19% (spring), 0% (summer), 67% (autumn) and 53% (annual) of the warming found in this study. Significant trends in precipitation occur most commonly during winter, when four of ten stations exhibit significant increases (4-13%/decade). The AO may play a lesser role in precipitation variability and is linearly congruent with only 17% (winter), 13% (spring), 12% (summer), 1% (autumn) and 26% (annual) of precipitation trends.

AB Characteristics Of CO2-C exchange were studied in a temperate herbaceous wetland in 2006 and 2007, years with contrasting hydrological regimes. The wetland Mokre Louky (the "Wet Meadows" near Trebon), Czech Republic (49 degrees 01'30 '' N, 14 degrees 46'20 '' E) is a sedge-grass marsh dominated by Carex acuta L The site is situated in the inundation area of a large human-made lake (Rozmberk fishpond, 5 km(2)). The water table is near the soil surface and is fairly stable throughout the year (+/- 0.1 m), except for flood events, when it can reach up to 2 m above the soil surface. Net ecosystem production (NEP) was calculated from the CO2 fluxes measured by the eddy-covariance technique and was compared with the seasonal course of plant live aboveground biomass. The results show that: (1) the annual net uptake Of CO2-C Was 199 and 220 g C m(-1) yr(-1) in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The daily net CO2-C uptake reached 12-20 g C m(-2) day(-1) in sunny summer days. These values are among the highest values reported for wetlands of the northern hemisphere. (2) Although the observed wetland is adapted to floods, the summer flood substantially reduced its net CO2-C uptake. The daily courses of net CO2-C uptake point to reduced rates Of CO2-C fixation by the vegetation cover. (3) A recovery growth of plant biomass was associated with a second peak of NEP in September 2006. (4) Lack of knowledge on the dynamics of methane emissions presently limits deeper understanding of the effect of floods on carbon balance in wetlands. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Net ecosystem exchange of CO2 was measured at a temperate peatland in southeastern New Hampshire. Classified as a mineral-poor fen owing to deep, water-logged peats that are influenced to a limited extent by groundwater, the ecosystem is dominated by plants such as sedges (Carex spp.) and evergreen shrubs. Ten automatic chambers measured fluxes every 3 h by sampling changes in headspace concentration of CO2 from November 2000 through March 2001. The fen was covered in snow for most of this period and CO2 was emitted from the snow pack throughout the winter. The largest fluxes were associated with ground temperatures of 0 degreesC and with declining atmospheric pressure. CO2 effluxes up to 3 mumol m(-2) s(-1) were recorded when the ground temperature reached the thaw point. Fluxes were lower when the ground temperature rose above 0 degreesC, however, suggesting that the large fluxes were associated with a build up and release of stored CO2 degassing as soon as the ground thawed, or by enhanced microbial activity associated with freeze-thaw dynamics. The large number of thaw events coupled with frequent short-term releases of CO2 suggest that degassing occurred on a regular basis with changes in atmospheric pressure and/or microbial decomposition occurred beneath the snowpack. The extent of soil freezing prior to thaw was also an important factor, with colder soils yielding smaller CO2 emissions upon thaw. Although most of the observed CO2 flux was efflux from the ecosystem, occasional CO2 uptake by the ecosystem of up to 1 mumol m(-2) s(-1) was also observed, indicating small rates of photosynthesis even during winter. Photosynthesis occurred only when the ground temperature was >0 degreesC. The implications for a warmer climate are unclear. If warmer winter temperatures yield less snow in the temperate region, then soils could freeze more deeply and result in lower CO2 emissions. However, if less snow results in a higher frequency of freeze-thaw events, then winter CO2 emissions could be larger with a warmer climate. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The paper describes the process ofn-butanol abatement by unicellular fungi, able to deplete n-butanol content in gas, by usingn-butanol as source of carbon. Isolated and identified fungi speciesCandida albicansandCandida subhashiiwere subjected to a viability process via assimilation of carbon from hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds. The isolates, which exhibited the ability to assimilate carbon, were immobilized on four different types of artificial support materials used for biotrickling filtration. Application of optical microscopy, flow cytometry and the tests employing propidium iodide and annexin V revealed viability of the fungi isolated on support materials' surfaces at the average level of 95%. The proposed method of immobilization and its evaluation appeared to be effective, cheap and fast. Based on performed comparative analyses, it was shown that polyurethane foam and Bialecki rings (25 x 25) could be attractive support materials in biotrickling filtration.

AB This paper addresses the issue of polishing electroplating wastewater in subsurface vertical flow constructed wetland. Electroplating wastewater treatment or polishing in constructed wetlands (CWs) was studied to a very limited degree. Four types of microcosm upflow constructed wetlands were selected for the experiment based on type of bed media and the presence or absence of vegetation (Phragmites australis). The main objective of the system design was to promote metals removal by precipitation as sulfides mediated by sulfate reducing bacteria. The experimental system consisted of eight PVC columns (diameter 20 cm) filled up to. 63.5 cm with either gravel or gravel-peat mixture and was operated for one year, polishing synthetic electroplating wastewater. The wastewater used in this study contained metals (Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn), cyanides and sulfates, which typically occur in electroplating wastewater. During the experiment the effect of the following factors was studied: presence of vegetation, hydraulic loading, wastewater strength, type of bed media, and addition of lactates as external carbon source for the columns with gravel. The results showed that the upflow columns can efficiently remove metals (with the exception of Pb) and cyanides. It was observed that the removal efficiency of Cu, Ni and Zn increases with increasing influent concentration of metals and increasing hydraulic loading rate. The role of plants and bed media was minor. The addition of lactates to the feed of the columns with gravel was found to improve the reduction of metals concentration in the passing wastewater.

AB Ecosystems exchange climate-relevant trace gases with the atmosphere, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are a small but highly reactive part of the carbon cycle. VOCs have important ecological functions and implications for atmospheric chemistry and climate. We measured the ecosystem-level surface-atmosphere VOC fluxes using the eddy covariance technique at a shallow subarctic lake and an adjacent graminoid-dominated fen in northern Sweden during two contrasting periods: the peak growing season (mid-July) and the senescent period post-growing season (September-October).
   In July, the fen was a net source of methanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, dimethyl sulfide, isoprene, and monoterpenes. All of these VOCs showed a did cycle of emission with maxima around noon and isoprene dominated the fluxes (93 +/- 22 mu mol m(-2) d(-1), mean +/- SE). Isoprene emission was strongly stimulated by temperature and presented a steeper response to temperature (Q(10) = 14.5) than that typically assumed in biogenic emission models, supporting the high temperature sensitivity of arctic vegetation. In September, net emissions of methanol and isoprene were drastically reduced, while acetaldehyde and acetone were deposited to the fen, with rates of up to -6.7 +/- 2.8 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) for acetaldehyde.
   Remarkably, the lake was a sink for acetaldehyde and acetone during both periods, with average fluxes up to -19 +/- 1.3 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) of acetone in July and up to -8.5 +/- 2.3 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) of acetaldehyde in September. The deposition of both carbonyl compounds correlated with their atmospheric mixing ratios, with deposition velocities of -0.23 +/- 0.01 and -0.68 +/- 0.03 cm s(-1) for acetone and acetaldehyde, respectively.
   Even though these VOC fluxes represented less than 0.5 % and less than 5 % of the CO2 and CH4 net carbon ecosystem exchange, respectively, VOCs alter the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere. Thus, understanding the response of their emissions to climate change is important for accurate prediction of the future climatic conditions in this rapidly warming area of the planet.

AB Peatlands contain a carbon stock of global concern and significantly contribute to the global methane burden. The impact of drought and rewetting on carbon cycling in peatland ecosystems is thus currently debated. We studied the impact of experimental drought and rewetting on intact monoliths from a temperate fen over a period of similar to 300 days, using a permanently wet treatment and two treatments undergoing drought for 50 days. In one of the mesocosms, vegetation had been removed. Net production of CH4 was calculated from mass balances in the peat and emission using static chamber measurements. Results were compared to C-13 isotope budgets of CO2 and CH4 and energy yields of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Drought retarded methane production after rewetting for days to weeks and promoted methanotrophic activity. Based on isotope and flux budgets, aerobic soil respiration contributed 32-96% in the wet treatment and 86-99% in the other treatments. Drying and rewetting did not shift methanogenic pathways according to delta C-13 ratios of CH4 and CO2. Although delta C-13 ratios indicated a prevalence of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, free energies of this process were small and often positive on the horizon scale. This suggests that methane was produced very locally. Fresh plant-derived carbon input apparently supported respiration in the rhizosphere and sustained methanogenesis in the unsaturated zone, according to a C-13-CO2 labelling experiment. The study documents that drying and rewetting in a rich fen soil may have little effect on methanogenic pathways, but result in rapid shifts between methanogenesis and methanotrophy. Such shifts may be promoted by roots and soil heterogeneity, as hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis occurred locally even when conditions were not conducive for this process in the bulk peat.

AB Wetland methane (CH4) emissions are the largest natural source in the global CH4 budget, contributing to roughly one third of total natural and anthropogenic emissions. As the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas in the atmosphere after CO2, CH4 is strongly associated with climate feedbacks. However, due to the paucity of data, wetland CH4 feedbacks were not fully assessed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report. The degree to which future expansion of wetlands and CH4 emissions will evolve and consequently drive climate feedbacks is thus a question of major concern. Here we present an ensemble estimate of wetland CH4 emissions driven by 38 general circulation models for the 21st century. We find that climate change-induced increases in boreal wetland extent and temperature-driven increases in tropical CH4 emissions will dominate anthropogenic CH4 emissions by 38 to 56% toward the end of the 21st century under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP2.6). Depending on scenarios, wetland CH4 feedbacks translate to an increase in additional global mean radiative forcing of 0.04W.m(-2) to 0.19W.m(-2) by the end of the 21st century. Under the "worst-case" RCP8.5 scenario, with no climate mitigation, boreal CH4 emissions are enhanced by 18.05 Tg to 41.69 Tg, due to thawing of inundated areas during the cold season (December to May) and rising temperature, while tropical CH4 emissions accelerate with a total increment of 48.36 Tg to 87.37 Tg by 2099. Our results suggest that climate mitigation policies must consider mitigation of wetland CH4 feedbacks to maintain average global warming below 2 degrees C.

AB Knowledge of the environmental controls of carbon dioxide fluxes is essential for understanding the dynamics of carbon exchange between ecosystems and atmosphere. In this study we investigated soil respiration and moss photosynthesis as well as their contribution to the net carbon dioxide flux of two different wet tundra systems. During two summers, in situ carbon dioxide fluxes were measured in a tussock tundra and in a low-centre polygonal tundra on Taimyr Peninsula, central Siberia. Measurements were carried out by means of a multichannel gas exchange system. Results show pronounced differences in soil respiration rates as related to microscale topography, mainly due to differences of soil water table and soil temperatures. Modelling of soil respiration for individual microsites revealed differences of process performance with respect to both factors. The wet microsites showed the highest potential regarding an increase of soil respiration rates in warmer and drier climate change scenarios. Another important process compensating the CO2 release from the soil was the photosynthesis of the moss layer, assimilating as much as 51% to 98% of the daily amount of carbon dioxide released from wet tundra soils. This result demonstrates the importance of mosses in the context of tundra ecosystem processes. The magnitude of net system fluxes of the whole system at the depression of the polygonal tundra was strongly influenced by changes in soil water table. Consequently, any changes of the hydrology, as anticipated in the context of global change, would effectively alter the carbon balance of wet tundra systems.

AB Previous studies have shown that atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is detrimental to sphagna, which are a group of mosses that are important for carbon cycling in northern peatlands. Little is known about species interactions, such as relative responses of tall moss Polytrichum strictum Menzies ex Brid. and sphagna. We studied the effects of N deposition on growth, abundance, and CO2 exchange of the moss species Sphagnum capillifolium (Ehrh.) Hedw. and Polytrichum strictum in an experiment at a temperate bog. Sphagnum growth and cover decreased significantly with high-dose N treatment (6.4 g N.m(-2).year(-1)) in years 4 and 5 of treatment, whereas the same parameters increased for Polytrichum compared with the control. Net CO2 exchange, gross photosynthesis (P-g), and dark respiration (R) in the intact moss cores, which were measured in year 5 of treatment, were elevated in the cores that had been treated with the high-dose of N, compared with the control, and this was associated with increased abundance of Polytrichum. The moss cores where Polytrichum was removed, however, had increased mass-based R with the high-dose N treatment. Our results showed that S. capillifolium at Mer Bleue may be close to N saturation, as 5 years of high-dose N loading (6.4 g N.m(-2).year(-1) + background) was harmful to this species, possibly as a result of increased respiratory cost. Polytrichum strictum had a competitive advantage, at least in the short-term, through allocating excess N to growth. This change in moss layer composition deserves further attention, as a shift to more easily decomposable litter, without corresponding increases in plant production, could reduce the carbon sequestration of the bog.

AB Wildfire in boreal permafrost peatlands causes a thickening and warming of the seasonally thawed active layer, exposing large amounts of soil carbon to microbial processes and potential release as greenhouse gases. In this study, conducted in the discontinuous permafrost zone of western Canada, we monitored soil thermal regime and soil respiration throughout the 2016 growing season at an unburned peat plateau and two nearby peat plateaus that burned 16 and 9 years prior to the study. Maximum seasonal soil temperature at 40 cm depth was 4 ;C warmer in the burned sites, and active layers were ?90 cm thicker compared to the unburned site. Despite the deeper and warmer seasonally thawed active layer, we found higher soil respiration in the unburned site during the first half of the growing season. We partitioned soil respiration into contribution from shallow and deep peat using a model driven by soil temperatures at 10 and 40 cm depths. Cumulative estimated deep soil respiration throughout the growing season was four times greater in the burned sites than in the unburned site, 32 and 8 g C m(?2) respectively. Concurrently, cumulative shallow soil respiration was estimated to be lower in the burned than unburned site, 49 and 80 g C m(?2) respectively, likely due to the removal of the microbially labile soil carbon in the shallow peat. Differences in deep contribution to soil respiration were supported by radiocarbon analysis in fall. With effects of wildfire on soil thermal regime lasting for up to 25 years in these ecosystems, we conclude that increased loss of deep, old, soil carbon during this period is of similar magnitude as the direct carbon losses from combustion during wildfire and thus needs to be considered when assessing overall impact of wildfire on carbon cycling in permafrost peatlands.

AB Water table fluctuations influence the carbon balance of wetlands, but the effects are difficult to isolate and quantify in field investigations. Thus, we compared C mineralization in a peatland mesocosm exposed to a water table fluctuation (from 5 to 67 cm beneath the surface) with that in mesocosms with a stable high water table (2 to 6 cm depth) and with production rates obtained from flask incubations. Net turnover rates were calculated from concentration data by diffusive-advective mass-balances. Under stable, high water table conditions, net production of CO2 (6.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), CH4 (2.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and DOC (15.4 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) were vertically stratified and production and fluxes equilibrated. Lowering and raising the water table from 5 to 67 cm resulted in complex patterns of net CH4 and CO2 production. Response and equilibration times of processes upon drainage and flooding ranged from days (aerobic CO, production, CH4 oxidation, fluxes under unsaturated conditions) to months (CH4 production, fluxes under saturated conditions). Averaged over the water table fluctuation, net production of CH4 decreased to 0.36 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and that of CO2 increased to 140 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Physical disturbance through the incubation of peat strongly increased production rates of CO2, CH4 and DOC compared to in situ, steady state rates. The decoupling of production and fluxes to the atmosphere under conditions with variable water table depths potentially explains part of the frequently reported lack of correlation between environmental variables and trace gas fluxes in field investigations, and questions the applicability of predictions of gas flux based on empirical relationships established under stable average conditions.

AB Peatlands host a large number of highly specialised species and are important carbon storage and freshwater reservoirs, but are heavily threatened by, e.g., peat extraction and drainage. For improved protection of peatlands, the development of an ecological assessment system is necessary. Existing systems based, for instance, on peat formation and water level are rather coarse and differ between countries. The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate the predictive power of biodiversity indicators - particularly invertebrates (Oribatida, Araneae, Carabidae) and vegetation - for more finely reflecting environmental conditions in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in order to determine which taxonomic groups should be included in an ecological assessment system for peatlands. Therefore, we selected three plots in each of four peatland study sites in a German low mountain range and sampled the taxonomic groups using standard methods appropriate to represent assemblage structure and site diversity (Oribatida: Sphagnum samples; Araneae, Carabidae: pitfalls traps; vegetation: vegetation surveys). Our results indicate the necessity of implementing different taxonomic groups into an overall ecological assessment system, as all of them reacted differently to different ecological gradients. Oribatid mites were the best predictors of moisture, one of the most important factors in peatlands. Ground-dwelling spiders responded to several different factors; most remarkably, they strongly correlated with landscape area covered by peatland-related Natura 2000 habitat types, as a proxy for habitat quality. Carabidae most strongly correlated with the size of the Sphagnum plots, moss cover and moisture, but their species richness was very low. Vegetation, as the best established indicator group in peatlands, showed the weakest correlations to the tested environmental parameters, probably due to short-term changes in environmental conditions and a delayed response of the plant community. Hence, the set of most relevant environmental parameters can only be represented when multiple taxa are included in an assessment system. Also, overall biodiversity is not represented by a single taxon, because the correlation in assemblage similarity between the taxonomic groups was low. Considering ecological sensitivity, sampling effort (=number of samples and necessary site visits), taxonomic stability and state of knowledge on species' habitat requirements, we therefore suggest the inclusion of ground-dwelling spiders, oribatid mites and vegetation in an ecological assessment system for peatlands, complemented by a few sensitive, easy to recognize indicator species of other taxonomic groups.

AB Wildfire represents the largest areal disturbance of forested boreal peatlands and the spatial variability in the severity of these peat fires is both a leading source of uncertainty in boreal wildfire carbon emissions and a major challenge for regional wildfire management. Peat smoldering can emit large quantities of carbon and smoke to the atmosphere, and therefore can contribute to hazardous air quality. The wildland-industry interface and wildland-urban interface are both extensive across the sub-humid boreal plains (BP) ecozone where one-third of the area is covered by peatlands. As such, there is a growing research need to identify drivers of variability in smoldering combustion. This study uses hydrophysical peat properties to assess the drivers of cross-scale variability in peat smoldering combustion vulnerability in forested peatlands across the BP. Using a space-for-time chronosequence across the 120 year fire return interval and three main hydrogeological settings, and by incorporating hummock, hollow and margin locations, cross-scale variability is studied. We find that, based on peat properties such as specific yield (Sy) and gravimetric water content, forested peatland margins represent areas of high peat smoldering vulnerability, and that this is exacerbated with an increasing time-since-fire (stand-age). Although increasing Sy with time-since-fire in peatland middles may buffer water table drawdown, when accounting for increases in canopy fuel load, transpiration, and feather moss dominance forested peatland middles also become more vulnerable to smoldering combustion with time-since-fire. Moreover, the interaction of peatland margins with coarse- and heterogeneous-grained hydrogeological settings leads to lower Sy and higher density margin peat than in fine-grained settings, further increasing smoldering vulnerability. We estimate that forested peatland margins are vulnerable to combustion throughout their entire profile i.e., burn-out, under moderate-high water deficits in the BP. Furthermore, we identify peatland margin: total area ratio as a driver of smoldering vulnerability where small peatlands that are periodically disconnected from regional groundwater systems are the most vulnerable to high total peat carbon loss. We suggest that these drivers of cross-scale variability should be incorporated into peatland and wildfire management strategies, especially in areas near the wildland-industry and wildland-urban interface.

AB CO2 production in terrestrial ecosystems is generally assumed to be solely biologically driven while the role of abiotic processes has been largely overlooked. In addition to microbial decomposition, photodegradation - the direct breakdown of organic matter (OM) by solar irradiance - has been found to contribute to litter mass loss in dry ecosystems. Previous small-scale studies have shown that litter degradation by irradiance is accompanied by emissions of CO2. However, the contribution of photodegradation to total CO2 losses at ecosystems scales is unknown. This study determined the proportion of the total CO2 losses caused by photodegradation in two ecosystems: a bare peatland in New Zealand and a seasonally dry grassland in California. The direct effect of solar irradiance on CO2 production was examined by comparing daytime CO2 fluxes measured using eddy covariance (EC) systems with simultaneous measurements made using an opaque chamber and the soil CO2 gradient technique, and with night-time EC measurements under the same soil temperature and moisture conditions. In addition, a transparent chamber was used to directly measure CO2 fluxes from OM caused by solar irradiance. Photodegradation contributed 19% of the annual CO2 flux from the peatland and almost 60% of the dry season CO2 flux from the grassland, and up to 62% and 92% of the summer mid-day CO2 fluxes, respectively. Our results suggest that photodegradation may be important in a wide range of ecosystems with exposed OM. Furthermore, the practice of partitioning daytime ecosystem CO2 exchange into its gross components by assuming that total daytime CO2 losses can be approximated using estimates of biological respiration alone may be in error. To obtain robust estimates of global ecosystem-atmosphere carbon transfers, the contribution of photodegradation to OM decomposition must be quantified for other ecosystems and the results incorporated into coupled carbon-climate models.

AB The impacts of vegetation fires on ecosystems are complex and varied affecting a range of important ecosystem services. Fire has the potential to affect the physicochemical and ecological status of water systems, alter several aspects of the carbon cycle (e.g. above- and below-ground carbon storage) and trigger changes in vegetation type and structure. Globally, fire is an essential part of land management in fire-prone regions in, e.g. Australia, the USA and some Mediterranean countries to mitigate the likelihood of catastrophic wildfires and sustain healthy ecosystems. In the less-fire prone UK, fire has a long history of usage in management for enhancing the productivity of heather, red grouse and sheep. This distinctly different socioeconomic tradition of burning underlies some of the controversy in recent decades in the UK around the use of fire. Negative public opinion and opposition from popular media have highlighted concerns around the detrimental impacts burning can have on the health and diversity of upland habitats. It is evident there are many gaps in the current knowledge around the environmental impacts of prescribed burning in less fire-prone regions (e.g. UK). Land owners and managers require a greater level of certainty on the advantages and disadvantages of prescribed burning in comparison to other techniques to better inform management practices. This paper addresses this gap by providing a critical review of published work and future research directions related to the impacts of prescribed fire on three key aspects of ecosystem services: (i) water quality, (ii) carbon dynamics and (iii) habitat composition and structure (biodiversity). Its overall aims are to provide guidance based on the current state-of-the-art for researchers, land owners, managers and policy makers on the potential effects of the use of burning and to inform the wider debate about the place of fire in modern conservation and land management in humid temperate ecosystems.

AB Humic acids (HA) are organic macromolecules of high structural complexity and are primarily obtained from non-renewable carbon sources such as peat and coal. HA is widely used in agriculture but is known to have therapeutic properties, which are still poorly explored. Previous studies have shown the potential of biotechnological processes in the production of HA in submerged fermentation (SF) and solid-state fermentation (SSF) using pre-treated fibers of oil palm of empty fruit bunch (EFB) for the cultivation of Trichoderma strains. EFB is an agro-industrial residue that is readily available at a low cost. The present study aimed to study the production of HA by Trichoderma reesei in the SSF of raw fibers of EFBs from two different palm oil producers. Profiles of HA production, cellular protein, pH, glucose, moisture, and oxygen transfer were obtained during SSF by EFB with and without lipids, as well as, images by electron microscopy of fibers. Results showed efficient HA production in the raw fibers of the EFBs. HA production followed the cellular protein (6 g HA per 100 g of fibers) evolution of the fermentations in the absence of lipids, while the composition of lipids greatly affected its production. The best HA production (350 mg HA per 100 g of fibers) was obtained from EFB that was richer in lignocellulosics and the residual lipids were similar to the fractions of palm and kernel oils, while EFB with lower lignocellulosic presented a production 110 mg HA per 100 g of fibers.

AB Northern peatlands are sinks for atmospheric carbon (C), but peat extraction converts these ecosystems to C sources. Due to a dry regional climate, undisturbed bog peatlands in western Canada often have a tree cover of Picea mariana (Mill.) B. S. P. Thus, a coniferous forest plantation may be an appropriate land use for cutover peatlands. This study determined the effect of a 7-year-old P. mariana plantation on C balance of a cutover peatland. We measured C stored in P. mariana biomass and carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes from bare peat at each of four fertilizer doses. Carbon stored in biomass of Betula papyrifera (Marsh.) that had spontaneously colonized the postfertilized site was also determined. Given that the water table remained very deep and that the sphagnum moss-ericaceous shrub peat-accumulating vegetation was not present, the site remained a source of C when only the planted P. mariana trees were considered, primarily in the form of CO2 emissions by soil respiration. However, C accumulation in trees, including B. papyrifera biomass, resulted in a net C sink in fertilized plots. Results from this study indicate that tree plantations on cutover peatland may be a suitable land-management strategy on sites difficult to effectively rewet.

AB Aims
   Our objective was to investigate how the after-effects of a heatwave interacted with nutrient addition in affecting the vegetation of an alpine mire. We also aimed to assess if the responses of vegetation to the environmental changes differed between mire habitats.
   Location
   A mire in the Dolomites (southeastern Alps, Italy, 1800m a.s.l.).
   Methods
   We carried out an 8-yr (2002-2009) experiment of nutrient addition in an alpine mire that experienced, in summer 2003, an unprecedented heatwave. The cover of vascular plants and mosses was assessed non-destructively and the presence of all vascular plant and moss species was recorded in 60 plots.
   Results
   Interacting effects of the heatwave and experimental fertilization brought about profound changes in the vegetation of the mire. Patterns of change varied considerably between two habitats (hummocks and lawns). In the short term (2003-2005), the 2003 heatwave triggered a change in vegetation structure and PFT cover, with vascular plants expanding at the expense of mosses in both habitats. In the mid-term (2005-2009), moss cover increased in hummocks because Sphagnum mosses recovered and non-Sphagnum mosses expanded, especially under N addition. Conversely, in lawns vascular plants expanded while mosses did not recover. These trends were strengthened when N was added with no concomitant P addition. A decline in species richness was observed in lawns, most likely due to stronger interactions among species.
   Conclusions
   Hummocks have a greater ability than lawns to recover from extreme climatic events under higher levels of N influx. Conversely, a persistent increase in vascular plant cover at the expense of moss cover in lawns may jeopardize the carbon sink function of lawn habitats.

AB Altitudinal gradients are useful to study the potential effects of climate change on ecosystems. Historically, studies on elevation gradients have primarily focused on macro-organisms and ecosystem processes, while microorganisms have been mostly ignored despite their ubiquity and functional importance. We studied the temporal (about every two months from June 2008 until May 2009) variation of testate amoeba communities in four Sphagnum-dominated peatlands along a 1300 to elevation gradient in the Swiss Mountains (580-1880 m) in relation to water table depth and hydrochemistry with special focus on dissolved organic carbon (DOC), a useful proxy for changes in C-cycling in peatlands.
   The lowest site had significantly (P < 0.01) lowest testate amoeba density, species richness. The highest site had highest testate amoeba density (38 ind mg(-1) dry mass of Sphagnum). Seasonal fluctuations in testate amoeba species richness and diversity were not consistent among sites but density tended to peak in spring at all sites, autumn in the three highest sites and mid-winter in the upper two sites. In a redundancy analysis (RDA) community structure was more strongly correlated to altitude (33.8% of variance explained in living community) than to soil hydrological and hydro-chemical variables (together explaining 16.2% of variance). In a partial RDA with altitude used as covariable, the four sites were separated by DOP, DOC, DON, pH and average depth to water table.
   The abundance of high trophic level testate amoeba species (shell-aperture over their body size >0.20; i.e. primarily predators of protists and micro-metazoa) as well as the community size structure increased from lowest to highest elevation (respectively by 3.7x and 6x) and followed the seasonal patterns of total density, while DOC, DON, and DOC/DON decreased with elevation.
   These results agree with previously reported alteration of peatland microbial food chains in response to experimental warming, suggesting that climate-induced changes in microbial community structure (here a shortening of microbial food chains) represent a mechanism controlling the carbon balance of peatlands.

AB Microcosms of a boreal peatland originating from an oligotrophic fen in Eastern Finland were fumigated under four ozone concentrations (0, 50, 100 and 150 ppb O-3) in laboratory growth chambers during two separate experiments (autumn and summer) for 4 and 6 weeks, respectively. Ozone effects on Sphagnum mosses and the fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane were evaluated. In both experiments, the three Sphagnum species studied showed only a few significant responses to ozone. In the autumn experiment, membrane permeability of S. angustifolium, measured as conductivity and magnesium leakage, was significantly higher under ozone fumigation (P = 0.005 and < 0.001, respectively), and there was a distinct dose-dependence. S. magellanicum showed no clear responses, either for membrane leakage or pigment content. There were no substantial ozone responses in the gross photosynthesis or net CO2 exchange during the 6-week-long summer experiment, but dark ecosystem respiration was transiently increased by ozone concentration of 100 ppb after 14 days of exposure (P < 0.05). Fumigation with 100 ppb of ozone, however, more than doubled (P < 0.05) methane emission from the peatland monoliths. Our results suggest that increasing tropospheric ozone concentration may cause substantial changes in the carbon gas cycling of boreal peatlands, even though these changes are not closely associated with the changes in Sphagnum vegetation.

AB Methane emissions and below ground methane pore water concentrations were determined in an alpine fen at 1,915 m a.s.l. in central Switzerland. The fen represented an acidic (pH 4.5-4.9), nutrient-poor to mesotrophic habitat dominated by Carex limosa, Carex rostrata, Trichophorum caespitosum and Sphagnum species. From late fall to late spring the fen was snow-covered. Throughout winter the temperatures never dropped below 0A degrees C at 5 cm below the vegetation surface. Methane emissions in June, July, August and September were in the range of 125 (+/- 26)-313 (+/- 71) mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) with a tendency to decrease along the summer season. Mean methane pore water concentrations at a depth of 20-40 cm below the vegetation surface were 526 (+/- 32) mu M in June and in the range of 144 (+/- 10)-233 (+/- 7) mu M in July, August and September. At a depth of 0-20 cm the mean methane pore water concentrations dropped back to < 20 mu M with an almost linear decrease between 0 and 15 cm. Oxygen pore water concentrations were close to air saturation in the first few centimeters and dropped back below detection limit at a depth of 20 cm. In July and August the pore water concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were in the range of 7.2-10.1 mg C l(-1) at all depths. The pore water concentrations of acetate, formate and oxalate were in the range of 2.0-8.2 mu M at all depths. Methanotrophic and methanogenic communities were quantified using pmoA and mcrA, respectively, as marker genes. The abundances of both communities showed a distinct peak at a depth of 10-15 cm below the vegetation surface.

AB Peatlands may play an important role in global carbon cycles, and thus developing better estimates of carbon exchange in those ecosystems has become a main concern. In this study, the relationship between spectral indices and CO2 fluxes was tested for different communities in a Sphagnum-dominated peatland. Fluxes were measured with a portable climate-controlled chamber while reflectance was simultaneously recorded using a hand-held spectroradiometer. A laboratory experiment was also conducted to select the water-related index most correlated with Sphagnum water content to regulate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values obtained in the field. The laboratory experiment showed a strong correlation between Sphagnum water content and all spectral indices, namely the water index (WI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and relative depth index (RDI) (r = 0.753-0.993). WI was the index selected for regulating NDVI values. Indices tested in the field for CO2 flux estimations were (i) NDVI, (ii) NDVI/WI, (iii) NDVI x sPRI (photochemical reflectance index), and (iv) the chlorophyll indices CI and CIm. NDVI alone was a poor predictor of net ecosystem exchange (NEE, r(2) = 0.12) and gross photosynthesis (P-G, r(2) = 0.15), and NDVI x sPRI and NDVI/WI showed moderate adjustments to CO2 fluxes (NEE, r(2) = 0.26 and 0.30; P-G, r(2) = 0.38 and 0.43, respectively, for each index). The relationship between CO2 fluxes and chlorophyll indices was reasonably well adjusted (CI and NEE, r(2) = 0.37; CI and P-G, r(2) = 0.55; CIm and NEE, r(2) = 0.38; CIm and P-G, r(2) = 0.57), and these indices may be the most promising for mapping the spatial distribution of CO2 fluxes in the future.

AB The temperature dependence of chemical reaction rates and microbial metabolism mean that temperature is a key factor regulating soil trace gas emissions and hydrochemistry. Here we evaluated a novel approach for studying the thermal response of soils, by examining the effects of temperature on gas emissions and hydrochemistry in (a) peat and (b) soil from a Sitka spruce plantation. A thermal gradient was applied along an aluminium bar, allowing soil to be incubated contemporaneously from 2 to 18 degrees C. The approach demonstrated clear differences in the biogeochemical responses of the two soil types to warming. The peat showed no significant emission of CH4 at temperatures below 6 degrees C, while above 6 degrees C, a marked increase in the rate of release was apparent up to 15 degrees C (Q(10) = 2.5) with emissions being similar between 15 and 18 degrees C. Conversely, CH4 emissions from the forest soil did not respond to warming. Nitrate availability in the peat decreased by 90% between 2 and 18 degrees C (P < 0.01), whereas concentrations in the forest soil did not respond. Sulphate availability in the peat decreased significantly with warming (60%, P < 0.01), while the forest soil showed the opposite response (a 30% increase, P < 0.01). Conventionally, thermal responses are studied by incubating individual soil samples at different temperatures, involving lengthy preparation and facilities to incubate samples at different temperatures simultaneously. Data collected on a given thermal response is usually limited and thus interpolated or extrapolated. The thermal gradient method overcomes these problems, is simple and flexible, and can be adapted for a wide range of sample types (not confined to soil). Such apparatus may prove useful in the optimization of management practices to mitigate the effects of climate change, as thermal responses will differ depending on land use and soil type.

AB Northern peatlands play a crucial role in the global carbon balance, serving as a persistent sink for atmospheric CO2 and a global carbon store. Their most extensive type, Sphagnum-dominated acidic peatlands, is inhabited by microorganisms with poorly understood degradation capabilities. Here, we applied a combination of barcoded pyrosequencing of SSU rRNA genes and Illumina RNA-Seq of total RNA (metatranscriptomics) to identify microbial populations and enzymes involved in degrading the major components of Sphagnum-derived litter and exoskeletons of peat-inhabiting arthropods: cellulose, xylan, pectin and chitin. Biopolymer addition to peat induced a threefold to fivefold increase in bacterial cell numbers. Functional community profiles of assembled mRNA differed between experimental treatments. In particular, pectin and xylan triggered increased transcript abundance of genes involved in energy metabolism and central carbon metabolism, such as glycolysis and TCA cycle. Concurrently, the substrate-induced activity of bacteria on these two biopolymers stimulated grazing of peat-inhabiting protozoa. Alveolata (ciliates) was the most responsive protozoa group as confirmed by analysis of both SSU rRNA genes and SSU rRNA. A stimulation of alphaproteobacterial methanotrophs on pectin was consistently shown by rRNA and mRNA data. Most likely, their significant enrichment was due to the utilization of methanol released during the degradation of pectin. Analysis of SSU rRNA and total mRNA revealed a specific response of Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria to chitin and pectin, respectively. Relatives of Telmatobacter bradus were most responsive among the Acidobacteria, while the actinobacterial response was primarily affiliated with Frankiales and Propionibacteriales. The expression of a wide repertoire of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) corresponded well to the detection of a highly diverse peat-inhabiting microbial community, which is dominated by yet uncultivated bacteria.

AB Drained peat soils are a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere. Rewetting these soils is considered an important climate change mitigation tool to reduce emissions and create suitable conditions for carbon sequestration. Long-term monitoring is essential to capture interannual variations in GHG emissions and associated environmental variables and to reduce the uncertainty linked with GHG emission factor calculations. In this study, we present GHG balances: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) calculated for a 5-year period at a rewetted industrial cutaway peatland in Ireland (rewetted 7years prior to the start of the study); and compare the results with an adjacent drained area (2-year data set), and with ten long-term data sets from intact (i.e. undrained) peatlands in temperate and boreal regions. In the rewetted site, CO2 exchange (or net ecosystem exchange (NEE)) was strongly influenced by ecosystem respiration (R-eco) rather than gross primary production (GPP). CH4 emissions were related to soil temperature and either water table level or plant biomass. N2O emissions were not detected in either drained or rewetted sites. Rewetting reduced CO2 emissions in unvegetated areas by approximately 50%. When upscaled to the ecosystem level, the emission factors (calculated as 5-year mean of annual balances) for the rewetted site were (+/- SD) -104 +/- 80g CO2-C m(-2)yr(-1) (i.e. CO2 sink) and 9 +/- 2g CH4-C m(-2)yr(-1) (i.e. CH4 source). Nearly a decade after rewetting, the GHG balance (100-year global warming potential) had reduced noticeably (i.e. less warming) in comparison with the drained site but was still higher than comparative intact sites. Our results indicate that rewetted sites may be more sensitive to interannual changes in weather conditions than their more resilient intact counterparts and may switch from an annual CO2 sink to a source if triggered by slightly drier conditions.

AB Peatlands play outsized roles in the global carbon cycle. Despite occupying a rather small fraction of the terrestrial biosphere (similar to 3%), these ecosystems account for roughly one third of the global soil carbon pool. This carbon is largely comprised of undecomposed deposits of plant material (peat) that may be meters thick. The fate of this deep carbon stockpile with ongoing and future climate change is thus of great interest and has large potential to induce positive feedback to climate warming. Recent in situ warming of an ombrotrophic peatland indicated that the deep peat microbial communities and decomposition rates were resistant to elevated temperatures. In this experiment, we sought to understand how nutrient and pH limitations may interact with temperature to limit microbial activity and community composition. Anaerobic microcosms of peat collected from 1.5 to 2 meters in depth were incubated at 6 degrees C and 15 degrees C with elevated pH, nitrogen (NH4Cl), and/or phosphorus (KH2PO4) in a full factorial design. The production of CO2 and CH4 was significantly greater in microcosms incubated at 15 degrees C, although the structure of the microbial community did not differ between the two temperatures. Increasing the pH from similar to 3.5 to similar to 5.5 altered microbial community structure, however increases in CH4 production were non-significant. Contrary to expectations, N and P additions did not increase CO2 and CH4 production, indicating that nutrient availability was not a primary constraint in microbial decomposition of deep peat. Our findings indicate that temperature is a key factor limiting the decomposition of deep peat, however other factors such as the availability of O-2 or alternative electron donors and high concentrations of phenolic compounds, may also exert constraints. Continued experimental peat warming studies will be necessary to assess if the deep peat carbon bank is susceptible to increased temperatures over the longer time scales.

AB The end of the Late Palaeozoic Ice Age (LPIA) ushered in a period of significant change in Earth's carbon cycle, demonstrated by the widespread occurrence of coals worldwide. In this study, we present stratigraphically constrained organic stable carbon isotope (delta C-13(org)) data for Early Permian coals (312 vitrain samples) from the Moatize Basin, Mozambique, which record the transition from global icehouse to greenhouse conditions. These coals exhibit a three-stage evolution in atmospheric delta C-13 from the Artinskian to the Kungurian. Early Kungurian coals effectively record the presence of the short-lived Kungurian Carbon Isotopic Excursion (KCIE), associated with the proposed rapid release of methane clathrates during deglaciation at the terminus of the Late Palaeozoic Ice Age (LPIA), with no observed disruption to peat-forming and terrestrial plant communities. delta C-13(org) variations in coals from the Moatize Basin are cyclic in nature on the order of 10(3)-10(5) years and reflect changes in delta C-13(org) of similar to +/- 1% during periods of stable peat accumulation, supporting observations from Palaeozoic coals elsewhere. These cyclic variations express palaeoenvironmental factors constraining peat growth and deposition, associated with changes in base level. This study also demonstrates the effectiveness of vitrain in coal as a geochemical tool for recording global atmospheric change during the Late Palaeozoic.

AB The sloping flanks of peatlands are commonly patterned with non-random, contour-parallel stripes of distinct micro-habitats such as hummocks, lawns and hollows. Patterning seems to be governed by feedbacks among peatland hydrological processes, plant micro-succession, plant litter production and peat decomposition. An improved understanding of peatland patterning may provide important insights into broader aspects of the long-term development of peatlands and their likely response to future climate change.
   We recreated a cellular simulation model from the literature, as well as three subtle variants of the model, to explore the controls on peatland patterning. Our models each consist of three submodels, which simulate: peatland water tables in a gridded landscape, micro-habitat dynamics in response to water-table depths, and changes in peat hydraulic properties.
   We found that the strength and nature of simulated patterning was highly dependent on the degree to which water tables had reached a steady state in response to hydrological inputs. Contrary to previous studies, we found that under a true steady state the models predict largely unpatterned landscapes that cycle rapidly between contrasting dry and wet states, dominated by hummocks and hollows, respectively. Realistic patterning only developed when simulated water tables were still transient.
   Literal interpretation of the degree of hydrological transience required for patterning suggests that the model should be discarded; however, the transient water tables appear to have inadvertently replicated an ecological memory effect that may be important to peatland patterning. Recently buried peat layers may remain hydrologically active despite no longer reflecting current vegetation patterns, thereby highlighting the potential importance of three-dimensional structural complexity in peatlands to understanding the two-dimensional surface-patterning phenomenon.
   The models were highly sensitive to the assumed values of peat hydraulic properties, which we take to indicate that the models are missing an important negative feedback between peat decomposition and changes in peat hydraulic properties. Understanding peatland patterning likely requires the unification of cellular landscape models such as ours with cohort-based models of long-term peatland development.

AB Recent high-latitude warming is increasing the vulnerability of permafrost to thaw, which is amplified by local disturbances such as fire. However, the long-term ecological effects and carbon dynamics are not well understood. Here we present a 2200-year record of pollen, plant macrofossils, testate amoebae, and apparent carbon (C) accumulation rates from two peat cores in a collapse-scar bog (thermokarst) near Fairbanks, Alaska. A black spruce ecosystem with low apparent C accumulation rates existed on the site during the first similar to 1500 years of the record. We identify two thaw events, which are linked to local fires. Permafrost aggraded rapidly following the first thaw, which we attribute to local vegetation feedbacks and a cooler climate. The second thaw event at 525 cal y BP is preceded by a stand-replacing fire, as evidenced by a drastic decline in Picea and an initial increase in Epilobium, Salix, and ericaceous shrubs, followed by a sustained increase in Populus. Locally, the forest does not recover for more than 100 years, and the site has remained permafrost-free for the last 500 years. Following thaw, average apparent C accumulation rates (60 to > 100 g C m(-2) y(-1)) are 5-6 times higher than average boreal C accumulation rates, indicating that peat C accumulation rates can remain substantially elevated for much more than a century following thaw. The low apparent C accumulation for the formerly forested, permafrost peat (< 5 g C m(-2) y(-1)) may suggest that C accumulation increases substantially following thaw, but it remains unknown whether deep peat C loss occurred immediately following thaw. Well-preserved Sphagnum peat dominates during this period of rapid accumulation, except for an interval from similar to 400 to 275 cal y BP which alternates between Sphagnum and vascular plant-dominated peat and wetter, minerotrophic conditions. A decline in Picea pollen during this interval and again similar to 100 cal y BP suggests a decrease in suitable substrate for tree growth likely attributable to thermokarst expansion on the collapse-scar margin. These findings suggest that the combined effects of fire and thermokarst will result in a long-term reduction of spruce ecosystems in interior Alaska.

AB Variation in the organic matter content associated with suspended particulate matter (SPM) is an often overlooked component of carbon cycling within freshwater riverine systems. The potential biogeochemical reactivity of particulate organic carbon (POC) that affect its interactions and fate, i.e. respired and lost to the atmosphere along river continua or ultimately exported to estuarine and oceanic pools was assessed.
   Eleven contrasting sites draining nested catchments (5-1837 km(2)) in the River Dee basin, NE Scotland were sampled during summer 2008 to evaluate spatio-temporal variations in quantity and quality (biogeochemical reactivity) of SPM during relatively low flow conditions. Mean SPM concentrations increased from 0.21 to 1.22 mg L-1 between the uppermost and lowest mainstem sites. Individually, POC concentrations ranged from 0.08 to 0.55 mg L-1 and accounted for ca. 3-15% of total aqueous organic carbon transported. The POC content was partitioned into autotrophic (2.78-73.0 mg C g(-1) SPM) and detrital (119-388 mg C g(-1) SPM) biomass carbon content. The particulate respired CO2-C as a % of the total carbon associated with SPM, measured by MicroResp (TM) over 18 h, varied in recalcitrance from 0.49% at peat-dominated sites to 3.20% at the lowermost mainstem site. Significant (p<0.05) relationships were observed between SPM biogeochemical reactivity measures (% respired CO2-C; chlorophyll alpha; bioavailable-phosphorus) and arable and improved grassland area, associated with increasing biological productivity downstream.
   Compositional characteristics and in-stream processing of SPM appear to be related to contributory land use pressures, that influence SPM characteristics and biogeochemistry (C:N:P stoichiometry) of its surrounding aqueous environment. As moorland influences declined, nutrient inputs from arable and improved grasslands increasingly affected the biogeochemical content and reactivity of both dissolved and particulate matter. This increases the potential for recycling of the organic matter that is either transported from upstream or entering further along the riverine continuum. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The magnitude and acceleration of carbon dioxide emissions from warming Arctic tundra soil is an important part of the Region's influence on the Earth's climate system. We investigated the links between soil carbon stocks, soil organic matter decomposition, vegetation heterogeneity, temperature, and environmental sensitivities in dwarf shrub tundra near Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. We quantified carbon stocks of forty-two soil profiles using bulk density estimates based on previous studies in the region. The soil profiles were located within six vegetation types at nine study sites, distributed across an environmental gradient. We also monitored air and soil temperature and measured in situ soil respiration to quantify variation in carbon flux between vegetation types. For spatial extrapolation, we created a high-resolution land cover classification map of the study area. Aside from a single soil profile taken from a fen soil (54.55 kg C m(-2); 2.13 kg N m(-2)), the highest carbon stocks were found in wet grassland soils (mean, 95% CI: 34.87 kg C m(-2), [27.30, 44.55]). These same grassland soils also had the highest mid-growing-season soil respiration rates. Our estimation of soil carbon stocks and mid-growing-season soil respiration measurements indicate that grassland soils are a "hot spot" for soil carbon storage and soil carbon dioxide efflux. Even though shrub, steppe, and mixed vegetation had lower average soil carbon stocks (14.66 - 20.17 kg C m(-2)), these vegetation types played an important role in carbon cycling at the landscape scale because they cover approximately 50 percent of the terrestrial landscape and store approximately 68 percent of the landscape soil organic carbon. The heterogeneous soil carbon stocks in this landscape may be sensitive to key environmental changes, such as shrub expansion and climate change. These environmental drivers could possibly result in a trend toward decreased soil carbon storage and increased release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

AB A range of observations points towards earlier onset of spring in northern high latitudes. However, despite the profound effects this may have on vegetation-atmosphere exchange of carbon (NEE), vegetation-atmosphere physical coupling, or the location of the tundra-taiga interface, the number of studies that investigate winter-spring transition fluxes in contrasting northern vegetation types is limited. Here, we examine spring ecosystem-atmosphere energy and carbon exchange in a Siberian pine forest and mire. Divergent surface albedo before and during snow-melt resulted in daytime net radiation (R-n) above the forest exceeding R. above the mire by up to 10 MJ m(-2). Until stomata could open, absorbed radiation by the green pine canopy caused substantial daytime sensible heat fluxes (H > 10 MJ m(-2)). H above the mire was very low, even negative (<-2 MJ M-2), during that same period. Physiological activity in both ecosystems responded rapidly to warming temperatures and snow-melt, which is essential for survival in Siberia with its very short summers. On days with above-zero temperatures, before melt. was complete, low rates of forest photosynthesis (1-2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) were discernible. Forest and mire NEE became negative the same day, or shortly after, photosynthesis commenced. The mire lagged by about two weeks behind the forest and regained its full carbon uptake capacity at a slower rate. Our data provide empirical evidence for the importance the timing of spring and the relative proportion of forest vs. mire has for late winter/spring boundary-layer growth, and production and surface-atmosphere mixing of trace gases. Models that seek to investigate effects of increasingly earlier spring in high latitudes must correctly account for contrasting physical and biogeochemical ecosystem-atmosphere exchange in heterogeneous landscapes.

AB Rapid climate change and intensified human activities have resulted in water table lowering (WTL) and enhanced nitrogen (N) deposition in Tibetan alpine wetlands. These changes may alter the magnitude and direction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, affecting the climate impact of these fragile ecosystems. We conducted a mesocosm experiment combined with a metagenomics approach (GeoChip 5.0) to elucidate the effects of WTL (-20cm relative to control) and N deposition (30kg N ha(-1)yr(-1)) on carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes as well as the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that WTL reduced CH4 emissions by 57.4% averaged over three growing seasons compared with no-WTL plots, but had no significant effect on net CO2 uptake or N2O flux. N deposition increased net CO2 uptake by 25.2% in comparison with no-N deposition plots and turned the mesocosms from N2O sinks to N2O sources, but had little influence on CH4 emissions. The interactions between WTL and N deposition were not detected in all GHG emissions. As a result, WTL and N deposition both reduced the global warming potential (GWP) of growing season GHG budgets on a 100-year time horizon, but via different mechanisms. WTL reduced GWP from 337.3 to -480.1g CO2-eq m(-2) mostly because of decreased CH4 emissions, while N deposition reduced GWP from 21.0 to -163.8g CO2-eq m(-2), mainly owing to increased net CO2 uptake. GeoChip analysis revealed that decreased CH4 production potential, rather than increased CH4 oxidation potential, may lead to the reduction in net CH4 emissions, and decreased nitrification potential and increased denitrification potential affected N2O fluxes under WTL conditions. Our study highlights the importance of microbial mechanisms in regulating ecosystem-scale GHG responses to environmental changes.

AB The extensive peatlands and lakes of the Far North of Ontario warrant committed scientific attention given their status as a significant carbon sink. Economic interest in this region has recently increased due to the discovery of vast mineral deposits (mainly chromite and nickel) known as the "Ring of Fire''. Mineral exploration and infrastructure planning are underway, but environmental monitoring is only beginning. Detailed baseline ecological information is required to assess the impacts of future resource extraction within the context of multiple environmental stressors (including recent regional climate warming). Here we use sediment cores from two relatively deep lakes (Z(max) similar to 10 m) and two shallow lakes (Z(max) similar to 2 m), all located in the vicinity of the Ring of Fire, to examine biotic responses to warming prior to the commencement of mining activities. Our data show that, over the past similar to 150 years, diatom and cladoceran sedimentary assemblages have transitioned from dominance by littoral/benthic forms to greater abundances of planktonic cladoceran (an increase of similar to 3 to 34 %) and diatom taxa (an increase of similar to 3 to 22 %). Increased relative abundances of planktonic taxa are consistent with warming-induced changes in lake properties including longer ice-free periods and increased production by planktonic algae. The response of diatom assemblages in shallow lakes to warming preceded the deeper lakes by similar to 45 to 60 years, and substantial increases in aquatic production (similar to 4 to 15 times higher than in sediments deposited prior to 1900) were observed in the shallow lakes, in agreement with previous analyses demonstrating the heightened sensitivity of shallow systems to climate warming. These data provide important information necessary to distinguish potential ecological impacts related to resource extraction from natural variation and the ongoing responses to regional climate warming.

Gross photosynthesis, ecosystem respiration, and net CO2 exchange were measured weekly during May-September 2011 using climate-controlled chambers. A substrate-induced respiration technique was used to determine the functional ability of the microbial community. The highest N and NPK additions were associated with 40% less net CO2 uptake than the control. In the NPK additions, a diminished C sink potential was due to a 20-30% increase in ecosystem respiration, while gross photosynthesis rates did not change as greater vascular plant biomass compensated for the decrease in Sphagnum mosses. In the highest N-only treatment, small reductions in gross photosynthesis and no change in ecosystem respiration led to the reduced C sink. Substrate-induced microbial respiration was significantly higher in all levels of NPK additions compared with control. The temperature sensitivity of respiration in the plots was lower with increasing cumulative N load, suggesting more labile sources of respired CO2. The weaker C sink potential could be explained by changes in nutrient availability, higher woody:foliar ratio, moss loss, and enhanced decomposition. Stronger responses to NPK fertilization than to N-only fertilization for both shrub biomass production and decomposition suggest that the bog ecosystem is N-P/K colimited rather than N-limited. Negative effects of further N-only deposition were indicated by delayed spring CO2 uptake. In contrast to forests, increased wood formation and surface litter accumulation in bogs seem to reduce the C sink potential owing to the loss of peat-forming Sphagnum.

AB Boreal headwater streams have been identified as hot spots for evasion of greenhouse gases (GHGs). This study was the first to systematically determine the concentrations of CO2 and CH4 in hemiboreal headwater streams. The use of a headspace sampling method focusing on GHGs in combination with a statistically representative selection of more than 200 streams across two regions in Sweden was the basis for defining the base flow concentrations of CO2 and CH4. All streams were supersaturated relative to the atmosphere in CO2 and the majority in CH4 for the 82% of streams in which CH4 was detected. The spatial variability in both CO2 and CH4 was high but positively related to total organic carbon, mean annual temperature, and proportion of peatland in the catchment. There were, however, regional differences in the spatial controls, which are something that predictive models need to consider. The data set allowed for comparison between a headspace and an alkalinity-based method for determining CO2. More than 50% of the streams contained no alkalinity which made the alkalinity-based determination of CO2 impossible. In addition, half of the streams with alkalinity had alkalinities low enough (<0.07meqL(-1)) to make the CO2 determination very uncertain. The streams with low pH and no alkalinity contained median CO2 concentrations that were 45% higher than the streams containing alkalinity. Therefore, large-scale generalizations about CO2 in such headwaters will be significantly underestimated if (1) headwaters are underrepresented and (2) the headwaters are sampled but CO2 is calculated from their alkalinity.

AB Carbon dioxide efflux and soil microenvironmental factors were measured diurnally in Carex aquatilus- and Eriophorum angustifolium-dominated riparian tundra communities to determine the relative importance of soil environmental factors controlling ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange with the atmosphere. Measurements were made weekly between 18 June and 24 July 1990. Diurnal patterns in carbon dioxide efflux were best explained by changes in soil temperature, while seasonal changes in efflux were correlated with changes in depth to water table, depth to frozen soil and soil moisture. Carbon dioxide efflux rates were lowest early in the growing season when high water tables and low soil temperatures limited microbial and root activity. Individual rainfall events that raised the water table were found to strongly reduce carbon dioxide efflux. As the growing season progressed, rainfall was low and depth to water table and soil temperatures increased. In response, carbon dioxide efflux increased strongly, attaining rates late in the season of approximately 10 g CO2 m-2 day-1. These rates are as high as maxima recorded for other arctic sites. A mathematical model is developed which demonstrates that soil temperature and depth to water table may be used as efficient predictors of ecosystem CO2 efflux in this habitat. In parallel with the field measurements Of CO2 efflux, microbial respiration was studied in the laboratory as a function of temperature and water content. Estimates of microbial respiration per square meter under field conditions were made by adjusting for potential respiring soil volume as water table changed and using measured soil temperatures. The results indicate that the effect of these factors on microbial respiration may explain a large part of the diurnal and seasonal variation observed in CO2 efflux. As in coastal tundra sites, environmental changes that alter water table depth in riparian tundra communities will have large effects on ecosystem CO2 efflux and carbon balance.

AB Estimating near-surface moisture conditions from the reflectance spectra (400-2500 nm) of Sphagnum moss offers great opportunities for the use of remote sensing as a tool for large-scale detailed monitoring of near-surface peatland hydrological conditions. This article investigates the effects of changes in near-surface and surface moisture upon the spectral characteristics of Sphagnum moss. Laboratory-based canopy reflectance data were collected from two common species of Sphagnum subjected to drying and subsequent rewetting. Several spectral indices developed from the near infra-red (NIR) and shortwave infra-red (SWIR) liquid water absorption bands and two biophysical indices (REIP and the chlorophyll index) were correlated with measures of near-surface moisture. All spectral indices tested were significantly correlated with near-surface moisture (with r between 0.27 and 0.94). The strongest correlations were observed using indices developed from the NIR liquid water absorption features (fWBI(980) and fWBI(1200)). However, a hysteretic response was observed in both NIR indices when the canopies were re-hydrated, a finding which may have implications for the timing of remote sensing image acquisition. The Moisture Stress Index (MSI), developed from the SWIR liquid water absorption feature also showed strong correlations with near-surface wetness although the range of moisture conditions over which the index was able to detect change was highly dependent on Sphagnum species. Of the biophysical spectral indices tested (REIP and the chlorophyll index), the most significant relationships were observed between the chlorophyll index and near-surface wetness. All spectral indices tested were species specific, and this is attributed to differences in canopy morphology between Sphagnum species. The potential for developing estimations of surface and near-surface hydrological conditions across northern peatlands using remote sensing technology is discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Although methane (CH4) fluxes from northern wetlands in Asia have been described in previous research at different temporal and spatial scales, integrated studies at the ecosystem scale were scarce. In this study, CH4 fluxes were measured using eddy covariance (EC) technique and the chamber method in a cool temperate marsh in northeast China during the growing season (May-September) of 2011. CH4 emissions were highly variable, both temporally and spatially during the measurement period. According to the EC observation data, CH4 fluxes showed a significant diurnal cycle during the mid-growing season with nighttime average flux about 67% of the average daytime values. Daily cumulative CH4 fluxes varied from 54 to 250 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) with an average flux of 136.2 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). The observations of chamber method showed that CH4 emissions differed markedly among the three main plant communities. Average flux at the Carex lasiocarpa site was about 4 times and 13.5 times of that at the Glyceria spiculosa site and Deyewcia angustifolia site, respectively. The spatial variability of CH4 flux was mainly controlled by the varying water table level as well as the spatial distribution of different vascular plants, while the seasonal dynamic of CH4 emission could be best explained by the change of surface soil temperature and air pressure. A comparison was made between EC measurements and the upscaled chamber based model. The results from the model overestimated CH4 emission by 28% compared to the EC data. Considering the large variability of methane emission, it is necessary to conduct continuous observations on CH4 emission from northern wetlands at different temporal and spatial scales to comprehend the variability and also to predict responses to climate change.

AB Boreal wetlands play an important role in global carbon balance. However, their ecosystem function is threatened by direct anthropogenic disturbance and climate change. Oil sands surface mining in the boreal regions of Western Canada denudes tracts of land of organic materials, leaves large areas in need of reclamation, and generates considerable quantities of extraction process-affected materials. Knowledge and validation of reclamation techniques that lead to self-sustaining wetlands has lagged behind development of protocols for reclaiming terrestrial systems. It is important to know whether wetlands reclaimed with oil sands process materials can be restored to levels equivalent to their original ecosystem function. We approached this question by assessing carbon flows and food web structure in naturally formed and oil sands-affected wetlands constructed in 1970-2004 in the postmining landscape. We evaluated whether a prescribed reclamation strategy, involving organic matter amendment, accelerated reclaimed wetland development, leading to wetlands that were more similar to their natural marsh counterparts than wetlands that were not supplemented with organic matter. We measured compartment standing stocks for bacterioplankton, microbial biofilm, macrophytes, detritus, and zoobenthos; concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and residual naphthenic acids; and microbial production, gas fluxes, and aquatic-terrestrial exports (i.e., aquatic insect emergence). The total biomass of several biotic compartments differed significantly between oil sands and reference wetlands. Submerged macrophyte biomass, macroinvertebrate trophic diversity, and predator biomass and richness were lower in oil sands-affected wetlands than in reference wetlands. There was insufficient evidence to conclude that wetland age and wetland amendment with peat-mineral mix mitigate effects of oil sands waste materials on the fully aquatic biota. Although high variability was observed within most compartments, our data show that 20-year-old wetlands containing oil sands material have not yet reached the same level of function as their reference counterparts.

AB Simulation models are widely used to assess the impacts of management and environmental variables on soil organic matter dynamics, to address questions on ecosystem sustainability and carbon cycling under global change. We tested the Century ecosystem model for two long-term experiments in north-eastern Italy: one (SF) comparing nutrient management treatments in small confined plots containing widely contrasting soil types (i.e., sandy, clay and peat) and the other (CR) involving a field study with crop rotation, nutrient, and management intensity variables. The organic matter changes in the SF experiment, showed a strong, linear relationship with C inputs from crop residues and added manures in the sand and clay soils, which was closely mimicked by the model. There was a net loss of soil C for all treatments in the peat soil, but the rate and overall magnitude of C losses were accurately simulated by the model, which suggested that treatment effects on soil C inputs was the major determinant of SOC dynamics in all three soils. In the CR experiment the model reasonably simulated the large initial decline (averaging about 30% of initial levels) in SOC observed in all treatments, as well as mean treatment effects over the course of the experiment. The model predicted a general pattern of higher SOC in the high management intensity, high fertility treatment combinations and lower SOC in the low management intensity, low fertility treatments; however, observed soil C did not show a clear pattern related to the treatments. Simulated soil C contents were linearly related to C input levels in the different treatments while there was no significant relationship between measured soil C and C inputs based on observed data.

AB Wetlands and flooded peatlands can sequester large amounts of carbon (C) and have high greenhouse gas mitigation potential. There is growing interest in financing wetland restoration using C markets; however, this requires careful accounting of both CO2 and CH4 exchange at the ecosystem scale. Here we present a new model, the PEPRMT model (Peatland Ecosystem Photosynthesis Respiration and Methane Transport), which consists of a hierarchy of biogeochemical models designed to estimate CO2 and CH4 exchange in restored managed wetlands. Empirical models using temperature and/or photosynthesis to predict respiration and CH4 production were contrasted with a more process-based model that simulated substrate-limited respiration and CH4 production using multiple carbon pools. Models were parameterized by using a model-data fusion approach with multiple years of eddy covariance data collected in a recently restored wetland and a mature restored wetland. A third recently restored wetland site was used for model validation. During model validation, the process-based model explained 70% of the variance in net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and 50% of the variance in CH4 exchange. Not accounting for high respiration following restoration led to empirical models overestimating annual NEE by 33-51%. By employing a model-data fusion approach we provide rigorous estimates of uncertainty in model predictions, accounting for uncertainty in data, model parameters, and model structure. The PEPRMT model is a valuable tool for understanding carbon cycling in restored wetlands and for application in carbon market-funded wetland restoration, thereby advancing opportunity to counteract the vast degradation of wetlands and flooded peatlands.

AB Methane monooxygenase is the key role enzyme used by the ubiquitous group of methanotrophs to assimilate methane as a source of energy and carbon. This enzyme in both of its forms, soluble and particulate, lacks of substrate specificity, allowing methanotrophs to use other hydrocarbons as co-substrates. This ability is of special interest in bioremediation applications such as biodegradation of chlorinated compounds and in methane mitigation. The use of methanotrophic bacteria based technologies has contributed in the development of strategies to reduce methane emissions from "hat spots" such as landfills. The new generation of metagenomics techniques can help to find methanotrophic bacteria with special characteristics to fulfill specific necessities such as high methane affinity for biocovers and biofilter technologies.

AB Global climate change and in particular sea level rise have resulted in water table level rise in the coastal wetland, which may alter the magnitude and direction of carbon flux. However, the degree to which different water table level affects soil CO2 and CH4 emissions remains uncertain in coastal wetland. Here, a soil microcosm experiment with five water table levels (similar to 40, similar to 30, similar to 20, similar to 10, 0 cm) was conducted in the Yellow River Delta, China. The water table level was controlled by manual. The soil CO2 and CH4 emissions of each water table levels were measured during 150-days incubation in 2018. Our results showed that water table level rise decreased soil CO2 emissions, while increased soil CH4 emissions. However, there was no significant difference in soil CO2 and CH4 emissions from similar to 20 to similar to 40 water table levels, respectively. In addition, water table level rise significant alter soil physical and chemical properties in the uppermost soil layer (0-10 cm) in coastal wetland, in particular soil moisture and salinity, which probably jointly affected soil CO2 and CH4 emissions. Furthermore, cumulative soil CH4 emission was positively significantly correlated to soil organic carbon and total carbon, suggesting that carbon component can supply energy and nutrients and benefit for soil CH4 production. Additionally, there was a significant relationship between cumulative soil CO2 emission and dissolved organic carbon, which indicated that CO2 was mainly contributed from dissolved organic carbon. Cumulative soil CO2 emission was significantly correlated with soil microbial biomass carbon, suggesting that microbial activity played an important role in CO2 emissions in coastal wetlands. Our results also indicate that water table level rise caused by sea level rise may contribute to the storage of soil organic carbon and produces a lower global warming potentials of CH4 and CO2 in the further climate change. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate the effect of hydrological, especially water table level on carbon cycles in coastal wetland when evaluating the climateecarbon feedback scenarios.

AB Predicting future changes in ecosystem services is not only highly desirable but is also becoming feasible as several forces (e.g., available big data, developed data assimilation (DA) techniques, and advanced cyber-infrastructure) are converging to transform ecological research into quantitative forecasting. To realize ecological forecasting, we have developed an Ecological Platform for Assimilating Data (EcoPAD, v1.0) into models. EcoPAD (v1.0) is a web-based software system that automates data transfer and processing from sensor networks to ecological forecasting through data management, model simulation, data assimilation, forecasting, and visualization. It facilitates interactive data-model integration from which the model is recursively improved through updated data while data are systematically refined under the guidance of model. EcoPAD (v1.0) relies on data from observations, process-oriented models, DA techniques, and the web-based workflow.
   We applied EcoPAD (v1.0) to the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climatic and Environmental change (SPRUCE) experiment in northern Minnesota. The EcoPAD- SPRUCE realizes fully automated data transfer, feeds meteorological data to drive model simulations, assimilates both manually measured and automated sensor data into the Terrestrial ECOsystem (TECO) model, and recursively forecasts the responses of various biophysical and biogeochemical processes to five temperature and two CO2 treatments in near-real time (weekly). Forecasting with EcoPAD-SPRUCE has revealed that mismatches in forecasting carbon pool dynamics are more related to model (e.g., model structure, parameter, and initial value) than forcing variables, opposite to forecasting flux variables. EcoPAD-SPRUCE quantified acclimations of methane production in response to warming treatments through shifted posterior distributions of the CH4 : CO2 ratio and the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of methane production towards lower values. Different case studies indicated that realistic forecasting of carbon dynamics relies on appropriate model structure, correct parameterization, and accurate external forcing. Moreover, EcoPADSPRUCE stimulated active feedbacks between experimenters and modelers to identify model components to be improved and additional measurements to be taken. It has become an interactive model-experiment (ModEx) system and opens a novel avenue for interactive dialogue between modelers and experimenters. Altogether, EcoPAD (v1.0) acts to integrate multiple sources of information and knowledge to best inform ecological forecasting.

AB Compelling evidence is presented for the process of,lipid sulfurisation in humic coal-forming environments. The production of reduced inorganic sulfides by sulfate-reducing bacteria during a marine transgression, which occurred during early diagenesis, enabled the selective sequestration of functionalised lipids in the polar and asphaltene fractions from the Eocene, marine-influenced Heartbreak Ridge lignite deposit, southeast Western Australia. Nickel boride desulfurisation experiments conducted on these fractions released small but significant quantities of sulfur-bound hydrocarbons. These comprised mostly higher plant triterpanes, C-29 steranes and extended 17beta(H),21beta(H)-hopanes, linked by one sulfur atom at, or close to, functionalised sites in the original natural product precursors. These sulfurised lipids mostly derive from the same carbon sources as the free hydrocarbon lipids, the exception being the sulfurised extended hopanoids, which may be partially derived from a different bacterial source compared to that of the free hopanoids. These results indicate that the selectivity and nature of steroid and hopanoid vulcanisation in coal-forming mires is akin to that observed in other sedimentary environments. However, the diversity of higher plant triterpanes that can be sulfurised in marine transgressed coals is greater than that typically reported in immature terrestrial coals. This preservation mechanism explains the formation of the structurally related biomarkers in more mature sulfur-rich humic coals. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We applied an inverse model to simulate global carbon (C) cycle dynamics during the Holocene period using atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations reconstructed from Antarctic ice cores and prescribed C accumulation rates of Northern Peatlands (NP) as inputs. Previous studies indicated that different sources could contribute to the 20 parts per million by volume (ppmv) atmospheric CO2 increase over the past 8000 years. These sources of C include terrestrial release of 40-200 petagram C (PgC, 1 petagram=10(15) gram), deep oceanic adjustment to a 500 PgC terrestrial biomass buildup early in this interglacial period, and anthropogenic land-use and land-cover changes of unknown magnitudes. Our study shows that the prescribed peatland C accumulation significantly modifies our previous understanding of Holocene C cycle dynamics. If the buildup of the NP is considered, the terrestrial pool becomes the C sink of about 160-280 PgC over the past 8000 years, and the only C source for the terrestrial and atmospheric C increases is presumably from the deep ocean due to calcium carbonate compensation. Future studies need to be conducted to constrain the basal times and growth rates of the NP C accumulation in the Holocene. These research endeavors are challenging because they need a dynamically-coupled peatland simulator to be constrained with the initiation time and reconstructed C reservoir of the NP. Our results also suggest that the huge reservoir of deep ocean C explains the major variability of the glacial-interglacial C cycle dynamics without considering the anthropogenic C perturbation.

AB BACKGROUND: Forest, grass, and peat fires release approximately 2 petagrams of carbon into the atmosphere each year, influencing weather, climate, and air quality.
   OBJECTIVE: We estimated the annual global mortality attributable to landscape fire smoke (LFS).
   METHODS: Daily and annual exposure to particulate matter <= 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) from fire emissions was estimated globally for 1997 through 2006 by combining outputs from a chemical transport model with satellite-based observations of aerosol optical depth. In World Health Organization (WHO) subregions classified as sporadically affected, the daily burden of mortality was estimated using previously published concentration-response coefficients for the association between short-term elevations in PM2.5 from LFS (contrasted with 0 mu g/m(3) from LFS) and all-cause mortality. In subregions classified as chronically affected, the annual burden of mortality was estimated using the American Cancer Society study coefficient for the association between long-term PM2.5 exposure and all-cause mortality. The annual average PM2.5 estimates were contrasted with theoretical minimum (counterfactual) concentrations in each chronically affected subregion. Sensitivity of mortality estimates to different exposure assessments, counterfactual estimates, and concentration-response functions was evaluated. Strong La Nina and El Nino years were compared to assess the influence of interannual climatic variability.
   RESULTS: Our principal estimate for the average mortality attributable to LFS exposure was 339,000 deaths annually. In sensitivity analyses the interquartile range of all tested estimates was 260,000-600,000. The regions most affected were sub-Saharan Africa (157,000) and Southeast Asia (110,000). Estimated annual mortality during La Nina was 262,000, compared with 532,000 during El Nino.
   CONCLUSIONS: Fire emissions are an important contributor to global mortality. Adverse health outcomes associated with LFS could be substantially reduced by curtailing burning of tropical rainforests, which rarely burn naturally. The large estimated influence of El Nino suggests a relationship between climate and the burden of mortality attributable to LFS.

AB The reintroduction of Sphagnum fragments has been found to be a promising method for restoring mire vegetation in a cutaway peatland. Although it is known that moisture controls Sphagnum photosynthesis, information concerning the sensitivity of carbon dynamics on water-level variation is still scarce. In a 4-year field experiment, we studied the carbon dynamics of reintroduced Sphagnum angustifolium material in a restored (rewetted) cutaway peatland. Cutaway peatland restored by Sphagnum reintroduction showed high sensitivity to variation in water level. Water level controlled both photosynthesis and respiration. Gross photosynthesis (P-G) had a unimodal response to water-level variation with optimum level at -12 cm. The range of water level for high P-G (above 60% of the maximum light-saturated P-G) was between 22 and 1 cm below soil surface. Water level had a dual effect on total respiration. When the water level was below soil surface, peat respiration increased rapidly along the lowering water level until the respiration rate started to slow down at approximately -30 cm. Contrary to peat respiration, the response of Sphagnum respiration to water-level variation resembled that of photosynthesis with an optimum at -12 cm. In optimal conditions, Sphagnum reintroduction turned the cutaway site from carbon source to a sink of 23 g C/m(2) per season (mid-May to the end of September). In dry conditions, lowered photosynthesis together with the higher peat respiration led to a net loss of 56 g C/m(2). Although the water level above the optimum amplitude restricted CO2 fixation, a decrease in peat respiration led to a positive CO2 balance of 9 g C/m(2).

AB Northern peatlands are important stores of carbon and reservoirs of biodiversity that are vulnerable to global change. However, the carbon dynamics of individual peatland plant species is poorly understood, despite the potential for rising atmospheric CO2 to affect the vegetation's contribution to overall ecosystem carbon function. Here, we examined the effects of 3 years exposure to elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) on (a) peatland plant community composition and biomass, and (b) plant carbon dynamics and the production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) using a (CO2)-C-13 pulse-chase approach. Results showed that under eCO(2), Sphagnum spp. cover declined by 39% (P < 0.05) and Juncus effusus L. cover increased by 40% (P < 0.001). There was a concurrent increase in above- and belowground plant biomass of 115% (P < 0.01) and 96% (P < 0.01), respectively. Vascular species assimilated and turned over more (CO2)-C-13-derived carbon than Sphagnum spp. (49% greater turnover of assimilated C-13 in J. effusus and F. ovina L. leaf tissues compared with Sphagnum, P < 0.01). Elevated CO2 also produced a 66% rise in DOC concentrations (P < 0.001) and an order of magnitude more 'new' exudate (DOC)-D-13 than control samples (24 h after (CO2)-C-13 pulse-labelling 2.5 +/- 0.5 and 0.2 +/- 0.1% in eCO(2) and control leachate, respectively, P < 0.05). We attribute the observed increase in DOC concentrations under eCO(2) to the switch from predominantly Sphagnum spp. to vascular species (namely J. effusus), leading to enhanced exudation and decomposition (litter and peat). The potential for reduced peatland carbon accretion, increased DOC exports and positive feedback to climate change are discussed.

AB Recent evidence indicates that our current soil C stores may be already changing from carbon sinks to sources, with reported increasing C losses in both gaseous (soil respiration) and aqueous (dissolved organic carbon, DOC forms) across large areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Current debates have mainly focused on climatic variables; however, accounting for the abiotic and biotic interactions is required to enable better quantifications of C dynamics. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the interactive effects of temperature, moisture and dominant mesofauna (enchytraeids) changes on C losses by incubating root-free sieved soil samples from a peatland soil during 13 weeks at two temperature (14 and 19 C) and two moisture (85 and 60% WHC) treatments under laboratory conditions. Our results showed that neither temperature nor moisture and invertebrates had a significant effect on respiration rates. In contrast, under favourable moisture conditions, the temperature induced changes in enchytraeid population numbers resulted in more DOC being released from these soils, possibly linked to the positive effects of animal activities on iron mobilisation and buffering the pH of the soil solution. Our results also confirmed that moisture contents of 60% WHC could severely affect their population numbers in these organic soils and hence, the functioning of these vulnerable ecosystems. Importantly, in agreement with previous studies, availability of easily accessible C sources seems to be a critical factor in the progressive declines of soil respiration and DOC production rates over time. Taken these findings together it is possible to conclude that the combined action of abiotic factors and their influence on soil fauna populations plays a key role in controlling SOM decomposition rates of these peatland soils.

AB Electrical resistivity/induced polarization (0.1-1000 Hz) and vertical hydraulic conductivity (K-nu) measurements of peat samples extracted from different depths (0-11 m) in a peatland in Maine were obtained as a function of pore fluid conductivity (sigma(w)) between 0.001 and 2 S/m. Hydraulic conductivity increased with sigma(w) (K-nu proportional to sigma(w)(0.3) between 0.001 and 2 S/m), indicating that pore dilation occurs due to the reaction of NaCl with organic functional groups as postulated by previous workers. Electrical measurements were modeled by assuming that "bulk'' electrolytic conduction through the interconnected pore space and surface conduction in the electrical double layer (EDL) at the organic sediment-fluid interface act in parallel. This analysis suggests that pore space dilation causes a nonlinear relationship between the "bulk'' electrolytic conductivity (sigma(el)) and sigma(w) (sigma(el) proportional to sigma(w)(1.3)). The Archie equation predicts a linear dependence of sigma(el) on sigma(w) and thus appears inappropriate for organic sediments. Induced polarization (IP) measurements of the imaginary part (sigma"(surf)) of the surface conductivity (sigma*(surf)) show that sigma"(surf) is greater and more strongly sigma(w)-dependent (sigma"(surf) proportional to sigma(w)(0.5) between 0.001 and 2 S/m) than observed for inorganic sediments. By assuming a linear relationship between the real (sigma'(surf)) and the imaginary part (sigma"(surf)) of the surface conductivity, we develop an empirical model relating the resistivity and induced polarization measurements to sigma(w) in peat. We demonstrate the use of this model to predict (a) sigma(w) and (b) the change in K-nu due to an incremental change in sigma(w) from resistivity and induced polarization measurements on organic sediments. Our study has implications for noninvasive geophysical characterization of sigma(w) and K-nu with potential to benefit studies of carbon cycling and greenhouse gas fluxes as well as nutrient supply dynamics in peatlands.

AB Unravelling the role of structural and environmental drivers of gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R (eco)) in highly heterogeneous tundra is a major challenge for the upscaling of chamber-based CO2 fluxes in Arctic landscapes. In a mountain birch woodland-mire ecotone, we investigated the role of LAI (and NDVI), environmental factors (microclimate, soil moisture), and microsite type across tundra shrub plots (wet hummocks, dry hummocks, dry hollows) and lichen hummocks, in controlling net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). During a growing season, we measured NEE fluxes continuously, with closed dynamic chambers, and performed multiple fits (one for each 3-day period) of a simple light and temperature response model to hourly NEE data. Tundra shrub plots were largely CO2 sinks, as opposed to lichen plots, although fluxes were highly variable within microsite type. For tundra shrub plots, microsite type did not influence photosynthetic parameters but it affected basal (that is, temperature-normalized) ecosystem respiration (R (0)). PAR-normalized photosynthesis (P (600)) increased with air temperature and declined with increasing vapor pressure deficit. R (0) declined with soil moisture and showed an apparent increase with temperature, which may underlie a tight link between GPP and R (eco). NDVI was a good proxy for LAI, maximum P (600) and maximum R (0) of shrub plots. Cumulative CO2 fluxes were strongly correlated with LAI (NDVI) but we observed a comparatively low GPP/LAI in dry hummocks. Our results broadly agree with the reported functional convergence across tundra vegetation, but here we show that the role of decreased productivity in transition zones and the influence of temperature and water balance on seasonal CO2 fluxes in sub-Arctic forest-mire ecotones cannot be overlooked.

AB Peatlands are crucial sinks for carbon in the terrestrial ecosystem, but they are jeopardized by their use as fuel or as growing media. Much research has been performed aiming to find high quality and low cost substrates from different organic wastes, such as coir, compost, sewage or paper sludges, and thus decrease peat consumption. The main objective of this work is to study the effect on peat and coir-based growing media of deinking sludge (R) and biochar obtained by pyrolysis of deinking sludge at 300 degrees C (B300). For this reason, mixtures of peat or coir with deinking sludge and corresponding biochar were prepared mixing them at 50/50 v/v ratios. The results showed that it is possible to improve the chemical and hydrophysical properties of peat and coir with addition of biochar and deinking sludge. Indeed, biochar increased air space, water holding capacity and total porosity of peat-based growing media whereas for coir, the best hydrophysical properties were obtained after deinking sludge addition. Finally, the use of biochar plus peat as growing media can increase lettuce yield by more than 100% with respect to peat growing media, which can be related with the improvement of hydrophysical growing media properties. This yield increment along with the reduction of the over-exploitation of peat can justify the use of biochar as growing media in spite of the cost associated to the pyrolysis process.

AB During the past similar to 50 years, the number and area of lakes have declined in several regions in boreal forests. However, there has been substantial finer-scale heterogeneity; some lakes decreased in area, some showed no trend, and others increased. The objective of this study was to identify the primary mechanisms underlying heterogeneous trends in closed-basin lake area. Eight lake characteristics (delta O-18, electrical conductivity, surface : volume index, bank slope, floating mat width, peat depth, thaw depth at shoreline, and thaw depth at the forest boundary) were compared for 15 lake pairs in Alaskan boreal forest where one lake had decreased in area since similar to 1950, and the other had not. Mean differences in characteristics between paired lakes were used to identify the most likely of nine mechanistic scenarios that combined three potential mechanisms for decreasing lake area (talik drainage, surface water evaporation, and terrestrialization) with three potential mechanisms for nondecreasing lake area (subpermafrost groundwater recharge through an open talik, stable permafrost, and thermokarst). A priori expectations of the direction of mean differences between decreasing and nondecreasing paired lakes were generated for each scenario. Decreasing lakes had significantly greater electrical conductivity, greater surface : volume indices, shallower bank slopes, wider floating mats, greater peat depths, and shallower thaw depths at the forest boundary. These results indicated that the most likely scenario was terrestrialization as the mechanism for lake area reduction combined with thermokarst as the mechanism for nondecreasing lake area. Terrestrialization and thermokarst may have been enhanced by recent warming which has both accelerated permafrost thawing and lengthened the growing season, thereby increasing plant growth, floatingmat encroachment, transpiration rates, and the accumulation of organic matter in lake basins. The transition to peatlands associated with terrestrialization may provide a transient increase in carbon storage enhancing the role of northern ecosystems as major stores of global carbon.

AB Members of the Acidobacteria are among the most efficient colonizers of acidic terrestrial habitats but the key traits underlying their environmental fitness remain to be understood. We analyzed indigenous assemblages of Acidobacteria in a lichen-covered acidic (pH 4.1) soil of forested tundra dominated by uncultivated members of subdivision 1. An isolate of these bacteria with cells occurring within saccular chambers, strain SBC82(T) , was obtained. The genome of strain SBC82(T) consists of a 7.11-Mb chromosome and four megaplasmids, and encodes a wide repertoire of enzymes involved in degradation of chitin, cellulose, and xylan. Among those, four secreted chitinases affiliated with the glycoside hydrolase family GH18 were identified. Strain SBC82(T) utilized amorphous chitin as a source of carbon and nitrogen; the respective enzyme activities were detected in tests with synthetic substrates. Chitinolytic capability was also confirmed for another phylogenetically related acidobacterium isolated from a Sphagnum peat bog, strain CCO287. As revealed by metatranscriptomic analysis of chitin-amended peat, 16S rRNA reads from these acidobacteria increased in response to chitin availability. Strains SBC82(T) and CCO287 were assigned to a novel genus and species, Acidisarcina polymorpha gen. nov., sp. nov. Members of this genus colonize acidic soils and peatlands and specialize in degrading complex polysaccharides.

AB This paper compares two flow routing algorithms' influences on ecohydrological estimations in a northern peatland catchment, within the framework of an arctic-enabled version of the dynamic ecosystem model LPJ-GUESS. Accurate hydrological estimations are needed to fully capture vegetation dynamics and carbon fluxes in the subarctic peatland enviroment. A previously proposed distributed hydrological method based on the single flow (SF) algorithm extracted topographic indices has shown to improve runoff estimations in LPJ-GUESS. This paper investigates model performance differences caused by two flow routing algorithms, and importantly both permafrost processes and peatland hydrology are included in the model. The newly developed triangular form-based multiple flow (TFM) is selected due to its improved consideration of flow continuity and more realistic flow estimation over flat surfaces. A variety of measured data is included to assess both hydrological and ecological accuracy, and the results demonstrate that the choice of flow algorithm does matter for mesoscale ecohydrology applications. The allowance of flow convergence and consideration of flow partition differences from different terrain forms in the TFM algorithm yield better correspondence with the observed hydrological processes and also carbon fluxes. By directing flow to only one downslope cell together with its poorer depiction of flow over flat areas, the SF algorithm can result in too high runoff estimations for low-flat regions and overestimate carbon uptake and release in the peatland. The results of this study also highlight the need for care when selecting flow routing algorithms for biogeochemical estimations, especially within hydrologically and climatically sensitive environments.

AB We measured seasonal patterns of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 in a diverse peatland complex underlain by discontinuous permafrost in northern Manitoba, Canada, as part of the Boreal Ecosystems Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). Study sites spanned the full range of peatland trophic and moisture gradients found in boreal environments from bog (pH 3.9) to rich fen (pH 7.2). During midseason (July-August, 1996), highest fates of NEE and respiration followed the trophic sequence of bog (5.4 to -3.9 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) < poor fen (6.3 to -6.5 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) < intermediate fen (10.5 to -7.8 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) < rich fen (14.9 to -8.7 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). The sequence changed during spring (May-June) and fall (September-October) when ericaceous shrub (e.g., Chamaedaphne calyculata) bogs and sedge (Carex spp.) communities in poor to intermediate fens had higher maximum CO2 fixation rates than deciduous shrub-dominated (Salix spp. and Betula spp.) rich fens. Timing of snowmelt and differential rates of peat surface thaw in microtopographic hummocks and hollows controlled the onset of carbon uptake in spring. Maximum photosynthesis and respiration were closely correlated throughout the growing season with a ratio of approximately 1/3 ecosystem respiration to maximum carbon uptake at all sites across the trophic gradient. Soil temperatures above the water table and timing of surface thaw and Freeze-up in the spring and fall were more important to net CO2 exchange than deep soil warming. This close coupling of maximum CO2 uptake and respiration to easily measurable variables, such as trophic status, peat temperature, and water table, will improve models of wetland carbon exchange. Although trophic status, aboveground net primary productivity, and surface temperatures were more important than water level in predicting respiration on a daily basis, the mean position of the water table was a good predictor (r(2) = 0.63) of mean respiration rates across the range of plant community and moisture gradients. Q(10) values ranged from 3.0 to 4.1 from bog to rich fen, but when normalized by above ground vascular plant biomass, the Q(10) for all sites was 3.3.

AB Questions Peatland ecosystems are a globally important carbon storage that is predicted to turn into a carbon source due to water level drawdown (WLD) associated with climate change. The predictions assume stable plant communities but how realistic is this assumption? If the vegetation is not stable, what are the nature and rate of changes? Location Peatland complex in Southern Finland. Methods We conducted a water level drawdown (WLD of 10 cm) experiment over 17 years in three peatland types differing in their fertility. On each peatland type, we included an adjacent forestry drained (FD, with water table ca. 40 cm lower than in control) area for comparison. Results Peatland type had a clear impact on the response to WLD: at the ecosystem level, the two minerotrophic fens underwent rapid species turnover, while the vegetation in nutrient-poor bog was more resilient to change. In nutrient-rich sites, WLD initiated tree canopy development and created understorey conditions that strengthened impact of WLD. In nutrient-poor site, tree establishment was seen only in the FD area. In addition to high nutrient level, high wetness accelerated change at the plant community level, where we found three types of responses: accelerating change, decelerating change, and stability. Succession resulted in an overall loss of community heterogeneity. Conclusions Interaction between hydrology, nutrient availability, and biological factors in boreal peatlands is important: the drop in water table required to achieve the shift from open peatland to forested system is inversely proportional to the nutrient level of the system. The results suggest that predictive models of peatland functions under climate change should consider compositional change for fens and their diverse plant communities but are more realistic for bogs. The response of bog vegetation to climate change may, however, be more dependent on changes in rainfall regime and therefore needs to be further addressed.

AB Wetlands serve as sinks for carbon and nutrients but they are also a large source of greenhouse gases. Our objective was to quantify emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from three free water surface-flow constructed wetlands in the presence and absence of emergent herbaceous vegetation (Typha angustifolia L. and Typha latifolia L.) across a gradient of soil moisture. Measurements were collected on eight sampling dates during June and July, 2014. Similar to previous research, CO2 emissions were higher in vegetated plots, increasing from a median +/- A std. error of 242 +/- A 29 to 1612 +/- A 95 mg m(-2) h(-1). Emissions of CH4 were also significantly higher in vegetated plots, but the relative magnitude of the effect of plants varied among wetlands. Emissions of CH4 were highest from vegetated plots in the wetland with the highest soil moisture (4.4 +/- A 1.0 mg m(-2) h(-1)). However, the largest effect of plants on methane emissions occurred in the wetland with intermediate soil moisture, with a 15-fold increase in CH4 emissions from 0.15 +/- A 0.90 to 2.4 +/- A 1.2 mg m(-2) h(-1). Design and management that consider the interactive effects of soil moisture and plants on CH4 emissions may help reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of constructed wetlands.

AB Although it has been recognized that rising temperatures and shifts in the hydrological cycle affect the depth of the seasonally thawing upper permafrost stratum, it remains unclear to what extent the frequency and intensity of wildfires, and subsequent changes in vegetation cover, influence the soil active layer on different spatiotemporal scales. Here, we use ring width measurements of the subterranean stem part of 15 larch trees from a Sphagnum bog site in Central Siberia to reconstruct long-term changes in the thickness of the active layer since the last wildfire occurred in 1899. Our approach reveals a three-step feedback loop between above- and belowground ecosystem components. After all vegetation is burned, direct atmospheric heat penetration over the first similar to 20 years caused thawing of the upper permafrost stratum. The slow recovery of the insulating ground vegetation reverses the process and initiates a gradual decrease of the active layer thickness. Due to the continuous spreading and thickening of the peat layer during the last decades, the upper permafrost horizon has increased by 0.52 cm/year. This study demonstrates the strength of annually resolved and absolutely dated tree-ring series to reconstruct the effects of historical wildfires on the functioning and productivity of boreal forest ecosystems at multi-decadal to centennial time-scale. In so doing, we show how complex interactions of above- and belowground components translate into successive changes in the active permafrost stratum. Our results are particularly relevant for improving long-term estimates of the global carbon cycle that strongly depends on the source and sink behavior of the boreal forest zone.

AB Northern peatlands are important carbon (C) sinks and while the patterns of C accumulation have been frequently investigated, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) accumulation are often neglected. Here we link the C: N: P stoichiometry from foliar plant tissues, through senescent litters to peat, and determine C, N and P accumulation rates at Mer Bleue Bog, eastern Canada. Average C: N: P ratios changed from 794: 17: 1 in the foliar tissues to 911: 10: 1 in litter and 1285: 32: 1 in acrotelm peat. The increase in C: N and C: P ratios from mature to senescent tissues is related to nutrient resorption. The increase in C: P and N: P ratios in peat, which was contrary to that observed in Canadian forest soils, may be related to plant/mycorrhizae uptake of P. The long-term apparent rates of C, N and P accumulation were 29.5 +/- 2.1 (SE) g C, 0.87 +/- 0.01 g N and 0.017 +/- 0.002 g P m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. The significant correlation between the accumulation rates of N and P and that of C suggests more attention be placed on C: N: P stoichiometry in peatland biogeochemistry, in particular in understanding why C: P ratios are so large in the lower parts of the profile.

AB Pyrogenic carbon (PyC) derives from incomplete combustion of organic matter and is ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic systems. Most PyC is inherently more stable against decomposition than plant residues, and PyC therefore forms an important component of the global carbon (C) cycle. During the Holocene, about 436Pg organic C accumulated in northern peatlands, and we hypothesize that PyC may contribute substantially to that C stock. We studied 70 samples from 19 intact and degraded European peatland sites and analyzed their PyC content by C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular modeling and peat age and accumulation by radiocarbon dating. Classification of a peatland as either intact or degraded was based on the comparison between apparent and expected long-term C accumulation rates. On average, PyC amounted for 135% of soil C across sites, and accounted for up to 50% at single sites. The amount of PyC increased significantly with peat age. Degraded peatlands had lost approximately 56kgCm(-2), half of their former C stock. However, degraded peat had higher PyC contents than intact one. Selective enrichment of PyC during both peat build-up and decomposition seems to be an important factor fostering PyC accumulation. Assignment of our results to peatlands of the northern hemisphere, stratified by age, revealed an estimated PyC stock of 62 (+/- 22)Pg. Our estimate indicates a substantial and hitherto unquantified contribution of northern peatlands to global PyC storage. (c) 2017 The Authors.

AB Northern peatland water table position is tightly coupled to carbon (C) cycling dynamics and is predicted to change from shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns associated with global climate change. However, it is uncertain how long-term water table alterations will alter C dynamics in northern peatlands because most studies have focused on short-term water table manipulations. The goal of our study was to quantify the effect of long-term water table changes (similar to 80 years) on gaseous C fluxes in a peatland in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Chamber methods were utilized to measure ecosystem respiration (ER), gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and methane (CH4) fluxes in a peatland experiencing levee induced long-term water table drawdown and impoundment in relation to an unaltered site. Inundation raised water table levels by approximately similar to 10 cm and resulted in a decrease in ER and GPP, but an increase of CH4 emissions. Conversely, the drained sites, with water table levels similar to 15 cm lower, resulted in a significant increase in ER and GPP, but a decrease in CH4 emissions. However, NEE was not significantly different between the water table treatments. In summary, our data indicates that long-term water table drawdown and inundation was still altering peatland gaseous C fluxes, even after 80 years. In addition, many of the patterns we found were of similar magnitude to those measured in short-term studies, which indicates that short-term studies might be useful for predicting the direction and magnitude of future C changes in peatlands.

AB The spatial variability of soil properties plays an important role in water and carbon cycles in peatlands. The objectives of this study were to analyze the spatial variation of hydro-physical properties of peat soils and to establish pedotransfer functions (PTFs) to estimate the hydraulic properties of peat using readily available soil properties. We selected three study sites, each representing a different state of peat degradation (natural, degraded and extremely degraded). At each site, 72 undisturbed soil cores were collected from 5 m by 5 m grid cells in an area of 35 m by 40 m. The saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), soil water retention curves, total porosity, macroporosity (pore diameter >30 mu m), bulk density and soil organic matter content (SOM) were determined for all sampling locations. The Van Genuchten (VG) model parameters (theta(s), alpha, and n) were optimized using the RETC software package. A strong positive correlation between macroporosity and Ks was observed irrespective of the degradation stage of the peat. However, the relationships between macroporosity and Ks differed between the natural and the drained peatlands. Adding macroporosity to the PTFs substantially improves the prediction of K-s as well as VG parameters. Results show that the soil physical and hydraulic properties (e.g. K-s and VG model parameters) exhibit different levels of spatial heterogeneity depending on the peat degradation stage. The geostatistical analysis suggests that the spatial dependence of soil hydro-physical properties varies depending on the considered property as well as land management (e.g. drainage). Bulk density and SOM are spatially dependent, whereas K-s and macroporosity are spatially independent if the peat is severely degraded. In conclusion, the peat degradation stage plays an important role and should be generally considered in the spatial analysis of peatlands. The obtained semivariograms may serve as a basis for 2D and 3D hydrological modelling as well as peatland restoration studies.

AB The Kyoto Protocol accepts terrestrial sinks for greenhouse gases (GHGs) as offsets for fossil fuel emissions. Only carbon sequestered in Living biomass from re- and afforestation is presently considered, but the Protocol contains a provision for the possible future inclusion of other land uses and soils. As a result, the possibility of sequestration of carbon in wetlands, and particularly peatlands, is being discussed. Natural peatlands are presently a relatively small sink for CO2 and a large source of CH4: globally, they store between 400 and 500 Gt C. There are large variations among peatlands, but when the "global warming potential" of CH4 is factored in, many peatlands are neither sinks nor sources of GHGs. Some land-use changes may result in peatlands acting as net sinks far GHGs by reducing CH4 emissions and/or increasing CO2 sequestration (e.g., forest drainage), while other land uses may result in large losses of CO2, CH4, and N2O (e.g., agriculture on organic soils, flooding for hydroelectric generation). Other land uses, such as peatland creation and restoration, produce no net change if they are replacing or restoring a previous level of GHG exchange. These are analogous to reforestation of deforested areas. On closer examination, the inclusion of peatlands in a national greenhouse gas strategy as sinks, despite their large role in the terrestrial carbon cycle, may not significantly reduce net greenhouse gas emissons. If the sinks are to be considered, it is reasonable that terrestrial sources associated with all land uses on peatlands also should be considered. If peatlands are not considered explicitly, but soils in forest and agriculture systems are included in the Kyoto Protocol in the future, then those peatlands impacted by these land uses will be incorporated implicitly.

AB Variations of the Earth's atmospheric oxygen concentration (pO(2)) are thought to be closely tied to the evolution of life, with strong feedbacks between uni- and multicellular life and oxygen(1,2). On the geologic timescale, pO(2) is regulated by the burial of organic carbon and sulphur, as well as by weathering(3). Reconstructions of atmospheric O-2 for the past 400 million years have therefore been based on geochemical models of carbon and sulphur cycling(4-6). However, these reconstructions vary widely(4-10), particularly for the Mesozoic and early Cenozoic eras. Here we show that the abundance of charcoal in mire settings is controlled by pO(2), and use this proxy to reconstruct the concentration of atmospheric oxygen for the past 400 million years. We estimate that pO(2) was continuously above 26% during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, and that it declined abruptly around the time of the Permian-Triassic mass extinction. During the Triassic and Jurassic periods, pO(2) fluctuated cyclically, with amplitudes up to 10% and a frequency of 20-30 million years. Atmospheric oxygen concentrations have declined steadily from the middle of the Cretaceous period to present-day values of about 21%. We conclude, however, that variation in pO(2) was not the main driver of the loss of faunal diversity during the Permo-Triassic and Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction events.

AB The impact of intensified drought and rewetting on C cycling in peatlands is debated. We conducted drying/rewetting (DW) experiments with intact monoliths of a temperate fen over a period of 10 months. One treatment with original vegetation (DW-V) and one defoliated treatment (DW-D) were rewetted after an experimental drought of 50 days; another treatment was kept permanently wet (W-V). Soil water content was determined by the TDR technique, C fluxes from chamber measurements and gas profiles in the soils, and respiration from mass balancing CO(2) and CH(4) fluxes in the peat using hourly to weekly data. Zones of high root associated respiration were determined from a (13)C labeling experiment. Autotrophic respiration contributed from 55 to 65% to an average ecosystem respiration (ER) of 92 (DW-D), 211 (DW-V), and 267 mmol m(-2) d(-1) (W-V). Photosynthesis ranged from 0 (DW-D) to 450 mmol m(-2) d(-1) (W-V), and strongly declined for about 30 days after rewetting (DW-V), while ER remained constant during the drying and rewetting event. Drying raised air-filled porosity in the soil to 2-13%, temporarily increased respiration to estimated anaerobic and aerobic rates of up to 550 and 1000 nmol cm(-3) d(-1), and delayed methane production and emission by weeks to months. Root associated respiration was concentrated in the uppermost peat layer. In spite of clear relative changes in respiration during and after drought, the impact on carbon exchange with the atmosphere was small. We attribute this finding to the importance of respiration in the uppermost and soil layer, which remained moist and aerated, and the insensitivity of autotrophic respiration to drought. We expect a similar dynamics to occur in other temperate wetland soils in which soil respiration is concentrated near the peatland surface, such as rich minerotrophic fens. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Peatlands are an important terrestrial carbon store, but disturbance has resulted in the degradation of many peatland ecosystems and caused them to act as a net carbon source. Restoration work is being undertaken but monitoring the success of these schemes can be difficult and costly using traditional field-based methods. A landscape-scale alternative is to use satellite data to assess the condition of peatlands and to estimate gaseous carbon fluxes. In this study we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products to model Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) over peatland sites at various stages of restoration. We found that the MOD17A2H GPP product overestimates GPP modelled from data collected by eddy covariance towers situated at two ex-forestry sites undergoing restoration towards blanket bog at the Forsinard Flows RSPB reserve, Scotland, UK (one full year of data), and a near-natural Atlantic blanket bog site in Glencar, Ireland (ten-year data series). We calibrated a Temperature and Greenness (TG) model for the Forsinard sites and found it to be more accurate than the MODIS GPP product at local scale. We also found that inclusion of a wetness factor using the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) improved inter-annual accuracy of the model. This TGWa (annual Temperature, Greenness and Wetness) model was then applied to six control sites comprising near-natural bog across the reserve, and to six sites on which restoration began between 1998 and 2006. GPP from 2005 to 2016 was estimated for each site using the model. The resulting modelled trends are positive at all six restored sites, increasing by approximately 5.5 g C/m(2)/yr every year since restoration began in the Forsinard Flows reserve. The results suggest that peatland sites undergoing restoration at Forsinard Flows reach the carbon assimilation potential of near-natural bog sites between 5 and 10 years after restoration was begun.

AB Drained thermokarst lake basins accumulate significant amounts of soil organic carbon in the form of peat, which is of interest to understanding carbon cycling and climate change feedbacks associated with thermokarst in the Arctic. Remote sensing is a tool useful for understanding temporal and spatial dynamics of drained basins. In this study, we tested the application of high-resolution X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data of the German TerraSAR-X satellite from the 2009 growing season (July-September) for characterizing drained thermokarst lake basins of various age in the ice-rich permafrost region of the northern Seward Peninsula, Alaska. To enhance interpretation of patterns identified in X-band SAR for these basins, we also analyzed the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from a Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper image acquired on July 2009 and compared both X-band SAR and NDVI data with observations of basin age. We found significant logarithmic relationships between (a) TerraSAR-X backscatter and basin age from 0 to 10,000 years, (b) Landat-5 TM NDVI and basin age from 0 to 10,000 years, and (c) TerraSAR-X backscatter and basin age from 50 to 10,000 years. NDVI was a better indicator of basin age over a period of 0-10,000 years. However, TerraSAR-X data performed much better for discriminating radiocarbon-dated basins (50-10,000 years old). No clear relationships were found for either backscatter or NDVI and basin age from 0 to 50 years. We attribute the decreasing trend of backscatter and NDVI with increasing basin age to post-drainage changes in the basin surface. Such changes include succession in vegetation, soils, hydrology, and renewed permafrost aggradation, ground ice accumulation and localized frost heave. Results of this study show the potential application of X-band SAR data in combination with NDVI data to map long-term succession dynamics of drained thermokarst lake basins.

AB Hydrological disturbances could increase dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports through changes in runoff and leaching, which reduces the potential carbon sink function of peatlands. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of hydrological restoration on hydrological processes and DOC dynamics in a rehabilitated Sphagnum-dominated peatland. A conceptual hydrological model calibrated on the water table and coupled with a biogeochemical module was applied to La Guette peatland (France), which experienced a rewetting initiative on February 2014. The model (eight calibrated parameters) reproduced water-table (0 : 1 < NS < 0 : 61) and pore-water DOC concentrations (2 < RMSE < 11 mg L-1) in a time series (1 April 2014 to 15 December 2017) in two contrasting locations (rewetted and control) in the peatland. Hydrological restoration was found to impact the water balance through a decrease in slow deep drainage and an increase in fast superficial runoff. Observed DOC concentrations were higher in summer in the rewetted location compared to the control area and were linked to a difference in dissolved organic matter composition analyzed by fluorescence. Hydrological conditions, especially the severity of the water-table drawdown in summer, were identified as the major factor controlling DOC-concentration dynamics. The results of the simulation suggest that the hydrological restoration did not affect DOC loads, at least in a short-term period (3 years). However, it impacted the temporal dynamics of DOC exports, which were the most episodic and were mainly transported through fast surface runoff in the area affected by the restoration, while slow deep drainage dominated DOC exports in the control area. In relation to dominant hydrological processes, exported DOC is expected to be derived from more recent organic matter in the top peat layer in the rewetted area, compared to the control area. Since it is calibrated on water-table and DOC concentration, the model presented in this study proved to be a relevant tool in identifying the main hydrological processes and factors controlling DOC dynamics in different areas of the same peatland. It is also a suitable alternative to a discharge-calibrated catchment model when the outlet is not easy to identify or to monitor.

AB Natural peatlands accumulate carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). They affect the global climate by binding carbon dioxide (CO2) and releasing methane (CH4) to the atmosphere; in contrast fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) in natural peatlands are insignificant. Changes in drainage associated with forestry alter these greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and thus the radiative forcing (RF) of peatlands. In this paper, changes in peat and tree stand C stores, GHG fluxes and the consequent RF of Finnish undisturbed and forestry-drained peatlands are estimated for 1900-2100. The C store in peat is estimated at 5.5 Pg in 1950. The rate of C sequestration into peat has increased from 2.2 Tg a(-1) in 1900, when all peatlands were undrained, to 3.6 Tg a(--1) at present, when c . 60% of peatlands have been drained for forestry. The C store in tree stands has increased from 60 to 170 Tg during the 20th century. Methane emissions have decreased from an estimated 1.0-0.5 Tg CH4-C a(-1) , while those of N2O have increased from 0.0003 to 0.005 Tg N-2 O-N a(-1). The altered exchange rates of GHG gases since 1900 have decreased the RF of peatlands in Finland by about 3 mW m(--2) from the predrainage situation. This result contradicts the common hypothesis that drainage results in increased C emissions and therefore increased RF of peatlands. The negative radiative forcing due to drainage is caused by increases in CO2 sequestration in peat (-0.5 mW m(-2)), tree stands and wood products (-0.8 mW m(2) ), decreases in CH4 emissions from peat to the atmosphere (-1.6 mW m(-2)), and only a small increase in N2O emissions (+0.1 mW m(-2) ). Although the calculations presented include many uncertainties, the above results are considered qualitatively reliable and may be expected to be valid also for Scandinavian countries and Russia, where most forestry-drained peatlands occur outside Finland.

AB Question: Flood disturbance in peatlands can create temporary or permanently submerged areas where tolerant species may persist and replace intolerant species over time. Fen moss species and communities occur along a hummock-hollow gradient in natural ecosystems, but their resistance and resilience to different durations of submergence has yet to be tested. We asked what are the short- and long-term effects of submergence duration on four common boreal fen moss species and the implications for ecosystem resilience?
   Location: Rich fen near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.
   Methods: To examine the effect of submergence duration on fen moss species and communities, we harvested and submerged monoculture plugs dominated by Hamatocaulis vernicosus, Sphagnum warnstorfii, Tomentypnum nitens and Aulacomnium palustre in the field under rich fen water for 1-8 weeks. After submergence, we planted the plugs in bare peat at the same site to evaluate the short- and long-term responses of each species and changes in moss community composition over time.
   Results: We found that moss species response to duration of submergence is not strictly related to their occurrence along a hummock-hollow gradient and that tolerant species maintain or restore moss cover. H. vernicosus was most tolerant to submergence of all durations, whereas S. warnstorfii was nearly eliminated by submergence. Over the long term, more tolerant species replaced less tolerant species, increasing diversity and moss community resilience. Overall, moss communities without S. warnstorfii were resilient to 4 weeks of submergence because T. nitens and H. vernicosus maintained dominance or established where the cover of less resilient species was limited.
   Conclusions: We show that moss species varied in their responses to submergence duration, resulting in shifts in community composition and long-term effects on community resilience with longer durations of submergence. This provides insight into how moss communities provide stability to peatlands in response to disturbance through shifts in community composition that support tolerant dominant species.

AB Arctic regions contain large amounts of organic carbon (OC) trapped in soil and wetland permafrost. With climate warming, parr of this OC is released to aquatic systems and degraded by microorganisms, thus resulting, in positive feedback due to carbon (C) emission. In wetland areas, water bodies are spatially heterogenic and separated by landscape position and water residence time. This represents a hydrological continuum, from depressions, smaller water bodies and lakes to the receiving streams and rivers. Yet, the effect of this heterogeneity on the OC release from the soil and its processing in waters is largely unknown and not accounted for in C cycle models of Arctic regions. Here we investigated the dissolved OC (DOC) biodegradation of aquatic systems along a hydrological continuum located in two discontinuous permafrost sites: in western Siberia and northern Sweden. The biodegradable dissolved OC (BDOC15; %DOC lost relative to the initial DOC concentration after 15 days incubation at 20 degrees C) ranged from 0 to 20% for small water bodies located at the beginning of the continuum (soil solutions, small ponds, fen and lakes) and from 10 to 20% for streams and rivers. While the BDOC15 increased, the removal rate of DOC decreased along the hydrological continuum. The potential maximum CO2 production from DOC biodegradation was estimated to account for only a small part of in-situ CO2 emissions measured in peatland aquatic systems of northern Sweden and western Siberia. This suggests that other sources, such as sediment respiration and soil input, largely contribute to CO2 emissions from small surface waters of permafrost peatlands. Our results highlight the need to account for large heterogeneity of dissolved OC concentration and biodegradability in order to quantify C cycling in arctic water bodies susceptible to permafrost thaw.

AB Organobromine (Br(org)) compounds, commonly recognized as persistent, toxic anthropogenic pollutants, are also produced naturally in terrestrial and marine systems. Several enzymatic and abiotic bromination mechanisms have been identified, as well as an array of natural Brorg molecules associated with various marine organisms. The fate of the carbon-bromine functionality in the marine environment, however, remains largely unexplored. Oceanographic studies have noted an association between bromine (Br) and organic carbon (C(org)) in marine sediments. Even so, there has been no direct chemical evidence that Br in the sediments exists in a stable form apart from inorganic bromide (Br(inorg)), which is widely presumed conservative in marine systems. To investigate the scope of natural Brorg production and its fate in the environment, we probed Br distribution and speciation in estuarine and marine sediments using in situ X-ray spectroscopy and spectromicroscopy. We show that Br(org) is ubiquitous throughout diverse sedimentary environments, occurring in correlation with C(org) and metals such as Fe, Ca, and Zn. Analysis of sinking particulate carbon from the seawater column links the Brorg observed in sediments to biologically produced Br(org) compounds that persist through humification of natural organic matter (NOM). Br speciation varies with sediment depth, revealing biogeochemical cycling of Br between organic and inorganic forms as part of the burial and degradation of NOM. These findings illuminate the chemistry behind the association of Br with C(org) in marine sediments and cast doubt on the paradigmatic classification of Br as a conservative element in seawater systems.

AB Knowledge of past local to regional climate variability is a priority research area as the magnitude of climate change at these scales can be greater than at the global level. Peatlands are sensitive to hydro-climate change and represent a significant carbon (C) pool in the terrestrial biosphere. Here, we applied a multi-proxy approach (bulk density, loss on ignition, total organic carbon, testate amoebae, delta C-13 in Sphagnum, plant macrofossils, pollen and charcoal) and Bayesian statistics to a peat sequence from a mountain ombrogenous bog (Taul Muced) to explore how changes in hydrological conditions, peat plant composition and disturbances have affected long-term physical peat properties and the rate of C accumulation over the last ca. 8800 years. We found that C accumulation at this site ranged from 7 to 105 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (mean 23 +/- 14 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Climatic conditions exerted a direct influence on the peat's plant composition and subsequently affected C accumulation through litter characteristics and abundance, whereas disturbances had a weak effect. Carbon accumulation was greater (31 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) at times of wetter and warmer conditions when Sphagnum was dominant, and lower (17 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) during periods of mixed Sphagnum and vascular plant (mainly sedges) growth under drier/unstable hydrological conditions. Future climate projections of warmer temperatures and greater annual precipitation could therefore positively influence the C sink potential of this peatland. On the other hand, increased anthropogenic pressure in the future may negatively impact the C accumulation. Our study strengthens the geographical coverage of proxy reconstructions of past hydrological variability and highlights the carbon-sink capacity of mountain bogs in a so far understudied region.

AB Nitrogen (N) deposition has increased in the last few decades with implications for the functioning of Sphagnum mosses, the main peat forming genus in peatlands. However, there are few in situ measurements of the carbon balance, especially where the N additions have been realistically manipulated in the field, and none with respect to the effect of N form. The aim of this study was to look at the effects of experimental N additions as oxidized or reduced N, with and without phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), on CO2 fluxes from Sphagnum capillifolium hummocks in a long-term N addition experiment, Whim bog, in the Scottish Borders. In situ static chamber measurements were made during 2008 on 20 plots (control, and N treatments receiving 56 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) of either nitrate (NO3-) or ammonium (NH4) added, with and without PK) to assess N effects on CO2 exchange. Almost all the measured fluxes were negative, i.e. Sphagnum hummocks lost CO2 to the atmosphere, irrespective of the treatments applied. N treatment did not have a significant effect on ecosystem respiration (ER) or net ecosystem productivity (NEP) but adding PK with N increased gross photosynthesis (P-G) significantly, compared to the other treatments. Summed monthly averages of NEP for each treatment indicated that increasing N deposition increased CO2 loss from the system. The form of N affected the response: compared to the control, adding nitrate increased the CO2 loss more than ammonium, both with and without PK. Nitrogen (both forms). increased the ecosystem respiration fluxes at a certain temperature, adding PKwith N further enhanced the response. The positive (increasing) temperature response of ecosystem respiration with N suggests that in high N deposition areas the potential increase in ecosystem respiration, CO2 loss, will be exacerbated with climate change.

AB Root exudates are a direct link between primary production in higher plants and methanogenesis. The relationship has been widely studied on rice paddies, but less is known about its role in wetlands populated by naturally occurring species. This study provides information about the amount and composition of root exudates produced by a widespread mire plant, Eriophorum vaginatum L. For this purpose, E. vaginatum plants were grown in quartz sand in pots from April to October, and root exudates were collected once a month by percolation of the cultivation substrate. In June and October, a set of plants was labelled with (CO2)-C-14 for two days and subsequently harvested for the determination of dry weight and for root exudates collected by the dipping method. The study supports earlier findings that natural wetland plants can enhance methanogenesis in their rhizosphere via active and seasonally varying exudation, but that the amount of exuded carbon (C) is many times lower than that delivered via finer formation. At both harvests in June and October, the proportion of incorporated radioactivity in shoots. roots and exudates was 92-96%. 4-8%, and 0.2%. respectively. New C was primarily fixed in the metabolically important carbohydrates, as well as acid anions that composed the main compounds of the new exudates. However. microbes seemed to rapidly metabolise the exudates into other substances like acetate. This was the dominant compound in the rhizoplane and rhizosphere, and it was the only detected substance that occur-red in higher amounts outside the roots than inside them. Further studies in the field. including the quantification of gaseous end products, are necessary to complete our understanding of the carbon cycling in E. vaginatum-soil-microbe-system.

AB Hydrological conditions play a key role in the carbon cycle of northern peatlands. This study examines the evapotranspiration (ET) dynamics and its impact on the water and energy balance in response to differing meteorological conditions during the exceptionally dry year 2006 and the normal wet year 2007 at a boreal peatland in Finland. Energy and water vapor fluxes were determined continuously using the eddy covariance approach. Daily ET rates varied considerably during the growing season and averaged 2.23 +/- 0.15 mm d (1) and 1.59 +/- 0.07 mm d (1) in the dry and wet year, respectively. Synoptic weather conditions as reflected by incoming radiation and water vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were the key factors controlling ET. Differences in the precipitation patterns and summer temperature also accounted for some of the observed differences in ET between the 2 years. No evidence was found for a relationship between ET rates and water table level, probably due to the relatively high water table level even in the dry year. Latent heat flux dominated the energy balance, particularly in the dry year 2006 with 60% of cumulative precipitation returned to the atmosphere through ET. In the wet year 2007, runoff dominated the water loss, and only 36% of the cumulative precipitation was returned to the atmosphere through ET. While the annual water balance regime of the peatland was mainly regulated by the precipitation pattern, daily measured ET was closely related to potential evaporation, and latent heat flux could be well modeled by the Penman-Monteith approach, suggesting two feasible schemes for ET prediction in peatlands under well watered conditions.

AB Testate amoebae and stable isotopes have been used as surface-moisture proxies in peatlands. However, adequate modern calibration is critical to successful application and interpretation. Testate amoebae, delta C-13 of Sphagnum, and environmental conditions were examined at 126 sites within 12 peatlands of south-central and central Alaska to assess the potential of testate amoebae and delta C-13 as surface-moisture proxies. Results indicate that water-table depth and pH were both correlated with testate amoeba community composition. However, the relative importance of these two variables varied, with pH more important in wetter habitats and water-table depth more important in drier habitats. Cross-validation of transfer functions indicated that water-table depth and pH can be inferred from testate amoeba communities with mean errors of similar to 8 cm and similar to 0.4 pH units, respectively, an improvement over previous calibration work in the region. However, application of these transfer functions should consider potential temporal variability in the relative importance of pH and water-table depth, and we applied our calibration data set to a subfossil testate amoeba record to highlight how knowledge of changes in the relative importance of these environmental variables can inform interpretation. In contrast with testate amoebae, delta C-13 of Sphagnum was found to be a relatively weak indicator of water-table depth. Variable carbon sources for Sphagnum photosynthesis, such as CO2 released by methanotrophic bacteria, likely complicate the relationship between delta C-13 and moisture. Although more work is needed before delta C-13 of Sphagnum can be used as a proxy for water-table depth, testate amoebae should be useful in paleoenvironmental studies of peatlands in Alaska.

AB Spatial or temporal forest-peatland transition zones were proposed as potential hot spots of methane (CH4) emissions. Consequently, paludified soils are an important component of boreal landscape biogeochemistry. However, their role in the regional carbon cycle remains unclear. This study presents CH4 fluxes from two forest-peatland transition zones, two wet forest sites and two clear-cut sites which were compared to fluxes of open peatlands and dry forest. The median fluxes measured using the closed-chamber technique varied from - 0.04 to 12.6 mg m(-2) h(-1) during three climatically different years. The annual mean CH4 emissions of the forest-peatland transition zone were significantly lower than the fluxes of the open peatland sites, 7.9 +/- 0.5 and 21.9 +/- 1.6 g m(-2)a(-1), respectively. The dry forest site was characterized by a small uptake of CH4 (- 2.3 +/- 0.2 g m(-2)a(-1)). Although clear-cut forest area drastically increased in European Russia during the last two decades, if water level depths in these forests remains below 10 cm they do not act as CH4 sources. Fluxes of CH4 from the transition zone sites showed a higher response to soil temperature than to water table level. Fluxes of CH4 between the atmosphere and the two investigated peatlands were not significantly different, although a significant difference in water table level could be observed. The meteorological conditions of the investigated summers changed from being hot and dry in 2013 to cold and wet in 2014; the summer of 2015 was characterized as warmer and drier in the first half and colder and wetter in the second half. Significant differences in CH4 fluxes were measured only between 2014 and 2013. Significant differences in CH4 fluxes and in nonlinear regressions showed that the CH4 fluxes of the different site types such as dry forests, transition zones and open peatlands need to be modelled separately on a landscape level. Obviously, underlying processes vary with the ecosystem and (along with regional aspects) have to be understood first before large-scale modelling is possible.

AB We used national scenario analyses to examine the effects of fertilization, use of improved regeneration material and ditch network maintenance (DNM), both separately and simultaneously, on timber production of Finnish forests under the current climate. We also analyzed how the area of artificial regeneration, forest fertilization, and DNM developed in different management and harvesting intensity scenarios. The initial data were obtained from the 11th National Forest Inventory of Finland, excluding protected forests. Four sets of even-flow harvesting scenarios with annual timber harvest targets of 60, 70, 80, and 90 million m(3) were developed for 90-year simulation period. Use of improved material in artificial forest regeneration was assumed to result in 10% higher diameter and height increment compared to naturally regenerated seedlings. Sub-xeric pine-dominated and mesic spruce-dominated sites were fertilized, and 40% of drained peatlands were maintenance-ditched when they fulfilled a set of predetermined criteria for temperature sum, stand basal area, and mean tree diameter. As a result, when fertilization, improved regeneration material, and DNM were all used, the mean annual volume increment over the 90-year simulation period increased by 3.4-5.4 million m(3) depending on harvesting intensity. The maximum sustainable harvest of timber would be almost 80 million m(3) yr(-1). The simulated fertilization area was about four times larger than the presently fertilized area, and the simulated DNM area was about the same as the current. Fertilization gave the largest additional 90-year volume increment and the DNM the smallest when they were used separately. The use of improved regeneration material gave the largest additional volume increment in southern Finland and fertilization in central and northern Finland.

AB A suitable packing material for biofiltration of monoaromatic solvent vapors was selected among various types of packing materials such as peat, bark chips, vermiculite, and Hydroballs. A previously isolated strain, Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes BTXO2, which could utilize toluene, m- and p-xylene as carbon and energy sources was used as a biofilter inoculum, Four glass biofilters (6 cm dia, x 60 cm) were individually packed with each of the packing materials and solvent vapors were passed through the columns. During three weeks of peat biofilter operation, average removal efficiencies of toluene, m- and p-xylene were 90.4%, 95.3%, and 82:1%, respectively. With the other packings, the efficiencies were in the range of 10.1 to 58.6% which were significantly lower than those of the peat biofilter. The peat biofilter was continually operated for approximately nine months and the biofilter sustained its degradation activity during the operation period with minimal maintenance, At steady state, average removal rates of toluene, m- and p-xylene vapors were estimated as 14.2, 5.5, and 8.1 g m(-3) packing h(-1) respectively.

AB Knowledge about dissolved oxygen (DO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) distribution in lakes has increased considerably over the last decades. However, studies about high resolution dynamics of dissolved CO2 in different types of lakes over daily or weekly time scales are still very scarce. We measured summertime vertical DO and CO2 profiles at sub-hourly intervals during one week in eight Estonian lakes representing different lake types according to European Water Framework Directive. The lakes showed considerable differences in thermal stratification and vertical distribution of dissolved oxygen and CO2 as well as different diurnal dynamics over the measurement period. We observed a continuous CO2 supersaturation in the upper mixed layer of the alkalitrophic (calcareous groundwaterfed) lake and the dark soft-water lake showing them as CO2 emitting "chimneys" although with different underlying mechanisms. In three lake types strong undersaturation with CO2 occurred in the surface layer characterising them as CO2 sinks for the measurement period while in another three types the surface layer CO2 was mostly in equilibrium with the atmosphere. Factor analysis showed that DO% in the surface layer and the strength of its relationship with CO2% were positively related to alkalinity and negatively to trophic state and DOC gradients, whereas deeper lakes were characterised by higher surface concentration but smaller spatial and temporal variability of CO2. Multiple regression analysis revealed lake area, maximum depth and the light attenuation coefficient as variables affecting the largest number of gas regime indicators. We conclude that the trophic status of lakes in combination with type specific features such as morphometry, alkalinity and colour (DOC) determines the distribution and dynamics of dissolved CO2 and DO, which therefore may indicate functional differences in carbon cycling among lakes.

AB This study proposed a strategy for selecting an optimal propulsion system of a liquefied hydrogen tanker. Four propulsion system options were conceivable depending on whether the hydrogen BOG (boil-off gas) from the cryogenic cargo tanks was used for fuel or not. These options were evaluated in terms of their economic, technological, and environmental feasibilities. The comparison scope included not only main machinery but also the BOG handling system with electric generators. Cost-benefit analysis, life-cycle costing including carbon tax, and an energy efficiency design index were used as measures to compare the four alternative systems. The analytic hierarchy process made scientific decision-making possible. This methodology provided the priority of each attribute through the use of pairwise comparison matrices. Consequently, the propulsion system using LNG with hydrogen BOG recovery was determined to be the optimal alternative. This system was appropriate for the tanker that achieved the highest evaluation score. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB We modify the soil component of the ORCHIDEE terrestrial carbon cycle model to include vertically-discretized soil carbon. With this model, we investigate the feedback of considering thermal insulation by soil carbon, which modifies the soil thermal regime by lowering the thermal conductivity and increasing the heat capacity of a carbon-rich soil, on the total carbon stocks the model builds up. In addition, we demonstrate the effects of diffusive vertical mixing of soil organic matter by cryoturbation on the total carbon stocks that the model builds up in mineral soils in equilibrium with a steady climate. We show that including these two effects together leads to up to 30% higher soil carbon stocks in the top meter of permafrost soils, as well as large stocks of carbon below 1m in the upper permafrost soil layers. The vertical profile of partitioning of carbon between different lability pools is also affected, as the slower pools are more deeply mixed; also the time to reach equilibrium lengthens considerably. These effects are largest in the coldest regions such as Eastern Siberia. The inclusion of cryoturbative mixing and insulation by soil carbon leads to better agreement with estimates of high-latitude soil carbon stocks, where substantial amounts of carbon are found in permafrost regions, to depths of three meters; however we do not include peat, Yedoma, or alluvial deposition processes here, so the total carbon stocks are still lower than observed.

AB The sensitivity of peatland carbon (C) fluxes to changes in climate and hydrology are uncertain due to the complex interactions between plants and peat properties. In this study we examine how peat cores taken from under three plant functional types (PFT) (bryophyte, graminoid and ericoid) differ in their biotic and abiotic properties and how this indirectly modulates the response of C fluxes to environmental change. Peat cores taken from under three PFTs had their aboveground vegetation removed to exclude direct plant-mediated effects, and were incubated in a temperature x water table factorial experiment at 12, 14 and 16 degrees C (air temperature) with the water table level -25, -15 or -5 cm below the peat surface. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured over 11 months. Emissions of CO(2)and CH(4)increased with temperature, with strong positive (CH4) and negative (CO2) interactions with increasing water table level. There were significant effects of removed PFT on the environmental sensitivity of CH4, but not CO(2)fluxes. CH(4)emissions were greatest in peat with graminoid PFT removed at the warmest temperature but these indirect effects were not explained by peat abiotic or biotic properties, which did not differ between PFTs. These results show that climate change-induced expansion of graminoids in northern peatlands will have direct and indirect effects on C fluxes and the stability of peatland C stores. These responses will be determined by the interactive effects of vegetation composition, hydrology and warming on methane-cycling microbial communities. Highlights
   Peatland carbon flux strength under a changing climate is influenced by PFT. Peat from under graminoid PFT emits more methane than peat from under bryophyte or ericoid PFT. Prior PFT cover influenced methane emissions, but did not affect peat abiotic or biotic properties. Increases in graminoid cover with climate change could indirectly increase peatland methane fluxes.

AB Posidonia oceanica forms extensive peat-like deposits (mats) in Mediterranean coastal waters, which have a potential as carbon sinks and archives of environmental change. Nonetheless, the organic chemistry of both P. oceanica plant materials, as well as the environmental and diagenetic effects on the composition of its detritus, is poorly understood. We analyzed plant organs of P. oceanica and the coarse organic matter from a mat core spanning 750 yrs using pyrolysis techniques (PY-GC-MS and THM-GC-MS) to improve our understanding of their molecular properties and their preservation upon mat development. It appeared that leaf sheaths, roots and the outer parts of rhizomes were composed predominantly of phenolic constituents based on p-hydroxybenzoic acid (p-HBA), which is atypical for vascular plants, in addition to carbohydrates and lignin. The inner rhizome and leaf blades had a different composition, with predominance of carbohydrates. The seagrass detritus in the mat was composed mainly of p-HBA phenolic material and carbohydrates, confirming earlier studies showing that the coarse detritus in the mat originates largely from Posidonia sheath, root and rhizome debris. The intermolecular arrangement of the p-HBA remains unclear, as they seem to correspond to ester-bound phenols yet their persistence in the mat attributes them a refractory nature. Variations in molecular composition within the mat are probably associated with diagenetic alteration of P. oceanica detritus, such as the decomposition of minor amounts of fatty acids, chlorophyll and syringyl lignin, and selective preservation of p-HBA relative to carbohydrates. This work lays the foundations for a molecular understanding of carbon storage within the mats and the environmental changes recorded therein. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatland soils are estimated to store a third of all terrestrial carbon stocks and are very sensitive to climate change. In these systems, one group of soil mesofauna, enchytraeid worms (Annelida, Oligochaeta), represent up to 70% of total soil fauna biomass and previous studies have highlighted their potential use as 'biological indicators' for functionally important changes in the C cycle.
   To examine the link between temperature, enchytraeids and carbon fluxes we performed a microcosm experiment in which we assessed the influence of temperature on enchytraeid populations and soil CO2 and DOC release from a Galician peatland soil over 90 days. Additionally, to unravel the potential underlying mechanisms responsible for DOC production, we also tested the effects of increasing temperatures and enchytraeid activities on the presence of organic chelating metals (iron and aluminium) and hydrogen ions (i.e. acidity) in the soil solution.
   Enchytraeid population numbers and biomass increased over time at both temperature treatments (14 and 19 degrees C), with the greatest increase produced at the highest temperature (to over five and seven times higher initial values, respectively, by day 88). Results also showed that, under warmer conditions, enchytraeid activities increased both CO2 fluxes and DOC release by twofold (Q(10) values of 3.9 and 3.6, respectively).
   The combined effect of temperature and enchytraeids promoted the breakdown of organic substances and consequently, more DOC and iron were leached. An important decline in H+ release was observed when enchytraeids were present and possibly eliminating one of the critical mechanisms restricting DOC release. These leachate pH values were also responsible for aluminium immobilisation and hence for its insignificant role in the export of DOC from the peat soil.
   We conclude that temperature change alone does not explain all the observed increases in soil respiration and DOC production but rather soil invertebrate responses to warming are crucial in controlling C fluxes in peatland soils. This is the result of temperature induced changes of enchytraeid populations and activities which have the potential of speeding up the decomposition of organic matter and altering soil aeration, metal mobilization and acidity of the soil solution, with important implications for the global carbon cycle.
   There is an urgent need for incorporating the response of soil biology in climate change modelling to make better predictions of future changes in terrestrial carbon pools.

AB Sub-daily variations in the rates and dominance of the main controls of stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (production, mobility and instream processes) have the potential to create a subtle sub-daily rhythm of DOC variation in streams. We used high-frequency data, covering the spring-summer-autumn period, which included discharge, specific conductivity, pH, groundwater levels, temperature, evapotranspiration and solar radiation to investigate the interplay between factors potentially driving diel DOC cycles in northern catchments. We focused on a peatland dominated 1st order stream (0.65 km(2)) before investigating the propagation of the signals downstream to a 2nd order stream (3.2 km(2)), with a lower percentage of peat fringing the stream channel. DOC cycles in the 1st order stream had a median peak time of 14:00 h and temporally varying amplitude, with a median of 0.61 mgl(-1). Results supported the hypothesis that diel DOC cycles at the site are driven by hydrological processes, specifically the viscosity-effect theory: viscosity-driven increases in flow from the riparian area in the afternoon flush DOC from the peat to the stream. The temporal variability in the amplitude of the diel DOC cycle was controlled by antecedent temperature. Downstream, the did DOC signal was weaker, with around 4-fold lower amplitudes and minima in the afternoon. The lower proportion of riparian peat downstream appeared to reduce the influence of terrestrial processes on DOC cycles. In-stream photodegradation and decomposition likely became more dominant as connectivity between DOC sources and stream reduced. The study highlighted that even in climates such as the Scottish Highlands, where energy input is relatively low and precipitation frequent, sub-daily hydrological and biogeochemical rhythms occur. Unravelling the intricacy of such diel cycles is fundamental to fully understanding stream functioning and the global carbon cycle.

AB Surface waters associated with peatlands, supersaturated With CO2 and CH4 with respect to the atmosphere, act as important pathways linking a large and potentially unstable global repository of C to the atmosphere. Understanding the drivers and mechanisms which control C release from peatland systems to the atmosphere will contribute to better management and modelling of terrestrial C pools. We used non-dispersive infra-red (NDIR) CO2 sensors to continuously measure gas concentrations in a beaver pond at Mer Bleue peatland (Canada): measurements were made between July and August 2007. Concentrations of CO2 in the surface water (10 cm) reached 13 mg, C l(-1) (epCO(2) 72) and 26 mg C l(-1) (epCO(2) 133) at depth (60 cm). The study also showed large diurnal fluctuations in dissolved CO2 which ranged in amplitude from similar to 1.6 mg C l(-1) at 10 cm to similar to 0.2 mg C l(-1) at 60 cm depth. CH4 concentration and supersaturation (epCH(4)) measured using headspace analysis averaged 1-47 mg C l(-1) and 3252, respectively: diurnal cycling was also evident in CH4 concentrations. Mean estimated evasion rates of CO2 and CH4 over file summer period were 44.92 +/- 7.86 and 0.44 +/- 0.25 mu g C m(-2)s(-1), respectively. Open water at Mer Bleue is a significant summer hotspot for greenhouse gas emissions within the catchment. Our results suggest that CO2 concentrations during the Summer in beaver ponds at Mer Bleue are strongly influenced by biological processes within the water column involving aquatic plants and algae (in situ photosynthesis and respiration). In terms of carbon cycling soil-stream connectivity at this time of, Year is therefore relatively weak. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We compared greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and albedo of a pristine boreal bog and an adjacent abandoned peatland pasture in western Newfoundland, Canada to estimate the magnitude of radiative forcing (RF) created by agricultural drainage and abandonment. Our results indicated that these anthropogenic activities induced a climate cooling effect (negative RF), with the magnitude of the RF caused by the albedo change comparable to that induced by altered GHGs. Although the albedo-induced RF was positive in winter and negative in summer, the summer effect dominated because of greater solar radiation received. The climate cooling effect of GHGs change was due to an increase in the carbon dioxide sink capacity and a reduction in methane emissions under lower water table levels following agricultural drainage and abandonment. Calculation of sustained-flux global warming/cooling potentials also supported this finding. Our results show that the overall increase in albedo resulting from agricultural drainage and abandonment contributes significantly to the negative RF, strengthening the cooling effect due to the changing GHG fluxes. Therefore, changes in albedo due to altered vegetation coverage and hydrology and GHG fluxes should be considered when assessing the climatic impacts from land-use change in northern peatland.

AB Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle due to their large C storage potential. Their C sequestration rates, however, highly vary depending on climatic and geohydrological conditions. Transitional mires are often characterised by floating peat with infiltration of buffered groundwater or surface water. Sphagnum mosses grow on top, producing recalcitrant organic matter and fuelling large C stocks. As Sphagnum species strongly differ in their tolerance to the higher pH in these mires, their species composition can be expected to influence C dynamics in transitional mires.
   We therefore experimentally determined growth and net C sequestration rates for four different Sphagnum species (Sphagnum squarrosum, S. palustre, S. fallax and S. magellanicum) in aquaria, with floating peat influenced by the infiltration of buffered water. Surprisingly, even though the first three species increased their biomass, the moss-covered peat still showed a net efflux of CO2 that was up to 3 times higher than that of bare peat. This species-dependent C release could be explained by Sphagnum's active lowering of the pH, which triggers the chemical release of CO2 from bicarbonate.
   Our results clearly illustrate that high Sphagnum biomass production may still coincide with high C emission. These counterintuitive C dynamics in mire succession seem to be the result of both species-and biomass-dependent acidification and buffered water infiltration. Together, these processes can explain part of the large variation in C fluxes (ranging from C sequestration to C release) reported for pristine mires in the literature.

AB Peatlands have been recognised as having a significant role in the mediation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels with direct implications for global climate change. Longitudinal in situ measurement systems for CO(2)concentrations in blanket peatland ecosystems are difficult to implement where the nature of terrestrial-aquatic connectivity and hydrodynamics have a significant effect on the carbon cycle. The need for greater data on CO2 concentrations and flux monitoring in these settings has been well recognised. However, applying the most appropriate monitoring approach presents a special challenge. This paper sets out the development of a direct method for field based longitudinal CO(2)concentration measurement. Based on experiential considerations a new approach is presented that addresses the complexity associated with the high diurnal dynamics of CO2 evasion during mid-winter in an Irish blanket peatland soil-water system. The paper outlines the significance of a direct in situ continuous measurement strategy using a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensor to evaluate CO2 concentrations. The CO2 concentrations recorded as part of this study showed significant differences between the pond waters and the peat waters. The overall CO2 concentration trend did not correlate with the temperature patterns. Further monitoring is essential to evaluate the spatial and longitudinal trends in carbon dynamics. Outputs of this study will have a direct bearing on approaches to carbon flux determinations for this landscape type and will provide an important input to future efforts to explore carbon-hydrodynamics in the surface and subsurface waters of blanket peatlands.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) in arctic and boreal soils is the largest terrestrial reservoir of carbon. Increased SOM mineralisation under increased temperature has the potential to induce a massive release of CO2. Precise parameterisation of the response of arctic soils to increased temperatures is therefore crucial for correctly simulating our future climate. Here, we investigated the temperature response of SOM mineralisation in eight arctic soil profiles of Norway, Svalbard and Russia. Samples were collected at two depths from both mineral and organic soils, which were affected or not by permafrost and were incubated for 91 days at 4, 8, 12, and 16 degrees C. Temperature response was investigated through two parameters derived from a simple exponential model: the intensity of mineralisation, alpha, and the temperature sensitivity, Q10. For each sample, SOM quality was investigated by C-13-NMR, whereas bacterial and fungal community structure was characterised by T-RFLP and ARISA fingerprints, respectively. When estimated from the whole incubation period, alpha proved to be higher in deep permafrost samples than in shallow active layer ones due to the presence transient flushes of mineralisation in deep permafrost affected soils. At the end of the incubation period, after mineralization flushes had passed, neither alpha nor Q10 (averaging 1.28 +/- 0.07) seemed to be affected by soil type (organic vs mineral soil), site, depth or permafrost. SOM composition and microbial community structure on the contrary where affected by site and soil type. Our results suggest that deep samples of permafrost affected soil contain a small pool of fast cycling carbon, which is quickly depleted after thawing. Once the mineralization flush had passed, the temperature response of permafrost affected soil proved to be relatively homogenous among sample types, suggesting that the use of a single temperature sensitivity parameter in land surface models for SOM decomposition in permafrost-affected soils is justified.

AB The results of studies of the content and stocks of organic carbon in the block "litter soil" of pine ecosystems in Zhytomyr and Chernihiv Polissia are presented. The forest ecosystems are important stabilizers of the carbon cycle as well as stocks of carbon. The components of the forest ecosystem are interconnected by the flows of energy and substances. Binding CO2 in the block of "plant-soil", followed by the transformation of carbon into insoluble humus compounds is of particular importance. In the research area sod - light-podzolic and sod-medium-podzolic soils on fluvioglacial sands are mostly spread. These soils belong to the category of old arable ones. Present here are also peat marsh soils. It is shown that the process of humus accumulation is characterized by low intensity, which is caused by a complex of reasons, in particular, the sandy composition of sod-podzolic soils (particle content < 0,01 mm 7,5 %).The thickness of the profile humus portion is 18 cm. The average content of humus is 0,97 %, and reserves 28,3 t/ha in a 20-cm layer. Similar indicators of carbon are 0,56 % and 16,4 t/ha, respectively. Organic substance of sod-podzolic soils of pine habitats is resistant to mineralization and for a long time is removed from the cycle of substances of the pine ecosystem. The average carbon content in hydromorphic organogenic soils increases to 18,1 % and its stocks are 168,9 t/ha. The ability for mineralization peat soils is lower than that of sod-podzolic soils. So, they have a high carbon sequestration capacity. Pine litter reserves on the average are 30-33 t/ha, and carbon reserves on the average are 12,6 t/ha, with its stable content 40 %.The total carbon reserves in the block "litter soil" of a typical pine ecosystem of Polissia are on average 29 t/ha, with the bulk of them being concentrated in the soil. Considering that highly productive pine forests are formed on the infertile soils of Polissia, their afforestation will not only stop the intensive degradation of soils of Ukraine, but also will increase the deposition of greenhouse gases, which will help to prevent further climate change at the regional level.

AB The effect of solar radiation on the dissolved absorption coefficient (a(CDOM)[lambda]), which reflects the concentration of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), was investigated in several lakes near Bariloche, Argentina and in northeastern Pennsylvania, USA. Samples of 0.2 mum filtered lake water were exposed in quartz tubes to different portions of the solar spectrum using optical cutoff filters to remove parts of the ultraviolet (UV) region of the solar spectrum. Changes in the spectral absorption in these samples and the absorbed incident energy were used to calculate spectral weighting functions (SWFs) for the photobleaching (PB) of CDOM. PB was measured as the loss of a(CDOM)(lambda) (the a(CDOM)[lambda] was averaged from 280 to 500 nm) per unit absorbed energy. CDOM from humic and clear lakes, as well as from a Sphagnum bog and an algal culture, was used in the experiments covering a wide range of carbon sources, We used an iterative, nonlinear optimization method to fit the measured results to a simple exponential function in order to generate each SWF. Comparing individual SWFs calculated for various CDOM sources, we computed a summary SWF from the experiments using epilimnial CDOM from our study lakes. Our summary SWF was able to explain 80-90% of the observed variance in our exposure experiments, and we were able to predict PB results obtained for other Argentine lakes (mean error 14.5%). Finally, we calculated that the effect of UV-B radiation on PB was small (< 20% of total decrease in the absorption coefficient) compared to U-VA and blue light radiation. This suggested that increased UV-B radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion would not greatly increase the photobleaching of whole water column CDOM in Patagonian lakes (< 10%).

AB Saltwater intrusion and inundation can affect soil microbial activity, which regulates the carbon (C) balance in mangroves and helps to determine if these coastal forests can keep pace with sea level rise (SLR). This study evaluated the effects of increased salinity (+15 ppt), increased inundation (-8 cm), and their combination, on soil organic C loss from a mangrove peat soil (Everglades, Florida, USA) under simulated tides. Soil respiration (CO2 flux), methane (CH4) flux, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production, and porewater nutrient concentrations were quantified. Soil respiration was the major pathway of soil organic C loss (94-98%) and was approximately 90% higher in the control water level than the inundated treatment under elevated salinity. Respiration rate increased with water temperature, but depended upon salinity and tidal range. CH4 flux was minimal, while porewater DOC increased with a concomitant, significant decline in soil bulk density under increased inundation. Porewater ammonium increased (73%) with inundation and soluble reactive phosphorus increased (32%) with salinity. Overall, the decline in soil organic C mineralization from combined saltwater intrusion and prolonged inundation was not significant, but results suggest SLR could increase this soil's susceptibility to peat collapse and accelerate nutrient and DOC export to adjacent Florida Bay.

AB Anthropogenic and environmental pressures on wetland hydrology may trigger changes in carbon (C) cycling, potentially exposing vast amounts of soil C to rapid decomposition. We measured soil CO2 efflux (R-s) continuously from 2009 to 2010 in a lower coastal plain forested wetland in North Carolina, U.S., to characterize its main environmental drivers. To understand and quantify the spatial variation due to microtopography and associated differences in hydrology, measurements were conducted at three microsites along a microtopographic gradient. The seasonal hysteresis in R-s differed by microtopographic location and was caused by the transitions between flooded and nonflooded conditions. Because flooded R-s was small, we reported R-s dynamics mainly during nonflooded periods. A nested model, modified from conventional Q(10) (temperature sensitivity) model with dynamic parameters, provided a significantly better simulation on the observed variation of R-s. The model performed better with daily data, indicating that soil temperature (T-s) and water table depth (WTD) were the primary drivers for seasonal variation. The diel variation of R-s was high and independent of T-s and WTD, which both had small diel variations, suggesting the likely association with plant activity. Overall, the site-average soil CO2 efflux was approximately 960-1103gCm(-2)yr(-1) in 2010, of which 93% was released during nonflooded periods. Our study indicates that R-s is highly linked to hydroperiod and microtopography in forested wetlands and droughts in wetlands will accelerate soil C loss.

AB Hummocks. small earth or peat mounds, are widely distributed in the arctic and develop a., a consequence of biomass accumulation and cryoturbation in the active layer. There is general agreement that the type of vegetation covering peat hummocks may alter the accumulation rate of organic material and thus hummock growth and local carbon sink dynamics. Studies on hummock plant community compositions from the arctic are very scarce. Here, I present results of a case study from the arctic tree-line near Churchill, Manitoba (Canada). Vegetation composition, hummock height and soil moisture content were recorded in 40 peat hummocks located along a tree-line gradient from open forest to tundra. Based on a cluster analysis I found three moss-dominated types of hummock vegetation, according to (1) a Tomenthypnum nitens (golden fuzzy fen moss) type on low hummocks, (2) a Hylocomium spledens (stair-step moss) type on medium-sized hummocks, and (3) a Pleurozium schreberi (red-stemmed feathermoss) type on hummocks higher than 60-70 cm. I found hummock height to increase towards the forest interior with decreasing water content of the upper organic layer on the hummock top. This is indicated by a significant change in vegetation composition towards drought resistant moss species on higher hummocks. Furthermore, species richness decreased with increase in hummock height. Based on evidence from historical tree-line invasion the overall results suggest that hummock height increases due to peat accumulation over the course of time resulting in a typical change in plant community composition.

AB Today wildfire is an important disturbance in many continental ecosystems, and it is assumed that with ongoing climate changes the frequencies and impacts of wildfires will increase in many regions. One way to obtain information about the potential long term influences of wildfires on ecosystems and the climate system itself is to study palaeo-wildfires. A total of 140 Jurassic samples, including 122 coal samples and 18 rock samples from roof and floor of coal seams, were collected from 4 coalfields in Northwestern China. The samples were analyzed by macropetrography, microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, gas chromatography, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to study the evidences of wildfires and their impact on the paleoclimate. High contents of pyrogenic inertinites (charcoal), natural char and natural coke particles observed in the samples which indicate that widespread wildfire events occurred in the early Middle Jurassic in all over Northwestern China. Additionally, high-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were detected in the coal samples. These aromatic compounds were formed under high temperature and provide further evidence of wildfires. According to a carbon emission model for modern forest fires, the total carbon and gas emissions from wildfires in peat swamps of the Middle Jurassic in Northwest China were calculated by the data from 21,575 coal samples of number of 1567 drill core samples. The total carbon released from peat-swamp forest wildfires was at least 1207 Gt, corresponding to emissions of CO2, CO and CH4 of 1926 Gt, 163 Gt, and 8.8 Gt, respectively. The huge amount of CO2 released by forest fires in the peat swamp systems of the Middle Jurassic in Northwestern China alone was equivalent to 64.20% of the total CO2 in the atmosphere at present (3000Gt). The large amounts of greenhouse gases released by wildfires must have led to long-term changes in the atmospheric composition and have caused global warming, which could have the reason of affected the paleoclimate.

AB The Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database was developed in order to determine carbon pools in soils of the northern circumpolar permafrost region. The area of all soils in the northern permafrost region is approximately 18,782 x 10(3) km(2), or approximately 16% of the global soil area. In the northern permafrost region, organic soils (peatlands) and cryoturbated permafrost-affected mineral soils have the highest mean soil organic carbon contents (32.2-69.6 kg m(-2)). Here we report a new estimate of the carbon pools in soils of the northern permafrost region, including deeper layers and pools not accounted for in previous analyses. Carbon pools were estimated to be 191.29 Pg for the 0-30 cm depth, 495.80 Pg for the 0-100 cm depth, and 1024.00 Pg for the 0-300 cm depth. Our estimate for the first meter of soil alone is about double that reported for this region in previous analyses. Carbon pools in layers deeper than 300 cm were estimated to be 407 Pg in yedoma deposits and 241 Pg in deltaic deposits. In total, the northern permafrost region contains approximately 1672 Pg of organic carbon, of which approximately 1466 Pg, or 88%, occurs in perennially frozen soils and deposits. This 1672 Pg of organic carbon would account for approximately 50% of the estimated global belowground organic carbon pool.

AB Drained peatlands are known to be important sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). While CO2 emissions occur mainly during the growing season, large N2O emissions may occur during the non-growing season as well. Peatland re-wetting may be an effective measure to prevent those emissions. However, recent research shows that re-wetted peatlands may release large amounts of methane (CH4) during the years immediately after re-wetting whereas abandonment of intensive grassland on drained peat soils possibly leads to low nutrient supply and thus to small greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here we examine the role of extensification practices (such as abandonment of mineral fertilisation, reduced cutting frequency and a cattle-free winter period) on GHG emissions from a temperate peatland during winter. From November 2009 to March 2010 GHG measurements were made on a minerotrophic fen five years after intensive grassland use was abandoned. During the measurement period CO2 and N2O emissions amounted to 4.4 t ha(-1) and 2.6 t ha(-1) CO2-equivalent, whilst CH4 emissions were negligible. Altogether the site emitted 7 t ha(-1) CO2-equivalent, of which 37 % was N2O, even though the winter 2009/2010 was extraordinarily cold. Thus, extensification of grassland use alone may not be sufficient to reduce GHG emissions from temperate peatlands.

AB Patagonian peatland ecosystems have received very little attention in the scientific literature despite their widespread distribution in the regional landscape and the anthropogenic pressure they experience from the peat extraction industry. The functioning of these southern peatlands is strikingly similar to that of northern peatlands, but they have developed under very different climate boundary conditions. Therefore, studying these ecosystems provides a unique opportunity to test ideas and hypotheses about the sensitivity of carbon-rich peat accumulating ecosystems to climate change, in addition to filling significant data and knowledge gaps. Here we provide a synthesis of detailed peat accumulation records for southern Patagonia using a combination of new peat-core analysis (from 4 sites) and a data review from previously published studies (from 19 sites). We also present the modern climate space (temperature, precipitation, and seasonality ranges) of Patagonian peatlands on the basis of modern peatland distribution and gridded climate data to discuss climate controls of Patagonian peatlands at the present and in the past by inference. Results indicated that Patagonian peatlands occupy a distinct climatological niche that corresponds to an end-member of the northern peatland climate domain, with a mild mean annual temperature (from 3 to 9 degrees C) and very weak temperature seasonality. We also found that Patagonian peatlands have been efficient land carbon sinks since their initiation, with a mean soil carbon density of 168 kg C m(-2) +/- 10%. The total carbon pool for these ecosystems was estimated at 7.6 GtC. Modeled peat addition rates to the catotelm in Patagonian peatlands were significantly higher than what has been reported for northern peatlands, but decay coefficients were similar between these two high-latitude regions. These results support the idea that long, mild growing seasons promote peat formation in southern Patagonia. At the regional scale however, the lack of correlation between climatic parameters and peat accumulation indices suggests that autogenic controlling factors might be at play. Overall, southern peatlands provide a unique opportunity for studying peatland-carbon-climate linkages under a new set of climatic conditions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The most common forest management method in Fennoscandia is rotation forestry, including clear-cutting and forest regeneration. In clear-cutting, stem wood is removed and the logging residues are either removed or left on site. Clear-cutting changes the microclimate and vegetation structure at the site, both of which affect the site's carbon balance. Peat soils with poor aeration and high carbon densities are especially prone to such changes, and significant changes in greenhouse gas exchange can be expected. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and energy fluxes with the eddy covariance method for 2 years (April 2016-March 2018) after clear-cutting a drained peatland forest. We observed a significant rise (23 cm) in the water table level and a large CO2 source (first year: 3086 +/- 148 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1); second year: 2072 +/- 124 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)). These large CO2 emissions resulted from the very low gross primary production (GPP) following the removal of photosynthesizing trees and the decline of ground vegetation, unable to compensate for the decomposition of logging residues and peat. During the second summer (June-August) after the clear-cutting, GPP had already increased by 96% and total ecosystem respiration decreased by 14% from the previous summer. The mean daytime ratio of sensible to latent heat flux decreased after harvesting from 2.6 in May 2016 to 1.0 in August 2016, and in 2017 it varied mostly within 0.6-1.0. In April-September, the mean daytime sensible heat flux was 33% lower and latent heat flux 40% higher in 2017, probably due to the recovery of ground vegetation that increased evapotranspiration and albedo of the site. In addition to CO2 and energy fluxes, we measured methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes with manual chambers. After the clear-cutting, the site turned from a small CH4 sink into a small source and from N2O neutral to a significant N2O source. Compared to the large CO2 emissions, the 100-year global warming potential (GWP100) of the CH4 emissions was negligible. Also, the GWP100 due to increased N2O emissions was less than 10% of that of the CO2 emission change.

AB Ether bonds are found in a wide variety of natural and industrially manufactured xenobiotic compounds and have been associated with the level of recalcitrance of certain environmental pollutants. The main sources of such pollutants released into the environment are formulations of pesticides and detergents. Environmental persistence of a number of these compounds has been implicated as the cause of severe toxicological problems. A selection of representative pollutants are described to illustrate the diversity of their molecular structure, and their microbiological biodegradation and potential toxicity are discussed. A number of mired bacterial cultures and individual strains have evolved the capacity to utilize many of these omnipresent ether-containing compounds as carbon and energy sources; biodegradation is often via the agency of an ether-cleavage mechanism. Biodegradation-competent bacteria exhibit a suprising variety of ether scission. mechanisms. These include those based on oxygenases, cytochrome P-450, hydroxyl shift hydrolysis, anaerobic O demethylation, oxidative mechanisms reductive mechanisms and carbon-oxygen lyases. A unifying feature involving the generation of hemiacetals and beta-elimination is proposed for many of the ether cleavage mechanisms displayed by bacteria.

AB There are 10,091 km(2) of peatlands in Estonia and human activities may have changed the role of northern peatlands from global sinks to global sources of carbon. The aim of this work was to explain the changes in organic carbon exports from eleven Estonian rivers in the period 1992-2007 in terms of land use change, climate change quantified by trends in stream-water discharge and hydrological droughts and reductions in atmospheric sulfate quantified by change in water chemistry. Direct TOC (total organic carbon) measurements had been initiated in 1998. We used CODKMnO4 (permanganate oxygen consumed) as its surrogate for the whole time span (Spearman's determination coefficient in six small northern Estonian rivers 0.95 > rho(2) > 0.72; p < 0.01). The Mann-Kendall test revealed significant trends in the TOC proxy in five small rivers in northern Estonia (M-K stat > 2.35; p < 0.05). The trends in the eleven investigated streams correlated closely with the increased 28 ratios of drought days (Spearman's rho(2) = 0.68; p < 0.01). The correlations with land use compositions, decreases in water discharges and SO4 (2-) concentrations were insignificant (p > 0.05). We conclude that the main factor in the increase of organic carbon export is the deepening of droughts driven by climate change, magnified by man-made drainage.

AB Most Precambrian Shield forested catchments have some wetland component. Even small riparian wetlands are important modifiers of stream chemistry. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is one of the most important products exported by wetlands in streams. Stratigraphic control of hydraulic conductivity generally leads to decreasing conductivity with depth. Thus important flowpaths occur in the uppermost organic rich layers and are reflected in chemical profiles of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Accumulation of DOC in peat porewaters is the net effect of production, consumption and transport. DOC profiles vary with degree of interaction with the surrounding upland catchment and distance from the edge of the wetland as well as internal processes within the wetland. In wetlands, DOM production is offset by flushing resulting in decreasing DOC concentrations with increasing flows. Despite old carbon (2,000 to 3,000 years) at relatively shallow depths, (14)C activity in DOC exported from wetlands is mostly modem (recent carbon), consistent with shallow flowpaths and export of DOM from shallow organic rich horizons. In contrast, the source area for DOM in upland catchments with developed B horizon soils increases with antecedent soil moisture conditions resulting in increasing DOC concentrations with higher stream flows. Activity of 14C in stream DOC from upland catchments span a range from low activities (older carbon) similar to B horizon soil water during dry moisture conditions to values slightly less than modern (more recent carbon) during high moisture conditions. The more modern carbon activities reflect the increased contribution of the organic rich litter and A horizon soil layers in the area immediately bordering the stream under wet antecedent moisture conditions. Reduced hydrologic export or loss of wetlands under drier climatic conditions may result in in larger fluctuations in stream DOC concentrations and reduced DOM loads to lakes.

AB We are conducting a large-scale, long-term climate change response experiment in an ombrotrophic peat bog in Minnesota to evaluate the effects of warming and elevated CO2 on ecosystem processes using empirical and modeling approaches. To better frame future assessments of peatland responses to climate change, we characterized and compared spatial vs. temporal variation in measured C cycle processes and their environmental drivers. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis of a peatland C model to identify how variation in ecosystem parameters contributes to model prediction uncertainty. High spatial variability in C cycle processes resulted in the inability to determine if the bog was a C source or sink, as the 95% confidence interval ranged from a source of 50 g C m(-2) yr(-1) to a sink of 67 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Model sensitivity analysis also identified that spatial variation in tree and shrub photosynthesis, allocation characteristics, and maintenance respiration all contributed to large variations in the pretreatment estimates of net C balance. Variation in ecosystem processes can be more thoroughly characterized if more measurements are collected for parameters that are highly variable over space and time, and especially if those measurements encompass environmental gradients that may be driving the spatial and temporal variation (e.g., hummock vs. hollow microtopographies, and wet vs. dry years). Together, the coupled modeling and empirical approaches indicate that variability in C cycle processes and their drivers must be taken into account when interpreting the significance of experimental warming and elevated CO2 treatments.

AB The importance of mycorrhizas in heathland and boreal forest biomes, which together cover much of the landmass of the Northern Hemisphere and store most of the global stocks of carbon, is reviewed. The taxonomic affinities of the organisms forming these symbiotic partnerships are assessed, and the distinctive structural features of the ericoid mycorrhizas of heathland dwarf shrubs and the ectomycorrhizas of boreal forest trees are described. It is stressed that neither in terms of the geographical distribution of the plants nor in terms of the occurrence of their characteristic mycorrhizas in the soil profile should these biomes be considered to be mutually exclusive. What unites them is their apparent affinity for acidic organic soils of inherently low accessibility of the major nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). These properties relate directly to the nature of the nutrient-poor recalcitrant litter produced by their host plants and through positive-feedback mechanisms that are reinforced by selective removal of labile nutrients by the mycorrhizas. We suggest that coevolution of these plant litter traits with mycorrhizal associations that are adapted to them has been one of the defining features of these ecosystems. Ericoid and ectomycorrhizal fungi have biochemical and physiological attributes that make them highly efficient at scavenging for organic sources of N and P in surface soil horizons. In so doing, they restrict supplies of these elements to the decomposer communities. Case studies involving exploitation of N and P in defined organic substrates are described. In both biomes the dominant plants depend upon the abilities of their fungal partners to recover nutrients, so the symbioses control nutrient cycles, productivity, species composition, and functioning of these ecosystems. It is in this context that the fungal symbionts are here considered to be drivers of nutritional processes in their respective biomes. Through their influences upon the quality of carbon residues mycorrhizal fungi must also affect the sink-source balance for this key element in soil. There is an urgent need for the evaluation of the relative contributions of symbiotic and saprotrophic components of the microflora to the processes of carbon storage and cycling in these biomes, particularly in the context of global climate change and impacts of anthropogenic pollutant N deposition.

AB [1] Mosses are an important component of the boreal forest, but little is known about their contribution to ecosystem carbon, water, and energy exchange. We studied the role of mosses in boreal forest evapotranspiration by conducting two experiments in a black spruce forest in Fairbanks, Alaska. Moss evaporation was measured using lysimeters filled with Hylocomium splendens or Sphagnum capillifolium. Microclimate and moisture content were varied by placing the lysimeters in different habitats ( dense forest, open forest, bog), and by manipulating the water supply (no water, natural rainfall, water added). Moss evaporation rates between 1 June and 8 September averaged 0.3, 0.9, and 1.5 mm day(-1) in the dense forest (Hylocomium), open forest (Hylocomium and Sphagnum), and bog ( Sphagnum) respectively. Assuming a total forest evapotranspiration rate of 2 mm day(-1), this study shows that moss evaporation contributes considerably to boreal black spruce forest evapotranspiration. Moss evaporation rates depended strongly on the openness of the forest and to a lesser degree on the density of the vascular plant canopy and on moss species. The strong influence of habitat suggests that microclimate is the primary factor determining moss evaporation rates. Hylocomium evaporation reacted strongly to experimental water additions, indicating that precipitation frequency is an important factor in addition to microclimate for this species. The large moss evaporation rates in this study suggest a potential cooling effect of mosses, of Sphagnum in particular.

AB Peatlands are known to have accumulated and stored carbon over thousands of years and play a vital role in global greenhouse gas balances. However, there are still inadequate high quality estimates of peatland carbon stock at regional level especially in the James Bay Lowlands in Far North Ontario, Canada. The aim of this study is to estimate regional peatland carbon stock in a delineated watershed region in northern Ontario. SPOT 5 satellite data was used to delineate and classify peatland types using maximum likelihood standard algorithm. The peatland map derived from remote sensing was integrated with peat depth, carbon content and bulk density data in geographic information system (GIS) in order to estimate regional peatland carbon stock. The total regional peatland carbon stock was estimated using the following equation: area of peatland (ha) x depth of peat (m) x mean bulk density of peat (g m(-3)) x carbon content of dry mass (%) x conversion factor (10,000 m(2) ha(-1)). Peatlands in the study area covered a geographic area of about 130,429 ha and stored about 128 +/- 0.05 Tg of carbon. Peat carbon per unit area varied among peatland types with a mean +/- SD of 100 +/- 17 kg C m(-2). This high quality account of carbon stock estimates clearly demonstrates the high carbon stored by northern peatlands which makes them major carbon storehouses.

AB Northern peatlands play an important role in the regulation of the atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) balance, functioning as a net carbon sink with low rates of organic decomposition. However, perturbations such as drainage increase peat oxidation, which may lead to enhanced gaseous release of carbon. For this reason, the number of restoration projects that aim to rewet blanket bogs has increased in the last few years, but there is still a lack of understanding of the impact of restoration on emissions of greenhouse gases, such as methane, particularly in sites restored from forestry. In this paper, we investigate the seasonal greenhouse gas dynamics in a forest-to-bog restoration site in Scotland. We analyse the effects of restoration on both carbon dioxide and methane fluxes, and investigate which site factors (microtopography, vegetation type, soil moisture and temperature) drive the processes of gaseous exchange between the bog surface and the atmosphere. Our results show that the original surface is near greenhouse gase equilibrium at -0.28 gCO(2)eq m(2)center dot day(-1) and that microtopographic features act as a net greenhouse gas sink (ridges = -0.94 gCO(2)eq m(2)center dot day(-1) and furrows = -0.86 gCO(2)eq m(2)center dot day(-1)), whereas the bog pool is a net source of greenhouse gases (0.98 gCO(2)eq m(2)center dot day(-1)). We found different vegetation species play a key role in greenhouse gas flux dynamics, especially in forestry-derived microtopographical features, and their presence and influence on greenhouse gas dynamics should be accounted for to provide a more comprehensive understanding of emissions associated with restoration management practices.
   Highlights
   GHG (CO2 and CH4) dynamics in a boreal peatland restored from forestry are mainly affected by microtopography and vegetation.
   Forestry-derived microforms (ridges and furrows) are better GHG sinks than pools (GHG emitters) and original surfaces (near GHG equilibrium).
   The presence of Trichophorum cespitosum leads to higher CH4 emissions.
   Restoration practices like terraforming may create a short-term pulse net GHG emission due to an increase of both CH4 and CO2 fluxes.

TI Carbon emission from Western Siberian inland waters
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB High-latitude regions play a key role in the carbon (C) cycle and climate system. An important question is the degree of mobilization and atmospheric release of vast soil C stocks, partly stored in permafrost, with amplified warming of these regions. A fraction of this C is exported to inland waters and emitted to the atmosphere, yet these losses are poorly constrained and seldom accounted for in assessments of high-latitude C balances. This is particularly relevant for Western Siberia, with its extensive peatland C stocks, which can be strongly sensitive to the ongoing changes in climate. Here we quantify C emission from inland waters, including the Ob' River (Arctic's largest watershed), across all permafrost zones of Western Siberia. We show that the inland water C emission is high (0.08-0.10 Pg C yr(-1)) and of major significance in the regional C cycle, largely exceeding (7-9 times) C export to the Arctic Ocean and reaching nearly half (35-50%) of the region's land C uptake. This important role of C emission from inland waters highlights the need for coupled land-water studies to understand the contemporary C cycle and its response to warming. Rivers and lakes are thought to be a major conduit of loss for the massive amounts of carbon locked away in high-latitude systems, but such losses are poorly constrained. Here the authors quantify carbon emissions from rivers and lakes across Western Siberia, finding that emissions are high and exceed carbon export to the Arctic Ocean.

AB The function of peatlands as a large carbon (C) reservoir results from the net C uptake under cold, wet, and acid environments. However, in the context of global warming, the balance between C input and release is expected to change, which may further alter the C sink of peatlands. To examine the response to climate warming of a temperate Sphagnum peatland which has been invaded by vascular plants, a mesocosm experiment was conducted with open top chambers (OTCs) to simulate a moderate temperature increase. Gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and methane (CH4) emissions were monitored for 2 years. The CO2 and CH4 fluxes were modeled by relating to abiotic and biotic factors, including temperature, water table depth (WTD), and vegetation, in order to calculate the annual C budget. Results showed that the annual cumulated GPP was significantly enhanced by the simulated warming (-602 compared to -501 gC m(-2) yr(-1) in OTC and control plots, respectively), mainly due to the increase of graminoid biomass by warming, while experimental warming had no significant effect on the annual ER and CH4 emissions (an output of 615 and 500 gC m(-2) yr(-1) for ER; 21 and 16 gC m(-2) yr(-1) for CH4 emissions in OTC and control plots, respectively). The annual NEE and C budget were not affected by the short-term experimental warming. The mesocosms under both treatments acted as a gaseous C source with 34 and 14 gC m(-2) yr(-1) output under OTC and control treatment, respectively. This C source was driven by the strong net carbon dioxide (CO2) release during a low WTD period in summer, as CH4 emissions only accounted for 0.9-2.2% of the total C fluxes. Our study identified the effect of moderate warming on the C fluxes, even on a short-term basis. Also, our findings highlighted that the response of C fluxes to warming largely depends on the WTD and vegetation composition. Thus, long-term monitoring of hydrology and vegetation change under climate warming is essential to examine their interactions in determining the C fluxes in peatlands.

AB Modern climate change in Alaska has resulted in widespread thawing of permafrost, increased fire activity, and extensive changes in vegetation characteristics that have significant consequences for socioecological systems. Despite observations of the heightened sensitivity of these systems to change, there has not been a comprehensive assessment of factors that drive ecosystem changes throughout Alaska. Here we present research that improves our understanding of the main drivers of the spatiotemporal patterns of carbon dynamics using in situ observations, remote sensing data, and an array of modeling techniques. In the last 60 yr, Alaska has seen a large increase in mean annual air temperature (1.7 degrees C), with the greatest warming occurring over winter and spring. Warming trends are projected to continue throughout the 21st century and will likely result in landscape-level changes to ecosystem structure and function. Wetlands, mainly bogs and fens, which are currently estimated to cover 12.5% of the landscape, strongly influence exchange of methane between Alaska's ecosystems and the atmosphere and are expected to be affected by thawing permafrost and shifts in hydrology. Simulations suggest the current proportion of near-surface (within 1 m) and deep (within 5 m) permafrost extent will be reduced by 9-74% and 33-55% by the end of the 21st century, respectively. Since 2000, an average of 678 595 ha/yr was burned, more than twice the annual average during 1950-1999. The largest increase in fire activity is projected for the boreal forest, which could result in a reduction in late-successional spruce forest (8-44%) and an increase in early-successional deciduous forest (25-113%) that would mediate future fire activity and weaken permafrost stability in the region. Climate warming will also affect vegetation communities across arctic regions, where the coverage of deciduous forest could increase (223-620%), shrub tundra may increase (4-21%), and graminoid tundra might decrease (10-24%). This study sheds light on the sensitivity of Alaska's ecosystems to change that has the potential to significantly affect local and regional carbon balance, but more research is needed to improve estimates of land-surface and subsurface properties, and to better account for ecosystem dynamics affected by a myriad of biophysical factors and interactions.

AB Methane (CH4) production is often impeded in many northern peatland soils, even though more thermodynamically favorable inorganic terminal electron acceptors (TEAs) used in anaerobic respiration are often present in low concentrations in these soils. Recent studies suggest that humic substances in wetland soils can be utilized as organic TEAs for anaerobic respiration and may directly inhibit CH4 production. Here we utilize the humic analog anthraquinone-2, 6-disulfonate (AQDS) to explore the importance of humic substances, and their effects on the temperature sensitivity of anaerobic decomposition, in two peatland soils. In a bog peat, AQDS was not initially utilized as a TEA, but greatly inhibited the fermentative production of acetate by >98%, carbon dioxide by >49%, hydrogen by >90%, and CH4 production by 86%. When added together with glucose, <47% of added AQDS was reduced after a lag period of 5 to 10 days. In contrast, no inhibitory effect of AQDS on fermentation was found in a fen peat, and AQDS was readily reduced. The addition of glucose and AQDS to both bog and fen peats caused complicated temporal dynamics in the temperature sensitivity of CH4 production, reflecting temporal changes in the temperature responses of other decomposition processes with effects on methanogenesis. Our results show that the inhibitory effects of a humic analog on CH4 production depend on peatland type, acting primarily as a toxic compound in bog soils and as a competitive TEA in fen soils. The results also suggest that the high concentrations of humic substances in northern peatlands may impact the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon cycling in these ecosystems.

AB [1] If boreal peatlands face drought more often due to climatic warming, the responses of vegetation may drastically change the functions of the ecosystem. We assessed the effects of water-level drawdown on plant-mediated organic matter (OM) and nutrient fluxes in a chronosequence of undrained and drained, originally sparsely treed fens. The chronosequence mimicked the reduced growing season moisture predicted by current climate change scenarios. In a pristine state, OM and nutrient fluxes were characterized by annual cycling through graminoids and mosses. Water-level drawdown initiated a "forest succession, '' in which the OM and nutrient cycles shifted from being dominated by graminoids and mosses to dominance by arboreal vegetation in two decades. Simultaneously, the quantity and tissue type composition of annual litterfall, as well as the quantity and allocation of annual nutrient uptake, changed radically. The changes may have contrasting but as yet unexplored implications for the carbon and nutrient balances of these sites.

AB Natural peatlands provide ecosystem services such as carbon storage and habitat, which can be negatively affected (degraded) by the proximity of agricultural land due to lowered water table and increased nutrient deposition. We assessed peat biochemistry and microbial function in the dry, fluctuating and saturated zones of the peat deposits at Moanatuatua (degraded) and Kopuatai (intact) raised bogs in New Zealand to investigate the effects of adjacent agriculture on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Peat C and N density were elevated, due in part to greater bulk density, in the dry and saturated zones at Moanatuatua compared with Kopuatai. Functional capacity (multi-substrate induced respiration) at Moanatuatua was greater than at Kopuatai, and water-soluble C was at lower concentration but more degradable, indicating that microbes were C limited at Moanatuatua but N limited at Kopuatai. Greater microbial function at Moanatuatua infers C inputs may be more rapidly converted to gaseous or waterborne exports, and agriculturally affected peatlands may be more susceptible to losses of labile C. We conclude that proximity to agriculture is likely to have caused changes in chemical properties and altered microbial functioning of restiad bog and has important implications for C and N turnover within these peatland systems.

AB The global loss of peatlands, by drainage or peat extraction, has encouraged measures to restore these ecosystems and their function as carbon sinks. However, there is a potential of high emissions of the potent greenhouse gas CH4 from restored peatlands. Vascular plants, which often dominate restored sites, play a key role in determining the amount of emitted CH4: The plants can either fuel methanogenesis by supplying labile carbon or attenuate methanogenesis by transferring oxygen into the rhizosphere. To quantify the net effect of these counteracting processes, we tested in a two-pronged approach CH4 production, emission, and the underlying processes in (1.) monoliths of three different restored cutover peatlands and in (2.) mesocosms with Eriophorwn vaginatwn, E. angustifolium and Juncos effusus versus controls with Sphagna and bare peat. Despite waterlogged, and thus persisting anoxic conditions, concentrations of dissolved CH4 remained close to zero in all tested monoliths. We ascribe this finding to two factors: The poor decomposability of the peat material, as determined in anoxic incubations, and the availability of alternative electron acceptors that sustained anaerobic respiration and competitively suppressed methanogenesis. While inorganic electron acceptor pools were small and rapidly diminished, dissolved organic matter provided constant electron acceptor capacity, indicating that reducible moieties in the organic matter were continuously re-oxidized in the rhizosphere of all tested vascular plant species. This continuous re-oxidation of the dissolved organic matter correlated with plant growth rates (R-2 = 0.6-0.8), suggesting that supply of oxygen through the aerenchyma of plant roots regenerated electron acceptor capacity in the rhizosphere. Vascular plants may have differential effects on the net ecosystem exchange, however, our findings suggest that CH4 concentrations and emissions may remain low in restored cutover peatlands for months to years. Thus, waterlogging and vascular plant cover of degraded cutover peat lands does not necessarily create hot-spots of CH4 emissions.

AB The patterned microtopography of subarctic mires generates a variety of environmental conditions, and carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) dynamics vary spatially among different plant community types (PCTs). We studied the CO2 and CH4 exchange between a subarctic fen and the atmosphere at Kaamanen in northern Finland based on flux chamber and eddy covariance measurements in 2017-2018. We observed strong spatial variation in carbon dynamics between the four main PCTs studied, which were largely controlled by water table level and differences in vegetation composition. The ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary productivity (GPP) increased gradually from the wettest PCT to the drier ones, and both ER and GPP were larger for all PCTs during the warmer and drier growing season 2018. We estimated that in 2017 the growing season CO2 balances of the PCTs ranged from -20 g C m(-2) (Trichophorum tussock PCT) to 64 g C m(-2) (string margin PCT), while in 2018 all PCTs were small CO2 sources (10-22 g C m(-2)). We observed small growing season CH4 emissions (< 1 g C m -2 ) from the driest PCT, while the other three PCTs had significantly larger emissions (mean 7.9, range 5.6-10.1 g C m(-2)) during the two growing seasons. Compared to the annual CO2 balance (-8.5 +/- 4.0 g C m(-2)) of the fen in 2017, in 2018 the annual balance (-5.6 +/- 3.7 g C m(-2)) was affected by an earlier onset of photosynthesis in spring, which increased the CO2 sink, and a drought event during summer, which decreased the sink. The CH4 emissions were also affected by the drought. The annual CH4 balance of the fen was 7.3 +/- 0.2 g C m(-2) in 2017 and 6.2 +/- 0.1 g C m(-2) in 2018. Thus, the carbon balance of the fen was close to zero in both years. The PCTs that were adapted to drier conditions provided ecosystem-level resilience to carbon loss due to water level drawdown.

AB Blanket peat catchments are important biodiversity refugia and are increasingly recognised for their role in regional carbon and water balances. A key pressure on these catchments is forest clearfelling which increases stream phosphorus potentially leading to eutrophication. However, these unique systems are underrepresented in the development of bioassessment monitoring programmes and so are at risk to impacts. In this study, a multiple before-after-control-impact (MBACI) study was designed in three neighbouring peatland catchments and provided a unique opportunity to assess the impact of forest clearfelling events on macroinvertebrate and phytobenthic assemblages. Statistical analysis revealed substantial differences in the macroinvertebrate assemblages after clearfelling with higher abundances of chironomids. Macroinvertebrate derived indices EPT, diversity and species richness were significantly reduced. This was accompanied by a shift in functional feeding group representation away from shredders and collector-filterers to a dominance of collector-gatherers after clearfelling. In contrast, forest clearfelling did not significantly impact the diatom assemblages and diatom derived indices remained static for the duration of the study period. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Organic matter (OM)-mineral interactions play an important role in OM preservation, global carbon cycling and contaminant transport. Studies have indicated that preferential sorption of OM is dependent on mineral type and solution conditions. In this study, H-1 high resolution-magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (HR-MAS NMR) spectroscopy was employed to examine OM chemistry in organo-clay complexes. Dissolved OM from a forest soil, Leonardite humic acid and Peat humic acid were sorbed to Ca2+ enriched kaolinite and montmorillonite. As observed using H-1 HR-MAS NMR spectroscopy, kaolinite sorbed mainly long-chain aliphatic compounds such as those from plant cuticles whereas montmorillonite sorbed a mixture of aliphatic components and proteins. These results show the preferential sorption of specific dissolved OM components on clay surfaces. This was tested further using solid-state C-13 and H-1 HR-MAS NMR analysis of whole soils containing kaolinite and montmorillonite as well as a Peat soil for contrast. The species present at the soil-water interface were mainly aliphatic components, carbohydrates and amino acids. Aromatic constituents were present in the soils (observed by solid-state C-13 NMR and by H-1 HR-MAS NMR spectroscopy when a more penetrating solvent was used) which signifies that these compounds likely exist in more hydrophobic domains that are buried and surface inaccessible. This study highlights the important role of OM interactions with clay minerals in the preservation of OM in soils and suggests that OM-OM associations may also play a role in the protection of specific OM components in soil.

AB Drainage of peatlands for forestry often leads to carbon dioxide (CO2) net emission from soil due to loss of peat. This emission can be compensated for by the increased tree growth. Hovewer, many drained peatlands have low tree growth due to nutrient limitations. Tree growth at these peatlands can be effectively increased by fertilization, but fertilization has been also found to increase decomposition rates.
   We studied the long-term effect of fertilization of low-productive forestry-drained peatlands on the complete ecosystem greenhouse gas exchange, including both soil and tree component, and accounting for CO2, methane and nitrous oxide. Five N-rich study sites (flark fens and a rich fen) and one N-poor ombrotrophic site were established. Fertilization had started at the study sites 16-67 years before our measurements.
   Fertilization considerably increased tree stand CO2 sink ( + 248-1013 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1)). Decomposition increased on average by 45% ( + 431 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1)) and litter production by 38% ( + 360 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1)). Thus, on average 84% of the increased decomposition could be attributed to increased litter production and 16% to increased soil CO 2 net emission due to increased loss of peat. Soil CO2 net emission correlated positively with water table depth and top soil N concentration.
   Fertilization increased soil CO2 net emission at the drained flark fens on average by 187 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1). At the rich fen, net emission decreased. The N-poor bog exhibited soil CO2 sink both with and without fertilization. Effects on methane and nitrous oxide emissions were small at most sites.
   The increase in tree stand CO2 sink was higher than the increase in soil CO2 net emission, indicating that fertilization has a climate cooling effect in the decadal time scale. Yet, as the fertilized plots at N-rich sites exhibited soil CO2 source or zero balance, continuation of fertilization-based forestry over several rotations would lead to progressive loss of ecosystem C. At the N-poor bog, fertilization-based forestry may have a climate-cooling effect also in the centennial time scale.

AB Mapping peatland extent in Canada would contribute important information concerning carbon balance and hydrology. While such mapping, based on air photo interpretation and remote sensing data, has recently improved, maps have been limited to 1:1 million scale. We hypothesized that forest structure information from forest inventory plots could be used to predict the presence of forested and treed peat lands in boreal Canada at the ground plot-level, and that a resulting model could be used to predict the distribution of forested and treed peatlands across Canada. Inventory ground plots from the Canadian National Forest Inventory (NFI) with organic soil depth measurements were used to create a model of the presence of treed to forested (canopy cover ranging from sparse to closed) peatlands (greater than 40 cm organic soil depth) in boreal Canada. The presence of black spruce (Picea mariana) or larch (Larix laricina), in combination with low stand height and stand age greater than 75 years, were the strongest predictors of the presence of peatlands. Bioclimatic variables related to high diurnal and annual temperature variation, consistent with a continental climate, also contributed to the increased predicted presence of treed peatlands. Both logistic and boosted regression tree models showed similar results, with similar to 87% accuracy in the discrimination of treed peatlands when validated against an independent set of ground plots. The boosted regression tree model was propagated across Canada using forest attribute raster data layers at 250 m resolution from the NFI along with bioclimatic layers. Estimates of treed peatland extent agreed with data points from peat cores with 85-95% accuracy in the Boreal Shield ecozone, although prediction was less accurate in the more southern boreal and Great Lakes forest areas. The resulting map can be used as an input to forest carbon modelling, and the improved knowledge of treed peatland extent will be useful in modelling wildfire or peatland drainage.

AB Vegetation removal with fire can alter the thermal regime of the land surface, leading to significant changes in biogeochemistry (e.g. carbon cycling) and soil hydrology. In the UK, large expanses of carbonrich upland environments are managed to encourage increased abundance of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica) by rotational burning of shrub vegetation. To date, though, there has not been any consideration of whether prescribed vegetation burning on peatlands modifies the thermal regime of the soil mass in the years after fire. In this study thermal regime was monitored across 12 burned peatland soil plots over an 18-month period, with the aim of (i) quantifying thermal dynamics between burned plots of different ages (from <2 to 15 + years post burning), and (ii) developing statistical models to determine the magnitude of thermal change caused by vegetation management. Compared to plots burned 15 + years previously, plots recently burned (<2-4 years) showed higher mean, maximum and range of soil temperatures, and lower minima. Statistical models (generalised least square regression) were developed to predict daily mean and maximum soil temperature in plots burned 15+ years prior to the study. These models were then applied to predict temperatures of plots burned 2, 4 and 7 years previously, with significant deviations from predicted temperatures illustrating the magnitude of burn management effects. Temperatures measured in soil plots burned <2 years previously showed significant statistical disturbances from model predictions, reaching +6.2 degrees C for daily mean temperatures and +19.6 degrees C for daily maxima. Soil temperatures in plots burnt 7 years previously were most similar to plots burned.15 + years ago indicating the potential for soil temperatures to recover as vegetation regrows. Our findings that prescribed peatland vegetation burning alters soil thermal regime should provide an impetus for further research to understand the consequences of thermal regime change for carbon processing and release, and hydrological processes, in these peatlands.

AB Understanding the dynamics of methane (CH4) emissions is of paramount importance because CH4 has 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide (CO2) and is currently the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. Wetlands are the single largest natural CH4 source with median emissions from published studies of 164 Tgyr1, which is about a third of total global emissions. We provide a perspective on important new frontiers in obtaining a better understanding of CH4 dynamics in natural systems, with a focus on wetlands. One of the most exciting recent developments in this field is the attempt to integrate the different methodologies and spatial scales of biogeochemistry, molecular microbiology, and modeling, and thus this is a major focus of this review. Our specific objectives are to provide an up-to-date synthesis of estimates of global CH4 emissions from wetlands and other freshwater aquatic ecosystems, briefly summarize major biogeophysical controls over CH4 emissions from wetlands, suggest new frontiers in CH4 biogeochemistry, examine relationships between methanogen community structure and CH4 dynamics in situ, and to review the current generation of CH4 models. We highlight throughout some of the most pressing issues concerning global change and feedbacks on CH4 emissions from natural ecosystems. Major uncertainties in estimating current and future CH4 emissions from natural ecosystems include the following: (i) A number of important controls over CH4 production, consumption, and transport have not been, or are inadequately, incorporated into existing CH4 biogeochemistry models. (ii) Significant errors in regional and global emission estimates are derived from large spatial-scale extrapolations from highly heterogeneous and often poorly mapped wetland complexes. (iii) The limited number of observations of CH4 fluxes and their associated environmental variables loosely constrains the parameterization of process-based biogeochemistry models.

AB The Permian-Triassic boundary in the Sydney Basin of Australia is coincident with a pronounced decrease in delta(13)C isotopic values of organic carbon, the last coals anywhere in the world for all of the Early Triassic (ca. 6 m.y.) time, and extirpation of the Glossopteris flora at the top of the Illawarra and Newcastle Coal Measures. Coal-bearing paleosols of the latest Permian represent extensive swamplands of the seasonally deciduous Glossopteris nora in a humid cold temperate lowland southwest of an Andean-style volcanic arc. Stone-rolls (large ribs of floor rock up into the coal) within some of the uppermost coals of the Permian coal measures can be interpreted as string bogs of a kind now found in cold climates at latitudes of 68 degrees-70 degrees, which is compatible with a paleomagnetically estimated paleolatitude of 65 degrees-85 degrees S for the Sydney Basin. Paleolatitude was not much different for earliest Triassic time, but paleosols of that age include Inceptisols and Entisols showing substantial chemical and textural weathering, more like soils now forming at latitudes of 40 degrees-58 degrees than those within polar circles. This anomalous high-latitude warmth set in at the Permian-Triassic boundary. Sedimentation rates increased at the boundary marked by geochemically unusual acidification of clay and a dramatic carbon isotopic excursion. These changes in environments and ecosystems can be explained by soil erosion following deforestation implied by the plant extinctions and abundant fungal remains at the Permian-Triassic boundary. Evidence from paleosols can now be added to that from paleontological and isotopic studies showing that disruption of the carbon cycle at the Permian-Triassic boundary resulted in a CO2 or CH4 post-apocalyptic greenhouse paleoclimate.

AB The richness and ecological roles of yeasts in peatlands are largely unknown. This paper presents a review of the literature on yeasts in peatlands and also provides new data with species isolated from peatlands in Saskatchewan, Canada, and West Siberia, Russia. To date, 75 yeast taxa have been reported from peatlands, including 46 identified species and 29 isolates identified only to genus or not at all. This represents 5%-10% of known yeasts and about 10% of all peatland fungi. Cryptococcus, Candida, Pichia, and Rhodotorula are the most prevalent genera, accounting for 58% of known peatland yeast species. We obtained 34 isolates from western Canadian and West Siberian bog and fen peat, including 12 identified species and eight unidentified taxa. Identified taxa comprised mostly species of Candida, Cryptococcus, and Rhodotorula. Unidentified taxa were described based on physiology and morphology. Globally, more species have been reported from bogs than fens (41 vs. 13 taxa), and the species composition differs between the two peatland classes. The effect of depth within the acrotelm on yeast abundance and species composition varies among peatlands. Physiological profiling of the yeasts from our study showed that they can use (poly)saccharides (primarily D-glucose, maltotriose, n-acetyl glucosamine, trehalose, and sucrose), organic acids (primarily D-gluconic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, and succinic acid), sugar alcohols (primarily D-arabitol, D-mannitol, and D-sorbitol), glycosides (primarily arbutin and salicin), and amino acids (primarily L-glutamic acid) as carbon and nitrogen sources. Based on these profiles, yeasts likely access simple polymers that leach from senesced and/or dead plant materials in peatlands and probably play important roles during the initial stages of organic matter decomposition.

AB Wetlands are among the most important natural resources on earth. They are the sources of cultural, economic and biological diversity. With their wealth of stored carbon, wetlands provide a potential sink for atmospheric carbon, but if not managed properly could become sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide and methane. Two important long-term uncertainties have initiated much debate in the scientific community. These are global wetland area and the amount of carbon stored in it. Compilation of relevant databases could be useful in setting up a long-term strategy for wetland conservation. It has been difficult to estimate the net carbon sequestration potential of a wetland, because the rate of decomposition of organic matter and the abundance of methanogenic micro-organisms and fluxes from the sediment are extremely complex, and there are often gaps in relevant scientific knowledge. The present discussion on density distribution of soil organic C in global wetlands could well be instrumental in formulating efficient strategies related to carbon sequestration and reduction of GHG emissions in wetland ecosystems. Effective assessment of wetlands will only take place when the available information becomes accessible and usable for all stakeholders.

AB Mires (bogs and fens) are nutrient-limited peatland ecosystems, the vegetation of which is especially sensitive to nitrogen deposition and climate change. The role of mires in the global carbon cycle, and the delivery of different ecosystem services can be considerably altered by changes in the vegetation, which has a strong impact on peat-formation and hydrology. Mire ecosystems are commonly open with limited canopy cover but both nitrogen deposition and increased temperatures may increase the woody vegetation component. It has been predicted that such an increase in tree cover and the associated effects on light and water regimes would cause a positive feed-back loop with respect to the ground vegetation. None of these effects, however, have so far been confirmed in large-scale spatiotemporal studies. Here we analyzed data pertaining to mire vegetation from the Swedish National Forest Inventory collected from permanent sample plots over a period of 20 yr along a latitudinal gradient covering 14 degrees. We hypothesized that the changes would be larger in the southern parts as a result of higher nitrogen deposition and warmer climate. Our results showed an increase in woody vegetation with increases in most ericaceous dwarf-shrubs and in the basal area of trees. These changes were, in contrast to our expectations, evenly distributed over most of the latitudinal gradient. While nitrogen deposition is elevated in the south, the increase in temperatures during recent decades has been larger in the north. Hence, we suggest that different processes in the north and south have produced similar vegetation changes along the latitudinal gradient. There was, however, a sharp increase in compositional change at high deposition, indicating a threshold effect in the response. Instead of a positive feed-back loop caused by the tree layer, an increase in canopy cover reduced the changes in composition of the ground vegetation, whereas a decrease in canopy cover lead to larger changes. Increased natural disturbances of the tree layer due to, for example, pathogens or climate is a predicted outcome of climate change. Hence, these results may have important implications for predictions of long-term effects of increased temperature on peatland vegetation.

AB This study investigated the abundance, distribution, and composition of microbial communities at the watershed scale in a boreal peatland within the Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF), Minnesota, USA. Through a close coupling of next-generation sequencing, biogeochemistry, and advanced analytical chemistry, a biogeochemical hot spot was revealed in the mesotelm (30- to 50-cm depth) as a pronounced shift in microbial community composition in parallel with elevated peat decomposition. The relative abundance of Acidobacteria and the Syntrophobacteraceae, including known hydrocarbon-utilizing genera, was positively correlated with carbohydrate and organic acid content, showing a maximum in the mesotelm. The abundance of Archaea (primarily crenarchaeal groups 1.1c and 1.3) increased with depth, reaching up to 60% of total small-subunit (SSU) rRNA gene sequences in the deep peat below the 75-cm depth. Stable isotope geochemistry and potential rates of methane production paralleled vertical changes in methanogen community composition to indicate a predominance of acetoclastic methanogenesis mediated by the Methanosarcinales in the mesotelm, while hydrogen-utilizing methanogens predominated in the deeper catotelm. RNA-derived pyrosequence libraries corroborated DNA sequence data to indicate that the above-mentioned microbial groups are metabolically active in the mid-depth zone. Fungi showed a maximum in rRNA gene abundance above the 30-cm depth, which comprised only an average of 0.1% of total bacterial and archaeal rRNA gene abundance, indicating prokaryotic dominance. Ratios of C to P enzyme activities approached 0.5 at the acrotelm and catotelm, indicating phosphorus limitation. In contrast, P limitation pressure appeared to be relieved in the mesotelm, likely due to P solubilization by microbial production of organic acids and C-P lyases. Based on path analysis and the modeling of community spatial turnover, we hypothesize that P limitation outweighs N limitation at MEF, and microbial communities are structured by the dominant shrub, Chamaedaphne calyculata, which may act as a carbon source for major consumers in the peatland.

AB 1. Peatlands are a significant store of global carbon (C) and may be particularly sensitive to climate change. Understanding the drivers of C cycling in peatlands is therefore important for predicting feedbacks to climate change. One such driver may be the identity of component plant species. 2. Moss species contribute significantly to peatland vegetation, yet we understand comparatively little of their role in short-term C cycling and whether that role is consistent regardless of environmental context. 3. We examined the impact of three dominant, co-occurring moss species (Hypnum jutlandicum, Sphagnum capillifolium and Plagiothecium undulatum) on C cycling across a long-term fire frequency experiment, where plots have been burnt every 10 years, every 20 years or have not been burnt since 1954. We measured species effects on in situ net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and decomposition environments, and moss species litter decomposition rates in a laboratory experiment. The fire experiment also provided an ideal opportunity to test whether moss species effects were consistent regardless of context. 4. Moss-dominated patches were on average net sources of CO2 over the main growing period, with Sphagnum-dominated patches showing the lowest NEE. The presence of mosses reduced peat temperature, but this was insufficient to cause differences in the decomposition rate of a standard substrate. Sphagnum and Hypnum litter decomposed more slowly (17 and 16% mass loss, respectively) than Plagiothecium litter (64% mass loss) over a 42-week incubation period. 5. Fire frequency treatments had few effects on measures of C cycling. Moss effects were generally consistent regardless of fire frequency treatment, but Plagiothecium and Sphagnum litter collected from the no-fire plots had higher rates of decomposition than litter collected from the plots burnt more frequently. 6. In summary, postfire, both inter- and intraspecific differences in mosses had significant effects on short-term C cycling. Consequently, changes in both moss species composition and variation within species may need to be taken into account to accurately predict C cycling in peatland ecosystems subject to fire.

AB The drawdown of the water level has been hypothesized to change peatlands from carbon (C) sinks to C sources to the atmosphere as a result of increased oxidation of organic matter. We measured the change in peat thickness (subsidence of peat surface) ca. 60 years after drainage in 273 peatland sites (875 points) representing three nutrient levels of pine fens and five macroclimatic regions from southern to northern Finland, and we calculated the changes in peat C densities and peat C stores using direct measurements and estimates drawn from regression models for C density derived in this study. On average, the peat surface had subsided ca. 22 +/- 17 cm (mean +/- SD), the C density had increased by 26 +/- 15 kg.m(-)3, and the C stores had increased by 5.9 +/- 14.4 kg.m(-2) after drainage. Therefore, the hypothesis that drainage of peatland always makes them sources of C to the atmosphere is incorrect. We concluded that the post-drainage subsidence of peat surface was mainly caused by changes in the physical structure of peat after the removal of water while the oxidation of peat was of less importance. The changes in C density and C stores seemed to be dependent on the input of new C into the system through net primary production, especially through the fine roots of trees. Our results suggest that tree stand development plays an important role in the post-drainage C balance of peat soils.

AB Volcanic ash deposits (tephra) in western Canada are instrumental in providing independent chronologic control for many archaeological and paleoenvironmental sites. In Alberta, tephra are a key chronologic tool in a region where radiocarbon dates are often unreliable because of the prevalence of carbonate-rich bedrock and other "old carbon" sources, such as coal. However, many studies using tephra for age control, particularly archaeological projects, identify tephra simply through field characteristics or light microscopy. In both Alberta and British Columbia, many radiocarbon dates that were used to date key tephra deposits were bulk conventional ages on peat and lake sediments, which are not always reliable. These factors have led to uncertainty in the age and number of Bridge River and Mount St. Helens (MSH) set Y tephra present in the region and incomplete distribution maps. New major-element geochemical analyses from archaeological and sedimentary sites across south-central Alberta, complemented by new analyses of tephra from British Columbia and Saskatchewan, refine the distribution of the Bridge River, MSH Yn and Mazama tephra. New geochemical data, radiocarbon dates, and a detailed overview of proximal MSH set Y stratigraphy and geochemistry show that only one MSH layer, Yn, is present in this region, rather than two MSH set Y tephra as previously suggested. Additionally, re-assessment of age data combined with new geochemical analyses confirm that there is also only one Bridge River tephra. A Bayesian modelled age estimate is determined for MSH Yn based on new AMS dates on the tephra and vetted existing conventional ages, providing a revised age estimate for MSH Yn of 3805-3535 cal BP (mean of 3660 cal BP).

AB Intensified warming in the Arctic and Subarctic is resulting in a wide range of changes in the extent, productivity, and composition of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Analysis of remote sensing imagery has documented regional changes in the number and area of ponds and lakes as well as expanding cover of shrubs and small trees in uplands. To better understand long-term changes across the edaphic gradient, we compared the number and area of water bodies and dry barrens (>100 m(2)) between 1956 (aerial photographs) and 2008-2011 (high-resolution satellite images) for eight similar to 25 km(2) sites near Nejanilini Lake, Manitoba (59.559 degrees N, 97.715 degrees W). In the modern landscape, the number of water bodies and barrens were similar (1162 versus 1297, respectively), but water bodies were larger (mean 3.1 x 10(4) versus 681 m(2), respectively) and represented 17% of surface area compared with 0.4% for barrens. Over the past 60 years, total surface area of water did not change significantly (16.7%-17.1%) despite a similar to 30% decrease in numbers of small (<1000 m(2)) water bodies. However, the number and area of barrens decreased (55% and 67%, respectively) across all size classes. These changes are consistent with Arctic greening in response to increasing temperature and precipitation. Loss of small water bodies suggests that wet tundra areas may be drying, which, if true, may have important implications for carbon balance. Our observations may be the result of changes in winter conditions in combination with low permafrost ice content in the region, in part explaining regional variations in responses to climate change.

AB Bog ecosystems are sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance, including drainage and air pollution. Carbon (C) balance measurements to determine the effect of disturbance on bog functioning are laborious; therefore reliable proxies for C fluxes that could facilitate upscaling from single studies to a larger scale would be valuable. We measured peat CO2 emissions (R (s)), CH4 efflux and vegetation characteristics in four bog areas that formed a gradient from pristine to severely disturbed peatlands, affected by drainage, peat mining, alkaline air pollution and underground oil-shale mining. We expected that sites experiencing higher human impact (i.e., the vegetation was more distinct from that of a natural bog) would have higher R (s) and lower CH4 emissions, but differences in peat C emissions between the most disturbed and pristine sites were not significant. Growing period median R (s) ranged from 0.5 to 2.2 g C m(-2) day(-1) for our plots; methane emissions, measured from July to December were an order of magnitude lower, ranging from -5.9 to 126.7 mg C m(-2) day(-1). R (s) and CH4 emissions were primarily determined by water table depth, as was tree stand productivity. Therefore, stand structural parameters could potentially be good indicators of soil C emissions from poorly drained forested bogs.

TI Erosion of organic carbon in the Arctic as a geological carbon dioxide

AB Soils of the northern high latitudes store carbon over millennial timescales (thousands of years) and contain approximately double the carbon stock of the atmosphere(1-3). Warming and associated permafrost thaw can expose soil organic carbon and result in mineralization and carbon dioxide (CO2) release(4-6). However, some of this soil organic carbon may be eroded and transferred to rivers(7-9). If it escapes degradation during river transport and is buried in marine sediments, then it can contribute to a longer-term (more than ten thousand years), geological CO2 sink(8-10). Despite this recognition, the erosional flux and fate of particulate organic carbon (POC) in large rivers at high latitudes remains poorly constrained. Here, we quantify the source of POC in the Mackenzie River, the main sediment supplier to the Arctic Ocean(11,12), and assess its flux and fate. We combine measurements of radiocarbon, stable carbon isotopes and element ratios to correct for rock-derived POC10,13,14. Our samples reveal that the eroded biospheric POC has resided in the basin for millennia, with a mean radiocarbon age of 5,800 +/- 800 years, much older than the POC in large tropical rivers(13,14). From the measured biospheric POC content and variability in annual sediment yield(15), we calculate a biospheric POC flux of 2.2(-0.9)(+1.3) teragrams of carbon per year from the Mackenzie River, which is three times the CO2 drawdown by silicate weathering in this basin(16). Offshore, we find evidence for efficient terrestrial organic carbon burial over the Holocene period, suggesting that erosion of organic carbon-rich, high-latitude soils may result in an important geological CO2 sink.

AB The extent to which complex interrelationships between plants and microorganisms influence organic matter dynamics is critical to our understanding of global C cycles in changing environments. We examined the hypothesis that patterns of soil microbial activity and functional composition differ among vegetation types in northern peatland ecosystems. Microbial characteristics were compared among peatlands differing in plant growth form (tree, shrub/moss, sedge) in two regions (New York State and West Virginia). Microbial activity (basal respiration) was greater in surface (0-15 cm) than subsurface (15-30 cm) peat and from sites dominated by shrubs and Sphagnum moss (3.9 +/- 0.65 mug C g(-1) h(-1)) compared to forested (1.8 +/- 0.20 mug C g(-1) h(-1)) or sedge-dominated sites (1.9 +/- 0.38 mug C g(-1) h(-1)). Microbial activity was not related to decomposability of peat organic matter among vegetation types, and activity was unexpectedly higher in sites with lower peat pH and higher water table level. Substrate-induced respiration (SIR) did not show a clear pattern among vegetation types, but was greater in surface than subsurface peat. Microbial responsiveness to added glucose was very low. The ratio of basal respiration to SIR varied between 0.39 and 0.72 and, like activity, was highest in shrub/Sphagnum sites. Microbial substrate utilization patterns (assayed with BIOLOG(R) GN plates) also differed between shrub/Sphagnum sites and forest or sedge sites, suggesting that C fluxes were mediated by different assemblages of microorganisms in shrub/Sphagnum peatlands. Principal component (PC) scores indicated more utilization of N-containing compounds and carboxylic acids, and less utilization of carbohydrates by microbial communities in shrub/Sphagnum sites. PC scores were much more variable both within and among vegetation types for sites in West Virginia than in New York State, and a greater diversity of C sources were utilized in WV (57 +/- 3) than NYS (47 +/- 2) peat. Our results suggest a link between microbial respiratory activity and microbial functional composition as they vary among these peatland vegetation types. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Drained thermokarst lake basins cover large areas of northern high latitude lowlands. However, the importance of peat accumulated in these drained basins to carbon (C) cycling is poorly understood. Results are presented here from a permafrost sediment core aimed at investigating site history, lake drainage, apparent carbon accumulation, and paleohydrology in a thermokarst basin on the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta in southwestern Alaska. The results show that a thermokarst lake existed for about 2300 years before it drained and a peatland established in the early 1600s. Average apparent C accumulation rate (CAR) was 12 gC/m(2)/yr over the 2300 years before lake drainage, but increased to 120 gC/m(2)/yr following peatland initiation. After transitioning to a Sphagnum-dominated peatland at similar to 1700 AD, CAR reduced gradually before more than doubling from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. This abrupt increase in CAR was possibly in response to a Pacific climate regime shift in the late 1970s, a transition characterized by a nearly 1.5 degrees C increase in regional average annual temperature. Even after considering the differential decay of recent peat, there was an increase in C accumulation after 1977. Reconstructed water-table depths from subfossil testate amoebae show little change throughout the past three centuries, but there was a pronounced shift in testate amoeba composition after the 1977 temperature change (e.g., absence of Phryganella acropodia type and increase in Hyalosphenia elegans). If the results from peatlands in other drained thermokarst lake basins are consistent with the results from this study, then the C accumulated in these vegetated drained basins under current warming might help offset some of the C released from thawing permafrost and thermokarst features in northern regions.

AB The balance of primary production and decomposition in northern peatlands may shift due to climate change, with potential feedbacks to atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Nitrogen availability will modulate this shift, but little is known about the drivers of soil nitrogen dynamics in these environments. We used a long-term (9 years) open top chamber (OTC) experiment in an ombrotrophic Sphagnum peat bog in sub-arctic Sweden, to test for the interactive effects of spring warming, summer warming and winter snow addition on soil nitrogen fluxes, potential activities of nitrogen cycle enzymes, and soil microbial community composition. These simultaneous measurements allowed us to identify the level of organization at which climate change impacts are apparent, an important requirement for developing truly mechanistic understanding. Organic-N pools and fluxes were an order of magnitude higher than inorganic-N pools and fluxes. Summer warming approximately doubled fluxes of soil organic nitrogen and ammonia over the growing season. Such a large increase under 1 degrees C warming is unlikely to be due to kinetic effects, and we propose that it is linked to an observed seasonal decrease in microbial biomass, suggesting that N flux is driven by a substantial late-season dieback of microbes. This change in N cycle dynamics was not reflected in any of the measured potential peptidase activities. Moreover, the soil microbial community structure was apparently stable across treatments, suggesting a non-specific microbial dieback. Our results show that in these widespread peat bogs, where many plant species are capable of organic-N uptake, organic soil N dynamics are quantitatively far more important than the commonly studied inorganic-N dynamics. Understanding of climate change effects on organic soil N cycling in this system will be advanced by closer investigation of the seasonal dynamics of the microbial biomass and the input of substrates that maintain it.

AB Assessing carbon sink-source relationships in peatlands must be based on the understanding of processes responsible for long-term carbon accumulation patterns. In contrast with ombrogeneous bogs, however, the processes in geogeneous fens are poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution Holocene peat accumulation and macrofossil data from a rich fen (Upper Pinto Fen (UPF)) in west-central Alberta, Canada. The similar to8000-year chronology of a 397 cm peat core was controlled by 20 accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 dates. The paludified peatland initially consisted of diverse brown moss species and some Larix trees but was dominated by Scorpidium scorpioides from 6500 to 1300 calibrated years BR The last 1300 years are characterized by the reappearance of Larix together with abundant woody materials and Cyperaccae, culminating in a sharp increase in Tomenthypnum nitens in the last several decades. During the Scorpidium-dominated period, the peat accumulation pattern derived from 15 14 C dates and 260 bulk density measurements indicates declining mass accumulation rates over time (i.e., convex age-depth curve), in contrast with the standard bog growth model (i.e., concave curve). The analysis of the UPF data using an extended model incorporating variable peat addition rates (PAR) to the catotelm suggests a unidirectional sevenfold decrease in PAR from 191.8 to 26.0 g dry mass.m(-2).year(-1) during the similar to5000-year "convex period". Decreasing vegetation production and (or) increasing acrotelm decomposition could have produced the convex pattern. Decreasing PAR might be owing to autogenically induced changes in local hydrology and nutrient availability, which are pronounced in the moisture-limited climate of the region and in peatlands that have a strong groundwater influence. The convex-pattern model, explicit to the height-induced long-term drying hypothesis, has important implications for building simulation models and for projecting future carbon dynamics of peatlands. Prior to recent human disturbance, the UPF site has a time-weighted mean carbon accumulation rate of 31.1 g C.m(-2).year(-1), ranging from 7.2 to 182.5 g C.m(-2).year(-1) during the last 8000 years. This large variation results from the gradual decline of long-term accumulation and short-term climate-induced accumulation "pulses". The results imply that in the absence of climatic change, peatlands with a convex accumulation pattern will reach their growth limit sooner and that their carbon sequestration capacity will decline faster than would be expected given the concave-pattern model.

AB Boreal peatlands are critical ecosystems globally because they house 30%-40% of terrestrial carbon (C), much of which is stored in permafrost soil vulnerable to climate warming-induced thaw. Permafrost thaw leads to thickening of the active (seasonally thawed) layer and alters nutrient and light availability. These physical changes may influence community-level plant functional traits through intraspecific trait variation and/or species turnover. As permafrost thaw is expected to cause an efflux of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from the soil to the atmosphere, it is important to understand thaw-induced changes in plant community productivity to evaluate whether these changes may offset some of the anticipated increases in C emissions. To this end, we collected vascular plant community composition and foliar functional trait data along gradients in aboveground tree biomass and active layer thickness (ALT) in a rapidly thawing boreal peatland, with the expectation that changes in above- and belowground conditions are indicative of altered resource availability. We aimed to determine whether community-level traits vary across these gradients, and whether these changes are dominated by intraspecific trait variation, species turnover, or both. Our results highlight that variability in community-level traits was largely attributable to species turnover and that both community composition and traits were predominantly driven by ALT. Specifically, thicker active layers associated with permafrost-free peatlands (i.e., bogs and fens) shifted community composition from slower-growing evergreen shrubs to faster-growing graminoids and forbs with a corresponding shift toward more productive trait values. The results from this rapidly thawing peatland suggest that continued warming-induced permafrost thaw and thermokarst development alter plant community composition and community-level traits and thus ecosystem productivity. Increased productivity may help to mitigate anticipated CO2 efflux from thawing permafrost, at least in the short term, though this response may be swamped by increase CH4 release.

AB Natural soil pipes, which have been widely reported in peatlands, have been shown to contribute significantly to total stream flow. Here, using measurements from eight pipe outlets, we consider the role of natural pipes in the transport of fluvial carbon within a 17.4-ha blanket-peat-covered catchment. Concentrations of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) from pipe waters varied greatly between pipes and over time, ranging between 5.3 and 180.6 mg L-1 for DOC and 0.08 and 220 mg L-1 for POC. Pipes were important pathways for peatland fluvial carbon export, with fluxes varying between 0.6 and 67.8 kg yr(-1) (DOC) and 0.1 and 14.4 kg yr(-1) (POC) for individual pipes. Pipe DOC flux was equivalent to 20% of the annual DOC flux from the stream outlet while the POC flux from pipes was equivalent to 56% of the annual stream POC flux. The proportion of different forms of aquatic carbon to total aquatic carbon flux varied between pipes, with DOC ranging between 80.0% and 91.2%, POC from 3.6% to 17.1%, dissolved CO2-C from 2.4% to 11.1% and dissolved CH4-C from 0.004% to 1.3%. The total flux of dissolved CO2-C and CH4-C scaled up to all pipe outlets in the study catchment was estimated to be 89.4 and 3.6 kg yr(-1) respectively. Overall, pipe outlets produced discharge equivalent to 14% of the discharge in the stream but delivered an amount of aquatic carbon equivalent to 22% of the aquatic carbon flux at the catchment outlet. Pipe densities in blanket peatlands are known to increase when peat is affected by drainage or drying. Hence, environmental change in many peatlands may lead to an increase in aquatic carbon fluxes from natural pipes, thereby influencing the peatland carbon balance and downstream ecological processes.

AB Peatlands are major terrestrial stores of carbon (C) of importance to the global climate system. Recent studies have made progress in understanding the climatic controls on the C cycle; however, important interactions between volcanic deposition and peatland C stores remain to be addressed. This study uses a 3000-year peatland record from northern Japan to examine the interactions between carbon accumulation, vegetation community succession and volcanic ash deposition. Plant macrofossil and testate amoebae records are presented alongside records of total organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous. Age-depth models are developed using a Bayesian approach, with seven AMS radiocarbon dates and two identified historical tephras from Baitoushan (AD 969 (981 cal. BP)), and Hokkaido-Komagatake (AD 1640 (310 cal. BP)) volcanoes. Results show that moderate to high tephra loading can shift peatland plant communities from Sphagnum to monocotyledon domination. This vegetation change is associated with increased peat humification and reduced carbon accumulation. Where tephra deposition and reworking has occurred, the apparent rate of carbon accumulation can be halved while high tephra loading of the mire surface is sustained. Sphagnum species vary in their tolerance to tephra deposition. After each ash fall Sphagnum magellanicum disappeared from the plant macrofossil record, whereas Sphagnum papillosum showed apparent continuity of development through the 1856 (94 cal. BP) Ko-c1 tephra. High rates of carbon accumulation (peaking at >100 g m(-2) yr(-1)), 2-3 times faster than the average for northern peatlands, were recorded in the Sphagnum communities that established after the cessation of tephra deposition and reworking from the AD 969 Baitoushan ash fall (B-Tm tephra). This peak in C accumulation was coincident with a radical shift in mire nutrient cycling most probably caused by the interaction of S. magellanicum with leachates from the underlying tephras. The phase of high C accumulation continued for over 300 years, offsetting the initial negative impact of the B-Tm tephra on peatland C accumulation. These results suggest that management for ash-tolerant Sphagnum species could be a highly effective strategy for minimising volcanic disruption to peatland carbon accumulation. The study also shows that consideration of volcanic impacts on peatlands is essential for development of more realistic terrestrial carbon balance models in volcanically active regions.

AB The past similar to 40 years have seen a geometric increase (5-7% per year) in the size of the lesser snow goose (LSG; Chen caerulescens caerulescens) population and marked spatial expansion of the area they inhabit within the coastal fen ecotype of Wapusk National Park (Hudson Bay Lowlands, northern Canada), raising concerns and uncertainty about the environmental effects of their activities (grubbing of vegetation, soil disturbance, deposition of feces) on the abundant shallow tundra ponds. In this study, we use conventional limnological measurements as well as water and carbon (C) isotope tracers to explore similarities and differences in seasonal patterns of hydrological, limnological, and biogeochemical conditions of 15 shallow coastal fen ponds that currently have minimal (if any) disturbance from the LSG population with one pond (WAP 20) that is subject to substantial LSG activity. Carbon isotope measurements reveal that C cycling at WAP 20 (LSG-disturbed site) is markedly different compared to the other ponds, whereas only small differences were observed in hydrological conditions and concentrations of major nutrients and chlorophyll a of pond water. A mid-summer decrease in C isotope composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) occurred at WAP 20, likely as a consequence of high pond-water pH and intense C demand by aquatic productivity. These conditions appear to have promoted "chemically enhanced CO2 invasion," which causes strong kinetic C isotope fractionation. High C demand at WAP 20 is also suggested by mid-summer C-13 enrichment in particulate organic matter. In contrast, the ponds with little to no LSG activity exhibited expected seasonal C isotope behavior (i.e., C-13 enrichment of DIC) under conditions of increasing productivity when C is in relatively low demand. Small differences in nutrient concentrations may be due to rapid uptake by the benthic mat at WAP 20. Data from the low disturbance ponds also provide baseline information for future studies assessing potential effects of LSG.

AB Organic carbon burial in lake sediments plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, and is heavily affected by the terrestrial organic matter input. However, few studies have focused on long-term changes in terrestrial or-ganic matter input to lakes in response to land-use changes. The aim of this study was to assess variations in sedimentary terrestrial organic matter over the last 1000 years based on lignin biomarker records from two sediment cores from Lake Skottenesjon, southwestern Sweden. In combination with pollen-based quantitative land cover reconstruction, we investigated the impacts of centennial-scale land-use changes on terrestrial organic matter input to lake sediments. The results show that human activities in the catchment had significant impacts on terrestrial organic export by modifying the vegetation cover. Intensified use of the forest in the 18th and 19th centuries led to enhanced soil erosion, and increased terrestrial organic matter input to the lake. Although farmland expanded between the 12th and the middle of 14th century, no significant change in terrestrial organic matter input was observed at that time. Much higher export of terrestrial organic and minerogenic matter to the lake was observed during the period of modern forestry in the 20th century as compared to previous periods of minor forest disturbance, such as 11th century. The changes in the vegetation cover in the catchment considerably modified the composition of terrestrial organic matter deposited in the lake sediments, which is reflected by the composition of lignin phenols. This study demonstrates that the combination of lignin phenols analysis and pollen-based quantitative land cover reconstruction is a useful approach for investigating long-term changes in terrestrial organic matter delivery to lake ecosystems.

TI CHANGES IN THERMOPHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF BIOMASS WITH DIFFERENT

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Biomass; pyrolysis; thermophysical characteristics; differential thermal
   analysis; true values
AB The work relevance is caused by the need to study the changes of biomass thermophysical characteristics in its thermal transformation in relation to the design of technological equipment and energy use.
   The main aim of the research is to study the thermophysical characteristics during slow pyrolysis of biomass with different mineralization amount.
   Objects: biomass resources with different amount of mineralization - straw (A(d)=2,8 %), nonconforming wheat bran (A(d)=6,9 %), lowland peat of the Sukhovsky deposit (A(d)=22,8 %).
   Methods. Thermotechnical characteristics of biomass samples and their carbon residue are determined according to certified methods (GOST R 54186-2010 (EN 14774-1: 2009), GOST R 56881-2016 (E1755-01), GOST 11305-2013, 11306-2013, GOST 32990-2014 (EN 15148: 2009)); values of the calorific value were determined using the ABK-1 calorimeter (RET, Russia) in accordance with GOST 147-2013 (ISO 1928-2009); elemental analysis of organic part was carried out on a Vario Micro Cube (Elementar, Germany) device; thermal processing was carried out by differential thermal analysis and physical experiment; the thermophysical characteristics of the biomass and its carbon residue were measured by laser flash method using the thermal conductivity analyzer Discovery Laser Flash 1 (DLF-1); the true density was measured using an automatic gas pycnometer Ultrapyc-1200e (Quantachrome Instruments, USA); the carbon residue structure was studied by scanning microscopy VEGA 3 SBU electron microscope (TESCAN, Czech Republic).
   Results. Straw and bran pyrolysis proceeds in two stages, differing in the average rate of decomposition - (0,38...0,41) %.degrees C-1 and 0,09 %.degrees C-1 respectively. Peat decomposition occurs in the whole temperature range (220-500 degrees C) with an average decomposition rate of 0,11 %.degrees C-1. It was found that the thermal conductivity of carbon residue from straw and bran, which have a relatively low ash content for biomass, does not significantly change up to 400 degrees C, after which this value increases. The heat capacity of these samples increases with the temperature of their production to 300 degrees C, after which it sharply decreases. The carbon residue obtained at 500 degrees C has a higher heat capacity value compared to the residue obtained at 400 degrees C. These changes can be explained by decomposition of biomass organic part components - cellulose and lignin. The heat capacity and the thermal conductivity of sukhovsky peat carbon balance have a high mineralization amount (A(d)=22,8 %), decrease in all temperature range, due to the inorganic components share increase in result of organic part decomposition, which is confirmed by the solid phase density increase.

AB Mapping the extent and locations of peatland at landscape scale has implications for carbon inventories, conservation and ecosystem services assessments. The main aim of this paper was to model and map the extent of northern peat soils while taking into account its uncertainty, and in particular exploring:
   1. the use of radar Sentinel 1 as alternative to optical sensors to reduce problems due to clouds while taking advantage of the seasonality changes and
   2. the use of deep learning for peat classification and as application of Digital Soil Mapping.
   The data sets defining presence or absence of peat in the soil were obtained from different sources and different sampling schemes, densities and distributions. Scotland was used as test case, because of its cloudy weather and fragmented distribution of different types of peat.
   An extension of the scorpan-kriging approach was used. The trend was estimated with different approaches: Generalized Additive Models, RandomForest and deep learning (convolutional neural networks). Each approach produced the probability of belonging to a class and the predicted class for each pixel. The results were assessed using out-of-sample measures.
   In this study 108 combinations of data sets and models (including trend approaches, sets of covariates and modelling of the spatial structure) were assessed. Overall, spatially explicit models performed better. The choice of the statistical method can have a significant impact on the predictive performances, while the sets of environmental covariates had a lower impact. Sentinel-1 with morphological features proved to be a good alternative to optical data for peat mapping. It is important to have balanced data sets representing the distribution of the data, because merging heterogeneous sources of data from different populations does not necessarily improve predictions. The use of deep learning and convolutional neural network provided initial promising results.
   There were large differences in the modelling approaches. These differences and uncertainties need to be taken into account for further modelling such as earth surface modelling or carbon accounting.

AB Climate change mitigation is a global response that requires actions at the local level. Quantifying local sources and sinks of greenhouse gases (GHG) facilitate evaluating mitigation options. We present an approach to collate spatially explicit estimated fluxes of GHGs (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) for main land use sectors in the landscape, to aggregate, and to calculate the net emissions of an entire region. Our procedure was developed and tested in a large river basin in Finland, providing information from intensively studied eLTER research sites. To evaluate the full GHG balance, fluxes from natural ecosystems (lakes, rivers, and undrained mires) were included together with fluxes from anthropogenic activities, agriculture and forestry. We quantified the fluxes based on calculations with an anthropogenic emissions model (FRES) and a forest growth and carbon balance model (PREBAS), as well as on emission coefficients from the literature regarding emissions from lakes, rivers, undrained mires, peat extraction sites and cropland. Spatial data sources included CORINE land use data, soil map, lake and river shorelines, national forest inventory data, and statistical data on anthropogenic activities. Emission uncertainties were evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations. Artificial surfaces were the most emission intensive land-cover class. Lakes and rivers were about as emission intensive as arable land. Forests were the dominant land cover in the region (66%), and the C sink of the forests decreased the total emissions of the region by 72%. The region's net emissions amounted to 4.37 +/- 1.43 Tg CO2-eq yr(-1), corresponding to a net emission intensity 0.16 Gg CO2-eq km(-2) yr(-1), and estimated per capita net emissions of 5.6 Mg CO2-eq yr(-1). Our landscape approach opens opportunities to examine the sensitivities of important GHG fluxes to changes in land use and climate, management actions, and mitigation of anthropogenic emissions.

ID CONCRETE CARBONATION; PROFILES
AB The phenolphthalein indicator method, the pH of slurries method, X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) are all commonly associated with evaluating the carbonation front depth in concrete. Recent research (using a closed chamber method) has indicated that stabilized peat is a net sink of carbon dioxide (CO2) (at least in the short term), as the binder takes in CO2 both from the atmosphere and any CO2 released by oxidized peat. Therefore, the application of carbonation depth techniques to stabilized peat are of interest and are explored in this paper for the first time as a precursor to developing a greater understanding of the carbonation process in this material. The carbonation fronts obtained by XRD, loss on ignition, and FTIR all arose at similar depths, as these methods all identify the depth at which the calcium carbonate concentration is elevated with respect to the baseline (i.e., the maximum advancement of the carbonation front). In contrast, the phenolphthalein method underestimated the carbonation front considerably. The pH of the stabilized peat slurries method gave the depth at which leaching of calcium hydroxide and calcium ions occurred, rather than a carbonation depth, and exceeds the depths determined from the other techniques. Advantages and disadvantages of all techniques are discussed.

AB Plant litter chemistry is a key driver of decomposition in peatlands. This study explored the relative contributions of phylogeny and environment to litter chemistry of peat mosses (Sphagnum), the key peat-forming plants on earth.
   Fifteen Sphagnum species, representing three taxonomic sections ACUTIFOLIA, CUSPIDATA and SPHAGNUM, were sampled across a wide range of hydro-geochemical conditions. For all species we characterised chemical composition within (i) inorganic elements, (ii) carbohydrate polymers (iii) non-carbohydrates.
   The variation in carbohydrates was mostly explained by taxonomic section, suggesting phylogenetic conservation of carbohydrate composition. ACUTIFOLIA species invested relatively more in pectins, whereas CUSPIDATA and SPHAGNUM species invested more in hemicellulose. The composition of non-carbohydrates was mainly influenced by environment, except for some constituents for which the variation was more correlated to phylogeny. Finally, the variation in inorganic element concentrations mostly reflected hydro-geochemical conditions within and between peatlands.
   The separation into an environmentally independent, phylogenetically conserved group of compounds (structural carbohydrates) and an environmentally dependent, variable group of compounds (inorganic elements, non-carbohydrates) has important implications both for understanding patterns in and for upscaling of spatially variable ecosystem processes associated with peat decomposition such as carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Soil carbon, a major component of the global carbon inventory, has significant potential for change with changing climate and human land use. We applied the Century ecosystem model to a series of forest and grassland sites distributed globally to examine large-scale controls over soil carbon. Key site-specific parameters influencing soil carbon dynamics are soil texture and foliar lignin content; accordingly, we perturbed these variables at each site to establish a range of carbon concentrations and turnover times. We examined the simulated soil carbon stores, turnover times, and C:N ratios for correlations with patterns of independent variables. Results showed that soil carbon is related linearly to soil texture, increasing as clay content increases, that soil carbon stores and turnover time are related to mean annual temperature by negative exponential functions, and that heterotrophic respiration originates from recent detritus (similar to 50%), microbial turnover (similar to 30%), and soil organic matter (similar to 20%) with modest variations between forest and grassland ecosystems. The effect of changing temperature on soil organic carbon (SOC) estimated by Century is dSOC/dT = 183e(-0.034T). Global extrapolation of this relationship leads to an estimated sensitivity of soil C storage to a temperature of -11.1 Pg degrees C-1, excluding extreme arid and organic soils. In Century, net primary production (NPP) and soil carbon are closely coupled through the N cycle, so that as temperatures increase, accelerated N release first results in fertilization responses, increasing C inputs. The Century-predicted effect of temperature on carbon storage is modified by as much as 100% by the N cycle feedback. Century-estimated soil C sensitivity (-11.1 Pg degrees C-1) is similar to losses predicted with a simple data-based calculation (-14.1 Pg degrees C-1). Inclusion of the N cycle is important for even first order predictions of terrestrial carbon balance. If the NPP-SOC feedback is disrupted by land use or other disturbances, then SOC sensitivity can greatly exceed that estimated in our simulations. Century results further suggest that if climate change results in drying of organic soils (peats), soil carbon loss rates can be high.

AB This study presents a regional model showing the balance of carbon dioxide and methane fluxes in the Swedish county Jamtland, applying a Global Warming Potential 20-year time horizon (GWP20) to meet the Paris agreement horizon and regional policy goals. The results clearly show the necessity to take both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic emissions into consideration in analyses to be able to make proper priorities in future action strategies. The total annual impact from Jamtland calculated as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq) is an uptake of 2.4 Mton (19 ton per capita). Jamtland shows large annual uptakes in forests (12.7 Mton CO2), but also large emissions of methane (80 kton corresponding to 6.7 Mton CO2eq), mainly from lakes, mires and ruminants. Anthropogenic carbon Greenhous gas emissions are dominated by transportation, working machines and consumption (mainly imported indirect emissions).
   As a complement to GWP also the Absolute Global Temperature Change Potential (AGTP) as degree K response, is presented per sector and total for Jamtland County, for yearly emissions (as a pulse) and continuous emissions over 200 years. A yearly pulse from Jamtland gives a temperature response of about 0 K after 10 years and about -4 mu K (cooling effect) after about 50 years). Using both GWP and AGTP as indicators improves the possibilities to find ways how to optimize regional climate policies to reduce global warming until a specific year.
   Strategies and action plans should be developed focusing on the following:
   - Reduced regional transportation and consumption activity.
   - Increased (prioritized) use of renewable fuels for working machines in forestry and agriculture, as well as for heavy trucks.
   - Evaluate the potential to reduce emissions of methane from wetlands and mires.
   - Increase/optimize carbon dioxide assimilation in forests.

AB Black carbon (BC) plays an important role in carbon burial in marine sediments globally. Yet the sequestration of BC in the Arctic Ocean is poorly understood. Here we assess the concentrations, fluxes, and sources of soot BC (SBC)-the most refractory component of BC-in sediments from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS), the World's largest shelf sea system. SBC concentrations in the contemporary shelf sediments range from 0.1 to 2.1 mg g(-1) dw, corresponding to 2-12% of total organic carbon. The Pb-210-derived fluxes of SBC (0.42-11 g m(-2) yr(-1)) are higher or in the same range as fluxes reported for marine surface sediments closer to anthropogenic emissions. The total burial flux of SBC in the ESAS (similar to 4,000 Gg yr(-1)) illustrates the great importance of this Arctic shelf in marine sequestration of SBC. The radiocarbon signal of the SBC shows more depleted yet also more uniform signatures (-721 to -896%; average of -774 +/- 62%) than of the non-SBC pool (-304 to -728%; average of -491 +/- 163%), suggesting that SBC is coming from an, on average, 5,900 +/- 300 years older and more specific source than the non-SBC pool. We estimate that the atmospheric BC input to the ESAS is negligible (similar to 0.6% of the SBC burial flux). Statistical source apportionment modeling suggests that the ESAS sedimentary SBC is remobilized by thawing of two permafrost carbon (PF/C) systems: surface soil permafrost (topsoil/PF; 25 +/- 8%) and Pleistocene ice complex deposits (ICD/PF; 75 +/- 8%). The SBC contribution to the total mobilized permafrost carbon (PF/C) increases with increasing distance from the coast (from 5 to 14%), indicating that the SBC is more recalcitrant than other forms of translocated PF/C. These results elucidate for the first time the key role of permafrost thaw in the transport of SBC to the Arctic Ocean. With ongoing global warming, these findings have implications for the biogeochemical carbon cycle, increasing the size of this refractory carbon pool in the Arctic Ocean.

TI Rhodoblastus sphagnicola sp nov., a novel acidophilic purple non-sulfur
   bacterium from Sphagnum peat bog

AB An isolate of purple non-sulfur bacteria was obtained from an acidic Sphagnum peat bog and designated strain RST. The colour of cell suspensions of this bacterium growing in the light under anaerobic conditions is purplish red. Cells of strain RST are rod-shaped, 0(.)8-1(.)0 mu m wide and 2(.)0-6(.)0 mu m long, motile by means of polar flagella, reproduce by budding and have a tendency to form rosette-like clusters in older cultures. The cells contain lamellar intracytoplasmic membranes underlying, and parallel to, the cytoplasmic membrane. The photosynthetic pigments are bacteriochlorophyll a and carotenoids; the absorption spectrum of living cells shows maxima at 377, 463, 492, 527, 592, 806 and 867 nm. The cells grow photoheterotrophically under anaerobic or microaerobic; conditions with various organic carbon sources or grow photolithoautotrophically with H-2 and CO2. Strain RST is a moderately acidophilic organism exhibiting growth at pH values between 4(.)8 and 7(.)0 (with an optimum at pH 5(.)2-5(.)5). The major fatty acids are 16:1 omega 7c and 18:1 omega 7c; the major quinones are Q-10 and Q-9. The DNA G+C content of strain RST is 62(.)6 mol%. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the novel isolate is most closely related (97(.)3% sequence similarity) to the type strain ATCC 25092(T) of the moderately acidophilic purple non-sulfur bacterium Rhodoblastus acidophilus, formerly named Rhodopseudomonas acidophila. However, in contrast to Rbl. acidophilus, strain RST is not capable of aerobic growth in the dark, has no spirilloxanthin among the carotenoids and differs in the pattern of substrate utilization. The value for DNA-DNA hybridization between strain RST and Rbl. acidophilus ATCC 25092(T) is only 22 %. Thus, strain RST represents a novel species of the genus Rhodoblastus, for which the name Rhodoblastus sphagnicola sp. nov. is proposed. Strain RST (= DSM 16996(T) = VKM B-2361(T)) is the type strain.

AB Background Fine root production is one of the least well understood components of the carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems. Minirhizotrons allow accurate and non-destructive sampling of fine root production. Small and large scale studies across a range of ecosystems are needed to have baseline data on fine root production and further assess the impact of global change upon it; however, the expense and the low adaptability of minirhizotrons prevent such data collection, in worldwide distributed sampling schemes, in low-income countries and in some ecosystems (e.g. tropical forested wetlands). Results We present EnRoot, a narrow minirhizotron of 25 mm diameter, that is partially 3D printable. EnRoot is inexpensive (euro150), easy to construct (no prior knowledge required) and adapted to a range of ecosystems including tropical forested wetlands (e.g. mangroves, peatlands). We tested EnRoot's accuracy and precision for measuring fine root length and diameter, and it yielded Lin's concordance correlation coefficient values of 0.95 for root diameter and 0.92 for length. As a proof of concept, we tested EnRoot in a mesocosm study, and in the field in a tropical mangrove. EnRoot proved its capacity to capture the development of roots of a legume (Medicago sativa) and a mangrove species (seedlings of Rhizophora mangle) in laboratory mesocosms. EnRoot's field installation was possible in the root-dense tropical mangrove because its narrow diameter allowed it to be installed between larger roots and because it is fully waterproof. EnRoot compares favourably with commercial minirhizotrons, and can image roots as small as 56 mu m. Conclusion EnRoot removes barriers to the extensive use of minirhizotrons by being low-cost, easy to construct and adapted to a wide range of ecosystem. It opens the doors to worldwide distributed minirhizotron studies across an extended range of ecosystems with the potential to fill knowledge gaps surrounding fine root production.

TI PESERA-PEAT: a fluvial erosion model for blanket peatlands

AB In peatlands, fluvial erosion can lead to a dramatic decline in hydrological function, major changes in the net carbon balance and loss of biodiversity. Climate and land management change are thought to be important influences on rates of peat erosion. However, sediment production in peatlands is different to that of other soils and no models of erosion specifically for peatlands currently exist. Hence, forecasting the influence of future climate or spatially-distributed management interventions on peat erosion is difficult. The PESERA-GRID model was substantially modified in this study to include dominant blanket peat erosion processes. In the resulting fluvial erosion model, PESERA-PEAT, freeze-thaw and desiccation processes were accounted for by a novel sediment supply index as key features of erosion. Land management practices were parameterized for their influence on vegetation cover, biomass and soil moisture condition. PESERA-PEAT was numerically evaluated using available field data from four blanket peat-covered catchments with different erosion conditions and management intensity. PESERA-PEAT was found to be robust in modelling fluvial erosion in blanket peat. A sensitivity analysis of PESERA-PEAT showed that modelled sediment yield was more sensitive to vegetation cover than other tested factors such as precipitation, temperature, drainage density and ditch/gully depth. Two versions of PESERA-PEAT, equilibrium and time-series, produced similar results under the same environmental conditions, facilitating the use of the model at different scales. The equilibrium model is suitable for assessing the high-resolution spatial variability of average monthly peat erosion over the study period across large areas (national or global assessments), while the time-series model is appropriate for investigating continuous monthly peat erosion throughout study periods across smaller areas or large regions using a coarser-spatial resolution. PESERA-PEAT will therefore support future investigations into the impact of climate change and management options on blanket peat erosion at various spatial and temporal scales.

AB Bacteria of the genus Burkholderia are a typical component of the microbial complex of Sphagnum peat bogs and constitute a substantial portion of the aerobic chemoorganotrophic isolates which are routinely obtained from these environments on an acidic nutrient media. The ecophysiological characteristics of the 27 strains of such organisms, which were isolated from the peat of acidic Sphagnum bogs of the boreal and tundra zones of Russia, Canada, and Estonia, were investigated in the present study. Most of the Burkholderia strains isolated from these bogs were phylogenetically close to the species B. glathei, B. phenazinium, B. fungorum, and B. caryophylli, the typical inhabitants of soil and plant rhizosphere, The bog isolates utilized a broad ran-e of substrates as carbon and energy sources, including organic acids, sugars, polyalcohols, and certain aromatic compounds. All the strains studied were capable of growth on nitrogen-free media. They developed in the pH range of 3.5 to 7.4 and from 3 to 37 degrees C, with the optima at pH 5-7 and 11-23 degrees C, respectively. They were therefore moderately acidophilic, psychroactive, dinitrogen-fixing microorganisms well adapted to the conditions of acidic northern Sphagnum bogs.

AB Woodlands represent highly significant carbon sinks globally, though could lose this function under future climatic change. Effective large-scale monitoring of these woodlands has a critical role to play in mitigating for, and adapting to, climate change. Mediterranean woodlands have low carbon densities, but represent important global carbon stocks due to their extensiveness and are particularly vulnerable because the region is predicted to become much hotter and drier over the coming century. Airborne lidar is already recognized as an excellent approach for high-fidelity carbon mapping, but few studies have used multi-temporal lidar surveys to measure carbon fluxes in forests and none have worked with Mediterranean woodlands. We use a multi-temporal (5-year interval) airborne lidar data set for a region of central Spain to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB) and carbon dynamics in typical mixed broadleaved and/or coniferous Mediterranean woodlands. Field calibration of the lidar data enabled the generation of grid-based maps of AGB for 2006 and 2011, and the resulting AGB change was estimated. There was a close agreement between the lidar-based AGB growth estimate (1.22 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and those derived from two independent sources: the Spanish National Forest Inventory, and a tree-ring based analysis (1.19 and 1.13 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), respectively). We parameterised a simple simulator of forest dynamics using the lidar carbon flux measurements, and used it to explore four scenarios of fire occurrence. Under undisturbed conditions (no fire) an accelerating accumulation of biomass and carbon is evident over the next 100 years with an average carbon sequestration rate of 1.95 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1). This rate reduces by almost a third when fire probability is increased to 0.01 (fire return rate of 100 years), as has been predicted under climate change. Our work shows the power of multi-temporal lidar surveying to map woodland carbon fluxes and provide parameters for carbon dynamics models. Space deployment of lidar instruments in the near future could open the way for rolling out wide-scale forest carbon stock monitoring to inform management and governance responses to future environmental change.

AB Tropical wetlands have been shown to exhibit high rates of net primary productivity and may therefore play an important role in global climate change mitigation through carbon assimilation and sequestration. Many permanently flooded areas of tropical East Africa are dominated by the highly productive C4 emergent macrophyte sedge, Cyperus papyrus L. (papyrus). However, increasing population densities around wetland margins in East Africa are reducing the extent of papyrus coverage due to the planting of subsistence crops such as Colocasia esculenta (cocoyam). In this paper, we assess the impact of this land use change on the carbon cycle and in particular the impacts of land conversion on net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange. Eddy covariance techniques were used, on a campaign basis, to measure fluxes of carbon dioxide over both papyrus and cocoyam dominated wetlands located on the Ugandan shore of Lake Victoria. Peak rates of net photosynthetic CO2 assimilation, derived from monthly diurnal averages of net ecosystem exchange, of 2835 similar to mu mol CO2 similar to m-2 similar to s-1 and 1520 similar to mu mol CO2 similar to m-2 similar to s-1 were recorded in the papyrus and cocoyam wetlands, respectively, whereas night-time respiratory losses ranged between 10 and 15 similar to mu mol CO2 similar to m-2 similar to s-1 at the papyrus wetland and 510 similar to mu mol CO2 similar to m-2 similar to s-1 at the cocoyam site. The integration of the flux data suggests that papyrus wetlands have the potential to act as a sink for significant amounts of carbon, in the region of 10 similar to t C similar to ha-1 similar to yr-1. The cocoyam vegetation assimilated similar to 7 similar to t C similar to ha-1 similar to yr-1 but when carbon exports from crop biomass removal were accounted for these wetlands represent a significant net loss of carbon of similar magnitude. The development of sustainable wetland management strategies are therefore required to promote the dual wetland function of crop production and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions especially under future climate change scenarios.

We studied CO2 exchange dynamics in 2002 and 2003 at a rewetted cutaway peatland located within the temperate maritime climatic zone. Gross photosynthesis (P-G), ecosystem respiration (R-TOT), and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were observed in a range of microsites representing a hydroseral succession gradient: Typha latifolia - Phalaris arundinacea, Eriophorum angustifolium - Carex rostrata, and Juncus effusus - Holcus lanatus vegetation communities and areas of bare (unvegetated) peat. Annual rainfall was 26% higher in 2002 and 4% lower in 2003 than the long-term average and influenced water table position at all microsites. Observed instantaneous CO2 fluxes varied temporally and spatially at all microsites. Modelled P-G was strongly dependent on irradiation (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) and the Vascular Green Area index (VGA). R-TOT was influenced by the soil temperature at 5 cm depth (T-5cm) and the water table position. All microsites were net sources of CO2 in both years of the study, and higher losses (with the exception of Juncus / Holcus) were observed in 2003 at all microsites. In general, losses followed the trend Juncus / Holcus > Phalaris > Typha > bare peat > Eriophorum - Carex in 2002 and Phalaris > Juncus - Holcus > Typha > Eriophorum / Carex > bare peat in 2003. Losses ranged from -163 to -651 g CO2 - C center dot m(-2)center dot y(-1) in 2002 and -308 to -760 g CO2 - C center dot m(-2)center dot y(-1) in 2003. Considerable wintertime losses were observed at all microsites. The results from this study suggest that these peatlands are vulnerable to interannual variations in climatic inputs and that future predictions of climatic change may make restoration of the C sink function in cutaway peatlands in the temperate maritime climatic zone a considerable challenge in the years ahead.

AB Peatlands are an important store of soil carbon, and play a vital role in global carbon cycling, and when located in close proximity to urban and industrial areas, can also act as sinks of atmospherically deposited heavy metals. Large areas of the UK's blanket peat are significantly degraded and actively eroding which negatively impacts carbon and pollutant storage. The restoration of eroding UK peatlands is a major conservation concern, and over the last decade measures have been taken to try to control erosion and restore large areas of degraded peat. This study utilizes a sediment source fingerprinting approach to assess the effect of restoration practices on sediment production, and carbon and pollutant export in the Peak District National Park, southern Pennines (UK). Suspended sediment was collected using time integrated mass flux samplers (TIMS), deployed across three field areas which represent the surface conditions exhibited through an erosion-restoration cycle: (i) intact; (ii) actively eroding; and (iii) recently re-vegetated. Anthropogenic pollutants stored near the peat's surface have allowed material mobilized by sheet erosion to be distinguished from sediment eroded from gully walls. Re-vegetation of eroding gully systems is most effective at stabilizing interfluve surfaces, switching the locus of sediment production from contaminated surface peat to relatively clean' gully walls. The stabilization of eroding surfaces reduces particulate organic carbon (POC) and lead (Pb) fluxes by two orders of magnitude, to levels comparable with those of an intact peatland, thus maintaining this important carbon and pollutant store. The re-vegetation of gully floors also plays a key role in decoupling eroding surfaces from the fluvial system, and further reducing the flux of material. These findings indicate that the restoration practices have been effective over a relatively short timescale, and will help target and refine future restoration initiatives.

TI Isotope composition of dissolved organic carbon in runoff and peat

AB In the near future, climate change will increasingly affect export of carbon (C) from peatlands. Terminal mineralization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a source of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, CO2, and methane, CH4) for the atmosphere, and may contribute to climatic warming. Quantitative understanding of sources, dispersion pathways, and degradation of DOC produced in peat bogs is important for predictions of global change dynamics. Here we explore the potential of combining C isotope ratios of isotopically stratified, Pb-210-dated peat deposits and C isotope ratios of DOC exported via runoff to determine the depth and age of the predominant DOC source. In a poorly drained, Sphagnum-derived peat bog in the Czech Republic, delta C-13 values of bulk peat increased downcore to a depth of 10 cm. The C isotope signatures of fresh DOC and bulk peat differ only insignificantly, because C isotope changes in maturating peat require multiple microbial modifications of the organic matter taking place over relatively long time periods. Based on 41 samplings of runoff, 70% of exported DOC originated from peat substrate 1 to 10 years old, 2-10 cm deep. Recently photosynthesized DOC (< 1 year old) contributed about 5% to runoff DOC, whereas approximately 25% of exported DOC was derived from peat layers older than 10 years. Because biogenic methane at the study site contained isotopically extremely light C (delta C-13 values of -64.2 to -53.2 parts per thousand), it would seem reasonable to expect residual DOC following partial decomposition to become isotopically heavier. A short-term laboratory incubation of wet peat samples from four depths at mid-summer temperatures indicated more complicated delta C-13 systematics. The initial limited amount of DOC in the leachate was isotopically heavy, compared to bulk peat, but after 18 days delta C-13(DOC) became lower, converging to the C isotope signature of bulk peat. Such delta C-13 systematics can be explained by multi-step isotope effects associated with different reaction rates during substrate decomposition. Limitations of using the combination of within-bog delta C-13 systematics and Pb-210 dating of recent peat accretion are discussed. Horizontal heterogeneity in substrate C isotope signatures is one of the main sources of uncertainty of this approach to DOC source apportionment in peaty soils.

AB Over the millennia, peatlands have sequestered and stored carbon in the form of peat, that today accounts for around 30% of the global soil organic carbon. The peat has formed and accumulated due to the slow decomposition rate of organic matter in waterlogged, anaerobic conditions. The particularly close interdependence of the carbon and water cycles in peatland ecosystems signal the importance of understanding the water cycle to the functioning of peatlands.
   With this aim, the water and energy cycle of an alpine catchment in Italy, which includes a peatland, was studied using the process-based hydrological model GEOtop and a set of in situ measurements over 4 years (2012-2015). This is a challenging modelling exercise that has not been tried before with GEOtop. The catchment is heterogenous with land covers of peatland, grassland, scree and bare rock in a mountainous area. The GEOtop model was able to replicate the energy and water fluxes measured by an eddy covariance tower located in the peatland as well as the volumetric water content and soil temperature of the peatland accurately over the four years. This study shows that a process-based hydrological model can be used to study the water and energy dynamics of a peatland in a mountainous area.

AB Humid tropical forests have the fastest rates of organic matter decomposition globally, which often coincide with fluctuating oxygen (O-2) availability in surface soils. Microbial iron (Fe) reduction generates reduced iron [Fe(II)] under anaerobic conditions, which oxidizes to Fe(III) under subsequent aerobic conditions. We demonstrate that Fe (II) oxidation stimulates organic matter decomposition via two mechanisms: (i) organic matter oxidation, likely driven by reactive oxygen species; and (ii) increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) availability, likely driven by acidification. Phenol oxidative activity increased linearly with Fe(II) concentrations (P < 0.0001, pseudo R-2 = 0.79) in soils sampled within and among five tropical forest sites. A similar pattern occurred in the absence of soil, suggesting an abiotic driver of this reaction. No phenol oxidative activity occurred in soils under anaerobic conditions, implying the importance of oxidants such as O-2 or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in addition to Fe(II). Reactions between Fe(II) and H2O2 generate hydroxyl radical, a strong nonselective oxidant of organic compounds. We found increasing consumption of H2O2 as soil Fe(II) concentrations increased, suggesting that reactive oxygen species produced by Fe(II) oxidation explained variation in phenol oxidative activity among samples. Amending soils with Fe(II) at field concentrations stimulated short-term C mineralization by up to 270%, likely via a second mechanism. Oxidation of Fe(II) drove a decrease in pH and a monotonic increase in DOC; a decline of two pH units doubled DOC, likely stimulating microbial respiration. We obtained similar results by manipulating soil acidity independently of Fe(II), implying that Fe(II) oxidation affected C substrate availability via pH fluctuations, in addition to producing reactive oxygen species. Iron oxidation coupled to organic matter decomposition contributes to rapid rates of C cycling across humid tropical forests in spite of periodic O-2 limitation, and may help explain the rapid turnover of complex C molecules in these soils.

AB Extreme winter events that damage vegetation are considered an important climatic cause of arctic browning-a reversal of the greening trend of the region-and possibly reduce the carbon uptake of northern ecosystems. Confirmation of a reduction in CO2 uptake due to winter damage, however, remains elusive due to a lack of flux measurements from affected ecosystems. In this study, we report eddy covariance fluxes of CO2 from a peatland in northern Norway and show that vegetation CO2 uptake was delayed and reduced in the summer of 2014 following an extreme winter event earlier that year. Strong frost in the absence of a protective snow cover-its combined intensity unprecedented in the local climate record-caused severe dieback of the dwarf shrub species Calluna vulgaris and Empetrum nigrum. Similar vegetation damage was reported at the time along similar to 1000 km of coastal Norway, showing the widespread impact of this event. Our results indicate that gross primary production (GPP) exhibited a delayed response to temperature following snowmelt. From snowmelt up to the peak of summer, this reduced carbon uptake by 14 (0-24) g Cm-2 (similar to 12% of GPP in that period)-similar to the effect of interannual variations in summer weather. Concurrently, remotely-sensed NDVI dropped to the lowest level in more than a decade. However, bulk photosynthesis was eventually stimulated by the warm and sunny summer, raising total GPP. Species other than the vulnerable shrubs were probably resilient to the extreme winter event. The warm summer also increased ecosystem respiration, which limited net carbon uptake. This study shows that damage from a single extreme winter event can have an ecosystem-wide impact on CO2 uptake, and highlights the importance of including winter-induced shrub damage in terrestrial ecosystem models to accurately predict trends in vegetation productivity and carbon sequestration in the Arctic and sub-Arctic.

AB Postdepositional diagenetic processes and behavior of biogenic and other elements in Holocene peatlands have been studied in Ubinskoe and Sherstobitovo bogs of the Baraba forest-steppe zone. Peat contains relatively high concentrations of Fe, Mn, Pb, Hg, Sb, Cd, Cu, and Zn in the upper part of the two sections and S, N, Ca, and Sr in the middle. Microbially mediated processes in peat affect the behavior of pH and Eh and cycles of biogenic elements. Depth-dependent distribution patterns of microorganisms in the two bogs record active cycles of carbon and nitrogen but limited sulfur exchange. Bog waters have Ca-group bicarbonate major-ion chemistry and high concentrations of Al, Fe, Cu, and Zn, due to low pH. High contents of NH4(+), NO3-, and C-org and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the bog waters are implicit indicators of rapid biochemical decomposition and oxidation of organic matter. The low pH of the water and an oxic environment in peat were favorable for the formation of goethite and hydrogoethite in upper peat layers. The formation of hematite and andhydride may be related with past wild fires. Early diagenetic processes lead to precipitation of authigenic minerals, especially, pyrite or less often siderite, calcite, and kaolinite. Reduced conditions maintained the formation of metallic Ni and intermetallic Ni-Cr nanometer particles, as well as precipitation of amorphous silica upon dissolution of aluminosilicate minerals in upper peat intervals.Y

AB (1) Molinia caerulea occurs in peatland vegetation communities. However, under certain environmental and management conditions it may overwhelm the typical peatland vegetation, compromising ecosystem services including carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration and storage. Improved understanding of the effects of M. caerulea on CO2 fluxes in peatland ecosystems will better inform landscape management.
   (2) Photosynthesis at a PPFD of 600 mu mol M-2 S-1 (P-G600), ecosystem respiration and partitioned (heterotrophic and autotrophic) below-ground respiration were calculated from closed-chamber measurements collected over the 2012-2014 growing seasons within two drained M. caerulea dominated peatland catchments in Exmoor National Park, southwest England.
   (3) All CO2 fluxes peaked in mid-summer, in association with increased soil temperature and vegetation growth. During wetter periods, below-ground autotrophic respiration and P-G600 significantly decreased (p = 0.028 and p = 0.002), conversely heterotrophic respiration increased insignificantly (p = 0.081). An empirically derived net ecosystem exchange model estimated the growing season of 2012 to have been a smaller CO2 sink in carbon equivalents (-126 +/- 243 g m(-2)) than subsequent growing seasons (-146 +/- 310 and -234 +/- 325 g m(-2)) due to lower photosynthetic rates during a cool, wet summer (2012).
   (4) Management aimed at preserving the carbon store and increasing carbon sequestration through raising water tables may reduce photosynthesis and increase heterotrophic respiration unless the dominance of M. caerulea is reduced and Sphagnum spp. cover increased.

AB Ombrotrophic peatlands (bogs) act as important terrestrial sinks of organic carbon (C). These ecosystems are widespread in coastal maritime regions of eastern Canada. This study aims to evaluate and compare Holocene peatland C dynamics between two maritime ecoclimatic regions along the St. Lawrence North Shore. The investigated bogs are located on two postglacial deltas along the Estuary (Baie-Comeau) and the Gulf of St Lawrence (Havre-St-Pierre) in eastern Quebec. Long-term apparent rates of C accumulation (LORCA) are calculated for eight peat cores, and temporal variations in C accumulation are compared between six peatlands. Our data suggest that long-term C sequestration is affected by a constant anoxic decay, but the LORCA are considerably lower in Havre-St-Pierre (16-46 g C/m(2)/yr) than in Baie-Comeau (53-68 g C/m(2)/yr). The interactions between water table levels, peat humification and C accumulation are also evaluated and suggest an influence of internal (autogenic) processes and feedbacks. The bogs of the two regions show distinct patterns of C sequestration and different sensitivities to climate especially during the late Holocene. These results show that in spite of the internal influences, the regional climate has exerted a pervasive control on primary production in these peatlands over the Holocene.

AB The Archaea represent a significant component of the plant microbiome, whereas their function is still unclear. Different plant species representing the natural vegetation of alpine bogs harbor a substantial archaeal community originating from five phyla, 60 genera, and 334 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). We identified a core archaeome for all bog plants and ecosystem-specific, so far unclassified Archaea. In the metagenomic data set, Archaea were found to have the potential to interact with plants by (i) possible plant growth promotion through auxin biosynthesis, (ii) nutrient supply, and (iii) protection against abiotic (especially oxidative and osmotic) stress. The unexpectedly high degree of plant specificity supports plantarchaeon interactions. Moreover, functional signatures of Archaea reveal genetic capacity for the interplay with fungi and an important role in the carbon and nitrogen cycle: e.g., CO2 and N-2 fixation. These facts reveal an important, yet unobserved role of the Archaea for plants as well as for the bog ecosystem.
   IMPORTANCE Archaea are still an underdetected and little-studied part of the plant microbiome. We provide first and novel insights into Archaea as a functional component of the plant microbiome obtained by metagenomic analyses. Archaea were found to have the potential to interact with plants by (i) plant growth promotion through auxin biosynthesis, (ii) nutrient supply, and (iii) protection against abiotic stress.

AB Peatlands long have been considered to preserve the record of atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic contaminants such as Pb.  In the past two decades, Pb-210 hs been widely used to date recent strata of peat and to calculate accumulation rates.  The assumption that Pb and Pb-210 are immobile and not subject to diagenesis in peat has been questioned but not rigorously tested.  We attempted to determine if Pb is mobile in peatlands and Pb profiles are altered by diagenic processes by constructing a mass balance for Pb about a small peatland, by comparing inventories, concentrations, and accumulation rates of Pb and Pb-210 in peatlands across northeastern North America, and by examining the relationship between concentrations of Pb in bog waters and peat in numerous sites.  Our results clearly demonstrate that Pb and Pb-210 are mobilized by the organic-rich waters of peatlands.  Profiles of Pb and Pb-210 at depths below the water table do not preserve the record of atmospheric deposition, and inventories fo Pb and Pb-210 are depleted in peatland hollows.  Concentrations of Pb in bog waters are regulated by the concentration of Pb in the peat and the concentration of dissolved organic carbon.  The mass balance for one bog indicated that over the specific three-year period of study more than 30% of inputs of Pb were not retained within the peat.  As a result of this mobility, dates based on Pb-210 can be biased and inaccurate by as much as 30 years.  Dates based on Pb-210 should be verified by other techniques, especially when the inventory of Pb-210 is less than that expected from local rates of deposition.

AB Hydrological changes, particularly alterations in water table level, may largely overshadow the mole direct effects of global temperature increase upon carbon cycling in arctic and subarctic wetlands. Frozen cores (n=40) of intact soils and vegetation were collected from a bog near Fairbanks, Alaska, and fluxes of CO2, CH4, and CO in response to water table variation were studied under controlled conditions in the Duke University phytotron. Core microcosms thawed to a 20-cm depth over 30 days under a 20 hour photoperiod with a day/night temperature regime of 20/10 degrees C. After 30 days the water table in 20 microcosms was decreased from the soil surface to -15 cm and maintained at the soil surface in 20 control cores. Outward fluxes of CO2 (9-16 g m(-2) d(-1)) and CO (3-4 mg m(-2) d(-1)) were greatest during early thaw and decreased to near zero for both gases before the water table treatment started. Lower water table tripled CO2 flux to the atmosphere when compared with control cores. Carbon monoxide was emitted at low rates from high water table cores and consumed by low water table cores. Methane fluxes were low (<1 mg m(-2) d(-1)) in all cores during thaw. High water table cores increased CH4 flux to 8-9 mg m(-2) d(-1) over 70 days and remained high relative to the low water table cores (<0.74 mg m(-2) d(-1)). Although drying of wetland taiga soils may decrease CH4 emissions to the atmosphere, the associated increase in CO2 due to aerobic respiration will likely increase the global warming potential of gas emissions from these soils.

AB Drained and cultivated fen peats represent some of the world's most productive soils, however, they are susceptible to degradation and typically exhibit high rates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. We hypothesised that GHG losses from these soils could be reduced by manipulating water table depth, tillage regime, crop residue application or horticultural fleece cover. Using intact soil columns from a horticultural peatland, emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4 were monitored over a six-month period, using a closed-chamber method. Concurrent measurements of soil properties allowed identification of the key controls on GHG emissions. Raising the water table to the soil surface provided the strongest reduction in global warming potential (GWP(100); 25 +/- 6 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), compared to a free-draining control (80 +/- 1 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), but this effect was partially negated by an emission pulse when the water table was subsequently lowered. The highest emissions occurred when the water table was maintained 15 cm below the surface (168 +/- 11 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), as this stimulated N2O loss. Placement of horticultural fleece over the soil surface during spring had no significant effect on GWP100, but prolonged fleece application exacerbated GHG emissions. Leaving lettuce crop residues on the surface increased soil GWP(100) (105 +/- 4 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)) in comparison to when residues were incorporated into the soil (85 +/- 4 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), however, there was no evidence that this promoted positive priming of native soil organic matter (SOM). For maximum abatement potential, mitigation measures should be applied during the growing season, when GHG emissions are greatest. Our results also suggest that introduction of zero or minimum-till practices may not reduce GHG emissions. Maintaining a high water table was the only option that reliably reduced GHG emissions, however, this option is impractical to implement within current horticultural systems. We conclude that alternative strategies or a major change in land use (e.g., conversion from horticulture/arable to wetland) should be explored as a means of preserving these soils for future generations.

AB Manual closed-chamber measurements are commonly used to quantify annual net CO2 ecosystem exchange (NEE) in a wide range of terrestrial ecosystems. However, differences in both the acquisition and gap filling of manual closed-chamber data are large in the existing literature, complicating inter-study comparisons and meta analyses. The aim of this study was to compare common approaches for quantifying CO2 exchange at three methodological levels. (1) The first level included two different CO2 flux measurement methods: one via measurements during mid-day applying net coverages (mid-day approach) and one via measurements from sunrise to noon (sunrise approach) to capture a span of light conditions for measurements of NEE with transparent chambers. (2) The second level included three different methods of pooling measured ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) fluxes for empirical modeling of R-ECO: campaign-wise (19 single-measurement-day R-ECO models), season-wise (one R-ECO model for the entire study period), and cluster-wise (two R-ECO models representing a low and a high vegetation status). (3) The third level included two different methods of deriving fluxes of gross primary production (GPP): by subtracting either proximately measured R-ECO fluxes (direct GPP modeling) or empirically modeled R-ECO fluxes from measured NEE fluxes (indirect GPP modeling). Measurements were made during 2013-2014 in a lucerne-clover-grass field in NE Germany. Across the different combinations of measurement and gap-filling options, the NEE balances of the agricultural field diverged strongly (-200 to 425gCO(2)-Cm-2). NEE balances were most similar to previous studies when derived from sunrise measurements and indirect GPP modeling. Overall, the large variation in NEE balances resulting from different data-acquisition or gap-filling strategies indicates that these methodological decisions should be made very carefully and that they likely add to the overall uncertainty of greenhouse gas emission factors. Preferably, a standard approach should be developed to reduce the uncertainty of upscaled estimates.

AB Net ecosystem CO2 exchange was measured during the 1990 growing season (June to August) along a transect starting 10 km inland from James Bay and extending 100 km interior to Kinosheo Lake, Ontario. Sites were chosen in three distinct areas: a coastal fen, an interior fen, and a bog. For the most productive sites in the bog net daily uptake rates reached a maximum of 2.5 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1) with an area-weighted exchange of 0.3 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1) near midsummer. This site was estimated to be a net carbon source of 9 g C-CO2 m(-2) to the atmosphere over a 153-day growing season. The interior fen was less productive on a daily basis with a net maximum uptake of 0.5 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1) and with corresponding area-weighted uptake of 0.1 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1) during midsummer. Early and late season release of carbon to the atmosphere resulted in a net loss of 21 g C-CO2 m(-2) over the growing season from this site. The coastal fen was the most productive site with uptake rates peaking near 1.7 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1) which corresponded to an area-weighted uptake of 0.8 g C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1) during midsummer and an estimated net uptake of 6 g C-CO2 m(-2) for the growing season. Associated with net CO2 exchange measurements, multispectral reflectance properties of the sites were measured over the growing season using portable radiometers. These properties were related to exchange rates with the goal of examining the potential for. satellite remote sensing to monitor biosphere/atmosphere CO2 exchange in this biome. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed fi om surface reflectance was correlated with net CO2 exchange for all sites with the exception of areas with large proportions of Sphagnum moss cover. These mosses have greater near-infrared reflectance than typical surrounding vegetation and may require special adjustment for regional exchange/remote sensing applications.

AB To understand the global carbon cycle and the impact of human activity on climate, it is necessary to quantify the net CO2 exchange of ecosystems in different land uses on a large scale. Methods to estimate soil net CO2 exchange (NECO2soil) for drained peatland forests have been largely based on chamber measurements and statistical models. The uncertainty in these methods has not been assessed. Yet, disturbed organic soils are a globally important, potential CO2 source due to their vast carbon storage and its sensitivity to changes in soil moisture.
   In this study, we estimated the countrywide NECO2soil for the 4.76 million ha of forestry-drained peat soils in Finland. We gathered available litter production and CO2 efflux data and constructed models to be used for the upscaling of NECO2soil from forest inventory data. The contribution of each model and the inventory sampling to the precision of the countrywide estimate was calculated. Also, the sensitivity to possible bias in selected model components was estimated.
   Compared to the estimated mean NECO2soil, ranging from a source of +20 g m(-2) year(-1) of C to a sink of -40 g m(-2) year(-1) of C, the uncertainty was high. The precision of the estimate (+/- 1 standard deviation) was +/- 20 g m(-2) year(-1) of C. Due to possible bias in the estimated belowground litter input, the overall uncertainty was much higher, around 60 g m(-2) year(-1) of C.
   The main reason for the high relative uncertainty was NECO2soil being on average close to zero in these boreal forestry-drained peatlands. Forest inventory sample size was large enough and the data for the models were mainly sufficient. To reduce the uncertainty, better understanding of belowground carbon fluxes in order to accurately determine the C input to soil, is crucial. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and Aims Sphagnum-dominated peatlands contain approx. 30 % of the terrestrial carbon pool in the form of partially decomposed plant material (peat), and, as a consequence, Sphagnum is currently a focus of studies on biogeochemistry and control of global climate. Sphagnum species differ in ecologically important traits that scale up to impact ecosystem function, and sequencing of the genome from selected Sphagnum species is currently under-way. As an emerging model system, these resources for Sphagnum will facilitate linking nucleotide variation to plant functional traits, and through those traits to ecosystem processes. A solid phylogenetic framework for Sphagnum is crucial to comparative analyses of species-specific traits, but relationships among major clades within Sphagnum have been recalcitrant to resolution because the genus underwent a rapid radiation. Herein a well-supported hypothesis for phylogenetic relationships among major clades within Sphagnum based on organellar genome sequences (plastid, mitochondrial) is provided.
   Methods We obtained nucleotide sequences (273 753 nucleotides in total) from the two organellar genomes from 38 species (including three outgroups). Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using a variety of methods applied to nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The Sphagnum phylogeny was rooted with sequences from the related Sphagnopsida genera, Eosphagnum and Flatbergium.
   Key Results Phylogenetic analyses of the data converge on the following subgeneric relationships: (Rigida (((Subsecunda) (Cuspidata)) ((Sphagnum) (Acutifolia))). All relationships were strongly supported. Species in the two major clades (i.e. Subsecunda + Cuspidata and Sphagnum + Acutifolia), which include > 90 % of all Sphagnum species, differ in ecological niches and these differences correlate with other functional traits that impact biogeochemical cycling. Mitochondrial intron presence/absence are variable among species and genera of the Sphagnopsida. Two new nomenclatural combinations are made, in the genera Eosphagnum and Flatbergium.
   Conclusions Newly resolved relationships now permit phylogenetic analyses of morphological, biochemical and ecological traits among Sphagnum species. The results clarify long-standing disagreements about subgeneric relationships and intrageneric classification.

AB Globally, peatlands provide an important sink of carbon in their near natural state but potentially act as a source of gaseous and dissolved carbon emission if not in good condition. There is a pressing need to remotely identify peatland sites requiring improvement and to monitor progress following restoration. A medium resolution model was developed based on a training dataset of peatland habitat condition and environmental covariates, such as morphological features, against information derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), covering Scotland (UK). The initial, unrestricted, model provided the probability of a site being in favourable condition. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves for restricted training data, limited to those located on a peat soil map, resulted in an accuracy of 0.915. The kappa statistic was 0.8151, suggesting good model fit. The derived map of predicted peatland condition at the suggested 0.56 threshold was corroborated by data from other sources, including known restoration sites, areas under known non-peatland land cover and previous vegetation survey data mapped onto inferred condition categories. The resulting locations of the areas of peatland modelled to be in favourable ecological condition were largely confined to the North and West of the country, which not only coincides with prior land use intensity but with published predictions of future retraction of the bioclimatic space for peatlands. The model is limited by a lack of spatially appropriate ground observations, and a lack of verification of peat depth at training site locations, hence future efforts to remotely assess peatland condition will require more appropriate ground-based monitoring. If appropriate ground-based observations could be collected, using remote sensing could be considered a cost-efficient means to provide data on changes in peatland habitat condition.

AB The effect of artificial shoot clipping on the vegetative growth and sexual reproduction of the evergreen bearberry, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, and the deciduous bog bilberry, Vaccinium uliginosum, was studied in the vicinity of a copper-nickel smelter in SW Finland. According to the research hypothesis, heavy metal induced shoot death breaks the apical dominance in the clones growing in a polluted environment. This causes activation of dormant axillary and adventitious buds and an increase in branching on the older parts of the stem. Regrowth after shoot death was studied by clipping off all the current-year shoots from experimental branches in autumn (1994) and spring (1995). Within-clone and between-clone control branches were used to test the data.
   Both species displayed a considerable ability to activate dormant meristems after the damage. Regrowth of the current shoots during the next growing season (1995) was about 80% compared to the within-clone control in both species after autumn clipping. Shoot clipping in early summer was more detrimental for both species, and the regrowth of A. uva-ursi was less than that of V. uliginosum. Differences in the storage reserves and source-sink mechanisms of carbon allocation between evergreen and deciduous species probably explain their distinct response. When the removed biomass was added to the living biomass of the branches, there was overcompensation in the total dry weight of A. uva-ursi after autumn clipping, and the weight was almost 90% of the control after spring clipping. The total dry weight of V. uliginosum also equalled that of the control when the removed biomass was added. No berries developed on either species in the year following the autumn treatment, because clipping removed all the flower buds. Spring clipping had no effect on the sexual reproduction of A. uva-ursi, but decreased the berry production of V. uliginosum. The degree of compensatory growth of both species was only slightly affected by the distance from the smelter. It is suggested that dormant bud activation, rapid regrowth and plastic branching contribute to the resistance mechanism to heavy metals.

AB [1] We report on net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) measurements conducted with the eddy covariance method over agricultural peat soil in the 2-year period between October 2000 and October 2002. In 2001, spring barley and undersown grass were sown on the site. After the barley harvest, the perennial forage grass was left to grow, so that in 2002 the field was growing grass. A higher maximum net CO2 uptake was observed for barley than for grass during the height of the summer, peaking at about -1.0 and - 0.75 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1), respectively. The maximum nighttime total ecosystem respiration was measured in July and was similar for both crops, about 0.35 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1). During the growing season the field acted as a daily CO2 sink for only 40 days in barley versus 84 days in grass. In the winter the average carbon dioxide efflux varied from 15.6 to 16.5 mug CO2 m(-2) s(-1). The annual NEE of the agricultural peat soil growing barley and grass was 771 +/- 104 and 290 +/- 91 g CO2 m(-2), respectively. The longer net CO2 uptake period was the main reason for the lower annual NEE for grass; however, owing to the higher amount of grass biomass produced the net ecosystem production (NEP), calculated as the sum of NEE and removed biomass, was slightly larger for grass (452 g C m(-2)) than for barley (336 g C m(-2)). These results show that the organic peat is still undergoing rapid decomposition after more than 100 years of cultivation activity. In addition, switching from an annual to a perennial crop did not turn the field into a CO2 sink, at least during a 1-year period.

AB This study used a long-term monitoring data to analyse the abundance, seasonal dynamics, spatial distribution and catchment export of total organic carbon (TOC) in one of the largest undisturbed peatland river catchment in Central Europe. Mean annual TOC concentrations in the Narew River basin were higher than 10-11 mg C L-1 which is similar to nemoral or Baltic rivers. The maximal monthly TOC concentrations occurred in May with a one-month delay from the spring maximum of water outflow. High TOC concentrations were accompanied by naturally increased organic nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations resulting in decreased water quality class despite the anthropogenic pressure is low. Mean annual export of TOC from the Narew River catchment amounted to 2.15 g C m(-2), which is nearly 25% higher than for the Vistula River, the recipient. TOC export form the analysed river basin in dry years was 30% lower and 50% higher in wet years than the multiannual average. The primary cause of high TOC concentrations in the Narew River catchment and high TOC export is the occurrence of biogeochemically active wetlands, functioning not only thanks to spring flooding of the valleys, but also based on permanent intensive groundwaters supply from surrounding plateaus. This emphasises the importance of basin hydrology in the regulation of carbon cycling in the temperate lowland catchments. Our results also indicate that in environmental zonation of Europe Narew River catchment should be classified as belonging to the Baltic Province (Nemoral environmental zone) rather then to Continental zone. This is because it is characterized with high riverine TOC concentrations and natural water oxygen depletion in summers. Thus, Environmental Stratification of Europe developed for environmental statistics and monitoring should be re-evaluated. Climate change is likely to affect the organic carbon circulation in peatland catchments and reduce TOC fluxes into river network.

AB Wetlands are important dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reservoirs, and principal sources of DOC to the fluvial environment, constituting a significant linkage between land and ocean in the context of global carbon cycle. The Sanjiang Plain, a floodplain in Northeastern China that encompasses numerous natural freshwater wetlands, has been experiencing extensive building of drainage ditches and thus elevated degradation of wetlands. This paper investigated DOC, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved total carbon (DTC) in soil, the surface ponding and rivers from natural wetlands and the degraded wet-land, and also in an artificial drainage ditch in the Sanjiang Plain during the growing season (May to October) of 2009. Seasonal averaged DOC concentrations were greater in soil and the surface ponding of the degraded riparian wetland than those originating from the natural riparian wetlands (i.e. Bielahong, Yalv and Nongjiang riparian wetlands). Seasonal averaged DIC concentrations in the surface ponding of the degraded wetland increased by 1.76, 0.59 and 2.05 times, compared to those in the Bielahong, Yalv and Nongjiang riparian wetlands, respectively. Similar to dissolved carbon dynamics in the field sites, the seasonal averaged DOC concentration in the degraded marshy river showed higher value (10.36 +/- 1.99 mg/L), compared to those in the pristine marshy rivers. Seasonal DIC concentrations followed a trend as the degraded marshy river (15.09 +/- 2.43 mg/L) - the artificial ditch (12.52 +/- 1.61 mg/L) - pristine marshy rivers on average (8.53 +/- 0.96 mg/L). Seasonal mean DTC concentration in the artificial ditch showed higher values than that in the natural marshy rivers, while seasonal mean DTC concentration in the degraded marshy river was greater than that in the artificial ditch. Further, seasonal DOC and DIC dynamics were similar in the artificial ditch and the degraded marshy river. These qualitative changes in the dissolved carbon dynamics in our study might have important implications that the impact of building of artificial ditches on dissolved carbon of waters more fully reflected in increases of dissolved carbon resulting from wetland degradation rather than increases in the artificial ditch itself.

AB Peatlands act as global sinks of atmospheric carbon (C) through the accumulation of organic matter(1), primarily made up of decay-resistant litter of peat mosses(2). However, climate warming has been shown to promote vascular plant growth in peatlands, especially ericaceous shrubs(3). A change in vegetation cover is in turn expected to modify above-ground/below-ground interactions(4), but the biogeochemical mechanisms involved remain unknown. Here, by selecting peatlands at different altitudes to simulate a natural gradient of soil temperature, we show that the expansion of ericaceous shrubs with warming is associated with an increase of polyphenol content in both plant litter and pore water. In turn, this retards the release of nitrogen (N) from decomposing litter, increases the amount of dissolved organic N and reduces N immobilization by soil microbes. A decrease of soil water content with increasing temperature promotes the growth of fungi, which feeds back positively on ericaceous shrubs by facilitating the symbiotic acquisition of dissolved organic N. We also observed a higher release of labile C from vascular plant roots at higher soil temperatures, which promotes the microbial investment in C-degrading enzymes. Our data suggest that climate-induced changes in plant cover can reduce the productivity of peat mosses and potentially prime the decomposition of organic matter by affecting the stoichiometry of soil enzymatic activity.

AB Background: Northern peatlands are known for having significant stocks of terrestrial soil carbon (C). However, little is known about how peatlands function under various land uses and what impacts land-use change has on their functioning in central Europe.
   Aim: The objective of our study was to quantify the variability and controls of typical plant communities in terms of C gas dynamics on bogs and fens affected by a changed hydrological regime in the Bohemian Forest, Czech Republic.
   Methods: Carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange and methane emissions (CH4) were measured in bogs (pristine, drained, restored) and in fens (pristine, drained) during the 2009 growing season. We applied cluster analysis to define plant communities and non-linear response models to quantify the variation in CO2 dynamics among the communities.
   Results: Drainage had a strong impact on vegetation; forest and meadows species were dominant on drained peatland sites and the vascular green area was higher than on pristine sites. The net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) varied from -27 to 241 g CO2-C m(-2) per growing season on the bogs and from 27 to 153 g m(-2) on the fens. The most-drained parts of the bog and fen with the most changed vegetation structure acted as both net C sources and very weak C sinks; however, areas dominated by Molinia caerulea acted as a strong C sink. Plant communities on the wetter parts of drained sites had a positive seasonal NEE, comparable with NEE on pristine sites. Seasonal CH4 emissions were relatively low (0-9 g CH4-C m(-2)) at all sites and did not influence net C balance, with the exception of pristine fen where CH4 emissions with average 90 g C m(-2) led to a negative total growing season C balance. Water regime restoration caused neither a significant change in plant composition nor any major changes, such as plant die-back or increased CH4 emissions during the first season after restoration.
   Conclusions: Our results showed that C gas fluxes, and in turn the C balance of the whole ecosystem, were largely determined by plant community type. Drainage did not necessarily lead to a negative ecosystem C balance; however, a significant change of species composition occurred on most drained areas. The less-drained parts on drained sites, where original peatland species and original functions are preserved, could facilitate future ecosystem restoration.

AB In boreal bogs plant species are low in number, but they differ greatly in their growth forms and photosynthetic properties. We assessed how ecosystem carbon (C) sink dynamics were affected by seasonal variations in the photosynthetic rate and leaf area of different species. Photosynthetic properties (light response parameters), leaf area development and areal cover (abundance) of the species were used to quantify species-specific net and gross photosynthesis rates (P-N and P-G, respectively), which were summed to express ecosystem-level P-N and P-G. The ecosystem-level P-G was compared with a gross primary production (GPP) estimate derived from eddy covariance (EC) measurements.
   Species areal cover, rather than differences in photosynthetic properties, determined the species with the highest P-G of both vascular plants and Sphagna. Species-specific contributions to the ecosystem P-G varied over the growing season, which, in turn, determined the seasonal variation in ecosystem P-G. The upscaled growing season P-G estimate, 230 gCm (-2), agreed well with the GPP estimated by the EC (243 gCm (-2)).
   Sphagna were superior to vascular plants in ecosystemlevel P-G throughout the growing season but had a lower P-N. P-N results indicated that areal cover of the species, together with their differences in photosynthetic parameters, shape the ecosystem-level C balance. Species with low areal cover but high photosynthetic efficiency appear to be potentially important for the ecosystem C sink. Results imply that func-tional diversity, i. e., the presence of plant groups with different seasonal timing and efficiency of photosynthesis, may increase the stability of C sinks of boreal bogs.

AB Northern peatlands are significant stocks of terrestrial soil carbon, and it has been predicted that warmer temperatures and lower water tables resulting from climate change will convert these ecosystems into sources for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). However, these predictions do not consider the potential for hydrologically induced ecological succession or the spatial variability of carbon accumulation rates between different microforms in peatlands. To address these issues, the vegetation community was described, and the rates of gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP), ecosystem respiration (R-tot) and net ecosystem CO2 exchange were determined along poor fen microtopographic gradients at a control site and at a site which experienced a water table drawdown of similar to 20 cm 8 years prior to the study (drained). Sampling plots within these sites were classified as microforms of hummocks, lawns, or hollows. The coverage of Sphagnum moss declined on drained hummocks, drained lawns were invaded by sedges, and hollows shifted from open water plots at the control site to Sphagnum-dominated plots with sparse vascular plant cover at the drained site. As a result, Rtot was significantly greater at the drained site at all microforms while maximum rates of GEP declined at drained hummocks and were enhanced at drained lawns and hollows compared to similar control microforms. These results suggest that predictions about the response of northern peatland carbon exchange to climate change must consider the interaction between ecology and hydrology and the differential responses of microforms related to their initial ecohydrological conditions.

These include rock weathering, plant nutrition, pH buffering, trace metal mobility and toxicity, bioavailability, degradation and transport of hydrophobic organic chemicals, formation of disinfection by-products during water treatment, heterotrophic production in blackwater ecosystems and, more generally, the global carbon cycle. Before the 1970s, natural organic matter of different ecosystem pools (i.e., soils, sediments, and natural waters) was often studied in isolation, although many similarities exist between them. This is particularly so for HS.
   In this historical context, a need appeared at the international level for bringing together environmental chemists, soil scientists, hydrologists, and geologists who were interested in HS to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas, to standardize analytical procedures and agree on definitions of HS. The International Humic Substances Society (IHSS) was founded in Denver, Colorado (USA) in 1981 with several objectives among them "to bring together scientists in the coal, soil, and water sciences with interests in humic substances" (home page of the IHSS web site: http://ihss.gatech.edu/ihss2/index.html).
   This paper presents selected pioneering works on humus in soils and sediments during the 20th century with a special focus on the links between the studies of soil HS and the formation, during early diagenesis, of the precursors of kerogens. Temporal coverage includes key contributions preceding the founding of the IHSS, and a brief history of the organization is presented. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Availability of reactive nitrogen (N-r; mainly ammonium, NH4+, and nitrate, NO3-) via precipitation and upwelling groundwater affects carbon (C) accumulation in peat deposits and biological greenhouse gas emissions. Isotope composition of Nr was studied at Wolf Swamp (WS) and The Glades (GL), two peatlands located in western Maryland (U.S.), to provide a more robust understanding of N cycling at the ecosystem level. In recent years, both sites experienced a moderate atmospheric pollution (3-9 kg of deposited N-r ha(-1) yr(-1)), and possible additional N-r inputs via groundwater contaminated by fertilizers/livestock. Sampling of living Sphagnum, vertical peat profiles, atmospheric deposition, and surface bog water was carried out on October 22-24, 2017. The delta N-15(r) signatures of vertical precipitation were negative (mass-weighted means of similar to 7.2 and similar to 8.1% at WS and GL, respectively) despite reports that NOx emitted by coal-burning power plants, a precursor of deposited nitrate, had been extremely positive (up to +26 parts per thousand). Mean delta N-15 values at both sites increased in the order: vertical precipitation < living Sphagnum< atmospheric N-2 < surface bog water < maturating peat. Intermediate delta N-15 values of living Sphagnum (similar to 1.5 parts per thousand at both sites) suggested simultaneous incorporation of isotopically light atmospheric N-r and isotopically heavy N-r from bog water in the newly formed biomass. The delta N-15 values of bulk peat increased downcore by 4.5 and 4.9 parts per thousand at WS and GL, respectively. Gradual mineralization of organic N, mainly by nitrification and denitrification, is isotopically selective, leaving behind higher delta N-15 values of bulk peat at greater peat depths. Nitrogen concentration gradients and delta N-15 trends in vertical peat profiles at these locations therefore cannot be used as an archive of past changes in pollution levels and N isotope signatures of incoming N-r.

AB Water tables in high-latitude peatlands are expected to fall because of climate change, with significant consequences for carbon cycling in these ecosystems. At present, the understanding of how climate-induced changes will affect soil microbial communities and functions in peatlands still remains controversial. In this study, we compared the potential activities of soil oxidase and hydrolytic enzymes and microbial communities at different depths in a minerotrophic peatland, part of which had been drained for many years and part of which was natural. The results showed that the microbial communities and enzyme activities differed considerably between the drained peat and the natural peat, and that the degree of change varied by depth in the profile. The soil oxidase activities and hydrolase activities (beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase and acid phosphatase) in the oxic zone (0-10 cm) were higher in the drained peat than in the natural peat, but the beta-1,4-glucosidase activities decreased in the oxic zone after drainage. Soil enzyme activities in the anoxic zone were lower in the drained peat than in the natural peat. This suggests that drainage disturbance in this peatland does not support enhanced oxidative enzyme activity as hypothesized by the "enzyme-latch" mechanism. The soil total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and bacterial, fungal, and actinomycetic PLFAs in the oxic zone were lower in the drained peat than in the natural peat. The total PLFAs and bacterial PLFAs were higher in the transitional zone of the drained peat than the natural peat, but remained similar in the anoxic zone of the drained and natural peat. The fungi/bacteria and gram-positive/gram-negative ratios were lower in the drained peat than in the natural peat. The soil bacterial communities was strongly and positively linked with the beta-1,4-glucosidase activities involved in carbon transformation, whereas the fungi was positively associated with oxidase activities driving carbon oxidation. We found that these variations in the microbial communities and enzyme activities were associated with differences in the litter quality, soil organic carbon, soil moisture content, and the pH between the drained peat and natural peat. These observations indicate a modification in microbial communities and their activities reflective of changing peat C cycling. The observed reduction in microbial biomass with peatland drainage appears to have also resulted in reductions in enzyme activity suggesting potential limits to the 'enzyme-latch' mechanism for peatland C loss following longer-term drainage.

AB Northern boreal forests are characterized by accumulation of accumulation of peat (e.g., known as paludification). The functioning of northern boreal forest species and their capacity to adapt to environmental changes appear to depend on soil conditions. Climate warming is expected to have particularly pronounced effects on paludified boreal ecosystems and can alter current forest species composition and adaptation by changing soil conditions such as moisture, temperature regimes, and soil respiration. In this paper, we review and synthesize results from various reported studies (i.e., 88 research articles cited hereafter) to assess the effects of climatic warming on soil conditions of paludified forests in North America. Predictions that global warming may increase the decomposition rate must be considered in combination with its impact on soil moisture, which appears to be a limiting factor. Local adaptation or acclimation to current climatic conditions is occurring in boreal forests, which is likely to be important for continued ecosystem stability in the context of climate change. The most commonly cited response of boreal forest species to global warming is a northward migration that tracks the climate and soil conditions (e.g., temperature and moisture) to which they are adapted. Yet, some constraints may influence this kind of adaptation, such as water availability, changes in fire regimes, decomposer adaptations, and the dynamic of peat accumulation. In this paper, as a study case, we examined an example of potential effects of climatic warming on future paludification changes in the eastern lowland region of Canada through three different combined hypothetical scenarios based on temperature and precipitation (e.g., unchanged, increase, or decrease). An increase scenario in precipitation will likely favor peat accumulation in boreal forest stands prone to paludification and facilitate forested peatland expansion into upland forest, while decreased or unchanged precipitation combined with an increase in temperature will probably favor succession of forested peatlands to upland boreal forests. Each of the three scenarios were discussed in this study, and consequent silvicultural treatment options were suggested for each scenario to cope with anticipated soil and species changes in the boreal forests. We concluded that, despite the fact boreal soils will not constrain adaptation of boreal forests, some consequences of climatic warming may reduce the ability of certain species to respond to natural disturbances such as pest and disease outbreaks, and extreme weather events.

AB The humification process is one of the least understood and most intriguing aspects of humus chemistry and vital to the global carbon (C) cycle. Peatlands represent the largest terrestrial reservoirs of organic C and support a unique biodiversity, but are also natural archives of climate and environmental changes. In fact, cores from ombrotrophic peatlands are commonly used to reconstruct environmental impacts by human activities during the past decades, centuries and millennia. Understanding the extent to which bogs may serve as reliable archives is of paramount importance in order to ensure that chronological information about natural and human-induced environmental changes are effectively preserved in peat deposits rather than irretrievably affected by humification. Structural changes of the organic matter which constitutes peat are often evaluated by various indirect measures of the degree of humification. Numerous methods and proxies have been proposed and used during the last century, often providing contrasting or inconsistent results. Here, we tested multiple physical, chemical, spectroscopic and thermal approaches using peat samples collected from nine bogs on four continents. Despite the different climatic conditions, botanical composition, depth and age of peat formation, we show that the H/C ratio is the simplest, most widely valid and cost-effective humification proxy and should find universal application to multi-proxy geochemical and paleoenvironmental studies. Moreover, we show that, on average, threequarters of the organic C in the studied bogs is in a comparatively undecomposed state, and thus vulnerable to climate changes.

AB Peatland vegetation is controlled primarily by the depth of the water table, making peat paleovegetation a useful climate archive. We applied a biochemical approach to quantitatively estimate the plant sources of peat carbon based on (1) neutral sugar compositions of Sphagnum, vascular plants, and lichens and (2) lignin phenol compositions of vascular plants. We used these biochemical indices to characterize vegetation change over the last 2000years in four peat cores from the West Siberian Lowland (Russia) to investigate climate change during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and Little Ice Age. The vegetation was dominated by Sphagnum in all four cores, but was punctuated by several rapid but transient transitions to vascular plant dominance in the two cores from the southern West Siberian Lowland (<60 degrees N latitude). Lichen contributions were evident at the end of the Medieval Climate Anomaly and during the Little Ice Age in the two cores from northern West Siberian Lowland (>60 degrees N), possibly indicating permafrost development. However, there was no evidence for sustained vegetation change in response to either climatic event in cores from southern West Siberian Lowland. This suggests that these climatic events were relatively mild in the southern West Siberian Lowland, although the sensitivity of bog plant communities to climate change remains poorly understood.

Carbon accumulation depends on the ratio between net primary production and decomposition, both of which can change under projected increases of atmospheric CO2 and N deposition. The decomposition of litter is influenced by 1) the quality of the litter, and 2) the microenvironmental conditions in which the litter decomposes. This study aims at experimentally testing the effects of these two drivers in the context of global change. We studied the in situ litter decomposition from three common peatland species (Eriophorum vaginatum, Polytrichum strictum and Sphagnum fallax) collected after one year of litter production under pre-treatment conditions (elevated CO2: 560 ppm or enhanced N: 3 g m(-2) y(-1) NH4NO3) and decomposed the following year under treatment conditions (same as pre-treatment). By considering the cross-effects between pre-treatments and treatments, we distinguished between the effects on mass loss of 1) the pre-treatment-induced litter quality and 2) the treatment conditions under which the litters were decomposing. The combination between CO2 pre-treatment and CO2 treatment reduced Polytrichum decomposition by 24% and this can be explained by litter quality-driven decomposition changes brought by the pre-treatment. CO2 pre-treatment reduced Eriophorum litter quality, although this was not sufficient to predict decomposition. The N addition pretreatment reduced the decomposition of Eriophorum, due to enhanced lignin and soluble phenols concentrations in the initial litter, and reduced litter-driven losses of starch and enhanced litter-driven losses of soluble phenols. While decomposition indices based on initial litter quality provide a broad explanation of quantitative and qualitative decomposition, they can only be taken as first approximations. Indeed, the microbial ATP activity, the litter N loss and resulting litter quality, were strongly altered irrespective of the compounds' initial concentration and by means of processes that occurred independently of the initial litter-qualitative changes. The experimental design was valuable to assess litter- and ecosystem-driven decomposition pathways simultaneously or independently. The ability to separate these two drivers makes it possible to attest the presence of litter-qualitative changes even without any litter biochemical determinations, and shows the screening potential of this approach for future experiments dealing with multiple plant species.

AB Given the magnitude of soil carbon stocks in northern ecosystems, and the vulnerability of these stocks to climate warming, land surface models must accurately represent soil carbon dynamics in these regions. We evaluate soil carbon stocks and turnover rates, and the relationship between soil carbon loss with soil temperature and moisture, from an ensemble of eleven global land surface models. We focus on the region of NASA's Arctic-Boreal vulnerability experiment (ABoVE) in North America to inform data collection and model development efforts. Models exhibit an order of magnitude difference in estimates of current total soil carbon stocks, generally under- or overestimating the size of current soil carbon stocks by greater than 50 PgC. We find that a model's soil carbon stock at steady-state in 1901 is the prime driver of its soil carbon stock a hundred years later-overwhelming the effect of environmental forcing factors like climate. The greatest divergence between modeled and observed soil carbon stocks is in regions dominated by peat and permafrost soils, suggesting that models are failing to capture the frozen soil carbon dynamics of permafrost regions. Using a set of functional benchmarks to test the simulated relationship of soil respiration to both soil temperature and moisture, we find that although models capture the observed shape of the soil moisture response of respiration, almost half of the models examined show temperature sensitivities, or Q10 values, that are half of observed. Significantly, models that perform better against observational constraints of respiration or carbon stock size do not necessarily perform well in terms of their functional response to key climatic factors like changing temperature. This suggests that models may be arriving at the right result, but for the wrong reason. The results of this work can help to bridge the gap between data and models by both pointing to the need to constrain initial carbon pool sizes, as well as highlighting the importance of incorporating functional benchmarks into ongoing, mechanistic modeling activities such as those included in ABoVE.

AB Several explanations have been proposed to account for the dramatic perturbation to Earth's carbon cycle that led to extreme warming, ocean acidification, mass extinction, and a major negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) at the Paleocene-Eocene (P/E) boundary. One reason that the ultimate cause for this event remains ambiguous is the difficulty in directly testing these multiple hypotheses. We conducted a test of one proposed mechanism, the "wildfire hypothesis," that suggests that combustion of a significant fraction of abundant Paleocene peat deposits within several thousand years could release enough CO2 to Earth's atmosphere to account for all of these observations. Soot and graphitic black carbon (hereafter collectively referred to as GBC), both combustion byproducts, are widely distributed (through smoke) by subaerial combustion, and are remarkably resistant to diagenetic degradation. Using samples provided by the Ocean Drilling Program, we measured GBC concentrations across the P/E boundary in two important Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) sections to test a prediction of the wildfire hypothesis, namely that the combustion of Paleocene organic matter at the onset of the PETM would produce a peak in sedimentary GBC. In the Bass River section (New Jersey margin), GBC concentrations are uniformly high (121-358 ppm), consistent with the core's continental margin setting, but there is no evidence of increased GBC flux at the PETM. Furthermore, carbon isotopic ratios of GBC display the negative CIE seen in PETM organic matter, indicating that this material was sourced from contemporaneous (P/E boundary) biomass, not geologically old carbon. At site 1210 (Shatsky Rise), GBC concentrations were uniformly below our method's detection limit (0.5 ppm), whereas the wildfire hypothesis would predict high GBC concentrations (similar to 3000) ppm accompanying the event. Together, these data appear to refute but cannot conclusively rule out biomass burning as the cause for the PETM event. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands are important sinks for atmospheric carbon (C), yet the role of plant functional types (PFTs) for C sequestration under climatic perturbations is still unclear. A plant-removal experiment was used to study the importance of vascular PFTs for the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) during (i.e., resistance) and after (i.e., recovery) an experimental drought. The removal of PFTs caused a decrease of NEE, but the rate differed between microhabitats (i.e., hummocks and lawns) and the type of PFTs. Ericoid removal had a large effect on NEE in hummocks, while the graminoids played a major role in the lawns. The removal of PFTs did not affect the resistance or the recovery after the experimental drought. We argue that the response of Sphagnum mosses (the only PFT present in all treatments) to drought is dominant over that of coexisting PFTs. However, we observed that the moment in time when the system switched from C sink to C source during the drought was controlled by the vascular PFTs. In the light of climate change, the shifts in species composition or even the loss of certain PFTs are expected to strongly affect the future C dynamics in response to environmental stress.

AB Tropical epiphytic plants within the family Bromeliaceae are unusual in that they possess foliage capable of retaining water and impounded material. This creates an acidic (pH 3.5 6.5) and anaerobic (<1 ppm O-2) environment suspended in the canopy. Results from a Costa Rican rainforest show that most bromeliads (n = 75/86) greater than similar to 20 cm in plant height or similar to 4-5 cm tank depth, showed presence of methanogens within the lower anoxic horizon of the tank. Archaea were dominated by methanogens (77-90% of recovered ribotypes) and community structure, although variable, was generally comprised of a single type, closely related to either hydrogenotrophic Methanoregula or Methanocella, a specific clade of aceticlastic Methanosaeta, or Methanosarcina. Juvenile bromeliads, or those species, such as Guzmania, with shallow tanks, generally did not possess methanogens, as assayed by polymerase chain reaction specific for methanogen 16S rRNA genes, nor did artificial catchments (similar to 100 ml volume), in place 6-12 months prior to sample collection. Methanogens were not detected in soil (n = 20), except in one case, in which the dominant ribotype was different from nearby bromeliads. Recovery of methyl coenzyme M reductase genes supported the occurrence of hydrogenotrophic and aceticlastic methanogens within bromeliad tanks, as well as the trend, via QPCR analysis of mcrA, of increased methanogenic capacity with increased plant height. Methane production rates of up to 300 nmol CH4 ml tank water(-1) day(-1) were measured in microcosm experiments. These results suggest that bromeliad-associated archaeal communities may play an important role in the cycling of carbon in neotropical forests.

AB An unprecedented collection of 2161 geolocated, irregularly spaced field observations of land cover spanning similar to 10(6) km(2) throughout West Siberia suggests that currently available land cover classification products are remarkably poor indicators of vegetation type and water body extent in this northern wetland environment. The ground-truth data are compared with (1) the Global Land Cover Characteristics database derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data (GLCC.AVHRR), (2) the Global Land Cover Classification derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data (GLCC.MODIS), (3) the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD), and (4) the West Siberian Lowland Peatland Database (WSLPD) using: (1) all land cover categories and (2) permanent wetland and water body categories only. Overall agreement with ground observations of land cover is only 21% for the GLCC.AVHRR database and 11% for the GLCC.MODIS database. However, at a much broader scale (one degree of latitude) there is improved qualitative agreement between vegetation classes, with some notable exceptions: (1) at low latitudes (similar to 54 degrees N-58 degrees N), both the GLCC.AVHRR and GLCC.MODIS databases underestimate woody savannas in favor of croplands; (2) at midlatitudes (similar to 58 degrees N-64 degrees N), the GLCC.AVHRR database underestimates evergreen needleleaf forest in favor of mixed forest; and (3) at high latitudes (similar to 64 degrees N-68 degrees N), both the GLCC.AVHRR and GLCC.MODIS databases underestimate deciduous needleleaf forest in favor of woody savannas or open shrublands, respectively. It is clear that all four data databases significantly underestimate permanent wetlands and water bodies, although those specifically developed for this purpose (GLWD and WSPLD) perform better than the more widely used, multiclass land cover products. For permanent wetlands, agreement with our ground data is only 2% for GLCC.MODIS, 23% for GLCC.AVHRR, 45% for GLWD and 56% for WSLPD. Agreement with open water bodies is even poorer (0-5%). These results raise into question the efficacy of incorporating currently available land cover products into terrestrial ecosystem models in northern wetland environments.

AB Ombrotrophic bog peatlands are nutrient-deficient systems and important carbon (C) sinks yet the stoichiometry of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), essential for plant growth and decomposition, has rarely been studied. We investigated the seasonal variation in C, N, P, and K concentrations and their stoichiometric ratios in photosynthetically active tissues of 14 species belonging to five plant functional types (PFTs) (mosses, deciduous trees/shrubs, evergreen shrubs, graminoids, and forb) at Mer Bleue bog, an ombrotrophic peatland in eastern Ontario, Canada. Although we observed variations in stoichiometry among PFTs at peak growing season, there was convergence of C:N:P:K to an average mass ratio of 445:14:1:9, indicating N and P co-limitation. Nitrogen, P, and K concentrations and stoichiometric ratios showed little seasonal variation in mosses, evergreens, and graminoids, but in forb and deciduous species were the largest in spring and decreased throughout the growing season. Variations in nutrient concentrations and stoichiometric ratios among PFTs were greater than seasonal variation within PFTs. Plants exhibit N and P co-limitation and adapt to extremely low nutrient availability by maintaining small nutrient concentrations in photosynthetically active tissues, especially for evergreen shrubs and Sphagnum mosses. Despite strong seasonal variations in nutrient availabilities, few species show strong seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations, suggesting a strong stoichiometric homeostasis at Mer Bleue bog.

AB Regional-scale soil organic carbon (SOC) field investigations would significantly improve our understanding of national and global SOC sequestration and carbon (C) cycles. The Zoige wetland is the world's largest high-altitude wetland. It is located in northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Although considered sensitive to global climate change, little is known of its wetland SOC stocks and spatial distribution patterns. Accordingly, we investigated SOC stocks and spatial distribution patterns in the uppermost 1 m soil layer in Ruoergai and Hongyuan counties in the Zoige wetland. We found that SOC decreased with increasing soil depth, which was highest in the topmost 0.3 m soil layer. Total nitrogen and water content were positively correlated to SOC content while bulk density was negatively correlated to SOC content in both wetland and grassland areas. Wetlands had a higher SOC density than grassland. In the uppermost 1 m of wetland soil, average SOC density, was 69.5 kg C m(-3), greater by a factor of three compared to mean wetland SOC density in China and greater by a factor of six compared to the national average. SOC stock in the uppermost 1 m of wetland, soils totaled 514 Tg C, of which 50% was stored in the topmost 03 m. This indicated that the two counties in the Zoige wetland stores from 8.3 to 102% of the total SOC in China in the topmost 1 m of wetland soils. This vast SOC pool and high SOC density requires sound land use practices to sustain and protect Zoige wetland ecosystem services and C stocks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bacterial mineralization of allochthonous (soil) dissolved organic matter (DOM) in boreal waters governs the CO2 flux from the lakes and rivers to the atmosphere, which is one of the main factor of carbon balance in high latitudes. However, the fate of colloidal trace element (TE) during bacterial processing of DOM remains poorly constrained. We separated monoculture of Pseudomonas saponiphila from a boreal creek and allowed it to react with boreal Fe-rich peat leachate of approximate colloidal (3 kDa-0.45 mu m) composition C1000Fe12Al3.3Mg2Ca3.7P1.2Mn0.1Ba0.5 in nutrient-free media. The total net decrease of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) concentration over 4 day of exposure was within 5% of the initial value, whereas the low molecular weight fraction of C-org (LMW< 3 kDa) yielded a 16%-decrease due to long-term bio-uptake or coagulation. There was a relative depletion in Fe over C-org of 0.45 mu m, colloidal and LMW fraction in the course of peat leachate interaction with P. saponiphila. Al, Mn, Ni, Cu, Ga, REEs, Y, U were mostly affected by bacterial presence and exhibited essentially the adsorption at the cell surface over first hours of reaction, in contrast to Fe, Ti, Zr, and Nb that showed both short-term adsorption and long-term removal by physical coagulation/coprecipitation with Fe hydroxide. The low molecular weight fraction (LMW< 3 kDa) of most TE was a factor of 2-5 less affected by microbial presence via adsorption or removal than the high molecular weight (HMW) colloidal fractions (< 0.45 mu m and < 50 kDa). The climate change-induced acceleration of heterotrophic bacterial activity in boreal and subarctic waters may lead to preferential removal of Fe over DOC from conventionally dissolved fraction and the decrease of the proportion of LMW < 3 kDa fraction and the increase of HMW colloids. Enhanced heterotrophic mineralization of organo-ferric colloids under climate warming scenario may compensate for on-going ''browning" of surface waters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Plant community composition is recognized more and more for playing an important role in ecosystem processes, such as C cycling. In particular, plant functional type (PFT) composition seems to have a key regulatory role, yet the underlying mechanisms in the interaction between PFTs and ecosystem processes are still to be identified.
   2. Here, we assess the link between PFTs and dominant microbial consumers along a calcareous poor to extremely rich fen gradient in western Poland. We particularly focussed on dominant microbial consumers (testate amoebae), which can exert large effects on the functioning of peatlands. Using moving-window analyses and path-relation networks subjected to structural equation modelling (SEM), we investigated linkages among abiotic factors, PFTs and testate amoebae.
   3. We show that along the poor to extremely rich fen gradient, the dependence of testate amoebae to PFTs is higher than their dependence to abiotic factors. We also found that the link between testate amoebae and PFTs differs between size assemblages of testate amoebae. While large testate amoeba species (i.e. high trophic level) were highly linked to Sphagnum mosses cover, small species (i.e. low trophic level) were linked to brown mosses. Distinction between shallow-rooted and deep-rooted vascular plants also showed that shallow-rooted plants play a role on testate amoeba community structure at the 'poor' side of the gradient.
   4. Our results further show a dominant role for calcium content and the structure of the bryophyte community on testate amoeba size assemblages at the poor to extremely rich fen scale, both for diversity and abundance of testate amoebae.
   5. Synthesis. Variations in plant functional type composition drive niche-size-structure of testate amoebae along the (calcareous) poor to extremely rich fen gradient. Furthermore, strong relationships between moss types and testate amoeba size-structure suggest that mosses specifically influence testate amoeba development through autogenic effects. Therefore, moss cover composition is key to microbial consumers and may be the driving factor determining microbial network structure and associated ecosystem processes, such as carbon cycling.

AB Northern peatlands store approximately one-third of the terrestrial soil carbon (C), although they cover only 3% of the global land mass. Northern peatlands can be subdivided into bogs and fens based on their hydrology and biogeochemistry. Peat/and hydrology and biogeochemistry are tightly coupled to climate and, therefore, may be very sensitive to climate variability and change. To address the fate of the large peatland soil C storage under a future changed climate, a peatland C model, the McGill Wetland Model (MWM), was coupled to a land surface climate model (the wetland version of the Canadian Land Surface Scheme, CL4SS3W), referred as CLASS3W-MWM. We evaluated the CL4SS3W-MWM for a bog (Mer Bleue, located at 45.41 degrees N, 75.48 degrees W, in eastern Canada) and a poor fen (Degero Stormyr, located at 64 degrees 11'N, 19 degrees 33'E, in northern Sweden).
   CLASS3W-MWM captured the magnitude and direction of the present day C cycling very well for both bogs and fens. Moreover, the seasonal and interannual variability were reproduced reasonably well. Root mean square errors (RMSE) were <0.65 and the degree of agreements (d*) were >0.8 for the components of net ecosystem production (NEP) for both the Mer Bleue bog and the Degero Stormyr fen. The performance of the coupled model for both bog and fen is similar to that of the stand-alone MWM driven by observed weather rather than simulated surface and soil climate. This modelling study suggests that northern peatlands are hydrologically and thermally conservative ecosystems. It was also shown that C cycling for bogs and fens was more sensitive to changes in air temperature than precipitation. Changes in temperature within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected range switch the peatlands from a present-day C sink to a source, but projected changes in precipitation still maintain the peatlands as a C sink, although to a somewhat lesser degree. Increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration enhances C sequestration for both bogs and fens. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that northern peatlands respond to changes in temperature, precipitation and doubled CO2 concentration in a highly non-linear way. The sensitivity of C cycling in northern peatlands with respect to changes in air temperature, precipitation and the concentration of atmospheric CO2 together is not a simple addition or subtraction of the sensitivity of the individual changes. Therefore, the sensitivity of a combination of changes in temperature, precipitation and doubled CO2 concentration is very different from the sensitivity of peatlands to each environmental variable on their own. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that fens have a narrower tolerance to climate changes than bogs.

AB Boreal forest fires are an important source of terrestrial carbon emissions, particularly during years of widespread wildfires. Most carbon emission models parameterize wildfire impacts and carbon flux to area burned by fires, therein making the assumption that fires consume a spatiotemporally homogeneous landscape composed of predominantly spruce forests and peat bogs with deep duff layers. While recent efforts have demonstrated that boreal forest fires heterogeneously consume aboveground vegetation, little remains known about the vegetation consumed during such fires. We examined climate, land cover, area burned, and fire impacts for large fires (2002 to 2009) across the Alaskan boreal landscape to address the validity of assumptions made by carbon emissions models for boreal fires. Results indicated that while coniferous vegetation, particularly spruce forests and spruce bogs, comprised the majority of the area burned in all years, shrub land cover comprised a substantial proportion (up to 35%) of the area burned during warmer years of the study period. Interannual climate variability significantly influenced both the proportion of vegetation classes burned and the distribution of fire impacts across years and vegetation classes. We found that surface fuel modifications were sensitive to both the vegetation type that burned and climatic conditions. Area burned is an inadequate input metric for increasingly refined carbon emissions models, and consideration of heterogeneous fire impacts may improve carbon emissions modeling.

AB Drainage turns peatlands from natural carbon sinks into hotspots of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from soils due to alterations in hydrological and biogeochemical processes. As a consequence of drainage-induced mineralisation and anthropogenic sand addition, large areas of former peatlands under agricultural use have soil organic carbon (SOC) contents at the boundary between mineral and organic soils. Previous research has shown that the variability of GHG emissions increases with anthropogenic disturbance. However, how and whether sand addition affects GHG emissions remains a controversial issue. The aim of this long-term incubation experiment was to assess the influence of hydrological and biogeochemical soil properties on emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Strongly degraded peat with sand addition (peat-sand mixtures) and without sand addition (earthified peat) was systematically compared under different moisture conditions for fen and bog peat. Soil columns originating from both the topsoil and the subsoil of ten different peatlands under grassland use were investigated. Over a period of six months the almost saturated soil columns were drained stepwise via suction to -300 hPa. The CO2 fluxes were lowest at water-saturated and dry soil moisture conditions, resulting in a parabolic dependence of CO2 fluxes on the water-filled pore space (WFPS) peaking at 56-92% WFPS. The highest N2O fluxes were found at between 73 and 95% WFPS. Maximum CO2 fluxes were highest from topsoils, ranging from 21 to 77 mg C m(-2) h(-1), while the maximum CO2 fluxes from subsoils ranged from 3 to 14 mg C m(-2) h(-1). No systematic influence of peat type or sand addition on GHG emissions was found in topsoils, but CO2 fluxes from subsoils below peat-sand mixtures were higher than from subsoils below earthified peat. Maximum N2O fluxes were highly variable between sites and ranged from 18.5 to 234.9 and from 0.2 to 22.9 mu g N m-2 h-1 for topsoils and subsoils, respectively. CH4 fluxes were negligible even under water-saturated conditions. The highest GHG emissions occurred at a WFPS that relates - under equilibrium conditions - to a water table of 20-60 cm below the surface in the field. High maximum CO2 and N2O fluxes were linked to high densities of plant-available phosphorus and potassium. The results of this study highlight that nutrient status plays a more important role in GHG emissions than peat type or sand addition, and do not support the idea of peat-sand mixtures as a mitigation option for GHG emissions.

TI Soil carbon stocks and their rates of accumulation and loss in a boreal

SO GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES

ID ATMOSPHERIC CO2; BALANCE; PEATLANDS; BOG
AB Boreal forests and wetlands are thought to be significant carbon sinks, and they could become net C sources as the Earth warms. Most of the C of boreal forest ecosystems is stored in the moss layer and in the soil. The objective of this study was to estimate soil C stocks (including moss layers) and rates of accumulation and loss for a 733 km(2) area of the BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study site in northern Manitoba, using data from smaller-scale intensive field studies. A simple process-based model developed from measurements of soil C inventories and radiocarbon was used to relate soil C storage and dynamics to soil drainage and forest stand age. Soil C stocks covary with soil drainage class, with the largest C stocks occurring in poorly drained sites. Estimated rates of soil C accumulation or loss are sensitive to the estimated decomposition constants for the large pool of deep soil C, and improved understanding of deep soil C decomposition is needed. While the upper moss layers regrow and accumulate C after fires, the deep C dynamics vary across the landscape, from a small net sink to a significant source. Estimated net soil C accumulation, averaged for the entire 733 km(2) area, was 20 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (28 g C m(-2) yr(-1) accumulation in surface mosses offset by 8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) lost from deep C pools) in a year with no fire. Most of the C accumulated in poorly and very poorly drained soils (peatlands and wetlands). Burning of the moss layer in only 1% of uplands would offset the C stored in the remaining 99% of the area. Significant interannual variability in C storage is expected because of the irregular occurrence of fire in space and time. The effects of climate change and management on fire frequency and on decomposition of immense deep soil C stocks are key to understanding future C budgets in boreal forests.

AB Ombrotrophic bogs are nutrient-poor systems and important carbon (C) sinks yet there remains a dearth of information on the belowground stoichiometry of C, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), important determinants of substrate quality for microorganisms, in these systems. In this study, we quantified the C, N, P, and K concentrations of both hummock peat and dissolved matter as well as microbial extracellular enzyme activity from 0 to 10 cm depth in the long-term NPK fertilization plots at Mer Bleue bog. Greater N-loading resulted in significantly reduced C:N and greater C:P and C:K (p < 0.05) while the addition of NPK resulted in significantly lower C:P and C:K (p < 0.05) and lower C:N relative to N-only treatments but the difference in C:N was not significant (p > 0.05). Hydrolase enzyme activity followed resource allocation models with significantly suppressed N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and phosphatase activity (p < 0.05) and enhanced beta-d-glucosidase activity with greater N- and P-availability. The concentration of inhibitory phenolics was significantly greater with N-loading (p < 0.05), due in part to shifts in surface vegetation, while phenol oxidase activity was significantly suppressed by N (p < 0.05) with results suggesting greater suppression by NH4 (+) than NO3 (-). Taken together, these results suggest that higher levels of nutrients impact both microbial substrate quality as well as the activity of microbial enzymes that are key to the decomposition process that may ultimately decrease carbon sequestration in bogs.

AB Soil temperature is a major factor affecting organic matter decomposition and thus, global warming may accelerate decomposition processes. However, it remains unclear whether the effects will be similar in climatically different regions. The effects of soil temperatures of 5, 10 and 15 degrees C on the decomposition of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needles were assessed in a 1-year (360 days) growth chamber experiment. Intact peat cores from two climatically different peatland sites (southern and northern Finland) were used as the incubation environments. Needles were incubated in litter bags beneath the living moss layer, and mass loss and nitrogen (N) concentration were determined at 60-day intervals. The rate of mass loss from the needles over time was clearly lower in the 5 degrees C treatment than at the higher temperatures. Mass loss was strongly related to the accumulated soil temperature sum. In temperatures higher than 5 degrees C, mass losses were higher in the northern peat. Also, the limit value of decomposition (asymptotic maximum mass loss) was slightly higher in the northern peat (92%), than in the southern peat (87%). The N concentration increased up to a mass loss of 50-60%, whereupon it decreased, while the amount of N (as a percentage of the original amount) remained unchanged until a mass loss of 50-60%, whereupon it decreased linearly. It seems that increasing soil temperatures may result in slightly higher rates of needle litter mass loss and consequent N release in northern peat than in southern peat. The faster decomposition in higher temperatures in the northern peat, together with the slightly higher maximum mass loss value, imply that with climatic warming, susceptibility of boreal peatlands for becoming sources of carbon to the atmosphere may increase towards north.

AB Vascular plant responses to experimental enrichment with atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), using MINIFACE technology, were studied in a Dutch lowland peatland dominated by Sphagnum and Phragmites for 3 years. We hypothesized that vascular plant carbon would accumulate in this peatland in response to CO2 enrichment owing to increased productivity of the predominant species and poorer quality (higher C/N ratios) and consequently lower decomposability of the leaf litter of these species. Carbon isotope signatures demonstrated that the extra 180 ppmv CO2 in enriched plots had been incorporated into vegetation biomass accordingly. However, on the CO2 sequestration side of the ecosystem carbon budget, there were neither any significant responses of total aboveground abundance of vascular plants, nor of any of the individual species. On the CO2 release side of the carbon budget (decomposition pathway), litter quantity did not differ between ambient and CO2 treatments, while the changes in litter quality (N and P concentration, C/N and C/P ratio) were marginal and inconsistent. It appeared therefore that the afterlife effects of significant CO2-induced changes in green-leaf chemistry (lower N and P concentrations, higher C/N and C/P) were partly offset by greater resorption of mobile carbohydrates from green leaves during senescence in CO2-enriched plants. The decomposability of leaf litters of three predominant species from ambient and CO2-enriched plots, as measured in a laboratory litter respiration assay, showed no differences. The relatively short time period, environmental spatial heterogeneity and small plot sizes might explain part of the lack of CO2 response. When our results are combined with those from other Sphagnum peatland studies, the common pattern emerges that the vascular vegetation in these ecosystems is genuinely resistant to CO2-induced change. On decadal time-scales, water management and its effects on peatland hydrology, N deposition from anthropogenic sources and land management regimes that arrest the early successional phase (mowing, tree and shrub removal), may have a greater impact on the vascular plant species composition, carbon balance and functioning of lowland Sphagnum-Phragmites reedlands than increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere.

AB Estimates of the seasonal and interannual exchanges of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) between land ecosystems north of 45 degrees N and the atmosphere are poorly constrained, in part, because of uncertainty in the temporal variability of water-inundated land area. Here we apply a process-based biogeochemistry model to evaluate how interannual changes in wetland inundation extent might have influenced the overall carbon dynamics of the region during the time period 1993-2004. We find that consideration by our model of these interannual variations between 1993 and 2004, on average, results in regional estimates of net methane sources of 67.8 +/- 6.2 Tg CH4 yr(-1), which is intermediate to model estimates that use two static inundation extent datasets (51.3 +/- 2.6 and 73.0 +/- 3.6 Tg CH4 yr(-1)). In contrast, consideration of interannual changes of wetland inundation extent result in regional estimates of the net CO2 sink of -1.28 +/- 0.03 Pg C yr(-1) with a persistent wetland carbon sink from -0.38 to -0.41 Pg C yr(-1) and a upland sink from -0.82 to -0.98 Pg C yr(-1). Taken together, despite the large methane emissions from wetlands, the region is a consistent greenhouse gas sink per global warming potential (GWP) calculations irrespective of the type of wetland datasets being used. However, the use of satellite-detected wetland inundation extent estimates a smaller regional GWP sink than that estimated using static wetland datasets. Our sensitivity analysis indicates that if wetland inundation extent increases or decreases by 10% in each wetland grid cell, the regional source of methane increases 13% or decreases 12%, respectively. In contrast, the regional CO2 sink responds with only 7-9% changes to the changes in wetland inundation extent. Seasonally, the inundated area changes result in higher summer CH4 emissions, but lower summer CO2 sinks, leading to lower summer negative greenhouse gas forcing. Our analysis further indicates that wetlands play a disproportionally important role in affecting regional greenhouse gas budgets given that they only occupy approximately 10% of the total land area in the region.

AB Concentrations and fluxes of particulate, dissolved and gaseous forms of hydrologic carbon were measured in two contrasting acidic upland streams in NE Scotland and Mid-Wales. Sampling was undertaken at the outlet of each catchment, on a weekly or biweekly basis over 2 years. In addition, spatial variations in concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC). dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), free CO2 and CH4 are presented for both streams along 14 contiguous sites between the source and the outlet of each catchment. Concentrations of carbon determinants along each stream reflected increasing inputs of TOC and gaseous forms of carbon from soil-pore water emanating from deep peat areas; these concentrations subsequently decreased downstream due to changing soil characteristics and in-stream processes.
   The total annual carbon flux was 191 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) from the NE Scotland site compared to 121 kg C ha(1) yr(1) from the Mid-Wales stream, mainly due to significantly higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (p < 0.001) found in the Scottish stream. DOC dominated the carbon flux at both the NE Scotland (88.4%) and Mid-Wales (69.0%) sites, reflecting the importance of organic carbon sources in both catchments. Particulate organic carbon ( 18.5 and 27.4 kg C ha(1) yr(-1) for NE Scotland and Mid-Wales, respectively), HCO3--C (1.12 and 1.28 kg C ha(1) yr(1)) and free CO2-C (2.62 and 8.75 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) also contributed to the overall carbon flux. The CH4-C flux at the outlet of each catchment was less than 0.01 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Climatic differences between the two sites were expressed in terms of significantly higher discharge and temperature, which caused an increase in CO2 and CH4 export from the warmer and wetter Mid-Wales catchment.

TI A new data set for estimating organic carbon storage to 3m depth in

SO EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA

DT Article; Data Paper
ID SIBERIAN PEATLANDS; VULNERABILITY; SENSITIVITY; CYCLE
AB High-latitude terrestrial ecosystems are key components in the global carbon cycle. The Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD) was developed to quantify stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the northern circumpolar permafrost region (a total area of 18.7 x 10(6) km(2)). The NCSCD is a geographical information system (GIS) data set that has been constructed using harmonized regional soil classification maps together with pedon data from the northern permafrost region. Previously, the NCSCD has been used to calculate SOC storage to the reference depths 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm (based on 1778 pedons). It has been shown that soils of the northern circumpolar permafrost region also contain significant quantities of SOC in the 100-300 cm depth range, but there has been no circumpolar compilation of pedon data to quantify this deeper SOC pool and there are no spatially distributed estimates of SOC storage below 100 cm depth in this region. Here we describe the synthesis of an updated pedon data set for SOC storage (kg C m(-2)) in deep soils of the northern circumpolar permafrost regions, with separate data sets for the 100-200 cm (524 pedons) and 200300 cm (356 pedons) depth ranges. These pedons have been grouped into the North American and Eurasian sectors and the mean SOC storage for different soil taxa (subdivided into Gelisols including the sub-orders Histels, Turbels, Orthels, permafrost-free Histosols, and permafrost-free mineral soil orders) has been added to the updated NCSCDv2. The updated version of the data set is freely available on-line in different file formats and spatial resolutions that enable spatially explicit applications in GIS mapping and terrestrial ecosystem models. While this newly compiled data set adds to our knowledge of SOC in the 100-300 cm depth range, it also reveals that large uncertainties remain. Identified data gaps include spatial coverage of deep (> 100 cm) pedons in many regions as well as the spatial extent of areas with thin soils overlying bedrock and the quantity and distribution of massive ground ice. An open access data-portal for the pedon data set and the GIS-data sets is available online at http://bolin.su.se/data/ncscd/. The NCSCDv2 data set has a digital object identifier (doi: 10.5879/ECDS/00000002).

AB Projected changes in climate could shift northern peatlands from their current status as net C sinks toward that of being net C sources by changing soil temperatures and hydrology. We assessed the importance of water table and soil temperature as controls over ecosystem respiration in a bog and sedge fen in northern Minnesota, USA, by means of a manipulative mesocosm experiment. Fifty-four intact monoliths were removed from a bog and a fen and installed in insulated tanks that permitted control of the water table and were heated by overhead infrared heaters. The experimental design was a fully crossed factorial combination of two communities, three water tables, and three heat levels. Fcosystem respiration as indicated by emission of CO2 and CH4, dissolved nutrient fluxes, and productivity were measured and summarized for each growing season from 1995 to 1997.
   Seasonal ecosystem respiration (ER) as indicated by CO2 emissions responded almost exclusively to soil temperature and did not differ between community types (similar to 630 g C/ m(2)) or with water table level. These results suggest that community type, within certain limits, will not be an important factor in predicting temperature-driven increases in ER.
   The response of CH4 flux to soil temperature and water table setting became progressively stronger in each succeeding growing season. Seasonal CH4 emissions were on average three times higher in the bog than in the fen mesocosms (21 vs. 7 g C/m(2)). Aboveground net primary productivity and dissolved N retention were also higher in the bog mesocosms. There were strong correlations between CH4 flux and N retention, but generally weak correlations between CH4 and plant primary production. The relatively lower CH4 emissions from the fen mesocosms appear to result mainly from higher rates of methanotrophy in the aerated zone, possibly reinforced by the effects of higher porewater N concentrations and lower primary productivity compared to the bogs.
   The results confirm the existence of strong environmental controls over ER and methanogenesis, which are modulated by complex interactions between plant community and soil nutrient dynamics. The differential responses of these ecosystem functions to climate change may complicate efforts to predict future changes in C dynamics in these important repositories of soil C.

AB Understanding past climate and environmental conditions depends largely on accurate interpretations of proxy records from a range of environments, including tropical wetlands and lakes. Lipid biomarker analysis can provide important information about the sources of the accumulated organic material, and thus about the environmental information contained therein. Here we use n-alkane distributions and stable carbon isotopes of leaf waxes (delta C-13(wax)) to identify the sources of organic matter (OM) of a 2000-year long sediment/peat record from Lake Pa Kho (LPK) in northeastern Thailand, and to constrain the mechanisms that cause shifts in delta C-13(wax) and in delta C-13 of bulk organic matter (delta C-13(bulk)). Our results show three main sources of OM: terrestrial plants, aquatic macrophytes and algae. The delta C-13 values of the long chain n-alkanes, show two distinct groups: C-27-C-31 and C-33-C-35 n-alkanes, where the delta C-13 values of C-33-C-35 n-alkanes reflect that of delta C-13(bulk). Lower moisture availability on the wetland, known from other sedimentary evidence, was characterized by low carbon isotope values typically seen for C3 plants, whereas greater moisture availability corresponded to higher delta C-13 values (around -20 parts per thousand) of C33-C35 n-alkanes, resembling a typical C4 plant signal. However, various lines of evidence argue against large shifts between C3 and C4 plant input. Instead, we suggest that the high delta C-13 values were indirectly caused by higher aquatic productivity during periods of greater moisture availability, decreasing dissolved CO2, but increasing bicarbonate availability caused by higher pH. This caused the dominant macrophytes (e.g., Potamogeton spp.) to shift their carbon source from CO2 to bicarbonate, which has much higher delta C-13 values. Our results show that the environmental context should be taken into account when interpreting n-alkane delta C-13 variability as a paleo-environmental/climatic signal as this contains several important variables that need to be disentangled and explained.

AB Methane concentration [CH4] and stable isotope ratio values (delta C-13) characterize methanogenic and methanotrophic processes within two contrasting peatland ecosystems of the Fluxnet Canada Research Network: (i) a western Canada peatland fen in northern Alberta (Fen) and (ii) an eastern Canada peatland bog in southeastern Ontario (Bog). We use carbon isotope ratio discrimination of produced methane (delta C-13(CH4)) from the precursor carbon compounds (delta C-13(preC)) to estimate the relative proportions of archaebacterial acetoclastic methanogenesis (AM) and hydrogenotrophic carbonate reduction methanogenesis (HM) in these terrestrial ecosystems. The [CH4] and delta C-13(CH4) signatures describe contrasts in the methanogenic and methanotrophic processes between the Fen and the Bog. The differences are substantiated by stable hydrogen isotope ratio (delta D) separation between the dissolved delta D-CH4 and co-existing delta D-H2O. Methanogenesis at the Fen is dominated by AM, in contrast to the Bog, which is essentially HM. We suggest that this is potentially a result of differences in type/quality of organic substrates.

AB Northern wetlands may be a potential carbon source to the atmosphere upon global warming, particularly with regard to methane. However, recent conclusions have largely been based on short-term field measurements. We incubated three wetland soils representing a range of substrate quality for 80 wk in the laboratory under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 15 degrees and 30 degrees C. The soils were obtained from a Scirpus-Carex-dominated meadow in an abandoned beaver pond and from the surface and at 1 m depth of a spruce (Picea)-Sphagnum bog in Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota. Substrate quality was assessed by fractionation of carbon compounds and summarized using principal components analysis. Nitrogen and carbon mineralization, the partitioning of carbon between carbon dioxide and methane, pH, and Eh were measured periodically over the course of the incubation. The responses of nitrogen mineralization, carbon mineralization, and trace gas partitioning to both temperature and aeration depended strongly on the substrate quality of the soils. Sedge meadow soil had the highest nitrogen and carbon mineralization rates and methane production under anaerobic conditions, and carbon mineralization under aerobic conditions, but the surface peats had the highest nitrogen mineralization rates under aerobic conditions. Methanogenesis was highest in the sedge soil but less sensitive to temperature than in the peats. A double exponential model showed that most of the variation in nitrogen and carbon mineralization among the soils and treatments was accounted for by differences in the size and kinetics of a relatively small labile pool. The kinetics of this pool were more sensitive to changes in temperature and aeration than that of the larger recalcitrant pool. Principal components analysis separated the soils on the basis of labile and recalcitrant carbon fractions. Total C and N mineralization correlated positively with the factor representing labile elements, while methanogenesis also showed a negative correlation with the factor representing recalcitrant elements. Estimates of atmospheric feedbacks from northern wetlands upon climatic change must account for extreme local variation in substrate quality and wetland type; global projections based on extrapolations from a few field measurements do not account for this local variation and may be in error.

AB Question: Peatlands are globally important for carbon storage due to the imbalance between plant biomass production and decomposition. Distribution of both live standing biomass (BM, dry mass g/m(2)) and biomass production (BMP, dry mass gm(-2) growing season(-1)) are known to be dependent on the water table (WT). However, the relations of BM and BMP to WT variation are poorly known. Here we investigated, how the above- and below-ground BM and BMP of three different plant functional types (PFTs), dwarf shrubs, sedges and Sphagnum mosses, relate to natural WT variation within an ombrotrophic boreal bog. In addition, we estimated ecosystem-level BMP and compared that with ecosystem net primary production (NPP) derived from eddy covariance (EC) measurements.
   Location: Siikaneva bog, Ruovesi, Finland.
   Methods: We quantified above- and below-ground BM and BMP of PFTs along the WT gradient, divided into six plant community types. Plant community scale BM and BMP were up-scaled to the ecosystem level. NPP was derived from EC measurements using a literature-based ratio of heterotrophic respiration to total ecosystem respiration.
   Results: BM varied from 211 to 979 g/m(2) among the plant community types, decreasing gradually from dry to wet community types. In contrast, BMP was similar between plant community types (162-216 g/m(2)), except on nearly vegetation-free bare peat surfaces where it was low (38 g/m(2)). Vascular plant BM turnover rate (BMP:BM, per year) varied from 0.14 to 0.30 among the plant community types, being highest in sedge-dominated hollows. On average 56% of the vascular BM was produced below ground. Mosses, when present, produced on average 31% of the total BM, ranging from 16% to 53% depending on community type. EC-derived NPP was higher than measured BMP due to underestimation of certain components.
   Conclusions: We found that the diversity of PFTs decreases the spatial variability in productivity of a boreal bog ecosystem. The observed even distribution of BMP resulted from different WT optima and BMP:BM of dwarf shrubs, sedges and Sphagnum species. These differences in biomass turnover rate and species responses to environmental conditions may provide a resilience mechanism for bog ecosystems in changing conditions.

AB Nitrogen (N) pollution of peatlands alters their carbon (C) balances, yet long-term effects and controls are poorly understood. We applied the model PEATBOG to explore impacts of long-term nitrogen (N) fertilization on C cycling in an ombrotrophic bog. Simulations of summer gross ecosystem production (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were evaluated against 8 years of observations and extrapolated for 80 years to identify potential effects of N fertilization and factors influencing model behaviour. The model successfully simulated moss decline and raised GEP, ER and NEE on fertilized plots. GEP was systematically overestimated in the model compared to the field data due to factors that can be related to differences in vegetation distribution (e.g. shrubs vs. graminoid vegetation) and to high tolerance of vascular plants to N deposition in the model. Model performance regarding the 8-year response of GEP and NEE to N input was improved by introducing an N content threshold shifting the response of photosynthetic capacity (GEP(max)) to N content in shrubs and graminoids from positive to negative at high N contents. Such changes also eliminated the competitive advantages of vascular species and led to resilience of mosses in the long-term. Regardless of the large changes of C fluxes over the short-term, the simulated GEP, ER and NEE after 80 years depended on whether a graminoid- or shrub-dominated system evolved. When the peatland remained shrub-Sphagnumdominated, it shifted to a C source after only 10 years of fertilization at 6.4 gNm(-2) yr(-1), whereas this was not the case when it became graminoid-dominated. The modelling results thus highlight the importance of ecosystem adaptation and reaction of plant functional types to N deposition, when predicting the future C balance of N-polluted cool temperate bogs.

AB Methane is the second most important anthropogenically produced greenhouse gas, and radiocarbon (C-14) analysis is extremely valuable in identifying its age and source in the environment. At the NERC Radiocarbon Facility (East Kilbride, UK) we have developed expertise in analysis of methane C-14 concentration and methodological approaches to field sampling over the past 20 years. This has opened a wide range of applications, which have mainly focused on (1) the age and source of methane emitted by peatlands and organic soils (e.g. to quantify the release of ancient carbon), (2) the source of aquatic emissions of methane, and (3) the age of methane generated by amenity and illegal landfill. Many of these scientifically important applications involve challenging sampling and measurement considerations, which our development program has continually aimed to overcome. Here, we describe our current methods, and recent improvements to aid field collection of samples in remote locations. We present the results of tests which (1) show the effectiveness of our methods to remove contaminants, especially CO2, (2) quantify the 14 C background contribution, and (3) demonstrate the reliability of metal gas storage canisters for sample storage.

AB Wetland restoration on peat islands previously drained for agriculture has potential to reverse land subsidence and sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide as peat accretes. However, the emission of methane could potentially offset the greenhouse gas benefits of captured carbon. As microbial communities play a key role in governing wetland greenhouse gas fluxes, we are interested in how microbial community composition and functions are associated with wetland hydrology, biogeochemistry, and methane emission, which is critical to modeling the microbial component in wetland methane fluxes and to managing restoration projects for maximal carbon sequestration. Here, we couple sequence-based methods with biogeochemical and greenhouse gas measurements to interrogate microbial communities from a pilot-scale restored wetland in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California, revealing considerable spatial heterogeneity even within this relatively small site. A number of microbial populations and functions showed strong correlations with electron acceptor availability and methane production; some also showed a preference for association with plant roots. Marker gene phylogenies revealed a diversity of major methane-producing and -consuming populations and suggested novel diversity within methanotrophs. Methanogenic archaea were observed in all samples, as were nitrate-, sulfate-, and metal-reducing bacteria, indicating that no single terminal electron acceptor was preferred despite differences in energetic favorability and suggesting spatial microheterogeneity and microniches. Notably, methanogens were negatively correlated with nitrate-, sulfate-, and metal-reducing bacteria and were most abundant at sampling sites with high peat accretion and low electron acceptor availability, where methane production was highest.
   IMPORTANCE Wetlands are the largest nonanthropogenic source of atmospheric methane but also a key global carbon reservoir. Characterizing belowground microbial communities that mediate carbon cycling in wetlands is critical to accurately predicting their responses to changes in land management and climate. Here, we studied a restored wetland and revealed substantial spatial heterogeneity in biogeochemistry, methane production, and microbial communities, largely associated with the wetland hydraulic design. We observed patterns in microbial community composition and functions correlated with biogeochemistry and methane production, including diverse microorganisms involved in methane production and consumption. We found that methanogenesis gene abundance is inversely correlated with genes from pathways exploiting other electron acceptors, yet the ubiquitous presence of genes from all these pathways suggests that diverse electron acceptors contribute to the energetic balance of the ecosystem. These investigations represent an important step toward effective management of wetlands to reduce methane flux to the atmosphere and enhance belowground carbon storage.

AB Over a one-year study period (2003), we monitored total Hg (HgT) and methyl Hg (MeHg) at two sites in a Swedish forest stream located above (Site(ref)) and below a stretch of Hg-contaminated sediments (Site(Hg)). We also monitored HgT, MeHg, and ancillary water chemistry in peat water close to the stream and HgT in open field wet deposition. Despite the presence of historical Hg contaminants, direct atmospheric Hg deposition and transfer of Hg from the catchment explained more than half of the annual HgT load at Site(Hg). The concentrations of both HgT and MeHg were sensitive to changes in water discharge (Q) and water temperature (T) at both sites, suggesting that the stream HgT and MeHg load can change dramatically in response to changing weather conditions. The 2003 data together with data from 1996 disclosed intersite differences and temporal variation in the relationships between HgT, MeHg, and TOC (total organic carbon), reflecting variable sources of HgT, MeHg, and TOC and temporal changes in factors affecting Hg speciation.

AB A two-step procedure is described for the synthesis of a carbon material with a similar composition and properties as peat. The produced hydrochar is made suitable for agricultural applications by removing plant growing inhibitory substances. Wet household waste such as fruit peel, coffee grounds, inedible vegetable parts, or wet lignocellulosic material in general, are treated in presence of water at 215 degrees C and 21 bar in an autoclave, i.e., by hydrothermal carbonization. All these leftovers have a considerable water content of up to 90 weight % (wt%). Adding water extends the procedure to drier materials such as nutshells or even garden prunings and compostable polymers, i.e., the plastic bag for collection of the leftovers.
   Usually, the resulting carbon material, called hydrochar, produces a negative effect on plant growth when added to soil. It is supposed that this effect is caused by adsorbed phytotoxic compounds. A simple post-treatment under inert atmosphere (absence of oxygen) at 275 degrees C removes these substances. Therefore, the raw hydrochar is placed on a glass frit of a vertical tubular quartz reactor. A nitrogen gas flow is applied in down-flow direction. The tube is heated to the desired temperature by means of a heating mantle for up to one hour.
   The success of the thermal treatment is easily quantified by thermogravimetry (TG), carried out in air. A weight loss is determined when the temperature of 275 degrees C is reached, since volatile content is desorbed. Its amount is reduced in the final material, in comparison to the untreated hydrochar.
   The two-step treatment converts household leftovers, including compostable bags employed for their collection, into a carbon material that may serve as plant growth promoter and, at the same time, as a carbon sink for climate change mitigation.

AB We present inverse modelling (top down) estimates of European methane (CH4) emissions for 2006-2012 based on a new quality-controlled and harmonised in situ data set from 18 European atmospheric monitoring stations. We applied an ensemble of seven inverse models and performed four inversion experiments, investigating the impact of different sets of stations and the use of a priori information on emissions.
   The inverse models infer total CH4 emissions of 26.8 (20.2-29.7) TgCH(4) yr(-1) (mean, 10th and 90th percentiles from all inversions) for the EU-28 for 2006-2012 from the four inversion experiments. For comparison, total anthropogenic CH4 emissions reported to UNFCCC (bottom up, based on statistical data and emissions factors) amount to only 21.3 TgCH(4) yr(-1) (2006) to 18.8 TgCH(4) yr(-1) (2012). A potential explanation for the higher range of top-down estimates compared to bottom-up inventories could be the contribution from natural sources, such as peatlands, wetlands, and wet soils. Based on seven different wetland inventories from the Wetland and Wetland CH4 Inter-comparison of Models Project (WETCHIMP), total wetland emissions of 4.3 (2.3-8.2) TgCH(4) yr(-1) from the EU-28 are estimated. The hypothesis of significant natural emissions is supported by the finding that several inverse models yield significant seasonal cycles of derived CH4 emissions with maxima in summer, while anthropogenic CH4 emissions are assumed to have much lower seasonal variability. Taking into account the wetland emissions from the WETCHIMP ensemble, the top-down estimates are broadly consistent with the sum of anthropogenic and natural bottom-up inventories. However, the contribution of natural sources and their regional distribution remain rather uncertain.
   Furthermore, we investigate potential biases in the inverse models by comparison with regular aircraft profiles at four European sites and with vertical profiles obtained during the Infrastructure for Measurement of the European Carbon Cycle (IMECC) aircraft campaign. We present a novel approach to estimate the biases in the derived emissions, based on the comparison of simulated and measured enhancements of CH4 compared to the background, integrated over the entire boundary layer and over the lower troposphere. The estimated average regional biases range between -40 and 20% at the aircraft profile sites in France, Hungary and Poland.

AB Industrial activities for resource extraction have led to a network of seismic lines across Canada's boreal regions where peatlands often make up over 50% of the landscape. These clearings can have a significant influence on ecosystem functioning through vegetation removal, flattening of microtopography, altering hydrological pathways, and impacting biogeochemical processes. Recently, there has been a concerted effort to restore seismic lines to bring back the localized microtopography and encourage ecosystem recovery. A common restoration approach on seismic lines is mounding, which involves using machinery to recreate natural microtopography. Research is scarce on the impact on soil properties following both these disturbances and subsequent restoration on organic soils. The objectives of this study were to: (1) identify differences in soil physical and chemical characteristics between areas disturbed by seismic lines and adjacent natural areas and (2) determine changes to soil physical and chemical properties following the mounding restoration technique. Research was undertaken at two contrasting boreal ecosites (a poor mesic and a treed fen) near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. In July 2018, we collected soil samples at 34 seismic line locations, both on the line and 20 m into the adjacent undisturbed area. Samples were analyzed for bulk density, volumetric water content (VWC), organic matter (OM) content, C:N ratios, and delta C-13/delta N-15 isotope analysis. Seismic line disturbances had a significant impact on soil properties, with increased bulk density and VWC on the line at both ecosites. We found an almost 40% reduction in OM on the line compared to natural areas at the poor mesic site, implying changes to carbon cycling, increased mineralization rates, and carbon loss from the system. There was also delta C-13/delta N-15 enrichment and narrower C:N ratios on the line, indicating increased decomposition. We found evidence of increased decomposition on the mounds created after restoration at the treed fen. Our results highlight a trade-off between restoration activities that may encourage recovery but also cause increased carbon losses from the system. This research is a first step in gaining a better understanding of these impacts in light of current restoration practices to ensure best management practices for improving ecosystem functioning.

AB Carbon mass balance studies of 20 small, forested catchments and seven lakes on the Precambrian Shield in central Ontario during a 12-year period have shown that most carbon in the study lakes is derived from terrestrial sources, primarily peatlands, and that carbon retained by lakes (total inputs less loss via outflow from the lake) is partitioned between lake sediments and the atmosphere. The partitioning of retained carbon is a function of lake alkalinity: the ratio of evaded/sediment carbon increases with decreasing alkalinity. These carbon flux relationships were applied to the global boreal forest biome to evaluate the role of aquatic systems with respect to carbon fluxes and pools within the biome. We calculate that approximately 66 Tg of organic and inorganic carbon are exported annually from the boreal forest biome to adjacent surface waters of which 14 to 36 Tg reach coastal waters. The remainder is either evaded to the atmosphere (12 to 21 Tg yr(-1)) or stored in lake sediments (18 to 31 Tg yr(-1)). Approximately 120 Pg of carbon may be stored in boreal lake sediments, a conservative estimate based on an accumulation period of 5,000 years and a size comparable to recent boreal pool estimates of 419 Pg for peatlands and 64 Pg for plant biomass. Hence the amount of total carbon stored in the boreal forest biome may be significantly larger because of storage in lake sediments.

AB Plants store nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs), such as sugars and starch, to use as carbon and energy sources for daily maintenance and growth needs as well as during times of stress. Allocation of NSCs to storage provides an important physiological strategy associated with future growth and survival, and thus understanding the seasonal patterns of NSC reserves provides insight into how species with different traits (e.g., growth form, leaf habit, wood anatomy) may respond to stress. We characterized the seasonal patterns of NSCs in four woody boreal plant species in Minnesota, USA. Sugar and starch concentrations were measured across the year in the roots and branches of two conifer trees, black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) and eastern tamarack (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch), as well as in the leaves and branches of two evergreen broadleaf shrubs, bog Labrador tea (Rhododendron groenlandicum (Oeder) Kron & Judd) and leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata (L.) Moench). In general, seasonal variation was dominated by changes in starch across all organs and species. While similar seasonal patterns of NSCs were observed in the shrubs, different seasonal patterns were observed between the trees, particularly in the roots. Our results suggest that species-specific traits likely have consequences for organ-level storage dynamics, which may influence whole-plant growth and survival under global change.

AB Hydrophysical properties of peat influence the partitioning of rainfall into infiltration versus runoff, determine water flow and solute transport patterns, and regulate the carbon and nitrogen cycles in peatlands. Compared with mineral soils, our understanding of hydraulic properties of peat soils is limited, especially of the temporal dynamics of peat properties. A data set of peat subsidence as well as the bulk density (BD) change rate following artificial drainage was assembled from the literature. The collected data cover a time period of up to 272 years of land drainage for forestry and agriculture in boreal and temperate climate zones. The results show that the subsidence rate and BD change rate, and hydrophysical properties of peat can be estimated based on land drainage duration and land use. The most severe shift in pore structure of peat occurs within the first 20 years of land drainage. Peatland drainage reduces macroporosity with pore diameter greater than 50 mu m, but increases the volume of pores <5 mu m. In the long term, peat thickness loss is responsible for more than 80% of water storage loss. In conclusion, the derived functions between subsidence rate, BD change rate, and drainage duration provide a new approach to estimate the hydrophysical properties of peat (pore structure, saturated hydraulic conductivity, specific yield, and soil water storage) on a centennial scale. The derived hydrophysical parameter values can be used for long-term hydrological modeling, especially if measured hydraulic parameters of peat are not available.

AB The chemical transformations that govern storage, degradation, and loss of organic matter in northern peatlands are poorly characterized, despite the significance of these peat deposits as pivotal reservoirs in the global carbon cycle. One of the most challenging problems concerns the character of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in peat porewaters, particularly higher-molecular weight compounds that may function either as non-reactive sinks or reactive intermediates for organic byproducts of microbial decay. The complexity of these large molecules has defied attempts to characterize their molecular structure in bulk samples with a high degree of precision. We therefore determined the composition and reactivity of DOM from representative bog and fen sites in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands (GLAP) in northern Minnesota, USA. We applied four complementary techniques: electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR MS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR), specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. We observed that the vast majority (>80%) of molecular formulas that appear in the surface bog DOM are also present at 2.9 m depth, indicating that much of DOM in the bog is resistant to microbial degradation. In contrast to bog samples, a considerable number of new compounds with low O/C and high H/C elemental ratios were observed in the 3 m fen horizon relative to surface samples. These results indicate a more pronounced difference in the composition of surface and deep DOM in the fen.
   SUVA, determined at 254 nm, indicated significantly lower aromaticity in deep fen samples relative to deep bog samples. This trend was verified by H-1 NMR. Aromatic and carbohydrate components represented up to 70% of deep bog DOM but comprised a much smaller proportion of deep fen DOM, which was dominated by functionalized and non-functionalized aliphatics. Molecular formula data determined by FT-ICR mass spectrometry were consistent with results from optical and NMR spectroscopy measurements and showed that compounds with low O/C and high H/C were generated with depth in the fen. Such compounds were absent in both surface fen and in surface and deep bog samples respectively, providing further evidence of qualitative and quantitative differences in the evolution of DOM in fens and bogs. These differences, attributed to either variations in source vegetation or environmental factors that render DOM more reactive in fen sites or less reactive in bog sites, have important implications for the response of peatlands to climate change, since climatic change leading to moister conditions may enhance the abundance of sedge-dominated fens and increase the pool of more labile soil carbon.

AB Nitrogen (N) is a limiting nutrient in many peatland ecosystems. Enhanced N deposition, a major component of global climate change, affects ecosystem carbon (C) balance and alters soil C storage by changing plant and soil properties. However, the effects of enhanced N deposition on peatland ecosystems are poorly understood. We conducted a two-year N additions field experiment in a peatland dominated by Eriophorum vaginatum in the Da Xing'an Mountains, Northeast China. Four levels of N treatments were applied: (1) CK (no N added), (2) N1 (6 g N m(-2) yr(-1)), (3) N2 (12 g N m(-2) yr(-1)), and (4) N3 (24 gN m(-2) yr(-1)). Plant and soil material was harvested at the end of the Second growing season. N additions increased litter N and phosphorus (P) content, as well as S-glucosidase, invertase, and acid-phosphatase activity, but decreased litter C:N and C:P ratios. Litter carbon content remained unchanged. N additions increased available NH4+-N and NO3--N as well as total Gram-positive (Gram+), Gram-negative (Gram-), and total bacterial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) in shallow soil (0-15 cm depth). An increase in these PLFAs was accompanied by a decrease in soil labile organic C (microbial biomass carbon and dissolved organic carbon), and appeared to accelerate decomposition and reduce the stability of the soil C pool. Invertase and urease activity in shallow soils and acid-phosphatase activity in deep soils (15-30 cm depth) was inhibited by N additions. Together, these findings suggest that an increase in N deposition in peatlands could accelerate litter decomposition and the loss of labile C, as well as alter microbial biomass and function.

AB The profile distributions of specific sulfur forms were examined at a site in a Louisiana salt marsh over a 1-yr period.  Soil samples were fractionated into acid-volatile sulfides, HCl-soluble sulfur, elemental sulfur, pyrite sulfur, ester-sulfate sulfur, carbon-bonded sulfur, and total sulfur.  Inorganic sulfur constituted 16% to 36% of total sulfur, with pyrite sulfur representing < 2%.  Pyrite sulfur content in marsh soil was relatively high in winter.  Pyrite sulfur and elemental sulfur together accounted for 4% to 24% of the inorganic sulfur fraction.  Between 74% and 95% of inorganic sulfur was present as the HCl-soluble sulfur form.  A significant negative correlation between acid-volatile sulfides and elemental sulfur observed in summer suggested the transformation of sulfides to elemental sulfur.  Organic sulfur, in the forms of ester-sulfate sulfur and carbon-bonded sulfur, predominated in all sampling periods, comprising 64% to 84% of total sulfur.  The conversion of ester-sulfate sulfur into carbon-bonded sulfur was more likely to occur in winter than in other seasons.  Carbon-bonded sulfur accounted for 53% to 89% of the organic sulfur.  Organic sulfur was the major contributor to the variation of total sulfur in all seasons studied.  Total sulfur concentration showed a statistically significant increase with depth.

AB Water table decline is a major threat to soil organic carbon in peatlands worldwide principally because it may largely increase soil CO2 emission (SCE). This study is to determine the response of SCE to water table decline in the Zoige peatland of Tibetan Plateau, which has experienced rapid decline of water table due to climate change and anthropogenic drainage. We conducted a field in situ drainage experiment consisting of low (plots surrounded by 50 cm deep ditches), intermediate (20 cm deep) and high (intact) water table levels. The experiment lasted for about four years, during which we measured SCE rate and associated variables including soil temperature and moisture with a higher frequency in the growing season (May-September) than the non-growing season (October-April). Experimental drainage decreased water table height by ca. 12 cm and 15 cm (relative to the intact) and soil moisture (at 5 cm soil) by 6% and 12% (relative to 45% in the intact) on average in intermediate and low water table treatments, respectively, but it did not affect soil temperature during the experimental years.
   The effect of drainage on SCE varied with season. In the non-growing season, the drainage effect was nonsignificant in each measurement possibly because the low-temperature effect overrode the drainage effect on SCE. In the growing season, the drainage mostly increased the emission except for several cases, in which a negative effect was observed. The negative effect of drainage could be due to the low soil moisture (< 25%) in the drained treatments. Provided that the magnitude and the duration of the SCE increase were greater than those of the decrease, it can be estimated that drainage increased SCE by 17% and 20% on average in the low and the intermediate water table treatments, respectively, over the experimental years. Our results suggest that water table decline may facilitate net carbon emission and hence decrease soil carbon storage in the Zoige peatland. We call for artificial filling of the ditches that were historically created by both human beings and storm waters to increase water table in the Zoige peatland.

AB Dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria (DIRB) are known to use humic substances (HS) as electron shuttles for dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR) by transferring electrons to HS-quinone moieties, which in turn rapidly reduce Fe(III) oxides. However, the potential for HS to serve as a source of organic carbon (OC) that can donate electrons for DIR is unknown. We studied whether humic acids (HA) and humins (HM) recovered from peat soil by sodium pyrophosphate extraction could serve as both electron shuttles and electron donors for DIR by freshwater sediment microorganisms. Both HA and HM served as electron shuttles in cultures amended with glucose. However, only HA served as an electron donor for DIR. Metagenomes from HA-containing cultures had an overrepresentation of genes involved in polysaccharide and to a lesser extent aromatic compound degradation, suggesting complex OC metabolism. Genomic searches for the porin-cytochrome complex involved in DIR resulted in matches to Ignavibacterium/Melioribacter, DIRB capable of polymeric OC metabolism. These results indicate that such taxa may have played a role in both DIR and decomposition of complex OC. Our results suggest that decomposition of HS coupled to DIR and other anaerobic pathways could play an important role in soil and sediment OC metabolism.

AB Sphagnum-dominated peatlands are major carbon pools and sinks, but these functions are threatened by climate change. There is, therefore, a need to better understand how microclimatic changes (soil temperature, soil moisture and water table depth) are affecting their functioning. Experimental studies on Sphagnum peatlands conducted under precisely controlled (e.g. mesocosm) conditions are relatively rare, especially those aiming to understand the system as a whole. Furthermore, mesocosm designs are generally described only briefly in the literature. In this article we provide a comprehensive account of a mesocosm experiment designed to study the response of Sphagnum peatlands to water table manipulation. We describe our experimental setup (3 water levels x 3 amplitudes of water table fluctuation x 5 replicates); and explain how we built the mesocosms, the issues we faced and the solutions we chose to solve them. We provide a detailed description of the devices we conceived to manipulate the water level, including software codes and electronic diagrams (as supplementary material), and explain how to address data loss in such an experimental design. We show that it is possible to build a reliable and powerful experimental setup at moderate cost using standard technology. The aim of this article is to provide a useful resource for researchers wishing to design similar experiments in the future.

AB Members of the phylum Planctomycetes colonize a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial habitats, but their functional role in the environment remains poorly understood. One of the suggested roles of these bacteria is their participation in degradation of biopolymers of plant and fungal cell walls. The first experimental evidence for the presence of chitin-degrading ability was obtained for Fimbriiglobus ruber SP5(T). The genome of this planctomycete encodes the complete set of enzymes required for utilization of chitin, including the chitinase affiliated with the glycoside hydrolase family GH18. Phylogenetic analysis of the chitinase from Fimbriiglobus revealed occurrence of its close homologue in the genome of another planctomycete, Planctomicrobium piriforme P3(T). Experimental tests performed with the type strain P3(T) and the newly obtained isolate of this species, strain PX70, confirmed their ability to grow on amorphous chitin as a source of carbon and nitrogen. Activities of the enzymes involved in chitin degradation, which were determined in tests with fluorochrome-labeled chito-oligosaccharides, were exclusively associated with planctomycete cells and were absent from the culture liquid. Further search in the protein database revealed a number of close homologues of these chitinases in other planctomycetes affiliated with different taxonomic groups. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis pointed to planctomycetes as a possible source of multiple horizontal transfers of chitinase genes to other bacterial phyla, as well as to some eukaryotes. Obtaining proofs for chitin-degrading capabilities in Planctomicrobiumpiriforme suggests emendation of the earlier published description of this species and extends the list of planctomycetes with experimentally confirmed chitinolytic potential.

AB Marshes in the urban Jamaica Bay Estuary, New York, USA are disappearing at an average rate of 13 ha/yr, and multiple stressors (e.g., wastewater inputs, dredging activities, groundwater removal, and global warming) may be contributing to marsh losses. Among these stressors, wastewater nutrients are suspected to be an important contributing cause of marsh deterioration. We used census data, radiometric dating, stable nitrogen isotopes, and soil surveys to examine the temporal relationships between human population growth and soil nitrogen; and we evaluated soil structure with computer-aided tomography, surface elevation and sediment accretion trends, carbon dioxide emissions, and soil shear strength to examine differences among disappearing (Black Bank and Big Egg) and stable marshes (JoCo). Radiometric dating and nitrogen isotope analyses suggested a rapid increase in human wastewater nutrients beginning in the late 1840s, and a tapering off beginning in the 1930s when wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were first installed. Current WWTPs nutrient loads to Jamaica Bay are approximately 13 995 kg N/d and 2767 kg P/d. At Black Bank, the biomass and abundance of roots and rhizomes and percentage of organic matter on soil were significantly lower, rhizomes larger in diameter, carbon dioxide emission rates and peat particle density significantly greater, and soil strength significantly lower compared to the stable JoCo Marsh, suggesting Black Bank has elevated decomposition rates, more decomposed peat, and highly waterlogged peat. Despite these differences, the rates of accretion and surface elevation change were similar for both marshes, and the rates of elevation change approximated the long term relative rate of sea level rise estimated from tide gauge data at nearby Sandy Hook, New Jersey. We hypothesize that Black Bank marsh kept pace with sea level rise by the accretion of material on the marsh surface, and the maintenance of soil volume through production of larger diameter rhizomes and swelling (dilation) of waterlogged peat. JoCo Marsh kept pace with sea-level rise through surface accretion and soil organic matter accumulation. Understanding the effects of multiple stressors, including nutrient enrichment, on soil structure, organic matter accumulation, and elevation change will better inform management decisions aimed at maintaining and restoring coastal marshes.

AB All aerobic methanotrophic bacteria described to date are unable to grow on substrates containing carbon-carbon bonds. Here we demonstrate that members of the recently discovered genus Methylocella are an exception to this. These bacteria are able to use as their sole energy source the one-carbon compounds methane and methanol, as well as the multicarbon compounds acetate, pyruvate, succinate, malate, and ethanol. To conclusively verify facultative growth, acetate and methane were used as model substrates in growth experiments with the type strain Methylocella silvestris BL2. Quantitative real-time PCR targeting the mmoX gene, which encodes a subunit of soluble methane monooxygenase, showed that copies of this gene increased in parallel with cell counts during growth on either acetate or methane as the sole substrate. This verified. that cells possessing the genetic basis of methane oxidation grew on acetate as well as methane. Cloning of 16S rRNA genes and fluorescence in situ hybridization with strain-specific and genus-specific oligonucleotide probes detected no contaminants in cultures. The growth rate and carbon conversion efficiency were higher on acetate than on methane, and when both substrates were provided in excess, acetate was preferably used and methane oxidation was shut down. Our data demonstrate that not all methanotrophic bacteria are limited to growing on one-carbon compounds. This could have major implications for understanding the factors controlling methane fluxes in the environment.

AB Climate change mediated drying of boreal peatlands is expected to enhance peatland afforestation and wildfire vulnerability. The water table depth-afforestation feedback represents a positive feedback that can enhance peat drying and consolidation and thereby increase peat burn severity; exacerbating the challenges and costs of wildfire suppression efforts and potentially shifting the peatland to a persistent source of atmospheric carbon. To address this wildfire management challenge, we examined burn severity across a gradient of drying in a black spruce dominated peatland that was partially drained in 1975-1980 and burned in the 2016 Fort McMurray Horse River wildfire. We found that post-drainage black spruce annual ring width increased substantially with intense drainage. Average (+/- SD) basal diameter was 2.6 +/- 1.2 cm, 3.2 +/- 2.0 cm and 7.9 +/- 4.7 cm in undrained (UD), moderately drained (MD) and heavily drained (HD) treatments, respectively. Depth of burn was significantly different between treatments (p < 0.001) and averaged (+/- SD) 2.5 +/- 3.5 cm, 6.4 +/- 5.0 cm and 36.9 +/- 29.6 cm for the UD, MD and HD treatments, respectively. The high burn severity in the HD treatment included 38% of the treatment that experienced combustion of the entire peat profile, and we estimate that overall 51% of the HD pre-burn peat carbon stock was lost. We argue that the HD treatment surpassed an ecohydrological tipping point to high severity peat burn that may be identified using black spruce stand characteristics in boreal plains bogs. While further studies are needed, we believe that quantifying this threshold will aid in developing effective adaptive management techniques and protecting boreal peatland carbon stocks.

AB We investigated the effects of drying-wetting and freezing-thawing cycles on the emission of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide and methane from intact soil cores from farmed organic soils at sites in Germany, Sweden and Finland. During the first week following wetting or thawing, cores from the German and Swedish sites produced an up to 1000-fold increase in N2O emission rates. The total surplus N2O emission due to the first wetting event ranged between 3 and 140 mg N-N2O m(-2), and between 13 and 340 mg N-N2O m(-2) due to the first thawing event but declined following two successive freeze-thaw events. Wetting and thawing produced a greater surplus emission of N2O from grassland sites compared to arable sites. Following wetting, denitrification was responsible for the majority of N2O emission from the German grassland soil while in the German ploughed soil and the Swedish soils denitrification was responsible for less than 60% of the N2O emission. In contrast, following thawing, denitrification was responsible for < 40% of N2O emission from the German grassland soil while in the remaining German and Swedish soils denitrification was responsible for most of the emission. Wetting or thawing of soil cores from the Finnish sites did not result in any significant increase in N2O emission rates perhaps because a prolonged drought at the time of soil core collection had changed soil properties considerably. The CO2 emission rates increased up to 5-fold following wetting or thawing, The total surplus CO2 emission ranged from 0.0 to 13 9 C-CO2 m(-2), differed between locations and land use, and decreased during successive cycles of freezing and thawing. The total surplus CO2 emission from grassland sites following thawing was generally higher than from arable and forest sites probably due to decomposition of carbon sources liberated from stressed grass roots. Methane emission rates were very small and often below our detection limit (< 1 mug C-CH4 m(-2) h(-1)); no effects of wetting or thawing on CH4 emission rates were observed at any of the sites, A comparison with annual emission rates of N2O and CO2 showed that even a single wetting or thawing event may account for a large proportion of the N2O emission from farmed organic soils.

AB Environmental changes due to global climatic changes will be a major issue for Canada during the 21st century. The effects of new climactic conditions are still difficult to assess. Global Circulation Models (GCM) simulate the effects of increased greenhouse gases on climate, but will need to be supplemented by Regional Climate Models (RCM) since their scale is not quite appropriate. Field controls such as instrumental climate records and glacier mass balance studies help refine model predictions. On a countrywide scale CCM's predict increased temperatures, but these are quite variable on a regional scale. Volume and distribution of wafer will be modified and increased aridity could be critical in some Prairie areas. Extreme events, which are not taken into account by GCMs, could be more frequent, with serious negative effects. Biomes will shift northward and the forest industry will have to adapt its practices quickly. These changes will also affect carbon cycles, due to increased decoy of forest biomass and also drying out of bogs. Warming trends will be even more accute in northern areas, and will provoke permafrost degradation, development of thermokarsts and soil instability. A sea-level rise is anticipated, which will make the coasts of Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia vulnerable to submersion risks. Agriculture will have to adapt to an increased length of growing season, but also to dry spells, much more accute during summer time. The importance of climate change and its impacts on environment are still not well known, which hinders adaptive measures, but some economic sectors cannot really wait for an absolute certainty and must react now, which is the case of the forestry industry. Finally, social issues cannot be ignored. What will be the reaction of the population in the case where government promotes adaptation measures? How will the Canadian population welcome economic/environmental refugees coming from poor countries, which will be more affected than will Canada by climate change, with expected drops in food

AB Climate change and water table drawdown impact the community structure and diversity of peatland soil prokaryotes. Nonetheless, how soil prokaryotes of different water tables respond to climate change remains largely unknown. This study used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to evaluate the variation in soil prokaryotes under scenarios of warming, rainfall reduction, and their combination in different water table peatlands on the Zoige Plateau in China. Stimulated climate change affected some of the diversity indexes and relative abundances of soil prokaryotes in three water table peatlands. Additionally, those from the dry-rewetting event peatland had the most dominant phyla (genera) that showed significant changes in a relative abundance due to the simulated climate change treatments. Regarding functional microbial groups of carbon and nitrogen cycling, simulated climate change did not affect the abundances of the Euryarchaeota, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Methanobacterium in three water table peatlands, except NC10 and Nitrospirae. Redundancy analysis showed that the prokaryotic community variation was primary impacted by site properties of the different water table peatlands rather than the simulated climate change treatments. Moreover, the water table, total carbon, total nitrogen, and soil pH were the primary factors for the overall variation in the soil prokaryotic structure. This study provides a theoretical guidance for management strategies in the Zoige peatland, under climate change scenarios. More attention should be given to the interactive effects of peatland water table drawdown and simulated climate changes for better restorative efforts in water table drawdown, rather than simply adapting to climate change.

TI Not seeing the carbon for the trees? Why area-based targets for
   establishing new woodlands can limit or underplay their climate change
   mitigation benefits
SO LAND USE POLICY

AB Area-based targets for afforestation are a frequent and prominent component of policy discourses on forestry, land use and climate change emissions abatement. Such targets imply an expected contribution of afforestation to the net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, yet the nature of afforestation undertaken and its geographical distribution means that there is considerable uncertainty over the eventual emission reductions outcomes. This uncertainty is reduced if the net carbon balance is calculated for all potential afforestation sites, considering climate, soil characteristics and the possible types of afforestation (species and management regimes). To quantify the range of possible emissions outcomes for area-based afforestation targets, a new spatial analysis method was implemented. This improved the integration of spatial data on antecedent land use with mapped outputs from forest models defining the suitability and productivity of eleven forestry management alternatives. This above ground carbon data was then integrated with outputs from the ECOSSE (Estimation of Carbon in Organic Soils Sequestration and Emissions) model which simulates the soil carbon dynamics. The maps and other model output visualisations combining above and below ground carbon highlight where net carbon surpluses and deficits are likely to occur, how long they persist after afforestation and their relationships with antecedent land use, soils, weather conditions and afforestation management strategies. Using more productive land classes delivers more net sequestration per hectare and could mean greater carbon storage than anticipated by emissions reduction plans. Extensive establishment of lower yielding trees on low-quality ground, with organo-mineral soils could, though, result in net emissions that persist for decades. From the spatial analysis, the range of possible outcomes for any target area of planting is substantial, meaning that outcomes are highly sensitive to policy and implementation decisions on the mix of forestry systems preferred and to spatial targeting or exclusions (both at regional and local scales). The paper highlights the importance of retaining the existing presumption against planting of deep peat areas, but also that additional incentives or constraints may be needed to achieve the aggregate rates of emission mitigation implied by policy commitments. Supplementary carbon storage tonnage targets for new forestry would introduce a floor for carbon sequestration outcomes, but would still allow for flexibility in achieving an appropriate balance in the trade-offs between carbon sequestration and the many other objectives that new woodlands are expected to deliver.

AB Boreal peatlands play a major role in carbon and water cycling and other global environmental processes but understanding this role is constrained by inconsistent representation of peatlands on, or omission from, many global land cover maps. The comparison of several widely used global and continental-scale databases on peatland distribution with a detailed map for the St. Petersburg region of Russia showed significant under-reporting of peatland area, or even total omission. Analysis of the spatial agreement and disagreement with the detailed regional map indicated that the error of comission (overestimation) was significantly lower than the error of omission (underestimation) which means, that overall, peatlands were correctly classified as such in coarse resolution datasets but a large proportion (74-99%) was overlooked. The coarse map resolution alone caused significant omission of peatlands in the study region. In comparison to categorical maps, continuous field mapping approach utilizing MODIS sensor data showed potential for a greatly improved representation of peatlands on coarse resolution maps. Analysis of spectral signatures of peatlands with different types of surface vegetation suggested that improved mapping of boreal peatlands on categorical maps is feasible. The lower reflectance of treeless peatlands in the near- and shortwave-infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum is consistent with the spectral signature of sphagnum mosses. However, when trees are present, the canopy architecture appears to be more important in defining the overall spectral reflectance of peatlands. A research focus on developing remote sensing methods for boreal peatlands is needed for adequate characterization of their global distribution.

TI Identification and classification of unmapped blanket bogs in the

SO MIRES AND PEAT
LA English

DE blanket mire; fen; mesotope; peat depth; wind farms
AB Blanket bogs are rare types of peatland that are recognised internationally for important habitat provision, and nationally and locally as important carbon stores and sinks. These ecosystems enjoy particular attention and protection within the European Union, but gaps highlighted in the Spanish national peatland inventory leave many areas of Spain's blanket bog habitat unprotected and exposed to anthropogenic pressures such as livestock or wind farm development. This research identifies and offers classification of four currently unmapped areas of blanket bog located in the Cordillera Cantabrica (north Spain) on the administrative boundaries between the regions of Cantabria and Castilla y Leon. Peat depth was surveyed on a 15 m spaced grid at all sites and mesotope units were defined from topography and hydrological flow patterns. Two sloping and two mound blanket bogs were identified containing a range of bog and fen mesotope units. Maximum peat depth at the five sites ranges from 1.78 to 2.82 m covering an area of 43 ha of blanket bog (>30 cm peat depth). The survey also estimates that more than 300,000 m(3) of peat has accumulated across all sites. This study adds significantly to the known global distribution of blanket mire and suggests that an urgent update of national peatland inventories is needed more widely, not least in Spain, to identify currently unmapped areas of blanket bog. The approach used here can be employed wherever blanket mires occur in the world to promote their designation and the preservation of peatland diversity and carbon storage.

AB Aims Climate warming and increasing nitrogen (N) deposition have influenced plant nutrient status and thus plant carbon (C) fixation and vegetation composition in boreal peatlands. Phenols, which are secondary metabolites in plants for defense and adaptation, also play important roles in regulating peatland C dynamics due to their anti-decomposition properties. However, how the phenolic levels of different functional types of plants vary depending on nutrient availability remain unclear in boreal peatlands.
   Methods Here, we investigated total phenols contents (TPC) and total tannins contents in leaves of 11 plant species in 18 peatlands of the Great Hing'an Mountains area in northeastern China, and examined their variations with leaf N and phosphorus (P) and underlying mechanisms.
   Important Findings Shrubs had higher TPC than graminoids, indicating less C allocation to defense and less uptake of organic N in faster-growing and nonmycorrhizal graminoids than in slower-growing and mycorrhizal shrubs. For shrubs, leaf TPC decreased with increasing N contents but was not influenced by changing leaf phosphorus (P) contents, which suggested that shrubs would reduce the C investment for defense with increasing N availability. Differently, leaf TPC of graminoids increased with leaf N contents and decreased with leaf P contents. As graminoids are more N-limited and less P-limited, we inferred that graminoids would increase the defensive C investment under increased nutrient availability. We concluded that shrubs would invest more C in growth than in defense with increasing N availability, but it was just opposite for graminoids, which might be an important mechanism to explain the resource competition and encroachment of shrubs in boreal peatlands in the context of climate warming and ever-increasing N deposition.

AB The focus of current water management in drained peatlands is to facilitate optimal drainage, which has led to soil subsidence and a strong increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Dutch land and water authorities proposed the application of subsoil irrigation (SSI) system on a large scale to potentially reduce GHG emissions, while maintaining high biomass production. Based on model results, the expectation was that SSI would reduce peat decomposition in summer by preventing groundwater tables (GWTs) from dropping below -60 cm. In 2017-2018, we evaluated the effects of SSI on GHG emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O) for four dairy farms on drained peat meadows in the Netherlands. Each farm had a treatment site with SSI installation and a control site drained only by ditches (ditch water level -60 / -90 cm, 100 m distance between ditches). The SSI system consisted of perforated pipes -70 cm from surface level with spacing of 5-6 m to improve drainage during winter-spring and irrigation in summer. GHG emissions were measured using closed chambers every 2-4 weeks for CO2, CH4 and N2O. Measured ecosystem respiration (R-eco) only showed a small difference between SSI and control sites when the GWT of SSI sites were substantially higher than the control site (> 20 cm difference). Over all years and locations, however, there was no significant difference found, despite the 6-18 cm higher GWT in summer and 1-20 cm lower GWT in wet conditions at SSI sites. Differences in mean annual GWT remained low (< 5 cm). Direct comparison of measured N2O and CH4 fluxes between SSI and control sites did not show any significant differences. CO2 fluxes varied according to temperature and management events, while differences between control and SSI sites remained small. Therefore, there was no difference between the annual gap-filled net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the SSI and control sites. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was on average 40 and 30 t CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1) in 2017 and 2018 on the SSI sites and 38 and 34 t CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1 )in 2017 and 2018 on the control sites. This lack of SSI effect is probably because the GWT increase remains limited to deeper soil layers (60-120 cm depth), which contribute little to peat oxidation.
   We conclude that SSI modulates water table dynamics but fails to lower annual carbon emission. SSI seems unsuitable as a climate mitigation strategy. Future research should focus on potential effects of GWT manipulation in the uppermost organic layers (-30 cm and higher) on GHG emissions from drained peatlands.

AB Plant communities play a key role in regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in peatland ecosystems and therefore in their ability to act as carbon (C) sinks. However, in response to global change, a shift from Sphagnum-dominated to vascular-plant-dominated peatlands may occur, with a potential alteration in their C-sink function. To investigate how the main GHG fluxes (CO2 and CH4) are affected by a plant community change (shift from dominance of Sphagnum mosses to vascular plants, i.e., Molinia caerulea), a mesocosm experiment was set up. Gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and CH4 emission models were used to estimate the annual C balance and global warming potential under both vegetation covers. While the ER and CH4 emission models estimated an output of, respectively, 376 +/- 108 and 7 +/- 4 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Sphagnum mesocosms, this reached 1018 +/- 362 and 33 +/- 8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in mesocosms with Sphagnum rubellum and Molinia caerulea. Annual modeled GPP was estimated at -414 +/- 122 and -1273 +/- 482 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Sphagnum and Sphagnum + Molinia plots, respectively, leading to an annual CO2 and CH4 budget of -30 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Sphagnum plots and of -223 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Sphagnum + Molinia ones (i.e., a C sink). Even if CH4 emissions accounted for a small part of the gaseous C efflux (ca. 3 %), their global warming potential value makes both plant communities have a climate warming effect. The shift of vegetation from Sphagnum mosses to Molinia caerulea seems beneficial for C sequestration at a gaseous level. However, roots and litter of Molinia caerulea could provide substrates for C emissions that were not taken into account in the short measurement period studied here.

The measurements started on I June, when there was still a 1-2 m cover of dry snow, and ended 26 August at a time that corresponds to late autumn at this high-arctic site. During the 20-day period with snow cover, fluxes Of CO2 to the atmosphere were small, typically 0.005 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) (0.41 gCO(2) m(-2) d(-1)), wheres during the thawed period, the fluxes displayed a clear diurnal variation. During the snow-free period, before the onset of veaetation growth, fluxes of CO2 to the atmosphere were typically 0.1mg,CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in the afternoon and daily sums reached values up to almost 9gCO(2)m(-2) d(-1). After 4 July, downward fluxes Of CO2 increased, and on sunny days in the middle of the growing season, the net ecosystem exchange rates attained typical values of about -0.23 mg m(-2) s(-1) at midday and max values of daily sums of -12gCO(2) m(-2) d(-1). Throughout the measured period the fen ecosystem acted as a net-sink of 130gCO(2) m(-2). Modelling the ecosystem respiration during the season corresponded well with eddy correlation and chamber measurements. On the basis of the eddy correlation data and the predicted respiration effluxes, an estimate of the annual CO2 balance the calender year 1997 was calculated to be a net-sink of 20gCO(2) m(-2) yr(-1).

AB Warming in the boreal forest region has already led to changes in the fire regime. This may result in increasing fire frequency or severity in peatlands, which could cause these ecosystems to shift from a net sink of carbon (C) to a net source of C to the atmosphere. Similar to C cycling, peatlands serve as a net sink for mercury (Hg), which binds strongly to organic matter and accumulates in peat over time. This stored Hg is also susceptible to re-release to the atmosphere during peat fires. Here we investigate the physical properties that influence depth of burn in experimental peat columns and the resulting emissions of CO, CO2, CH4, and gaseous and particulate Hg. As expected, bulk density and soil moisture content were important controls on depth of burn, CO2 emissions, and CO emissions. However, our results show that CH4 and Hg emissions are insensitive to combustion temperature or fuel moisture content. Emissions during the burning of peat, across a wide range of moisture conditions, were associated with low particulate Hg and high gaseous Hg release. Due to strong correlations between total Hg and CO emissions and because high Hg emissions occurred despite incomplete combustion of total C, our results suggest that Hg release during peat burning is governed by the thermodynamics of Hg reduction more so than by the release of Hg associated with peat combustion. Our measured emissions ratios, particularly for CH4: CO2, are higher than values typically used in the upscaling of boreal forest or peatland fire emissions. These emission ratios have important implications not only for our understanding of smouldering chemistry, but also for potential influences of peat fires on the Earth's climate system.

AB Paleosols contain information about the rates of soil organic carbon turnover when the soil was actively forming. However, this temporal information is often difficult to interpret without tight stratigraphic control on the age of the paleosol. Here we apply ramped pyrolysis/oxidation (Ramped PyrOx) C-14 analyses to evaluate age spectra of transgressive early Holocene paleosols from the Mississippi Delta in southeastern Louisiana, USA. We find C-14 age spectra from soil organic matter (SOM) in both paleosols and overlying basal peats that represent variability in age that is close to, or only slightly greater than, analytical uncertainty of C-14 measurements, despite different sources of carbon with likely disparate ages. Such age spectra have not previously been observed in the sedimentary record. Here they indicate vigorous soil carbon turnover prior to burial, which homogenized C-14 ages within SOM across the entire thermochemical spectrum. The weighted bulk C-14 ages from Ramped PyrOx of paleosols and overlying peats are identical within analytical and process-associated uncertainty, and corroborate C-14 ages from charcoal fragments and plant macrofossils from the overlying peat. The youngest ages from Ramped PyrOx age spectra may also potentially be applied as chronometers for stratigraphic burial ages. Our results suggest rapid turnover (<<300 years) of carbon in these soils relative to input of allochthonous carbon, indicating that the C-14 age of different soil components is decoupled from thermochemical stability and instead reflects vigorous turnover processes. The concurrence of paleosol and peat C-14 ages also suggests that pedogenic processes were linked with the development of coastal marshes, and that the priming effect potentially masked the signal of allochthonous carbon inputs during sea level rise.

AB Black spruce forests are a dominant covertype in the boreal forest region, and they inhabit landscapes that span a wide range of hydrologic and thermal conditions. These forests often have large stores of soil organic carbon. Recent increases in temperature at northern latitudes may be stimulating decomposition rates of this soil carbon. It is unclear, however, how changes in environmental conditions influence decomposition in these systems, and if substrate controls of decomposition vary with hydrologic and thermal regime. We addressed these issues by investigating the effects of temperature, moisture, and organic matter chemical characteristics on decomposition of fibric soil horizons from three black spruce forest sites. The sites varied in drainage and permafrost, and included a "Well Drained" site where permafrost was absent, and "Moderately well Drained" and "Poorly Drained" sites where permafrost was present at about 0.5 m depth. Samples collected from each site were incubated at five different moisture contents (2, 25, 50, 75, and 100% saturation) and two different temperatures (10 degrees C and 20 degrees C) in a full factorial design for two months. Organic matter chemistry was analyzed using pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry prior to incubation, and after incubation on soils held at 20 degrees C, 50% saturation. Mean cumulative mineralization, normalized to initial carbon content, ranged from 0.2% to 4.7%, and was dependent on temperature, moisture, and site. The effect of temperature on mineralization was significantly influenced by moisture content, as mineralization was greatest at 20 degrees C and 50-75% saturation. While the relative effects of temperature and moisture were similar for all soils, mineralization rates were significantly greater for samples from the "Well Drained" site compared to the other sites. Variations in the relative abundances of polysaccharide-derivatives and compounds of undetermined source (such as toluene, phenol, 4-methyl phenol, and several unidentifiable compounds) could account for approximately 44% of the variation in mineralization across all sites under ideal temperature and moisture conditions. Based on our results, changes in temperature and moisture likely have similar, additive effects on in situ soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition across a wide range of black spruce forest systems, while variations in SOM chemistry can lead to significant differences in decomposition rates within and among forest sites.

AB Fungi have important roles as decomposers, mycorrhizal root symbionts and pathogens in forest ecosystems, but there is limited information about their diversity and composition at the landscape scale. This work aimed to disentangle the factors underlying fungal richness and composition along the landscape-scale moisture, organic matter and productivity gradients. Using high-throughput sequencing, we identified soil fungi from 54 low-productivity Pinus sylvestris-dominated plots across three study areas in Estonia and determined the main predictors of fungal richness based on edaphic, floristic and spatial variables. Fungal richness displayed unimodal relationship with organic matter and deduced soil moisture. Plant richness and productivity constituted the key predictors for taxonomic richness of functional guilds. Composition of fungi and the main ectomycorrhizal fungal lineages and hyphal exploration types was segregated by moisture availability and soil nitrogen. We conclude that plant productivity and diversity determine the richness and proportion of most functional groups of soil fungi in low-productive pine forests on a landscape scale. Adjacent stands of pine forest may differ greatly in the dominance of functional guilds that have marked effects on soil carbon and nitrogen cycling in these forest ecosystems.

AB Freshwater tropical wetlands are valuable sinks of carbon (C) on the global scale. While much attention has been paid to forested peatlands, little is known about C stored in tropical freshwater mineral soil wetlands dominated by herbaceous and macrophyte vegetation, specially its spatial variability at the ecosystem level. Here we study the soil organic carbon of two tropical lowland wetlands (fluvial and isolated), located in the interandean valley of the Magdalena river in Colombia. Soil cores were extracted from 11 sampling zones distributed in the two wetlands, including the dryland adjacent to each wetland. They were sectioned into 2 cm-depth increments that were analyzed for C content. The average bulk density was higher (P < 0.001) in the fluvial wetland (0.87 +/- 0.3 g cm(-3)) than in the isolated one (0.45 +/- 0.3 g cm(-3)), the concentration of C (% Cr) was higher (P < 0.001) in the isolated wetland (11.1 +/- 6.8%) than in the fluvial one (1.9 +/- 1.1%) as well as the average soil organic carbon (6.4 +/- 2.6 and 2.9 +/- 1.1 t C ha(-1) cm(-1), respectively). Per unit area, the fluvial wetland had about twice as much storage capacity of C as the dryland, while in the isolated wetland the ratio was up to five times higher. Hydrogeomorphology was an important factor for the C storage in these ecosystems. The fluctuating hydrodynamics of the fluvial wetland seems to favor aerobic conditions and thus the prevalence of aerobic over anaerobic decomposition, lowering accumulation of C. This study makes an important contribution towards the understanding of C dynamics in different types of tropical wetlands and brings data to support their conservation.

AB Peatland ecosystems have been consistent carbon (C) sinks for millennia, but it has been predicted that exposure to warmer temperatures and drier conditions associated with climate change will shift the balance between ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration providing a positive feedback to atmospheric CO2 concentration. Our main objective was to determine the sensitivity of ecosystem photosynthesis, respiration and net ecosystem production (NEP) measured by eddy covariance, to variation in temperature and water table depth associated with interannual shifts in weather during 2004-2009. Our study was conducted in a moderately rich treed fen, the most abundant peatland type in western Canada, in a region (northern Alberta) where peatland ecosystems are a significant landscape component. During the study, the average growing season (May-October) water depth declined approximately 38 cm, and temperature [expressed as cumulative growing degree days (GDD, March-October)] varied approximately 370 GDD. Contrary to previous predictions, both ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration showed similar increases in response to warmer and drier conditions. The ecosystem remained a strong net sink for CO2 with an average NEP (+/- SD) of 189 +/- 47 g C m-2 yr-1. The current net CO2 uptake rates were much higher than C accumulation in peat determined from analyses of the relationship between peat age and cumulative C stock. The balance between C addition to, and total loss from, the top 0-30 cm depth (peat age range 0-70 years) of shallow peat cores averaged 43 +/- 12 g C m-2 yr-1. The apparent long-term average rate of net C accumulation in basal peat samples was 19-24 g C m-2 yr-1. The difference between current rates of net C uptake and historical rates of peat accumulation is likely a result of vegetation succession and recent increases in tree establishment and productivity.

AB The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol (KP) have created a clear need for methods that enable accurate accounting of carbon (C) stocks and stock changes in forest ecosystems. The rate of accumulation of C in plantation forests in the Republic of Ireland was estimated for the period 1906-2002 using the record of afforestation and a dynamic C accounting model (C-flow). Projections for the period 2003-2012 were made using different afforestation rates. It was assumed that Sitka spruce planted in the period 1906-1989 was Yield Class (YC) 16 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) and that after 1990 this increased to 20 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1). All other conifers were assumed to have the growth characteristics of YC 8 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) lodgepole pine. Broadleaves were assumed to have the growth characteristics of YC 6 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) beech. In 2002, the total forest C stock was 37.7 Mt C representing an increase of 14.8 Mt C since 1990. In 2002, the rate of increase in trees, products, litter and soil was 0.7, 0.1, 0.1 and 0.5 Mt C, respectively. Under a business-as-usual scenario, afforestation since 1990 is estimated to create an annual average C sink of 0.9 Mt C year(-1) during the period 2008-2012. This accounts for similar to 22 per cent of Ireland's reduction commitment under the KP. Afforestation on peat soils was found to reduce the net C sink, although the extent to which it does so is highly dependent on assumptions regarding the rate of peat C loss.

AB In boreal peatlands, the aboveground (plant) and belowground (microbial) communities are acutely linked because the whole soil profile is partially decomposed plant matter (peat), and dictates the nutrients available to the belowground system. We characterized the aboveground and belowground communities in two boreal peatlands: a Sphagnum-dominated fen and a Carex-dominated fen. We link the plant and microbial communities by observing plant, litter and peat carbon and nitrogen values. The Sphagnum-dominated fen had greater plant diversity but provided low quality litter inputs (high carbon:nitrogen) that formed peat and that corresponded with greater fungi:bacteria and Gram-positive:Gram-negative bacteria microbial community compared to the Carex-dominated fen. The higher quality plant inputs in the Carex-dominated fen supported a 5 x greater microbial biomass that was also 2 x more active (as measure by CO2 production). In this approach we highlight that peatlands and their component plant and microbial communities play-out along a common resource-spectrum that dictates 'fast' vs 'slow' carbon and nutrient cycling (i.e., a plant-soil interaction spectrum) that can, in turn, affect carbon storage potential. As peatland plant community composition is predicted to shift and decomposition rates are expected to increase under climate change, our work highlights the importance of understanding plant-soil microbial interactions.

AB Determination of the gas diffusion coefficient D-s of peat soils is essential to understand the mechanisms of soil gas transport in peatlands, which have been one of major potential sources of gaseous carbons. In the present study, we aimed at determining the D-s of peat soils for various values of the air-filled porosity a and we tested the validity of the Three-Porosity Model (Moldrup et al. 2004) and the Millington-Quirk model (1961) for predicting the relative gas diffusivity, the ratio of D-s to D-0 the gas diffusion coefficient in free air. Undisturbed peat soil cores were sampled from aerobic layers in the Bibai mire, Hokkaido, Japan. The MQ model reproduced the measured D-s/D-0 curves better than the TPM. The TPM, a predictive model for undisturbed mineral soils, overestimated the D-s/D-0 values for peat soils, implying that in the peat soils the pore pathways were more tortuous than those in the mineral soils. Since the changes in the D-s/D-0 ratios with the a values of a well-decomposed black peat soil tended to be more remarkable than those of other high-moor peat soils, the existence of a positive feedback mechanism was assumed, such that peat soil decomposition itself would increase the soil gas diffusivity and promote soil respiration.

AB The Changbai Mountain range is a well-known and important mountain chain in northeast China, bordering the Korean Peninsula in the south. It is also one of the areas most sensitive to global change. Massive peatlands that play a key role in the global carbon (C) cycle are found in this region. Estimating and assessing C dynamics in Changbai Mountain peatlands is of great importance to local sustainable development. Dry bulk density and C content analyses based on 8 selected peat cores dated by Pb-210 were used to estimate recent rates of carbon accumulation (RERCA, g C m(-2) yr(-1)) in Changbai Mountain peatlands. RERCA ranged from 124.2 to 292.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (average 199.6 +/- 60.9 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Obvious increasing trends in RERCA were observed in all peat cores. The C pool for 200 years was 38.5-52.1 kg C m(-2), which can supplement the database of C pools for Changbai Mountain ecosystems. The Pb-210 radiometric technique was tested and found to be a useful study method for recent terrestrial carbon sequestration. This study could contribute to a better understanding of rarely studied mountain peatlands in China and may be useful to global mountain and climate change research.

AB Methane (CH4) production varies greatly among different types of peatlands along an ombrotrophic-minerotrophic hydrogeomorphic gradient. pH is thought to be a dominant control over observed differences in CH4 production across sites, and previous pH manipulation experiments have verified the inhibitory effect of low pH on CH4 production. In this experiment, we asked (i) if the major effect of low pH is direct inhibition of one or both pathways of methanogenesis and/or inhibition of 'upstream' fermentation that provides substrates for methanogens, and (ii) to what extent is pH sufficient to explain differences in CH4 production relative to other factors that co-vary across the gradient. To address these questions, we adjusted the pH of peat slurries from 6 peatlands to 4 levels (3.5, 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5) that reflected their range of native pH, maintained these pH levels over a 43-day anaerobic laboratory incubation, and measured a suite of responses within the anaerobic carbon cycle. Higher pH caused a significant increase in CO2 production in all sites. Regardless of site, time, and pH level, the reduction of inorganic electron acceptors contributed to <12% of total CO2 production. Higher pH caused acetate pooling by Day 7, but this effect was greater in the more ombrotrophic sites and lasted throughout the incubation, whereas acetate was almost completely consumed as a substrate for acetoclastic methanogenesis by Day 43 in the minerotrophic sites. Higher pH also enhanced CH4 production and this process was up to 436% more sensitive to changes in pH than CO2 production. However, across all sites and pH levels, CH4 production accounted for <25% of the total gaseous C production. Fermentation appeared to be the main pathway for anaerobic C mineralization. Our results indicate that low pH inhibits CH4 production through direct inhibition of both methanogenesis pathways and indirectly through its effects on fermentation, but the direct effects are stronger. The inability of acetoclastic methanogenesis to fully compensate for acetate pooling in ombrotrophic peats at higher pH suggests that CH4 production is inhibited by some factor(s) in addition to pH in these sites. We examine a variety of other potential inhibitory mechanisms and postulate that humic substances may provide an important inhibitory effect over CH4 production in ombrotrophic peatlands.

AB Boreal and subarctic peatlands may become increasingly used for wastewater tertiary treatment. Colleagues added simulated secondarily-treated wastewater to a subarctic ladder fen over two growing seasons. We examined how carbon storage and nutrient relations changed for key Sphagnum species. We measured the productivity, decomposition, nutrient content, C:N and N:P ratios of Sphagnum species on ridges and pool edges, and the nutrient relations of a third Sphagnum species in pools, compared to a control fen. Closer to the point source, S. fuscum on ridges had a 2-fold increase in productivity, and Sphagnum rubellum along pond edges had a 4 to 12-fold increase in productivity, but areas beyond 50 m downgradient were not affected. The decomposition of S. fuscum did not change, and S. rubellum showed only a slight increase close to the point source. Consequently, net carbon storage increased in Sphagnum within <50 m of the point source. Nutrient effects were apparent in the pools and pool margins, whereas ridges were hardly affected. N:P was the most sensitive nutrient parameter, increasing within 50 m. In the short-term, subarctic peatlands exposed to simulated secondarily-treated wastewater increased their carbon storage. Ridges in string fens were most resilient to nutrient amendments.

AB Sustainable development of land use is determined by changes of the regional supply of Land Use Functions (LUFs) and the demand of future societal land use claims. LUFs are based on the ecosystem services concept, but more adapted to human land use. In this paper, we assessed two peatland-use scenarios towards sustainable development in Northeast Germany in order to understand their impacts on LUFs and land use claims. For this, we extended an analytical framework designed to confront LUFs with land use claims identified in multi-level stakeholder strategies in a participatory manner. The sustainability assessment was performed with peatland-use scenarios "Services for services" and "Market determines usage" that favoured environmental and economic land use claims, respectively. Findings revealed possible trade-offs between land use claims for biomass production and regional value creation as well as for peatlands" carbon and nutrient sink, and habitat functions. The core achievement is an extended sustainability assessment framework integrating land use demands of multi-level stakeholder strategies into participatory impact assessment, in a way that land use claims serve as benchmarks for LUFs. This facilitates the understanding of sustainable land use in both supply and demand perspective, and the normative evaluation of ecosystem services.

AB This work describes laboratory experiments aimed at evaluating the feasibility of removing heavy metals from metal-contaminated water in flow-through microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) with peat moss as a source of organic carbon. MECs were assembled in upflow glass columns containing granular activated carbon (GAC) bioelectrodes preceded by a layer of peat moss. The MECs were fed with metal-contaminated surface water collected at a firing range. At hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 4-6 days, up to 99 % removal of Pb, Zn, Cu, and Fe was observed. The removal efficiency of Zn and Cu declined at an HRT of 1.7 days, while effluent Pb concentration remained below the detection limit for all of the HRTs tested. Metal extraction from MEC compartments showed an accumulation of metals in both the peat moss layer and the GAC cathode, i.e., the removal was achieved by a combination of anaerobic and bioelectrochemical pathways of metal reduction. A proliferation of sulphate reducing bacteria in the peat moss layer and electroactive species in GAC electrodes was confirmed by biomolecular analysis. The proposed flow-through system, which combines sulphate-reducing and electroactive microbial activities to achieve near-complete metal removal, can be used for removing a broad range of heavy metals from contaminated water in a low-cost passive flow treatment system.

AB P>Climate change in cold biomes not only involves higher summer temperatures, but also warmer springs and more winter precipitation. So far, little is known about species responses to these seasonal components of climate change.
   We experimentally manipulated spring and summer temperatures and winter snow accumulation and temperatures independently in a peatland in sub-arctic Sweden. This yielded six climate scenarios and we studied the responses of the peat moss Sphagnum fuscum, the evergreen dwarf shrubs Empetrum hermaphroditum and Andromeda polifolia, the deciduous dwarf shrubs Betula nana and Vaccinium uliginosum, the grass Calamagrostis lapponica and the forb Rubus chamaemorus.
   We found substantial interspecific differences in leaf nutrient and carbon exchange variables that reflect the response of tundra plants to climate change. S. fuscum had the lowest N and P concentrations, with increasing N and P concentrations (and decreasing C/N and C/P ratios) going from evergreen dwarf shrubs, to the grass, deciduous dwarf shrubs and the forb. Leaf N/P ratios varied between 10 and 14 which points to N-limited plant growth.
   The natural abundance of N-15 varied very strongly among species and growth forms. These differences corresponded with the presence and type of mycorrhizal association in the plant roots. Leaf carbon isotope discrimination also differed strongly among species and growth forms, but the absolute differences were relatively small (< 5 parts per thousand). The rank order was: forb and graminoid < moss and evergreen shrubs < deciduous shrubs.
   After 4 years, the effects of realistic climate change manipulations on leaf nutrient and carbon exchange variables were idiosyncratic with respect to species and generally small compared to the differences among species and growth forms. At the phenotypic level, spring warming or winter snow addition effects occurred as frequently as summer warming effects.
   This implies that the changes in the species composition and structure of plant communities that have been observed in medium-term warming studies in cold biomes will have much more impact on plant-mediated nutrient and carbon cycling pathways and rates than climate-change induced phenotypic responses, irrespective of the seasonal timing of these climate changes.

AB Permanent grasslands constitute the most widespread land use type for agriculturally managed peatlands in Europe. They are typically significant sources of CO2 to the atmosphere as a result of drainage-induced peat decomposition, but quantitative data are still scarce. This study presents an in-depth analysis of CO2 flux variability at the site (n=3) and plot scale (n=9) for different Danish permanent grasslands on peat. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and ecosystem respiration were monitored over one year with closed dynamic chambers. The first part of the data analysis consisted of a detailed evaluation of the flux dataset to gain insight into the potential effects of fast fluctuations in the wind and light intensity on the plot scale CO2 flux. In the second part of the analysis, gross photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration were modeled on the field and plot scale with candidate sets of simple light and temperature response models commonly applied in ecological studies. The detailed flux dataset analysis revealed that upward concave flux curves, which are not explainable by diffusion theory, can either be the result of a fan-induced increase in headspace turbulence, or of a photosynthesis overshoot into shaded or darkened chamber measurement periods. Instead of discarding such measurements from the dataset, this study proposes the use of linear flux calculation as a way to obtain less biased flux rate estimates. For the carbon balance modeling, it could be shown that annual NEE estimates for a site differ (0.2-0.3 kg CO2 m(-2)) between different models available for gap-filling CO2 flux time series even when the models were equally suitable according to statistical evaluation. Overall, all plots showed significant carbon losses over the course of a year (1.5-5.6 kg CO2 m(-2), including harvested aboveground biomass); however, it was not possible to relate spatial differences in the CO2 flux dynamics between and within the study sites to certain peat properties or management types due to high uncertainties in the annual estimates.

AB Rewetted, previously drained fens often remain sources rather than sinks for carbon and nutrients. To date, it is poorly understood which soil characteristics stimulate carbon and nutrient mobilization upon rewetting. Here, we assess the hypothesis that a large pool of iron in the soil negatively affects fen restoration success, as flooding-induced iron reduction (Fe3+ to Fe2+) causes a disproportionate breakdown of organic matter that is coupled with a release of inorganic compounds. We collected intact soil cores in two iron-poor and two iron-rich drained fens, half of which were subjected to a rewetting treatment while the other half was kept drained. Prolonged drainage led to the mobilization of nitrate (NO3-, > 1 mmol L-1) in all cores, regardless of soil iron content. In the rewetted iron-rich cores, a sharp increase in pore water iron (Fe) concentrations correlated with concentrations of inorganic carbon (TIC, > 13 mmol L-1) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC, > 16 mmol L-1). Additionally, ammonium (NH4+) accumulated up to phytotoxic concentrations of 1 mmol L-1 in the pore water of the rewetted iron-rich cores. Disproportionate mobilization of Fe, TIC, DOC and NH4+ was absent in the rewetted iron-poor cores, indicating a strong interaction between waterlogging and iron-mediated breakdown of organic matter. Concentrations of dissolved phosphorus (P) rose slightly in all cores upon rewetting, but remained low throughout the experiment. Our results suggest that large pools of iron in the top soil of drained fens can hamper the restoration of the fen's sink-service for ammonium and carbon upon rewetting. We argue that negative effects of iron should be most apparent in fens with fluctuating water levels, as temporary oxygenation allows frequent regeneration of Fe3+. We conclude that rewetting of iron-poor fens may be more feasible for restoration.

AB A much improved understanding of how water-table fluctuations near the surface affect decomposition and preservation of peat-forming plant litter and surficial peats is needed in order to predict possible feedbacks between the peatland carbon cycle and the global climate system. In this study peatland plants (bryophytes and vascular plants), their litter and peat cores were collected from the Ryggmossen peatland in the boreonemoral zone of central Sweden. The extracted insoluble residues from whole plant tissues were depolymerized using thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) in the presence of both unlabelled and C-13-labelled tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) which yielded both vascular plant-and Sphagnum-derived phenols. Methylated 4-isopropenylphenol (IUPAC: 1-methoxy-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)benzene), methylated cis-and trans-3-(4'-hydroxyphen-1-yl)but-2-enoic acid (IUPAC: (E/Z)-methyl 3-(4-methoxyphenyl)but-2-enoate), and methylated 3-(4'-hydroxyphen-1-yl)but-3-enoic acid (IUPAC: methyl 3-(4-methoxyphenyl)but-3-enoate) (van der Heijden et al., 1997) are confirmed as TMAH thermochemolysis products of "bound" sphagnum acid and also as being specific to Sphagnum mosses. These putative biomarkers were also significant components in the unlabelled TMAH thermochemolysis products from the depolymerization of ultrasonically extracted samples from eight peat cores, one from a hummock and one from a hollow at each of the four stages along the bog plateau-to-swamp forest gradient. We have proposed and measured two parameters namely (i) sigma which is defined as the total amount of these four molecules normalised to 100 mg of OC; and (ii) an index (SR%) which is the ratio of sigma to the K parameter giving a measure of the relative amounts of "bound" sphagnum acid to the "bound" vascular plant phenols in peat moss and the surficial peat layers. Changes in sigma and SR% down the bog plateau (BP), bog margin (BM) and fen lagg (FL) cores in the Ryggmossen mire indicates that the sphagnum acid bound into the peat is being degraded in the unsaturated and seasonally-saturated layers. There is then a stabilisation of Sphagnum-derived phenols in the deepest horizons of the seasonally-saturated layer and into the permanently-saturated layer. These results suggest that "bound" sphagnum acid will be stabilised in peatlands shifting to a wetter and more variable precipitation regime whereas it will be gradually stripped away (e. g. by hydrolysis/enzymatic activity) in surficial peats shifting to a drier climate, such that any subsequent rewetting of the peat could lead to anaerobic hydrolysis and fermentation of the newly exposed carbohydrates. This highlights the sensitivity of Sphagnum surficial peats to climate-induced changes in water levels albeit there may be differences in the extent of degradation along the bog-fen gradient.

AB Subarctic peatlands are rich sources of organic carbon for freshwater ecosystems. Where those peatlands are underlain by permafrost, permafrost thaw may cause an initial release of bioavailable dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to surrounding freshwaters. In this study, we measured icebound and potentially leachable (extracted) DOC quantities and indices of DOC quality in active layer and permafrost layers from two subarctic peat mires, Stord-alen and Storflaket. Most of the permafrost layers did not contain more organic matter or exportable DOC (as g kg(-1) dry soil) than the overlying active layer, and there was no difference in aromaticity, molecular weight, or the ratio between labile and recalcitrant DOC extracted from the permafrost and active layer. However, DOC held in segregated ice of the near-surface permafrost had relatively low aromaticity compared to extracted DOC from the same depth. Total icebound and potentially leachable DOC in the Stordalen mire permafrost that is predicted to experience active layer deepening during each of the next 50 years corresponded to about 0.1% of the current annual aquatic export of DOC from the mire. We conclude that the pool of potentially leachable DOC currently stored in permafrost layers is small. We also highlight differences in permafrost organic material between the two studied mire systems, which has an effect on the pool and properties of leachable DOC that is potentially available for export during thaw. Moreover, the geomorphological form of permafrost thaw will influence future hydrological connectedness and DOC production, in turn determining future DOC export from the mires.

AB Peatland rewetting is a widely used restoration technique, yet the recovery of anaerobic processes is poorly characterized. Microbes involved in anaerobic processes, especially methanogens, could reflect the stabilization of anaerobic conditions, vegetation succession and overall restoration success.
   We investigated the effect of long-term drainage and hydrological rewetting on methanogenic abundance, community composition and CH4 production potential in bogs and spruce swamp forests. Additionally, the substrate limitation of methanogens was tested with a focus on original peatland plant species and their spreading after rewetting by addition of natural substrates.
   Drainage strongly reduced the abundance and diversity of the methanogenic community. After rewetting, methanogenic abundance and community composition reached almost a pristine-like state, however their CH4 production remained as low as in the drained sites. Substrate addition confirmed the substrate limitation of methanogens due to strongly decomposed peat and the slow spreading of original peatland vegetation. The addition of natural substrates supported methanogenesis close to a pristine-like level. The limited CH4 production reflected not fully recovered anaerobic microbial community composition and vegetation structure 7-16 years after rewetting, although anaerobic conditions seemed to stabilize. Thus, the reestablishment of peatland vegetation structure is crucial for the recovery of methanogenic activity and microbial processes in rewetted peatlands. Moreover, methanogenic community composition, abundance and activity could be used as indicators of restoration success.
   Originality significant statement: Peatland drainage is increasingly recognized as a major problem affecting the status of valuable natural habitats, water quality and global carbon balance. Rewetting projects are set up to combat and mitigate the losses; yet not enough is known about the recovery of anaerobic processes, especially methanogenesis, which are assumed to reflect stabilization of anaerobic conditions and overall restoration success. Forestry-drained spruce swamp forests and bogs, common in northern Europe, are currently rewetted for both nature conservation purposes and for their anticipated function as hydrological buffers, but information on the recovery of anaerobic microbial communities and especially methanogens are only partly known.
   Our study concerns the effect of long-term drainage and hydrological rewetting on methanogenic abundance, community composition and activity (CH4 production potential) in undrained, drained and rewetted bogs and spruce swamp forests in the Bohemian Forest, Central Europe. We searched for a reason of limited methanogenic activity in rewetted sites by addition of natural substrates simulating the spreading of original peatland plants (Sphagnum, sedges). This paper contributes to scientific understanding on how long it takes for rewetted peatlands to recover anaerobic microbial communities, anaerobic processes and what are the crucial factors in this process. These results provides a basis for further studies on the trophic relations between anaerobic microbes and recovery of the drained peatlands after rewetting. This study can also extend a set of indicators which should be use for restoration progress evaluation.

AB A field-scale experiment was conducted to evaluate organic carbon amendment of mine tailings as a technique for pore water and drainage treatment. Six test cells were constructed by amending sulfide- and carbonate- rich tailings with varied mixtures of peat, spent-brewing grain and municipal biosolids. Samples were collected for microbial, geochemical and mineralogical analysis approximately three years after commencing this experiment. Test cells amended with spent-brewing grain promoted sulfate reduction and effective removal of sulfate and metal(loid)s. The addition of municipal biosolids did not sustain enhanced sulfidogenesis after three years, and peat was an ineffective source of organic carbon. Terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism revealed that test cells which supported sulfidogenesis exhibited the greatest microbial diversity. Indigenous bacteria identified using molecular and cultivation analyses were found to be related to Cellulomonas, Thiobacillus, Bacteroides, Paludibacter and Desulfovibrio, which was the only sulfate-reducing bacterial (SRB) isolated. The results demonstrate that mixtures of solid organic materials which supported complex anaerobic microbial communities, including sulfate- reducing bacteria, were most effective in promoting pore-water treatment.

AB Bacteria play a key role in freshwater biogeochemical cycling, but long-term trends in freshwater bacterial community composition and dynamics are not yet well characterized. We used a multiyear time series of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data from eight bog lakes to census the freshwater bacterial community and observe annual and seasonal trends in abundance. The sites that we studied encompassed a range of water column mixing frequencies, which we hypothesized would be associated with trends in alpha and beta diversity. Each lake and layer contained a distinct bacterial community, with distinct levels of richness and indicator taxa that likely reflected the environmental conditions of each lake type sampled, including Actinobacteria in polymictic lakes (i.e., lakes with multiple mixing events per year), Methylophilales in dimictic lakes (lakes with two mixing events per year, usually in spring and fall), and "Candidatus Omnitrophica" in meromictic lakes (lakes with no recorded mixing events). The community present during each year at each site was also surprisingly unique. Despite unexpected interannual variability in community composition, we detected a core community of taxa found in all lakes and layers, including Actinobacteria tribe acI-B2 and Betaprotobacteria lineage PnecC. Although trends in abundance did not repeat annually, each freshwater lineage within the communities had a consistent lifestyle, defined by persistence, abundance, and variability. The results of our analysis emphasize the importance of long-term multisite observations, as analyzing only a single year of data or one lake would not have allowed us to describe the dynamics and composition of these freshwater bacterial communities to the extent presented here.
   IMPORTANCE Lakes are excellent systems for investigating bacterial community dynamics because they have clear boundaries and strong environmental gradients. The results of our research demonstrate that bacterial community composition varies by year, a finding which likely applies to other ecosystems and has implications for study design and interpretation. Understanding the drivers and controls of bacterial communities on long time scales would improve both our knowledge of fundamental properties of bacterial communities and our ability to predict community states. In this specific ecosystem, bog lakes play a disproportionately large role in global carbon cycling, and the information presented here may ultimately help refine carbon budgets for these lakes. Finally, all data and code in this study are publicly available. We hope that this will serve as a resource for anyone seeking to answer their own microbial ecology questions using a multiyear time series.

AB A prominent, middle Miocene (17.5-13.5 Ma) carbon isotope excursion ubiquitously recorded in carbonate sediments has been attributed to enhanced marine productivity and sequestration of C-13 depleted organic carbon in marine sediments or enhanced carbon burial in peat/lignite deposits on land. Here we test the hypothesis that the marine delta C-13 record reflects a change in productivity with proxy records from three Atlantic Ocean sites (Deep Sea Drilling Program Site 608 and Ocean Drilling Program Sites 925 and 1265). Our multiproxy approach is based on benthic foraminiferal accumulation rates, elemental ratios (Ba/Al and P/Al), the delta C-13 of bulk sedimentary organic matter, and dissolution indices. We compare these proxies to benthic foraminiferal delta C-13 values measured on the same samples. Our results indicate that marine paleoproductivity in the Atlantic Ocean is not related to the benthic foraminiferal delta C-13 excursion. A numerical box model confirms that marine productivity cannot account for the delta C-13 maximum. The model shows that sequestration of 1.5 x 10(18) mol C in the terrestrial realm over a period of 3 Ma leads to a 0.9 parts per thousand delta C-13 increase in the deep ocean, which is near the observed records. Therefore, an increase in continental organic carbon sequestration is the most plausible way to enrich the ocean's carbon pool with C-13, which is consistent with coeval lignite deposits worldwide. The delta C-13 values of bulk sedimentary organic matter parallel the delta C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon as reflected by benthic foraminiferal delta C-13 values suggesting no significant change in atmospheric pCO(2) levels over the investigated period.

AB Besides water vapour, greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, O-3 and N2O contribute similar to 60%, 20%, 10% and 6% to global warming, respectively; minor contribution is made by chlorofluorocarbons and volatile organic compounds (VOC). We present CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes from natural and relatively unmanaged soil-plant ecosystems (the ecosystems minimally disturbed by direct human or human- induced activities). All natural ecosystems are net sinks for CO2, although tundra and wetlands (including peatlands) are large sources of CH4, whereas significant N2O emissions occur mainly from tropical and temperate forests. Most natural ecosystems decrease net global warming potential (GWP) from - 0.03 +/- 0.35 t CO2-eha(-1) y(-1) (tropical forests) to - 0.90 +/- 0.42 t CO2-e ha(-1) y(-1) (temperate forests) and - 1.18 +/- 0.44 t CO2-e ha(-1) y(-1) (boreal forests), mostly as CO2 sinks in phytobiomass, microbial biomass and soil C. But net GWP contributions from wetlands are very large, which is primarily due to CH4 emissions. Although the tropical forest system provides a large carbon sink, the negligible capacity of tropical forests to reduce GWP is entirely due to N2O emissions, possibly from rapid N mineralisation under favourable temperature and moisture conditions. It is estimated that the natural ecosystems reduce the net atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 3.55 +/- 0.44 GtCO(2)-ey(-1) or similar to 0.5 ppm(v) CO2-e y(-1), hence, the significant role of natural and relatively unmanaged ecosystems in slowing global warming and climate change. However, the impact of increasing N deposition on natural ecosystems is poorly understood, and further understanding is required regarding the use of drainage as a management tool, to reduce CH4 emissions from wetlands and to increase GHG sink from the restoration of degraded lands, including saline and sodic soils. Data on GHG fluxes from natural and relatively unmanaged ecosystems are further compounded by large spatial and temporal heterogeneity, limited sensitivity of current instruments, few and poor global distribution of monitoring sites and limited capacity of models that could integrate GHG fluxes across ecosystems, atmosphere and oceans and include feedbacks from biophysical variables governing these fluxes.

AB This study uses the extensive monitoring datasets of the Environment Agency of England and Wales to calculate the flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC); particulate organic carbon (POC); and excess dissolved CO2 through English and Welsh rivers. The innovation of this study's approach is to account for the losses of carbon within the fluvial system as well as fluxes at the catchment outlet. In order to make this assessment this study considers: the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) as a measure of the degradation of DOC; and the dissolved CO2 concentration of groundwater as calculated and apportioned into surface waters on the basis of Ca concentrations. The study shows that the best estimate of carbon export, via rivers, from England and Wales is 10.34 Mg C/km(2)/year, with 4.19 Mg C/km(2)/year of this going to the atmosphere. The mapping of the carbon export shows that there are regional hotspots of carbon export and in a small number of cases rivers could be net sinks of carbon due to their low dissolved CO2 content relative to the atmosphere. The flux calculated by this approach is probably still an underestimate of the carbon flux through fluvial systems but the scale of the export is greater than that previously reported and there is evidence that the fluvial flux of carbon is increasing on a decadal scale.

AB An iron-nitrogen co-doped hollow carbon sphere (FeN-HCS) with a mesoporous structure is designed and prepared via simple pyrolysis of melamine on the surface of Fe3O4 nanospheres. In the reaction, Fe3O4 nanospheres are used both as templates for catalyzing the growth of carbon shells and iron sources to form ORR active sites. The FeN-HCS catalyst obtained exhibits extremely high oxygen reduction activity in an alkaline medium with a half-wave potential of 0.834 V (vs. RHE), which is 5 mV more positive than a Pt/ C catalyst, and shifts negatively by only 6 mV after accelerated degradation tests (ADT). Moreover, the FeN-HCS catalyst shows a clear 4-electron reduction pathway and a high methanol tolerance. The outstanding performance of FeN-HCS can be attributed to its unique hierarchical porous hollow shell structure, which maximizes exposure of active sites and enhances mass transfer. Such a synthetic strategy offers a novel route to prepare functional hollow carbon spheres for energy storage and conversion applications.

AB Understanding within-species variability in terpenoid content and composition is highly relevant for predicting species adaptive potential to biotic stresses, but there is still limited information on terpene variations even for widespread species. We studied the foliage content and composition of terpenoids, foliage structure, and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in Pinus sylvestris L. in four Estonian sites ranging from dry forest to raised bog. In the bogs, samples were taken along the environmental gradient from drier margins towards wetter central parts. A chiral column was used to gain insight into the variation in terpene composition. We hypothesized that terpene contents increase and the composition becomes more diverse in more strongly N-limited sites (greater C/N ratio) and that terpene signatures cluster together in sub-sites with similar conditions (drier/wetter). Altogether 37 terpenes were quantified across the sites. Extremely large variability of terpene contents, 48-62% for monoterpenes and 61-89% for sesquiterpenes, was observed. According to the amounts of alpha-pinenes and (+)-3-carene, we distinguished two different 'pine chemotypes'. Contrary to the hypothesis, terpene contents and variability were the greatest in the dry site with the lowest C/N ratio. However, individual terpenoids correlated differently with C or N in different sites, indicating site effects on terpene composition. Moreover, correlations between the terpenoids and C or N depended on the pine chemotype. The sub-sites with different water regime were more strongly clustered together within the site than across the sites. The study demonstrates extensive variations in terpene contents and composition among the populations and over short spatial distances within the populations, suggesting a large among- and within-population adaptive capacity of P. sylvestris.

AB To improve understanding and prediction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources and fluxes in northern peat-dominated catchments, we present the development and application of a parsimonious tracer-aided rainfall-runoff model coupled with a biogeochemistry subroutine able to concurrently simulate streamflow and DOC dynamics. The modeling approach which included quantitative assessment of associated uncertainties was conditioned by geochemical tracers which discriminate dominant water sources. Integration of DOC was predicated on statistical time series models which identified air temperature and streamflow as the key proxies that capture DOC supply and transport processes in two upland catchments in Scotland, UK. Conceptualizing the nonlinear partitioning of quick near-surface and slower groundwater runoff sources in combination with a DOC mass balance resulted in a coupled, low-parameter mechanistic model. Model tests showed mostly sensitive parameters and reasonable simulation results with seasonally controlled DOC supply and event-based DOC transport. Transport is facilitated even for smaller events by overland flow from saturated histosols connected to the stream network. However, during prolonged dry periods, near-surface runoff switches off and stream DOC is dominated by low concentration groundwaters. Furthermore, the model was able to explain subtle differences in DOC dynamics between the two catchments mainly reflecting the distribution of saturated soils and available storage. We conclude that tracers and statistical time series models can successfully guide the development of parsimonious yet structurally consistent water quality models. Parsimonious models provide tools for estimating DOC dynamics and loads with reduced uncertainty and potentially greater transferability.

AB Peatlands are interesting as a carbon storage option, but are also natural emitters of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Phragmites peatlands are particularly interesting due to the global abundance of this wetland plant (Phragmites australis) and the highly efficient internal gas transport mechanism, which is called humidity-induced convection (HIC). The research aims were to (1) clarify how this plant-mediated gas transport influences the CH4 fluxes, (2) which other environmental variables influence the CO2 and CH4 fluxes, and (3) whether Phragmites peatlands are a net source or sink of greenhouse gases. CO2 and CH4 fluxes were measured with the eddy covariance technique within a Phragmites-dominated fen in southwest Germany. One year of flux data (March 2013-February 2014) shows very clear diurnal and seasonal patterns for both CO2 and CH4. The diurnal pattern of CH4 fluxes was only visible when living, green reed was present. In August the diurnal cycle of CH4 was the most distinct, with 11 times higher midday fluxes (15.7 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) than night fluxes (1.41 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). This diurnal cycle has the highest correlation with global radiation, which suggests a high influence of the plants on the CH4 flux. But if the cause were the HIC, it would be expected that relative humidity would correlate stronger with CH4 flux. Therefore, we conclude that in addition to HIC, at least one additional mechanism must be involved in the creation of the convective flow within the Phragmites plants. Overall, the fen was a sink for carbon and greenhouse gases in the measured year, with a total carbon uptake of 221 g Cm-2 yr(-1) (26% of the total assimilated carbon). The net uptake of greenhouse gases was 52 gCO(2) eq.m(-2) yr(-1), which is obtained from an uptake of CO2 of 894 gCO(2) eq.m(-2) yr(-1) and a release of CH4 of 842 gCO(2) eq.m(-2) yr(-1).

AB 1. The response of northern tundra plant communities to warming temperatures is of critical concern because permafrost ecosystems play a key role in global carbon (C) storage, and climate-induced ecological shifts in the plant community will affect the transfer of carbon-dioxide between biological and atmospheric pools.
   2. This study, which focuses on the response of tundra plant growth and phenology to experimental warming, was conducted at the Carbon in Permafrost Experimental Heating Research project, located in the northern foothills of the Alaska Range. We used snow fences coupled with spring snow removal to increase deep-soil temperatures and thaw depth (winter warming), and open-top chambers to increase summer air temperatures (summer warming).
   3. Winter warming increased wintertime soil temperature (5-40 cm) by 2.3 degrees C, resulting in a 10% increase in growing season thaw depth. Summer warming significantly increased growing season air temperature; peak temperature differences occurred near midday when summer warming plots were approximately 1.0 degrees C warmer than ambient plots.
   4. Changes in the soil environment as a result of winter warming treatment resulted in a 20% increase in above-ground biomass and net primary productivity (ANPP), while there was no detected summer warming effect on ecosystem-level ANPP or biomass. Both summer and winter warming extended the growing season through earlier bud break and delayed senescence, despite equivalent snow-free days across treatments. As with ANPP, winter warming increased canopy N mass by 20%, while there was no summer warming effect on canopy N.
   5. The warming-mediated increase in N availability, coupled with phenological shifts, may have driven higher rates of ANPP in the winter warming plots, and the lack of ecosystem-level N and ANPP response to summer warming suggest continued N limitation in the summer warming plots.
   6. Synthesis: These results highlight the role of soil and permafrost dynamics in regulating plant response to climate change and provide evidence that warming may promote greater C accumulation in tundra plant biomass. While warming temperatures are expected to enhance microbial decomposition of the large pool of organic matter stored in tundra soils and permafrost, these respiratory losses may be offset, at least in part, by warming-mediated increases in plant growth.

AB Samples from two lignite seams (Lower Seam, Upper Seam) of the Lavanttal basin (Austria) and additional xylite were investigated for variations in maceral composition, petrography-based facies indicators, bulk geochemical parameters, and molecular composition of hydrocarbons. Both seams originated in a topogenous mire and evolved within a transgressive setting. The final drowning of the mire is indicated by sapropelic shales. Whereas the sapropelic shale overlying the Lower Seam was deposited in a freshwater lake, the sapropelic shale above the Upper Seam represents a brackish lake.
   Numerous relationships are found between petrography-based facies indicators and the geochemical composition of organic matter. The contents of macerals of the liptinite group are positively correlated with soluble organic matter (SOM) yields and hydrogen index (HI). Consistent with maceral composition and high HI values, enhanced proportions of short-chain n-alkanes, which are predominantly found in algae and microorganisms, are obtained from samples of the sapropelic shales. The final drowning of the mire is reflected by decreasing pristane/phytane ratios, due to the rise in (ground)water table and the establishment of anaerobic conditions, as well as by decreasing ratios of diasterenes/sterenes, indicating increasing pH values in the mire. The degree of gelification of plant tissue (gelification index) is governed by the microbial activity in the mire, as indicated by the hopanes concentration. The differences in floral assemblage during the formation of the Lavanttal lignite seams are reflected by major differences in tissue preservation. Preservation of plant tissue (TPI) in the Lavanttal lignite is obviously controlled by the presence/absence of decay-resistant gymnosperms in the peat-forming vegetation, and additionally influenced by the relative contribution of wood to coal formation. The results provide evidence that valuable information for coal facies characterization could be obtained by petrography-based and geochemical facies indicators. An influence of the floral assemblage (gymnosperms/angiosperms ratio) and of the contribution of algal biomass on carbon isotopic composition of the organic matter (delta C-13 = -24.2 to -28.6%.) is proposed. Carbon cycling during biogeochemical decomposition of plant tissue by bacteria is suggested to affect the delta C-13 values of the coal, The chemotaxonomical classification of the xylites as gymnosperm remnants, based on the molecular composition of terpenoid biomarkers, is corroborated by the carbon isotopic composition of the xylites (mean delta C-13 = -24.1%) and the extracted cellulose (mean delta C-13 = -20.2%). The higher isotopic difference of about 3.9%. between cellulose and total organic carbon of the xylites, compared to the difference between cellulose and wood found in modem trees, is explained by the smaller effect of decomposition on delta C-13 of cellulose.

AB Rich fens are common boreal ecosystems with distinct hydrology, biogeochemistry and ecology that influence their carbon (C) balance. We present growing season soil chamber methane emission (F-CH4), ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary production (GPP) fluxes from a 9-years water table manipulation experiment in an Alaskan rich fen. The study included major flood and drought years, where wetting and drying treatments further modified the severity of droughts. Results support previous findings from peatlands that drought causes reduced magnitude of growing season F-CH4, GPP and NEE, thus reducing or reversing their C sink function. Experimentally exacerbated droughts further reduced the capacity for the fen to act as a C sink by causing shifts in vegetation and thus reducing magnitude of maximum growing season GPP in subsequent flood years by similar to 15% compared to control plots. Conversely, water table position had only a weak influence on ER, but dominant contribution to ER switched from autotrophic respiration in wet years to heterotrophic in dry years. Droughts did not cause interannual lag effects on ER in this rich fen, as has been observed in several nutrient-poor peatlands. While ER was dependent on soil temperatures at 2 cm depth, F-CH4 was linked to soil temperatures at 25 cm. Inter-annual variability of deep soil temperatures was in turn dependent on wetness rather than air temperature, and higher F-CH4 in flooded years was thus equally due to increased methane production at depth and decreased methane oxidation near the surface. Short-term fluctuations in wetness caused significant lag effects on F-CH4, but droughts caused no inter-annual lag effects on F-CH4. Our results show that frequency and severity of droughts and floods can have characteristic effects on the exchange of greenhouse gases, and emphasize the need to project future hydrological regimes in rich fens.

Employing a method recently introduced to measure ebullition more accurately by taking into account its spatial patchiness in lakes, we estimate point-source ebullition for 16 lakes in Alaska and Siberia that represent several common northern lake types: glacial, alluvial floodplain, peatland and thermokarst (thaw) lakes. Extrapolation of measured fluxes from these 16 sites to all lakes north of 45 degrees N using circumpolar databases of lake and permafrost distributions suggests that northern lakes are a globally, significant source of atmospheric CRI, emitting approximately 24.2 +/- 10.5 Tg CH4 yr(-1). Thermokarst lakes have particularly high emissions because they release CH4 produced from organic matter previously sequestered in permafrost. A carbon mass balance calculation of CH4 release from thermokarst lakes on the Siberian yedoma ice complex suggests that these lakes alone would emit as much as approximately 49 000 Tg CH4 if this ice oo complex was to thaw completely. Using a space-for-time substitution based on the current lake distributions in permafrost- dominated and permafrost-free terrains, we estimate that lake emissions would be reduced by approximately 12% in a more probable transitional permafrost scenario and by approximately 53% in a 'perrnafrost-free' Northern Hemisphere. Lon-term decline in CH4 ebullition from lakes due to lake area loss and permafrost thaw would occur only, after the large release of CRI associated thermokarst lake development in the zone of continuous permafrost.

TI The sequestration of terrestrial organic carbon in Arctic Ocean

AB A variety of approaches have previously been developed to estimate the fraction of terrestrial or marine organic carbon present in aquatic sediments. The task of quantifying each component is especially important for the Arctic due to the regions' sensitivity to global climate change and the potential for enhanced terrestrial organic carbon inputs with continued Arctic warming to alter carbon sequestration. Yet it is unclear how each approach compares in de. ning organic carbon sources in sediments as well as their impact on regional or pan-Arctic carbon budgets. Here, we investigated multiple methods: (1) two end-member mixing models utilizing bulk stable carbon isotopes; (2) the relationship between long-chain n-alkanes and organic carbon (ALKOC); (3) principal components analysis (PCA) combined with scaling of a large suite of lipid biomarkers; and (4) ratios of branched and isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether lipids (the BIT index) to calculate the fraction of terrestrial organic matter components preserved in Arctic marine sediments.
   Estimated terrestrial organic carbon content among approaches showed considerable variation for identical sediment samples. For a majority of the samples, the BIT index resulted in the lowest estimates for terrestrial organic carbon, corroborating recent suggestions that this proxy may represent a distinct fraction of terrestrial organic matter; i.e., peat or soil organic matter, as opposed to markers such as n-alkanes or long-chain fatty acids which measure higher plant wax inputs. Because of the patchy inputs of n-alkanes to this region from coastal erosion in the western Arctic, the ALKOC approach was not as effective as when applied to river-dominated margins found in the eastern Arctic. The difficulties in constraining a marine delta C-13 end-member limit the applicability of stable isotope mixing models in polar regions. Estimates of terrestrial organic carbon using the lipid-based PCA method and the bulk delta C-13 mixing model approach varied drastically at each site, suggesting that organic matter fractions such as amino acids or carbohydrates may affect bulk organic matter composition in a manner that is not captured in the lipid-based analysis. Overall, terrestrial organic matter inputs to the Chukchi and western Beaufort Seas using the average of the methods at each site ranged from 11% to 44%, indicating that land-derived organic matter plays a substantial role in carbon dynamics in the western Arctic Ocean.

AB Soil respiration is the largest C-flux component in the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle, yet in many biomes this flux and its environmental responses are still poorly understood. Several methodological techniques exist to measure this flux, but mostly there remain comparability uncertainties. For example, the closed static chamber (CSC) and the closed dynamic chamber (CDC) systems are widely used, but still require a rigorous comparison. A major issue with the CSC approach is the generally long manual gas sampling periods causing a potential underestimation of the calculated fluxes due to an asymptotic increase in headspace CO2 concentrations. However, shortening the sampling periods of the static chamber approach might provide comparable results to the closed dynamic chamber system. We compared these two different chamber systems using replicated CSC cover boxes and a Li-Cor 8100 CDC system under field conditions, and performed tests on both, mineral and peat soil. Whereas the automated CDC system calculated fluxes during the first two minutes, the CSC approach considered either all seven manual sampling points taken over 75 min, or only the first three sampling points over 15 min. Although flux variation was fairly large, there were considerable and statistically significant differences between the calculated fluxes considering the two chamber systems, yet this depended on soil type and the number of CSC sampling time points. The cover-box approach underestimated the chamber-based fluxes by 30% for combined samples, 21% for mineral and 39% for peat soils when calculated over 75 min but was comparable over the first 15 min. The chamber flux comparison demonstrates that the CSC approach can provide CO2 flux measurements comparable to the CDC system when sampling at an appropriate initial frequency, preventing flux underestimation due to a build up of CO2 headspace concentrations.

AB In this study, six approaches were used to characterize hydrological changes in the Cepkeliai wetland complex (southeast Lithuania), namely (i) local water-table measurements (WTM), (ii) testate amoebae analysis, (iii) tree-ring width (TRW) series, (iv) peat stratigraphic data, (v) (hydro-) meteorological data (precipitation and river runoff), and (vi) a diachronic analysis of aerial photographs as well as historical maps. This multi-proxy framework provides complementary information on the hydrological evolution of the peatland and offers a unique opportunity to discuss the pros and cons of each approach. Local water-table measurements, for example, generated monthly resolved and precise ( +/- 0.01 m) hydrological information, but were limited to a 16-year period. On the other hand, the TRW data generated annually-resolved information linked to hydrological shifts over the period 1848-2018, but did not allow reconstruction of the amplitude of hydrological variations. Amongst the proxy records, the testate amoebae distribution is the only approach that gives a direct measurement of changes in water-table depths. At the same time, the approach is limited by chronological inaccuracies and weaker resolutions, similar to peat stratigraphic records. The meteorological data are theoretically representing the most highly resolved records. However, due to hydrological lags and feedbacks in peatlands, it was difficult to link regional changes observed in meteorological records to local changes in the peatland. The aerial photographs and historical maps offered an opportunity to document large-scale vegetation changes, which is useful for upscaling local results, but they may not capture rapid changes. Despite all these limitations, at Cepkeliai, most of the proxy records are in agreement with each other and suggest relatively moist conditions with water levels close to the peat surface during the late 1800s and early 1900s, followed by more detailed information towards the present showing shifts towards drier peat surface conditions during the 1930s and 1940s. The 1960s were dry, followed by a short, moist episode during the 1970s, and returning to drier conditions during the 1980s. A gradual change towards moister conditions was recorded over the 1990s and 2000s. The last decade in our records started with relatively wet conditions to end with lower water levels over the most recent years.

AB The microbial activity in the soils of the permafrost-affected zones is assumed to be one of the major factors that modify the organic carbon and nitrogen cycle under current climate change. In contrast to the extensive research centered on bacterial abundance, diversity, and metabolic activity in permanently and seasonally frozen mineral soils from high latitudes, frozen peat (organic) environments remain poorly characterized in terms of the physiological diversity and metabolic potential of bacteria. The evolution of soil heterotroph microbial number and metabolic activity across the "seasonally thawed (active)-permanently frozen layer" boundary was studied on 100-cm-thick cores from frozen peat mounds located in the discontinuous permafrost zone in western Siberia. There was a systematic decrease of metabolic activity in the upper 40 cm of the peat core from the surface layers of the mosses and lichens towards the beginning of the frozen horizon, followed by an abrupt increase in bacterial metabolism exactly at the border between the thawed layer and the permafrost table. The aerobic viable cell count and total bacterial number from the active layer were similar to those from the permafrost peat layer. The highest metabolic activity was observed at the beginning of the frozen peat layer and might correspond to the highest availability of amino substrates, which were depleted in the active layer but preserved in the deeper frozen horizons. The enhanced microbial activity at the frozen peat-active layer boundary in western Siberia may persist for another 50-100 years based on the current rate of increase in active layer thickness.

AB Deforestation is a leading cause of biodiversity loss and an important source of global carbon emissions. This means that there are important synergies between climate policy and conservation policy. The highest rates of deforestation occur in tropical countries, where much of the land at the forest frontier is managed informally by smallholders and where governance systems tend to be weak. These features must be considered when designing policies to reduce emissions from deforestation such as REDD+. Deforestation is often accompanied by fires that release large amounts of carbon dioxide. These emissions are especially high in the case of peatlands which contain thick layers of carbon-rich matter. In this paper we derive marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves using data from a farmer survey in Sumatra, where rates of peatland deforestation are high. Comparing these results with farmers' stated willingness to accept payment not to clear forest to establish oil palm suggests that REDD+ policies may be more expensive than MAC estimates suggest The extent to which this is true depends on the types of soils being deforested.

TI High CO2 fluxes from grassland on histic Gleysol along soil carbon and

AB Drained organic soils are anthropogenic emission hotspots of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Most studies have focused on deep peat soils and on peats with high organic carbon content. In contrast, histic Gleysols are characterized by shallow peat layers, which are left over from peat cutting activities or by peat mixed with mineral soil. It is unknown whether they emit less GHGs than deep Histosols when drained. We present the annual carbon and GHG balance of grasslands for six sites on nutrient-poor histic Gleysols with a shallow (30 cm) histic horizon or mixed with mineral soil in Northern Germany (soil organic carbon concentration (C-org)from 9 to 52%).
   The net GHG balance, corrected for carbon export by harvest, was around 4 t CO2-C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) on soils with peat layer and little drainage (mean annual water table < 20 cm below surface). The net GHG balance reached 7- 9 t CO2-C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) on soils with sand mixed into the peat layer and water tables between 14 cm and 39 cm below surface. GHG emissions from drained histic Gleysols (i)wereas high as those from deep Histosols, (ii) increase linearly from shallow to deeper drainage, (iii) but are not affected by C-org content of the histic horizon. Ecosystem respiration (R-eco) was linearly correlated with water table level even if it was below the histic horizon. The R-eco/GPP ratio was 1.5 at all sites, so that we ruled out a major influence of the inter-site variability in vegetation composition on annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE).
   The IPCC definition of organic soils includes shallow histic topsoil, unlike most national and international definitions of Histosols. Our study confirms that this broader definition is appropriate considering anthropogenic GHG emissions from drained organic soils. Countries currently apply soil maps in national GHG inventories which are likely not to include histic Gleysols. The land area with GHG emission hotspots due to drainage is likely to be much higher than anticipated.
   Deeply drained histic Gleysols are GHG hotspots that have so far been neglected or underestimated. Peat mixing with sand does not mitigate GHG emissions. Our study implies that rewetting organic soils, including histic Gleysols, has a much higher relevance for GHG mitigation strategies than currently recognized.

TI Cumulative effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on the
   forest carbon balance in the oil sands region of Alberta, Canada; a
   pilot study (1985-2012)
SO CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Environmental impact assessment; Model; Greenhouse gases; Cumulative
   effects; GCBM
AB Background: Assessing cumulative effects of anthropogenic and natural disturbances on forest carbon (C) stocks and fluxes, because of their relevance to climate change, is a requirement of environmental impact assessments (EIAs) in Canada. However, tools have not been developed specifically for these purposes, and in particular for the boreal forest of Canada, so current forest C assessments in EIAs take relatively simple approaches. Here, we demonstrate how an existing tool, the Generic Carbon Budget Model (GCBM), developed for national and international forest C reporting, was used for an assessment of the cumulative effects of anthropogenic and natural disturbances to support EIA requirements. We applied the GCBM to approximately 1.3 million ha of upland forest in a pilot study area of the oil sands region of Alberta that has experienced a large number of anthropogenic (forestry, energy sector) and natural (wildfire, insect) disturbances.
   Results: Over the 28 years, 25% of the pilot study area was disturbed. Increasing disturbance emissions, combined with declining net primary productivity and reductions in forest area, changed the study area from a net C sink to a net C source. Forest C stocks changed from 332.2 Mt to 327.5 Mt, declining by 4.7 Mt at an average rate of 0.128 tC ha(-1) yr(-1). The largest cumulative areas of disturbance were caused by wildfire (139,000 ha), followed by the energy sector (110,000 ha), insects (33,000 ha) and harvesting (31,000 ha) but the largest cumulative disturbance emissions were caused by the energy sector (9.5 Mt C), followed by wildfire (5.5 Mt C), and then harvesting (1.3 Mt C).
   Conclusion: An existing forest C model was used successfully to provide a rigorous regional cumulative assessment of anthropogenic and natural disturbances on forest C, which meets requirements of EIAs in Canada. The assessment showed the relative importance of disturbances on C emissions in the pilot study area, but their relative importance is expected to change in other parts of the oil sands region because of its diversity in disturbance types, patterns and intensity. Future assessments should include peatland C stocks and fluxes, which could be addressed by using the Canadian Model for Peatlands.

AB As a phenomenon integrating climate conditions and hydrological control of the connection between streams and terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources, groundwater dynamics control patterns of stream DOC characteristics (concentrations and fluxes). Influence of intra-annual variations in groundwater level, discharge and climatic factors on DOC concentrations and fluxes were assessed over 13 years at the headwater watershed of Kervidy-Naizin (5 km(2)) in western France. Four seasonal periods were delineated within each year according to groundwater fluctuations (A: rewetting, B: high flow, C: recession, and D: drought). Annual and seasonal base flow versus stormflow DOC concentrations were defined based on daily hydrograph readings. High interannual variability of annual DOC fluxes (5.4-39.5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) indicates that several years of data are required to encompass variations in water flux to evaluate the actual DOC export capacity of a watershed. Interannual variability of mean annual DOC concentrations was much lower (4.9-7.5 mg CL-1), with concentrations decreasing within each year from ca. 9.2 mg CL-1 in A to ca. 3.0 mg CL-1 in C. This indicates an intra-annual pattern of stream DOC concentrations controlled by DOC source characteristics and groundwater dynamics very similar across years. Partial least squares regressions combined with multiple linear regressions showed that the dry season characteristics (length and draw-down) determine the mean annual DOC concentration while annual runoff determines the annual flux. Antagonistic mechanisms of production-accumulation and dilution-depletion combined with an unlimited DOC supply from riparian wetland soils can mitigate the response of stream concentrations to global changes and climatic variations.

TI Peat accumulation in drained thermokarst lake basins in continuous,

AB Thermokarst lakes and peat-accumulating drained lake basins cover a substantial portion of Arctic lowland landscapes, yet the role of thermokarst lake drainage and ensuing peat formation in landscape-scale carbon (C) budgets remains understudied. Here we use measurements of terrestrial peat thickness, bulk density, organic matter content, and basal radiocarbon age from permafrost cores, soil pits, and exposures in vegetated, drained lake basins to characterize regional lake drainage chronology, C accumulation rates, and the role of thermokarst-lake cycling in carbon dynamics throughout the Holocene on the northern Seward Peninsula, Alaska. Most detectable lake drainage events occurred within the last 4,000 years with the highest drainage frequency during the medieval climate anomaly. Peat accumulation rates were highest in young (50-500 years) drained lake basins (35.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and decreased exponentially with time since drainage to 9 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the oldest basins. Spatial analyses of terrestrial peat depth, basal peat radiocarbon ages, basin geomorphology, and satellite-derived land surface properties (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF)) from Landsat satellite data revealed significant relationships between peat thickness and mean basin NDVI or MNF. By upscaling observed relationships, we infer that drained thermokarst lake basins, covering 391 km(2) (76%) of the 515 km(2) study region, store 6.4-6.6 Tg organic C in drained lake basin terrestrial peat. Peat accumulation in drained lake basins likely serves to offset greenhouse gas release from thermokarst-impacted landscapes and should be incorporated in landscape-scale C budgets.

AB Although methane (CH4) dynamics are known to differ at broad scales among peatland types and with climate, there is limited understanding of the variability associated with anaerobic carbon (C) cycling, and, the mechanisms that control that variability, among low pH, Sphagnum moss-dominated peatlands within a geographical region with similar climate. This is important because upscaling of CH4 emissions to regional and global scales often considers peatlands as a single, or at most two, ecosystem type(s). Here, we report the results from two studies exploring the controls of CH4 cycling in peatlands from the Upper Midwest (USA). Potential CH4 production and resultant CO2:CH4 ratios varied by several orders-of-magnitude among these soils. These differences were only partially explained by pH and fiber content (a measure of degree of decomposition in peat), suggesting other, more complicated controls may drive CH4 cycling in ombrotrophic peat soils. Based in part on the results from this survey, we more intensively examined CH4 dynamics in three bog-like, acidic, Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in northern Minnesota that differed in their degree of ombrotrophy. Net CH4 flux was lowest in the peatland with well-developed hummocks, and the isotopic composition of the CH4 along with methanotroph gene expression indicated a strong role for CH4 oxidation in controlling net CH4 flux. There were limited differences in porewater chemistry (CH4 and dissolved inorganic C concentrations) or microbial community composition among sites, and potential CH4 production was also similar among the sites. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that high variation in CH4 cycling in seemingly similar peatlands within a single geographical region is common. We suggest a one peatland represents all approach is inappropriate-even among Sphagnum-dominated peatlands-and caution must be used when extrapolating data from a single site to the landscape scale, even for outwardly very similar peatlands. Instead, the macroscale development of peatlands, and concomitantly their microtopography as expressed in the proportion of hummocks, hollows, lawns and pools, need to be considered as central controls over CH4 emissions.

AB Agricultural peatlands are essential for a myriad of ecosystem functions and play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle through C sequestration. Management of these agricultural peatlands takes place at different spatial scales, ranging from local to landscape management, and drivers of soil microbial community structure and function may be scale-dependent. Effective management for an optimal biogeochemical functioning thus requires knowledge of the drivers on soil microbial community structure and functioning, as well as the spatial scales upon which they are influenced. During two field campaigns, we examined the importance of different drivers (i.e., soil characteristics, nutrient management, vegetation composition) at two spatial scales (local vs. landscape) for, respectively, the soil microbial community structure (determined by PLFA) and soil microbial community functional capacity (as assessed by CLPP) in agricultural peatlands. First, we show by an analysis of PLFA profiles that the total microbial biomass changes with soil moisture and relative C:P nutrient availability. Secondly, we showed that soil communities are controlled by a distinct set of drivers at the local, as opposed to landscape, scale. Community structure was found to be markedly different between areas, in contrast to community function which showed high variability within areas. We further found that microbial structure appears to be controlled more at a landscape scale by nutrient-related variables, whereas microbial functional capacity is driven locally through plant community feedbacks. Optimal management strategies within such peatlands should therefore consider the scale-dependent action of soil microbial community drivers, for example by first optimizing microbial structure at the landscape scale by targeted areal management, and then optimizing soil microbial function by local vegetation management.

AB It is commonly assumed that agricultural peatlands are net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere because of lowered water tables and intensive land management altering the balance of plant productivity and respiration. Yet actual farm-scale fluxes of CO2 have been infrequently quantified. We measured net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) using a permanent and a mobile eddy covariance tower installed over dairy farms with year-round rotational grazing on deep peats in New Zealand. The permanent tower was in place for one year and the mobile tower was deployed for periods of 3-4 weeks at three other farms on peat between spring and autumn. At all sites, grazing cycles caused large variations in pasture biomass and consequent daytime NEE and we accounted for these variations using an index of photosynthesising biomass (phytomass index, Lohila et al., 2004) automatically derived from daily CO2 flux measurements. We estimated annual CO2 loss of 190 gC m(-2)yr(-1) for the permanent site, which is in broad agreement with other agricultural peatland studies. Including other farm-scale exports of C, overall net ecosystem carbon loss estimated for the permanent site was 294 gC m(-2) yr(-1). Accounting for changes in phytomass index, daytime NEE was similar for permanent-mobile site farm pairings, except when there were very large differences in water table depths between farms in autumn. In contrast, night-time respiration losses were almost identical between farms even when water tables were markedly different, suggesting that spatial differences in NEE in these agricultural peatlands are caused by reduced photosynthesis in dry periods, due to plant water stress, rather than increased respiration. Comparisons between permanent and mobile towers appeared a useful approach for determining spatial variability of CO2 fluxes from peat soils. Taken together, our results suggested that the CO2 losses measured at the permanent site were representative of CO2 losses for farmed peats in the Waikato region when the water table was within similar to 0.5 m of the surface. Where water tables were deeper net CO2 losses would be expected to be greater due to reduced pasture photosynthesis and production. Maintaining higher water tables might achieve dual benefits of increasing pasture productivity and reducing CO2 losses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To quantify the contribution of autotrophic microorganisms to organic matter (OM) formation in soils, we investigated natural CO2 vents (mofettes) situated in a wetland in northwest Bohemia (Czech Republic). Mofette soils had higher soil organic matter (SOM) concentrations than reference soils due to restricted decomposition under high CO2 levels. We used radiocarbon (Delta C-14) and stable carbon (delta C-13) isotope ratios to characterize SOM and its sources in two mofettes and compared it with respective reference soils, which were not influenced by geogenic CO2.
   The geogenic CO2 emitted at these sites is free of radiocarbon and enriched in C-13 compared to atmospheric CO2. Together, these isotopic signals allow us to distinguish C fixed by plants from C fixed by autotrophic microorganisms using their differences in C-13 discrimination. We can then estimate that up to 27% of soil organic matter in the 0-10 cm layer of these soils was derived from microbially assimilated CO2.
   Isotope values of bulk SOM were shifted towards more positive delta C-13 and more negative Delta C-14 values in mofettes compared to reference soils, suggesting that geogenic CO2 emitted from the soil atmosphere is incorporated into SOM. To distinguish whether geogenic CO2 was fixed by plants or by CO2 assimilating microorganisms, we first used the proportional differences in radiocarbon and delta C-13 values to indicate the magnitude of discrimination of the stable isotopes in living plants. Deviation from this relationship was taken to indicate the presence of microbial CO2 fixation, as microbial discrimination should differ from that of plants. (CO2)-C-13-labelling experiments confirmed high activity of CO2 assimilating microbes in the top 10 cm, where delta C-13 values of SOM were shifted up to 2% towards more negative values. Uptake rates of microbial CO2 fixation ranged up to 1.59 +/- 0.16 mu g g(dw)(-1) d(-1). We inferred that the negative delta C-13 shift was caused by the activity of autotrophic microorganisms using the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle, as indicated from quantification of cbbL/cbbM marker genes encoding for RubisCO by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and by acetogenic and methanogenic microorganisms, shown present in the mofettes by previous studies. Combined Delta C-14 and delta C-13 isotope mass balances indicated that microbially derived carbon accounted for 8-27% of bulk SOM in this soil layer.
   The findings imply that autotrophic microorganisms can recycle significant amounts of carbon in wetland soils and might contribute to observed radiocarbon reservoir effects influencing Delta C-14 signatures in peat deposits.

AB Symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi enhance plant nutrient uptake and-growth, especially in nutrient-poor conditions. The changes in plant metabolism due to mycorrhizal. colonization could lead to alterations in plant suitability for herbivory. I investigated the effects of these fungal symbionts on oak, Quercus, growth and insect herbivory, and assessed the extent to which herbivore performance was affected by mycorrhizal colonization due to shifts in plant carbon allocation. Northern red oak, Quercus rubra L., acorns were inoculated with the ectomycorrhizal fungus, Pisolithus tinctorius (Persoon), and planted in either a nutrient-rich peat:perlite mixture or a nutrient-poor mine spoil:sand mixture. Plants were grown under greenhouse conditions for 45 d, after which seedling productivity was measured and herbivore performance trials were conducted. Gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), caterpillars were allowed to feed for the duration of the third instar, and performance was measured. Nonmycorrhizal, nutrient-poor plants had the-lowest height growth, and produced the fewest leaves with the lowest leaf area and leaf mass, when compared with plants in the other treatments. Seedlings colonized by fungal symbionts showed enhanced productivity relative to noncolonized seedlings in several respects, including the number of leaves produced, leaf area, and basal stem diameter. Acorns grown in nutrient-rich substrate had a greater number of leaves, leaf area, leaf mass, and leaf area ratio, when compared with acorns grown in nutrient poor substrate, regardless of colonization status. Caterpillar growth and consumption rates were lowest on nutrient-rich, mycorrhizal plants, suggesting that colonized plants decrease herbivore performance in nutrient-rich conditions, when mycorrhizae axe functioning parasitically. The data do not support the hypothesis that herbivore performance would increase on nutrient-poor, mycorrhizal plants, when mycorrhizal colonization provides the greatest benefits to the host plant.

AB Quantifying rates of microbial carbon transformation in peatlands is essential for gaining mechanistic understanding of the factors that influence methane emissions from these systems, and for predicting how emissions will respond to climate change and other disturbances. In this study, we used porewater stable isotopes collected from both the edge and center of a thermokarst bog in Interior Alaska to estimate in situ microbial reaction rates. We expected that near the edge of the thaw feature, actively thawing permafrost and greater abundance of sedges would increase carbon, oxygen and nutrient availability, enabling faster microbial rates relative to the center of the thaw feature. We developed three different conceptual reaction networks that explained the temporal change in porewater CO2, CH4, delta C-13-CO2 and delta C-13-CH4. All three reaction-network models included methane production, methane oxidation and CO2 production, and two of the models included homoacetogenesis-a reaction not previously included in isotope-based porewater models. All three models fit the data equally well, but rates resulting from the models differed. Most notably, inclusion of homoacetogenesis altered the modeled pathways of methane production when the reaction was directly coupled to methanogenesis, and it decreased gross methane production rates by up to a factor of five when it remained decoupled from methanogenesis. The ability of all three conceptual reaction networks to successfully match the measured data indicate that this technique for estimating in situ reaction rates requires other data and information from the site to confirm the considered set of microbial reactions. Despite these differences, all models indicated that, as expected, rates were greater at the edge than in the center of the thaw bog, that rates at the edge increased more during the growing season than did rates in the center, and that the ratio of acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was greater at the edge than in the center. In both locations, modeled rates (excluding methane oxidation) increased with depth. A puzzling outcome from the effort was that none of the models could fit the porewater dataset without generating "fugitive" carbon (i.e., methane or acetate generated by the models but not detected at the field site), indicating that either our conceptualization of the reactions occurring at the site remains incomplete or our site measurements are missing important carbon transformations and/or carbon fluxes. This model-data discrepancy will motivate and inform future research efforts focused on improving our understanding of carbon cycling in permafrost wetlands.

AB A Fe-N-C catalyst, synthesized with porous carbon BP2000, the nitrogen source imidazole and iron source FeCl3, is developed for SO2 electrooxidation through a series of thermal and pyrolytic disposing processes. The electrochemical measurements of linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) and cyclic voltammograms (CV) are applied to investigate the SO2 oxidation performance of the catalyst. The results show that the half-wave oxidation potential of Fe-N-C is 283.8 mV lower than that of BP2000 meanwhile the onset oxidation potential reduces 58 mV as well, implying there is a highly improved SO2 oxidation performance of the catalyst. The structural and physical characteristics of the Fe-N-C catalyst are examined by the methods of TEM, XPS, XRD and Raman spectroscopy. The characterization proves the formation of graphitic carbon, iron carbides, single-layer graphene and defects as well as the existence of FeN/Fe2N, pyridinic N and Fe-N components on the prepared Fe-N-C catalyst, which are supposed to have significant effects on the SO2 electrooxidation performance.

AB A novel genus and species, Methylocapsa acidiphila gen. nov., sp. nov., are proposed for a methane-oxidizing bacterium isolated from an acidic Sphagnum peat bog. This bacterium, designated strain B2(T),represents aerobic, Gram-negative, colourless, non-motile, curved coccoids that form conglomerates covered by an extracellular polysaccharide matrix. The cells use methane and methanol as sole sources of carbon and energy and utilize the serine pathway for carbon assimilation. Strain B2(T) is a moderately acidophilic organism with growth between pH 4.2 and 7.2 and at temperatures from 10 to 30 degreesC. The cells possess a well-developed system of intracytoplasmic membranes (ICM) packed in parallel on only one side of the cell membrane. This type of ICM structure represents a novel arrangement, which was termed type III. The resting cells are Azotobacter-type cysts. Strain B2(T) is capable of atmospheric nitrogen fixation; it possesses particulate methane monooxygenase and does not express soluble methane monooxygenase. The major phospholipid fatty acid is 18:1omega7c and the major phospholipids are phosphatidylglycerols. The G+C content of the DNA is 63.1 mol%. This bacterium belongs to the alpha-subclass of the Proteobacteria and is most closely related to the acidophilic methanotroph Methylocella palustris K-T (97.3 % 16S rDNA sequence similarity). However, the DNA-DNA hybridization value between strain B2(T) and Methylocella palustris K-T is only 7 %. Thus, strain B2(T) is proposed to comprise a novel genus and species, Methylocapsa acidiphila gen. nov., sp. nov. Strain B2(T) (= DSM 13967(T) = NCIMB 13765(T)) is the type strain.

AB There is a widely recognized link between iron bioavailability and phytoplankton growth in large tracts of the World Ocean. Iron bioavailability is thus pivotal to the removal of atmospheric carbon via the ocean's 'biological pump.' To evaluate future scenarios of global climate change, we must therefore understand better how the bioavailability of iron in seawater is linked to processes controlling its supply, chemical speciation and removal from the water column. Much of the research on iron inputs to the open ocean has focused on atmospheric, benthic (shelf sediments) and hydrothermal (midocean) sources of iron. The conventional wisdom has been that riverine iron sources are negligible because many of the major world rivers exhibit extensive removal of dissolved iron by flocculation processes during estuarine mixing. However, recent studies have revealed that a fraction of iron associated with peatland-derived humic and fulvic acids may survive aggregation processes in the freshwater-seawater mixing zone, and thus be exported offshore. This review is a synthesis of available data and information for and against the hypothesis that land-derived humic substances exert a significant control on the marine biogeochemical cycle of iron. From the outset, it is shown that this hypothesis can neither be verified nor disproved at present, in part due to analytical difficulties in characterizing the all-important marine colloidal phase. Evidence is then presented on the likely chemical nature and structure of iron-binding humic ligands along with implications for the lateral transport of iron in surface waters and its participation in carbon stabilization in marine sediments. This is followed by a discussion of photochemically and microbially mediated processes acting on terrestrial humic substances and a discussion of how terrestrial humic substances may influence the biological availability of iron. The review finishes with a presentation of measurement technologies and approaches that could be used to assess (i) how iron-binding ligands in seawater relate to land-derived humic substances and (ii) how terrestrial humics may influence the global carbon cycle indirectly by influencing the processes that control the supply and maintain the pool of 'dissolved' iron in the ocean.

AB Determining the magnitude of carbon (C) storage in forests and peatlands is an important step towards predicting how regional carbon balance will respond to climate change. However, spatial heterogeneity of dominant forest and peatland cover types can inhibit accurate C storage estimates. We evaluated ecosystem C pools and productivity in the Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF), in northern Minnesota, USA, using a network of plots that were evenly spaced across a heterogeneous 1-km(2) mosaic composed of a mix of upland forests and peatlands. Using a nested plot design, we estimated the standing C stock of vegetation, coarse detrital wood and soil pools. We also estimated aboveground net primary production (ANPP) as well as coarse root production. Additionally we evaluated how vegetation cover types within the study area differed in C storage. The total ecosystem C pool did not vary significantly among upland areas dominated by aspen (160 +/- 13 Mg C ha(-1)), mixed hardwoods (153 +/- 19 Mg C ha(-1)), and conifers (197 +/- 23 Mg C ha(-1)). Live vegetation accounted for approximately 50% of the total ecosystem C pool in these upland areas, and soil (including forest floor) accounted for another 35-40%, with remaining C stored as detrital wood. Compared to upland areas, total C stored in peatlands was much greater, 1286 +/- 125 Mg C ha(-1), with 90-99% of that C found in peat soils that ranged from 1 to 5 m in depth. Forested areas ranged from 2.6 to 2.9 Mg C ha(-1) in ANPP, which was highest in conifer-dominated upland areas. In alder-dominated and black spruce-dominated peatland areas, ANPP averaged 2.8 Mg C ha(-1), and in open peatlands, ANPP averaged 1.5 Mg C ha(-1). In treed areas of forest and peatlands, our estimates of coarse root production ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 Mg C ha(-1). Despite the lower production in open peatlands, all peatlands have acted as long-term C sinks over hundreds to thousands of years and store significantly more C per unit area than is stored in uplands. Despite occupying only 13% of our study area, peatlands store almost 50% of the C contained within it. Because C storage in peatlands depends largely on climatic drivers, the impact of climate changes on peatlands may have important ramifications for C budgets of the western Great Lakes region.

AB The knowledge on spatial distribution and status of organic soils are essential for climate reporting and carbon stock calculations. In Germany so far, the official soil map at a scale of 1:1,000,000 is used. With respect to e.g. land use dependent calculations of greenhouse gas emissions, a significantly higher level of detail is required. The aim of this study was to establish a homogenous and nationwide dataset on the distribution of organic soils and their relevant soil properties for Germany at a sufficient spatial resolution.
   For the first time, a detailed and almost complete dataset on organic soils for Germany could be derived based on map legacy data, soil borehole databases and detailed data on topography, hydrology and geology accompanied by additional ground verification.
   Based on the new dataset, organic soils are estimated to cover 15,682 km(2) of Germany (4.4% of the total area) and account for an organic carbon pool up to a depth of 2 m of nearly 13 Gt. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. The effects of increased nitrogen or phosphorus supply on the productivity of Sphagnum-dominated ombrotrophic bogs in northern and southern Sweden were studied. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition in southern Sweden (high-N site) exceeds that in northern Sweden (low-N site) by about tenfold.
   2. Vertical height growth of the Sphagnum carpet was measured by the cranked-wire method. Length growth of individuals was measured by autoradiography after labelling with (CO2)-C-14. The results of both methods were significantly correlated, but the cranked-wire data were systematically lower.
   3. Productivity of Sphagnum at the low-N site increased almost fourfold after additional nitrogen supply (4 g N m-2 year-1), but no increase was found after additional phosphorus supply (0.4 g P m-2 year-1). At the high-N site, phosphorus supply caused an almost threefold productivity increase, but nitrogen supply did not result in any productivity increase. Thus, in an area with a high atmospheric nitrogen supply, plant productivity is P-limited instead of N-limited.
   4. At an intermediate nitrogen supply (2 g N m-2 year-1) the recovery of the supplied nitrogen in the Sphagnum carpet was not different for both sites (60% and 69%, respectively). However, at a high nitrogen supply (4 g N m-2 year-1) nitrogen recovery at the low-N site significantly exceeded that at the high-N site (73% and 47%, respectively). At the low-N site, the supplied phosphorus was not recovered, but at the high-N site the phosphorus recovery was 85% (intermediate phosphorus supply) and 100% (high phosphorus supply), respectively.
   5. It is suggested that a high atmospheric nitrogen supply may affect the carbon balance of ombrotrophic bogs, because productivity is under these circumstances not N-limited, but decomposition is probably increased by high loads of nitrogen. In the end, this may turn these C-accumulating systems into C-emitting systems.

AB Fungal root endophytes are plant associates that colonize root tissue internally without causing any obvious harm to their host. Although ubiquitous, this relationship is not well understood. Our objectives were to determine the effects of fungal root endophyte inoculation on plant biomass and nitrogen concentration by conducting an extensive meta-analysis. We also explored the effects of experimental conditions on the host-endophyte relationship. We performed analyses weighted with non-parametric variance on plant response to root endophytes from the Ascomycetes (excluding the Clavacipitaceae), including categorical analyses of 21 experimental factors, ranging from the identity of the host and the endophyte, to the composition of the growing medium. The response of total biomass to endophyte inoculation was 18 % lower than non-inoculated controls, while individually, root biomass, shoot biomass, and nitrogen concentration responses to endophyte inoculation were neutral. The identities of both the host and the endophyte had an influence, as did the original source of the endophyte (whether or not the isolate used originated from the same host species). Experimental conditions also influenced the plant-endophyte relationship, with the most important being the availability and sources of carbon and organic nitrogen, particularly peat moss. Although our analysis demonstrates that overall plant biomass and nitrogen concentration responses to ascomycetous root endophyte inoculation is neutral to negative, these results are somewhat confounded by among-study differences in experimental conditions, which undoubtedly contribute to the high levels of variability in plant response seen in the literature.

TI THE EFFECT OF STOLON BURIAL AND DEFOLIATION EARLY IN THE GROWING-SEASON
   ON WHITE CLOVER PERFORMANCE

ID GRAZED SWARDS
AB A factorial pot-experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of burial of stolons (stolons unburied or buried to a depth of 0.5-1 cm at day 0), with and without defoliation (plants uncut or all unfolded laminae removed at weekly intervals) on the growth of two varieties of white clover (cv. Kent or cv. Milkanova) harvested on three dates (14 d, 28 d and 42 d after burial).  The soil used was a 3:2:1 mixture of clay loam:peat:sand, and there were three replicates of each variety for each treatment at each harvest date.
   Burial of stolons in the absence of defoliation had no effect on stolon extension, leaf appearance, or the concentration of water-soluble carbohydrate in the stolons.  The number of axillary buds developing (new branches plus flowers) was increased on the new surface-growing tips of primary stolons but was reduced on branch (i.e. secondary) stolons.  The proportion of branches to flowers was largely unaffected by burial.
   Defoliation caused substantial reductions in the concentration of water-soluble carbohydrates in stolons and stolon extension growth, a reduction in number of axillary buds developing, and in the proportion of buds which were floral, but had only a small effect in reducing leaf appearance.
   The combination of stolon burial and defoliation resulted in the death of secondary stolons; 42% of all secondary stolons had died by day 42, and stolon extension, leaf appearance and numbers of axillary buds developing on secondary stolons were severely reduced.  The numbers of axillary buds developing on primary stolons was increased owing to more buds developing on the resurfaced stolon tips, but the increase was inadequate to compensate for the reduced growth, and death of secondary stolons.
   Differences between clover varieties in response to treatments were small.  In general, the smaller variety, cv. Kent, was more adversely affected by burial than the larger variety, cv. Milkanova.  A variety X defoliation interaction occurred for senescence of leaves; petiole senescence of cut leaves was reduced or similar to that of intact leaves for cv. Kent, but was increased for cv. Milkanova.
   The results are discussed in relation to treatment effects on carbon sources and sinks, and in relation to climate-soil interactions.

AB Biochar is a source of carbon with physico-chemical and biological properties that allow it to promote microbial growth, to absorb moisture and to improve the adsorption and/or degradation of pesticides. We evaluated the effect of biochar as a partial replacement of commercial peat in the pesticide-degrading biomixtures of a biopurification system known as biobed. Each biomixture was prepared with one type of soil (clay, trumao and sandy), straw, peat and biochar in different volumetric proportions. In each biomixture, the residual pesticide (atrazine, carbendazim, chlorpyrifos, isoproturon, iprodione and diazinon) concentration, the pH, and the levels of organic carbon (OC) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) were measured at the beginning (day 0) and at the end (day 40) of the pesticide degradation assay. The obtained results demonstrated that at day 0, the pH of the biomixtures, regardless of soil type, increased incrementally with increasing amounts of biochar, whereas the OC and TKN values remain constant. At the end of the pesticide degradation assay, changes were observed in the biomixtures that demonstrated differences among their pesticide degradation abilities. In general, pesticide degradation was higher in the control biomixtures (without biochar) than in biomixtures prepared with biochar. An exception was the pesticide iprodione, which presented a highest degradation efficicency when biochar was included in the biomixture. Although the use of biochar as a replacement of peat in the biomixtures did not significantly improve pesticide degradation, a decrease in the initial residual concentration of the pesticides was observed. Therefore, biochar may represent an interesting material to replace peat in biomixtures designed to degrade and/or adsorb pesticides.

AB Coalsack Bluff was the first discovery site in Antarctica for the latest Permian to earliest Triassic reptile Lystrosaurus. This together with discovery of Permian Glossopteris leaves during the heroic age of Antarctic exploration, indicated not only that Antarctica was part of Gondwanaland, but also that Antarctic rocks recorded faunas from the greatest of all mass extinctions at the Permian-Triassic boundary. Pinpointing the exact stratigraphic level of this life crisis has recently become possible using delta C-13 values in terrestrial organic matter. Multiple, short-lived events of C-13 depletion may reflect carbon cycle crises, with the isotopic change a measure of terrestrial and atmospheric disequilibrium. Additional evidence for ecosystem reorganization came from changes in paleosol types and their root traces. Such studies previously completed at the Antarctic localities of Graphite Peak, Mount Crean, Portal Mountain, Shapeless Mountain and Allan Hills, are here extended to Coalsack Bluff. Carbon isotopic values in Permian rocks at Coalsack Bluff average -23.08 +/- 0.25 parts per thousand, but begin to decline within the last coal with leaves (Glossopteris), roots (Vertebraria) and permineralized stumps (Araucarioxylon) of glossopterids. The low point in a C-13 values is -27.19 parts per thousand at 5.6 m above the last coal, which is capped by unusually abundant pyrite, and a claystone breccia with common clasts of redeposited clayey soils. Above this are massive quartz-rich sandstones of braided streams, considered a geomorphic response to deforestation and soil erosion following the mass extinction. Distinctive berthierine-bearing paleosols (Dolores pedotype) within these sandstones have unoxidized iron taken as evidence of severe groundwater hypoxia. Other paleosols at this stratigraphic level are like those in other Early Triassic rocks of Antarctica, which indicate unusually warm and humid conditions for such high paleolatitude lowlands. Waterlogging is also indicated by newly discovered kinds of paleosol (Ernest pedotype) with groundwater calcretes. The lack of peat accumulation in such waterlogged lowlands, berthierine in paleosols and large negative carbon isotopic shift at Coalsack Bluff support the idea of atmospheric pollution with methane from submarine and permafrost clathrates as a cause for the Permian-Triassic mass extinction. Hypoxic soils would have killed lowland plants by preventing root respiration and hypoxic air would have challenged vertebrates with pulmonary edema. Causes for catastrophic methane release remain unclear. Flood basalt eruptions, dolerite intrusions into coal measures,. submarine landslides, tectonic faulting, and bolide impact suggested for episodes of methane release at other times are also plausible for the Permian-Triassic boundary.

AB Peatlands within the boreal-temperate ecotone contain the majority of terrestrial carbon in this region, and there is concern over the fate of such carbon stores in the face of global environmental changes. The Spruce and Peatland Response Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) facility aims to advance the understanding of how such peatlands may respond to such changes, using a combination of whole ecosystem warming (WEW; +0, 2.25, 4.5, 6.75, and 9 degrees C) and elevated CO2 (eCO(2); +500 ppm) treatments in an intact bog ecosystem. We examined photosynthetic and respiration responses in leaves of two ericaceous shrub species-leatherleaf [Chamaedaphne calyculata (L.) Moench] and bog Labrador tea [Rhododendron groenlandicum (Oeder) Kron & Judd]-to the first year of combined eCO(2) and WEW treatments at SPRUCE. We surveyed the leaf N content per area (N-area), net photosynthesis (A(ST)) and respiration (R-D25) at 25 degrees C and 400 ppm CO2 and net photosynthesis at mean growing conditions (A(GR)) of newly emerged, mature and overwintered leaves. We also measured leaf non-structural carbohydrate content (NSC) in mature leaves. The effects of WEW and eCO(2) varied by season and species, highlighting the need to accommodate such variability in modeling this system. In mature leaves, we did not observe a response to either treatment of AST or R-D25 in R. groenlandicum, but we did observe a 50% decrease in A(ST) of C. calyculata with eCO(2). In mature leaves under eCO(2), neither species had increased A(GR) and both had increases in NSC, indicating acclimation of photosynthesis to eCO(2) may be related to source-sink imbalances of carbohydrates. Thus, productivity gains of shrubs under eCO(2) may be lower than previously predicted for this site by models not accounting for such acclimation. In newly emerged leaves, A(ST) increased with WEW in R. groenlandicum, but not C. calyculata. Overwintered leaves exhibited a decrease in R-D25 for R. groenlandicum and in A(ST) for C. calyculata with increasing WEW, as well as an increase of A(GR) with eCO(2) in both species. Responses in newly emerged and overwintered leaves may reflect physiological acclimation or phenological changes in response to treatments.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in groundwater is fundamentally important with respect to biogeo-chemical reactions, global carbon cycling, heavy metal transport, water treatability and potability. One source of DOM to groundwater is from the transport of organic matter from the vadose zone by rainfall recharge. Changes in precipitation patterns associated with natural climate variability and climate change are expected to alter the load and character of organic matter released from these areas, which ultimately impacts on groundwater quality and DOM treatability. In order to investigate potential changes in groundwater DOM character after rainfall recharge, we sampled shallow groundwater from a coastal peat-rich sand aquifer in New South Wales, Australia, during an extended period of low precipitation (average daily precipitation rate < 1.6 mm day(-1) over the 8 months prior to sampling), and after two heavy precipitation events (84 mm day(-1) and 98 mm day(-1) respectively). We assess changes in DOM composition after correcting for dilution by a novel combination of two advanced analytical techniques: liquid chromatography organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) and negative-ion electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). We also assess changes in water chemistry pre- and post-rainfall. Post-rainfall, we show that the dilution-corrected amount of highly aromatic DOM molecular formulae (i.e. those categorised into the groups polyphenolics and condensed aromatics) were 1.7 and 2.0 times higher respectively than in pre-rainfall samples. We attribute this to the flushing of peat-derived DOM from buried organic material into the groundwater. We also identify that periods of low precipitation can lead to low hydrophilic/HOC ratios in groundwater (median = 4.9, n = 14). Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to compare the HOC fraction with FT-ICR MS compound groups. We show that HOC has a more aromatic character in pre-rainfall samples, and is less similar to the aromatic groups in post-rainfall samples. This suggests that the decline in water-borne hydrophobics observed post-rainfall could be associated with preferential adsorption of the hydrophobic aromatic DOM, making post-rainfall samples less treatable for potable water supply. Post-rainfall we also observe significant increases in arsenic (leading to concentrations greater than 3 times the World Health Organisation drinking water limit of 10 mu g/ L). Increases in coastal rainfall due to climate change may therefore alter the composition of groundwater DOM in coastal peatland areas in ways that may impact DOM bioavailability, and increase arsenic concentrations, reducing the ease of water treatment for human consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify the chemical and molecular changes of shallow groundwater DOM pre-rainfall and post-rainfall in a sedimentary organic carbon rich environment through multiple analytical techniques.

AB British vegetation is estimated to contain 113.8 million tC, 80 per cent of which is in forests and woodlands (91.9 million tC). Sitka spruce plantations, although covering 21.4 per cent of the forest/woodland area, contain only 8.2 per cent of the forest/woodland carbon, because the plantations are young and have an average of only 14.1 tC ha(-1). Broadleaved woodlands in Britain have an average of 61.9 tC ha(-1) and contain 46.8 per cent of the total carbon in all vegetation. A breakdown is given of the carbon density (tC ha(-1)) and content of different tree species. A carbon density map of Britain highlights the concentration of carbon in the broadleaved woodlands in southern England and in the large conifer plantations in southern Scotland and northern England.
   Carbon storage in the trees, products, litter and soil can be evaluated in terms of long-term equilibrium storage or short-term rate of storage. These two components vary among forest types in Britain and globally. Plantations harvested at the time of maximum mean annual increment (MAI) will not store as much carbon as mature, old-growth forests on the same site unless they have long-lasting products and/or are very fast growing. Maximum equilibrium carbon storage is generally achieved by harvesting at the time of maximum MAI when the lifetime of products exceeds the time to maximum MAI. Undisturbed peatlands sequester CO2 and emit CH4, and may be greenhouse neutral. When peatlands are drained and planted with trees, they stop emitting CH4 and store carbon in the trees, forest litter, forest soil and wood products. However, these greenhouse gas 'gains' are offset by the oxidation to CO2 of the pear, and the gains are exceeded by CO2 losses when 20-40 cm depth of peat has been oxidized. Forests in Britain are currently sequestering 1.5-1.7 million tC a(-1) in trees, 0.3-0.5 tC a(-1) in litter and 0.5 million tC a(-1) in wood products, totalling about 2.5 million tC, equivalent to about 1.5 per cent of the carbon currently emitted by burning fossil fuels in the UK. In order to maintain the current forest carbon sink, the forest area needs to continue to expand at about 25000 ha a(-1) of upland conifers or 10000 ha a(-1) of poplars on good land.

AB Soil erosion has been discussed intensively but controversial both as a significant source or a significant sink of atmospheric carbon possibly explaining the gap in the global carbon budget. One of the major points of discussion has been whether or not carbon is degraded and mineralized to CO2 during detachment, transport and deposition of soil material. By combining the caesium-137 (Cs-137) approach (quantification of erosion rates) with stable carbon isotope signatures (process indicator of mixing versus degradation of carbon pools) we were able to show that degradation of carbon occurs during soil erosion processes at the investigated mountain grasslands in the central Swiss Alps (Urseren Valley, Canton Uri). Transects from upland (erosion source) to wetland soils (erosion sinks) of sites affected by sheet and land slide erosion were sampled. Analysis of Cs-137 yielded an input of 2 and 4.6 tha(-1) yr(-1) of soil material into the wet-lands sites. Assuming no degradation of soil organic carbon during detachment and transport, carbon isotope signature of soil organic carbon in the wetlands could only be explained with an assumed 500-600 and 350-400 years of erosion input into the wetlands Laui and Spissen, respectively. The latter is highly unlikely with alpine peat growth rates indicating that the upper horizons might have an age between 7 and 200 years. While we do not conclude from our data that eroded soil organic carbon is generally degraded during detachment and transport, we propose this method to gain more information on process dynamics during soil erosion from oxic upland to anoxic wetland soils, sediments or water bodies.

AB Year-round flooding provides a common land management practice to reestablish the natural carbon dioxide (CO2) sink function of drained peatlands. Here we present eddy covariance measurements of net CO2 exchange from a temperate fen during three consecutive growing seasons (May-October) that span a period of conversion from moderately rewetting to flooding. When we started our measurements in 2009, the hydrological conditions were representative for the preceding 20years with a mean growing season water level (MWGL) of 0cm but considerably lower water levels in summer. Flooding began in 2010 with an MWGL of 36cm above the surface. The fen was a net CO2 sink throughout all growing seasons (2009: -333.312.3, 2010: -294.18.4, 2011: -352.45.1g C m(-2)), but magnitudes of canopy photosynthesis (CP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) differed distinctively. Rates of CP and Reco were high before flooding, dropped by 46% and 61%, respectively, in 2010, but increased again during the beginning of growing season 2011 until the water level started to rise further due to strong rainfalls during June and July. We assume that flooding decreases not only the CO2 release due to inhibited Reco under anaerobic conditions but also CO2 sequestration rates are constricted due to decreased CP. We conclude that rewetting might act as a disturbance for a plant community that has adapted to drier conditions after decades of drainage. However, if the recent species are still abundant, a rise in CP and autotrophic Reco can be expected after plants have developed plastic response strategies to wetter conditions.

AB Detailed study of a peat plateau near the southern boundary of the East European permafrost zone has been performed. The botanical and palynological compositions of the peat to the depth of 10 m, its radiocarbon dates (the AMS method), and its physical and chemical characteristics have been determined. The accumulation of peat in this area began about 8300 years ago at the end of the Boreal period. In the middle of the Atlantic period, the rate of peat accumulation reached 1.44 mm/yr. During the warming phase in the Middle Subboreal period, the peat plateau was subjected to active thermal erosion; part of the peat was eroded. The processes of thermal erosion are also active at present and destroy the edges of peat mounds. At the same time, the gradual accumulation of peat on the plateau continues. An increase in the degree of peat mineralization is expected upon the establishment of aerobic conditions against the background degradation of the permafrost. Peat plateaus and large peat mounds have been the sinks of atmospheric carbon for a larger part of their history. In this context, we do not expect their significant negative influence on the climate in the future.

AB A drained boreal bog with active drainage ditches and the introduction of forage grass was compared with a natural bog site to assess the effect of agricultural drainage on the photosynthetic capacity of boreal peatlands. In this study, the net carbon dioxide uptake and the ecosystem respiration were measured using a pair of clear and dark chambers, connected to a greenhouse gas analyzer in order to estimate the gross primary production (GPP). Environmental factors, including photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), peat soil temperature, soil moisture, electrical conductivity and water table depth (WTD), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soil pore water were also investigated at each site. Our results confirmed a correlation between water table depth, peat soil temperature, electrical conductivity and peatland productivity. Changes in electrical conductivity, water table depth, and peat soil temperature together explained 61% of gross primary productivity variance at our drained peatland pasture site. In general, plant functional types/growth forms did not have any significant difference in their GPP at the drained site except shrubs which had a significantly higher GPP at PAR level greater than 1000 mu mol/m(2)/s (F(3,30.84) = 11.64, p < 0.001). At the natural site, GPP was significantly higher at the hollow (0.168 +/- 0.02 mg/m(2)/s) compared to the hummock (0.098 +/- 0.01 mg/m(2)/s) where relatively the higher WTD was recorded. We therefore concluded that water shortage to the shallow rooting depth of shrubs on our hummock subplots may be the cause of the low productivity. At PAR greater than 1000 mu mol/m(2)/s, productivity at the hollow was still significantly higher (0.17 +/- 0.002 mg/m(2)/s) compared to the hummock (0.10 +/- 0.00 mg/m(2)/s). This suggests that, for ecosystem carbon modelling, the minimum PAR level at which the GPP is estimated is very crucial. All the growth forms at the drained site recorded a significantly higher GPP than the microforms at the natural site. We speculate that not only hydrological changes via agricultural drainage can affect the carbon balance of boreal peatland ecosystem through photosynthesis, but also the hydrological changes in the peat due to the differences in peat soil makeup, structure and density. We, therefore, conclude that differences in microtopography and the corresponding changes in vegetation, land-use practice and its effects on peat soil properties and hydrology should be taken into account when modelling the gross primary production in a peatland ecosystem.

AB Peatlands constitute major sinks of organic carbon (C) and play a key role in the global C cycle. Here, we present a synthesis of peat records from six ecoclimatic regions in Quebec, Canada, in order to quantify Holocene patterns of C accumulation and relationships with contemporary climate data. Average long-term apparent rates of C accumulation (LORCA) were calculated for 21 peat cores and range from 10 to 70 g C/m(2)/yr with a mean of 26.1 (standard error of mean (SEM) = 3.6) g C/m(2)/yr, which is slightly higher than the mean value for northern peatlands as a whole (Loisel et al., 2014). We found that regional climate has been a major factor controlling long-term peatland C accumulation and that site-specific factors may explain some variability between sites. Our data show that LORCA tend to decrease with latitude. The lowest LORCA are found in the northernmost peatlands located at the boreal forest/forest-tundra ecotone, whereas the highest values are recorded in the peatlands along the St. Lawrence Estuary, characterized by the highest mean summer temperature, number of growing degree-days above 0 degrees C and mean annual precipitation. Temporal variations in Holocene C accumulations rates were synthesized for 16 peat cores, which show high values during the mid-Holocene (6000-4000 cal. yr BP) followed by a decline during the Neoglacial cooling, especially between 2000 and 1200 cal. yr BP. Our study contributes to a better understanding of sensitivity of peatland C balance to climate change in a poorly documented part of the circumboreal region.

AB Liming is a common management practice used to achieve optimum pH for plant growth in agricultural soils. Addition of lime to the soil, however, may Cause CO2 release when the carbonates in lime dissolve in water. Although lime may thereby constitute a significant carbon source, especially under acidic soil conditions, experimental data on the CO2 release are lacking so far. We conducted a split-plot experiment within a cut-away peatland cultivated with a bioenergy crop (reed canary grass, Phalaris arundinacea L) with lime and fertilizer treatments to determine effects of lime on the CO2 emissions from soil and to better understand mechanisms underlying liming effects. Carbon dioxide release was measured over two growing seasons in the field after liming, and complementary laboratory studies were conducted. To differentiate CO2 derived from lime and biotic respiration the delta C-13 of CO2 released was determined and the two-pool mixing model was applied. The results showed that lime may contribute significantly to CO2 release from the soil. In the laboratory, more than 50% of CO2 release was attributable to lime-carbonates during short-term incubation. Lime-derived CO2 emissions were much lower in the field, and were only detected during the first (2-4) months after the application. However, a maximum of 12% of monthly CO2 emissions from the cultivated peatland originated from the lime. Biotic respiration rates were similar in limed and unlimed soils, suggesting that higher pH did not, at least in the short-term, increase carbon losses from cultivated peat soils. Additional fertilization and acidification did not contribute to further CO2 release from the lime. According to our first estimations about one sixth of the lime applied would be released as CO2 from the managed peatland, with all lime-derived emissions occurring during the first year of application (equivalent to about 4.6% of the total annual CO2 losses from the soil in the first year). This suggests that the mass-balance approach as proposed by the IPCC Tier 1 methodology, which assumes that all carbon in lime ends up as CO2 in the atmosphere, overestimates the emissions from lime. Our study further shows that there is a great risk to overestimate heterotrophic microbial activity in limed soils by measuring the CO2 release without separating abiotic and biotic CO2 production.

AB Globally, peat lands are considered to be a sink of CO2, but a source when drained. Additionally, wet peat lands are thought to emit considerable amounts of CH4 and N2O. Hitherto, reliable and integrated estimates of emissions and emission factors for this type of land cover have been lacking and the effects of wetland restoration on methane emissions have been poorly quantified. In this paper we estimate the full greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of a restored natural peat land by determining the fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O through atmosphere and water, while accounting for the different Global Warming Potentials (GWP's).
   The site is an abandoned agricultural peat meadow, which has been converted into a wetland nature reserve ten years ago, after which the water level was raised. GHG fluxes were measured continuously with an eddy covariance system (CO2) and flux chamber measurements (CH4 and N2O). Meteorological and hydrological measurements were collected as well. With growing seasons of respectively 192, 168 and 129 days, the annual net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was -446+ +/- 83 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2004, -311 +/- 58 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2005 and -232 +/- 57 g m(-2) yr(-1) for 2006. Ecosystem respiration (Reco) was estimated as 869 +/- 668 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2004, 866 +/- 666 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2005 and 924 +/- 711 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2006. CH4 emissions from the saturated land and water surfaces were high compared to the relatively dry land. Annual weighted CH4 emissions were 31.27 +/- 20.40 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2005 and 32.27 +/- 21.08 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2006. N2O fluxes were too low to be of significance. The water balance of the area was dominated by precipitation and evapotranspiration and therefore fluxes of carbon and CH4 through seepage, infiltration and drainage were relatively small (17.25 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The carbon- balance consisted for the largest part of CO2 uptake, CO2 respiration and CH4 emission from water saturated land and water. CO2 emission has decreased significantly as result of the raised water table, while CH4 fluxes have increased. In GWP's the area was a small net GHG sink given as CO2- equiv. of - 86 g m(-2) yr(-1) (over a 100-year period).

AB Rapidly thawing permafrost harbors similar to 30 to 50% of global soil carbon, and the fate of this carbon remains unknown. Microorganisms will play a central role in its fate, and their viruses could modulate that impact via induced mortality and metabolic controls. Because of the challenges of recovering viruses from soils, little is known about soil viruses or their role(s) in microbial biogeochemical cycling. Here, we describe 53 viral populations (viral operational taxonomic units [vOTUs]) recovered from seven quantitatively derived (i.e., not multiple-displacement-amplified) viral-particle metagenomes (viromes) along a permafrost thaw gradient at the Stordalen Mire field site in northern Sweden. Only 15% of these vOTUs had genetic similarity to publicly available viruses in the RefSeq database, and similar to 30% of the genes could be annotated, supporting the concept of soils as reservoirs of substantial undescribed viral genetic diversity. The vOTUs exhibited distinct ecology, with different distributions along the thaw gradient habitats, and a shift from soil-virus like assemblages in the dry palsas to aquatic-virus-like assemblages in the inundated fen. Seventeen vOTUs were linked to microbial hosts (in silico), implicating viruses in infecting abundant microbial lineages from Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Deltaproteobacteria, including those encoding key biogeochemical functions such as organic matter degradation. Thirty auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) were identified and suggested virus-mediated modulation of central carbon metabolism, soil organic matter degradation, polysaccharide binding, and regulation of sporulation. Together, these findings suggest that these soil viruses have distinct ecology, impact host-mediated biogeochemistry, and likely impact ecosystem function in the rapidly changing Arctic.
   IMPORTANCE This work is part of a 10-year project to examine thawing permafrost peatlands and is the first virome-particle-based approach to characterize viruses in these systems. This method yielded > 2-fold-more viral populations (vOTUs) per gigabase of metagenome than vOTUs derived from bulk-soil metagenomes from the same site (J. B. Emerson, S. Roux, J. R. Brum, B. Bolduc, et al., Nat Microbiol 3:870-880, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-018-0190-y). We compared the ecology of the recovered vOTUs along a permafrost thaw gradient and found (i) habitat specificity, (ii) a shift in viral community identity from soil-like to aquatic-like viruses, (iii) infection of dominant microbial hosts, and (iv) carriage of host metabolic genes. These vOTUs can impact ecosystem carbon processing via top-down (inferred from lysing dominant microbial hosts) and bottom-up (inferred from carriage of auxiliary metabolic genes) controls. This work serves as a foundation which future studies can build upon to increase our understanding of the soil virosphere and how viruses affect soil ecosystem services.

AB We report here the carbon dioxide (CO2) budget of a 98.6 km(2) subarctic tundra area in northeast European Russia based on measurements at two different scales and two independent upscaling approaches. Plot-scale measurements (chambers on terrestrial surfaces, gas gradient method and bubble collectors on lakes) were carried out from July 2007 to October 2008. The landscape-scale eddy covariance (EC) measurements covered the snow-free period of 2008. The annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of different land cover types ranged from -251 to 84 g C m(-2). Leaf area index (LAI) was an excellent predictor of the spatial variability in gross photosynthesis (GP), NEE and ecosystem respiration (ER). The plot-scale CO2 fluxes were first scaled up to the EC source area and then to the whole study area using two data sets: a land cover classification and a LAI map, both based on field data and a 2.4 m pixel-sized Quick-Bird satellite image. The good agreement of the CO2 balances for the EC footprint based on the different measuring techniques (-105 to -81 g C m(-2) vs. -79 g C m(-2); growing season 2008) justified the integration of the plot-scale measurements over the larger area. The regional CO2 balance based on area-integrated plot-scale measurements was -41 or -79 g C m(-2) yr(-1) according to the two upscaling methods, the land cover classification and the LAI map, respectively. Due to the heterogeneity of tundra, the effect of climate change on CO2 uptake will vary strongly according to the land cover type and, moreover, likely changes in their relative coverage in the future will have great impact on the regional CO2 balance.

AB Black spruce (Picea mariana) peatlands play important ecologic and economic roles in the temperate-boreal region of North America, providing a valuable timber resource while also performing important ecosystem functions. Climate models project decreases in the amount of snowfall received throughout the temperate-boreal region by 2100, as average wintertime temperatures increase. We used a paired-plot experimental design to assess the effect of snow removal on soil temperature and frost development at six forested peatland sites in northern Minnesota, USA, during the three winters from 2017 to 2020. Treatments consisted of 1) removal of snow throughout the winter, or 2) ambient snow cover conditions. During the three years of the study, there was a significant effect of snow removal by mid-winter that continued into late winter and spring, where removal of snow increased soil frost depth compared to plots with ambient snow cover treatment. Soil temperatures in the removal plots were highly responsive to air temperature fluctuations to depths of 20 cm or more, whereas the ambient snow cover soils exhibited little fluctuation and degrees maintained temperatures near or above 0 C for much of the winter season. We found that each cumulative freezing degree day resulted in an average of 0.36 cm of soil frost development in snow removal plots, as compared to 0.07 cm depth in the ambient treatment plots. Soils were significantly colder through much of the summer growing season in the removal treatment compared to the ambient treatment, with detectable soil frost in the soil profile as late as mid- to late-June. These results indicate that predicted changes in wintertime precipitation may result in increased development of soil frost in forested peatland systems, although some of this effect may be offset by predicted concurrent increases in air temperature. We did not measure indicators of biological activity, but the large and prolonged reduction in soil temperature with snow removal is likely to depress biological activity throughout the growing season and the many ecosystem functions it influences. Because of the role that soil temperature and frost play on the hydrologic and ecological processes of peatlands, as well as the crucial role of soil frost in peatland forest management, findings of this study provide important insight into the potential effects of altered winter conditions on these expansive and ecologically important ecosystems.

AB Previous experimental studies suggest that methane emission from wetlands is influenced by multiple interactive pathways of gas production and transport through soil and sediment layers to the atmosphere. The objective of this study is to evaluate a new simulation model of methane production and emission in wetland soils that was developed initially to help identify key processes that regulate methanogenesis and net flux of CH4 to the air but which is designed ultimately for regional simulation using remotely sensed inputs for land cover characteristics. The foundation for these computer simulations is based on a well-documented model (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach, CASA) of ecosystem production and carbon cycling in the terrestrial biosphere. Modifications to represent flooded wetland soils and anaerobic decomposition include three new submodels for (1) layered soil temperature and water table depth (WTD) as a function of daily climate drivers, (2) CH4 production within the anoxic soil layer as a function of WTD and CO2 production under poorly drained conditions, and (3) CH4 gaseous transport pathways (molecular diffusion, ebullition, and plant vascular transport) as a function of WTD and ecosystem type. The model was applied and tested using climate and ecological data to characterize tundra wetland sites near Fairbanks, Alaska, studied previously by Whaler, and Reeburgh [1992]. Comparison of model predictions to measurements of soil temperature and thaw depth, water table depth, and CH4 emissions over a 2-year period suggest that intersite differences in soil physical conditions and methane fluxes could be reproduced accurately for selected periods. Day-to-day comparison of predicted emissions to measured CH4 flux rates reveals good agreement during the early part of the thaw season, but the model tends to underestimate production of CH4 during the months of July and August in both test years. Important seasonal effects, including that of falling WTD during these periods, are apparently overlooked in the model formulation. Nevertheless, reasonably close agreement was achieved between the model's mean daily and seasonal estimates of CH4 flux and observed emission rates for northern wetland ecosystems. Several features of the model are identified as crucial to more accurate prediction of wetland methane emission, including the capacity to incorporate influences of localized topographic and hydrologic features on site-specific soil temperature and WTD dynamics and mechanistic simulation of methane emission transport pathways from within the soil profile.

AB High latitude peatlands act as globally important carbon (C) sinks and are in constant interaction with the atmosphere. Their C storage formed during the Holocene. In the course of time, the aggregate effect of the C fluxes on radiative forcing (RF) typically changes from warming to cooling, but the timing of this shift varies among different peatlands. Here we investigated Holocene peatland development, including vegetation history, vertical peat growth and the lateral expansion of a patterned subarctic fen in northern Finland by means of multiple sampling points. We modelled the Holocene RF by combining knowledge on past vegetation communities based on plant macrofossil stratigraphies and present in situ C flux measurements. The peatland initiated at ca. 9500 calibrated years Before Present (cal yr BP), and its lateral expansion was greatest between ca. 9000 and 7000 cal yr BP. After the early expansion, vertical peat growth proceeded very differently in different parts of the peatland, regulated by internal and external factors. The pronounced surface microtopography, with high strings and wet (larks, started to form only after ca. 1000 cal yr BP. C accumulation within the peatland recorded a high degree of spatial variability throughout its history, including the recent past. We applied two flux scenarios with different interpretation of the initial peatland development phases to estimate the RF induced by C fluxes of the fen. After ca. 4000 cal yr BP, at the latest, the peatland RF has been negative (cooling), mainly driven by C uptake and biomass production, while methane emissions had a lesser role in the total RF. Interestingly, these scenarios suggest that the greatest cooling effect took place around ca. 1000 cal yr BP, after which the surface microtopography established. The study demonstrated that despite the high spatial heterogeneity and idiosyncratic behaviour of the peatland, the RF of the studied fen followed the general development pattern of more southern peatlands. Holocene climate variations and warm phases did not seem to induce any distinctive and consistent peatland-scale patterns in C accumulation, whereas our data suggests that the changes in vegetation related to autogenic succession were reflected in the C accumulation patterns and RF more clearly.

AB Globally peatlands store 500 Gt carbon (C), with northern blanket bogs accumulating 23 g C m(-2) y(-1) due to cool wet conditions. As a sink of carbon dioxide (CO2) peat bogs slow anthropogenic climate change, but warming climate increases the likelihood of drought which may reduce net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and increase soil respiration, tipping C sinks to sources. High water tables make bogs a globally important source of methane (CH4), another greenhouse gas (GHG) with a global warming potential (GWP) 34 times that of CO2. Warming may increase CH4 emissions, but drying may cause a reduction. Predicted species composition changes may also influence GHG balance, due to different traits such as erenchyma, e.g., Eriophorum vaginatum (eriophorum) and non-aerenchymatous species, e.g., Calluna vulgaris (heather). To understand how these ecosystems will respond to climate change, it is vital to measure GHG responses to drought at the species level. An automated chamber system, SkyLine2D, measured NEE and CH4 fluxes near-continuously from an ombrotrophic fen from August 2017 to September 2019. Four ecotypes were identified: sphagnum (Sphagnum spp), eriophorum, heather and water, hypothesizing that fluxes would significantly differ between ecotypes. The 2018 drought allowed comparison of fluxes between drought and non-drought years (May to September), and their recovery the following year. Methane emissions differed between ecotypes (p < 0.02), ordered high to low: eriophorum > sphagnum > water > heather, ranging from 23 to 8 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1). Daily NEE was similar between ecotypes (p > 0.7), but under 2018 drought conditions all ecotypes were greater sources of CO2 compared to 2019, losing 1.14 g and 0.24 g CO2-C m(-2) d(-1) respectively (p < 0.001). CH4 emissions were ca. 40% higher during 2018 than 2019, 17 mg compared to 12 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) (p < 0.0001), and fluxes exhibited hysteresis with water table depth. A lag of 84-88 days was observed between rising water table and increased CH4 emissions. A significant interaction between ecotype and year showed fluxes from open water did not return to pre-drought levels. Our findings suggest that short-term drought may lead to a net increase in C emissions from northern wetlands.

AB Background: Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle. They provide important ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and storage. Drainage disturbs peatland ecosystem services. Mapping drains is difficult and expensive and their spatial extent is, in many cases, unknown. An object based image analysis (OBIA) was performed on a very high resolution satellite image (Geoeye-1) to extract information about drain location and extent on a blanket peatland in Ireland. Two accuracy assessment methods: Error matrix and the completeness, correctness and quality (CCQ) were used to assess the extracted data across the peatland and at several sub sites. The cost of the OBIA method was compared with manual digitisation and field survey. The drain maps were also used to assess the costs relating to blocking drains vs. a business-as-usual scenario and estimating the impact of each on carbon fluxes at the study site.
   Results: The OBIA method performed well at almost all sites. Almost 500 km of drains were detected within the peatland. In the error matrix method, overall accuracy (OA) of detecting the drains was 94% and the kappa statistic was 0.66. The OA for all sub-areas, except one, was 95-97%. The CCQ was 85%, 85% and 71% respectively. The OBIA method was the most cost effective way to map peatland drains and was at least 55% cheaper than either field survey or manual digitisation, respectively. The extracted drain maps were used constrain the study area CO(2 )flux which was 19% smaller than the prescribed Peatland Code value for drained peatlands.
   Conclusions: The OBIA method used in this study showed that it is possible to accurately extract maps of fine scale peatland drains over large areas in a cost effective manner. The development of methods to map the spatial extent of drains is important as they play a critical role in peatland carbon dynamics. The objective of this study was to extract data on the spatial extent of drains on a blanket bog in the west of Ireland. The results show that information on drain extent and location can be extracted from high resolution imagery and mapped with a high degree of accuracy. Under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol Annex 1 parties can account for greenhouse gas emission by sources and removals by sinks resulting from "wetlands drainage and rewetting". The ability to map the spatial extent, density and location of peatlands drains means that Annex 1 parties can develop strategies for drain blocking to aid reduction of CO2 emissions, DOC runoff and water discoloration. This paper highlights some uncertainty around using one-size-fits-all emission factors for GHG in drained peatlands and re-wetting scenarios. However, the OBIA method is robust and accurate and could be used to assess the extent of drains in peatlands across the globe aiding the refinement of peatland carbon dynamics.

AB We studied methanotrophic activity in the water column in relation to heterotrophic bacterial production and efflux of methane (CH4) from the take surface in a small, stratified, humic, boreal lake (Valkea-Kotinen, southern Finland). During summer and winter stratification, the highest methanotrophic activities were in the metalimnion, where oxygen concentration was < 6 mmol m(-3). During an incomplete spring turnover and summer stratification period, 3-5 times more CH4 was consumed by methanotrophs in the water column than was released to the atmosphere. The highest CH4 effluxes (1.2-5.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) to the atmosphere Occurred during the autumnal turnover despite observed methanotrophic activity in the whole water column. In winter, the amount of CH4 consumed by methanotrophs (0.20 mol CH4 m(-2) during 6.5 months) was of the same order of magnitude as that during the ice-free period (0.22 mol CH4 m(-2) during 5.5 months), Annually similar to 80% of CH4 diffused from the sediment was consumed by methanotrophs in the water column, and only 20% (0.11 mol CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)) was released to the atmosphere. During the ice-free period, bacterial production measured as [C-14]leucine uptake showed a bell-shaped relation to CH4 concentration. The highest production was found in the metalimnion at CH4 concentrations ranging from 5 to 10 mmol m(-3). During summer stratification, net production of methanotrophs corresponded to 23-47% of total bacterial production, but during the autumn turnover, this proportion was higher (27-81%), indicating that methanotrophs offer a potentially significant Source of carbon to zooplankton in stratified humic lakes.

AB We conducted a soil warming experiment in a cool-temperate forested peatland in northern Japan during the snow-free seasons of 2007-2011, to determine whether the soil warming would change the heterotrophic respiration rate and its temperature sensitivity. We elevated the soil temperature by 3 degrees C at 5-cm depth by using overhead infrared heaters and continuously measured hourly soil CO2 fluxes with a 15-channel automated chamber system. The 15 chambers were divided into three groups each with five replications for the control, unwarmed-trenched and warmed-trenched treatments. Soil warming enhanced heterotrophic respiration by 82% (mean of four seasons (2008-2011) observation +/- SD, 6.84 +/- 2.22 mu mol C m(-2) s(-1)) as compared to the unwarmed-trenched treatment (3.76 +/- 0.98 mu mol C m(-2) s(-1)). The sustained enhancement of heterotrophic respiration with soil warming suggests that global warming will accelerate the loss of carbon substantially more from forested peatlands than from other upland forest soils. Soil warming likewise enhanced temperature sensitivity slightly (Q(10), 3.1 +/- 0.08 and 3.3 +/- 0.06 in the four-season average in unwarmed- and warmed-trenched treatments, respectively), and significant effect was observed in 2009 (p<0.001) and 2010 (p<0.01). However, there was no significant difference in the basal respiration rate at 10 degrees C (R-10, 2.2 +/- 0.52 and 2.8 +/- 1.2 mmol C m(-2) s(-1)) between treatments, although the values tended to be high by warming throughout the study period. These results suggest that global warming will enhance not only the heterotrophic respiration rate itself but also its Q(10) in forests with high substrate availability and without severe water stress, and predictions for such ecosystems obtained by using models assuming no change in Q(10) are likely to underestimate the carbon release from the soil to the atmosphere in a future warmer environment.

AB Peatlands are important sources of fluvial carbon. Previous research has shown that riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations are largely controlled by soil type. However, there has been little work to establish the controls of riverine DOC within blanket peatlands that have not undergone major disturbance from drainage or burning. A total of 119 peatland catchments were sampled for riverine DOC and water colour across three drainage basins during six repeated sampling campaigns. The topographic characteristics of each catchment were determined from digital elevation models. The dominant vegetation cover was mapped using 0.5 m resolution colour infrared aerial images, with ground-truthed validation revealing 82% accuracy. Forward and backward stepwise regression modelling showed that mean slope was a strong (and negative) determinant of DOC and water colour in blanket peatland river waters. There was a weak role for plant functional type in determining DOC and water colour. At the basin scale, there were major differences between the models depending on the basin. The dominance of topographic predictors of DOC found in our study, combined with a weaker role of vegetation type, paves the way for developing improved planning tools for water companies operating in peatland catchments. Using topographic data and aerial imagery it will be possible to predict which tributaries will typically yield lower DOC concentrations and which are therefore more suitable and cost-effective as raw water intakes.

AB Peat soils represent an important global carbon (C) sink, but can also provide a highly fertile medium for growing horticultural crops. Sustainable crop production on peat soils involves a trade-off between ensuring food security and mitigating typically high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and rates of soil C loss. An alternative approach to resource intensive field-based monitoring of GHG fluxes for all potential management scenarios is to use a process-based model driven by existing field data to estimate emissions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of the Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model for estimating emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4 from horticultural peat soils. The model was parameterised using climatic, soil, and crop management data from two intensively cultivated sites on soils of contrasting soil organic matter (SOM) contents ( similar to 35% and similar to 70% SOM content). Simulated emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4, and simulated soil physical and crop output values, were compared to actual GHG, soil and crop measurements. Model performance was assessed using baseline parameterisation (i.e. model defaults), then calibrated using pre-simulation and sensitivity analysis processes. Under baseline parameterisation conditions, DNDC proved poor at predicting GHG emissions and soil/crop variables. Calibration and validation improved DNDC performance in estimating the annual magnitude of emissions, but model refinement is still required for reproducing seasonal GHG patterns in particular. Key constraints on model functioning appear to be its ability to reliably model soil moisture and some aspects of C and nitrogen dynamics, as well as the quality of input data relating to water table dynamics. In conclusion, our results suggest that the DNDC (v. 9.5) model cannot accurately reproduce or be used to replace actual field measurements for estimation of GHG emission factors under different management scenarios for horticultural peat soils, but may be able to do so with further modification.

AB Much uncertainty still exists regarding spatial and temporal variability of stable isotope ratios ((13)C/(12)C and D/H) in different CH(4)-emission sources. Such variability is especially prevalent in freshwater wetlands where a range of processes can influence stable isotope compositions, resulting in variations of up to similar to 50 parts per thousand for delta(13)C-CH(4) and similar to 150 parts per thousand for delta D-CH(4) values. Within a temperate-zone bog and marsh situated in southwestern Ontario, Canada, gas bubbles in pond sediments exhibit only minor seasonal and spatial variation in delta(13)C-CH(4), delta D-CH(4) and delta(13)C-CO(2) values. In pond sediments, CO(2) appears to be the main source of carbon during methanogenesis either directly via CO(2) reduction or indirectly through dissimilation of autotrophic acetate. In contrast, CH(4) production occurs primarily via acetate fermentation at shallow depths in peat soils adjacent to ponds at each wetland. At greater depths within soils, Sigma CO(2) and H(2)O increasingly exert an influence on delta(13)C- and delta D-CH(4) values. Secondary alteration processes (e.g., methanotrophy or diffusive transport) are unlikely to be responsible for depth-related changes in stable isotope values of CH(4). Recent models that attempt to predict delta D-CH(4) values in freshwater environments from D/H ratios in local precipitation do not adequately account for such changes with depth. Subenvironments (i.e., soil-forming and open water areas) in wetlands should be considered separately with respect to stable isotope signatures in CH(4) emission models.

AB Peatland drainage is an important driver of global soil carbon loss and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Restoration of peatlands by reflooding reverses CO2 losses at the cost of increased methane (CH4) emissions, presenting a biogeochemical compromise. While restoring peatlands is a potentially effective method for sequestering carbon, the terms of this compromise are not well constrained. Here we present 14 site years of continuous CH4 and CO2 ecosystem-scale gas exchange over a network of restored freshwater wetlands in California, where long growing seasons, warm weather, and managed water tables result in some of the largest wetland ecosystem CH4 emissions recorded. These large CH4 emissions cause the wetlands to be strong greenhouse gas sources while sequestering carbon and building peat soil. The terms of this biogeochemical compromise, dictated by the ratio between carbon sequestration and CH4 emission, vary considerably across small spatial scales, despite nearly identical wetland climate, hydrology, and plant community compositions.
   Plain Language Summary Wetlands play an important role in the climate system, with restoration commonly undertaken for the benefit of atmospheric carbon dioxide removal and carbon storage in the soil. While flooded conditions suppress carbon dioxide emissions from decomposition and sequester carbon, they also generate methane, another potent heat-trapping greenhouse gas. Understanding the balance between these exchanges is important to our understanding of how restored or created wetlands will contribute to mitigating climate change. Here we present a long-term record of continuous carbon dioxide and methane exchange from restored wetlands in Northern California to understand the ultimate climate impact of wetland restoration.

AB Downstream mineralization and sedimentation of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) render lakes important for landscape carbon cycling in the boreal region. The chemical composition of terrestrial DOC, the downstream delivery of terrestrial DOC and its processing within aquatic ecosystem may all be influenced by climate change, including increased occurrence of wildfire. Here, we assessed composition and lability (during both dark-and UV incubations) of DOC from peatland groundwater and mineral soil groundwater, and from shallow lakes within a peatland-rich region on the Boreal Plains of western Canada that was recently affected by wildfire. Wildfire was found to increase aromaticity of DOC in peat pore water above the water table, but had no effect on the concentrations or composition of peatland groundwater DOC or mineral soil DOC. Using a mixing model we estimated that on average 98 and 78% of terrestrial DOC inputs to the lakes in fine-and coarse-textured settings, respectively, originated from peatland groundwater sources. Accordingly, lake DOC composition reflected primarily a mixing of peatland and mineral soil groundwater sources, with no detectable influence of the recent wildfire. Lake and peatland DOC had low biodegradability, lower than that of mineral soil DOC. However, both mineralization and sedimentation of peatland DOC increased substantially during UV incubations through selective removal of aromatic humic and fulvic acids. Similar shifts in DOC composition as observed during the UV incubations were also observed across lakes with longer water residence times. The mixing model estimated that on average 54% (95% confidence interval: 36-64%) of terrestrial DOC had been removed in lakes as a result of mineralization and sedimentation. Meanwhile, the reduction in absorbance at 254 nm was 71% (58-76%), which suggests selective removal of aromatic DOC. Hence, incubation results, patterns of DOC composition among lakes and mixing model results were consistent with significant within-lake removal of terrestrial DOC through UV-mediated processes. Selective removal of highly aromatic DOC through UV-mediated processes implies that organic sources that are considered stabile in terrestrial ecosystems can be readily mineralized once entering aquatic ecosystems. Together, our results suggest that regional characteristics (climate, surface geology and lake morphometry) can prevent wildfire from causing pulse perturbations to the linkages between terrestrial and aquatic C cycling and also regulate the processes that dominate within-lake removal of terrestrial DOC.

AB Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) loading has the potential to affect plant community structure and function, and the carbon dioxide (CO2) sink of peatlands. Our aim is to study how vegetation changes, induced by nutrient input, affect the CO2 exchange of a nutrient-limited bog. We conducted 9- and 4-year fertilization experiments at Mer Bleue bog, where we applied N addition levels of 1.6, 3.2, and 6.4 g N m(-2) a(-1), upon a background deposition of about 0.8 g N m(-2) a(-1), with or without phosphorus and potassium (PK). Only the treatments 3.2 and 6.4 g N m(-2) a(-1) with PK significantly affected CO2 fluxes. These treatments shifted the Sphagnum moss and dwarf shrub community to taller dwarf shrub thickets without moss, and the CO2 responses depended on the phase of vegetation transition. Overall, compared to the large observed changes in the vegetation, the changes in CO2 fluxes were small. Following Sphagnum loss after 5 years, maximum ecosystem photosynthesis (Pg(max)) and net CO2 exchange (NEEmax) were lowered (-19 and -46%, respectively) in the highest NPK treatment. In the following years, while shrub height increased, the vascular foliar biomass did not fully compensate for the loss of moss biomass; yet, by year 8 there were no significant differences in Pg(max) and NEEmax between the nutrient and the control treatments. At the same time, an increase (24-32%) in ecosystem respiration (ER) became evident. Trends in the N-only experiment resembled those in the older NPK experiment by the fourth year. The increasing ER with increasing vascular plant and decreasing Sphagnum moss biomass across the experimental plots suggest that high N deposition may lessen the CO2 sink of a bog.

AB Bacteria of Dechloromonas were recognized as potential functional important denitrifiers in a long-term shell sand-amended peat soil. Different microcosms in a solid matrix and slurry systems with the addition of carbon and nitrogen sources, for example, clover leaves, glutamate and nitrate, were established. The bacterial community structures were analysed by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to select the conditions for enriching bacteria of Dechloromonas. The results showed that a relatively even bacterial community in the initial soil shifted to communities dominated by a few types of nitrate-reducing bacteria after the incubation, which strongly responded to the carbon substrates addition and consumption. The bacteria of several genera including Dechloromonas, Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Aeromonas and Ferribacterium were significantly enriched after a certain period of time. The bacteria of Dechloromonas became one of the most predominant bacteria in the incubated community. Especially when added the mixed carbon substrates into the solid soil matrix, as high as 34% of abundance was detected. This study proved that the functional important bacteria from the genus of Dechloromonas could be enriched to an extremely high abundance by using proper culture condition which will benefit to the isolation or direct metagenomics study for Dechloromonas.

AB Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 was measured in four peatlands along plant community, hydrologic, and water chemistry gradients from bog to rich fen in a diverse peatland complex near Thompson, Manitoba, as part of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). A simple model for estimating growing season net ecosystem productivity (NEP) using continuous measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and peat temperature was constructed with weekly chamber measurements of NEE from May to October 1996. The model explained 79-83% of the variation in NEE across the four sites. Model estimation and parameter uncertainty calculations were performed using nonlinear regression analyses with a maximum likelihood objective function. The model underestimated maximum NEE and respiration during the midseason when the standard errors for each parameter were greatest. On a daily basis, uncertainty in the midday NEE simulation was higher than at night. Although the magnitude of both photosynthesis and respiration rates followed the trophic gradient bog less than poor fen less than intermediate fen less than rich fen, NEP did not follow the same pattern. NEP in the bog and rich fen was close to zero, while the poor and intermediate fens had higher NEP due to a greater imbalance between uptake and release of CO2. Although all sites had a positive growing season NEP, upper and lower 95% confidence limits showed that the bog and rich fen were either a source or sink of CO2 to the atmosphere, while the sedge-dominated poor and intermediate fens were accumulating approximately 20-100 g CO2 C m(-2) over the 5 month period in 1996. Peatland ecosystems may switch from a net sink to a source of carbon on short timescales with small changes in soil temperature or water table position. Since the difference between production and decomposition is small, it is important to understand and quantify the magnitude of uncertainty in these measurements in order to predict the effect of climatic change on peatland carbon exchange.

AB Temperate Highland Peat Swamps on Sandstone (THPSS) are located at the headwaters of streams on low relief plateaus of Eastern Australia. Swamp sediment structure has a direct link to the high water tables, element cycling and carbon sequestration that are the characteristic functions of these systems. By comparing the sediment structure of intact swamps and channelised fills, we can gain an understanding of how changes in swamp geomorphology change both swamp structure and function. We examined the sedimentology of six intact and six channelised fill swamps in the Blue Mountains NSW, Australia. There were significant differences in texture, unit thickness, Carbon: Nitrogen (C:N) ratios and moisture content between intact swamps and channelised fills. The presence and thickness of unmodified contemporary sand layers in almost all channelised fills and its absence in almost all intact swamps was a distinctive structural difference. The two functional swamp layers, in terms of water and carbon storage were almost double the mean thickness in intact swamps than in channelised fills. Moisture content was 30% higher in intact swamps than in channelised fills. Mean C:N ratios for channelised fills were 25% lower than that of intact swamps. Peat forming potential, as defined by C:N ratios >27, started at a greater depth in the sediment profile (0.9 m lower) in channelised fills than in intact swamps. It is clear from this study that these structural and functional indicators are important for assessing swamp condition and can also be useful in designing monitoring programs for management and rehabilitation that target key structural attributes that produce and maintain swamp function.

AB Substantially extending the life span of peat- and perlite-based growing media is a measure to increase the sustainability of soilless cultivation. The extraction of peat from pristine peatlands threatens these sensitive ecosystems and carbon sinks, meanwhile resulting in increased emissions of greenhouse gasses. Each batch of peat that is reused, results in a clear reduction in CO2 emissions and a lower impact on the climate. After using growing media for one cultivation, we aim at reusing the spent material as growing medium for another crop. Spent peat and perlite-based growing media from strawberry and cucumber cultivation were upcycled after steam treatment. We tested the effectiveness of steaming to reduce phytosanitary risks. The hygienisation efficiency of the steam treatment was confirmed: plant pathogenic fungi, larvae of vine weevils and weed seeds added or already present before the process were killed by the steam treatment. As the upcycled spent growing medium already contained high nutrient levels, the fertilizer application in the reused growing medium should be reduced, especially for P and K. Five indicators for assessing stability of the materials were used: CO2 flux measurements, oxygen uptake rate (OUR), biodegradation potential, mineral N content and risk for N immobilization. The spent growing media had a low decomposition rate and the release of nutrients in a leaching experiment was lower than for a fertilized peat-based growing medium, being a reference blend for open field cultivated Chrysanthemum. N mineralisation and P uptake were tested in an incubation and pot trial, respectively, and the upcycled spent growing medium was found to be an important source of plant-available K and P. Steam treatment did not severely affect the microbial biomass and diversity of the spent growing media. Blending the steam-treated spent media with other materials or inoculating by a commercially available biocontrol fungus also had a limited effect, indicating that newly introduced microorganisms do not easily establish in steamed-treated spent growing media (SSGM). Acidification of the SSGM was achieved by a low dose of elemental S. The steam-treated growing medium was tested for growing Chrysanthemum cuttings and plantlets. Spent growing media were not able to supply sufficient mineral N, but the stored amounts of P and K in the media were sufficiently plant available for optimal crop growth. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB The high-arctic environment is an environment where the consequences of global warming may be significant. In this paper we report on findings on carbon dioxide and water vapour fluxes above a sedge-dominated fen at Zackenberg (74 degrees 28'N, 20 degrees 34' W) in The National Park of North and East Greenland. Eddy covariance measurements were initiated at the start of the growing season and terminated shortly before its end lasting 45 days. The net CO2 nux during daytime reaches a high of 10 mu mol m(-2)s(-1), and around the summer solstice, net CO2 assimilation occurred at midnight, resulting in net carbon gain during the night. The measured carbon dioxide fluxes compare well to estimates based on the photosynthesis model by Collatz et al. (1991). The total growing-season net ecosystem CO2 exchange was estimated to be 96 g cm(-2) based on the carbon dioxide model and micrometeorological data. Finally, the combined CO2 assimilation and soil respiration models are used for examining the dependence of the carbon dioxide budget on temperature. The ecosystem is found to function optimally given the present temperature conditions whereas either an increase or a decrease in temperature would reduce the ecosystem CO2 accumulation. An increase in temperature by 5 degrees C would turn the ecosystem into a carbon dioxide source.

AB Biochar, coal produced by pyrolysis and used as an amendment, has several advantages and has proven to be a promising avenue for sustainable agriculture. However, the current manufacturing methods, the conditions of pyrolysis and the biomasses used produce biochars of very variable qualities which can differently affect the productivity of the ground and the outputs of plants. Currently, no study makes it possible to elucidate the influence of the physicochemical properties of the biochars on the structure and the microbial diversity of the soil. The aim of this review was to understand how the physicochemical properties of a biochar affect its capacity: to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases; to improve the growth of hothouse plants; to improve the effectiveness of the use of manures and water; and to modify the structure and the diversity of the bacterial communities in a horticultural substrate and a mineral soil. These biochars were produced under various conditions. The analyses show that the addition of biochar can stimulate certain groups of bacteria involved in carbon and nitrogen cycles and possibly those involved in the development of plants. This review identifies the important physicochemical properties of the biochars, which will be able to better guide agricultural producers and industries manufacturing substrates containing peat, in the choice of a biochar favorable to the growth of plants and a more durable agriculture.

AB Petrographical and geochemical data of gelified and ungelified fossil wood from the Early Miocene Oberdorf lignite seam (Styrian Basin, Austria) provide evidence that the early diagenetic, aerobic degradation of wood by fungi may be followed by further decomposition under reducing conditions by the activity of anaerobic bacteria. Based on the molecular compositions of terpenoid hydrocarbons, the wood fragments in the lignite are identified as gymnosperms. This result is corroborated by the mean isotopic composition (delta(13)C = -24.2parts per thousand) of the macrofossils. The isotopic difference between fossil wood and extracted cellulose of most samples (3.9-2.5parts per thousand) is higher than in modern trees, which can be explained by the smaller effect of C-13 discrimination during decomposition of cellulose when compared with wood. The mean carbon isotope values found for gymnosperms and coals (-24.2parts per thousand and -24.7parts per thousand, respectively) confirm the results from biomarker analyses indicating that the peat-forming vegetation of the Oberdorf seam was dominated by gymnosperm taxa. Minor variation in the relative contributions of gymnosperms and angiosperms to coal deposition is of negligible influence on the isotopic composition of the coals. Cross-correlations between delta(13)C of the coals, soluble organic matter yield, and the proportions of liptinite macerals of higher-plant origin imply that the carbon isotopic composition may be affected by the contents of plant lipids because of their delta(13)C values ranging from 5 to 10parts per thousand less than whole-plant tissue values. An isotopic shift of the coals towards more negative values due to the activity of prokaryotes (i.e. anaerobic bacteria) in organic matter degradation is proposed. The results obtained from the Early Miocene Oberdorf lignite indicate that the carbon isotope ratios of,the coals are primarily affected by varying contributions of different parts of whole-plant tissue, due to their different isotopic and molecular compositions (e.g. epicuticular leaf waxes, resins, wood) and their different decay-resistance against the early diagenetic changes involved in organic matter decomposition. Carbon cycling during anoxic decomposition of plant-derived organic matter is assumed to affect the delta(13)C values of. coal. delta(13)C Values of wood and extracted cellulose are affected only to a minor extent.

AB For confidently estimating the amount of carbon stored in boreal forest soil, better knowledge of smaller regions is needed,In order to estimate the amount of soil C in forests on mineral soil in Finland, i.e. excluding peatland forests, and illustrate the regional patterns of the storage, statistical models were first made for the C densities of the organic and 0-1 m mineral soil layers. A forest type, which indicated site productivity, and the effective temperature sum were used as explanatory variables of the models, In addition, a constant C density was applied for the soil layer below the depth of 1 m on sorted sediments. Using these models the C densities were calculated for a total of 46673 sites of the National Forest Inventory (NFI). The amount of the soil C was then calculated in two ways: 1) weighting the C densities of the NFI sites by the land area represented by these sites and 2) interpolating the C densities of the NFI sites for 4 ha blocks to cover the whole land area of Finland and summing up the blocks on forested mineral soil. The soil C storage totalled 1109 Tg and 1315 Tg, when calculated by the areal weighting and the interpolated blocks, respectively. Of that storage, 28% was in the organic layer, 68% in the 0-1 m mineral soil layer and 4% in the layer below 1 m. The total soil C equals more than two times the amount of C in tree biomass and 20% of the amount of C in peat in Finland. Soil C maps made using the interpolated blocks indicated that the largest soil C reserves are located in central parts of southern Finland. The C storage of the organic layer was assessed to be overestimated at largest by 13% and that of the 0-1 m mineral soil layer by 29%. The largest error in the organic layer estimate is associated with the effects of forest harvesting and in the mineral soil estimate with the stone content of the soil.

AB Northern forests and peatlands are globally significant elements in carbon (C) cycling. Recent research has also highlighted the role of aquatic ecosystems in landscape C budgets. We measured contemporary carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange, lateral C transfer (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CO2, CH4), and long-term C accumulation in a peatland-stream-lake-continuum in north boreal Finland. On an annual scale the peatland, a rich fen, was a relatively strong C sink (27 g Cm-2 a(-1)). The stream that traversed through the fen had high CO2 and CH4 effluxes (on average 480 and 12 g C m(-2) a(-1), respectively) to the atmosphere, while the small oligotrophic lake was a small C gas source per unit area (15 g C m(-2) a(-1)). A catchment C budget was compiled by supplementing these measured values with literature values for the forests. The aquatic C fluxes equaled similar to 13% of the net C input by the forest and peatlands in the catchment, and the largest component was the downstream transfer of DOC. This study supports the proposition that ignoring the aquatic component would result in an overestimated regional C uptake. The contemporary net C input estimate for the fen, after accounting for the C transfer, was larger than the long-term C accumulation rate based on peat cores (22 versus 6.3-16.0 g C m(-2) a(-1)). This study provides reference values for both the contemporary C exchange and long-term C accumulation history, and the terrestrial-aquatic linkage from the boreal-subarctic ecotone, which is vulnerable to ongoing climatic change.

AB Soil respiration (R-s) is the largest flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) next to photosynthesis in terrestrial ecosystems. With the absorption of atmospheric methane (CH4), upland soils become a large CO2 source and CH4 sink. These soil carbon (C) fluxes are key factors in the mitigation and adaption of future climate change. The Asian region spans an extensive area from the northern boreal to tropical regions in Southeast Asia. As this region is characterised by highly diverse ecosystems, it is expected to experience the strong impact of ecosystem responses to global climate change. For the past two decades, researchers in the AsiaFlux community have meaningfully contributed to improve the current understanding of soil C dynamics, response of soil C fluxes to disturbances and climate change, and regional and global estimation based on model analysis. This review focuses on five important aspects: 1) the historical methodology for soil C flux measurement; 2) responses of soil C flux components to environmental factors; 3) soil C fluxes in typical ecosystems in Asia; 4) the influence of disturbance and climate change on soil C fluxes; and 5) model analysis and the estimation of soil C fluxes in research largely focused in Asia.

AB Eutrophication is a major threat for the persistence of nutrient-poor fens, as multilevel feedbacks on decomposition rates could trigger carbon loss and increase nutrient cycling. Here, we experimentally investigate the effects of macronutrient (NPK) enrichment on litter quality of six species of sedge (Carex sp.), which we relate to litter decomposition rates in a nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich environment. Our research focused on four levels: we examined how eutrophication alters (1) fresh litter production (productivity shift), (2) litter stoichiometry within the same species (intraspecific shift), (3) overall litter stoichiometry of the vegetation under the prediction that low-competitive species are outcompeted by fast-growing competitors (interspecific shift), and (4) litter decomposition rates due to an altered external environment (e.g., shifts in microbial activity; exogenous shift). Eutrophication triggered a strong increase in fresh litter production. Moreover, individuals of the same species produced litter with lower C:N and C:P ratios, higher K contents, and lower lignin, Ca and Mg contents (intraspecific shift), which increased litter decomposability. In addition, species typical for eutrophic conditions produced more easily degradable litter than did species typical for nutrient-poor conditions (interspecific shift). However, the effects of nutrient loading of the external environment (exogenous shift) were contradictory. Here, interactions between litter type and ambient nutrient level indicate that the (exogenous) effects of eutrophication on litterdecomposition rates are strongly dependent of litter quality. Moreover, parameters of litter quality only correlated with decomposition rates for litter incubated in nutrient-poor environments, but not in eutrophic environments. This suggests that rates of litter decomposition can be uncoupled from litter stoichiometry under eutrophic conditions. In conclusion, our results show that eutrophication affects litter accumulation and -decomposition at multiple levels, in which stimulatory and inhibitory effects interact. The cumulative effect of these interactions ultimately determine whether peatlands remain sinks or become sources of carbon under eutrophic conditions.

AB Arthrobacter species strain FR-3, isolated from sediments of a swamp, produced a novel serine-type sulfide oxidase. The production of sulfide oxidase was maximal at pH 7.5 and 30 degrees C. Among various carbon and nitrogen sources tested, glucose and yeast extract were found to be the most effective substrates for the secretion of sulfide oxidase. The sulfide oxidase was purified to homogeneity and the molecular weight of the purified enzyme was 43 kDa when estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified sulfide oxidase can be effectively immobilized in DEAE (diethylaminoethyl)cellulose matrix with a yield of 66%. The purified free and immobilized enzyme had optimum activity at pH 7.5 and 6.0, respectively. Immobilization increases the stability of the enzyme with respect to temperature. The half-life of the immobilized enzyme was 30 min at 45 degrees C, longer than that of the free enzyme (10 min). The purified free sulfide oxidase activity was completely inhibited by 1 mM Co2+ and Zn2+ and sulfhydryl group reagents (para-chloromercuribenzoic acid and iodoacetic acid). Catalytic activity was not affected by 1 mM Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and metal-chelating agent (EDTA). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bogs are globally important sinks of atmospheric carbon (C) due to the accumulation of partially decomposed litter that forms peat. Because bogs receive their nutrients from the atmosphere, the world-wide increase of nitrogen (N) deposition is expected to affect litter decomposition and, ultimately, the rate of C accumulation. However, the mechanism of such biogeochemical alteration remains unclear and quantification of the effect of N addition on litter accumulation has yet to be done. Here, we show that 7 similar to years of N addition to a bog decreased the C similar to N ratio, increased the bacterial biomass and stimulated the activity of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes in surface peat. Furthermore, N addition modified nutrient limitation of microbes during litter decomposition so that phosphorus became a primary limiting nutrient. Alteration of N release from decomposing litter affected bog water chemistry and the competitive balance between peat-forming mosses and vascular plants. We estimate that deposition of about 4 g similar to N similar to m-2 similar to yr-1 will cause a mean annual reduction of fresh litter C accumulation of about 40 similar to g similar to m-2 primarily as a consequence of decreased litter production from peat-forming mosses. Our findings show that N deposition interacts with both above and below ground components of biodiversity to threaten the ability of bogs to act as N-sinks, which may offset the positive effects of N on C accumulation seen in other ecosystems.

AB Peatlands are common in many parts of the world. Draining and other changes in the use of peatlands increase atmospheric CO2 concentration. If we are to make reliable quantitative predictions of that effect, we need good information on the CO2 emission rates from peatlands. The present study uses two different methods for predicting CO2-C release of peatland soils: (i) a 40-year field investigation of balancing organic carbon stocks and (ii) short-term CO2-C release rates from laboratory experiments. To estimate long-term losses of peat, and its resulting C input to the atmosphere, we combined highly detailed maps of surface topography and its changes, and the organic C contents and bulk densities of a drained peatland from different years. Short-term CO2-C release rates were measured in the laboratory by incubating soil samples from several soil horizons at various temperatures and soil moistures. We then derived nonlinear CO2-C production functions, which we incorporated into a numerical simulation model (HYDRUS). Using HYDRUS, we calculated daily soil water components and CO2-release for (i) real-climate data from 1950 to 2003 and (ii) a climate scenario extending to 2050, including an increase in temperature of 2 degrees C and 20% less rainfall during the summer half year, i.e. from April to September inclusive. From our field measurements, we found a mean annual decrease of 0.7 cm in the thickness of the peat. Large losses (> 1.5 cm year(-1)) occurred only during periods when groundwater levels were low (i.e. a deep water-table). The annual CO2-C release results in a mean loss from the peat of about 700 g CO2-C m(-2), mostly as a direct contribution to the atmosphere. Both methods produced very similar results. The model scenarios demonstrated that CO2-C loss is mainly controlled by the groundwater (i.e. water-table) depth, which controls subsurface aeration. A local climate scenario estimated a c. 5% increase of CO2-C losses within the next 50 years.

AB P>1. Climate change in the subarctic is expected to influence vegetation composition, specifically bryophyte and lichen communities, thereby modifying litter decomposition rates and carbon (C) dynamics of these systems with possible feedbacks to climate.
   2. In a 2-year experiment, we investigated decomposition rates and chemical traits of 27 bryophytes, 17 lichens and 5 vascular plants in litter beds in subarctic Sweden. The majority of the sampled cryptogam species are widespread at higher northern latitudes.
   3. Average 2-year litter decomposition rates (exponential mass loss constant k) of lichen (0.44 +/- 0.01) and vascular plant (0.56 +/- 0.03) species were higher than that of bryophytes (0.11 +/- 0.01), while within main cryptogam taxa, species identity was an important determinant of mass loss rates. At cryptogam group level, 2-year litter mass loss of Sphagnum was significantly lower than for non-Sphagnum mosses and liverworts. Within lichens, N(2)-fixing versus non-N(2)-fixing lichens showed no variation in decomposability.
   4. In a subset of the large species set, mass loss differed both among incubation environments (reflecting nutrient-rich and poor birch forest and Sphagnum peatlands, respectively) and species. The pattern of mass loss across incubation environments was not consistent among cryptogam species. N(2)-fixing, in contrast to non-N(2)-fixing lichens with lower nitrogen (N) levels displayed similar decomposition rates across incubation environments. Mass loss of non-Sphagnum mosses was correlated with initial N irrespective of incubation environment.
   5. Litter mass loss of cryptogam taxa could be predicted very well from infrared spectra of the initial chemical composition of the species, by application of Fourier transform infrared using an attenuated total reflectance probe. The initial macronutrient concentrations (N, phosphorus, C and cations) and initial litter pH correlated less well.
   6. Synthesis. We showed comprehensively that decomposition rates of bryophytes are generally lower than those of lichens and vascular plants. Among bryophyte or lichen species there is also great variation in litter decomposability which depends strongly on species-specific chemistry. Our data will help predict changing land surface feedback to C cycles and climate in cold biomes by understanding long-term climate effects on litter decomposability through shifting vegetation composition.

AB Drained peatlands often act as carbon dioxide (CO2) hotspots. Raising the groundwater table is expected to reduce their CO2 contribution to the atmosphere and revitalise their function as carbon (C) sink in the long term. Without strict water management rewetting often results in partial flooding and the formation of spatially heterogeneous, nutrient-rich shallow lakes. Uncertainties remain as to when the intended effect of rewetting is achieved, as this specific ecosystem type has hardly been investigated in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange. In most cases of rewetting, methane (CH4) emissions increase under anoxic conditions due to a higher water table and in terms of global warming potential (GWP) outperform the shift towards CO2 uptake, at least in the short term.
   Based on eddy covariance measurements we studied the ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of CH4 and CO2 at a shallow lake situated on a former fen grassland in northeastern Germany. The lake evolved shortly after flooding, 9 years previous to our investigation period. The ecosystem consists of two main surface types: open water (inhabited by submerged and floating vegetation) and emergent vegetation (particularly including the eulittoral zone of the lake, dominated by Typha latifolia). To determine the individual contribution of the two main surface types to the net CO2 and CH4 exchange of the whole lake ecosystem, we combined footprint analysis with CH4 modelling and net ecosystem exchange partitioning.
   The CH4 and CO2 dynamics were strikingly different between open water and emergent vegetation. Net CH4 emissions from the open water area were around 4-fold higher than from emergent vegetation stands, accounting for 53 and 13aEuro-gaEuro-CH(4)aEuro-m(-2)aEuro-a(-1) respectively. In addition, both surface types were net CO2 sources with 158 and 750aEuro-gaEuro-CO(2)aEuro-m(-2)aEuro-a(-1) respectively. Unusual meteorological conditions in terms of a warm and dry summer and a mild winter might have facilitated high respiration rates. In sum, even after 9 years of rewetting the lake ecosystem exhibited a considerable C loss and global warming impact, the latter mainly driven by high CH4 emissions. We assume the eutrophic conditions in combination with permanent high inundation as major reasons for the unfavourable GHG balance.

AB Peatlands are globally important long-term sinks of carbon, however there is concern that enhanced peat decomposition and moss moisture stress due to climate change mediated drought will reduce moss productivity making these ecosystems vulnerable to carbon loss and associated long-term degradation. Peatlands are resilient to summer drought moss stress because of negative ecohydrological feedbacks that generally maintain a wet peat surface, but where feedbacks may be contingent on peat depth. We tested this 'survival of the deepest' hypothesis by examining water table (WT) position, near-surface moisture content, and soil water tension in peatlands that differ in size, peat depth, and catchment area during a summer drought. All shallow sites (<40 cm depth) lost their WT (i.e., the groundwater well was dry) for considerable time during the drought period. Near-surface soil water tension increased dramatically at shallow sites following WT loss, increasing similar to 5-7.5x greater at shallow sites compared to deep sites (>= 40 cm depth). During a mid-summer drought intensive field survey, we found that 60-67% of plots at shallow sites exceeded a 100 mb tension threshold used to infer moss water stress. Unlike the shallow sites, tension typically did not exceed this 100 mb threshold at the deep sites. Using species dependent water content - chlorophyll fluorescence thresholds and relations between volumetric water content and WT depth, Monte Carlo simulations suggest that moss had nearly twice the likelihood of being stressed at shallow sites (0.38 +/- 0.24) compared to deep sites (0.22 +/- 0.18). This study provides evidence that mosses in shallow peatland may be particularly vulnerable to warmer and drier climates in the future, but where species composition may play an important role. We argue that a critical 'threshold' peat depth specific for different hydrogeological and hydroclimatic regions can be used to assess what peatlands are especially vulnerable to climate change mediated drought.

AB We used a relatively simple two-layer, coupled hydrology-biogeochemistry model to simultaneously simulate streamflow and stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in a small lead and arsenic contaminated upland peat catchment in northwestern Germany. The model procedure was informed by an initial data mining analysis, in combination with regression relationships of discharge, DOC, and element export. We assessed the internal model DOC processing based on stream DOC hysteresis patterns and 3-hourly time step groundwater level and soil DOC data for two consecutive summer periods in 2013 and 2014. The parsimonious model (i.e., few calibrated parameters) showed the importance of nonlinear and rapid near-surface runoff generation mechanisms that caused around 60% of simulated DOC load. The total load was high even though these pathways were only activated during storm events on average 30% of the monitoring time-as also shown by the experimental data. Overall, the drier period 2013 resulted in increased nonlinearity but exported less DOC (115 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) +/- 11 kgCha(-1) yr(-1)) compared to the equivalent but wetter period in 2014 (189 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) +/- 38 kgCha(-1) yr-1). The exceedance of a critical water table threshold (-10 cm) triggered a rapid near-surface runoff response with associated higher DOC transport connecting all available DOC pools and subsequent dilution. We conclude that the combination of detailed experimental work with relatively simple, coupled hydrology-biogeochemistry models not only allowed the model to be internally constrained but also provided important insight into how DOC and tightly coupled pollutants or trace elements are mobilized.
   Plain Language Summary Peat soils act as important carbon sinks, but they also release large amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to the aquatic system. The DOC export is strongly tied to soluble heavy metals and other pollutants, which can pose a threat to human health. However, limited knowledge exists as to how much of these substances are mobilized, how they are mobilized in terms of flow pathways, and under which hydrometeorological conditions. In this regard, models can be useful and here we present a simple, conceptual model coupling the element export to hydrology. We could identify the nonlinear and rapid nature of the runoff generation mechanisms and their overwhelming influence on DOC (>60%) and element export in our small peat catchment. Furthermore, only, if all DOC pools were connected above a certain soil water level, such rapid near-surface flow paths developed. We concluded that simple models coupling the hydrology to biogeochemistry allowed to gain important insight into how DOC and tightly coupled heavy metals are mobilized in peat soil catchments.

AB The magnitude and geographical distribution of natural sources and sinks of atmospheric CH4 in the biosphere are still poorly known. Estimates of the net contribution from northern wetlands have been lowered during recent years. According to current consensus, about 35 Tg CH4/yr originates from northern wetlands and tundra. A process-oriented ecosystem source model for CH4 is used here to obtain an independent estimate for this flux. The model estimates steady-state seasonal cycles of NPP and heterotrophic respiration (HR). It accounts for peatland carbon storage and then obtains CH4 emission as a proportion of HR with the constant of proportionality (as a range) estimated from observations. The model was shown consistent with seasonal data (including winter) on NPP, soil respiration and CH4 emission at sites spanning a range of latitudes and climates. Applied on a 1 degrees grid basis using standard climatological and wetland distribution data sets, this approach yields a total non-forested wetland and tundra emission (>50 degrees N) of 8.7 +/- 5.8 Tg CH4/yr. After inclusion of forested wetlands, we estimate a total emission from northern wetlands and tundra of 20 +/- 13 Tg CH4/yr. This is somewhat lower than current atmospherically based estimates. The difference may be due to localized high emissions, which have been reported, e.g., for West Siberian wetlands but which are not well understood and not included in current models.

AB Partitioning soil respiration (SR) into its components, heterotrophic and rhizospheric respiration, is an important step for understanding and modelling carbon (C) cycling in organic soils. However, no partitioning studies on afforested organic soil croplands exist. We separated soil respiration originating from the decomposition of peat (SRP), and aboveground litter (SRL) and root respiration (SRR) in six afforested organic soil croplands in Finland with varying tree species and stand ages using the trenching method. Across the sites temporal variation in SR was primarily related to changes in soil surface temperature (-5 cm), which explained 71-96% of variation in SR rates. Decomposition of peat and litter was not related to changes in water table level, whereas a minor increase in root respiration was observed with the increase in water table depth. Temperature sensitivity of SR varied between the different respiration components: SRp was less sensitive to changes in soil surface temperature than SRL or SRR. Factors explaining spatial variation in SR differed between different respiration components. Annual SRp correlated positively with peat ash content while that of SRL was found to correlate positively with the amount of litter on the forest floor, separately for each tree species. Root respiration correlated positively with the biomass of ground vegetation. From the total soil respiration peat decomposition comprised a major share of 42%; the proportion of autotrophic respiration being 41% and aboveground litter 17%. Afforestation lowered peat decomposition rates. Nevertheless the effect of agricultural history can be seen in peat properties for decades and due to high peat decomposition rates these soils still loose carbon to the atmosphere.

AB Peatland restoration has been implemented on sites exploited for horticultural peat for over a decade in Eastern Canada. However, little is known about nutrient dynamics and microbial processes in this region. Belowground nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) transformations and carbon utilisation by microorganisms were examined in a harvested peatland 10 years after restoration measures were implemented to assess whether restoration is returning the peatland to a state that falls within the natural range of variation found in a neighbouring bog. N mineralisation rates were almost 10-fold higher in the surface (0-10 cm) compared to the subsurface (10-20 cm) layers for all sites and were highly variable within sites. P pools were small (<0.02 mu g g(-1) dry peat) and mineralisation rates of P were low in all sections. In the surface layer, the net mineralisation and ammonification rates appeared to be highest in unrestored sites but lowest in restored sites. In contrast, the capacity of microorganisms in using different carbon (C) sources, also described as microbial functional diversity, was highest at restored sites but lowest at unrestored sites. The preferable C sources varied between sites and were significantly correlated with aboveground vegetation composition. Our study suggests that microbial activity and nutrient transformations differ between natural and unrestored harvested peatlands. Our results indicate that the presence of vegetation regrowth in the unrestored area of a peatland alters belowground processes by stimulating microbial activity and increasing the uptake of nutrients, leading to smaller pools of inorganic N available in the peat. When restoration has been carried out, microbial activity is even higher than in natural conditions, possibly leading to high immobilization of N, and net mineralisation rates are very low. This research indicates that while belowground processes have shifted from unrestored conditions following restoration, they do not appear to be fully re-established to a degree similar to natural conditions 10 years post-restoration.

AB Precipitation patterns are becoming increasingly extreme, particularly at northern latitudes. Current climate models predict that this trend will continue in the future. While droughts have been repeatedly studied in many ecosystems over the last decades, the consequences of increasingly intense, but less frequent rainfall events, on carbon (C) cycling are not well understood. At northern latitudes, peatlands store one third of the terrestrial carbon and their functioning is highly dependent on water. Shifts in rainfall regimes could disrupt peatland C dynamics and speed-up the rates of C loss. How will these immense stocks of C be able to withstand and recover from extreme rainfall? We tested the resistance and resilience effects of extreme precipitation regimes on peatland carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes, pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and litter decomposition rates by exposing intact peat cores to extreme, spring-time rainfall patterns in a controlled mesocosm experiment. We find that more intense but less frequent rainfall destabilized water table dynamics, with cascading effects on peatland C fluxes. Decomposition and respiration rates increased with a deeper mean water table depth (WTD) and larger WTD fluctuations. We observed similar patterns for CO2 uptake, which were likely mediated by improved vascular plant performance. After a three-week recovery period, CO2 fluxes still displayed responses to the earlier WTD dynamics, suggesting lagged effects of precipitation regime shifts. Furthermore, we found that CH4 emissions decreased with deeper mean WTD, but this showed a high resilience once WTD dynamics stabilised. Not only do our results illustrate that shifting rainfall patterns translate in altered WTD dynamics and, consequentially, influence C fluxes, they also demonstrate that exposure to altered rainfall early in the growing season can have lasting effects on CO2 exchange. Even though the increased CO2 assimilation under extreme precipitation patterns signals peatland resistance under changing climatic conditions, it may instead mark the onset of vascular plant encroachment and the associated C loss.

AB Stable isotope measures in organic matter are frequently used as indicators of past climate change. Although such analyses can provide valuable information, there is considerable uncertainty associated with studies of organic-rich sediments, especially those from Arctic lakes and bogs. We studied stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, and magnetic properties in a sediment core from a small alkaline lake with a high sedimentation rate, Lake Nattmalsvatn, Norway. There is good correspondence among the different sediment variables during the late glacial, and they seemingly reflect major climate variations such as the Allerod Interstade and the Younger Dryas, as well as the transition into the current interglacial. During the early Holocene, however, these relationships are more complex and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values do not stabilize until similar to 7,500 cal year BP. A significant excursion in all variables occurs between 6,850 and 6,500 cal year BP and is interpreted to represent climate deterioration. Holocene delta C-13 values vary little and indicate that isotopically-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the lake, possibly influenced by methanotrophy and high pCO(2), dominated the lake's carbon cycle. Holocene delta N-15 is similarly muted, likely due to the availability of abundant dissolved nitrogen. Bulk organic matter is probably dominated by phytoplankton remains produced beneath the ice cover in late spring and during ice breakup when isotopically-depleted DIC, pCO(2) and ammonium availability were maximal. Thus, use of delta C-13 and delta N-15 as indicators of Holocene paleoclimate and paleoproductivity variation can be challenging in a lake such as Nattmalsvatn, where ice cover isolates the basin for large parts of the year, allowing dissolved respiratory gases to accumulate in the water column. In contrast, magnetic variables appear to better track climate variations. In particular, runoff-driven influx of minerogenic sediments shows high variability that can be attributed to regional changes in Holocene winter precipitation. The most striking shifts occur between 4,000 and 2,300 cal year BP.

AB Wetlands (called bofedales in the Andes of Peru) are abundant and important components of many mountain ecosystems across the globe. They provide many benefits including water storage, high quality habitat, pasture, nutrient sinks and transformations, and carbon storage. The remote and rugged setting of mountain wetlands creates challenges for mapping, typically leading to misclassification and underestimates of wetland extent. We used multi-date, multi-sensor radar and optical imagery (Landsat TM/PALSAR/RADARSAT-1/SRTM DEM-TPI) combined with ground truthing for mapping wetlands in Huascaran National Park, Peru. We mapped bofedales into major wetland types: 1) cushion plant peatlands, 2) cushion plant wet meadows, and 3) graminoid wet meadows with an overall accuracy of 92%. A fourth wetland type was found (graminoid peatlands) but was too rare to map accurately, thus it was combined with cushion peatland to form a single peatland class. Total wetland area mapped in the National Park is 38,444 ha, which is 11% of the park area. Peatlands were the most abundant wetland type occupying 6.3% of the park, followed by graminoid wet meadows (3.5%) and cushion wet meadows (1.3%). These maps will serve as the foundation for improved management, including restoration, and estimates of landscape carbon stocks.

AB Boreal peatlands contain a large portion of the Earth's terrestrial organic carbon and may be particularly vulnerable to changes in climate. Temperatures in boreal regions are predicted to increase during the twenty-first century which may accelerate changes in soil microbial processes and plant community dynamics. In particular, climate-driven changes in plant community composition might affect the pathways and rates of methanogenesis, the plant-mediated emission of methane, and the scavenging of methane by methanotrophic bacteria. Climate change may also affect methane cycling through changes in pore water chemistry. To date, these feedbacks have not been incorporated into the carbon cycling components of climate models. We investigated the effects of soil warming and water table manipulations on methane cycling in a field mesocosm experiment in northern Minnesota, USA. Large intact soil monoliths removed from a bog and fen received infrared warming treatments crossed with water table treatments for 6 years. In years 5 and 6, concentrations, fluxes, and isotopic compositions of methane were measured along with aboveground and belowground net primary productivity and pore water concentrations of acetate, sulfate, ammonium, nitrate, and dissolved organic carbon. Water table level was the dominant control over methane flux in the fen mesocosms, likely through its effect on methane oxidation rates. However, pore water chemistry and plant productivity were important secondary factors in explaining methane flux in the fen mesocosms, and these factors appeared to be the predominant controls over methane flux in the bog mesocosms. The water table and IR treatments had large effects on pore water chemistry and plant productivity, so the indirect effects of climate change appear to be just as important as the direct effects of changing temperature and water table level in controlling future methane fluxes from northern peatlands. Pore water sulfate, ammonium, nitrate, and acetate had a relatively consistent negative relationship with methane emissions, pore water DOC had a positive relationship with methane emissions, and BNPP had mixed effects. The bog mesocosms had much higher methane emissions and pore water methane concentrations than the fen mesocosms, despite a much lower average water table level and peat that is a poor substrate for methanogenesis. We suggest that the relatively high methane fluxes in the bog mesocosms can be explained through their low concentrations of inhibitory pore water compounds, high concentrations of DOC, and high plant productivity. Stable isotopic data from pore water support acetate fermentation as the principal pathway of methanogenesis in bog mesocosms (mean delta(13) CH4 = -41.0%, mean delta D-CH4 = -190%). Fen mesocosms had lower pore water concentrations and emissions of methane than bog mesocosms, despite much higher methane production potentials in fen peat. The methane from the fen mesocosms was isotopically heavy (mean delta(CH4)-C-13 = -28.9%, mean delta D-CH4 = -140%), suggesting a strong oxidative sink. This is likely related to the dominance of graminoid vegetation and the associated oxygen transport into the rhizosphere. Our results illustrate the need for a more robust understanding of the multiple feedbacks between climate forcing and plant and microbial feedbacks in the response of northern peatlands to climate change.

AB The sources and diagenesis of organic matter in a sediment core from the Swinnplate backbarrier area near Spiekeroog Island in the northwest German Wadden Sea have been examined using stable carbon isotopes, C-14-ages and lipid biomarker data. Twenty-two core sections were analysed from the surface to a depth of 90 cm, representing sedimentation over the past approximately 200 years. Total organic carbon (TOC) contents were highly variable (0.1-1%), as was the grain size with some core sections containing up to 50% of clay and silt (mud fraction). These data indicate a highly variable depositional regime in which organic matter is extensively degraded both before and after incorporation into the sediments. The TOC content was strongly correlated with the abundance of the mud fraction, indicating the importance of organic matter sorption onto particles for preservation of both marine and terrestrial organic matter. Sediments near the top of the core were enriched in marine organic matter, but terrestrial organic matter predominated in most core sections. Some samples showed higher TOC contents than might be predicted from the TOC-grain size relationship. Isotope and biomarker studies showed that these contained additional terrestrial organic matter from peats, possibly eroded from areas to the west of the investigated area. The organic matter in these layers had the lightest values of delta(13)C (about -26 parts per thousand compared with a more typical mixed marine-terrestrial value of -24 parts per thousand). Most of the Iz-alkane distributions show a strong predominance of odd-carbon-number alkanes typical of the distributions found in higher plant waxes. All core sections contained abundant long-chain alcohols and triterpenoid alcohols such as alpha-amyrin, beta-amyrin, lupeol, taraxerol, taraxerone and friedelin from higher plants. The dihydroxy triterpenoid betulin was particularly abundant confirming that eroded peats are a major source of the lipids. Further confirmation was obtained from AMS-determined C-14-ages of fatty acid and neutral lipid fractions from 46.5 to 60 cm deep core sections which were 5570 and 6240 yr BP, respectively. These data attest to the importance of recycled older organic material (eroded peat) in the carbon cycle of this coastal environment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tropical wetlands are important in the global carbon (C) cycle and climate system. To elaborate government policies that protect wetland ecosystem services, spatially explicit data on the existing C stocks are needed. This study quantified above and below ground C stocks in mangrove, swamp forests, marshes, and grazed wetlands in three different regions in Mexico (Veracruz, Tabasco/Campeche, and Chiapas states), using a combination of remote sensing techniques and field data collection. We report a 0.688 Gt C stock in the areas investigated showing that these wetlands hold important C stocks. The total C stock of Mexico's wetlands is expected to be considerably larger as our study is not a complete survey of Mexico's total wetland area. Across the three regions, the currently unprotected swamp forests and marshes had substantial peat deposits storing approximate to 0.232 and 0.375 Pg C, respectively. The high C stocks found in swamp forests (1801 +/- 283 Mg C ha(-1)) and marshes (1100 +/- 376 Mg C ha(-1)) are likely to be vulnerable to human interventions such as drainage. Flooded grasslands, used for grazing, had substantially lower C storage (271 +/- 122 Mg C ha(-1)), showing that grazed areas are less effective as C stores. Across sites the belowground C pool that was two orders of magnitude greater than the aboveground biomass C stocks. Carbon storage in wetland vegetation types differed among the three study regions, indicating the need for developing government policies considering a specific regional approach to protect the C stocks of coastal wetlands. Given that freshwater swamps had the greatest C stocks and freshwater marshes stored most C, these wetland peat deposits should be prioritized for conservation, via new legislation or inclusion in payment for ecosystem services schemes.

AB Drainage and cultivation have turned peatlands from carbon (C) sinks into hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Raising the water table and planting of winter cover crops are potential strategies to help reduce peat oxidation and re-initiate net C accumulation during the non-cropping period. However, the effects of these practices as well as their interactions on GHG emissions remain unclear. Here, we carried out an outdoor mesocosm experiment to elucidate the effect of water table levels (-30 cm and -50 cm) and winter cover crop cultivation (vetch, rye, no plant) on carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes during the winter period (November-April). Soil-atmosphere GHG exchange, GHG concentrations within the peat profile and soil water solute concentrations were monitored. Our results showed that high water table significantly reduced ecosystem respiration, while it had no net effect on N2O and CH4 fluxes. Uptake of available N by the cover crop significantly reduced nitrate in soil solution, thereby lowering the potential for leaching and both direct and indirect N2O emissions. No interactive effects between water table levels and cover crops were detected for any of the measured GHG fluxes. Seasonal variations of GHG fluxes were positively correlated with soil air concentrations at -15 cm and -40 cm depths, which were further regulated by dissolved organic C, nitrate concentration, and anaerobic conditions in the soil. This study suggests that there is great potential to raise water table levels and introduce green cover crops to reduce GHG emissions. Further studies are needed to achieve a complete evaluation of these strategies outside of the growing season, which may provide a significant mitigation benefit in C-rich cultivated peatlands.

AB Boreal bogs are important stores and sinks of atmospheric carbon whose surfaces are characterised by vegetation microforms. Efficient methods for monitoring their vegetation are needed because changes in vegetation composition lead to alteration in their function such as carbon gas exchange with the atmosphere. We investigated how airborne image and waveform-recording LiDAR data can be used for 3D mapping of microforms in an open bog which is a mosaic of pools, hummocks with a few stunted pines, hollows, intermediate surfaces and mud-bottom hollows. The proposed method operates on the bog surface, which is reconstructed using LiDAR. The vegetation was classified at 20 cm resolution. We hypothesised that LiDAR data describe surface topography, moisture and the presence and depth of field-layer vegetation and surface roughness; while multiple images capture the colours and texture of the vegetation, which are influenced by directional reflectance effects. We conclude that geometric LiDAR features are efficient predictors of microforms. LiDAR intensity and echo width were specific to moisture and surface roughness, respectively. Directional reflectance constituted 4-34 % of the variance in images and its form was linked to the presence of the field layer. Microform-specific directional reflectance patterns were deemed to be of marginal value in enhancing the classification, and RGB image features were inferior to LiDAR variables. Sensor fusion is an attractive option for fine-scale mapping of these habitats. We discuss the task and propose options for improving the methodology.

AB A strain of Mycobacterium austroafricanum capable of mineralizing methyl tert-butyl ether (MtBE) as its sole carbon and energy source had previously been isolated from activated sludge. The use of this bacteria in a biobarrier system for the in situ treatment of contaminated groundwater was the ultimate goal of this work. This paper reports the results of initial studies to find an appropriate immobilizing or support material. Several materials (peat, perlite, pozzolan, pumice and granulated activated carbon) were considered. Selection was based on the measurement and comparison of their abilities to immobilize or retain the bacteria, and to adsorb MtBE.
   The immobilization test was based on monitoring the respiration of bacteria remaining on the material after initial contact times of either 24 or 72 h. O-2 consumption and CO2 production were measured over a period of time. The study showed that perlite was the best material.
   Adsorption isotherms for MtBE were constructed for each support. The strength of adsorption coefficient, K-f, in the Freundlich equation was calculated and used as the basis for comparison of their adsorptive capacities. The strength of adsorption was highest for the granulated activated carbon, and the K-f values for the other materials were relatively low and fell within the same range. However, since GAC performed poorly in the immobilization test, perlite was selected as the best support material. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In ombrotrophic peatlands, the moisture content of the acrotelm (vadoze zone) controls oxygen diffusion rates, redox state, and the turnover of organic matter. Thus, variably saturated flow processes determine whether peatlands act as sinks or sources of atmospheric carbon, and modelling these processes is crucial to assess effects of changed environmental conditions on the future development of these ecosystems. We show that the Richards equation can be used to accurately describe the moisture dynamics under evaporative conditions in variably saturated peat soil, encompassing the transition from the topmost living moss layer to the decomposed peat as part of the vadose zone. Soil hydraulic properties (SHP) were identified by inverse simulation of evaporation experiments on samples from the entire acrotelm. To obtain consistent descriptions of the observations, the traditional van GenuchtenMualem model was extended to account for non-capillary water storage and flow. We found that the SHP of the uppermost moss layer reflect a pore-size distribution (PSD) that combines three distinct pore systems of the Sphagnum moss. For deeper samples, acrotelm pedogenesis changes the shape of the SHP due to the collapse of inter-plant pores and an infill with smaller particles. This leads to gradually more homogeneous and bi-modal PSDs with increasing depth, which in turn can serve as a proxy for increasing state of pedogenesis in peatlands. From this, we derive a nomenclature and size classification for the pore spaces of Sphagnum mosses and define inter-, intra-, and inner-plant pore spaces, with effective pore diameters of > 300, 300-30, and 30-10 mu m, respectively.

AB Monitoring tools are needed to assess changes in peatland biotic communities and ecosystem functions in response to on-going climate and other environmental changes. Although the responses of soil organisms and plants to ecological gradients and perturbations do not always correlate, peatland monitoring is mainly based on vegetation surveys. Testate amoebae, a group of protists, are important contributors to carbon and nitrogen cycling in organic soils and are useful bioindicators in peatland ecology and paleoecology. There is however little comparative data on the value of testate amoebae, vascular plants and bryophytes as bioindicators of micro-environmental gradients in peatlands.
   We compared the relationships of testate amoebae, bryophytes, and vascular plants with soil temperature, water table depth, micro-habitats and the carbon and nitrogen content of Sphagnum mosses in four peatlands along a 1300 m altitudinal gradient in Switzerland. We used the full diversity of vascular plants and bryophyte but only a selection of ten easily identifiable testate amoeba morpho-taxa (i.e. species or species-complexes).
   Indirect and direct gradient ordinations, multiple factor analysis (MFA) and transfer function models for inferring water table depth showed that a selection of ten testate amoeba taxa are more powerful (% variance explained in RDA) and accurate (discrimination among habitats) indicators of local conditions (micro-habitat type, water table depth and Sphagnum C/N ratio) than the vegetation (vascular plants and bryophytes either individually or combined and considering the full diversity).
   Our study showed that a limited list of ten easily identifiable testate amoeba taxa have higher bioindication value than the full bryophytes and vascular plants. Furthermore, testate amoebae can be analyzed on samples collected at any season (accessibility allowing and if precise sampling sites are well marked) - a clear advantage for biomonitoring and can be used to infer past changes from the peat record at the same taxonomic resolution. This simple approach could therefore be very useful for biomonitoring of peatlands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Drivers of Holocene peatland carbon accumulation across a climate

AB Peatlands are an important component of the Holocene global carbon (C) cycle and the rate of C sequestration and storage is driven by the balance between net primary productivity and decay. A number of studies now suggest that climate is a key driver of peatland C accumulation at large spatial scales and over long timescales, with warmer conditions associated with higher rates of C accumulation. However, other factors are also likely to play a significant role in determining local carbon accumulation rates and these may modify past, present and future peatland carbon sequestration. Here, we test the importance of climate as a driver of C accumulation, compared with hydrological change, fire, nitrogen content and vegetation type, from records of C accumulation at three sites in northeastern North America, across the N-S climate gradient of raised bog distribution. Radiocarbon age models, bulk density values and %C measurements from each site are used to construct C accumulation histories commencing between 11,200 and 8000 cal. years BP. The relationship between C accumulation and environmental variables (past water table depth, fire, peat forming vegetation and nitrogen content) is assessed with linear and multivariate regression analyses. Differences in long-term rates of carbon accumulation between sites support the contention that a warmer climate with longer growing seasons results in faster rates of long-term carbon accumulation. However, mid-late Holocene accumulation rates show divergent trends, decreasing in the north but rising in the south. We hypothesise that sites close to the moisture threshold for raised bog distribution increased their growth rate in response to a cooler climate with lower evapotranspiration in the late Holocene, but net primary productivity declined over the same period in northern areas causing a decrease in C accumulation. There was no clear relationship between C accumulation and hydrological change, vegetation, nitrogen content or fire, but early successional stages of peatland growth had faster rates of C accumulation even though temperatures were probably lower at the time. We conclude that climate is the most important driver of peatland accumulation rates over millennial timescales, but that successional vegetation change is a significant additional influence. Whilst the majority of northern peatlands are likely to increase C accumulation rates under future warmer climates, those at the southern limit of distribution may show reduced rates. However, early succession peatlands that develop under future warming at the northern limits of peatland distribution are likely to have high rates of C accumulation and will compensate for some of the losses elsewhere.

AB Drained peatland forests form an important timber resource in Finland. They also form a sink for atmospheric carbon (C) because of the increased growth and C sequestration rates following drainage. These rates have, however, been poorly quantified. We simulated the tree stand dynamics for drained peatland stands with and without cuttings over two stand rotations. Simulations were done on four peatland site types and two regions in Finland with different climatic conditions, using recently published peatland tree growth models applied in a stand simulator. We then calculated the amount of C stored in the stands on the basis of previously published tree-level biomass and C content models. Finally, we developed regression models to estimate C stores in the tree stands using stand stem volume as the predictor variable. In the managed stands, the mean growth (annual volume increment) ranged from 2 to 9 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1), depending on the rotation (first/second), site type and region. Total yield during one rotation varied from 250 to 970 m(3) ha(-1). The maximum stand volumes varied from 220 to 520 m(3) ha(-1) in the managed stands and from 360 to 770 m(3) ha(-1) in the unmanaged. By the end of the first post-drainage rotation the total C store in the managed stands had increased by 6-12 kg C m(-2) (i.e. 45-140 g C m(-2) a(-1)) compared to that in the undrained situation. Averaged over two rotations, the increase in the total C store was 3-6 kg C m(-2). in the corresponding unmanaged stands the C stores increased by 8-15 kg m(-2) over the same periods. At stand level, the C stores were almost linearly related to the stern volume and the developed regression equations could explain the variation in the simulated C stores almost entirely.

AB PurposeWetlands have a critical impact on the global carbon cycle. This study aims to investigate the spatial and vertical distribution of the soil organic carbon concentration (SOCc), to identify the differences of SOCc among swamps, marshes, bogs, and fens at a regional scale, and finally to examine the main environmental factors impacting SOCc at different depth intervals within different wetland types located in the Greater Khingan Mountains (GKM).Materials and methodsA total of 218 soil samples were collected. SOCc was determined by the combustion-oxidation method. To analyze the impacts of wetland type, soil type, mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT), evapotranspiration (ET), elevation (EL), and slope (SL) on SOCc, statistical analysis methods were executed, including ANOVA with the Duncan test, Pearson correlations analysis, and the stepwise multiple regressions analysis.Results and discussionThe mean values of SOCc in the 0-30, 30-60, and 60-100-cm intervals were 130.4, 64.2, and 32.6gkg(-1), respectively. The wetland type played an important role in the pattern of SOCc in terms of significant differences (p<0.05) among the different wetland types in the 0-60-cm depth. However, significant differences were not found among different soil types. In terms of the wetland type, the highest SOCc was found in bogs (p<0.05), probably due to the higher MAP and lower MAT. The increased MAP (R-2=0.1369, p<0.01) and decreased MAT (R-2=0.1225, p<0.01) had positive associations on the wetland SOCc. ET (R-2=0.2809, p<0.01), MAP (R-2=0.2025, p<0.01), and EL (R-2=0.0484, p<0.05) were positively correlated with marsh SOCc. Moreover, MAP was positively correlated with the bog SOCc (R-2=0.1296, p<0.01). For vertical patterns, SOCc was higher in the 0-30-cm interval and decreased with depth. The impacts of environmental factors on SOCc decreased with depth for each wetland type. Models were developed to document the relations between the SOCc of marshes and fens and corresponding environmental factors.ConclusionsWetland types largely differed in the soil carbon pools in the GKM of China. The relative importance of environmental factors was different for the SOCc values of various wetland types. To minimize carbon loss into the atmosphere, more protections are required for wetlands, especially in the 0-30-cm depth interval because it contains higher SOCc values and is more vulnerable and less stable than those in the deeper layers.

AB The Kolyma River in northeast Siberia is among the six largest Arctic rivers and drains a region underlain by vast deposits of Holocene-aged peat and Pleistocene-aged loess known as yedoma, most of which is currently stored in ice-rich permafrost throughout the region. These peat and yedoma deposits are important sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to inland waters that in turn play a significant role in the transport and ultimate remineralization of organic carbon to CO2 and CH4 along the terrestrial flow-path continuum. The turnover and fate of terrigenous DOM during offshore transport largely depends upon the composition and amount of carbon released to inland and coastal waters. Here, we measured the ultraviolet-visible optical properties of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) from a geographically extensive collection of waters spanning soil pore waters, streams, rivers, and the Kolyma River mainstem throughout a similar to 250 km transect of the northern Kolyma River basin. During the period of study, CDOM absorption coefficients were found to be robust proxies for the concentration of DOM, whereas additional CDOM parameters such as spectral slopes (S) were found to be useful indicators of DOM quality along the flow path. In particular, the spectral slope ratio (S-R) of CDOM demonstrated statistically significant differences between all four water types and tracked changes in the concentration of bioavailable DOC, suggesting that this parameter may be suitable for clearly discriminating shifts in organic matter characteristics among water types along the full flow-path continuum across this landscape. However, despite our observations of downstream shifts in DOM composition, we found a relatively constant proportion of DOC that was bioavailable (similar to 3-6% of total DOC) regardless of relative water residence time along the flow path. This may be a consequence of two potential scenarios allowing for continual processing of organic material within the system, namely (a) aquatic microorganisms are acclimating to a downstream shift in DOM composition and/or (b) photodegradation is continually generating labile DOM for continued microbial processing of DOM along the flow-path continuum. Without such processes, we would otherwise expect to see a declining fraction of bioavailable DOC downstream with increasing residence time of water in the system. With ongoing and future permafrost degradation, peat and yedoma deposits throughout the northeast Siberian region will become more hydrologically active, providing greater amounts of DOM to fluvial networks and ultimately to the Arctic Ocean. The ability to rapidly and comprehensively monitor shifts in the quantity and quality of DOM across the landscape is therefore critical for understanding potential future feedbacks within the Arctic carbon cycle.

AB We investigated the effect of increased N-supply on productivity and potential litter decay rates of Carex species, which are the dominant vascular plant species in peatlands in the Netherlands. We hypothesized that: (1) under conditions of N-limited plant growth, increased N-supply will lead to increased productivity but will not affect C:N ratios of plant litter and potential decay rates of that litter; and (2) under conditions of P-limited plant growth, increased N-supply will not affect productivity but it will lead to lower C:N ratios in plant litter and thereby to a higher potential decay rate of that litter. These hypotheses were tested by fertilization experiments (addition of 10 g N m(-2) year(-1)) in peatlands in which plant growth was N-limited and P-limited, respectively. We investigated the effects of fertilization on net C-fixation by plant biomass, N uptake, leaf litter chemistry and potential leaf litter decay. In a P-limited peatland, dominated by Carex lasiocarpa, there was no significant increase of net C-fixation by plant biomass upon enhanced N-supply, although N-uptake had increased significantly compared with the unfertilized control. Due to the N-fertilization the C:N ratio in the plant biomass decreased significantly. Similarly, the C:N ratio of leaf litter produced at the end of the experiment showed a significant decrease upon enhanced N-supply. The potential decay rate of that litter, measured as CO2-evolution from the litter under aerobic conditions, was significantly increased upon enhanced N-supply. In a N-limited peatland, dominated by C. acutiformis, the net C-fixation by plant biomass increased with increasing N-supply, whereas the increase in N-uptake was not significant. The C:N ratio of both living plant material and of dead leaves did not change in response to N-fertilization. The potential decay rate of the leaf litter was not affected by N-supply. The results agree with our hypotheses. This implies that atmospheric N-deposition may affect the CO2-sink function of peatlands, but the effect is dependent on the nature of nutrient limitation. In peatlands where plant growth is N-limited, increased N-supply leads to an increase in the net accumulation of C. Under conditions of P-limited plant growth, however, the net C-accumulation will decrease, because productivity is not further increased, whereas the amount of C lost through decomposition of dead organic matter is increased. As plant growth in most terrestrial ecosystems is N-limited, increased N-supply will in most peatlands lead to an increase of net C-accumulation.

AB Mountain fens are limited in their spatial extent but are vital ecosystems for biodiversity, habitat, and carbon and water cycling. Studies of fen hydrological function in northern regions indicate the timing and magnitude of runoff is variable, with atmospheric and environmental conditions playing key roles in runoff production. How the complex ecohydrological processes of mountain fens that govern water storage and release as well as peat accumulation will respond to a warmer and less snowy future climate is unclear. To provide insight, we studied the hydrological processes and function of Sibbald fen, located at the low end of the known elevation range in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, over a dry period. We added an evapotranspiration function to the Spence hydrological function method to better account for storage loss. When frozen in spring and early summer, the fen primarily transmits water. When thawed, the fen's hydrological function switches from water transmission to water release, leading to a summertime water table decline of nearly 1 m. Rainfall events larger than 5 mm can transiently switch fen hydrological function to storage, followed by contribution, depending on antecedent conditions. The evapotranspiration function was dominant only for a brief period in late June and early July when rainfall was low and the ground was still partially frozen, even though evapotranspiration accounted for the largest loss of storage from the system. This research highlights the mechanisms by which mountain peatlands supply baseflow during drought conditions, and the importance of frozen ground and rainfall in regulating their hydrological function. The study has important implications for the sustainability of low elevation mountain fens under climate change.

TI Litter type affects the activity of aerobic decomposers in a boreal

AB Peatlands are carbon (C) storage ecosystems sustained by a high water table (WT). High WT creates anoxic conditions that suppress the activity of aerobic decomposers and provide conditions for peat accumulation. Peatland function can be dramatically affected by WT drawdown caused by climate and/or land-use change. Aerobic decomposers are directly affected by WT drawdown through environmental factors such as increased oxygenation and nutrient availability. Additionally, they are indirectly affected via changes in plant community composition and litter quality. We studied the relative importance of direct and indirect effects of WT drawdown on aerobic decomposer activity in plant litter at two stages of decomposition (incubated in the field for 1 or 2 years). We did this by profiling 11 extracellular enzymes involved in the mineralization of organic C, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulphur. Our study sites represented a three-stage chronosequence from pristine to short-term (years) and long-term (decades) WT drawdown conditions under two nutrient regimes (bog and fen). The litter types included reflected the prevalent vegetation: Sphagnum mosses, graminoids, shrubs and trees.
   Litter type was the main factor shaping microbial activity patterns and explained about 30% of the variation in enzyme activities and activity allocation. Overall, enzyme activities were higher in vascular plant litters compared to Sphagnum litters, and the allocation of enzyme activities towards C or nutrient acquisition was related to the initial litter quality (chemical composition). Direct effects of WT regime, site nutrient regime and litter decomposition stage (length of incubation period) summed to only about 40% of the litter type effect. WT regime alone explained about 5% of the variation in enzyme activities and activity allocation. Generally, enzyme activity increased following the long-term WT drawdown and the activity allocation turned from P and N acquisition towards C acquisition. This caused an increase in the rate of litter decomposition. The effects of the short-term WT drawdown were minor compared to those of the long-term WT drawdown: e. g., the increase in the activity of C-acquiring enzymes was up to 120% (bog) or 320% (fen) higher after the long-term WT drawdown compared to the short-term WT drawdown. In general, the patterns of microbial activity as well as their responses to WT drawdown depended on peatland type: e. g., the shift in activity allocation to C-acquisition was up to 100% stronger at the fen compared to the bog.
   Our results imply that changes in plant community composition in response to persistent WT drawdown will strongly affect the C dynamics of peatlands. The predictions of decomposer activity under changing climate and/or land-use thus cannot be based on the direct effects of the changed environment only, but need to consider the indirect effects of environmental changes: the changes in plant community composition, their dependence on peatland type, and their time scale.

AB Black carbon (BC) refers to solid charred residues produced by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. The Great Hinggan Mountains are located on the margin of the East Asian monsoon region, and BC from fossil fuel sources could be deposited in this region through transport by westerlies and the monsoon. The overall objective of this study was to evaluate the sources and intensity of BC deposited during the last 150 years in the Great Hinggan Mountains, Northeast China.
   BC concentrations, stable carbon isotope values of BC (delta C-13-BC), and charcoal counts in the Motianling (MP2) peatland were measured in this study. BC values measured via the chemical method were regarded as total BC concentrations, and the BC values measured via the microscope method (i.e., charcoal) represent BC from biomass burning.
   The results showed that BC in MP2 peatland was mainly produced from local fire events before the 1930s. After the 1930s, with the increase in European fossil fuel BC emissions, the BC produced by fossil fuels became the major BC sources in the MP2 peatland, and the total BC fluxes in the MP2 peatland were much higher than those before the 1930s. With the decrease in European BC emissions and increase in Chinese BC emissions after the 1970s, the BC emitted by China became the major fossil fuel BC source in the MP2 peatland. However, the implementation of environmentally friendly policies decreased the BC emissions from fire events, leading to the gradual decrease in BC depositional fluxes in recent years.
   In recent years, fossil fuels remain the major sources of BC, but the implementation of environmentally friendly policies has decreased fossil fuel BC emissions, leading to the gradual decrease in BC depositional fluxes in the Great Hinggan Mountains.

AB Sphagnum mosses are keystone species in northern peatlands. Notably, they play an important role in peatland carbon (C) cycling by regulating the composition and activity of microbial communities. However, it remains unclear whether information on Sphagnum phylogeny and/or traits-based composition (i.e. anatomical and morphological traits and metabolites) can be used to predict the structure of microbial communities and their functioning. Here we evaluated whether Sphagnum phylogeny and traits predict additional variation in peatland microbial community composition and functioning beyond what would be predicted from environmental characteristics (i.e. climatic and edaphic conditions). We collected Sphagnum and microbial data from five European peatlands distributed along a latitudinal gradient from northern Sweden to southern France. These data allowed us to assess Sphagnum anatomical and morphological traits and metabolites at different sites along changing environmental conditions. Using structural equation modelling (SEM) and phylogenetic distance analyses, we investigated the role of Sphagnum traits in shaping microbial community composition and functioning along with environmental conditions. We show that microbial community composition and traits varied independently from both Sphagnum phylogeny and the latitudinal gradient. Specifically, the addition of Sphagnum traits to climatic and edaphic variables to the SEM allowed it to explain a larger proportion of the explained variance (R-2). This observation was most apparent for the biomass of decomposers (+42%) and phototrophs (+19%), as well as for growth yield microbial traits (+10%). As such, that Sphagnum metabolites were important drivers for microbial community structure and traits, while Sphagnum anatomical and morphological traits were poor predictors. Synthesis. Our results highlight that Sphagnum metabolites are more likely to influence peatland microbial food web structure and functioning than Sphagnum anatomical and morphological traits. We provide further evidence that measurements of the plant metabolome, when combined with classical functional traits, improve our understanding of how the plants interact with their associated microbiomes.

AB Arctic and boreal peatlands play a major role in the global carbon (C) cycle. They are particularly efficient at sequestering carbon because their high water content limits decomposition rates to levels below their net primary productivity. Their future in a climate-change context is quite uncertain in terms of carbon emissions and carbon sequestration.
   Nuuk fen is a well-instrumented Greenlandic fen with monitoring of soil physical variables and greenhouse gas fluxes (CH4 and CO2) and is of particular interest for testing and validating land-surface models. But knowledge of soil carbon stocks and profiles is missing. This is a crucial shortcoming for a complete evaluation of models, as soil carbon is one of the primary drivers of CH4 and CO2 soil emissions. To address this issue, we measured, for the first time, soil carbon and nitrogen density, profiles and stocks in the Nuuk peatland (64 degrees 07'51 '' N, 51 degrees 23'10 '' W), colocated with the greenhouse gas measurements. Measurements were made along two transects, 60 and 90 m long and with a horizontal resolution of 5m and a vertical resolution of 5 to 10 cm, using a 4 cm diameter gouge auger. A total of 135 soil samples were analyzed. Soil carbon density varied between 6.2 and 160.2 kg C m(-3) with a mean value of 50.2 kg C m(-3). Mean soil nitrogen density was 2.37 kg N m(-3). Mean soil carbon and nitrogen stocks are 36.3 kg C m(-2) and 1.7 kg N m(-2). These new data are in the range of those encountered in other arctic peatlands. This new dataset, one of very few in Greenland, can contribute to further development of joint modeling of greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon and nitrogen in land-surface models. The dataset is open-access and available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.909899 (Morel et al., 2019b).

AB The concentration" of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has dramatically increased from the start of the industrial revolution in the mid-1700s to present levels exceeding 400 ppm. Carbon dioxide derived from fossil fuel combustion is a greenhouse gas and a major contributor to on-going climate change. Carbon and oxygen stable isotope geochemistry is a useful tool to help model and predict the contributions of anthropogenic sources of CO2 in the global carbon cycle. Surprisingly few studies have addressed the carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of CO2 derived from coal combustion. The goal of this study is to document the relationships between the carbon and oxygen isotope signatures of coal and signatures of the CO2 produced from laboratory coal combustion in atmospheric conditions.
   Six coal samples were selected that represent various geologic ages (Carboniferous to Tertiary) and coal ranks (lignite to bituminous). Duplicate splits of the six coal samples were ignited and partially combusted in the laboratory at atmospheric conditions. The resulting coal-combustion gases were collected and the molecular composition of the collected gases and isotopic analyses of delta C-13 of CO2, delta C-13 of CH4, and delta O-18 of CO2 were analysed by a commercial laboratory. Splits (similar to 1 g) of the un-combusted dried ground coal samples were analyzed for delta C-13 and delta O-18 by the U.S. Geological Survey Reston Stable Isotope Laboratory.
   The major findings of this preliminary work indicate that the isotopic signatures of delta C-13 (relative to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite scale, VPDB) of CO2 resulting from coal combustion are similar to the delta C-13(VPDB) signature of the bulk coal (-28.46 to -23.86 %.) and are not similar to atmospheric delta C-13(VPDB) of CO2 (similar to -8 %., see http:// www.esrlnoaa.gov/gmd/outreach/isotopes/c13tellsus.html). The 6180 values of bulk coal are strongly correlated to the coal dry ash yields and appear to have little or no influence on the delta O-18 values of CO2 resulting from coal combustion in open atmospheric conditions. There is a wide range of delta C-13 values of coal reported in the literature and the delta C-13 values from this study generally follow reported ranges for higher plants over geologic time. The values of delta O-18 (relative to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water) of CO2 derived from atmospheric combustion of coal and other high-carbon fuels (peat and coal) range from +19.03 to +27.03%o and are similar to atmospheric oxygen delta O-18(vsmow) values which average +23.8L. Further work is needed on a broader set of samples to better define the relationships between coal composition and combustion-derived gases. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The relevance of the research is caused by the need of renewable energy sources share increase in the fuel and energy balance to reduce harmful impact on the environment.
   The main aim of the research is to evaluate the possibility of woody biomass and peat pyrolysis due to heat from the organic part decomposition of the raw material.
   Objects: peat samples from two deposits of the Tomsk region, promising for energy development, - Sukhovsky and Arkadievsky, as well as wood waste of two types - chips and sawdust.
   Methods: physical experiment and differential thermal analysis. Thermotechnical characteristics of woody biomass determined by the methods SS R 56881-2016, SS 33503-2015 and SS R 55660-2013; thermal characteristics of peat - using the SS 11306-2013, SS 11305-2013 and SS R 55660-2013. Calorific value of raw materials determined in the bomb calorimeter ABK-1 (RET, Russia), the elemental composition is determined by the analyser Vario Micro Cube (Elementar, Germany) taking into account the carbon dioxide content of the carbonates, established by volumetric method according to SS 13455-91.
   Results. The authors have established the optimal parameters of pyrolytic processing for various types of biomass, such as pyrolysis temperature and moisture of the raw material. The optimum temperature for pyrolysis of wood waste in the air-dry state is 400 degrees C, at which the total thermal effect is maximum and equal to 36,3 kJ/kg for sawdust and 78,8 kJ/kg for wood chips, for sukhovskoy peat at 500 degrees C total heat effect is equal to 149,7 kJ/kg. The maximum values of moisture, providing coverage of heat costs due to the heat of exothermic reactions, at these pyrolysis temperatures were 10 % for wood waste and 14 % for sukhovskoy peat. The value of the total thermal effect of arkadievsky peat pyrolysis even in the dry state has a negative value.

AB A Pliocene lignite seam up to 160 m thick occurs in the Velenje basin (Slovenia). The seam originated in a topogenous mire and evolved within a non-marine, transgressive setting. Differences in soluble organic matter yield and hydrocarbon content of borehole samples from the lignite are related to differences in the composition of free lipids of microbial origin and/or hydrocarbons derived from the biogeochemical degradation of plant tissue. Variations of the redox conditions within the mire are reflected by pristane/phytane ratios. The abundance of terpenoid biomarkers indicates the predominance of gymnosperms over angiosperms, which is consistent with palynomorphic spectra dominated by pollen of the Sequoia-Taxodium-Metasequoia plant community rather than by angiosperms. Evidence is also provided that the content of land plant derived biomarkers and the preservation of plant tissue is controlled by the input of resin-rich, decay-resistant conifers. Sections of the seam characterized by a high degree of gelification of humotelinite (gelification index) show high contents of hop-17(21)-ene but low hopane concentrations. The results suggest that the gelification of plant tissue may be governed by the activity of anaerobic rather than aerobic bacteria. Despite the minor variation in the proportions of gymnosperms versus angiosperms in the peat-forming vegetation, a general influence of the floral assemblage on carbon isotopic composition of the coals (delta(13)C -25.3 to -27.0parts per thousand) is proposed. Carbon cycling during biogeochemical decomposition of plant tissue by bacteria is assumed to affect the delta(13)C value of the lignite. Petrographic and geochemical data of gelified and ungelified fossil wood provide evidence that gelification may be governed by microorganisms (e.g. anaerobic bacteria) different from those responsible for decreasing cellulose contents during early diagenetic, aerobic degradation of wood. Based on the molecular composition of terpenoid biomarkers, the wood fragments are identified as derived from gymnosperms. The relative proportions of saturated versus aromatic hydrocarbon fractions of fossil gymnosperms display a general tendency towards lower values in gelified wood remains. This indicates that bacteria involved in gelification of plant tissue may also be involved in aromatisation of diterpenoid hydrocarbons. The chemotaxonomical classification of the macrofossils as gymnosperms is corroborated by the mean carbon isotopic compositions of the macrofossils (delta(13)C = -24.5parts per thousand) and the extracted cellulose (delta(13)C = -22.0parts per thousand). The higher isotopic difference of about 2.5%. between cellulose and fossil wood, compared to that found in modern trees, can most probably be explained by the smaller effect of C-13 discrimination for cellulose when compared with wood during decomposition [Chem. Geol. 158 (1999) 121]. Compared with the coals, the delta(13)C values of wood and extracted cellulose are affected to a minor extent by microbial activity. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil carbon (C) is a dynamic and integral part of the global C cycle. It has been a source of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) since the dawn of settled agriculture, depleting more than 320 billion metric tons (Pg.) from the terrestrial pool, 78 +/- 12 Pg of which comes from soil. In comparison, approximately 292 Pg C have been emitted through fossil-fuel combustion since about 1750. However, terrestrial pools can act as a sink for as much as 50 parts per million of atmospheric CO2 for 100 to 150 years. The technical sink capacity of US soils is 0.288 Pg C per year; Earth's terrestrial biosphere can act as a sink for up to 3.8 Pg C per year. The economic potential of C storage depends on its costs and cobenefits, such as global food security, water quality, and soil biodiversity. Therefore, optimally managing the soil C pool must be the basis of any strategy to improve and sustain agronomic production, especially in developing countries.

AB Despite the importance of surface waters of permafrost landscapes in carbon (C) emission and dissolved C and metal storage and export, the majority of available observations in high latitude aquatic systems deal with punctual or seasonal sampling without accounting for diurnal variations in temperature and primary productivity-respiration cycles. Towards providing comprehensive understanding of diet variations in CO2 emission, organic C and element concentrations in lakes of frozen peatlands, we monitored, each 2 h over 2 days, the water temperature, pH, CO2 fluxes, CO2, CH4, dissolved organic- and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC, respectively), nutrients, carboxylic acids, bacterial number, and major and trace elements in two acidic (pH = 3.6 and 4.0) and humic (DOC = 15 and 35 mg L-1) thermokarst lakes of discontinuous permafrost zone in Western Siberia. We discovered a factor of 2 to 3 higher CO2 concentrations and fluxes during the night compared to daytime in the high-DOC lake. The emission fluxes in the low-DOC lake increased from zero to negative values during the day to highly positive values during the end of night and early morning.The methane concentration varied within a factor of 5 without any link to the diurnal cycle. The bulk of dissolved (< 0.45 mu m) hydrochemical parameters remained highly stable with +/- 10% variation in concentration over 2 days of observation (DOC, DIC, SUVA(254nm), carboxylates (formate, oxalate, puryvate and glutarate), Mn, Fe, Al, other trace elements). Concentrations of Si, P, K, Cu varied within +/- 20% whereas those of Zn and Ni ranged by a factor of 2 to 4 without any link to diurnal pattern. Overall, the impact of diel cycle on CH4, DOC, nutrient and metal concentration was below 10%. However, neglecting night-time period may underestimate net CO2 emission by ca. 30 to 50% in small organic-rich thaw ponds and switch the CO2 exchange from uptake/zero to net emission in larger thermokarst lakes. Given the dominance of large lakes in permafrost regions, the global underestimation of the emission flux may be quite high. As such, monitoring CO2 concentrations and fluxes in thermokarst lakes during months of extended night Lime (August to October) is mandatory for assessing the net emissions from lentic waters of frozen peatlands.

AB High-spectral resolution reflectance data were acquired in the laboratory for several species of boreal forest and peatland mosses. Feather mosses and lichens (forests), brown mosses (rich fens), and Sphagnum species (bogs and poor fens) were collected from sites in the northern study area (NSA) of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) near Thompson, Manitoba, and from three peatlands in southeastern New Hampshire. Because mosses are indirect indicators of soil moisture, trace gas flux, and carbon accumulation, these data may enable hyperspectral remote sensing systems, such as the airborne visible and infrared imaging spectrometer and the compact airborne spectrographic imager (AVIRIS) (CASI), as well as future systems such as Lewis and the first New Millennium Project, to infer differences in hydrology and carbon cycling in boreal ecosystems at small spatial scales ((1-900 m(2)). Mosses exhibit distinctly different spectral characteristics from vascular plants in the visible, near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) regions. In the visible portion of the spectrum, mosses exhibit typical absorption in the blue and red regions but differ from vascular plants in having a "green" peak reflective of the color (red, brown, or green) of the individual species. The moss reflectance in the NIR spectral region is typically less reflective than the same region in vascular plants and is characterized by strong water absorption features located at approximately 1.00 and 1.20 mu m, resulting in pronounced reflectance peaks at approximately 0.85, 1.10, and 1.30 mu m (identified as NIR 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The variations in the relative brightness of the three NIR peaks in each of the three groups of mosses (Sphagnum, feather, and brown mosses) are diagnostic and may be indicative of different cellular characteristics. The slope of the NTR plateau as determined by the NIR 3/1 ratio, as well as the shape of the NIR 1 peak and relative dominance of NIR 2, separate the three groups. In addition, the NIR 1 peak in Sphagnum species is marked by a minor absorption feature at 0.85 mu m, which is absent in all brown mosses and feather mosses, as well as in vascular plants. Because this absorption feature results in a narrow NIR 1 peak, and the red absorption is also narrow in Sphagnum, the standard normalized difference vegetation index/simple vegetation index ratio (NDVI/VI) methods do not work well in characterizing biomass or greenness. The overall reflectance of mosses in the SWIR region (1.50-2.50 mu m) is lower than that of vascular plants because of the higher water content of the moss tissue. In lichens, reflectance in this region is higher than either mosses or vascular plants, due likely to tissue dryness. The lichens included in this study are most dissimilar from mosses and vascular plants in the Visible portion of the spectrum.

AB Continuous and excessive use of organophosphorus compounds has led to the contamination of water and soil ecosystems. The degradation of organophosphorus insecticides, chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-methyl, cyanophos and malathion in mineral salts media were studied. The effect of additional biofertilizers, singly or combined with organic amendments, on chlorpyrifos and cyanophos degrading activity in soil were investigated. Paenibacillus (Bacillus) polymyxa (Prazmowski) and Azospirillum lipoferum (Beijerinck) were found to degrade the organophosphorus insecticides, chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-methyl, cyanophos and malathion in mineral salts media as a carbon and phosphorus source. Paenibacillus (Bacillus) polymyxa (Prazmowski) appeared to be more effective than Azospirillum lipoferum in degrading all the tested organophosphate pesticides in mineral salts media. The half-life values (t(1/2)) of chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos methyl, cyanophos and malathion were found to be undetectable, undetectable, 2.4, and undetectable days in mineral salts media inoculated by Paenibacillus (Bacillus) polymyxa (Prazmowski), while they reached 1.6, 0.1, 5.2, and 0.8 days by Azospirillum lipoferum (Beijerinck) compared to 4.4, 1.8, 8.8, and 1.4 days in non-inoculated mineral salts media. Chlorpyrifos and cyanophos degraded in soil samples inoculated by Azospirillum lipoferum (Beijerinck) plus peat- moss more rapidly than in the other treatments. Dual inoculation of Azospirillum lipoferum (Beijerinck) and Paenibacillus (Bacillus) polymyxa (Prazmowski) improved the rate of degradation of chlorpyrifos and cyanophos in soil. Azospirillum lipoferum (Beijerinck) appeared to be more effective than Paenibacillus ( Bacillus) polymyxa (Prazmowski) in degrading soil-applied chlorpyrifos and cyanophos. These results highlight the potential of these bacteria to be used in the clean-up of contaminated pesticides - waste in the environment.

TI Drivers of long-term variability in CO2 net ecosystem exchange in a

AB Land atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) in peatlands exhibits marked seasonal and interannual variability, which subsequently affects the carbon (C) sink strength of catchments across multiple temporal scales. Long-term studies are needed to fully capture the natural variability and therefore identify the key hydrometeorological drivers in the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2. Since 2002, NEE has been measured continuously by eddycovariance at Auchencorth Moss, a temperate lowland peatland in central Scotland. Hence this is one of the longest peatland NEE studies to date. For 11 years, the site was a consistent, yet variable, atmospheric CO2 sink ranging from -5.2 to -135.9 g CO2-Cm-2 yr(-1) (mean of -64.1 +/- 33.6 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)). Inter-annual variability in NEE was positively correlated to the length of the growing season. Mean winter air temperature explained 87% of the inter-annual variability in the sink strength of the following summer, indicating an effect of winter climate on local phenology. Ecosystem respiration (R-eco) was enhanced by drought, which also depressed gross primary productivity (GPP). The CO2 uptake rate during the growing season was comparable to three other sites with long-term NEE records; however, the emission rate during the dormant season was significantly higher. To summarise, the NEE of the peatland studied is modulated by two dominant factors:
   - phenology of the plant community, which is driven by winter air temperature and impacts photosynthetic potential and net CO2 uptake during the growing season (colder winters are linked to lower summer NEE),
   - water table level, which enhanced soil respiration and decreased GPP during dry spells.
   Although summer dry spells were sporadic during the study period, the positive effects of the current climatic trend towards milder winters on the site's CO2 sink strength could be offset by changes in precipitation patterns especially during the growing season.

AB Mineralization of pentachlorophenol (PCP) was studied in non-sterile soil using Rhodococcus chlorophenolicus strain PCP-1. The effect of the inoculum size, concentration of PCP and soil moisture on mineralization of PCP was investigated in two different types of soil. Non-sterile peaty and sandy soils, containing from 30 to 600 mg of PCP kg-1 soil dry wt were inoculated to a density of from 500 to 10(8) R. chlorophenolicus cells g-1 soil.
   A mass balance of PCP-carbon and -chloride in the inoculated soils was made after exposure for 200 days. The products from PCP-mineralized carbon and released chloride were related to the degraded PCP in highly-contaminated soils. The degree of mineralization of PCP responded positively to an increase in the numbers of R. chlorophenolicus cells. The mineralizing capacity per inoculant cell was higher (40 fg PCP day-1) in soil with 350 and 600 mg PCP kg-1 dry wt than in soil with 30 mg PCP kg-1 dry wt (4 fg PCP day-1). The mineralization was similar in soil with a high content of organic matter (30%) to that in mineral soil (1 % organic matter). The rate of degradation of PCP by indigenous soil microbes in sand and in peat was equivalent to 0.3 and 1 mg PCP kg-1 dry wt month-1, respectively. This indicates that unforced bioremediation would require years for completion, even at a low concentration of PCP pollution. The results also show that more than 10(7) active R. chlorophenolicus cells should be applied g soil to ensure effective mineralization of PCP in the soil.

AB Natural peatlands represent a long-term sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), however, drained and extracted peatlands can represent a source of atmospheric CO2. The restoration of Sphagnum mosses on abandoned milled peatlands has the potential to sequester atmospheric CO2 thereby returning the peatland to a peat accumulating system. Micrometeorological and chamber measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange are proven methods for investigating production and decomposition processes in both natural, extracted, and restored peatlands. However, this approach is relatively expensive because of infrastructure and human resources that not only limits potential use for ecological managers but it limits the number of sites that can be monitored due to high spatial variability. Here we present crank wire and destructive sampling production measurements, litter bag decomposition measurements and measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange made in a restored peatland and natural peatland sites nearby. The objectives were to assess production and decomposition rates in the two systems as well as to compare the different measurements techniques.
   Estimates of Sphagnum fuscum production at a restored peatland, using the different methods, followed the trend: crank wire < destructive sampling < gas exchange, with the two last methods providing comparable estimates. Production estimates using crank wires in cutover peat surfaces with a thin newly formed Sphagnum mat were shown unreliable due to peat subsidence. Results using the destructive sampling method suggest that Sphagnum production varies between species (S. fuscum > S. capillifolium) according to their ability to withstand harsh conditions on restored peat surfaces. Decomposition rate was also significantly greater (p < 0.05) for S. capillifolium than S. fuscum, resulting in an overall plant accumulation greater for S. fuscum. Although the restored surfaces were fairly young, production rates estimated on cutover surfaces that were fully covered with a thin Sphagnum mat compared with production rates observed in natural sites nearby.

AB The climate sensitivity of microbe-mediated soil processes such as carbon and nitrogen cycling offers an interesting case for evaluating the corresponding sensitivity of microbial community composition to environmental change. Better understanding of the degree of linkage between functional and compositional stability would contribute to ongoing efforts to build mechanistic models aiming at predicting rates of microbe-mediated processes. We used an amplicon sequencing approach to test if previously observed large effects of experimental soil warming on C and N cycle fluxes (50-100% increases) in a sub-arctic Sphagnum peatland were reflected in changes in the composition of the soil bacterial community. We found that treatments that previously induced changes to fluxes did not associate with changes in the phylogenetic composition of the soil bacterial community. For both DNA-and RNA-based analyses, variation in bacterial communities could be explained by the hierarchy: spatial variation (12-15% of variance explained) > temporal variation (7-11%) > climate treatment (4-9%). We conclude that the bacterial community in this environment is stable under changing conditions, despite the previously observed sensitivity of process rates-evidence that microbe-mediated soil processes can alter without concomitant changes in bacterial communities. We propose that progress in linking soil microbial communities to ecosystem processes can be advanced by further investigating the relative importance of community composition effects versus physico-chemical factors in controlling biogeochemical process rates in different contexts.

AB Soils impact global carbon cycling and their resident microbes are critical to their biogeochemical processing and ecosystem outputs. Based on studies in marine systems, viruses infecting soil microbes likely modulate host activities via mortality, horizontal gene transfer, and metabolic control. However, their roles remain largely unexplored due to technical challenges with separating, isolating, and extracting DNA from viruses in soils. Some of these challenges have been overcome by using whole genome amplification methods and while these have allowed insights into the identities of soil viruses and their genomes, their inherit biases have prevented meaningful ecological interpretations. Here we experimentally optimized steps for generating quantitatively-amplified viral metagenomes to better capture both ssDNA and dsDNA viruses across three distinct soil habitats along a permafrost thaw gradient. First, we assessed differing DNA extraction methods (PowerSoil, Wizard mini columns, and cetyl trimethylammonium bromide) for quantity and quality of viral DNA. This established PowerSoil as best for yield and quality of DNA from our samples, though similar to 1/3 of the viral populations captured by each extraction kit were unique, suggesting appreciable differential biases among DNA extraction kits. Second, we evaluated the impact of purifying viral particles after resuspension (by cesium chloride gradients; CsCl) and of viral lysis method (heat vs bead-beating) on the resultant viromes. DNA yields after CsCl particle-purification were largely non-detectable, while unpurified samples yielded 1-2-fold more DNA after lysis by heat than by bead-beating. Virome quality was assessed by the number and size of metagenome-assembled viral contigs, which showed no increase after CsCI-purification, but did from heat lysis relative to bead-beating. We also evaluated sample preparation protocols for ssDNA virus recovery. In both CsCl-purified and non-purified samples, ssDNA viruses were successfully recovered by using the Accel-NGS 1S Plus Library Kit. While ssDNA viruses were identified in all three soil types, none were identified in the samples that used bead-beating, suggesting this lysis method may impact recovery. Further, 13 ssDNA vOTUs were identified compared to 582 dsDNA vOTUs, and the ssDNA vOTUs only accounted for similar to 4% of the assembled reads, implying dsDNA viruses were dominant in these samples. This optimized approach was combined with the previously published viral resuspension protocol into a sample-to-virome protocol for soils now available at protocols.io, where community feedback creates 'living' protocols. This collective approach will be particularly valuable given the high physicochemical variability of soils, which will may require considerable soil type-specific optimization.

AB Soil erosion exacerbates the reduction of soil organic matter (SOM) and destruction of soil physical structure in agricultural systems, which seriously threatens agricultural ecological environment and global sustainable agriculture development. Owing to rich SOM and nutrients of woody peat results in it's widely applied in degraded soil for improving land productivity. But how the impacted of woody peat addition on crop growth and soil organic matter (SOM) in different textured degenerated erodible soils are not well understood. Here, along the latitudinal gradient from north to south of China, four typical regional soils collected in Northeast (black soil), Northwest (loessial soil), Central (lou soil) and South (red soil) of China, where suffered strongly soil erosion. Soil clay content was 37.0%, 16.9%, 29.6%, and 38.5% for the black, loessial, lou, and red soils, respectively. We conducted a plot incubation experiment in a fully ventilated, rainproof outdoor greenhouse for planting wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The study is aimed to investigate the response of different texture eroded soil to crop growth and physiology, soil evaporation and soil organic matter after woody peat addition. Eight treatments have been designed for four soils with two groups. (i) the control group with no woody peat addition, B0, H0, L0 and R0; (ii) woody peat addition group, BW, HW, LW and RW. Overall, the SOM concentration altered wheat growth characteristic and grain yield in the four typical erosion degraded soils. The highest grain yield of winter wheat is 6.5 +/- 1.3 g per plot in B0 and 6.5 +/- 1.1 g per plot in BW, and the lowest is 0.4 +/- 0.1 g per plot in R0 in red soil. But woody peat addition increased the wheat yield or yield variation, the wheat gain yield increased four times with woody peat addition (RW) than control (R0) in red soil. In addition, the results revealed that the SOM content were increased in black soil by 40.4%, in loessial soil by 40.0%, in lou soil by 101.3%, and in red soil by 94.6% when compared to the control treatments at harvest. From sowing to harvest, SOM decreased by 5.1 +/- 1.8 g kg-1 (black soil), 9.9 +/- 0.9 g kg-1 (loessial soil), 7.6 +/- 1.8 g kg-1 (lou soil), and 6.2 +/- 1.0 g kg-1 (red soil) in the soils with woody peat addition. Without woody peat addition, SOM decreased by 5.6 g kg-1 (black soil), 4.7 g kg-1 (lou soil), and 0.6 g kg-1 (red soil), but increased by 0.4 g kg-1 in loessial soil. In conclusion, woody peat addition resulted in wheat yield increasing in the degenerated soils, but it's significant in the red soil with adequate nutrient supply and increased soil acid buffering capacity. Woody peat addition increased the SOM concentration in the four degenerated soils, but a faster decreasing rate of the Delta SOM in coarse-textured loessial soil than others medium-fine texture soils. Therefore, appropriate woody peat application and clay content is more conducive to the protection of SOM. More deeply research should have been focused on the impact of woody peat addition in coarse-textured soil on the soil environment (such as the clay type, content, and soil priming effect, etc.).

AB Methanotrophs are a fascinating group of bacteria that have the unique ability to grow on methane as their sole carbon and energy source. They appear to be widespread in nature and have been isolated from a number of different environments, including soils, sediments, freshwater, marine sediments, seawater, acid peal bogs, hot springs and cold environments such as the Antarctic. There are now eight recognised genera of methanotrophs. Methanotrophs have attracted a great deal of interest over the past 30 years since they have considerable potential for the production of bulk chemicals, fine chemicals and in bioremediation processes, such as the degradation of the groundwater pollutant trichloroethylene. More recently, they are being extensively studied in a wide variety of environments since methanotrophs play a critical role in the global methane cycle. Polymerase chain reaction-based methods have been used to study the ecology and diversity of methanotrophs. We review here molecular ecology methods that are already available or which are currently being developed for methanotrophs. These are based on 16S ribosomal RNA technology and specific amplification of 'functional genes', such as those encoding unique enzymes in the metabolism of these organisms including methane monooxygenase and methanol dehydrogenase.

AB Peatlands are long-term sinks of atmospheric carbon (C) largely due to water-saturated soil conditions, decay-resistant plant litter, and the presence of biochemical compounds such as soluble phenolics. As phenolics are known inhibitors of microbial enzymes in soils, the concept of the 'enzymic latch' on peat C was introduced, assuming that phenolics accumulate in peat water due to protection from degradation by oxidative enzymes as a result of anoxia. However, their inhibitory role in peat has not been unambiguously confirmed.
   We aimed to verify whether peat phenolics inhibit microbial and enzyme activities in laboratory-incubated Sphagnum litter, and bog and fen peat. Soluble humic substances were extracted from bog water as a source of natural phenolics and separated into two molecular-weight fractions. We tested the effects of (1) phenolics concentration, (2) their molecular weight and (3) anoxia on the activity of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes, and on microbial respiration rate.
   The added phenolics did not suppress hydrolytic enzyme activities nor microbial respiration. Quite the contrary, phenolics addition (up to 1000 mg L-1) sometimes supported enzyme and microbial activities, indicating that phenolics (or another constituent of peat humic substances) served as a source of C. The activities of hydrolytic enzymes did not vary between oxic and anoxic peat but were double in oxic than anoxic conditions in Sphagnum litter. Differences in enzymatic and microbial activities were driven by peat type with about three times greater microbial respiration rates and enzyme activities in fen peats.
   Our results do not support the concept of the enzymic latch, particularly its key assumption that peat phenolics inhibit hydrolytic enzymes. While the concept was established on oceanic peatlands with low phenolic concentrations, the peat microbial community in our experiments seemed acclimated to the naturally high phenolic concentrations, characteristic for other, non-oceanic northern peatlands. Thus, the enzymic latch should not be considered as a determinative mechanism preserving the global C store in peatlands. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) simulates fully coupled processes and interactions among water, energy, carbon and nutrient cycles. E3SM connects vegetation and soil dynamics through nutrient uptake, plant production, litterfall and decomposition as a function of abiotic parameters (e.g. temperature and moisture). However, E3SM is designed to characterize terrestrial ecosystems and connects land and open ocean systems using a single streamflow transport term, ignoring the complex dynamics of energy, water, carbon, and nutrients in coastal systems. The goals of our project were to: (1) Parameterize a point version of E3SM to capture coastal wetland habitats and (2) Determine marsh community responses to increased temperature and elevated CO2. We adapted a version of the E3SM land model, previously configured to represent forested bog hydrology to a coastal ecosystem using datasets from field experiments conducted at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center?s Global Change Research Wetland (GCReW). Tidal forcing in a marsh environment was simulated using a two-column system in which the columns are connected by lateral hydrologic flows. One column simulates interactions between vegetation and soil while a second column simulates variation in water level (both tidal and sea level rise). The updated model captures many aspects of the field experiments, showing that plant community responses to environmental change are non-linear, non-additive and different between plant types. Elevated CO2 treatments increased C3 plant biomass more than C4 (33% vs 17%). Temperature exacerbated CO2 responses in C3 plants (0 ?C: 26%, 5.1 ?C: 56%). We were more successful at characterizing C3 than C4 responses and simulating above rather than belowground biomass production. Next steps will include updates to key physiological parameters such as root:shoot carbon allocation and the addition of mechanistic feedbacks between vegetation and biogeochemical processes.

AB Wilson, K. S. and Humphreys, E. R. 2010. Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes from Arctic mudboils. Can. J. Soil Sci. 90: 441-449. Climate change is expected to alter the Arctic's carbon (C) balance and changes in these C-rich ecosystems may contribute to a positive feedback on global climate change. Low-center mudboils, a form of patterned ground in the Arctic, are distinct landforms in which the exchange of greenhouse gases between the atmosphere and soil has not been fully characterized, but which may have an important influence on the overall C balance of tundra ecosystems. Chamber systems were used to sample net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and CO2 and CH4 effluxes along a 35-m transect intersecting two mudboils in a wet sedge fen in Canada's Southern Arctic (lat. 64 degrees 52'N, long. 111 degrees 34'W) during the summer months in 2008. Mudboil features gave rise to dramatic variations in vegetation, soil temperature and thaw depth, and soil organic matter content along this transect. Variations in NEE were driven by variations in the amount of vascular vegetation, while CO2 and CH4 effluxes were remarkably similar among the two mudboil (CO2 effluxes: 1.1 +/- 0.9 and 1.4 +/- 0.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); CH4 effluxes: 83.1 +/- 189.4 and 23.1 +/- 9.4 nmol m(-2) s(-1), +/-1 standard deviation) and the sedge fen (CO2 effluxes: 1.6 +/- 0.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); CH4 effluxes: 28.0 +/- 62.0 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) sampling areas. Vegetation appeared to play an important role in limiting temporal variations in CH4 effluxes through plant mediated transport in both mudboil and sedge fen sampling areas. One of the mudboils had negligible vascular plant colonization presumably due to more active frost heave processes. The relatively high CO2 and CH4 efflux in this mudboil area was speculated to be a result of growth and decomposition of cryptogamic organisms, inflow of dissolved organic C, and warmer soil temperatures.

AB Freshwater marshes have been shown to be strong sinks for carbon dioxide (CO2) on an annual basis relative to other wetland types; however it is likely that these ecosystems are also strong emitters of methane (CH4), reducing their carbon (C) sequestration potential. Multiyear C balances in these ecosystems are necessary therefore to determine their contribution to the global C cycle. Despite this, the number of multiyear studies in marshes is few, with, to the best of our knowledge, only one other Northern marsh C balance reported. This study presents five years of eddy covariance flux measurements of CO2, and four years of warm-season chamber measurements of CH4 at a cool-temperate Typha angustifolia marsh. Annual average cumulative net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) at the marsh was -224 +/- 54 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (+/- SD) over the five-year period, ranging from -126 to -284 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Enhancement of the ecosystem respiration during warmer spring, autumn and winter periods appeared the strongest determinant of annual NEE totals. Warm season fluxes of CH4 from the Typha vegetation (avg. 1.0 +/- 1.2 g C m(-2) d(-1)) were significantly higher than fluxes from the water surface (0.5 +/- 0.4 g C m(-2) d(-1)) and unvegetated mats (0.2 +/- 0.2 g C m(-2) d(-1)). Air temperature was a primary driver of all CH4 fluxes, while water table was not a significant correlate as water levels were always at or above the vegetative mat surfaces. Weighting by the surface cover proportion of water and vegetation yielded a net ecosystem CH4 emission of 127 +/- 19 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Combining CO2 and CH4, the annual C sink at the Mer Bleue marsh was reduced to -97 +/- 57 g C m(-2) yr(-1), illustrating the importance of accounting for CH4 when generating marsh C budgets.

AB Organic carbon and iron transport into the Gulf of Bothnia and the seasonal changes in the nature of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were studied in 1983 and 1984 at the mouth of the River Kiiminkijoki, which crosses an area of minerotrophic mires in northern Finland. Organic and inorganic transport within the drainage basin was studied in the summer and autumn of 1985 and 1986, and information was also acquired on the nature of DOM by gel filtration in river, brook and peat mining water. The river water is organically coloured, with high organic matter, Fe concentrations and transport rates, while the values for phosphorus and nitrogen are low. The organic carbon concentrations increase with discharge with the major organic load restricted to the time of spring floods. The results indicate that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is mainly of terrestrial origin, leaching mostly from peatlands. Autochthonous DOC sources seem also to be important in summer. The DOC concentrations decrease under low flow conditions probably mainly due to sedimentation and decomposition of humic substances. The proportion of drifting algae as a particulate organic carbon (POC) source seems to increase in summer. The changes in the ratio of Fe/DOC, the colour of the DOM and the ratio of fluorescence to DOC with discharge give indications of the origin, formation, nature and fate of the DOM in the river water. Temperature-dependent microbiological processes in the formation and sedimentation of Fe-organic colloids seem to be important. Estimates are given for the amounts and transport rates of organic carbon and Fe discharged into the Gulf of Bothnia by river. High apparent molecular weight (HAMW) organic colloids are important for the organic, Fe and P transport in the basin. The gel filtration data suggest that the DOM in the water consists mainly of fulvic acids, although humic acids are also important. The apparent molecular weight of the DOM is higher than in the lakes in the area of ombrotrophic peatlands in southern Finland. Colour in this humic water increases with DOC and Fe concentrations. The results indicate an increase in the mobilization of HAMW Fe-organic colloids in the peatlands following drainage and peat mining. The transport of inorganic nitrogen from the peatlands in the area and in the river is increasing due to peat mining. The corresponding changes in the transport of organic matter, Fe and P are less marked but point in a similar direction.

AB Nitrogen excess is a key trigger for the eutrophication of water bodies. Stormwater is an important nitrogen source in urban environments and thus requires effective treatment, especially in mountainous cities due to their stronger runoff flushing. However, the design method of bioretention systems focusing on mountainous cities is still rare in China and nitrogen is often released due to the lack of denitrification environments. In this study, the stepped bioretention systems were designed based on the terrain characteristics in mountainous cities by two columns in the stair-stepping connection. From 2015-2016, 18 replicates of stepped bioretention systems, which included a 400 mm deep planting layer, a 200 mm deep transition layer and a 200 mm gravel layer planted with Radermachera hainanensis (Merr.), Juncus effusus (L.), Vetiveria zizanioides (L.), Ophiopogon japonicus (Linn. f.) and Medicago sativa (L.)., respectively, were tested under certain operational conditions (e.g., the simulated rainfall intensity was 3.5, 5.3 and 14 mm/h, respectively.). The stepped columns planted with Medicago sativa (L.). showed poor nitrogen removal (e.g., the RRTN (removal rate of TN) was from-29.8% to-123.0%), while those planted with Radermachera hainanensis (Merr.), Juncus effusus (L.), Ophiopogon japonicas (Linn. f.) or Vetiveria zizanio ides (L.) performed well without additional carbon sources (e.g., the RRTN was from 52.8% to 84.2%). Nitrogen would be released from the systems (e.g., the average RRTN was-178.0%) when peat soil was mixed in the planting layer at a ratio of 20%. After retrofitting the flow pattern within the stepped columns, U flow pattern was more advantageous for the improvement of nitrogen removal. In the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 10th and 11th systems, the average RRTN and RRNO3-N (removal rate of NO3-N) in the systems with U flow pattern were 1.2-7.0% and 5.0-5.8%, both higher than those with W flow pattern. Through leaching dynamics analysis, NH3-N-C (NH3-N Concentration) of all effluent samples was <0.5 mg/L, but the concentrations of TN and NO3 N were increased with the duration of rainfall events. Generally, RRTN was significantly correlated to TN-C (TN Concentration), NH3-N-C, NO3-N-C (NO3 N Concentration) and D (Depth of saturated zone), while RRNH3-N (Removal Rate of NH3-N) was associated with ID (Interval Days between rainfall events). Our results suggested that the stepped bioretention systems should be recommended in mountainous cities if nitrogen discharges posed a potential threat to the receiving environments.

AB In the Trbovlje region (Slovenia), an upper Oligocene coal seam up to 30 in thick developed in a topogenous mire and evolved within a transgressive setting. The lower ash-rich part of the seam (unit I) accumulated in a forest swamp strongly influenced by fluvial activity. Palynomorph spectra are dominated by Taxodiaceae-Cupressaceae pollen. Ash yields decrease in the middle (unit II) and upper part of the seam (unit III), indicating decreasing fluvial activity. An increase in CaO contents reflects increasing amounts of inflowing water from an alkaline take, which progressively controlled peat hydrology in units II and III. High sulfur contents in the nonmarine coal are a result of the carbonate-rich water. Abundant pollen and spores from Myricaceae and Polypodiaceae indicate that unit II represents a bush moor. During deposition of unit III, this environment was replaced by a reed moor. Sapropelic coal (unit IV) and sapropelic shale (unit V) accumulated in a relatively large lake, which was established by another water table rise.
   The interpreted environmental changes are confirmed by biomarker data. Pristane/phytane ratios reflect variations of the redox conditions within the mire and reach a minimum in the sapropelic unit IV. The abundances of gymnosperm- and angiosperm-derived terpenoid hydrocarbons testify the predominance of gymnosperms over angiospenns during early peat stages (unit I), and increasing proportions of angiosperms during deposition of units II and III. Highest contents of diterpenoids coincide with maxima in the preservation of plant tissue (TPI) within unit I (wet forest swamp), suggesting that TPI is partly controlled by the input of resin-rich, decay-resistant conifers. Sections of the seam characterized by advanced gelification show low steroids/hopanoids ratios. The results imply that gelification of plant tissue is related to increased microbial activity. Evidence is provided that the hopanes could be used as a measure for the activity of aerobic bacteria, whereas for the hop-17(21)-ene a microbial origin from anaerobic (iron-reducing) bacteria is assumed. A general influence of the floral assemblage and of varying contributions of algal biomass on carbon isotopic composition of the organic matter (delta(13)C = -24.0 to -28.1parts per thousand) is proposed. Carbon cycling during biogeochemical decomposition of plant tissue by bacteria is assumed to affect the delta(13)C values of the coal.
   Fossil wood collected from the seam is identified as derived from gymnosperms, based on the molecular composition of terpenoid hydrocarbons. This chemotaxonomical classification is corroborated by the mean carbon isotopic compositions of the fossil wood (delta(13)C = -24.0parts per thousand) and by the delta(13)C value (-21.8parts per thousand) of the extracted cellulose from one macrofossil. The low cellulose content of the sample (2.7%) together with the slightly higher isotopic difference of 1.6parts per thousand between cellulose and fossil wood, compared to that found in modem trees, can most probably be explained by the possible reversal in C-13 discrimination for cellulose when compared with wood in highly degraded samples.

AB Iron (Fe) plays a key role in elemental cycling at terrestrial-aquatic interfaces by stabilizing carbon (C), phosphorus (P), and nutrient cations through physicochemical associations and by potentially releasing these elements following the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II). However, the ecosystem-scale importance of Fe redox cycling and its responses to climate change remain unclear in precipitation-fed peatlands (bogs), C-rich wetlands with very low mineral content. We tested impacts of Fe redox cycling on C and nutrient release in two bogs in northern Minnesota and in Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE), an ecosystem-scale warming experiment. Concentrations of Fe(III) declined from the peat surface to 50 cm depth (31 to 0.5 mu mol g(-1)) and co-occurred with Fe(II) (10 to 30 mu mol g(-1)). Chemical reduction of Fe(III) released C and P from variably saturated (0-30 cm) peat (106-1006 mu mol C g(-1); 0.6-5 mu mol P g(-1)), and Fe-bound C was similar to previous measurements from upland mineral soils. Concentrations of Fe(II) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were strongly (R-2 = 0.56-0.78) and positively correlated in water samples measured at SPRUCE enclosure outlets and ambient near-surface porewater. Concentrations of Fe(II) also correlated positively with P at warmer SPRUCE temperature treatments and increased with experimental warming, but stabilized at the highest temperature treatments as water depth declined. Although bogs have low total mineral content, mass balance measurements indicated that atmospheric deposition could in principle sustain significant Fe cycling and hydrologic losses in these ecosystems. Overall, Fe redox cycling significantly impacted C and nutrient dynamics in these mineral-poor bogs, contributing to strong correlations between Fe(II) and DOC in water samples. Increased Fe(III) reduction with warmer temperatures will likely promote peatland C and nutrient release, impacting ecosystem C budgets both directly and indirectly by enhancing decomposition and productivity.

AB Natural mires and forested peatlands are known to be very significant sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to aquatic ecosystems. Peatland management operations (e.g., forestry operations, restoration of drained mires and peat mining) and extreme hydrological events may increase the DOC runoff. We hypothesized that an increase in phosphorus (P) leaching, together with near-neutral conditions in recipient lakes will accelerate decomposition of DOC that originates from acidic, nutrient-poor mire waters. The efficiency of DOC utilization was evaluated by measuring microbial respiration and bacterial production (BP) in short-term laboratory experiments with runoff waters from six boreal mire sites. Mere inorganic phosphorus (PO4-P) addition did not affect the rate of respiration or the proportion of decayed DOC. However, in the nutrient-poor bog waters, P addition slightly promoted BP and bacterial growth efficiency (BGE). In contrast, the elevation of pH alone, and the elevation of pH and PO4-P level together, caused a significant increase in respiration and in the proportion of decayed DOC, but did not affect net BP. Elevated pH alone, however, depressed BGE when compared to that under the combined elevation of pH and PO4-P. These results suggest that the increased P availability, e.g., after mire restoration, would slightly benefit bacterial net growth in P-limited waters. However, in near-neutral recipient lakes, the increased microbial decomposition of mire-originated DOC contributes more to carbon dioxide (CO2) supersaturation than potentially supporting detritus-based food chains.

AB Production, transport, and degradation of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) influence carbon (C) and nutrient cycling in both soils and downstream aquatic ecosystems. Here, we assessed the impacts of wildfire on DOM production, composition, and reactivity (biodegradation versus UV degradation) from soils of upland forest and peatland ecosystems. Soil C solubility was lowest for upland char samples, highest from surface soils in unburned spruce stands and decreased with a higher degree of peat humification regardless of fire history. Soil nitrogen (N) became relatively more soluble in both upland and peat soils post-fire, as leachate C/N decreased. Biodegradability was lower for DOM leachates from burned than unburned soils, both in upland and peatland sites. Several DOM composition indices were related to biodegradability; with the strongest relationship for specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (indicator of aromaticity). Parallel factor analysis revealed distinctive characteristics of leachates from burned soils and char that were related to low biodegradability and high UV-mediated losses. Relative to dark incubations, incubation under UV conditions led to greater C losses for highly aromatic leachates, but reduced losses for leachates with low aromaticity. This suggests that UV-mediated degradation could provide a pathway for highly stable terrestrial organic matter, including char, to become rapidly mineralized and released to the atmosphere once it reaches aquatic ecosystems in dissolved form. Together our results demonstrate that wildfire can potentially alter both turnover of DOM in terrestrial soils and linkages between terrestrial and aquatic C cycling through its influence on terrestrial DOM production and composition.

AB Northern boreal peatlands are major terrestrial sinks of organic carbon and these ecosystems, which are highly sensitive to human activities and climate change, act as sensitive archives of past environmental change at various timescales. This study aims at understanding how the climate changes of the last 1000 years have affected peatland vegetation dynamics in the boreal region of Alberta in western Canada. Peat cores were collected from five bogs in the Fort McMurray region (56-57 degrees N), at the southern limit of sporadic permafrost, and two in central Alberta (53 N and 55 N) outside the present-day limit of permafrost peatlands. The past changes in vegetation communities were reconstructed using detailed plant macrofossil analyses combined with high-resolution peat chronologies (C-14, atmospheric bomb pulse C-14, Pb-210 and cryptotephras). Peat humification proxies (C/N, HNC, bulk density) and records of pH and ash content were also used to improve the interpretation of climate-related vegetation changes. Our study shows important changes in peatland vegetation and physical and chemical peat properties during the Little Ice Age (LIA) cooling period mainly from around 1700 CE and the subsequent climate warming of the 20th century. In some bogs, the plant macrofossils have recorded periods of permafrost aggradation during the LIA with drier surface conditions, increased peat humification and high abundance of ericaceous shrubs and black spruce (Picea mariana). The subsequent permafrost thaw was characterized by a short-term shift towards wetter conditions (Sphagnum sect. Cuspidata) and a decline in Picea mariana. Finally, a shift to a dominance of Sphagnum sect. Acutifolia (mainly Sphagnum fuscum) occurred in all the bogs during the second half of the 20th century, indicating the establishment of dry ombrotrophic conditions under the recent warmer and drier climate conditions.

AB Bog systems tend to have a flashy hydrological regime with low baseflows and rapid and high storm peaks. Water derived from peatlands often contains significant amounts of organic humic and fulvic materials which form the largest fraction of the dissolved organic carbon component of the fluvial carbon flux. However, most estimates of dissolved organic carbon flux from peatlands are based on sampling that is infrequent and which may miss the periods of high flux during storm events. In order to better characterize the behaviour and fluxes of fluvial carbon it is necessary to operate more frequent sampling. This paper presents data from a continuously operating field-based spectrophotometer simultaneously measuring absorbance across 200-730 nm at 2.5 nm intervals in runoff from an upland peatland stream. It is shown that absorbance at different wavelengths that have previously been used to characterize dissolved organic carbon varies rapidly during storm events. The probe is shown to even detect changes in absorbance characteristics in response to rainfall events before the stream discharge starts to rise. The high-resolution behaviour of absorbance characteristics during storm events is different depending on the wavelength studied. Thus, the choice of wavelength used as a proxy for dissolved organic carbon needs careful attention and it may be that automated spectrophotometric methods which provide rich time-series data from across the spectrum can tell us more about fluxes, processes and sources of aquatic carbon in peatland systems in the future than traditional practices have hitherto allowed.

AB Sphagnum peatlands represent a globally significant pool and sink of carbon but these functions are threatened by ongoing climate change. Testate amoebae are useful bioindicators of hydrological changes, but little experimental work has been done on the impact of water table changes on communities.
   Using a mesocosm experimental setting that was previously used to assess the impact of drought disturbance on communities and ecosystem processes with three contrasted water table positions: wet (-4 cm), intermediate (-15 cm) and dry (-25 cm), we studied the capacity of testate amoeba communities to recover when the water table was kept at -10 cm for all plots. The overall experiment lasted three years. We assessed the taxonomic and functional trait responses of testate amoeba communities. The selected traits were hypothesised to be correlated to moisture content (response traits: shell size, aperture position) or trophic role (effect traits: mixotrophy, aperture size controlling prey range).
   During the disturbance phase, the mixotrophic species Hyalosphenia papilio dominated the wet and intermediate plots, while the community shifted to a dominance of "dry indicators" (Corythion dubium, Nebela tincta, Cryptodifflugia oviformis) and corresponding traits (loss of mixotrophy, and dominance of smaller taxa with ventral or ventral-central aperture) in dry plots. During the recovery phase we observed two contrasted trends in the previously wet and intermediate plots: communities remained similar where the Sphagnum carpet remained intact but species and traits indicators of drier conditions increased in plots where it had degraded. In the former dry plots, indicators and traits of wet conditions increased by the end of the experiment.
   This is one of the first experiment simulating a disturbance and subsequent recovery in ex-situ mesocosms of Sphagnum peatland focusing on the response of testate amoebae community structure as well as functional traits to water table manipulation. The results generally confirmed that testate amoebae respond within a few months to hydrological changes and thus represent useful bioindicators for assessing current and past hydrological changes in Sphagnum peatlands.

AB Photochemical transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a very important role in the cycling of organic carbon in aquatic systems. Increasing release of photoactive nanoparticles such as titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano TiO2) into surface water may impact this process. The present study employed Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) to examine the molecular transformation of natural DOM (peat DOM, DOMp) and anthropogenic DOM (sludge-derived DOM, DOMs) under photo-irradiation as affected by nano TiO2. Differences in molecular components between DOMp and DOMs were observed. DOMs contained more heteroatom formulas (76%) with low aromaticity and low carbon oxidation state than did DOMp (22%). The presence of nano TiO2 resulted in significant decreases in both DOM content and molecular diversity under photo-irradiation. Consistent alterations were observed between DOMp and DOMs such that high molecular weight compounds, high aromaticity and/or heteroatom S-containing compounds were more easily photodegraded in the presence of nano TiO2; whereas the average carbon oxidation state decreased in DOMp but increased in DOMS, likely due to the significant differences in 0 abundance, especially in the contents of carboxyl moieties, between DOMp and DOMs. The findings of the present study suggest that the release of nano TiO2 into aquatic environment will accelerate the consumption of dissolved organic carbon and the attenuation of molecular diversity for both DOM in waters.

AB Dendrochronological investigations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L) growing on Mannikjarve peatland in central Estonia showed that annual tree growth of peatland pines can be used as a proxy for past variations of water table levels. Reconstruction of past water table levels can help us to better understand the dynamics of various ecological processes in peatlands, e.g. the formation of vegetation patterns or carbon and nitrogen cycling. Mannikjarve bog has one of the longest water table records in the boreal zone, continuously monitored since 1956. Common uncertainties encountered while working with peatland trees (e.g. narrow, missing and wedging rings) were in our case exacerbated with difficulties related to the instability of the relationship between tree growth and peatland environment. We hypothesized that the instable relationship was mainly due to a significant change of the limiting factor, i.e. the rise of the water table level due to human activity. To test our hypothesis we had to use several novel methods of tree-ring chronology analysis as well as to test explicitly whether undetected missing rings biased our results. Since the hypothesis that the instable relationship between tree growth and environment was caused by a change in limiting factor could not be rejected, we proceeded to find possible significant changes of past water table levels using structural analysis of the tree-ring chronologies. Our main conclusions were that peatland pines can be proxies to water table levels and that there were several shifting periods of high and low water table levels in the past 200 years.

AB Eddy covariance (EC) estimates of carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and energy balance are examined to investigate the functional responses of a mature mangrove forest to a disturbance generated by Hurricane Wilma on October 24,2005 in the Florida Everglades. At the EC site, high winds from the hurricane caused nearly 100% defoliation in the upper canopy and widespread tree mortality. Soil temperatures down to 50 cm increased, and air temperature lapse rates within the forest canopy switched from statically stable to statically unstable conditions following the disturbance. Unstable conditions allowed more efficient transport of water vapor and CO2 from the surface up to the upper canopy layer. Significant increases in latent heat fluxes (LE) and nighttime net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were also observed and sensible heat fluxes (H) as a proportion of net radiation decreased significantly in response to the disturbance. Many of these impacts persisted through much of the study period through 2009. However, local albedo and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) data (the Enhanced Vegetation Index) indicated a substantial proportion of active leaf area recovered before the EC measurements began 1 year after the storm. Observed changes in the vertical distribution and the degree of clumping in newly emerged leaves may have affected the energy balance. Direct comparisons of daytime NEE values from before the storm and after our measurements resumed did not show substantial or consistent differences that could be attributed to the disturbance. Regression analyses on seasonal time scales were required to differentiate the storm's impact on monthly average daytime NEE from the changes caused by interannual variability in other environmental drivers. The effects of the storm were apparent on annual time scales, and CO2 uptake remained approximately 250g C m(-2) yr(-1) lower in 2009 compared to the average annual values measured in 2004-2005. Dry season CO2 uptake was relatively more affected by the disturbance than wet season values. Complex leaf regeneration dynamics on damaged trees during ecosystem recovery are hypothesized to lead to the variable dry versus wet season impacts on daytime NEE. In contrast, nighttime CO2 release (i.e., nighttime respiration) was consistently and significantly greater, possibly as a result of the enhanced decomposition of litter and coarse woody debris generated by the storm, and this effect was most apparent in the wet seasons compared to the dry seasons. The largest pre- and post-storm differences in NEE coincided roughly with the delayed peak in cumulative mortality of stems in 2007-2008. Across the hurricane-impacted region, cumulative tree mortality rates were also closely correlated with declines in peat surface elevation. Mangrove forest-atmosphere interactions are interpreted with respect to the damage and recovery of stand dynamics and soil accretion processes following the hurricane. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Mosses need to be incorporated into Earth system models to better simulate peatland functional dynamics under the changing environment. Sphagnum mosses are strong determinants of nutrient, carbon, and water cycling in peatland ecosystems. However, most land-surface models do not include Sphagnum or other mosses as represented plant functional types (PFTs), thereby limiting predictive assessment of peatland responses to environmental change. In this study, we introduce a moss PFT into the land model component (ELM) of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) by developing water content dynamics and nonvascular photosynthetic processes for moss. The model was parameterized and independently evaluated against observations from an ombrotrophic forested bog as part of the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) project. The inclusion of a Sphagnum PFT with some Sphagnum-specific processes in ELM allows it to capture the observed seasonal dynamics of Sphagnum gross primary production (GPP) albeit with an underestimate of peak GPP. The model simulated a reasonable annual net primary production (NPP) for moss but with less interannual variation than observed, and it reproduced aboveground biomass for tree PFTs and stem biomass for shrubs. Different species showed highly variable warming responses under both ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and elevated CO2 altered the warming response direc- tion for the peatland ecosystem. Microtopography is critical: Sphagnum mosses on hummocks and hollows were simulated to show opposite warming responses (NPP decreasing with warming on hummocks but increasing in hollows), and hummock Sphagnum was modeled to have a strong dependence on water table height. The inclusion of this new moss PFT in global ELM simulations may provide a useful foundation for the investigation of northern peatland carbon exchange, enhancing the predictive capacity of carbon dynamics across the regional and global scales.

AB Lowering of the water table and substantial drying are observed in peatlands worldwide. A significant drying of European peatlands in the last 200-300 years influenced the vegetation, lowered carbon storage potential in peatlands, and modified microbial diversity. Here, we reconstructed in high resolution hydrological changes, local and extra-local vegetation composition, and fire activity based on a peat core from a Sphagnum-dominated peatland located in a young glacial landscape in Central Eastern Europe, NE Poland. The last ca. 1500 years of history of the Jaczno bog has been supported by a dense accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon (C-14) dating resolution: 20 dates per 400 cm of the peat profile. We also investigated changes in the functional and morphological traits of testate amoebae as well as the functional diversity of testate amoeba communities over time. Our reconstruction showed a rare case of hydrological stability in the peatland over the late Holocene, and no dry shifts were recorded during the study period. Relatively stable hydrological conditions and undisturbed Sphagnum growth enabled the bog to maintain notably high peat accumulation rates. Although increasing human impact has been recorded in the last ca. 400 years, we did not reconstruct strong disturbances (e.g., vast deforestations, intensive grazing or farming, fires) influencing the site. Compared with other hydrological records from Europe, the Jaczno bog was one of the few bogs in Central and Eastern Europe that did not experience drying during the Little Ice Age. Moreover, the traits and functional diversity of testate amoebae did not show any critical turnover. In the last 70 years, human impact on the site decreased, and the area became afforested. Unlike most of the European peatlands, the Jaczno bog possesses high water tables up to the present time. Therefore, our data suggest that nature conservation practices, which target high water tables, are essential to maintain peatlands as a sink and not as a source of carbon in the future.

AB Through model experiments we quantitatively examined fractional methane oxidation and net methane emissions using three model systems which encompass a management gradient from pristine (wetlands) to managed (rice production) to highly engineered (landfills). Fractional methane oxidation is rarely determined in situ; thus our goal was to cross-compare modeling results and major drivers to field and laboratory data for this important parameter in both pristine and managed systems. In the models, management factors are typically introduced as combinations of theoretical relationships, empirical functions, or scaling factors which drive net emissions through forcing of water table variations, availability of degradable organic carbon substrates, input and cycling of major nutrients, variability in plant communities, physical properties for gaseous transport, and indigenous capacity of soils for methane oxidation. The net methane emission and fractional oxidation vary by orders of magnitude within and among the three model systems, yet each model was quite consistent in its predictive ability. This study lays the groundwork for a more unified, modular approach to modeling methane emissions from soil sources where both natural (climatic and ecological) and anthropogenic factors are important drivers.

AB Peat fires in boreal and tundra regions can potentially cause a high CO2 release, because of their large soil carbon stocks. Under current and future climate warming the frequency and intensity of droughts are increasing and will cause the plant community and organic soil to become more susceptible to fire. The organic soil consumption by fire is commonly used as a proxy for fire severity and is a large source of carbon release. However, the role of organic soils in both above- and belowground fire behavior has only rarely been studied. In this study we collected soil and branches from Betula pubescens, Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies obovata from the taiga/tundra ecotone across a large spatial scale. In laboratory fire experiments we burned different fuel type combinations to examine the fire spread through fuel ladders both from branches to soil and vice versa. We found that the tree species identity influences the fire spread from branches to soil and vice versa. The combination of chemical and structural plant traits could explain the stronger interaction between soil and coniferous spruce and pine fuels in a fire ladder compared to the deciduous birch. Therefore, total carbon emission from a boreal forest fire may not only depend on burned plant fuel, but also on the species-specific potential of the trees to ignite the soil. Carbon emission models and forest management could be improved if not only the aboveground plant fuel consumption is considered, but also the interaction between fuels in a fuel ladder and the probability of soil ignition by a forest crown fire and vice versa.

AB Peatlands are important ecosystems for understanding global methane (CH4) and greenhouse gas budgets. We evaluated the CH4 emissions from a cool temperate bog in northern Japan and their responses to environmental drivers based on four years of quasi-continuous measurements with the eddy covariance method. The bog acted as a 13 to 19 g C m(-2) yr(-1) CH4 source. High annual CH4 emissions outweighed the annual carbon dioxide (CO2) sink strength (-223 to -79 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), except in one year, resulting in a net greenhouse gas source at the annual timescale, although greater uncertainties in the annual CO2 budget (14%) than the CH4 budget (5%) caused uncertainties in the greenhouse gas budget. The seasonal variations in the CH4 fluxes were well explained by soil temperatures in the deep layers and the leaf area index of vascular plants. Pressure-driven CH4 emissions were measured at synoptic timescales, indicating high contributions of ebullition emissions. The episodic CH4 emissions during two typhoon events accounted for 5.1% of the annual fluxes in 2018. Nighttime CH4 emissions were greater than daytime emissions during the early growing season, possibly due to the hydrodynamic transport associated with soil temperature instability at night. The annual CH4 emissions were high when the dissolved oxygen concentration at 10 cm was low and the annual CO2 sink was great, suggesting the importance of anaerobic conditions and substrate availability, which facilitate CH4 production and restrict CH4 oxidation. The climate conditions in the study years were within the normal range; thus, further long-term measurements covering a wide range of climatic conditions will be required.

AB We present data on the accumulation of carbon and nitrogen into an open oceanic ombrotrophic bog, SW Sweden, with high levels of anthropogenic nitrogen deposition. The aim was to investigate if this peatland currently acts as a sink for atmospheric carbon. Peat cores were sampled from the top peat layer in five different vegetation types. Small pines were used to date the cores. The cores bulk density and carbon and nitrogen content were determined. A vegetation-classified satellite image was used to estimate the areal extent of the vegetation types and to scale up these results to bog level. The rate of current carbon input into the upper oxic acrotelm was 290 g m(-2) yr(-1), and there were no significant differences in accumulation rates among the vegetation types. This organic matter input to the acrotelm was almost completely decomposed before it was deposited for storage in the deeper peat layers (the catotelm) and only a small fraction (< 1%) or 0.012 g m(-2) yr(-1) of the carbon would be left, assuming a residence time of 100 years in the acrotelm. Nitrogen accumulation rates differed between the vegetation classes, and the average input via primary production varied from 5.33 to 16.8 g m(-2) yr(-1). Current nitrogen input rates into the catotelm are much lower, 0-0.059 g m(-2) yr(-1), with the highest accumulation rates in lawn-dominated communities. We suggest that one of the main causes of the low carbon input rates is the high level of nitrogen deposition, which enhances decomposition and changes the vegetation from peat-forming Sphagnum-dominance to dominance by dwarf shrubs and graminoids.

AB The spatial extent of northern peatlands remains highly uncertain in spite of rapidly developing satellite observation datasets. This is limiting progress in the understanding of fundamental biogeochemical processes, such as the global carbon (C) cycle and climate feedback effects on C fluxes.
   In this study, we evaluated the capabilities of two new satellite datasets that enable regional scale mapping of peatland extent at high spatial resolution, including Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and the Arctic digital elevation model (ArcticDEM). Terrain indices and temporal features derived from these datasets provided input to Random Forest models for delineating four main land cover classes (forest, open upland, water and peatland) in an area in northern Sweden consisting of both lowland and mountainous terrain. The contribution of ArcticDEM to the classification accuracy was assessed by comparing the results with those derived when a high quality LiDAR based DEM (LiDEM) was used as alternative model input.
   This study shows that multi-seasonal SAR alone can produce reasonable classification results in terms of overall accuracy (OA; 81.6%), but also that it has limitations. The inclusion of terrain indices improved classification performance substantially. OA increased to 87.5% and 90.9% when terrain indices derived from ArcticDEM and LiDEM were included, respectively. The largest increase in accuracy was achieved for the peatland class, which suggests that terrain indices do have the ability to capture the features in the geographic context that aid the discrimination of peatland from other land cover classes.
   The relatively small difference in classification accuracy between LiDEM and ArcticDEM is encouraging since the latter provides circumpolar coverage. Thus, the combination of Sentinel-1 time series and terrain indices derived from ArcticDEM presents opportunities for substantially improving regional estimates of peatland extent at high latitudes.

AB The Zillingdorf deposit formed during the late Miocene filling of Lake Pannon and contains Austria's largest lignite reserves. Two lignite seams are present and developed within frequently flooded, low-lying mires in near shore environments. High sulphur contents are due to the influence of the brackish water body of Lake Pannon. During peat accumulation a transgression forced the NW-SE trending shoreline northeastwards. Differences in soluble organic matter (SOM) yield and hydrocarbon content of borehole samples and woody macrofossils are related to differences in the content and composition of free lipids of microbial origin and/or hydrocarbons derived from the biogeochemical degradation of plant tissue. Variations of pristane/phytane ratios are interpreted to reflect differences in the redox conditions of the mire. Peatification in an acidic and aerobic environment is further reflected by the predominance of aromatic over saturated hydrocarbons, the presence of an intense complex mixture in the GC traces due to biodegradation processes, high ratios for diasterenes relative to sterenes, and high concentration ratios of hopanes to hop-17(21)-ene of the respective samples. Gelification of plant tissue is governed by microbial activity, as indicated by the positive relationship between gelification index and hopanoids concentration. The composition of terpenoid biomarkers indicates the predominance of gymnosperms over angiosperms and increasing proportions of angiosperms in the peat-forming vegetation with decreasing depth in the upper scam. From the sesqui- and diterpenoids present in the lignite and fossil wood remnants, a predominant role of species of the Coniferales families Cupressaceae/Taxodiaceae are concluded. The preservation of plant tissue is governed by the presence/absence of decay-resistant gymnosperms. A general influence of the floral assemblage on the isotopic composition of organic carbon of the lignite (delta C-13=-27.2 to -24.6 parts per thousand) is proposed. Decomposition of plant tissue and biogeochemical carbon cycling is assumed to further affect the delta C-13 values of the lignite. Carbon isotope data of fossil wood remnants are consistent with their chemotaxonomical classification as gymnosperms (delta C-13 between -22.5 parts per thousand and -24.9 parts per thousand) and angiosperms (delta C-13 between -25.5 parts per thousand and -26.6 parts per thousand), respectively. The delta C-13 data of the extracted cellulose reveal clear differences between fossil wood from gymnosperms (average delta C-13=-20.3 parts per thousand) and angiosperms (mean delta C-13=-22.9 parts per thousand). The higher isotopic difference of about 3.5 parts per thousand between cellulose and fossil wood, compared to that found in modern trees, is explained by the smaller effect of C-13 discrimination for cellulose when compared with wood during decomposition.

AB Emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from inland waters is recognized as highly important and an understudied part of the terrestrial carbon (C) biogeochemical cycle. These emissions are still poorly quantified in subarctic regions that contain vast amounts of surface C in permafrost peatlands. This is especially true in NE European peatlands, located within sporadic to discontinuous permafrost zones which are highly vulnerable to thaw. Initial measurements of C emissions from lentic waters of the Bolshezemelskaya Tundra (BZT; 200,000 km(2)) demonstrated sizable CO(2)and CH(4)concentrations and fluxes to the atmosphere in 98 depressions, thaw ponds, and thermokarst lakes ranging from 0.5 x 10(6)to 5 x 10(6) m(2)in size. CO(2)fluxes decreased by an order of magnitude as waterbody size increased by > 3 orders of magnitude while CH(4)fluxes showed large variability unrelated to lake size. By using a combination of Landsat-8 and GeoEye-1 images, we determined lakes cover 4% of BZT and thus calculated overall C emissions from lentic waters to be 3.8 +/- 0.65 Tg C yr(-1)(99% C-CO2, 1% C-CH4), which is two times higher than the lateral riverine export. Large lakes dominated GHG emissions whereas small thaw ponds had a minor contribution to overall water surface area and GHG emissions. These data suggest that, if permafrost thaw in NE Europe results in disappearance of large thermokarst lakes and formation of new small thaw ponds and depressions, GHG emissions from lentic waters in this region may decrease.

AB Emissions from biomass burning are a significant source of brown carbon (BrC) in the atmosphere. In this study, we investigate the molecular composition of freshly emitted biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) samples collected during test burns of sawgrass, peat, ponderosa pine, and black spruce. We demonstrate that both the BrC absorption and the chemical composition of light-absorbing compounds depend significantly on the type of biomass fuels. Common BrC chromophores in the selected BBOA samples include nitro-aromatics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives, and polyphenols spanning a wide range of molecular weights, structures, and light absorption properties. A number of biofuel-specific BrC chromophores are observed, indicating that some of them may be used as source-specific markers of BrC. On average, similar to 50% of the light absorption in the solvent-extractable fraction of BBOA can be attributed to a limited number of strong BrC chromophores. The absorption coefficients of BBOA are affected by solar photolysis. Specifically, under typical atmospheric conditions, the 300 nm absorbance decays with a half-life of similar to 16 h. A molecular corridor analysis of the BBOA volatility distribution suggests that many BrC compounds in the fresh BBOA have low saturation mass concentration (<1 mu g m-3) and will be retained in the particle phase under atmospherically relevant conditions.

AB A new genus, Methylocella, and a new species, Methylocella palustris, are proposed for three strains of methane-oxidizing bacteria isolated from acidic Sphagnum peat bogs. These bacteria are aerobic, Cram-negative, colourless, non-motile, straight and curved rods that utilize the serine pathway for carbon assimilation, multiply by normal cell division and contain intracellular poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate granules tone at each pole). These strains use methane and methanal as sole sources of carbon and energy and are moderately acidophilic organisms with growth between ph 4.5 and ph 7.0, the optimum being at ph 5.0-5.5. The temperature range for growth is 10-28 degrees C with the optimum at 15-20 degrees C. The intracytoplasmic membrane system is different from those of type I and II methanotrophs. Cells contain an extensive periplasmic space and a vesicular membrane system connected to the cytoplasmic membrane. The strains grew only on media with a low salt content (0.2-0.5 g l(-1)). All three strains were found to possess soluble methane monooxygenase and are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen via an oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase. No products were observed in a PCR with particulate methane monooxygenase-targeted primers; hybridization with a pmoA probe was also negative. The major phospholipid fatty acids are 18:1 acids. The G+C content of the DNA is 61.2 mol%. The three strains share identical 16S rRNA gene sequences and represent a novel lineage of methane-oxidizing bacteria within the cc-subclass of the class Proteobacteria and are only moderately related to type II methanotrophs of the Methylocystis-Methylosinus group. The three strains are most closely related to the acidophilic heterotrophic bacterium Beijerinckia indica subsp. indica (96.5% 16S rDNA sequence similarity). Collectively, these strains comprise a new species and genus Methylocella palustris gen. nov., sp. nov.; strain K-T (= ATCC 700799(T)) is the type strain.

AB An improved representation of the carbon cycle in permafrost regions will enable more realistic projections of the future climate-carbon system. Currently JULES (the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator) - the land surface model of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) - uses the standard four- pool RothC soil carbon model. This paper describes a new version of JULES (vn4.3_ permafrost) in which the soil vertical dimension is added to the soil carbon model, with a set of four pools in every soil layer. The respiration rate in each soil layer depends on the temperature and moisture conditions in that layer. Cryoturbation/bioturbation processes, which transfer soil carbon between layers, are represented by diffusive mixing. The litter inputs and the soil respiration are both parametrized to decrease with increasing depth. The model now includes a tracer so that selected soil carbon can be labelled and tracked through a simulation. Simulations show an improvement in the large-scale horizontal and vertical distribution of soil carbon over the standard version of JULES (vn4.3). Like the standard version of JULES, the vertically discretized model is still unable to simulate enough soil carbon in the tundra regions. This is in part because JULES underestimates the plant productivity over the tundra, but also because not all of the processes relevant for the accumulation of permafrost carbon, such as peat development, are included in the model. In comparison with the standard model, the vertically discretized model shows a delay in the onset of soil respiration in the spring, resulting in an increased net uptake of carbon during this time. In order to provide a more suitable representation of permafrost carbon for quantifying the permafrost carbon feedback within UKESM, the deep soil carbon in the permafrost region (below 1 m) was initialized using the observed soil carbon. There is now a slight drift in the soil carbon (< 0.018% decade(-1)), but the change in simulated soil carbon over the 20th century, when there is little climate change, is comparable to the original vertically discretized model and significantly larger than the drift.

AB Intact peat bogs are carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks and methane (CH4) sources. Facing drought and drainage, they may turn into CO2 sources and decreased CH4 sources. Information on the CO2 and CH4 exchange of alpine peat bogs in Central Europe has been missing so far. Here, we present data from two years of CO2 and CH4 exchange between an alpine low-shrub pine bog in the Eastern Alps and the atmosphere using the eddy covariance method. The annual net CO2 ecosystem exchange of the peatland differs substantially between the two measurement years, with -24 +/- 13 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the drought affected first year and -84 +/- 13 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the more humid second year. We found ecosystem respiration (R-eco) to depend on variations in soil temperature and soil moisture, and gross primary production (GPP) to be strongly linked to net radiation and daylength. The summer drought in 2015 shifted the peatland from a C sink to a C source, as increases in R-eco clearly exceeded enhanced GPP. Annual CH4 emission was 4.40 +/- 2.40 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during the drought-affected year and 5.24 +/- 2.57 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during the wetter year. Summer CH4 fluxes contribute 44% to the annual balance, followed by autumn (27%), spring (20%) and winter season fluxes (9%). CH4 fluxes most strongly depend on soil temperatures, soil moisture effects increase at smaller time-scales. Annual CH4 emissions are low compared to other temperate bogs, which most likely is the result of the ongoing degradation, indicated by a shift in vegetation composition. Net flux of both greenhouse gases was positive in the first year (+75 g CO2-eq m(-2)) and negative in the second year (-110 g CO2-eq m(-2)). Our results indicate that drought events and seasonal and interannual variations in temperature and precipitation strongly affect the C cycle of alpine peat bogs.

AB Despite the importance of soil and surface waters freezing in permafrost landscapes, the behaviour of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nutrients and metals during periodic freeze-thaw cycles (FTC) remains poorly known. The on-going climate warming is likely to increase the frequency of FTC in continental aquatic settings, which could modify the chemical composition of waters. In this study, we conducted 9 repetitive cycles of overnight freezing (similar to 20 degrees C) and 5 h thawing (4 degrees C) in the laboratory using representative 0.22 mu m-filtered waters from NE European permafrost peatland: leachates of vegetation and soil, and natural surface waters (depression, thermokarst lake and river). Only minor (<5%-15%) changes of DOC concentrations, SUVA(254) and molecular weight were observed in all leachates and the depression water. In contrast, several trace elements (Fe, Al, P, Mn, As, and REE) exhibited sizable variations during FTC (>10%). The leachates and the depression water were enriched in trace elements, whereas the thermokarst lake and the river demonstrated a decrease in concentration of Fe (similar to 39 and similar to 94%, respectively), Al (similar to 9 and similar to 85%), and Mn (similar to 10 and similar to 79%) during FTC. Overall, the observations demonstrated an increase in aliphatic low molecular weight organic matter (OM), and the precipitation of Fe, Al hydroxides and organo-mineral particles. Therefore, enhanced of frequency of FTC can favour the release of metals and toxicants from acidic OM-rich surface waters and maintain stable OM-metalscolloids in large lakes and rivers, thus regulating aquatic transport of DOC and metals from soils to the Arctic Ocean.

AB We studied the effects of experimentally induced variation in leaf litter chemistry on leaf litter decomposition and leaf litter nutrient release of Carer species from habitats that differ in nutrient availability. Carer diandra, C. rostrata, and C. lasiocarpa are dominant in less productive mesotrophic fens, whereas C. acutiformis is dominant in more productive eutrophic fens. For each species, three types of litter were used: litter collected in the field (FLD); and litter from experimental populations grown at low (LN: 3.3 g N . m(-2). yr(-1)) and high N supply (HN: 20.0 g N . m(-2). yr(-1)). For all the litter chemistry parameters studied there were highly significant interactions between species and litter type. This implies that, due to differential plant-mediated controls on leaf litter chemistry, it is not always possible to predict changes in litter chemistry in response to increased nutrient supply.
   Litter decay was determined in a long-term (3 yr) field experiment using litter bags. The litter types of each species were incubated at their native growing sites. Contrary to what is generally found, the leaf litter decomposition rate of the species growing at the nutrient-poorest site (C. diandra) was higher than that of the species growing at the nutrient richest site (C. acutiformis). Only for C. diandra and C. lasiocarpa was the decomposition rate of the litter from the HN treatment higher than that of the field litter. Thus, increased nutrient supply does not necessarily lead to higher litter decomposition rates. Nutrient controls on litter decay changed with time: initial litter decay (less than or equal to 3 mo) was strongly controlled (high r(2) values) by all P-related litter quality parameters, whereas long-term litter decay (>1 yr) was most strongly related with the phenolics : N ratio, the phenolics : P ratio, the lignin : N ratio, and the C:N ratio. Our data suggest that high levels of atmospheric N deposition, such as in the study area (The Netherlands), may lead to a relative shortage of P in the plant-derived substrates for bacteria and fungi. As a result, P-related litter chemistry parameters exert a strong influence on litter decay.
   Our data did not support the hypothesis that high-nutrient species increase nutrient cycling due to the production of easily decomposable litter with high rates of nutrient release. The leaf litter from Carer acutiformis, the species from the high-productivity fens, decomposed more slowly than that of the other species, immobilized more N and P and had a longer period of net N and P immobilization. However, this species has a higher litter production than the other species and thereby increases the rate of nutrient cycling. At the intraspecific level, increased nutrient supply led to lower amounts of immobilized N and P and faster N and P release from litter in most species, and thereby to a higher rate of nutrient cycling. This positive feedback between nutrient supply rate and the rate of nutrient cycling is reinforced by the increase in litter production in response to increased nutrient supply.

AB The coastal zone of southeast Alaska contains thousands of streams and rivers that drain one of the wettest, carbon-rich, and most topographically varied regions in North America. Watersheds draining temperate rainforests, peatlands, glaciers, and three large rivers that flow from the drier interior of the Yukon Territory and British Columbia discharge water and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into southeast Alaskan coastal waters. This area, which we have designated the southeast Alaska drainage basin (SEAKDB), discharges about twice as much water as the Columbia or Yukon Rivers. An understanding of the timing, location, and source of water and DOC guides research to better understand the influence of terrestrial outputs on the adjacent marine systems. Additionally, a spatially extensive understanding of riverine DOC flux will improve our understanding of lateral losses related to terrestrial carbon cycling. We estimate 1.17 Tg C yr(-1) of DOC enters the adjacent marine system along with 430 km(2) of freshwater that influences estuary, shelf, and Gulf of Alaska hydrology. We estimate that 23% to 66% of the DOC entering coastal waters is bioavailable and may influence metabolism and productivity within the marine system. The combination of the large and spatially distributed water and DOC input, long and complex shoreline, large enclosed estuarine volume, and bounded nearshore coastal currents suggests that the physiographic structure of southeast Alaska may have a significant impact on the metabolism of riverine DOC in coastal marine ecosystems.
   Plain Language Summary The coast of southeast Alaska drains coastal rainforests, glaciers, and interior basins in Alaska, British Columbia, and the Yukon. High precipitation, glacier melt, and large interior watersheds combine to discharge an annual volume of freshwater greater than that of the Columbia or Yukon Rivers, which drain basins 3.5 and 4.5 times larger. This large amount of water entering the Alexander Archipelago estuaries and coastal shelf creates currents and density gradients that influence how the river discharge and organic matter in it enter the Gulf of Alaska in the northern Pacific Ocean. Along with the large amount of water there is 1.17 Tg of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which can be taken up by bacteria and other microbes and turned into carbon dioxide or food that can be incorporated into the marine food web. A portion may settle into marine sediments to be stored for long periods of time. The amount and type of DOC and its entry into the marine ecosystem are controlled by watershed characteristics within the southeastern coast of Alaska. A better understanding of where and when DOC and freshwater enter the ocean may help us understand its importance to marine processes.

AB Peatlands represent a vast carbon reserve that has accumulated under conditions of low nitrogen availability. Given the strong coupling between the carbon and nitrogen cycles, we need to establish the consequences of the increase in reactive nitrogen deposition for the sustainability of peatlands, and whether the form in which the nitrogen is deposited makes a difference. We have addressed these questions using a globally unique field simulation of reactive N deposition as dry deposited ammonia and wet deposited reduced N, ammonium and oxidised N, nitrate, added as ammonium chloride or sodium nitrate, to an ombrotrophic peatland, Whim bog in SE Scotland. Here we report the fate of 56 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) additions over 10 yr and the consequences. The effects of 10 yr of reactive N additions depended on the form in which the N was applied. Ammonia-N deposition caused the keystone Sphagnum species, together with the main shrub Calluna and the pleurocarpous mosses, to disappear, exposing up to 30% of the peat surface. This led to a significant increase in soil water nitrate and nitrous oxide emissions. By contrast wet deposited N, despite significantly reducing the cover of Sphagnum and Pleurozium moss, did not have a detrimental effect on Calluna cover nor did it significantly change soil water N concentrations or nitrous oxide emissions. Importantly 10 yr of wet deposited N did not bare the peat surface nor significantly disrupt the vegetation enabling the N to be retained within the carbon rich peatland ecosystems. However, given the significant role of Sphagnum in maintaining conditions that retard decomposition, this study suggests that all nitrogen forms will eventually compromise carbon sequestration by peatlands through loss of some keystone Sphagnum species.

AB Boreal soils play a critical role in the global carbon (C) cycle; therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms that control soil C accumulation and loss for this region. Examining C & nitrogen (N) accumulation rates over decades to centuries may provide additional understanding of the dominant mechanisms for their storage, which can be masked by seasonal and interannual variability when investigated over the short term. We examined longer-term accumulation rates, using Pb-210 and C-14 to date soil layers, for a wide variety of boreal ecosystems: a black spruce forest, a shrub ecosystem, a tussock grass ecosystem, a sedge-dominated ecosystem, and a rich fen. All ecosystems had similar decadal C accumulation rates, averaging 84 +/- 42 gCm(-2) yr(-1). Long-term (century) C accumulation rates were slower than decadal rates, averaging 14 +/- 5 gCm(-2) yr(-1) for all ecosystems except the rich fen, for which the long-term C accumulation rates was more similar to decadal rates (44 +/- 5 and 76 +/- 9 gCm(-2) yr(-1), respectively). The rich fen also had the highest long-term N accumulation rates (2.7 gNm(-2) yr(-1)). The lowest N accumulation rate, on both a decadal and long-term basis, was found in the black spruce forest (0.2 and 1.4 gNm(-2) yr(-1), respectively). Our results suggest that the controls on long-term C and N cycling at the rich fen is fundamentally different from the other ecosystems, likely due to differences in the predominant drivers of nutrient cycling (oxygen availability, for C) and reduced amounts of disturbance by fire (for C and N). This result implies that most shifts in ecosystem vegetation across the boreal region, driven by either climate or succession, will not significantly impact regional C or N dynamics over years to decades. However, ecosystem transitions to or from a rich fen will promote significant shifts in soil C and N storage.

AB Coastal wetlands comprise important global carbon sinks; however, anthropogenic disturbance accompanied with accelerating sea level rise threaten their continued survival. In this study, we quantified habitat disturbance to salt marshes in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, resulting from the construction of ponds for mosquito control. Geographic object-based image analysis of high-resolution four-band aerial imagery revealed that over 7,000 ponds were constructed in the marsh complex with pond densities as high as 290 ponds per km(2). Physical disturbance from pond creation and sediment dispersal extended to over 17% of the bay's tidal wetlands. By tracking recolonization of vegetation, we estimated that it took 5 years for 51% vegetation recovery and 10 years for 69% recovery, with complete recover (100%) not expected for more than 50 years. This suggests that efforts to extend the lifespan of drowning coastal wetlands through sediment additions might disrupt carbon dioxide assimilation, as effects of disturbance persist. Focusing on greenhouse gas exchange, our work found that areas of marsh vegetation contribute to carbon assimilation (-42 g C . m(-2) . year(-1)), while ponds and areas of bare peat created by pond excavation were associated with carbon emissions (44 and 125 g C . m(-2) . year(-1), respectively). These results suggest that the conversion of wetlands to ponds-which is a significant driver of coastal wetland loss worldwide-may convert coastal wetlands from greenhouse gas sinks to sources. Additionally, quantifying the area of vegetation within a marsh (vs. bare ground or open water) is important for quantifying their greenhouse gas mitigation function.
   Plain Language Summary Coastal wetlands are important for our planet as they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Our goal was to determine how the construction of ponds in wetlands-which is common worldwide to support expanding aquaculture-affects the ability of marshes to take up carbon dioxide. We estimated the number and extent of ponds constructed for mosquito control in coastal wetlands in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey. Additionally, we measured greenhouse gas exchange from the ponds, surrounding intact marsh, and in bare areas at several sites across the growing season to estimate the total carbon uptake of the whole marsh. We found that over 7,000 ponds have been dug for mosquito control in New Jersey and that pond density is as high as 290 ponds per km(2). We also found that the ponds constructed in wetlands reduce the ability of wetlands to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

AB Hydrological and geochemical processes controlling the pore water chemistry in a permafrost wetland, with loam overlain by sphagnum peat, were investigated. The vertical distributions of dissolved Cl, and of pore water delta O-18, appeared unrelated to ion freeze-out and isotope ice-water fractionation processes, respectively, dismissing solute freeze-out as a main control on the water chemistry. However, concentrations of major ions, others than Cl, generally increased with depth into the active layer. A conceptual model for water and solute movement in the active layer was derived. The model indicates upward diffusive transport of elements, released in the loam layer by mineral weathering, to the peat layer, in which lateral advective transport dominates. Active layer pore water and water of melted core sections of permafrost were of Ca-Mg-HCO3 type (1: 1: 4 stoichiometry) and were subsaturated for calcite and dolomite. The results are consistent with an annual cycling of inorganic carbon species, Ca and Mg, via cryogenic carbonate precipitation during fall freeze-up and their redissolution following spring thaw. Similarly, elevated Fe2+ concentrations appear to be related to cryogenic siderite formation. Pore water in the active layer showed high partial pressures of CO2, indicating the feasibility of bubble ebullition as a greenhouse gas emission pathway from permafrost wetlands. Elevated concentrations of geogenic trace elements (Ni, Al, and As) were observed, and the controlling geochemical processes are discussed. The conceptual model for water and solute movement was applied to quantify the contribution of released trace elements to a downstream lake in the permafrost catchment.

AB Tidal freshwater marshes can protect downstream ecosystems from eutrophication by intercepting excess nutrient loads, but recent studies in salt marshes suggest nutrient loading compromises their structural and functional integrity. Here, we present data on changes in plant biomass, microbial biomass and activity, and soil chemistry from plots in a tidal freshwater marsh on the Altamaha River (GA) fertilized for 10 yr with nitrogen (+N), phosphorus (+P), or nitrogen and phosphorus (+NP). Nitrogen alone doubled aboveground biomass and enhanced microbial activity, specifically rates of potential nitrification, denitrification, and methane production measured in laboratory incubations. Phosphorus alone increased soil P and doubled microbial biomass but did not affect microbial processes. Nitrogen or P alone decreased belowground biomass and soil carbon (C) whereas +NP increased aboveground biomass, microbial biomass and N cycling, and N, P, and C assimilation and burial more than either nutrient alone. Our findings suggest differential nutrient limitation of tidal freshwater macrophytes by N and microbes by P, similar to what has been observed in salt marshes. Macrophytes outcompete microbes for P in response to long-term N and P additions, leading to increased soil C storage through increased inputs of belowground biomass relative to N and P added singly. The susceptibility of tidal freshwater marshes to long-term nutrient enrichment and, hence their ability to mitigate eutrophication will depend on the quantity and relative proportion of N vs. P entering estuaries and tidal wetlands.

AB In this study, a process-based model (RCG-C) was developed, parameterized and calibrated for studying the annual and seasonal dynamics of the ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in a cutaway peatland (Linnansuo, eastern Finland) cultivated with a perennial bioenergy crop (Phalaris arundinaceae, L., RCG). Based on a number of prior studies and an environmentally controlled experiment, RCG-C emphasized several key processes beyond the generality of previous diplotelmic models for pristine peatlands. These processes included the effects of management (e.g., drainage, peat extraction, tilling, harvesting and fertilization) on the soil hydrology and the cycling of carbon and nitrogen, the influence of climatic factors on photosynthesis and the phenological cycle and phenological and soil-moisture controls on biomass production and canopy development. The model was validated based on continuous measurements of meteorological parameters, energy and CO2 fluxes (eddy covariance system) performed at the site from 2005 to 2010, including variation associated with both wet and dry years. The results showed that the model captured the seasonal and annual trends of the latent heat flux and NEE during the six-year period. Moreover, the simulated values for the total C sink capacity, accumulation of rhizome biomass and peat formation from RCG obtained during the six-year period also agreed well with the field measurements. Based on the FINADAPT climate scenarios, a sensitivity analysis of the model showed that the potential increases in the atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ca) and air temperature (Ta) could be the main forces driving the changes in NEE. The model simulation suggested that the effects of Ta tend to offset those of Ca and lead to a decrease in the total C sink capacity of the site during the main rotation period (4-15th year of cultivation). This decrease tends to become more intensive toward the end of the 21st century. During the period from 2060 to 2099, the total CO2 sink capacity could decrease by 79% during the main rotation period at the Linnansuo site. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To date, few research have been reported on the evolution of C-3/C-4 vegetation in southern China, and the main mechanism influencing the evolution of C-3/C-4 vegetation is unclear. That makes it difficult for researchers to understand the competition mechanism of C-3 and C-4 plants under different climate environments and its relationship with the climate factors. It is also not conducive for researchers to assess the influence of future climate change on regional C-3/C-4 vegetation. Exactly, C-3/C-4 vegetation change in the regional-scale will have a significant impact on the global carbon cycle and agricultural production. Therefore, it is especially important to reconstruct the evolutionary history of C-3/C-4 vegetation in southern China and clarify the influencing mechanism of climate change. In this study, we systematically analyzed stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) of the long-chain n-alkanes in sediment samples from eight lakes and four peat profiles in southern China, to reconstruct the spatiotemporal evolution of C-3/C-4 vegetation in these regions since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and to investigate the climate factors that affect the C-4 plant abundance change in the research area. The integrated long-chain n-alkane (C-27-C-33) stable carbon isotope results of samples from Zhanjiang Huguangyan Maar Lake, Xingyun Lake, Lugu Lake and Dingnan peat showed that, from the LGM to the Early Holocene, C-4 plant relative abundance exhibited a gradually increasing trend from 21% to 34%. In the Middle Holocene, the C-4 plant abundance significantly declined and reached a lowest value of 10%. In space, the C-4 plant abundance generally exhibited a gradually declining trend from south to north in the LGM and the Early Holocene, while it showed an opposite trend in the Holocene Climate Optimum (6.0 cal ka BP). It reflected that the main influencing factor on C-4 plants spatial distribution was changing from temperature to precipitation. This study indicated that temperature was the dominant factor affecting C-4 plant distribution in southern China, however, when the temperature condition was appropriate, an increase in precipitation (especially more spring precipitation) would reduce the competitive advantages of C-4 plants. Therefore, the combination of temperature and seasonal precipitation was the important factor that determines the C-3/C-4 vegetation proportion change in the southern China. Under the premise that the temperature will rise and precipitation will increase in the future, the reduction of a competitive advantage for the C-4 plants could affect agricultural production in China.

AB Soil microbial abundance, which is related to soil characteristics and process rates, is an early indicator of changes in soil health and quality. However, microbial functional groups in permafrost peatland soils have rarely been studied. These soils are important C and N stores and possibly vulnerable to climate warming. We randomly gathered surface soils (0-15 cm and 15-30 cm soil layers) from 10 peatlands in sporadic island, discontinuous island, and continuous permafrost regions in Northeast China. The aim was to clarify the soil microbial abundance distribution in different types of permafrost peatlands. Results revealed different effects of permafrost types on different soil C- and N-cycling microbial abundances in peatlands. The bacteria, amoA, and nirK gene abundances in the two soil layers were the highest in discontinuous island permafrost peatlands. Soil mcrA and pmoA gene abundances in 0-15 cm soil were high in continuous and discontinuous island permafrost peatlands, respectively. The amoA gene abundance in both soil layers and nirS gene abundance in 15-30 cm soil were high in discontinuous island permafrost peatlands. The average nirK gene abundance in both soil layers was in the order: discontinuous island permafrost peatlands > continuous permafrost peatlands > sporadic island permafrost peatlands. No significant differences in archaeal abundance were observed in both soil layers among the different types of permafrost peatlands. Moreover, 42.5%, 15.9%, and 15.3% of the variation in soil microbial abundances could be explained by soil ammonia-N, pH, and total C, respectively. Our results imply that soil microbial abundance can be utilized as effective soil N availability, C pool, and pH indicators in permafrost peatlands.

AB The regional variability in tundra and boreal carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes can be high, complicating efforts to quantify sink-source patterns across the entire region. Statistical models are increasingly used to predict (i.e., upscale) CO2 fluxes across large spatial domains, but the reliability of different modeling techniques, each with different specifications and assumptions, has not been assessed in detail. Here, we compile eddy covariance and chamber measurements of annual and growing season CO2 fluxes of gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) during 1990-2015 from 148 terrestrial high-latitude (i.e., tundra and boreal) sites to analyze the spatial patterns and drivers of CO2 fluxes and test the accuracy and uncertainty of different statistical models. CO2 fluxes were upscaled at relatively high spatial resolution (1 km(2)) across the high-latitude region using five commonly used statistical models and their ensemble, that is, the median of all five models, using climatic, vegetation, and soil predictors. We found the performance of machine learning and ensemble predictions to outperform traditional regression methods. We also found the predictive performance of NEE-focused models to be low, relative to models predicting GPP and ER. Our data compilation and ensemble predictions showed that CO2 sink strength was larger in the boreal biome (observed and predicted average annual NEE -46 and -29 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively) compared to tundra (average annual NEE +10 and -2 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). This pattern was associated with large spatial variability, reflecting local heterogeneity in soil organic carbon stocks, climate, and vegetation productivity. The terrestrial ecosystem CO2 budget, estimated using the annual NEE ensemble prediction, suggests the high-latitude region was on average an annual CO2 sink during 1990-2015, although uncertainty remains high.

AB Northern hemisphere peatlands play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle, accounting for about 30% of global soil C and similar to 10-25% of global natural methane (CH4) emissions. Satellite remote sensing has the potential for extracting continuous information related to C exchange rates at regional and global extents, yet, few studies have focused on peatlands. In this study we examined the potential of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI and simple ratio, SR), MODIS light use efficiency (LUE) based gross primary production (GPP) and a MODIS derived phenological index (annual peak photosynthetic rate) for the estimation of eddy covariance (EC) flux-derived GPP and net ecosystem production (NEP) at four contrasting northern peatlands. At the four sites of this study MODIS NDVI and SR explained between 39% and 71%, and between 42% and 69% of the variation in EC-derived GPP, respectively; and between 25% and 53%, and between 29% and 39% of the variation in EC-derived NEP, respectively. The relationships were mostly consistent across sites and within sites, suggesting that data may be pooled across years and sites, which could simplify the prediction of gross and net C dioxide (CO2) uptake over large areas dominated by northern peatlands based on MODIS data. MODIS GPP explained between 68% and 89% of the variation in EC-derived GPP at the four study sites. The root mean square errors ranged between 0.62 and 1.16 g C m(-2) d(-1) and were similar to errors from ecosystem process model estimates reported in the literature. Annual peak MODIS GPP, NDVI and SR rates explained up to 50% of the variations in annual cumulative EC-derived GPP and NEP at two of the study sites. Our results show the potentials and limitations of MODIS data to monitor the C dynamics of northern peatlands; among the three studied approaches the MODIS LUE-based GPP approach showed better performance as a predictor of GPP and NEP. The other approaches (VIs and phenology) can provide important input data for LUE models. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands store similar to 20 %-30% of the global soil organic carbon stock and are an important source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for inland waters. Recent improvements for in situ optical monitoring revealed that the DOC concentration in streams draining peatlands is highly variable, showing seasonal variation and short and intense DOC concentration peaks. This study aimed to statistically determine the variables driving stream DOC concentration variations at seasonal and event scales. Two mountainous peatlands (one fen and one bog) were monitored in the French Pyrenees to capture their outlet DOC concentration variability at a high-frequency rate (30 min). Abiotic variables including precipitation, stream temperature and water level, water table depth, and peat water temperature were also monitored at high frequency and used as potential predictors to explain DOC concentration variability. Results show that at both sites DOC concentration time series can be decomposed into a seasonal baseline interrupted by many short and intense peaks of higher concentrations. The DOC concentration baseline is driven, at the seasonal scale, by peat water temperature. At the event scale, DOC concentration increases are mostly driven by a rise in the water table within the peat at both sites. Univariate linear models between DOC concentration and peat water temperature or water table increases show greater efficiency at the fen site. Water recession times were derived from water level time series using master recession curve coefficients. They vary greatly between the two sites but also within one peatland site. They partly explain the differences between DOC dynamics in the studied peatlands, including peat porewater DOC concentrations and the links between stream DOC concentration and water table rise within the peatlands. This highlights that peatland complexes are composed of a mosaic of heterogeneous peat units distinctively producing or transferring DOC to streams.

AB Reliable quantification of the sources and sinks of greenhouse gases, together with trends and uncertainties, is essential to monitoring the progress in mitigating anthropogenic emissions under the Paris Agreement.
   This study provides a consolidated synthesis of CH4 and N2O emissions with consistently derived state-of-the-art bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) data sources for the European Union and UK (EU27 C UK). We integrate recent emission inventory data, ecosystem process-based model results and inverse modeling estimates over the period 1990-2017. BU and TD products are compared with European national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs) reported to the UN climate convention UNFCCC secretariat in 2019. For uncertainties, we used for NGHGIs the standard deviation obtained by varying parameters of inventory calculations, reported by the member states (MSs) following the recommendations of the IPCC Guidelines. For atmospheric inversion models (TD) or other inventory datasets (BU), we defined uncertainties from the spread between different model estimates or model-specific uncertainties when reported. In comparing NGHGIs with other approaches, a key source of bias is the activities included, e.g., anthropogenic versus anthropogenic plus natural fluxes. In inversions, the separation between anthropogenic and natural emissions is sensitive to the geospatial prior distribution of emissions. Over the 2011-2015 period, which is the common denominator of data availability between all sources, the anthropogenic BU approaches are directly comparable, reporting mean emissions of 20.8 TgCH(4) yr (-1) (EDGAR v5.0) and 19.0 TgCH(4) yr(-1) (GAINS), consistent with the NGHGI estimates of 18.9 +/- 1.7 TgCH(4) yr(-1). The estimates of TD total inversions give higher emission estimates, as they also include natural emissions. Over the same period regional TD inversions with higher-resolution atmospheric transport models give a mean emission of 28.8 TgCH(4) yr(-1). Coarser-resolution global TD inversions are consistent with regional TD inversions, for global inversions with GOSAT satellite data (23.3 TgCH(4) yr(-1)) and surface network (24.4 TgCH(4) yr (-1)). The magnitude of natural peatland emissions from the JSBACH-HIMMELI model, natural rivers and lakes emissions, and geological sources together account for the gap between NGHGIs and inversions and account for 5.2 TgCH(4) yr(-1). For N2O emissions, over the 2011-2015 period, both BU approaches (EDGAR v5.0 and GAINS) give a mean value of anthropogenic emissions of 0.8 and 0.9 TgN(2)Oyr(-1), respectively, agreeing with the NGHGI data (0.9 0.6 TgN(2)Oyr(-1)). Over the same period, the average of the three total TD global and regional inversions was 1.3 +/- 0.4 and 1.3 +/- 0.1 TgN(2)Oyr(-1), respectively. The TD and BU comparison method defined in this study can be operationalized for future yearly updates for the calculation of CH4 and N2O budgets both at the EU CUK scale and at the national scale.

AB Northern peatlands are important sources of carbon dioxide and methane emissions to the atmosphere. Increased atmospheric N deposition may have a significant impact on the emission of these greenhouse gases. We studied CO2 and CH4 emissions from untreated temperate pc at soils from a eutrophic and a mesotrophic Fen in a high N deposition area (the Netherlands) and from a mesotrophic fen in a low N deposition area (north-cast Poland). In addition, we investigated the effects of N, P and glucose amendments on the emissions of CO2 and CH4 from these soils.
   Nitrogen availability (extractable NH4+) in untreated pent from the high N area was 2.5-7.5 times higher than in the low N area, whereas the pH was 0.9-1.7 units lower. Using 6-week laboratory incubations of peat columns, we found that mean daily CO2 emission from untreated peat soils from the high N area was lower than that from the low N area. Both linear and multiple regression analysis shelved that CO2 emission was positively related to soil pH (r(2) = 0.64). Additional N supply led to pn reduction and to lower CO2 emission, especially in the low N peat soils. Thus, increased atmospheric N deposition lends, probably as a result of soil acidification, to fewer CO2 emission. Although glucose amendments resulted in increased CO2 and CH4 emission, we did not find evidence that this was caused by increased mineralization of native pest. Mean daily CH4-C emission was about 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than mean daily CO2-C emission. In the untreated peat soils from the high N eutrophic site, methane emission was higher than in the high N mesotrophic site and in the low N mesotrophic site. Linear regression analysis showed a positive relation between methane emission and soil fertility variables (r(2)=0.41-0.55), whereas a multiple regression model revealed that methane emission was determined by N-related soil chemistry variables (r(2) = 0.93). Increased nutrient supply initially resulted in higher methane emission from soils of both mesotrophic sites, but there was no effect on the high N eutrophic soil. These results show that increased atmospheric N deposition leads to increased methane emission from low-fertility pent soils. However, the ultimate effect of atmospheric N deposition on trace gas emissions and thereby on global warming is determined by the balance between the ratios of the change in CO2-C emission and CH4-C emission and the ratio of their global warming potentials (1:21).

AB Climate change will influence plant photosynthesis by altering patterns of temperature and precipitation, including their variability and seasonality. Both effects may be important for peatlands as the carbon (C) sink potential of these ecosystems depends on the balance between plant C uptake through photosynthesis and microbial decomposition. Here, we show that the effect of climate warming on Sphagnum community photosynthesis toggles from positive to negative as the peatland goes from rainy to dry periods during summer. More particularly, we show that mechanisms of compensation among the dominant Sphagnum species (Sphagnum fallax and Sphagnum medium) stabilize the average photosynthesis and productivity of the Sphagnum community during summer despite rising temperatures and frequent droughts. While warming had a negligible effect on S. medium photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) during rainy periods, A(max) of S. fallax increased by 40%. On the opposite, warming exacerbated the negative effects of droughts on S. fallax with an even sharper decrease of its A(max) while S. medium A(max) remained unchanged. S. medium showed a remarkable resistance to droughts due to anatomical traits favouring its water holding capacity. Our results show that different phenotypic plasticity among dominant Sphagnum species allow the community to cope with rising temperatures and repeated droughts, maintaining similar photosynthesis and productivity over summer in warmed and control conditions. These results are important because they provide information on how soil water content may modulate the effects of climate warming on Sphagnum productivity in boreal peatlands. It further confirms the transitory nature of warming-induced photosynthesis benefits in boreal systems and highlights the vulnerability of the ecosystem to excess warming and drying.

AB Peatlands are important sinks of atmospheric carbon (C) that, in response to climate warming, are undergoing dynamic vegetation succession. Here we examined the hypothesis that the uptake of nutrients by different plant growth forms (PGFs) is one key mechanism driving changes in species abundance in peatlands. Along an altitude gradient representing a natural climate experiment, we compared the variability of the stable C isotope composition (delta C-13) and stable nitrogen (N) isotope composition (delta N-15) in current-year leaves of two major PGFs, i.e. ericoids and graminoids. The climate gradient was associated with a gradient of vascular plant cover, which was parallelled by different concentrations of organic and inorganic N as well as the fungal/bacterial ratio in peat. In both PGFs the C-13 natural abundance showed a marginal spatial decrease with altitude and a temporal decrease with progression of the growing season. Our data highlight a primary physical control of foliar delta C-13 signature, which is independent from the PGFs. Natural abundance of foliar N-15 did not show any seasonal pattern and only in the ericoids showed depletion at lower elevation. This decreasing delta N-15 pattern was primarily controlled by the higher relative availability of organic versus inorganic N and, only for the ericoids, by an increased proportion of fungi to bacteria in soil. Our space-for-time approach demonstrates that a change in abundance of PGFs is associated with a different strategy of nutrient acquisition (i.e. transfer via mycorrhizal symbiosis versus direct fine-root uptake), which could likely promote observed and predicted dwarf shrub expansion under climate change.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in rivers contains a wide range of molecules that can be assimilated by microbes. However, there is today no integrated understanding of how the source and composition of this DOC regulate the extent to which the DOC can support microbial growth and respiration. We analyzed patterns in microbial metabolism of DOC from different streams and rivers in Quebec, by combining short-term bacterial production and respiration measurements with long-term DOC loss and analyses of bacterial use of different single substrates. We show that distinct metabolic patterns indeed exist across catchments, reflecting the varying nature and sources of the DOC. For example, DOC from forest headwaters systematically supported the highest bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) that was recorded, while in contrast DOC in peat bog drainage was used with significantly lower BGE. The carbon consumption in clear mountain rivers, possibly represented by autochthonous algal DOC, supported the highest bacterial respiration rates and the highest long-term DOC losses. By using principle component analysis, we demonstrate how the major axes of variation in all of the measured metabolic responses are tightly connected to spectrofluorometrical DOC composition indicators and to isotopic indicators of DOC source. If causality is assumed, our results imply that changes in DOC supply from different sources, for example, caused by land use or climate change, should result in dramatic changes in the patterns of aquatic microbial metabolism and thus in altered aquatic ecosystem functioning, with likely consequences for food-web structures and greenhouse gas balances.

TI Aquatic Microbial Habitats Within a Neotropical Rainforest: Bromeliads

AB Tank-forming bromeliads, suspended in the rainforest canopy, possess foliage arranged in compact rosettes capable of long-term retention of rainwater. This large and unique aquatic habitat is inhabited by microorganisms involved in the important decomposition of impounded material. Moreover, these communities are likely influenced by environmental factors such as pH, oxygen, and light. Bacterial community composition and diversity was determined for the tanks of several bromeliad species (Aechmea and Werauhia) from northern Costa Rica, which span a range of parameters, including tank morphology and pH. These were compared with a nearby forest soil sample, an artificial tank (amber bottle), and a commercially available species (Aechmea). Bacterial community diversity, as measured by 16S rRNA analysis and tRFLP, showed a significant positive correlation with tank pH. A majority of 16S rRNA bacterial phylotypes found in association with acidic bromeliad tanks of pH < 5.1 were affiliated with the Alphaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Bacteroidetes, and were similar to those found in acidic peat bogs, yet distinct from the underlying soil community. In contrast, bromeliads with tank pH > 5.3, including the commercial bromeliad with the highest pH (6.7), were dominated by Betaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. To empirically determine the effect of pH on bacterial community, the tank pH of a specimen of Aechmea was depressed, in the field, from 6.5 to 4.5, for 62 days. The resulting community changed predictably with decreased abundance of Betaproteobacteria and Firmicutes and a concomitant increase in Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria. Collectively, these results suggest that bromeliad tanks provide important habitats for a diverse microbial community, distinct from the surrounding environment, which are influenced greatly by acid-base conditions. Additionally, total organic carbon (similar to 46%) and nitrogen (similar to 2%) of bromeliad-impounded sediment was elevated relative to soil and gene surveys confirmed the presence of both chitinases and nitrogenases, suggesting that bromeliad tanks may provide important habitats for microbes involved in the biological cycling of carbon and nitrogen in tropical forests.

AB The genus Methylocystis belongs to the class Alphaproteobacteria, the family Methylocystaceae, and encompasses aerobic methanotrophic bacteria with the serine pathway of carbon assimilation. All Methylocystis species are able to fix dinitrogen and several members of this genus are also capable of using acetate or ethanol in the absence of methane, which explains their wide distribution in various habitats. One additional trait that enables their survival in the environment is possession of two methane-oxidizing isozymes, the conventional particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) with low-affinity to substrate (pMMO1) and the high-affinity enzyme (pMMO2). Here, we report the finished genome sequence of Methylocystis bryophila S285, a pMMO2-possessing methanotroph from a Sphagnum-dominated wetland, and compare it to the genome of Methylocystis sp. strain SC2, which is the first methanotroph with confirmed high-affinity methane oxidation potential. The complete genome of Methylocystis bryophila S285 consists of a 4.53 Mb chromosome and one plasmid, 175 kb in size. The genome encodes two types of particulate MMO (pMMO1 and pMMO2), soluble MMO and, in addition, contains a pxmABC-like gene cluster similar to that present in some gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs. The full set of genes related to the serine pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle as well as the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway is present. In contrast to most described methanotrophs including Methylocystis sp. strain SC2, two different types of nitrogenases, that is, molybdenum-iron and vanadium-iron types, are encoded in the genome of strain S285. This unique combination of genome-based traits makes Methylocystis bryophila well adapted to the fluctuation of carbon and nitrogen sources in wetlands.

AB This paper presents the development of a new fluorescence imaging technique, for visualization of the complex array of fluorescence spectral data and of progressive petroleum generation. The different rate of fluorescence spectral evolution of marine algal kerogen corresponds with distinct differences in kinetics of petroleum generation. The differential red-shifting of the spectra obtained from different particles in the same sample reflects the differential thermal alteration controlled by the initial distribution of particles with different thermal stability. The particle-specific chemical variabilities are captured by fluorescence spectral data, which are represented as surfaces, containing information regarding relative intensities, wavelengths, and principal component (PCl) projections of the raw spectral data. Continuous functions that describe fluorescence surfaces were derived by polynomial trend surface analysis to define a Fluorescence Imaging Maturity Index (FIMI). FIMI and PGI (Petroleum Generation Index), determined by mass balance calculations of the carbon budget in the natural source rock systems, are used in regression analysis to establish a function for predicting PGI (approximate to transformation ratio). The stacking of fluorescence surfaces according to depth of burial (from a given formation across a basin, or from different formations in the same well), provides 4-dimensional visualization of the dynamics of progressive oil generation.

AB Dissolved natural organic matter (DNOM) is primarily composed of exuded or remnant biomolecules from plants and microorganisms. Labile amino acids and sugars have been well documented in the low molecular weight components of DNOM. However, little attention has been devoted to the isolation of labile short-chain carboxylic acids (SSCAs), which have demonstrated biogeochemical significance as sources of assimilable carbon, promoters of mineral dissolution, and ligands for metal complexation. Here we present an analytical method that identifies compound-specific SSCAs in a peat-derived DNOM isolate, Pahokee peat humic acid. Using high-resolution liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with high-accurate orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS), we targeted the identification of five SSCAs of different types: gluconate (a C-6 monocarboxylic acid), citrate (a branched C-6 tricarboxylic acid), 2-ketoglutarate (a C-5 dicarboxylic acid), and malate and fumarate (C-4 dicarboxylic acids). Following LC-separation and electrospray ionization, the compounds were annotated directly by orbitrap MS using their exact mass-overcharge (m/z) ions in the negative mode and their stoichiometric composition. Validated by LC-MS metabolite annotation in a bacterial matrix, we achieved identification of all five compounds in the peat DNOM isolate. Each targeted m/z channel also captured non-targeted compounds at different retention times, which represent isomers or different compounds. We found that the five targeted and the two non-targeted SSCAs identified collectively accounted for high parts-per-million to low parts-perthous-and of the total carbon, oxygen, or carboxyl content. Building on these findings, an important next step is to obtain a comprehensive profiling of SSCA structures in DNOM of different origins. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands play an important role in global climate change through sequestration of atmospheric CO2. Climatedriven changes in the structure of fungal communities in boreal peatlands that favor saprotrophic fungi can substantially impact carbon dynamics and nutrient cycling in these crucial ecosystems. In a mesocosm study using a full factorial design, 100 intact peat monoliths, complete with living Sphagnum and above-ground vascular vegetation, were subjected to three climate change variables (increased temperature, reduced water table, and elevated CO2 concentrations). Peat litterbags were placed in mesocosms, and fungal communities in litterbags were monitored over 12 months to assess the impacts of climate change variables on peat-inhabiting fungi. Changes in fungal richness, diversity, and community composition were assessed using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of ribosomal DNA (rDNA). While general fungal richness reduced under warming conditions, Ascomycota exhibited higher diversity under increased temperature treatments over the course of the experiment. Both increased temperature and lowered water table position drove shifts in fungal community composition with a strong positive effect on endophytic and mycorrhizal fungi (including one operational taxonomic unit (OTU) tentatively identified as Barrenia panicia) and different groups of saprotrophs identified as Mortierella, Galerina, and Mycena. These shifts were observed during a predicted degradative succession in the decomposer community as different carbon substrates became available. Since fungi play a central role in peatland communities, increased abundances of saprotrophic fungi under warming conditions, at the expense of reduced fungal richness overall, may increase decomposition rates under future climate scenarios and could potentially aggravate the impacts of climate change.

AB Wetlands play a key role in regional and global environments, and are critically linked to major issues such as climate change, wildlife habitat, biodiversity, water quality protection, and global carbon and methane cycles. Remotely-sensed imagery provides a means to detect and monitor wetlands on large scales and with regular frequency. In this project, methodologies were developed to classify wetlands (Open Bog, Treed Bog, Open Fen, Treed Fen, and Swamps) from multi-source remotely sensed data using advanced classification algorithms. The data utilized included multispectral optical and thermal data (Landsat-5) and Radar imagery from RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1. The goals were to determine the best way to combine the aforementioned imagery to classify wetlands, and determine the most significant image features. Classification algorithms investigated in this study were Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). Based on the test results in the study area in Northern Ontario, Canada (49 degrees 31'.34N, 80 degrees 43'37.04W), a RF based classification methodology produced the most accurate classification result (87.51%). SVM, in some cases, produced results of comparable or better accuracy than RF. Our work also showed that the use of surface temperature (an untraditional feature choice) could aid in the classification process if the image is from an abnormally warm spring. This study found that wetlands were best classified using the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetative Index) calculated from optical imagery obtained in the spring months, radar backscatter coefficients, surface temperature, and ancillary data such as surface slope, computed through either an RF or SVM classifier. It was also found that preselection of features using Log-normal or RF variable importance analysis was an effective way of identifying low quality features and to a lesser extent features which were of higher quality.

AB The effect of elevated UV-B radiation on CO2 exchange of a natural flark fen was studied in open-field conditions during 2003-2005. The experimental site was located in SodankylA in northern Finland (67 degrees 22'N, 26 degrees 38'E, 179 m a.s.l.). Altogether 30 study plots, each 120 cm x 120 cm in size, were randomly distributed between three treatments (n=10): ambient control, UV-A control and UV-B treatment. The UV-B-treated plots were exposed to elevated UV-B radiation level for three growing seasons. The instantaneous net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and dark respiration (R-TOT) were measured during the growing season using a closed chamber method. The wintertime CO2 emissions were estimated using a gradient technique by analyzing the CO2 concentration in the snow pack. In addition to the instantaneous CO2 exchange, the seasonal CO2 balances during the growing seasons were modeled using environmental data measured at the site. In general, the instantaneous NEE at light saturation was slightly higher in the UV-B treatment compared with the ambient control, but the gross photosynthesis was unaffected by the exposure. The R-TOT was significantly lower under elevated UV-B in the third study year. The modeled seasonal (June-September) CO2 balance varied between the years depending on the ground water level and temperature conditions. During the driest year, the seasonal CO2 balance was negative (net release of CO2) in the ambient control and the UV-B treatment was CO2 neutral. During the third year, the seasonal CO2 uptake was 43 +/- 36 g CO2-C m(-2) in the ambient control and 79 +/- 45 g CO2-C m(-2) in the UV-B treatment. The results suggest that the long-term exposure to high UV-B radiation levels may slightly increase the CO2 accumulation to fens resulting from a decrease in microbial activity in peat. However, it is unlikely that the predicted development of the level of UV-B radiation would significantly affect the CO2 balance of fen ecosystems in future.

AB Elevated concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) promote browning of lakes, which alters the physicochemical properties of water and ecosystem functioning. However, browning-induced changes in basal production of polyunsaturated fatty acids from the n-3 and n-6 families (n-3 and n-6 PUFA) in lakes are not fully understood. The concentrations of PUFA, which are micronutrients required to maintain growth and reproduction of consumers, have been suggested to either rise or decline in seston as a response to lake browning. Elevated DOC concentrations may also promote bacterial biomass and production and thus potentially increase the concentration of bacterial fatty acids (BAFA) in seston. We analyzed phytoplankton, bacteria and heterotroph biomasses, the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton, and the concentrations and mass fractions of bioseston PUFA, BAFA, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids in ten boreal lakes in eastern Finland, with DOC concentration ranging from 2.8 to 18.7 mg/L. Our results showed that the abundance of PUFA in seston depended on the responses of phytoplankton biomass and community composition to lake browning. Lake browning increased seston PUFA and BAFA concentrations (expressed as mu g/L) but not the contents (expressed as mu g/mg bioseston C). Although low DOC lakes had a favorable phytoplankton community (in terms of PUFA content), the phytoplankton biomass in these oligotrophic lakes was so low that the concentration of PUFA remained low compared to high DOC lakes. The increasing concentration of PUFA in bioseston along the DOC gradient was mainly due to the increasing biomass of nuisance algaGonyostomum semen. However,Gonyostomummay be too large for small-sized zooplankton to ingest, and thus, the trophic transfer of PUFA may be impaired. The trajectories for lake browning and the basal production of PUFA also may depend on the source of carbon and associated nutrient loading; DOC and nutrient loading from agricultural areas may promote cyanobacteria dominance and decrease PUFA availability in lakes, while DOC runoff from more acidic and nutrient-poor peatlands may promoteGonyostomumdominance and increase seston PUFA concentration.

AB Soil type is an important factor defining terrestrial ecosystems and plays a major role for the movement of solutes and cycling of nutrients and carbon. This paper focuses on the effect of peat complex dual-porosity structure on nitrate reduction, with the main objective to show how this process is controlled by pore-scale mass transfer and exchange of nitrate between mobile and immobile pore fractions. A mesocosm experiment was conducted where input solutions of bromide (Br-) and nitrate (NO3 (-)) were continuously supplied downward into 40 cm depth of peat. Br- and NO3 (-) breakthrough curves were used to constrain transport parameters and nitrate reduction rates in the peat depth profile. The vertical distribution of potential nitrate reduction rates were compared with depth distributions of partitioning mobile-immobile pores and the exchange coefficient between the pores. The results showed that an increase of immobile pore fractions with depth increases the common interface surface area between mobile and immobile pores which constitutes to a more pronounced exchange between the two transport domains and enhances the nitrate reduction. Hence, the pore structure with mobile-immobile pore fractions and exchange rate of solutes between mobile and immobile phases play a major role in nitrate reduction in peat soils.

AB Streams draining peatland systems contain a number of different C-species, all of which are linked either directly or indirectly to the cycling of C in the terrestrial environment. Concentrations and fluxes of dissolved, particulate and gaseous forms of carbon were measured along a network of streams draining an acidic peatland catchment (46.3 km(2)) in NE Scotland. The main aim was to identify sources and sinks of all the major forms of C in the drainage network and use this to develop a conceptual understanding of the evolution of streamwater chemistry along a peatland stream continuum. The investigation included a small-scale intra-catchment study of three contiguous sites in a 1.3 km(2) headwater catchment (Brocky Burn) and a larger scale integrated study of seven sites. Mean annual fluxes of the main carbon species varied from 115 - 215 (DOC), 8.15 - 97.0 (POC), 0.32 - 6.90 (HCO3- - C) and 2.62 - 10.4 (free CO2-C) kg C ha(-1) year(-1); all contributed to the overall carbon flux to varying degrees. Methane-C was only measurable at sites within areas of deep peat (< 0.01 - 0.09 kg C ha(-1) year(-1)). Downstream spatial changes in the intra-catchment study (Brocky Burn) were characterised by a decrease in DOC, CO2-C and CH4-C and an increase in POC fluxes over a distance of 1.1 km from the Upper to the Lower sites. In the context of the integrated catchment study estimated losses and gains of carbon from the water column showed no net change in DOC, a large decrease in POC ( - 55%) and a slight increase in HCO3-- C (+7.7%) and CO2-C (+4.5%). A significant decrease in the CO2-C flux: HCO3-C flux ratio with distance downstream from the stream source, illustrates the importance of outgassing of CO2 from streams draining peatland C reservoirs. These data are interpreted in the context of losses and gains of the various components of the aquatic C flux along the peatland stream continuum.

AB 1 Accurate assessment of net primary production is vital for understanding carbon (C) cycling, both regionally and globally. However, this requires effective methods of measurement that acknowledge the unique characteristics of the subject or area being monitored.
   2 Feathermosses dominate the ground layer of boreal upland ecosystems and play a vital role in soil C accumulation, accounting for up to 50% of total photosynthesis. Feathermoss growth is both apical and lateral, with branches of determinate length at maturity produced at consistent frequencies along the stem.
   3 Traditional methods of estimating annual production of feathermosses underestimate total plant production because they do not account for lateral growth of the previous year's immature branches. We present a conceptual model of feathermoss growth using Pleurozium schreberi that includes apical and lateral annual growth. From this model, we provide a modified method to more accurately estimate P. schreberi production. The top 3 cm of 10 P. schreberi plants from each of five bog peatlands in Alberta, Canada, were collected. For each plant, distance from the stem apex to branch insertion, branch length and dry mass, and dry mass of 3-mm stem sections were measured and used to define model parameters that, due to lack of significant variability among the sites, can be applied regionally and possibly globally throughout the boreal zone. An additional 20 plants were collected from a sixth site for testing the accuracy of our modified method.
   4 Assessment of our method showed an insignificant mean difference between observed and calculated production values. Furthermore, comparison of our method with traditional methods showed a c. 25% underestimation of annual production by the latter. Traditional methods underestimate annual biomass production of P. schreberi by c. 73 g m(-2), accounting for more than 14 Tg C year(-1) across the boreal region.
   5 Our study shows that accounting for species-specific growth characteristics when estimating ground layer production has a substantial impact on boreal C budget assessments and therefore the terrestrial C cycle.

AB Methanotrophic bacteria are able to use methane (CH4) as a sole carbon and energy source. Photochemical oxidation of methane takes place in the stratosphere, whereas in the troposphere, this process is carried out by methanotrophic bacteria. On the one hand, it is known that the efficiency of biological CH4 oxidation is dependent on the mode of land use but, on the other hand, the knowledge of this impact on methanotrophic activity (MTA) is still limited. Thus, the aim of the study was to determine the CH4 oxidation ability of methanotrophic bacteria inhabiting selected arable and no-tillage soils from the Lublin region (Albic Luvisol, Brunic Arenosol, Haplic Chernozem, Calcaric Cambisol) and to identify bacteria involved in this process. MTA was determined based on incubation of soils in air with addition of methane at the concentrations of 0.002, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10%. The experiment was conducted in a temperature range of 10-30 degrees C. Methanotrophs in soils were identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS). MTA was confirmed in all investigated soils (in the entire range of the tested methane concentrations and temperatures, except for the arable Albic Luvisol). Importantly, the MTA values in the no-tillage soil were nearly two-fold higher than in the cultivated soils. Statistical analysis indicated a significant influence of land use, type of soil, temperature, and especially methane concentration (p < 0.05) on MTA. Metagenomic analysis confirmed the presence of methanotrophs from the genus Methylocystis (Alphaproteobacteria) in the studied soils (except for the arable Albic Luvisol). Our results also proved the ability of methanotrophic bacteria to oxidize methane although they constituted only up to 0.1% of the total bacterial community.

AB Sphagnum mosses are the key regulating component in peatland ecosystems. Although their importance in sustainability of peatlands and overall impact on the Earth's carbon, nutrient and hydrological balance are well recognised, our knowledge of the effects of enhanced ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation on peat mosses is insufficient. Analogous studies of the subject often bear contrasting results, and the following review represents our effort to untangle this apparent confusion. The review summarises current knowledge of the influence of changing UV-B radiation on morphology, chemistry and physiology of Sphagnum mosses, and discusses the methodological challenges faced by the researchers studying UV-B effects. Solar UV-B radiation regulates growth patterns in peat mosses, thus influencing the environment within the Sphagnum blanket for microorganisms and small invertebrates. Physiological changes, such as the increase in membrane permeability, as well as magnesium,calcium and potassium leakage, and decrease in water-holding capacity are important UV-B responses of Sphagna. UV-B-induced changes in photosynthetic pigments and UV-absorbing compounds of peat mosses are species-specific, and depend on UV radiation dose. The responses seen as a change in the phenolic content are mostly transient and not easily detected.
   The inconsistencies in findings show that the Sphagnum genus should not be considered as a homogeneous group in terms of UV-B responses; instead, comparative research on individual species is required. Therefore, we highlight the necessity for further, more detailed research into Sphagnum responses to UV-B; both as a single driver and in combination with other globally-changing environmental factors.

Conclusions 62 Acknowledgements 62 References 62 Summary Mosses in northern ecosystems are ubiquitous components of plant communities, and strongly influence nutrient, carbon and water cycling. We use literature review, synthesis and model simulations to explore the role of mosses in ecological stability and resilience. Moss community responses to disturbance showed all possible responses (increases, decreases, no change) within most disturbance categories. Simulations from two process-based models suggest that northern ecosystems would need to experience extreme perturbation before mosses were eliminated. But simulations with two other models suggest that loss of moss will reduce soil carbon accumulation primarily by influencing decomposition rates and soil nitrogen availability. It seems clear that mosses need to be incorporated into models as one or more plant functional types, but more empirical work is needed to determine how to best aggregate species. We highlight several issues that have not been adequately explored in moss communities, such as functional redundancy and singularity, relationships between response and effect traits, and parameter vs conceptual uncertainty in models. Mosses play an important role in several ecosystem processes that play out over centuries permafrost formation and thaw, peat accumulation, development of microtopography and there is a need for studies that increase our understanding of slow, long-term dynamical processes.

AB Certain organic carbon moieties in drinking source waters of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta can react with chlorine during disinfection to form potentially carcinogenic and mutagenic trihalomethanes. The properties of reactive organic carbon in Delta waters, particularly those of soil origin, have been poorly understood. This study aftempts to characterize trihalomethane reactivity of soil organic carbon from three representative Delta peat soils. Soil organic carbon was extracted from all three soils with either deionized H(2)O or 0.1. M NaOH and sequentially separated into humic acids, fulvic acids, and nonhumic substances for quantitation of trihalomethane formation potential. Water-extractable organic carbon represented only 0.4 to 0.7% of total sod organic carbon, whereas NaOH extracted 38 to 51% of total soil organic carbon. The sizes and specific trihalomethane formation potential (STHMFP) of individual organic carbon fractions differed with extractants. Fulvic acids were the largest fraction in H(2)O(_) extractable organic carbon, whereas humic acids were the largest fraction in NaOH-extractable organic carbon. Among the fractions derived from H(2)O-extractable carbon, fulvic acids had the greatest specific ultraviolet absorbance and STHMFP and had the majority of reactive organic carbon. Among the fractions from NaOH-extractable organic carbon, humic acids and fulvic acids had similar STHMFP and, thus, were equally reactive. Humic acids were associated with the majority of trihalomethane reactivity of NaOH-extractable organic carbon. The nonhumic substances were less reactive than either humic acids or fulvic acids regardless of extractants. Specific ultraviolet absorbance was not a good predictor of trihalomethane reactivity of organic carbon fractions separated from the soils.

AB Many catchment management schemes in the UK have focussed on peatland restoration to improve ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, water quality and biodiversity. The effect of these schemes on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux is critical in understanding peatland carbon budgets as well as the implications for drinking water treatment. In many catchments, however, peatland areas arc not the only source of DOC, meaning that their significance at the full catchment scale is unclear. In this paper we have evaluated the importance of different land uses as sources of DOC by combining three damsels obtained from the Exe catchment, UK. The first dataset comprises a weekly monitoring record at three sites for six years, the second, a monthly monitoring record of 25 sites in the same catchment for one year, and the third, an assessment of DOC export from litter and soil carbon stocks. Our results suggest that DOC concentration significantly increased from the peaty headwaters to the mixed land-use areas (ANOVA F = 12.52, p < 0.001, df = 2), leading to higher flux estimates at the downstream sites. We present evidence for three possible explanations: firstly, that poor sampling of high flows may lead to underestimation of DOC flux, second, that there are significant sources of DOC besides the peatland head-waters, and finally, that biological- and photo-degradation decreases the influence of upstream DOC sources. Our results provide evidence both for the targeting of catchment management in peatland areas as well as the need to consider DOC from agricultural and forested areas of the catchment.

AB Warming temperatures in continuous permafrost zones of the Arctic will alter both hydrological and geochemical soil conditions, which are strongly linked with heterotrophic microbial carbon (C) cycling. Heterogeneous permafrost landscapes are often dominated by polygonal features formed by expanding ice wedges: water accumulates in low centered polygons (LCPs), and water drains outward to surrounding troughs in high centered polygons (HCPs). These geospatial differences in hydrology cause gradients in biogeochemistry, soil C storage potential, and thermal properties. Presently, data quantifying carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) release from HCP soils are needed to support modeling and evaluation of warming-induced CO2 and CH4 fluxes from tundra soils. This study quantifies the distribution of microbial CO2 and CH4 release in HCPs over a range of temperatures and draws comparisons to previous LCP studies. Arctic tundra soils were initially characterized for geochemical and hydraulic properties. Laboratory incubations at -2, +4, and +8 degrees C were used to quantify temporal trends in CO2 and CH4 production from homogenized active layer organic and mineral soils in HCP centers and troughs, and methanogen abundance was estimated from mcrA gene measurements. Results showed that soil water availability, organic C, and redox conditions influence temporal dynamics and magnitude of gas production from HCP active layer soils during warming. At early incubation times (2-9 days), higher CO2 emissions were observed from HCP trough soils than from HCP center soils, but increased CO2 production occurred in center soils at later times (>20 days). HCP center soils did not support methanogenesis, but CH4-producing trough soils did indicate methanogen presence. Consistent with previous LCP studies, HCP organic soils showed increased CO2 and CH4 production with elevated water content, but HCP trough mineral soils produced more CH4 than LCP mineral soils. HCP mineral soils also released substantial CO2 but did not show a strong trend in CO2 and CH4 release with water content. Knowledge of temporal and spatial variability in microbial C mineralization rates of Arctic soils in response to warming are key to constraining uncertainties in predictive climate models.

AB In order to simulate the warming effects on Arctic wetlands, three passive open-top chambers (OTCs) and three control cage-like structures (CCSs) equipped with soil temperature and soil volumetric water content (VWC) probes for continuous microclimatic measurements were installed in a wet hummock meadow, Petuniabukta, Billefjorden, central Spitsbergen, in 2009. The warming effects on primary productivity were investigated during summer seasons 2009 and 2010 in cyanobacterial colonies of Nostoc commune s.l., which plays an important role in the local carbon and nitrogen cycles. The microclimatic data indicated that the effect of OTCs was dependent on microtopography. During winter, two short-term snow-thaw episodes occurred, so that liquid water was available for the Nostoc communities. Because of the warming, the OTC hummock bases remained unfrozen three weeks longer in comparison to the CCSs and, in spring, the OTC hummock tops and bases exceeded 0 degrees C several days earlier than CCS ones. Mean summer temperature differences were 1.6 degrees C in OTC and CCS hummock tops, and 0.3 degrees C in the OTC and CCS hummock bases. The hummock tops were drier than their bases; however the VWC difference between the OTCs and CCSs was small. Due to the only minor differences in the microclimate of OTC and CCS hummock bases, where the Nostoc colonies were located, no differences in ecophysiological characteristics of Nostoc colonies expressed as photochemistry parameters and nitrogenase activities were detected after two years exposition. Long-term monitoring of Nostoc ecophysiology in a manipulated environment is necessary for understanding their development under climate warming.

AB Northern peatlands store approximately one-third of the World's soil carbon through the long-term accumulation of carbon as peat. However, when peatlands are exploited for Sphagnum moss and horticultural peat, they become degraded and large, persistent sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Recent advances in peatland restoration techniques have succeeded in the re-vegetation of Sphagnum moss on previously cutover surfaces. The long-term success of peatland restoration depends on the development of a sufficiently thick new peat layer that has ecohydrological and hydrophysical properties similar to natural peatlands. We determined these properties for an upper (0-4 cm) and lower (8-12 cm) peat layer in a recently restored peatland, a naturally re-vegetated cutover peatland, and a natural peatland in eastern Quebec. The properties of the new peat layer differed significantly between the sites, especially for the lower layer samples. Lower samples for the natural and naturally re-vegetated sites had a bulk density of 43 +/- 5 and 41 +/- 11 kg m(-3), respectively, almost twice as high as the value for lower samples from the restored site (24 +/- 4 kg m(-3)). Sphagnum rubellum capitula density (rho(c)) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) for the restored peatland (28 726 # m(-2)) compared to the natural site (26 050 # m(-2)). Residual moisture content at a soil water pressure of -200 tub (theta(r)) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) for the restored site in comparison to the natural and naturally re-vegetated sites for the lower samples. This suggests that S. rubellum in a natural peatland is able to hold onto more moisture under increasing soil tension than the same species growing in a restored site likely due to its higher bulk density and relatively more decomposed state. We suggest that it is possible that S. rubellum growing in the harsher cutover peatland environment has possibly allocated more carbohydrates to vertical growth and as a consequence has a lower bulk density and poorer water retention.

AB Current emissions inventories of black carbon aerosol, an important component of PM2.5 and a powerful climate altering species, are highly uncertain in both space and time. One of the major and hardest to constrain sources of black carbon is fire, which comes from a combination of forest, vegetation, agricultural, and peat sources. Therefore, quantifying this source more precisely in both space and time is essential. While there is a growing body of work on this topic, the best estimations generally underestimate measurements by integer factors. In this work, 12 years of measurements from 2000 through 2012 of AOD from the MISR satellite and AOD and AAOD from the AERONET network, are used to evaluate the aerosol climatology from Southeast Asian fires. First, the fires in Southeast Asia are uniquely characterized in both space and time to reveal two major burning regions: one with a regular inter-annual and intra-annual distribution, and the other with an irregular inter-annual and somewhat variable intra-annual distribution. These patterns correspond well with regional and local measurements of both composition and meteorology. Using these newly developed relationships, a new temporally and spatially varying set of black carbon emissions is developed. Finally, the best fits with the various measurements yield an annual average value for black carbon emissions due to fires bounded by the range 0.36-0.54 Tg yr(-1), with the amount in the year of the greatest fires being bounded by the range 1.2-1.8 Tg yr(-1). These magnitudes are significantly higher and differently distributed in space and time when compared with current inventories, and therefore are expected to have a significant impact on regional particulate loadings and the global climate system.

AB Northern peatlands have accumulated large carbon (C) stocks, acting as a long-term atmospheric C sink since the last deglaciation. How these C-rich ecosystems will respond to future climate change, however, is still poorly understood. Furthermore, many northern peatlands exist in regions underlain by permafrost, adding to the challenge of projecting C balance under changing climate and permafrost dynamics. In this study, we used a paleoecological approach to examine the effect of past climates and local disturbances on vegetation and C accumulation at a peatland complex on the southern Seward Peninsula, Alaska over the past similar to 15 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP). We analyzed two cores about 30 m apart, NL10-1 (from a permafrost peat plateau) and NL10-2 (from an adjacent thermokarst collapse-scar bog), for peat organic matter (OM), C accumulation rates, macrofossil, pollen and grain size analysis.
   A wet rich fen occurred during the initial stages of peatland development at the thermokarst site (NL10-2). The presence of tree pollen from Picea spp. and Larix laricinia at 13.5-12.1 ka indicates a warm regional climate, corresponding with the well-documented Bolling-Allerod warm period. A cold and dry climate interval at 12.1-11.1 ka is indicated by the disappearance of tree pollen and increase in Poaceae pollen and an increase in woody material, likely representing a local expression of the Younger Dryas (YD) event. Following the YD, the warm Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) is characterized by the presence of Populus pollen, while the presence of Sphagnum spp. and increased C accumulation rates suggest high peatland productivity under a warm climate. Toward the end of the HTM and throughout the mid-Holocene a wet climate-induced several major flooding disturbance events at 10 ka, 8.1 ka, 6 ka, 5.4 ka and 4.7 ka, as evidenced by decreases in OM, and increases in coarse sand abundance and aquatic fossils (algae Chara and water fleas Daphnia). The initial peatland at permafrost site (NL10-1) is characterized by rapid C accumulation (66 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), high OM content and a peak in Sphagnum spp. at 5.8-4.6 ka, suggesting the lack of permafrost. A transition to extremely low C accumulation rates of 6.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) after 4.5 ka at this site suggests the onset of permafrost aggradation, likely in response to Neoglacial climate cooling as documented across the circum-Arctic region. A similar decrease in C accumulation rates also occurred at non-permafrost site NL10-2. Time-weighted C accumulation rates are 21.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for core NL10-1 during the last similar to 6.5 ka and 14.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for core NL10-2 during the last similar to 15 ka. Evidence from peat-core analysis and historical aerial photographs shows an abrupt increase in Sphagnum spp. and decrease in area of thermokarst lakes over the last century, suggesting major changes in hydrology and ecosystem structure, likely due to recent climate warming.
   Our results show that the thermokarst-permafrost complex was much more dynamic with high C accumulation rates under warmer climates in the past, while permafrost was stabilized and C accumulation slowed down following the Neoglacial cooling in the late Holocene. Furthermore, permafrost presence at local scales is controlled by both regional climate and site-specific factors, highlighting the challenge in projecting responses of permafrost peatlands and their C dynamics to future climate change.

AB Acidobacteria are one of the widespread and numerically abundant groups of prokaryotes in soils and peatlands. The functional potential of these microorganisms remains poorly understood due to the limited number of cultured and characterized representatives.Acidisarcina polymorphaSBC82 is the only acidobacterium for which the ability to use chitin as a source of nitrogen and carbon has been experimentally proven. The genome of strain SBC82 encodes six proteins from the GH18 glycoside hydrolase family; each of these proteins can be considered as a representative of an independent subfamily. The present bioinformatics study shows that one of these subfamilies contains an extensive group of hypothetical chitinases from theAcidobacteria. This functional annotation was done based on the close relationship with the experimentally characterized enzyme from the proteobacteriumXylella fastidiosa. As shown by phylogenetic analysis, the studied group of acidobacterial proteins originated due to lateral transfer of the ancestral gene from theFirmicutes. Acidobacteria subsequently served as a source for multiple lateral gene transfers to a number of bacterial phyla, including theProteobacteria. Analysis of metagenomic datasets revealed a wide distribution of chitinase genes in acidobacteria that inhabit wetlands and permafrost soils of the temperate and subarctic climatic zones.

AB Remote sensing of near-surface hydrological conditions within northern peatlands has the potential to provide important large-scale hydrological information regarding ecological and carbon-balance processes occurring within such systems. This article details how field knowledge of the spectral properties of Sphagnum spp., airborne remote sensing data and a range of image analysis approaches, may be combined to provide a suitable proxy for near-surface wetness. Co-incident field and airborne remote sensing data were acquired in May and September 2002 over an important UK raised bog (Cors Fochno). A combination of laboratory-tested NIR and SWIR water-based and biophysical spectral reflectance indices were applied to field and airborne reflectance spectra of Sphagnum pulchrum to elucidate changes in near-surface moisture conditions. Field results showed significant correlations between water-based indices (moisture stress index (MSI) and floating water band indices (fWBI(980) and fWBI(1200)))) and measures of both near-surface volumetric moisture content (VMC) and water-table position. Spectral indices formulated from the NIR (fWBI(980) and fWBI(1200)) proved to be the most useful for indicating near-surface wetness across the widest range of moisture conditions because of their ability to penetrate deeper into the Sphagnum canopy. Correlations between a biophysical index based upon chlorophyll content and both hydrological measures were not significant, possibly due to relatively high levels of surface wetness at the field site in both May and September. S. pulchrum lawns were successfully located and mapped from airborne imagery using the mixed tuned match filtering (MTMF) algorithm. Importantly, MSI derived from airborne data was significantly correlated with both field moisture and the water-table position. Relationships between measures of near-surface wetness and the MSI for naturally heterogeneous canopies were, however, found to be weaker for airborne imagery than for associated field data. This is likely to be a result of the formulation of the MSI itself and the possible preferential detection of "wetter" pixels within the imagery. This effectively reduced the ability of MSI to detect subtle changes in near-surface wetness under high moisture conditions, but would not impede the use of the index under drier conditions. Results from the field data suggest that indices formulated from the NIR may be more suitable for detailed estimations of near-surface and surface wetness at the landscape-scale although reliable hyperspectral data are required to test fully the performance of such indices. The relative merits of using such an approach to determine near-surface hydrological conditions across entire peatland complexes are also discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB [1] Hydraulic head was overpressured at middepth in a 4.2-m thick raised bog in the Glacial Lake Agassiz peatlands of northern Minnesota, and fluctuated in response to atmospheric pressure. Barometric efficiency (BE), determined by calculating ratios of change in hydraulic head to change in atmospheric pressure, ranged from 0.05 to 0.15 during July through November of both 1997 and 1998. The overpressuring and a BE response were caused by free-phase gas contained primarily in the center of the peat column between two or more semielastic, semiconfining layers of more competent peat. Two methods were used to determine the volume of gas bubbles contained in the peat, one using the degree of overpressuring in the middepth of the peat, and the other relating BE to specific yield of the shallow peat. The volume of gas calculated from the overpressuring method averaged 9%, assuming that the gas was distributed over a 2-m thick overpressured interval. The volume of gas using the BE method averaged 13%. Temporal changes in overpressuring and in BE indicate that the volume of gaseous-phase gas also changed with time, most likely because of rapid degassing (ebullition) that allowed sudden loss of gas to the atmosphere. Estimates of gas released during the largest ebullition events ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 mol m(-2) d(-1). These ebullition events may contribute a significant source of methane and carbon dioxide to the atmosphere that has so far largely gone unmeasured by gas-flux chambers or tower-mounted sensors.

AB The net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) drives the carbon (C) sink-source strength of northern peatlands. Since NEE represents a balance between various production and respiration fluxes, accurate predictions of its response to global changes require an in depth understanding of these underlying processes. Currently, however, detailed information of the temporal dynamics as well as the separate biotic and abiotic controls of the NEE component fluxes is lacking in peatland ecosystems. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by using an automated chamber system established across natural and trenching/vegetation removal plots to partition NEE into its production (i.e., gross and net primary production; GPP and NPP) and respiration (i.e., ecosystem, heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration; ER, Rh and Ra) fluxes in a boreal peatland in northern Sweden. Our results showed that daily NEE patterns were driven by GPP while variations in ER were governed by Ra rather than Rh. Moreover, we observed pronounced seasonal shifts in the Ra/Rh and above/belowground NPP ratios throughout the main phenological phases. Generalized linear model analysis revealed that the greenness index derived from digital images (as a proxy for plant phenology) was the strongest control of NEE, GPP and NPP while explaining considerable fractions also in the variations of ER and Ra. In addition, our data exposed greater temperature sensitivity of NPP compared to Rh resulting in enhanced C sequestration with increasing temperature. Overall, our study suggests that the temporal patterns in NEE and its component fluxes are tightly coupled to vegetation dynamics in boreal peatlands and thus challenges previous studies that commonly identify abiotic factors as key drivers. These findings further emphasize the need for integrating detailed information on plant phenology into process-based models to improve predictions of global change impacts on the peatland C cycle.

AB Warming of the permafrost accompanied by the release of ancient soil organic carbon is one of the most significant environmental threats within the global climate change scenario. While the main sites of permafrost carbon processing and its release to the atmosphere are thermokarst (thaw) lakes and ponds, the main carriers of carbon and related major and trace elements from the land to the Arctic ocean are Russian subarctic rivers. The source of carbon in these rivers is atmospheric C consumed by chemical weathering of rocks and amplified by plant uptake and litter decomposition. This multidisciplinary study describes results of more than a decade of observations and measurements of elements fluxes, stocks and mechanisms in the Russian boreal and subarctic zone, from Karelia region to the Kamchatka peninsula, along the gradient of permafrost-free terrain to continuous permafrost settings, developed on various lithology and vegetation types. We offer a comprehensive, geochemically-based view on the functioning of aquatic boreal systems which quantifies the role of the following factors on riverine element fluxes: (1) the specificity of lithological substrate; (2) the importance of organic and organo-mineral colloidal forms, notably during the snowmelt season; (3) the phenomenon of lakes seasonal overturn; (4) the role of permafrost within the small and large watersheds; and (5) the governing role of terrestrial vegetation in element mobilization from rock substrate to the river. Care of such a multiple approach, a first order prediction of the evolution of element stocks and fluxes under scenario of progressive warming in high latitudes becomes possible. It follows the increase of frozen peat thawing in western Siberia will increase the stocks of elements in surface waters by a factor of 3 to 10 whereas the increase of the thickness of active layer, the biomass and the primary productivity all over permafrost-affected zone will bring about a short-term increase of elements stocks in labile reservoir (plant litter) and riverine fluxes by a factor of 2. The change of the plant productivity and community composition under climate warming in central Siberia will be the most important factor of major and trace element fluxes increase (probably a factor of 2) from the soil to the river and, finally, to the Arctic Ocean.

TI AGE analysis of the impact of a carbon energy tax on the Irish economy
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS

DT Article
DE applied general equilibrium; climate change; energy taxes; Ireland
ID EMISSIONS; MODELS; POLICY
AB A computable general equilibrium model with specific detail in taxation and energy use is developed in this paper to quantify the impact of the implementation of energy taxation to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Ireland. Benchmark data combining physical energy and emissions data and economic data in the form of a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) had to be compiled from various data sources, because energy and pollution accounts from the SEEA are not available for Ireland. We find that the reduction target for energy related CO2 emissions in Ireland of 25.8% compared to 1998 levels can be achieved with a carbon energy tax of 10-15 euros per tonne of CO2. Though fuel switching is important in meeting the target, this result is more sensitive to the possibilities for producers to substitute away from energy use. Welfare would fall but only by small percentages. Production and consumption patterns would change more significantly, with a shift in demand from fuels with a high emission factor to energy sources with a lower carbon-intensity and from energy to other commodities. This paper confirms that a carbon energy tax leads to greater emission reductions than an equivalent uniform energy tax. The latter has a stronger negative impact on the less polluting energy sectors whereas the carbon tax greatly stimulates the use of renewable energy and reduces the use of peat and coal. The new SAM, the model and the application to energy taxes contribute to a better informed debate on environmental policy in Ireland. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Methane fluxes were measured in an area of ombrotrophic mire at the Migneint in North Wales. Measurements were made at approximately monthly intervals between August 1993 and August 1995. A marked seasonal change in emission rates was noted. Peaks of methane emission were observed in August 1993 (6.2 mg m(-2) d(-1)), September 1994 (6.0 mg m(-2) d(-1)) and June 1995 (5.5 mg m(-2) d(-1)). Minimum emission rates were recorded in March 1994 (0.8 mg m(-2) d(-1)) and March 1995 (1.4 mg m(-2) d(-1)). Nitrogen, in the form of ammonium and/or nitrate, was applied to plots on the mire surface. Between August 1993 and July 1994 application rates were equivalent to a 50 or 100% increase in N deposition. From August 1994 to August 1995 the application rates were equivalent to a 500 or 1000% increase in N deposition. These applications of nitrogen had no effect on the methane emission rates at any date, with the exception of the measurement from November 1994. No correlation was found between methane flux and either soil temperature or water table. We suggest that the state of the vegetation at the site may be important, either through the role of the plants in transport of methane, or as the source of the organic carbon that is the substrate for methanogenesis.

AB Peatland is a key component of terrestrial ecosystems in permafrost regions and have important effects on climate warming. Soil enzymes are involved in biogeochemical cycle of soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), which can be used as early sensitive indicators of soil nutrient changes caused by climate change. To predict the possible effects of permafrost degradation on soil enzymes in peatlands, ten peatlands from three types of permafrost regions along the permafrost degradation sequence (predominantly continuous permafrost region-predominantly continuous and island permafrost region-sparsely island permafrost region) in northeast China were selected to examine the activities of soil invertase, beta-glucosidase, urease and acid phosphatase and their relationships with soil physicochemical properties. The results demonstrated that permafrost type had significant effect on soil enzyme activities. Soil enzyme activities in predominantly continuous and island permafrost region were significantly higher than those in sparsely island permafrost region and predominantly continuous permafrost region. The activities of four soil enzymes were higher in 0-15 cm than 15-30 cm soil layer. Soil enzymes activities were positively correlated with soil ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), soil moisture content (SMC), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN), but negatively correlated with soil nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N). Soil inorganic nitrogen and moisture contents were the main factors affecting soil enzyme activities, with NH4+-N accounted for 41.6% of the variance, SMC 29.6%, and NO3--N 11.0%. These results suggested that permafrost degradation may change soil enzyme activities by changing soil physicochemical properties. In this study, only 0-30 cm peat soil in permafrost regions was collected during the complete thawing period of permafrost active layer, further studies should be placed on the change of soil enzyme activities in active layer and permafrost layer during freezing and thawing process in the southernmost location of northeast China in the Eurasia permafrost body and boreal forest belt.

AB Over the last decades, Arctic landscapes have experienced intense warming leading to permafrost degradation and rapid ecosystem changes. Active layer thickening, widespread melting of ground ice and thermo-erosion have affected the mobilization of organic and mineral elements. While the carbon and nitrogen cycles are intensively studied, the soil weathering has been less documented. In the present study, we monitored the chemistry of soil capillary and gravitational pore waters, rainfall and stream waters daily during the growing season in two experimental sites under tussock tundra vegetation in the low-Arctic region, in Salluit (Nunavik, Canada). We aimed to investigate the seasonal thaw controls on the evolution of concentrations of major organic and inorganic elements in the active layer (i.e., seasonally thawed surface layers) of two permafrost soils (Cryosols) differing in parental materials: an ombrotrophic bog (i.e., Histic Cryosol) and post-glacial marine sediments continuously waterlogged (i.e., Turbic Cryosol). In the Histic Cryosol, the electrical conductivity was <100 mu S cm(-1) and Cl- and Na+ were the dominant soluble ions originating from atmospheric depositions. In the Turbic Cryosol, decarbonated in the first 40 cm, Ca2+ and Mg2+ were the dominant soluble ions in the capillary water reflecting the dissolution of soil minerals, while Cl- and SO42- dominated in gravitational water, illustrating inputs from uphill. In the two soils, Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations as well as Mg/Na and Ca/Na increased with depth. Along summer, the soil pore water chemistry evolved with thaw front and water table depths in the two sites. Particularly in the Histic Cryosol, electrical conductivity, solute concentrations, Mg/Na and Ca/Na ratios increased with the thaw front deepening. Our observations suggest that the active layer thickening and increasing supra-permafrost flow contribution, expected to increase with Arctic warming, could lead to a shift in chemistry of pore waters in organic and mineral permafrost soils, differently depending on permafrost landform settings.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands are significantly promoted by global nitrogen input for changing the rate of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, and are substantially affected by soil labile carbon and nitrogen conversely. However, the driving mechanism by which soil labile carbon and nitrogen affect greenhouse gas emissions from wetland ecosystems under global nitrogen input is not well understood. Working out the driving factor of nitrogen input on greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands is critical to reducing global warming from nitrogen input. Thus, we synthesized 72 published studies (2144 paired observations) of greenhouse gas fluxes and soil labile compounds of carbon and nitrogen (ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, soil microbial biomass nitrogen and carbon), to understand the effects of labile carbon and nitrogen on greenhouse gas emissions under global nitrogen input. Across the data set, nitrogen input significantly promoted carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from wetlands. In particular, at lower nitrogen rates (<100 kg ha(-1).yr(-1)) and with added ammonium compounds, freshwater wetland significantly promoted carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Peatland was the largest nitrous oxide source under these conditions. This meta-analysis also revealed that nitrogen input stimulated dissolved organic carbon, ammonium, nitrate, microbial biomass carbon and microbial biomass nitrogen accumulation in the wetland ecosystem. The variation-partitioning analysis and structural equation model were used to analyze the relationship between the greenhouse gas and labile carbon and nitrogen further. These results revealed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the primary factor driving greenhouse gas emission from wetlands under global nitrogen input, whereas microbial biomass carbon (MBC) more directly affects greenhouse gas emission than other labile carbon and nitrogen.

AB Rewetting Rewetting can promote the ecological recovery of disturbed peatland ecosystems and may help to revert these ecosystems to carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks. However, rewetting of disturbed peatlands can also cause substantial emissions of methane (CH4) and possibly nitrous oxide (N2O). This study quantified summertime emissions of the three major long-lived greenhouse gases (GHGs) CO2, CH4 and N2O; from undisturbed, disturbed and rewetted soils in the Burns Bog Ecological Conservancy Area (BBECA), a 20 km(2) urban bog located in Delta, British Columbia, Canada. Four sites were chosen that represent different stages before or after ecological recovery in the BBECA: (i) a relatively undisturbed scrub pine / Sphagnum / low shrub ecosystem; (ii) a Rhynchospora alba / Sphagnum ecosystem that was disturbed by peat mining more than 65 years ago; (iii) a R. alba / Dulichium arundinaceum ecosystem that was disturbed by peat mining 50 years ago and rewetted five years ago; and (iv) a disturbed and rewetted surface with little vegetation cover that was cleared of vegetation 16 years ago and rewetted two years ago. The GHG fluxes from soils and ground vegetation were measured at all sites during June-August 2014, using a portable non-steady-state chamber system for CO2 and syringe sampling and laboratory analysis for CH4 and N2O fluxes. All four sites exhibited net GHG emissions into the atmosphere, dominated by CH4, which contributed 81-98 % of net CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions. Overall, the median CH4 flux for all measurements and sites was similar to 74 mg m(-2) day(-1) (similar to 30-410 mg m(-2) day(-1), 25th-75th percentiles). Fluxes in the rewetted (water-saturated) sedge ecosystem were highest, with a quarter of the values higher than 3,000 mg m(-2) day(-1) (median 78 mg m(-2) day(-1)). Exchange of CO2 due to photosynthesis and respiration was of secondary importance compared to soil CH4 emissions. Continuous CO2 flux measurements using the eddy covariance approach in the disturbed and rewetted R. alba / Sphagnum site showed that the entire ecosystem, which included tall vegetation, was a weak CO2 sink during the summer (average summertime CO2 uptake of 3.59 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)). No significant emission or uptake of N2O was observed. The results showed that CH4 emissions dominated the net GHG emissions in this disturbed bog at different stages of recovery.

AB Shifts in temperature and rainfall regimes with climate change can feed back on redox dynamics and associated biogeochemical cycling in humid environments. This has global implications for greenhouse gas emissions and ecosystem carbon (C) storage and loss. Though aerobic carbon dioxide (CO2) production is generally understood to follow an Arrhenius-type temperature dependence, the temperature sensitivity of anaerobic metabolisms such as iron (Fe) reduction and methane (CH4) fluxes, both processes affecting C cycling in soils, remains unclear in upland soils. We used a fully factorial incubation experiment to examine the interactive effects of temperature (8, 26, and 35 degrees C) and redox (oxic and anoxic) conditions on CO2 production, CH4 fluxes, Fe reduction, microbial biomass C, and the microbial metabolic quotient (MMQ) in upland soils from two contrasting climate regimes and redox environments: a tropical forest in Puerto Rico (PR) and a temperate peatland in California (CA). Under oxic conditions, we found that CO2 production increased across both temperature gradients (8-26 degrees C and 26-35 degrees C). In contrast, under anoxic conditions, net CH4 fluxes and Fe reduction exhibited a greater temperature sensitivity between 26 and 35 degrees C than 8-26 degrees C in both PR and CA soils. We also observed coupling between Fe reduction and net CH4 fluxes in PR and CA soils consistent with competition for acetate. The anoxic MMQ increased in PR soils at high temperature, but not in CA soils, suggesting that the native PR environment may favor the development of more efficient microbial communities better able to tolerate warmer, wetter conditions. Together, our results suggest that anaerobic microbial metabolisms may be much more sensitive to higher temperature than aerobic ones, possibly due to proportionally greater anaerobic microbial activity at high temperature. Our results suggest that increased global temperatures combined with higher rainfall regimes may significantly increase anaerobic greenhouse gas production in humid environments.

AB Although wetland soils represent a relatively small portion of the terrestrial landscape, they account for an estimated 20 %-30 % of the global soil carbon (C) reservoir. C stored in wetland soils that experience seasonal flooding is likely the most vulnerable to increased severity and duration of droughts in response to climate change. Redox conditions, plant root dynamics, and the abundance of protective mineral phases are well-established controls on soil C persistence, but their relative influence in seasonally flooded mineral soils is largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed the relative importance of environmental (temperature, soil moisture, and redox potential) and biogeochemical (mineral composition and root biomass) factors in controlling CO2 efflux, C quantity, and organic matter composition along replicated upland-lowland transitions in seasonally flooded mineral soils. Specifically, we contrasted mineral soils under temperature deciduous forests in lowland positions that undergo seasonal flooding with adjacent upland soils that do not, considering both surface (A) and subsurface (B and C) horizons. We found the lowland soils had lower total annual CO2 efflux than the upland soils, with monthly CO2 efflux in lowlands most strongly correlated with redox potential (E-h). Lower CO2 efflux as compared to the uplands corresponded to greater C content and abundance of lignin-rich, higher-molecular-weight, chemically reduced organic compounds in the lowland surface soils (A horizons). In contrast, subsurface soils in the lowland position (C-g horizons) showed lower C content than the upland positions (C horizons), coinciding with lower abundance of root biomass and oxalate-extractable Fe (Fe-o, a proxy for protective Fe phases). Our linear mixed-effects model showed that Fe-o served as the strongest measured predictor of C content in up- land soils, yet Fe-o had no predictive power in lowland soils. Instead, our model showed that Eh and oxalate-extractable Al (Al-o, a proxy of protective Al phases) became significantly stronger predictors in the lowland soils. Combined, our results suggest that low redox potentials are the primary cause for C accumulation in seasonally flooded surface soils, likely due to selective preservation of organic compounds under anaerobic conditions. In seasonally flooded subsurface soils, however, C accumulation is limited due to lower C inputs through root biomass and the removal of reactive Fe phases under reducing conditions. Our findings demonstrate that C accrual in seasonally flooded mineral soil is primarily due to low redox potential in the surface soil and that the lack of protective metal phases leaves these C stocks highly vulnerable to climate change.

AB It has been shown in many habitats worldwide, that a shift in vegetation composition between woody shrub and graminoid dominance can influence carbon (C) cycling. Due to land management practices and environmental change, UK upland heath vegetation has historically undergone shifts in dominance from the woody dwarf shrub Calluna vulgaris (Calluna) to species poor graminoid swards. The consequences of this for C sequestration are unknown.
   We compared annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) between building phase Callunaand grass-dominated communities Within three upland heaths in Scotland, measuring c. monthly over a year. Light and temperature response curves were generated, and the parameters derived were applied to continuous light and temperature data to extrapolate CO2 fluxes over the full year and generate estimates of annual CO2 sequestration for each vegetation type.
   Grass-dominated communities had higher ecosystem respiration rates than Calluna-dominated communities, attributed to graminoids having greater metabolic demands and producing more labile litter which decomposes readily. Both communities had similar gross primary productivity over the year; the net result being higher NEE within the Calluna-dominated than the grass-dominated community (-2.36 +/- 0.23 and -1.78 +/- 0.18 mu mol CO2 m(-2) S-1 respectively).
   Modelled CO2 fluxes over a year showed both communities to be CO2 sinks. The Calluna-dominated community sequesters -3.45 +/- 0.96 t C ha(-1) yr(-1), double that sequestered by the grass-dominated community at 1.61 +/- 0.57 t C ha(-1) yr(-1).
   Potential rate of C sequestration by upland heath is comparable to that of woodland and the increase in total sequestration that could be gained from habitat restoration may equate to c. 60% of the annual UK C sink attributed to forest land management. National C sequestration by heathlands is also more than double that by peatlands. Management of graminoid-dominated upland heath should promote Calluna re-establishment, thus providing a C benefit in addition to benefits to biodiversity, grazing and sporting interests.

AB In order to improve soil quality, reduce wastes and mitigate climate change, it is necessary to understand the balance between soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and depletion under different organic waste compost amended soils. The effects of proportion (5%, 15%, 30%), compost type (sewage sludge (SS), tomato stem waste (TSW), municipal solid waste (MSW), kitchen waste (KW), cabbage waste (CW), peat (P), chicken manure (CM), dairy cattle manure (DCM)) and the black soil (CK). Their initial biochemical composition (carbon, nitrogen, C:N ratio) on carbon (C) mineralization in soil amended compost have been investigated. The CO2-C production of different treatments were measured to indicate the levels of carbon (C) mineralization during 50 d of laboratory incubation. And the one order E model (MIE) was used to quantify C mineralization kinetics. The results demonstrated that the respiration and C mineralization of soil were promoted by amending composts. The C mineralization ability increased when the percentage of compost added to the soil also increased and affected by compost type in the order CM > KW, ON> SS, DCM, TSW > MSW, P > CK at the same amended level. Based on the values of Co and k1 from MlE model, a management method in agronomic application of compost products to the precise fertilization was proposed. The SS, DCM and TSW composts were more suitable in supplying fertilizer to the plant. Otherwise, The P and MSW composts can serve the purpose of long-term nutrient retention, whereas the CW and KW composts could be used as soil remediation agent. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB PurposeThe study of interactions between humic substances (HSs) and soil filamentous fungi is the key to understanding the sustainable soil functioning. The present work aims to examine the decomposition of HSs by filamentous dark-pigmented fungus Alternaria alternata under the laboratory conditions and to determine the effect of easily assimilable organic carbon on this process. Analyzing such polydisperse substances like HSs by a complex integrated methodology makes it possible to explore the data on their decomposition by microorganisms.Materials and methodsTo achieve the aforementioned goals, we used chromatographic and spectroscopic approaches: low-pressure size-exclusion and hydrophobic interaction chromatography accompanied by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. To determine the effect cometabolism conditions produced on HS decomposition, two types of carbon substrates were added to the nutrient media: easily assimilable organic carbon (standard 0.3% or reduced 0.03% sucrose content) and hardly assimilable organic carbon (HSs), as well as their combinations. Five HS samples of different organic matter origin have been inspected: potassium humates (HPs) and humic acids (HAs) from coal, peat, and lignosulfonate. Correlation matrix and principal component analysis (PCA) were calculated for comprehensive data analysis.Results and discussionTransformations of the investigated HSs under fungal cultivation lead to the increase in the low molecular weight fraction, rise of hydrophilic fraction, enlargement of absorbance ratio A(250)/A(365), shortening of the emission wavelength of the humic-type fluorescence, and growth in the fluorescence quantum yield measured with excitation at 355nm. A positive correlation was observed between the accumulation of fungal biomass and the degree of HS decomposition. PCA analysis confirms that the difference in the results of HS decomposition largely depends on the sucrose content and the nature of HSs. We divided all the HS samples into four groups according to the degree of HS decomposition: original HS solutions, HPs altered using fungal cultivation at 0.03% sucrose, HAs after fungal cultivation at 0.03% sucrose, and finally, HSs (both HPs and HAs) after fungal cultivation at 0.3% sucrose.ConclusionsIn the laboratory experiments, we showed that (1) the isolated HAs were more effectively degraded than the parent HPs, and this process was more pronounced at a reduced sucrose content, and (2) the decomposition of stable organic compounds (HSs) was activated by the easily assimilable carbon sources (especially 0.3% sucrose) being present. We assume that it is the easily assimilable organic carbon that most likely triggers the HS degradation working as the priming effect in natural environments.

AB Riverine fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) were estimated at 23 sites on two major river systems in NE Scotland, from fortnightly measurements of concentration and flow. The annual flux of DOC and POC increased cumulatively downstream in both the R. Dee and the R. Don. At the lowest, non-tidal site the estimated annual DOC export (95% confidence limits) was 4.1 (+/-2.1) x 10(6) kg per year for the R. Dee and 2.3 (+/-1.3) x 10(6) kg per year for the R. Don. POC exports in the two rivers comprised about 10% of the total organic carbon flux in the R. Dee at 0.3 (+/-0.2) x 10(6) kg per year and 25% in the R. Don at 0.7 (+/-0.5) x 10(6) kg per year. When expressed on a unit area basis, DOC flux estimates were approximately 20 kg ha(-1) per year and POC exports were approximately 1-5 kg ha(-1) per year at main stem sites on both rivers, However, there were considerable variations in fluxes between tributary and headwater sites on the R. Dee. DOC exports ranged from 13.2 to 115.0 kg ha(-1) per year and POC exports were between 6.0 and 85.3 kg ha(-1) per year. In a sample of 11 R. Dee sub-catchments, annual fluxes of DOC and POC both showed a strong positive correlation with the cover of hill peat in the catchment area, which indicates that areas of hill peat are a major source of organic carbon to the river. In the lower parts of the R. Dee and R. Don catchments, POC export rates during non-storm how conditions also appeared to be related to the extent of arable land in the catchment.

AB Soil gas production processes, mainly anaerobic or aerobic soil respiration, drive major gas fluxes across the soil-atmosphere interface. Carbon dioxide (CO2) effluxes, an efflux which in most ecosystems is a result of both autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration, in particular have received international attention. The importance of both CO2 and methane (CH4) fluxes are emphasised in the Arctic because of the large amount of soil organic carbon stored in terrestrial ecosystems and changes in uptake and release due to climate changes.
   This chapter focuses on controls on spatial and temporal trends in subsurface CO2 and CH4 production as well as on transport and release of gases from the soil observed in the valley Zackenbergdalen. A dominance of near-surface temperatures controlling both spatial and seasonal trends is shown based on data obtained using closed chamber and eddy-correlation techniques as well as in manipulated field plots and in controlled incubation experiments. Despite variable temperature sensitivities reported, most data can be fairly well fitted to exponential temperature-dependent equations. The water content (at wet sites linked to the depth to the water table) is a second major factor regulating soil respiration processes, but the effect is quite different in contrasting vegetation types. Dry heath sites are shown to be periodically water limited during the growing season and respond therefore with high respiration rates when watered. In contrast, water saturated conditions during most of the growing season in the fen areas hinder the availability of oxygen, resulting in both CO2 and CH4 production. Thus, water table drawdown results in decreasing CH4 effluxes but increasing CO2 effluxes.
   Additional controls on gas production are shown to be related to the availability of substrate and plant productivity. Subsurface gas production will produce partial and total pressure gradient causing gas transport, which in well-drained soils is mainly controlled by diffusion, whereas gas advection, bubbles and transport through roots and stems may be important in more saturated soils.
   Bursts of CO2 gas have been observed during spring thaw and confirmed in controlled soil thawing experiments. Field observations as well as experimental work suggest that such bursts represent partly on-going soil respiration and a physical release of gas produced during the winter. The importance of winter soil respiration is emphasised because of the fact that microbial respiration in Zackenberg samples is noted down to a least -18 degrees C. Hence, the importance of winter respiration and burst events in relation to seasonal and future climate trends requires more than just summer measurements. For example, the autumn period seems important as snowfall prior to low air temperature may insulate the soil, keeping soil temperatures high. This will extend the period of high soil respiration rates and thereby increase the importance of the winter period for the annual carbon balance.
   Because of the complexity of factors controlling subsurface gas production, we conclude that different parts of the landscape will respond quite differently to the same climate changes as well as that short-term effects are likely to be different from long-term effects.

TI Export of dissolved organic carbon from an upland peatland during storm

ID BLANKET PEAT; BOREAL CATCHMENTS; WATER; MATTER; RIVER; ACIDIFICATION;

AB Most of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exported from catchments is transported during storm events. Accurate assessments of DOC fluxes are essential to understand long-term trends in the transport of DOC from terrestrial to aquatic systems, and also the toss of carbon from peatlands to determine changes in the source/sink status of peatland carbon stores. However, many long-term monitoring programmes collect water samples at a frequency (e.g. weekly/monthly) less than the time period of a typical storm event (typically < 1-2 days). As widespread observations in catchments dominated by organo-mineral soils have shown that both concentration and flux of DOC increases during storm events, lower frequency monitoring could result in substantial underestimation of DOC flux as the most dynamic periods of transport are missed. However, our intensive monitoring study in a UK upland peatland catchment showed a contrasting response to these previous studies. Our results showed that (i) DOC concentrations decreased during autumn storm events and showed a poor relationship with flow during other seasons; and that (ii) this decrease in concentrations during autumn storms caused DOC flux estimates based on weekly monitoring data to be over-estimated, rather than under-estimated, because of over rather than under estimation of the flow-weighted mean concentration used in flux calculations. However, as DOC flux is ultimately controlled by discharge volume, and therefore rainfall, and the magnitude of change in discharge was greater than the magnitude of decline in concentrations, DOC flux increased during individual storm events. The implications for long-term DOC trends are therefore contradictory, as increased rainfall could increase flux but cause an overall decrease in DOC concentrations from peatland streams. Care needs to be taken when interpreting tong-term trends in DOC flux rather than concentration; as flux is calculated from discharge estimates, and discharge is controlled by rainfall, DOC flux and rainfall/discharge will always be well correlated.

AB This study aims to develop models to describe CO2 fluxes in terms of environmental and meteorological variables and their variation over an Atlantic blanket bog in Glencar, southwest Ireland. Ten full years (September 2002-August 2012) of data were included in the assessment of CO2 flux and micrometeorological data. Models were based on non-gapfilled growing season data, using complete calendar years for annual models, and the entire time-series for weekly models, whilst taking interaction between variables into account for increased model accuracy. This was to determine which environmental variables were most influential in directly controlling CO2 exchange on a long- and short-term basis. A homogeneity of slopes (HOS) model was used to determine if there was any ecosystem response to indirect effects (functional response) of environmental or meteorological interannual variation. This model uses multiple regression analysis to determine if the ecosystem response can be better predicted as a linear function of the variables using a single slope model for all years, or a separate slopes model for each year. The separate slopes model gave a different (and improved) outcome for both daytime and night-time CO2 fluxes, and so functional responses were deemed to have occurred. The contribution to variation of day and night-time net ecosystem exchange (NEEday and NEEnight respectively) was then separated into four components: indirect functional responses, direct interannual meteorological variability, direct week to week meteorological variability, and random error, which identified 13.8%, 36.6%, 28.2% and 21.4% respectively of the variation in NEEday, as well as 23.4%, 24.4%, 22.2% and 30% respectively of the variation in NEEnight. Water table level (WTL) had the greatest influence upon functional variation of NEE at the Glencar blanket peatland, and comparisons of modelled NEEday with leaf area index (LAI) measurements verified the estimate of functional contribution using the separate slopes model. The significance of interannual variation (IAV) and functional responses on NEE at Glencar suggests that it is a resilient ecosystem which might be able to adapt to environmental or climatic changes, although given current climate change predictions, it is likely to have a reduced carbon dioxide sink status in the future.

AB Peatlands store vast amounts of soil carbon and are significant sources of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2) andmethane (CH4) emissions. The traditional approach in biogeochemical model simulations of peatland emissions is to simply divide the soil domain into an aerobic zone above and an anaerobic zone below the water table (WT) and then calculate CO2 and CH4 emissions based on the assumed properties of these two discrete zones. However, there are major potential drawbacks associated with the traditional WT-based approach, because aerobic or anaerobic environments are ultimately determined by oxygen (O-2) concentration rather than water content directly. Variations in O2 content above and below the WT can be large and thus may play an important role in partitioning of carbon fluxes between CO2 and CH4. In this paper, we propose an oxygen-based approach, which simulates the vertical and radial components of O-2 movement and consumption through the soil aerobic and anaerobic environments. We then use both our oxygen-based and the traditional WT-based approaches to simulate CO2 and CH4 emissions from an Alaskan fen peatland. The results of model calibration and validation suggest that our physically realistic approach (i.e., oxygen-based approach) cause less biases on the simulated flux of CO2 and CH4. The results of model simulations also suggest that the traditional WT-based approach might substantially under-estimate CH4 emissions and over-estimate CO2 emissions from the fen due to the presence of anaerobic zones in unsaturated soil. Our oxygen-based approach can be easily incorporated into existing ecosystem or earth system models but will require additional validation with more extensive field observations to be implemented within biogeochemical models to improve simulations of soil C fluxes at regional or global scale.

AB Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured in precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, and soil, peat and stream water in a 50 ha catchment with a central 5 ha swamp at Mont St. Hilaire, Quebec. DOC concentrations in precipitation were low (2.0 mg L-1), but increased in passage through the tree canopies as throughfall (9.1-14.6 mg L-1) and stemflow (23.1-30.1 mg L-1). For the period July 1-November 15, 1987, 0.5 g DOC m-2 was imported as precipitation, and forest canopies contributed a further 1.4-1.7 g m-2 to the soil surface. DOC concentrations were higher (46.0 and 67.6 mg L-1) in upland soil organic horizons, but decreased with depth because subsoil mineral horizons acted as a major sink of DOC. A laboratory experiment using leaf leachate revealed that subsoil horizons were able to adsorb DOC, with equilibrium DOC concentrations ranging from 3 to 19 mg L-1. Soil organic carbon appeared to be an important determinant of equilibrium DOC concentrations. The swamp was a major source of DOC, with an overall average DOC concentration of 58.6 mg L-1 and showed strong spatial and temporal variations related to hydrologic and thermal regimes. During base flow periods, stream DOC concentrations were small (< 3 mg L-1), dominated by water fed from springs draining upland soils. During high flows, stream DOC concentrations increased through the contribution of DOC-rich water originating in the swamp. Sources, sinks and transport of DOC are thus a function of a complex set of inter-related biotic and abiotic process.

AB This paper summarises some of the key results from two European field programmes, WINTEX and LAPP, undertaken in the Boreal/Arctic regions in 1996-98. Both programmes have illustrated the very important role that snow plays within these areas, not only in the determination of energy, water and carbon fluxes in the winter, but also in controlling the length of the summer active season, and hence the overall carbon budget. These studies make a considerable advance in our knowledge of the fluxes from snow-covered landscape and the interactions between snow and vegetation. Also some of the first measurements of greenhouse gas fluxes (carbon dioxide and methane) are reported for the European arctic and sub-arctic. The measurements show a considerable variability across the arctic, with very high instantaneous values from sub-arctic birch and fen areas and extremely low fluxes reported from the polar desert in the high arctic. The overall annual budgets are everywhere limited by the very short active season in these regions. The heat flux over a high latitude boreal forest during late winter was found to be high. At low solar angles the forest shades most of the snow surface, therefore an important part of the radiation never reaches the snow surface but is absorbed by the forest. This indicates that in areas with sparse vegetation and low solar angles, absorption of direct solar radiation is due to an apparent vegetation cover, which is much greater than the actual one.
   The first steps are taken in using these measurements to improve models, both point soil/vegetation/atmosphere transfer schemes and 3D meteorogical models. The results are encouraging; increasing the realism progressively improves the representation of the fluxes. A start is made in developing landscape, or catchment scale models. There seems to be some hope that comparatively simple relationships between evaporation and photosynthesis and leaf area may be sufficiently robust to allow the use of remotely sensed images to investigate the areally averaged exchanges.
   It is suspected that high latitude regions will experience considerable climatic and environmental change in the coming decades. A well found prediction of how these regions will respond requires a comprehensive knowledge of how vegetation will respond and how the changed vegetation will interact with the snow cover and the atmosphere. The studies from the LAPP and WINTEX programmes presented in this volume are an important contribution to this understanding and provide a useful foundation for future research.

AB Two dense and highly enriched (up to 10(9) cells ml(-1), < 10% of bacterial satellites) acido-tolerant (pH 4.0-6.5) methanogenic consortia, '26' and 'K' were isolated from the peat beneath a Sphagnum-Eriophorum-Carex community in West Siberia. Both consortia produced methane from CO2:H-2 on chemically defined, diluted N-free media containing Ti(III)citrate as reducing agent. The phylogenetic analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA revealed three archaeal and nine bacterial sequence types. Consortium '26' contained single archaea Methanobacterium sp., represented by rods of 1.5-10 X 0.5-1.0 &mu;m. In consortium 'K', there were two archaeal phylotypes, the respective methanogens were further differentiated morphologically with the fluorescence in situ hybridization technique: one less abundant ( < 2%) population of the long-curved rods (50-100X0.3-0.4 mum) fell into the order of Methanomicrobiales, while the dominant organism (similar to98%), represented by straight rods with abrupt rectangular ends (3-9X0.5 mum), was affiliated with earlier uncultured 'Rice cluster I'. The main bacterial satellite used citrate as a single carbon and energy source; it was similar in both consortia, and after isolation in pure culture, it was identified as a new member of the alpha-subclass of Proteobacteria. The other bacterial satellites were distributed among four taxonomic groups: the delta-subclass of Proteobacteria, the Flavobacterium-Bacteroides-Cytophaga line of descent, the Acidobacterium-Fibrobacter line of descent and the Green non-sulfur bacteria line of descent. At least 11 out of 12 components of acido-tolerant consortia are new to science at the species, genus and order levels; their existence until now was evident only from environmental gene retrievals. The Sphagnum wetlands, attracting attention only recently because of their global environmental role, are shown to be an especially valuable source of novel prokaryotic organisms.

AB Permafrost deposits in the Beringian Yedoma region store large amounts of organic carbon (OC). Walter Anthony et al. (2014) describe a previously unrecognized pool of 159 Pg OC accumulated in Holocene thermokarst sediments deposited in Yedoma region alases (thermokarst depressions). They claim that these alas sediments increase the previously recognized circumpolar permafrost peat OC pool by 50 %. It is stated that previous integrated studies of the permafrost OC pool have failed to account for these deposits because the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD) is biased towards non-alas field sites and that the soil maps used in the NCSCD underestimate coverage of organic permafrost soils. Here we evaluate these statements against a brief literature review, existing data sets on Yedoma region soil OC storage and independent field-based and geospatial data sets of peat soil distribution in the Siberian Yedoma region. Our findings are summarized in three main points. Firstly, the sediments described by Walter Anthony et al. (2014) are primarily mineral lake sediments and do not match widely used international scientific definitions of peat or organic soils. They can therefore not be considered an addition to the circumpolar peat carbon pool. We also emphasize that a clear distinction between mineral and organic soil types is important since they show very different vulnerability trajectories under climate change. Secondly, independent field data and geospatial analyses show that the Siberian Yedoma region is dominated by mineral soils, not peatlands. Thus, there is no evidence to suggest any systematic bias in the NCSCD field data or maps. Thirdly, there is spatial overlap between these Holocene thermokarst sediments and previous estimates of permafrost soil and sediment OC stocks. These carbon stocks were already accounted for by previous studies and they do not significantly increase the known circumpolar OC pool. We suggest that these inaccurate statements made in Walter Anthony et al. (2014) mainly resulted from misunderstandings caused by conflicting definitions and terminologies across different geoscientific disciplines. A careful cross-disciplinary review of terminologies would help future studies to appropriately harmonize definitions between different fields.

AB Coastal wetlands are globally important sinks of organic carbon (C). However, to what extent wetland C cycling will be affected by accelerated sea-level rise (SLR) and saltwater intrusion is unknown, especially in coastal peat marshes where water flow is highly managed. Our objective was to determine how the ecosystem C balance in coastal peat marshes is influenced by elevated salinity. For two years, we made monthly in situ manipulations of elevated salinity in freshwater (FW) and brackish water (BW) sites within Everglades National Park, Florida, USA. Salinity pulses interacted with marsh-specific variability in seasonal hydroperiods whereby effects of elevated pulsed salinity on gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) were dependent on marsh inundation level. We found little effect of elevated salinity on C cycling when both marsh sites were inundated, but when water levels receded below the soil surface, the BW marsh shifted from a C sink to a C source. During these exposed periods, we observed an approximately threefold increase in CO2 efflux from the marsh as a result of elevated salinity. Initially, elevated salinity pulses did not affect Cladium jamaicense biomass, but aboveground biomass began to be significantly decreased in the saltwater amended plots after two years of exposure at the BW site. We found a 65% (FW) and 72% (BW) reduction in live root biomass in the soil after two years of exposure to elevated salinity pulses. Regardless of salinity treatment, the FW site was C neutral while the BW site was a strong C source (-334 to -454 g C.m(-2).yr(-1)), particularly during dry-down events. A loss of live roots coupled with annual net CO2 losses as marshes transition from FW to BW likely contributes to the collapse of peat soils observed in the coastal Everglades. As SLR increases the rate of saltwater intrusion into coastal wetlands globally, understanding how water management influences C gains and losses from these systems is crucial. Under current Everglades' water management, drought lengthens marsh dry-down periods, which, coupled with saltwater intrusion, accelerates CO2 loss from the marsh.

TI Formation and decay of peat bogs in the vegetable belt of Switzerland
SO SWISS JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE Landscape evolution; Mire degradation; C-losses; Holocene;
   Sedimentation; Land-use change
AB The rapidly collapsing glacial systems of the Alps produced a large number of melt-water lakes and mires after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in the Late Glacial period. The Rhone-Aare-glacier system gave rise to large moorlands and lakes in the region of the Three Lakes Region of Western Switzerland. When moorlands are formed, they are efficient sinks of atmospheric carbon, but when transformed to agricultural land they are significant C sources. In addition, mires can be used as archives for reconstructing landscape evolution. We explored in more detail the dynamics of the landscape of the Three Lakes Region with a particular focus on the formation and degradation of mires. The Bernese part of the Three Lakes Region developed to become-after the optimisation of the water-levels of the Swiss Jura-the vegetable belt of Switzerland. The situation for agriculture, however, has now become critical due to an overexploitation of the peatland. Until c. 13 ka BP the entire region was hydrologically connected. An additional lake existed at the western end of the plain receiving sediments from the Aare river. Around 13 ka BP, this lake was isolated from the Aare river and completely silted up until c. 10 ka BP when a mire started to form. In the valley floor ('Grosses Moos'), the meandering Aare and the varying level of the nearby lake of Neuchatel caused a spatio-temporally patchy formation of mires (start of formation: 10-3 ka BP). Strong morphodynamics having high erosion and sedimentation rates and a high variability of the chemical composition of the deposited material prevailed during the early Holocene until c. 7.5 ka BP. The situation remained relatively quiet between 5 and 2 ka BP. However, during the last 2000 years the hydrodynamic and geomorphic activities have increased again. The optimisation of the Swiss Jura water-levels during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries enabled the transformation of moorland into arable land. As a consequence, the moorland strongly degraded. Mean annual C-losses in agricultural land are c. 4.9 t ha(-1) and c. 2.4 t ha(-1) in forests. Because forests limit, but not stop, the degradation of mires, agroforestry might be tested and propagated in future as alternative land-use systems for such sensitive areas.

AB Globally important carbon (C) stores in northern peatlands are vulnerable to oxidation in a changing climate. A growing body of literature draws attention to the importance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in governing anaerobic metabolism in organic soil, but exactly how the reduction-oxidation (redox) activities of DOM, and particularly the phenolic fraction, are likely to change in an altered climate remain unclear. We used large mesocosms in the PEATcosm experiment to assess changes in peatland DOM and redox potential in response to experimental manipulations of water table (WT) position and plant functional groups (PFGs). WT position and PFGs interacted in their effects on redox potential and quantity and quality of DOM. Phenolics were generally of higher molecular weight and more oxidized with sedges in lowered WTs. Altered DOM character included changes in dissolved nitrogen (N), with higher N: [phenolics] with higher E4:E6 (absorbance ratio lambda = 465:665) DOM in the lowered WT and sedge PFG treatments. Conversely, biomolecular assignments to amino-sugars were largely absent from low-WT treatments. Low WT resulted in the creation of unique N compounds, which were more condensed (lower H:C), that changed with depth and PFG. The accumulation of oxidized compounds with low WT and in sedge rhizospheres could be very important pools of electron acceptors beneath the WT, and their mechanisms of formation are discussed. This work suggests the effects of changes in vegetation communities can be as great as WT position in directly and interactively mediating peat redox environment and the redox-activity of DOM.
   Plain Language Summary Peatlands are important ecosystems in both the global carbon (C) cycle and the Earth's climate system owing to their ability to store vast quantities of C taken from the atmosphere. Peat C stays locked up in these ecosystems largely owing to cool and wet conditions, and as such, these C stores are vulnerable to release back to the atmosphere if the climate or water levels change. Water table level and plant species composition have a combined effect on C and nitrogen (N) cycling in peatlands. We manipulated both factors in an experimental setting composed of 24 large bins into which we put intact peatland miniecosystems. Sedges play a big role in producing N compounds below the peat surface, and this work suggests these compounds can actually be synthesized into larger, less accessible compounds. In addition, activities of sedge roots and other dominant plant communities (such as shrubs in the heath family of plants) may interact in the synthesis of oxidized, larger molecules. These molecules can allow microbes to continue to decompose peat even in the absence of oxygen. This could increase the release of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, while reducing inputs of the stronger greenhouse gas methane.

AB The current paradigm in peatland ecology is that the organic matter inputs from plant photosynthesis (e.g. moss litter) exceed that of decomposition, tipping the metabolic balance in favour of carbon (C) storage. Here, we investigated an alternative hypothesis, whereby exudates released by microalgae can actually accelerate C losses from the surface waters of northern peatlands by stimulating dissolved organic C (DOC) decomposition in a warmer environment expected with climate change. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the biodegradability of fen DOC in a factorial design with and without algal DOC in both ambient (15 degrees C) and elevated (20 degrees C) water temperatures during a laboratory bioassay. When DOC sources were evaluated separately, decomposition rates were higher in treatments with algal DOC only than with fen DOC only, indicating that the quality of the organic matter influenced degradability. A mixture of substrates (1/2 algal DOC + 1/2 fen DOC) exceeded the expected level of biodegradation (i.e. the average of the individual substrate responses) by as much as 10%, and the magnitude of this effect increased to more than 15% with warming. Specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)), a proxy for aromatic content, was also significantly higher (i.e. more humic) in the mixture treatment than expected from SUVA(254) values in single substrate treatments. Accelerated decomposition in the presence of algal DOC was coupled with an increase in bacterial biomass, demonstrating that enhanced metabolism was associated with a more abundant microbial community. These results present an alternative energy pathway for heterotrophic consumers to breakdown organic matter in northern peatlands. Since decomposition in northern peatlands is often limited by the availability of labile organic matter, this mechanism could become increasingly important as a pathway for decomposition in the surface waters of northern peatlands where algae are expected to be more abundant in conditions associated with ongoing climate change.

AB Larch (Larix spp.) forests are predominantly distributed across high latitudes of Eurasia. They potentially have a strong influence on the terrestrial carbon and energy cycles, because of their vast area and the large carbon stocks in their peat soils in the permafrost. In this study, we elucidated intersite variation of ecosystem photosynthetic and respiratory parameters of eight larch forests in East Asia using the CarboEastAsia carbon flux and micrometeorology dataset. These parameters were determined using the empirical relationship between the carbon fluxes (photosynthesis and respiration) and micrometeorological variables (light and temperature). In addition, we examined leaf area index (LAI) determined by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data to explain the intersite variation. Linear or exponential relationships with annual mean temperature or seasonal maximum LAI at the study sites were found for the annual carbon fluxes (gross primary production [GPP] and total ecosystem respiration [RE]) as well as for four of the five seasonal maximum values of determined photosynthetic and respiratory parameters (maximum GPP at light saturation, initial slope of the light-response curve, daytime respiration, and RE at the reference temperature of 10 degrees C). Phenological indices, such as start day of the growing season, growing season length and growing season degree days explained much of the intersite variation of GPP and RE of the studied larch forests; however, the relationship between MODIS LAI and photosynthetic or respiratory parameters implies that the intersite variation in GPP and RE was caused not only by the temperature variation (abiotic factor), but also by the variation in the photosynthetic and respiration activity by vegetation (biotic factor) through the change in leaf (or whole vegetation) biomass. Our analysis shows that MODIS LAI serves as a good index to explain the variation of the ecosystem photosynthetic and respiratory characteristics of East Asian larch forests.

AB Background and Aims The carbon (C) balance of boreal terrestrial ecosystems is sensitive to increasing temperature, but the direction and thresholds of responses are uncertain. Annual C uptake in Picea and other evergreen boreal conifers is dependent on seasonal-and cohort-specific photosynthetic and respiratory temperature response functions, so this study examined the physiological significance of maintaining multiple foliar cohorts for Picea mariana trees within an ombrotrophic bog ecosystem in Minnesota, USA.
   Methods Measurements were taken on multiple cohorts of needles for photosynthetic capacity, foliar respiration (R-d) and leaf biochemistry and morphology of mature trees from April to October over 4 years. The results were applied to a simple model of canopy photosynthesis in order to simulate annual C uptake by cohort age under ambient and elevated temperature scenarios.
   Key Results Temperature responses of key photosynthetic parameters [i.e. light-saturated rate of CO2 assimilation (A(sat)), rate of Rubisco carboxylation (V-cmax) and electron transport rate (J(max))] were dependent on season and generally less responsive in the developing current-year (Y0) needles compared with 1-year-old (Y1) or 2-year-old (Y2) foliage. Temperature optimums ranged from 18.7 to 23.7, 31.3 to 38.3 and 28.7 to 36.7 degrees C for A(sat), V-cmax and J(max), respectively. Foliar cohorts differed in their morphology and photosynthetic capacity, which resulted in 64 % of modelled annual stand C uptake from Y1&2 cohorts (LAI 0.67m(2) m(-2)) and just 36 % from Y0 cohorts (LAI 0.52 m(2) m(-2)). Under warmer climate change scenarios, the contribution of Y0 cohorts was even less; e.g. 31 % of annual C uptake for a modelled 9 degrees C rise in mean summer temperatures. Results suggest that net annual C uptake by P. mariana could increase under elevated temperature, and become more dependent on older foliar cohorts.
   Conclusions Collectively, this study illustrates the physiological and ecological significance of different foliar cohorts, and indicates the need for seasonal-and cohort-specific model parameterization when estimating C uptake capacity of boreal forest ecosystems under ambient or future temperature scenarios.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a significant component of carbon and nutrient cycling in fluvial ecosystems. Natural wetlands, as important DOC sources for river and ocean ecosystems, have experienced extensive natural and anthropogenic disturbances such as climate change, hydrological variations and land use change in recent years. The DOC characteristics in surface ponds from contrasting wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeastern China were investigated. Surface ponds at seven sites (two natural phialiform wetlands, three natural riparian wetlands, one degraded wetland and one artificial wetland, i.e., rice paddy) were monitored during the growing seasons of 2009 and 2010. The results show that the surface ponds at the five natural wetland sites exhibited a wide range of DOC concentrations (10.06-48.73 mg L-1) during the study period. The DOC concentrations showed no annual differences (P > 0.05) at all the wetland sites, except one of the phialiform wetland sites. The two phialiform wetlands exhibited higher DOC concentrations than the three riparian wetlands (P < 0.05). The DOC concentration in the surface pond at the artificial wetland site was relatively low (P < 0.05) compared to that at the degraded wetland site. The C/C ratios (the color per carbon unit ratio, Abs(400)/DOC concentration) showed inconsistent variations among these seven wetland sites, while the E4/E6 ratio (Abs(465)/Abs(665), fulvic acid/humic acid) from the surface pond in the rice paddy land exerted 42.07-55.36% reductions (P < 0.05), compared to those at the five natural wetland sites. Furthermore, the E4/E6 ratio in the surface pond at the rice paddy site was significantly lower compared to that at the degraded wetland site (P < 0.05), which indicated that disturbance to wetland DOC in surface ponds might be stronger when natural wetlands were converted to rice paddies in comparison with wetland degradation. This study could not only provide insightful points for understanding the aquatic DOC dynamics from different wetland ecosystems, but also support data information for incorporating the aquatic DOC into the model for regional carbon budgets in the future.

AB A model framework for national greenhouse gas emission and removal estimation for Canadian peatlands (CaMP v2.0) was developed and tested. It provides a module that can work alongside the upland forest Generic Carbon Budget Model (GCBM) developed to eventually replace the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3) as the core model in Canada's National Forest Carbon Monitoring, Accounting and Reporting System. The CaMP (v2.0) provides a simple model foundation that can be applied nationally for 11 different peatland categories. It tracks the growth, turnover and decay in annual time steps of different vegetation components (foliage, branches, stems, and roots of trees, shrubs, sedges and mosses). It uses a Q(10) relationship to model peat C pool decomposition as a function of mean annual temperature, and models methane flux response to deviations in annual water table depth. The CaMP takes a simple approach to modeling hydrology for large spatial scales by using the nationally-available Canadian Fire Weather Index Drought Code to predict long-term and annual water table depth. The CaMP (v2.0) provides the framework needed to model disturbances but only includes wildfire in this version. Model behavior and sensitivity were assessed, and evaluated against observed flux data. Results suggest that the CaMP (v2.0) provides an appropriate structure for large spatial- and temporal-scale estimation of emissions, owing to the model behaving as expected relative to shifts in environmental variables, and to reasonably small mean observed to modeled residuals. Methane was overestimated by the model on average by 6 g C ha(-1) y(-1) (n = 53 years of data across 11 peatland sites), and by 8 g C ha(-1) y(-1) when weighted by site location (n = 12 sites, >= 3 years of data per site). The model overestimated net ecosystem exchange (NEE) by 20 g C ha(-1) y(-1) (n = 36 years of data across 12 peatland sites), and by 2 g C ha(-1) y(-1) when weighted by site location (n = 11 sites, >= 3 years of data per site), and results demonstrate that inter-site variation is greater than temporal variation across NEE measures. Several aspects were identified as requiring further work to increase explained variation in finer-scale emission estimates. Recommendations include further expanding the existing peatland databases to re-calibrate peat decomposition rates and better parameterize NPP rates by region for certain vegetation layers and peatland types, as well as developing a national annual-scale soil temperature model that could serve to replace the air temperature (Q(10)) decay relationship currently used in the CaMP (v2.0). Data gaps that were identified include the need for annualized methane flux datasets with appropriate annual-scale meta-data. Future work is required to include permafrost dynamics, as well as additional natural, and anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Peatlands are a major source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for aquatic ecosystems. Naturally high DOC concentrations in peatlands may be increased further by drainage. For agricultural purposes, peat has frequently been mixed with sand, but the effect of this measure on the release and cycling of DOC has rarely been investigated. This study examined the effects of (i) mixing peat with sand and (ii) water table depth (WTD) on DOC concentrations at three grassland sites on shallow organic soils. The soil solution was sampled bi-weekly for two years with suction plates at 15, 30 and 60 cm depth. Selected samples were analysed for dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), delta C-13(Dom) and delta N-15(DOM.)
   Average DOC concentrations were surprisingly high, ranging from 161 to 192 mg 1(-1). There was no significant impact of soil organic carbon (SOC) content or WTD on mean DOC concentrations. At all sites, DOC concentrations were highest at the boundary between the SOC-rich horizon and the mineral subsoil. In contrast to the mean concentrations, the temporal patterns of DOC concentrations, their drivers and the properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) differed between peat-sand mixtures and peat. DOC concentrations responded to changes in environmental conditions, but only after a lag period of a few weeks. At the sites with a peat-sand mixture, temperature and therefore probably biological activity determined the DOC concentrations. At the peat site, the contribution of vegetation derived DOM was higher. The highest concentrations occurred during long, cool periods of waterlogging, suggesting a stronger physicochemical-based DOC mobilisation. Overall, these results indicate that mixing peat with sand does not improve water quality and.may result in DOC losses of around 200 kg DOC ha(-1) a(-1). (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Peatlands drained for agriculture are sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Resulting emissions may depend on land-use, often as grassland or cropland, but few studies have directly compared the effects of land-uses. Here, we measured annual emissions of CO2, N2O and methane (CH4) from five sites in a temperate bog, representing an undrained natural bog (NB) site, and four drained sites used as permanent grassland (PG) and croplands with rotations of oat-potato, oat-spring barley and potato-spring barley (PO:SB) in the study year. Gas fluxes were measured at 1-2 week intervals using static chambers, and auxiliary data were obtained, such as temperature, depth of water table, ratio-vegetation index, pH and soil mineral N. Annual CO2 emissions were derived from empirical modelling, whereas CH4 and N2O emissions were linearly interpolated between measurement dates by bootstrapping. Soil respiration was lower at the NB site (1.8 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1)) than at the drained sites where emissions were in the range of 5.0-8.8 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1). The N2O emission was negligible at NB (0.3 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)), low at three of the drained sites (1.5-3.7 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)), but high at PO:SB (37.7 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)). The CH4 emission was high at NB (172 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1)), but negligible at the drained sites (-1.5 to 1.5 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1)). The soil respiration at the drained sites indicated that peat losses were rather similar among the different cropping systems and depended mostly on drainage status, although soil respiration and peat mineralization may not scale directly. The pattern of N2O emissions suggested an increased risk of N2O emission from potato cultivation before and after the period of potato growth, likely due to microbial availability of NO3- outside the growing season. For initiatives aiming at reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural peat soils, this means that, e.g., conversion from cropland to permanent grassland should preferably be accompanied by measures of rewetting, whereas for potato cropping, N availability outside the growing season should be minimized.

AB Wetlands and their ability to mitigate climate change motivates restorative and protective action; however, scientific understanding of land-atmosphere interactions is restricted by our limited continuous observations of gaseous fluxes. Many wetlands are small in spatial scale and embedded in forested landscapes. Yet, little is known about how the relative sheltering of forests affects net carbon (C) and energy balance. Here, we analyze coterminous USGS and Ameriflux eddy covariance flux tower observations over 3 years in two shrub fens in Northern Wisconsin, one more sheltered (US-ALQ) than the other (US-Los). Unsurprisingly, the open site showed higher overall wind speeds. This should have implications for atmospheric fluxes in wetlands as wind-forced processes are essential in promoting gas exchange over water. While both sites had similar half-hourly net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) during daytime, there were significant differences in nighttime NEE, as well as in net radiation partitioning in early spring and late summer. Sensible heat (H) fluxes were smaller at the sheltered fen except for the months of July-September. In contrast, latent heat (LE) fluxes were higher in every month except July. Additionally, sheltered fen ecosystem respiration had a weaker linear correlation with air temperature (R: 0.08 vs. 0.57 for the open fen). Our work suggests that canopy sheltering does not cause significant differences in half-hourly NEE during the day, but rather the largest differences such as lower CO2 emissions occur at nighttime due to higher variance at very low wind speeds. Sheltering also influenced direction of air flow, mean wind speeds in day vs. night, energy balance, and sensible and latent heat fluxes. We discuss implications of these findings for wetland restoration.

AB A new approach for the estimation of soil organic carbon (SOC) pools north of the tree line has been developed based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR; ENVISAT Advanced SAR Global Monitoring mode) data. SOC values are directly determined from backscatter values instead of upscaling using land cover or soil classes. The multi-mode capability of SAR allows application across scales. It can be shown that measurements in C band under frozen conditions represent vegetation and surface structure properties which relate to soil properties, specifically SOC. It is estimated that at least 29 Pg C is stored in the upper 30 cm of soils north of the tree line. This is approximately 25% less than stocks derived from the soil-map-based Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD). The total stored carbon is underestimated since the established empirical relationship is not valid for peatlands or strongly cryoturbated soils. The approach does, however, provide the first spatially consistent account of soil organic carbon across the Arctic. Furthermore, it could be shown that values obtained from 1 km resolution SAR correspond to accounts based on a high spatial resolution (2 m) land cover map over a study area of about 7 x 7 km in NE Siberia. The approach can be also potentially transferred to medium-resolution C-band SAR data such as ENVISAT ASAR Wide Swath with similar to 120m resolution but it is in general limited to regions without woody vegetation. Global Monitoring-mode-derived SOC increases with unfrozen period length. This indicates the importance of this parameter for modelling of the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon storage.

AB This study aims to investigate diversity, distribution, status, ecosystem services and threats to the plant resources in the study area based on field survey and ethno ecological knowledge for effective conservation and sustainable ecosystem services. The present study was conducted in the world's high elevation Khunjerab National Park (KNP) of the Karakoram ranges in Pakistan bordering China. Tremendous ecosystem services are obtained from the park and considered the most important habitat for many plant biodiversity and wildlife species. Field surveys were conducted to collect plants in transect along the road side of seven valleys ranging from 3160m to 4934m altitudinal variation. The names and traditional uses were recorded from the local people of the area by semi structured questionnaires and direct interviews. The data was analyzed by excel spreadsheets, direct matrix ranking, and pair comparison tests. Asteraceae was the dominant family with 15% species followed by Chenopodiaceae 10%, Poaceae 8%, Papilionaceae and Rocaceae 7%each, Brasicaceae 6%. Plant resources contribute direct and indirect ecosystem services such as food, medicine, fuel, timber, thatching, water purification, mineral and soil retention, and most importantly as sink of global carbon stock especially in the high altitude peatlands. Herbs were the dominant species in the area with 89%. Fodder is the most common usage for plants, followed by medicine. Plants with percentages 27% and 39% found to be highly palatable and palatable respectively. Competition for food between wildlife and livestock was high recorded for 60% plants. Plants used to cure various diseases including stomachache, asthma, cancer and tuberculosis etc. Plant resources in KNP are unique and vary with climate and altitude. This floral wealth is under tremendous threats of global climate change and anthropogenic activities like overgrazing, increasing population, and a rapidly declining traditional knowledge for sustainable use. Awareness for sustainable harvesting of plants, reducing grazing pressure, equitable resource sharing, marketing of the products, effective management and policy decisions and research on ecosystem services assessment, valuation and climate change impact on wild plant resources are recommended.

AB Minerotrophic mires (fens) represent an important part of the Northern peatlands (5*10(5) km(2)) and act as one of the most important sinks for terrestrial bond carbon and nitrogen. We have tried to clear up the influence of different management practices on nitrous oxide fluxes of these ecosystems. For this purpose investigations were performed on representative sites of the highly disturbed (degraded), N rich fen sites in Northeast Germany (5*10(3) ha): Paulinenaue (Rhin-Havelluch/Brandenburg, shallow cultivated grassland), Heinrichswalde (Friedlander Grobe Wiese/Mecklenburg-Vorpommem, deeply cultivated grassland), Muncheberg (Gumnitz, partially drained alder swamp forest). The annual flux rates showed a broad range. Especially newly drained fen sites (up to 26,9 kg N2O-N*ha(-1*)a(-1)) and grassland with high amounts of mineral fertilizer (480 kg N ha(-1) a(-1), calcium ammonium nitrate) or cattle waste (371 kg N*ha(-1) as urine) represent significant sources of nitrous oxide (7,2-15,7 kg N2O-N*ha(-1*)a(-1)). Mowing and moderate N fertilization rates (two cuts and rates up to 120 kg N*ha(-1)) caused only a weak increase in nitrous oxide emission (1,2-5,4 kg N2O-N*ha(-1*a)a(-1)), Reflooding led to an additional strong reduction of nitrous oxide fluxes (0,1-0,8 kg N2O-N*ha(-1*)a(-1)). The considerable temporal and spatial variability of flux rates was obviously induced by complex interactions of many factors and processes like water table, management systems, weather (especially by frost periods), soil degradation, plant growth, C/N transformation, and matter output on the emission rates in fens. However, the disturbed fens represent a significant source of nitrous oxide in Germany. Fens only occupy approx. 5,4 % of Germans total agricultural area, but their overall flux rate of 6574 t N2O-N*a(-1) has a share of approx. 12,4 % in the total nitrous oxide emission from German agriculture.

AB Healthy wetlands play a significant role in climate change mitigation by storing carbon that would otherwise contribute to global warming, leading to the reduction of water and food resources as well as more extreme weather phenomena. Investigating the magnitude of carbon storage potential of different freshwater wetland systems using multiple ecological indicators at varying spatial scales provides insight and justification for selective wetland restoration and conservation initiatives. We provide a holistic accounting of total carbon values for 193 wetland sites, integrating existing carbon algorithms to rapidly assess each of the following carbon pools: above-ground, below-ground, soil, woody debris, shrub cover, and herbaceous cover. Aspects of soil, vegetation, and ecosystem characteristics and stressors were measured to obtain an overall understanding of the ecosystems ability to store carbon (long-term) along a gradient of human disturbance. Based on a review of the literature, methods were prioritized based on the initial data available from field measurements as well as their practicality and ease in replicating the process in the future. Lacustrine human impounded (88.7 +/- 18.0tC/ha), riverine beaver impounded (116.2 +/- 29.4tC/ha), riverine upper perennial (163.3 +/- 11.8tC/ha), riverine lower perennial (199.2 +/- 24.7tC/ha), riverine headwater complex (159.5 +/- 22.2tC/ha), perennial/seasonal depression (269.6 +/- 42.4tC/ha), and slope (162.2 +/- 14.6tC/ha) wetland types were compared. Overall results showed moderate variability (9.33-835.95tC/ha) for total carbon storage values across the wetland types, with an average total carbon storage of 174.6 +/- 8.8tC/ha for all wetlands. Results show that carbon storage was significantly higher (p=0.002) in least disturbed wetland sites. Apart from perennial/seasonal depression wetlands, all reference standard wetlands had greater carbon storage, less disturbance impact, and a greater extent of forest cover than non-reference wetlands. Carbon storage values calculated were comparable to published literature.

AB Hydrological and biogeochemical processes in terrestrial watershed compartments are an important source of short- and long-term physico-chemical dynamics in Precambrian Shield headwater lakes. In this study, a residual analysis of concentration discharge models based on the composite method of stream solute flux estimation was conducted to quantify two key factors contributing to terrestrialaquatic export of sulphate (SO42-), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), hydronium ion (H+) and colour for ten Precambrian Shield catchments in three lake basins: (1) advective transport capacity, as influenced by variations in runoff, and (2) the terrestrial supply of mobilizable solute, as influenced by terrestrial biogeochemical cycling and associated controlling variables. Overall, annual fluxes associated with mechanism (2) were approximately equal to those associated with mechanism (1) in driving inter-annual deviations from long-term mean annual solute export. There was considerable variation in the relative contributions of these mechanisms among solutes and watersheds, and % wetland area could not explain these differences. However, mean annual terrestrial-aquatic fluxes of DOC and colour were highly correlated with % wetland area, as were inter-annual variations in mean annual flux. The corresponding relationships between H+ and % wetland area were moderate but also significant. Annual fluxes SO42- were negatively associated with wetlands but there was no relationship between inter-annual variations in mean annual SO42- flux and % wetland area. The contribution of forested wetlands to annual flux variability for DOC, colour and H+ was primarily driven by inter-annual differences in runoff and associated mobilization of large solute pools within these critical source areas of organic carbon and acidity.

AB Aims Culture media compositions and bioprocess conditions were studied to improve the production of cell biomass and indolic phytohormones byHerbaspirillum seropedicaeBR11471, a plant growth promoting bacterium, and different inoculant formulations were also produced and tested for their stability and shelf life. Methods Response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite rotation designs (CCRD) was used to find bioprocess variables that lead to an increase in bacterial biomass and yield of indolic compounds. The major components of DYGS medium were optimized in small-scale shaken cultivations, in two sets of CCRD. High performance liquid chromatography was used to determine nutrient consumption and to correlate it with cell biomass production, and the Salkowski method was used to quantify indoles. Hydrolytic activity in the formulations was quantified with the fluorescein diacetate assay. Results Glycerol (5.5 g L-1) and yeast extract (2.8 g L-1), as the main carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively, increased biomass production by 87.5% when compared to original DYGS medium, reaching 3.0 g L(-1)of dry cell weight (DCW). In a 2.0 L bioreactor, the optimized medium was used to enhance process conditions for DCW and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Biomass production reached 3.4 g L(-1)and was restrained at highest air flow levels. The conditions of 34-36 degrees C, 150 rpm and 4.0 L min(-1)of air flow rate resulted in 11.97 mg L(-1)of IAA, an increase of 370% over original DYGS at 30 degrees C. Peat can still be regarded as a good cell carrier for solid state inoculants, whilst the additives tested for liquid formulations are individually more efficient than the mixture. Conclusions The production of inoculants containingH. seropedicaestrain BR11471 can be efficiently improved with the use of the RSM approach i.e. it maximizes the production of biomass and indolic compounds, and reduces culture media components, both key factors for large-scale industrial production.

AB Belowground interactions between plants and microorganisms are involved in numerous ecosystems processes such as carbon and nutrient cycling. Understanding their responses to on-going climate warming is thus of paramount importance to better predict future ecosystem functioning. We hypothesized that climate warming alters the interactions between Sphagnum litter phenolics and the fungal root symbiosis of the Ericale plant Andromeda polifolia in a Jura mountain peatland (France). We initiate a climate warming treatment (+1 degrees C) in April 2008 in two microhabitats (lawns and hummocks). We measured polyphenolic contents, mycorrhizal and dark septate endophyte (DSE) root colonization, phenoloxidase and peroxidase activities in the A. polifolia rhizosphere from 2010 to 2012. We found that four years of warming modulated rhizospheric parameters (fungal root symbiosis and enzyme activities) of A. polifolia, but the response differed between microhabitats. Enzyme activities and fungal root colonization displayed different responses to warming according to the microhabitats. DSE root colonization increased and peroxidase activities decreased in warmed Hummocks while they remained stable in warmed lawns. We found a significant positive correlation between DSE root colonization and litter phenolics recovered in both microhabitats but only under in ambient conditions. On the contrary, significant negative correlation was observed between mycorrhizae and litter phenolics recovered in warmed plots while no relationship was found in control plots. Our work thus provides evidences that interplay between phenolics from Sphagnum litter and fungal symbiosis of an Ericale species in peatlands was affected by climate warming. It highlights different plant biological responses to climate warming according to peatland microhabitats and confirm that belowground activities are crucial to understand the response of peatlands to climate change.

AB Inland waters, particularly small and shallow lakes, are significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. However, the spatial inlake heterogeneity of CO2 and CH4 production processes and their drivers in the sediment remain poorly studied. We measured potential CO2 and CH4 production in slurry incubations from 12 sites within the small and shallow crater lake Windsborn in Germany, as well as fluxes at the water-atmosphere interface of intact sediment core incubations from four sites. Production rates were highly variable and ranged from 7.2 to 38.5 mu mol CO2 gC(-1) d(-1) and from 5.4 to 33.5 mu mol CH4 gC(-1) d(-1). Fluxes ranged from 4.5 to 26.9 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) and from 0 to 9.8 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1). Both CO2 and CH4 production rates and the CH4 fluxes exhibited a significant and negative correlation (p<0.05, rho < 0.6) with a prevalence of recalcitrant organic matter (OM) compounds in the sediment as identified by Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy. The carbon/nitrogen ratio exhibited a significant negative correlation (p<0 .01, rho = -0.88) with CH4 fluxes but not with production rates or CO2 fluxes. The availability of inorganic (nitrate, sulfate, ferric iron) and organic (humic acids) electron acceptors failed to explain differences in CH4 production rates, assuming a competitive suppression, but observed non-methanogenic CO2 production could be explained up to 91% by prevalent electron acceptors. We did not find clear relationships between OM quality, the thermodynamics of methanogenic pathways (acetoclastic vs. hydrogenotrophic) and electron-accepting capacity of the OM. Differences in CH4 fluxes were interestingly to a large part explained by grain size distribution (p<0.05, rho = +/- 0.65). Surprisingly though, sediment gas storage, potential production rates and water-atmosphere fluxes were decoupled from each other and did not show any correlations. Our results show that within a small lake, sediment CO2 and CH4 production shows significant spatial variability which is mainly driven by spatial differences in the degradability of the sediment OM. We highlight that studies on production rates and sediment quality need to be interpreted with care, though, in terms of deducing emission rates and patterns as approaches based on production rates only neglect physical sediment properties and production and oxidation processes in the water column as major controls on actual emissions.

AB Bioenergy crop cultivation on former peat extraction areas is a potential after-use option that provides a source of renewable energy while mitigating climate change through enhanced carbon (C) sequestration. This study investigated the full C and greenhouse gas (GHG) balances of fertilized (RCG-F) and nonfertilized (RCG-C) reed canary grass (RCG; Phalaris arundinacea) cultivation compared to bare peat (BP) soil within an abandoned peat extraction area in western Estonia during a dry year. Vegetation sampling, static chamber and lysimeter measurements were carried out to estimate above- and belowground biomass production and allocation, fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in cultivated strips and drainage ditches as well as the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export, respectively. Heterotrophic respiration was determined from vegetation-free trenched plots. Fertilization increased the above- to belowground biomass production ratio and the autotrophic to heterotrophic respiration ratio. The full C balance (incl. CO2, CH4 and DOC fluxes from strips and ditches) was 96, 215 and 180g Cm(-2)yr(-1) in RCG-F, RCG-C and BP, respectively, suggesting that all treatments acted as C sources during the dry year. The C balance was driven by variations in the net CO2 exchange, whereas the combined contribution of CH4 and DOC fluxes was <5%. The GHG balances were 3.6, 7.9 and 6.6t CO2 eqha(-1)yr(-1) in RCG-F, RCG-C and BP, respectively. The CO2 exchange was also the dominant component of the GHG balance, while the contributions of CH4 and N2O were <1% and 1-6%, respectively. Overall, this study suggests that maximizing plant growth and the associated CO2 uptake through adequate water and nutrient supply is a key prerequisite for ensuring sustainable high yields and climate benefits in RCG cultivations established on organic soils following drainage and peat extraction.

AB Plant growth forms are widely used to predict the effects of environmental changes, such as climate warming and increased nitrogen deposition, on plant communities, and the consequences of species shifts for carbon and nutrient cycling. We investigated whether the relationship between growth forms and patterns in litter quality and decomposition are independent of environmental conditions and whether growth forms are as good as litter chemistry at predicting decomposability.
   We used a natural, latitudinal gradient in NW Europe as a spatial analogue for future increases in temperature and nitrogen availability. Our screening of 70 species typical of Sphagnum-dominated peatlands showed that leaf litters of Sphagnum mosses, evergreen and deciduous shrubs, graminoids and forbs differed significantly in litter chemistry and that the ranking of the growth forms was independent of the region for all litter chemistry variables. Differences among growth forms were usually larger than differences related to the environmental gradient.
   After 8 and 20 months incubation in outdoor, Sphagnum-based decomposition beds, growth forms generally differed in decomposability, but these patterns varied with latitude. Sphagnum litters decomposed slower than other litters in all regions, again explaining its high representation in organic deposits of peatlands. Forb litters generally decomposed fastest, while the differences among the other growth forms were small, particularly at higher latitudes.
   Multiple regression analyses showed that growth forms were better at predicting leaf litter decomposition than chemical variables in warm-temperate peatlands with a high N-load, but less so in the subarctic, low-N region.
   Our results indicate that environmental changes may be less important in determining ecosystem leaf litter chemistry directly than are their indirect effects through changes in the relative abundance of growth forms. However, climatic and nutritional constraints in high-latitude peatlands promote convergence towards nutrient-efficient plant traits, resulting in similar decomposition rates of vascular growth forms despite differences in litter chemistry. The usefulness of the growth-form concept in predicting plant community controls on ecosystem functioning is therefore somewhat limited.

AB Concentrations of total carbon and nitrogen were measured by gas chromatography method, and the carbon content of inorganic compounds was determined by the volumetric method in soils of undisturbed coastal landscapes of the Barents Sea (Khaypudyrskaya Bay). Two groups of soils were specified. The first group included saline marsh soils formed under flooding by tidewater and surging seawater. The second group included soils of tundra ecosystems, which were subjected to precipitation of marine aerosols. In the first group, the content of C-org varied from 5 to 75 g/kg, the content of N total varied from 1 to 5 g/kg, and the C-org/N-tot ratio varied from 10 to 18. Humus-accumulative horizons buried under recent marine sediments were described in the middle part of the marsh soil profile. In the second group, the contents of C-org was 430-470 g/kg and N-tot 4-7 g/kg. The C-org/N-tot ratio in the surface peat horizons equaled to 64-95 g/kg and decreased by three-seven times in the deeper layers. The soils of the low-level marshes flooded each tide and especially their surface horizons contained more inorganic carbon than any other soils. Mass fraction of inorganic carbon varied from 4 to 20% of the total carbon content. Seawater and carbonate-containing rocks could be the source of the inorganic carbon. A correlation was found between the contents of C-org and N-tot in soils and in plant communities growing on these soils. Additional input of C-org and N-tot into marsh soils was due to the living activity of birds and to organic substances in seawater.

AB Large-scale changes in climate may have many unexpected effects on ecosystems, given the importance of climate as a control over almost all ecosystem attributes and their many internal feedbacks. In particular, the interactions among energy flux, plant dynamics, and soil carbon and nutrient cycling are poorly known. In this study, we examined biotic controls over soil temperature and evapotranspiration (ET) in a climate change experiment in two peatlands, a bog and a fen. Bogs are isolated from groundwater inputs (i.e., ombrogenous) and are acidic, whereas fens receive groundwater inputs (i.e., minerogenous) and are more alkaline. They also have many associated differences in soil chemistry, nutrient availability, and plant communities.
   We removed 27 intact peat monoliths each from a bog and a fen in northern Minnesota to construct a large mesocosm facility that allows for direct manipulation of climatic variables in a replicated experimental design. The treatment design was a fully crossed factorial with three infrared-loading treatments, three water table treatments, and two ecosystem types (bogs and fens), with three replicates of all treatment combinations. Heating was achieved with overhead infrared lamps, so soil temperature was a dependent variable.
   Increased infrared loading caused mean monthly soil temperature to increase by 1.6 degrees-4.1 degrees C at 15 cm depth during the growing season (May-October). The soil temperature response was strongly seasonal, with much greater effects during the growing season than during the winter. Within the growing season, heating caused greater increases in soil temperature in May-June in the bog plots and in May-June and September-October in the fen plots. Occasionally during the winter, increased infrared loading cooled the soil by up to 5.1 degrees C, probably due to melting of the insulating snow cover. Fen plots were on average 0.8 degrees-1.0 degrees C warmer than bog plots during the growing season, although bog plots had a steeper soil temperature gradient with depth. Water level had no effect on soil temperature.
   Annual ET was 12-23% greater in the bog plots than in the fen plots, at least partially explaining the cooler soil temperatures in the bog plots due to latent heat of evaporation. Additionally, warmer, wetter conditions increased ET. In the fen plots, ET was more sensitive to water table depth than in the bog plots. Differences in the composition and seasonality of the plant canopies accounted for much of the observed differences in ET between bog and fen mesocosms, and hence soil temperature. We present a conceptual model of how above- and belowground ecosystem processes control energy fluxes in northern peatlands and suggest that such controls represent a general phenomenon that should be incorporated into climate change models that include biotic feedbacks.

AB Coastal zones connect terrestrial and marine ecosystems forming a unique environment that is under increasing anthropogenic pressure. Rising sea levels, sinking coasts, and changing precipitation patterns modify hydrodynamic gradients and may enhance sea-land exchange processes in both tidal and non-tidal systems. Furthermore, the removal of flood protection structures as restoration measure contributes locally to the changing coastlines. A detailed understanding of the ecosystem functioning of coastal zones and the interactions between connected terrestrial and marine ecosystems is still lacking. Here, we propose an interdisciplinary approach to the investigation of interactions between land and sea at shallow coasts, and discuss the advantages and the first results provided by this approach as applied by the research training group Baltic TRANSCOAST. A low-lying fen peat site including the offshore shallow sea area on the southern Baltic Sea coast has been chosen as a model system to quantify hydrophysical, biogeochemical, sedimentological, and biological processes across the land-sea interface. Recently introduced rewetting measures might have enhanced submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) as indicated by distinct patterns of salinity gradients in the near shore sediments, making the coastal waters in front of the study site a mixing zone of fresh- and brackish water. High nutrient loadings, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved organic matter (DOM) originating from the degraded peat may affect micro- and macro-phytobenthos, with the impact propagating to higher trophic levels. The terrestrial part of the study site is subject to periodic brackish water intrusion caused by occasional flooding, which has altered the hydraulic and biogeochemical properties of the prevailing peat soils. The stable salinity distribution in the main part of the peatland reveals the legacy of flooding events. Generally, elevated sulfate concentrations are assumed to influence greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, mainly by inhibiting methane production, yet our investigations indicate complex interactions between the different biogeochemical element cycles (e.g., carbon and sulfur) caused by connected hydrological pathways. In conclusion, sea-land interactions are far reaching, occurring on either side of the interface, and can only be understood when both long-term and event-based patterns and different spatial scales are taken into account in interdisciplinary research that involves marine and terrestrial expertise.

AB Sphagnum bogs play an important role when considering the impacts of global change on global carbon and nitrogen cycles. Sphagnum recurvum P. Beauv. var. mucronatum (Russ.) was grown at 360 (ambient) and 700 mu L L-1 (elevated) atmospheric [CO2] in combination with different nitrogen deposition rates (6, 15, 23 g N m(-2) y(-1)), in a short- and long-term growth chamber experiment.
   After 6 months, elevated atmospheric [CO2] in combination with the lowest nitrogen deposition rate, increased plant dry mass by 17%. In combination with a high nitrogen deposition rate, biomass production was not significantly stimulated.
   At the start of the experiment, photosynthesis was stimulated by elevated atmospheric [CO2], but it was downregulated to control levels after three days of exposure. Elevated [CO2] substantially reduced dark respiration, which resulted in a continuous increase in soluble sugar content in capitula. Differences in growth response among different nitrogen and CO2 treatments could not be related to measured carbon exchange rates, which was mainly due to interference of microbial respiration.
   Doubling atmospheric [CO2] reduced total nitrogen content in capitula but not in stems at all nitrogen deposition rates. Reduction in total nitrogen content coincided with a decrease in amino acids, but soluble protein levels remained unaffected. Thus, elevated [CO2] induced a substantial shift in the partitioning of nitrogen compounds in capitula. Soluble sugar concentration was negatively correlated with total nitrogen content, which implies that the reduction in amino acid content in capitula, exposed to elevated [CO2], might be caused by the accumulation of soluble sugars.
   Growth was not stimulated by increased nitrogen deposition. High nitrogen deposition, resulting in a capitulum nitrogen content in excess of 15 mg g(-1) dw, was detrimental to photosynthesis, reduced water content and induced necrosis. We propose a capitulum nitrogen content of 15 mg g(-1) dw as a possible bioindicator for the detection of nitrogen pollution stress in oligo-mesotrophic peat bog ecosystems.
   At the lowest nitrogen deposition level, nitrogen recovery was higher than 100%, which indicates substantial dry deposition and/or gaseous nitrogen fixation by bacteria, associated with Sphagnum. Increasing nitrogen deposition rates decreased nitrogen recovery percentages, which indicates reduced efficiency of nitrogen fixation.

AB Riparian zones have been investigated in order to determine the processes that control the removal of agriculturally derived nitrate from groundwater: however, many gaps exist in our understanding of the functioning of riparian zones as regulators of nitrate fluxes in shallow groundwater. In this study, a reactive-transport model is applied to simulate organic carbon, nitrate, and nitrogen isotope behavior during denitrification in a river riparian zone. The model includes the reactive-tran sport processes presented by MacQuarrie and Sudicky [J. Contam. Hydrol. 47 (2001) 53], but has been extended to compute nitrogen isotope fractionation during biogeochemical reactions. Numerical simulation results have been compared to field data from a well-characterized river riparian aquifer and the comparison shows that the model captures the essential reactive-transport processes for major reactive species, including delta(15)N. A surficial peat zone is the main source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and the supply of this DOC to underlying sands and gravels by hydrodynamic processes controls the denitrification of upland nitrate flowing into the riparian zone. The model results support the previously proposed conceptual models for denitrification in riparian aquifers in that enriched delta(15)N, declining DOC, and declining groundwater NO3--N concentrations all occur within a relatively thin (1.5 m) zone. The simulated isotope enrichment factors for selected locations within the model domain range from -2% to -8parts per thousand. and it is noted that these values are significantly lower than the value specified in the model input. This suggests that it would be very difficult to derive accurate isotopic enrichment factors from a limited number of piezometers in such riparian aquifers. Numerical sensitivity analyses show that denitrification can occur at depths as great as 4 m below the ground surface, but the overall nitrate mass removal capacity of the riparian zone will decrease as the groundwater flow system becomes thicker.

AB Quantification of fine root biomass is needed for estimating the role of roots as carbon (C) stores and sources of C input into the soil, as well as for modelling of forest nutrient cycling. Due to the laborious nature of root biomass determinations, there is a need to develop indirect methods that would allow fine root biomass to be estimated using data on easily measurable stand and site variables. We developed models for estimating tree fine root (diameter <= 2 mm) biomass of boreal forests by compiling data from 95 Finnish forest stands (55 on upland soils and 40 on drained peatlands). Stand basal area predicted fine root biomass (R-2-adj. = 0.35, p < 0.001) better than any other stand variable alone. A model that included stand basal area, dominant tree species group [birch/other], soil type [upland soil/drained peatland], temperature sum and the interaction of soil type and temperature sum accounted for 46% of the variation in fine root biomass. Stand basal area, the C:N ratio of the organic layer or upper 0-20 cm peat layer and the dominant tree species group together explained 45% of the variation in fine root biomass. Temperature sum correlated with fine root biomass in opposite ways in upland soils and in drained peatlands: fine root biomass increased with decreasing temperature sum in upland soil sites, whereas in peatlands fine root biomass decreased as the temperature sum decreased. Although the models were based on a large dataset representing well the variation in stand age, basal area, site fertility and climatic conditions in northern European boreal forests, half of the variation in fine root biomass remained unexplained. More comprehensive fine root biomass sampling in relation to spatial and temporal variation in the forthcoming studies, for example in connection with monitoring campaigns, and additional predictors such as soil texture, successional stage and the fine root biomass of ground vegetation might improve the predictive power of fine root biomass models.

AB Agricultural peat soils in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California have been identified as an important source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and trihalomethane precursors in waters exported for drinking. The objectives of this study were to examine the primary sources of DOC from soil profiles (surface vs. subsurface), factors (temperature, soil water content and wet-dry cycles) controlling DOC production, and the relationship between C mineralization and DOC concentration in cultivated peat soils. Surface and subsurface peat soils were incubated for 60 d under a range of temperature (10, 20, and 30 degrees C) and soil water contents (0.3-10.0 g-water g-soil(-1)). Both CO2-C and DOC were monitored during the incubation period. Results showed that significant amount of DOC was produced only in the surface soil under constantly flooded conditions or flooding/non-flooding cycles. The DOC production was independent of temperature and soil water content under non-flooded condition, although CO2 evolution was highly correlated with these parameters. Aromatic carbon and hydrophobic acid contents in surface DOC were increased with wetter incubation treatments. In addition, positive linear correlations (r(2) = 0. 87) between CO2-C mineralization rate and DOC concentration were observed in the surface soil, but negative linear correlations (r(2) = 0.70) were observed in the subsurface soil. Results imply that mineralization of soil organic carbon by microbes prevailed in the subsurface soil. A conceptual model using a kinetic approach is proposed to describe the relationships between CO2-C mineralization rate and DOC concentration in these soils. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Quantification of the black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) components of source emissions is critical to understanding the impact combustion aerosols have on atmospheric light absorption. Multiple-wavelength absorption was measured from fuels including wood, agricultural biomass, coals, plant matter, and petroleum distillates in controlled combustion settings. Filter-based absorption measurements were corrected and compared to photoacoustic absorption results. BC absorption was segregated from the total light extinction to estimate the BrC absorption from individual sources. Results were compared to elemental carbon (EC)/organic carbon (OC) concentrations to determine composition's impact on light absorption. Multiple-wavelength absorption coefficients, Angstrom exponent (6.9 to <1.0), mass absorption cross section (MAC), and Delta C (97 mu gm(-3) to 0 mu gm(-3)) were highly variable. Sources such as incense and peat emissions showed ultraviolet wavelength (370nm) BrC absorption over 175 and 80 times (respectively) the BC absorption but only 21 and 11 times (respectively) at 520nm wavelength. The bulk EC MAC(EC,) (average at 520nm=9.03.7m(2)g(-1); with OC fraction <0.85=7.5m(2)g(-1)) and the BrC OC mass absorption cross sections (MAC(BrC,OC,)) were calculated; at 370nm ultraviolet wavelengths; the MAC(BrC,OC,) ranged from 0.8m(2)g(-1) to 2.29m(2)g(-1) (lowest peat, highest kerosene), while at 520nm wavelength MAC(BrC,OC,) ranged from 0.07m2g(-1) to 0.37m(2)g(-1) (lowest peat, highest kerosene/incense mixture). These MAC results show that OC content can be an important contributor to light absorption when present in significant quantities (>0.9 OC/TC), source emissions have variable absorption spectra, and nonbiomass combustion sources can be significant contributors to BrC.

AB Forest landscapes represent the major land-cover type for the watersheds of the East River, which is the source of water for 40 million people in South China. Forest soils with high levels of organic carbon are a potential terrestrial source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the East River. DOC is of great concern, since it can form carcinogenic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during drinking water treatment. In this study, soils from three altitudes (200, 450 and 900 m) in the Xiangtou Mountain Nature Reserve in South China, representing soils from evergreen moon forest, transitional evergreen broadleaf forest, and evergreen broadleaf forest, respectively, were evaluated for their potential contributions of DBP precursors into the East River. The water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) in three forest soils was physically and chemically fractionated into particulate organic carbon (1.2-0.45 mm), colloidal organic carbon (0.45-0.22 mu m), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (<0.22 mu m), hydrophobic acid (HPOA), transphilic acid and hydrophilic acid and were analysed for the formation potentials of trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetonitriles (HANs), and chloral hydrate (CHD). Also, soils were incubated at 15, 25 and 35 degrees C for 14 d in darkness to examine the impact of temperature effects on the availability and characteristics of WEOC. The extraction study showed that the amount of WEOC was proportional to soil organic carbon content, of which about 1% was water extractable. Regardless of soil type, DOC and HPOA were the most reactive fractions in forming THMs, CHD, and HANs. Production of DOC and HPOA in WEOC increased over 14 d incubation as incubation temperature increased, but the temperature did not alter the distribution of physical and chemical fractions and their reactivity in DBP formation. Results suggest higher inputs of DOC and DBP precursors from forest watersheds into source water may result in a warmer environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The carbon (C) cycle in boreal regions is strongly influenced by fire, which converts biomass and detrital C mainly to gaseous forms (CO2 and smaller proportions of CO and CH4), and some 1-3% of mass to pyrogenic C (PyC). PyC is mainly produced as solid charred residues, including visually-defined charcoal, and a black carbon (BC) fraction chemically defined by its resistance to laboratory oxidation, plus much lower proportions of volatile soot and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). All PyC is characterized by fused aromatic rings, but varying in cluster sizes, and presence of other elements (N, O) and functional groups. The range of PyC structures is often described as a continuum from partially charred plant materials, to charcoal, soot and ultimately graphite which is formed by the combination of heat and pressure. There are several reasons for current interest in defining more precisely the role of PyC in the C cycle of boreal regions. First, PyC is largely resistant to decomposition, and therefore contributes to very stable C pools in soils and sediments. Second, it influences soil processes, mainly through its sorption properties and cation exchange capacity, and third, soot aerosols absorb solar radiation and may contribute to global warming. However, there are large gaps in the basic information needed to address these topics. While charcoal is commonly defined by visual criteria, analytical methods for BC are mainly based on various measures of oxidation resistance, or on yield of benzenepolycarboxylic acids. These methods are still being developed, and capture different fractions of the PyC structural continuum. There are few quantitative reports of PyC production and stocks in boreal forests (essentially none for boreal peatlands), and results are difficult to compare due to varying experimental goals and methods, as well as inconsistent terminology. There are almost no direct field measurements of BC aerosol production from boreal wildfires, and little direct information on rates and mechanisms for PyC loss. Structural characterization of charred biomass and forest floor from wildfires generally indicates a low level of thermal alteration, with the bulk of the material having H/C ratios still > 0.2, and small aromatic cluster sizes. Especially for the more oxidation-resistant BC fraction, a variety of mainly circumstantial evidence suggests very slow decomposition, with turnover on a millennial timescale (in the order of 5-7 ky), also dependent on environmental conditions. However, there is also evidence that some PyC may be lost in only tens to hundreds of years due to a combination of lower thermal alteration and environmental protection. The potential for long-term PyC storage in soil may also be limited by its consumption by subsequent fires. Degraded, functionalized PyC is also incorporated into humified soil organic matter, and is transported eventually to marine sediments in dissolved and particulate form. Boreal production is estimated as 7-17 Tg BC y(-1) of solid residues and 2-2.5 Tg BC y(-1) as aerosols, compared to global estimates of 40-240 and 10-30TgBCy(-1), respectively. Primary research needs include basic field data on PyC production and stocks in boreal forests and peatlands, suitable to support C budget modeling, and development of standardized analytical methods and of improved approaches to assess the chemical recalcitrance of typical chars from boreal wildfires.
   To accomplish these goals effectively will require much greater emphasis on interdiciplinary cooperation.

AB [1] The response of large stores of carbon in boreal forest soils to global warming is a major uncertainty in predicting the future carbon budget. We measured the temperature dependence of decomposition for upland boreal peat under black spruce forest with sphagnum and feather moss understory using incubation experiments. CO2 efflux rates clearly responded to temperature, which ranged from -10degrees to +8degreesC by similar to2degreesC increments. At temperatures below 0degreesC, significant decomposition was observed in feather moss peat but not in wetter sphagnum peat. Above 0degreesC, decomposition was exponentially related to temperature, corresponding to a Q(10) (the ratio of the rate of CO2 evolution at one temperature divided by that at a temperature 10degreesC cooler) of 4.4 for feather moss and 3.1 for sphagnum peat. The greatest change in CO2 evolution rate with temperature occurred between -2degrees and 0degreesC, which coincided with the phase transition of soil water. We saw no large change in the rate of CO2 evolution between incubation experiments separated by a 6 month storage period for feather moss peat. Stable C isotope measurements of evolved CO2 and the rate of change of CO2 evolution with time suggest different substrates are used to sustain heterotrophic respiration above and below freezing. Radiocarbon signatures of CO2 respired from both types of peat reflected significant contributions from C fixed in the last 35 years ("bomb'' C-14) as well as C fixed prior to 1950. We observed no change in the Delta(14)C of respired CO2 with temperature. Isotopic signatures of peat components showed that a combination of substrates must contribute to the CO2 evolved in our incubations. Decomposition of fine roots (which made up less than 7% of the total peat C) accounted for similar to50% of respired CO2 in feather moss peat and for similar to30% of respired CO2 in sphagnum peat. Fine-grained (< 1 mm), more humified material that makes up 60-70% of the bulk peat organic carbon contributed significantly to heterotrophic respiration (similar to 30% in feather moss and similar to 50% in sphagnum moss peat), despite slow decomposition rates. Increased temperatures caused enhanced decomposition from all pools without changing their relative contributions. Because the contribution of peat decomposition is a small portion of total soil respiration at the study site, increased respiration rates would be difficult to measure as increased fluxes in the field. Nonetheless, sustained warming could lead to significant loss of C from these peat layers.

AB Soil carbon and nutrients play vital roles in ecosystem services. Many previous studies documented carbon or nutrient accumulation and the relevant impacting factors, and emphasized the soil physical structure, especially soil aggregates, that might play a key role in grasslands or farmlands. Unfortunately, there is little known about the relationship between soil aggregates and nutrient sequestration in fens and which soil aggregate type contributes most strongly to the soil nutrient cycle in fens. In this study, we collected 180 soil samples from 3 sites and then tested the changes in soil nutrient contents and carbon sequestration rates based on soil aggregate fractions from a fen that has critical implications for temperate wetland ecosystems in Northeast China. This fen soil is obviously characterized with macroaggregate and microaggregate structures. For this soil, the mean weight diameter (MWD) ranged from 0.42 to 0.61 mm and the geometric mean diameter (GMD) ranged from 0.82 to 0.90 mm, and there were fluctuations for both MWD and GMD along with soil depth. The correlation analysis showed that macroaggregates were more closely related to carbon sequestration (p < 0.01) and stable soil microaggregates were important for nutrient conservation (p < 0.01) in this fen. The sequestration rates of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus were 87.64 +/- 10.88 gC m(-2) yr(-1), 3.43 +/- 0.54 gN m(-2) yr(-1), and 0.17 +/- 0.02 gP M-2 yr(-1), respectively. Additionally, the characteristic stoichiometric balance was related to the aggregate size and there were four distinct intervals for both the C/N ratio and C/P ratio; three intervals were located in similar ranges for the C/N ratio and C/P ratio (12-14 cm, 20-22 cm, and 28-30 cm) which means three of these areas coincided with the C/P ratio that characterizes the phosphorus conversion intensity index. The findings indicate that soil aggregates play key roles in soil carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling within wetlands.

AB During the past three decades the Earth has warmed with a rate unprecedented during the past 1000 years. There is already ample evidence that this fast climate warming has affected a broad range of organisms, including plants. Plants from high-latitude and high-altitude sites ('cold biomes') are especially sensitive to climate warming. In this paper we (1) review the response in the phenology of plants, changes in their range and distribution, soil nutrient availability, and the effects on the structure and dynamics of plant communities for cold, northern biomes; and (2) we show, by using data from an ongoing snow and temperature manipulation experiment in northern Sweden, that also winter and spring events have a profound influence on plant performance. Both long-term phenological data sets, experimental warming studies (performed in summer or year-round), natural gradient studies and satellite images show that key phenological events are responsive to temperature increases and that recent climate warming does indeed lead to changes in plant phenology. However, data from a warming and snow manipulation study that we are conducting in northern Sweden show that plants respond differently to the various climatic scenarios that we had imposed on these species and that especially winter and spring events have a profound impact. This indicates that it is necessary to include several scenarios of both summer and winter climate change in experimental climate change studies, and that we need detailed projections of future climate at a regional scale to be able to assess their impacts on natural ecosystems. There is also ample evidence that the range shift of herbs and shrubs to more northern regions is for the vast majority of species mainly caused by changes in the climate. This is in line with the observed 'up-greening' of northern tundra sites. These rapid northern shifts in distribution of plants as a result of climate warming may have substantial consequences for the structure and dynamics of high-latitude ecosystems. An analysis of warming studies at 9 tundra sites shows that heating during at least 3 years increased net N-mineralization from 0.32 +/- 0.31 (SE) g N m(-2) yr(-1) in the controls to 0.53 +/- 0.31 (SE) g N m(2) yr(-1) in the heated plots (p < 0.05), an increase of about 70%. Thus, warming leads to higher N availability in high-latitude northern tundra sites, but the variability is substantial. Higher nutrient availability affects in turn the species composition of high-latitude sites, which has important consequences for the carbon and water balance of these systems.

AB The nearshore shelf of the Beaufort Sea is defined by extreme physical and biological gradients that have a distinctive influence on its productivity and trophic structure. Massive freshwater discharge from the Mackenzie River, along with numerous smaller rivers and streams elsewhere along the coast, produce an environment that is decidedly estuarine in character, especially in late spring and summer. Consequently, the Beaufort coast provides a critical habitat for several species of amphidromous fishes, some of which are essential to the subsistence lifestyle of arctic native populations. Because of its low in situ productivity, allochthonous inputs of organic carbon, identifiable on the basis of isotopic composition, are important to the functioning of this arctic estuarine system. Coastal erosion and river discharge are largely responsible for introducing high concentrations of suspended sediment from upland regions into the nearshore zone. The depletion in the C-13 content of invertebrate and vertebrate consumers, which drops about 4-5 parts per thousand eastward along the eastern Alaskan Beaufort Sea coast, may reflect the assimilation of this terrestrial organic matter into local food webs. In addition, the large range in C-13 values of fauna collected in the eastern Beaufort (nearly 8 parts per thousand) compared to the same species in the northeastern Chukchi (3 parts per thousand), indicate a lower efficiency of carbon transfer between trophic levels in the eastern Beaufort. The wider spread in stable isotope values in the eastern Beaufort may also reflect a decoupling between benthic and pelagic components. Isotopic tracer studies of amphidromous fishes in the Simpson Island barrier island lagoon revealed that terrestrial (peat) carbon may contribute as much as 30-500% of their total dietary requirements. On the eastern Alaska Beaufort Sea coast, the delta C-13 values of arctic cod collected in semi-enclosed lagoons were more depleted, by 3-4 parts per thousand, compared to fish collected in the coastal Beaufort Sea. Calculations from isotopic mixing equations indicate cod from lagoons may derive 70% of their carbon from terrestrial sources. The delta N-15 values of lagoon fish were also 4 parts per thousand lower than coastal specimens, reflective of the lower delta N-15 values of terrestrially derived nitrogen (0-1.5 parts per thousand compared to 5-7 parts per thousand for phytoplankton). The role of terrestrial carbon in arctic estuarine food webs is especially important in view of the current warming trend in the arctic environment and the role of advective processes that transport carbon along the nearshore shelf. Biogeochemical studies of the arctic coastal estuarine environment may provide more insights into the function of these biologically complex ecosystems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Advective flows of seawater and fresh groundwater through coastal aquifers form a unique ecohydrological interface, the subterranean estuary (STE). Here, freshly produced marine organic matter and oxygen mix with groundwater, which is low in oxygen and contains aged organic carbon (OC) from terrestrial sources. Along the groundwater flow paths, dissolved organic matter (DOM) is degraded and inorganic electron acceptors are successively used up. Because of the different DOM sources and ages, exact degradation pathways are often difficult to disentangle, especially in highenergy environments with dynamic changes in beach morphology, source composition, and hydraulic gradients. From a case study site on a barrier island in the German North Sea, we present detailed biogeochemical data from freshwater lens groundwater, seawater, and beach porewater samples collected over different seasons. The samples were analyzed for physico-chemistry (e.g., salinity, temperature, dissolved silicate), (reduced) electron acceptors (e.g., oxygen, nitrate, and iron), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). DOM was isolated and molecularly characterized via soft-ionization ultra high-resolution mass spectrometry, and molecular formulae were identified in each sample. We found that the islands' freshwater lens harbors a surprisingly high DOM molecular diversity and heterogeneity, possibly due to patchy distributions of buried peat lenses. Furthermore, a comparison of DOM composition of the endmembers indicated that the Spiekeroog high-energy beach STE conveys chemically modified, terrestrial DOM from the inland freshwater lens to the coastal ocean. In the beach intertidal zone, porewater DOC concentrations, lability of DOM and oxygen concentrations, decreased while dissolved (reduced) iron and dissolved silicate concentrations increased. This observation is consistent with the assumption of a continuous degradation of labile DOM along a cross-shore gradient, even in this dynamic environment. Accordingly, molecular properties of DOM indicated enhanced degradation, and "humic-like" fluorescent DOM fraction increased along the flow paths, likely through accumulation of compounds less susceptible to microbial consumption. Our data indicate that the high-energy beach STE is likely a net sink of OC from the terrestrial and marine realm, and that barrier islands such as Spiekeroog may act as efficient "digestors" of organic matter.

AB Natural riparian forest wetlands are known to be effective in their ability to remove nitrate by denitrification and sediments with attached phosphorus via sedimentation. On the other hand, litter input and decomposition is a process of crucial importance in cycling of nitrogen and phosphorus in a forest ecosystem.
   In this study we investigated the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus entering the alder fen ecosystem through leaf litter and its decomposition and the removal capacity of nitrogen and phosphorus by measuring denitrification and sedimentation in the alder fen.
   We found an average input of leaf litter during fall 1998 of 226 g m(-2) yr(-1) DW with nutrient concentration of 0.17% P and 1.6% N. This means a yearly input of 0.4 g m(-2) yr(-1) P and 3.6 g m(-2) yr(-1) N. The decomposition of leaf litter using litter bags with small and large mesh size resulted in bags with macroinvertebrates (large mesh size) and without macroinvertebrates (small mesh size). After 57 days the litter bags with macroinvertebrates had a decomposition rate of 79%.
   Denitrification was measured in May and June of 1997 using the acetylene inhibition technique on intact soil cores and slurry-experiments. The average annual denitrification rate was 0.2 g m(-2) yr(-1) N using data from the core experiments. The denitrification rate was higher after addition of nitrate, indicating that denitrification in the riparian alder fen is mainly controlled by nitrate supply.
   The sedimentation rate in the investigated alder fen ranged from 0.47 kg m(-2) yr(-1) DW to 4.46 kg m(-2) yr(-1) DW in 1998 depending on the study site and method we used. Sedimentation rates were lower in newly designed plate traps than in cylinder traps. The alder fen also showed lower rates than the adjacent creek Briese. Average phosphorus removal rate was 0.33 g m(-2) yr(-1) P.
   Input sources for the surface water of the alder fen are sediment mineralization and decomposition of leaf litter; output sources are sedimentation and denitrification. This study showed that a nutrient input of 24.58 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) N, 8.8 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) P and 419 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) DOC into the surface water of the alder fen is possible. Alder fens cannot improve water quality of an adjacent river system. This is only true for a nearly pristine alder fen with the hydrology of 10 months flooded conditions and 2 months non-flooding conditions a year.

AB Aim To reassess the capacity of mangroves for ecosystem services in the light of recent data. Location Global mangrove ecosystems. Methods We review four long-standing roles of mangroves: (1) carbon dynamics - export or sink; (2) nursery role; (3) shoreline protection; (4) land-building capacity. The origins of pertinent hypotheses, current understanding and gaps in our knowledge are highlighted with reference to biogeographic, geographic and socio-economic influences. Results The role of mangroves as C sinks needs to be evaluated for a wide range of biogeographic regions and forest conditions. Mangrove C assimilation may be under-estimated because of flawed methodology and scanty data on key components of C dynamics. Peri-urban mangroves may be manipulated to provide local offsets for C emission. The nursery function of mangroves is not ubiquitous but varies with spatio-temporal accessibility. Connectivity and complementarity of mangroves and adjacent habitats enhance their nursery function through trophic relay and ontogenetic migrations. The effectiveness of mangroves for coastal protection depends on factors at landscape/geomorphic to community scales and local/species scales. Shifts in species due to climate change, forest degradation and loss of habitat connectivity may reduce the protective capacity of mangroves. Early views of mangroves as land builders (especially lateral expansion) were questionable. Evidence now indicates that mangroves, once established, directly influence vertical land development by enhancing sedimentation and/or by direct organic contributions to soil volume (peat formation) in some settings. Main conclusions Knowledge of thresholds, spatio-temporal scaling and variability due to geographic, biogeographic and socio-economic settings will improve the management of mangrove ecosystem services. Many drivers respond to global trends in climate change and local changes such as urbanization. While mangroves have traditionally been managed for subsistence, future governance models must involve partnerships between local custodians of mangroves and offsite beneficiaries of the services.

AB In an attempt to determine to what extent the impact of recent climate changes that occurred east of Hudson Bay, including important reduction of areas in permafrost, had on the coastal marine environment, a series of shallow cores were extracted from the seabed off the mouth of the Sheldrake River, in Nastapoka Sound. A total of 25 cores were taken in April 2009 from the ice cover. A preliminary seafloor map was first done to help in the selection of the coring sites. Nastapoka Sound has a complex subaqueous relief, formed of asymmetric ridges and deep basins. After preliminary sedimentological analyses, six of the cores were selected for physical and chronological analyses (C-14, Pb-210, and Cs-137 dating); among them, three were selected for elemental (C, N, OC/TN) and isotopic (delta C-13, delta N-15) analyses to identify sedimentary organic matter sources. Sedimentation processes are complex and are primarily driven by bottom currents. This is confirmed by the absence of a clay fraction in several cores, some erosion surfaces in a few cores, and the presence of comet-like mark features on the seafloor. The highest sedimentation rates are found near the coast of the province of Quebec and Gillies Island and the lowest ones occur in the deep depocenters. Isotopic and elemental analyses reveal that Nastapoka Sound is an area of mixing between marine and terrestrial inputs and can be compared to an estuarine system similar to nearby Lac Guillaume-Delisle. Those conditions altogether make it difficult to extract a perfectly clear signal of climate change in the recent sediment record. However, the downcore application of a simple two end-member mixing model to measured delta C-13 values strongly suggests that the fraction of sedimentary organic matter from terrestrial sources increased by 30% since about the middle of the Little Ice Age. This trend accelerated at the end of the 20th century. Rapid permafrost decay in adjacent river catchments is likely one source for this terrestrial carbon. However, it cannot be distinguished from other potential sources that are also related to environmental changes such as increase in primary productivity both on land, where peatlands, shrubs, and forest are expanding, and at sea, where sea ice cover duration is diminishing.

AB Cropland fires are an important source of black carbon (BC) emissions. Previous research has suggested that springtime cropland burning in Eastern Europe, more specifically Russia, is a main contributor of BC in the Arctic atmosphere, acting as a short-lived climate forcer strongly influencing snow-ice albedo and radiation transmission. BC emissions from cropland burning were estimated for the Russian Federation for years 2003 through 2009 using three satellite fire products, the 1 km MODIS Active Fire Product, 0.5 degrees MODIS Fire Radiative Power monthly climate modeling grid product, and the 500 m MODIS Burned Area Product, and a agricultural statistics approach based on a modified method developed and published by the All-Russian Institute of Organic Peat and Fertilizers to estimate farm- and regional-level residue loading from straw surplus left after grain harvesting, while accounting for agricultural management and agrometeorological inputs. The satellite-based emission calculations utilized several different land cover classification schemas for defining croplands in Russia for both the 1 km MODIS Land Cover Product and the 300 m MERIS GlobCover v2.2 data sets. In general, the peaks of BC emissions from cropland burning occurred during the spring (April-May), summer (July-August), and the fall (October). 2008 had the highest annual BC emissions. The range of average annual BC emissions from cropland burning calculated from the different satellite fire products was 2.49 Gg-22.2 Gg, with the agricultural statistics approach annual average equal to 8.90 Gg. The Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) version 3 reported an annual average of 11.9 Gg of BC from agricultural burning. The results from this analysis showed that the majority of BC emissions originated in European Russia, followed by smaller contributions from West Siberia, Far East Russia, and East Siberia macro-regions. An uncertainty assessment on data used to calculate the BC emissions found moderate uncertainty in some of the input data used in this first attempt to produce spatially and temporally explicit BC emission estimates from cropland burning in the Russian Federation.

AB Soil freeze-thaw cycles in the winter-cold zone can substantially affect soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, and deserve special consideration in wetlands of cold climates. Semi-disturbed soil columns from three natural wetlands (Carex marsh, Carex marshy meadow and Calamagrostis wet grassland) and a soybean field that has been reclaimed from a wetland were exposed to seven freeze thaw cycles. The freeze-thaw treatments were performed by incubating the soil columns at -10 degrees C for 1 d and at 5 degrees C for 7 d. The control columns were incubated at 5 degrees C for 8 d. After each freeze-thaw cycle, the soil solution was extracted by a solution extractor installed in each soil layer of the soil column, and was analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), NH4+-N, NO3--N and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP). The results showed that freeze thaw cycles could increase DOC, NH4+-N and NO3--N concentrations in soil solutions, and decrease TDP concentrations. Moreover, the changes of DOC, NH4+-N, NO3--N and TDP concentrations in soil solutions caused by freeze thaw cycles were different in various sampling sites and soil layers. The increments of DOC concentrations caused by freeze thaw cycles were greater in the wetland soil columns than in the soybean field soil columns. The increments of NH4+-N concentrations caused by freeze thaw cycles decreased with the increase of soil depth. The depth variation in the increments of NO3--N concentrations caused by freeze thaw cycles in the wetland soil columns was different from that in the soybean field soil columns. The decrements of TDP concentrations caused by freeze thaw cycles were greater in columns of Carex marsh and Carex marshy meadow than in columns of Calamagrostis wet grassland and the soybean field. The study results provide information on the timing of nutrient release related to freezing and thawing in natural versus agronomic soils, and have implications for the timing of nutrient application in farm fields in relation to water quality protection.

AB 1. Boreal headwater streams typically receive large contributions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from wetland and forest soils and can exhibit high CO2 effluxes, but little is known about how stream biofilm respiration of DOM responds to carbon and nutrient substrates in boreal catchments.
   2. The aim of this study was to assess (i) the response of heterotrophic biofilms to increased availability of labile carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and (ii) how this response varies across sites differing in the source of catchment organic matter.
   3. Normalised biofilm respiration rates (R-Biofilm) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of DOM sources derived from wetland, deciduous forest and ponds were up to 10 times greater than for coniferous forest DOM. Experimental additions of bog- and pond-derived DOM stimulated R-Biofilm in coniferous forest sites (1.5-2.5 times), adding further weight to the evidence for differing responses to stream DOM sources in this boreal catchment.
   4. Mineralisation of added glucose by the biofilms was only increased by added N and P, coinciding with a reduction in mineralisation of the extant stream DOM. These findings suggest that increases in labile C, N and P can reduce biofilm mineralisation of stream dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus, perhaps due to the greater energy required to access the more complex DOM.
   5. In 15 of 19 experiments, the addition of glucose had no effect on biofilm mineralisation of stream DOC (R-DOC). In the presence of added N and P, however, R-DOC decreased by 30 to 38% with the addition of glucose at sites with the most active biofilms in summer. When glucose was added alone, conversely, R-DOC was stimulated (40-50%) at these same sites in autumn, when biofilm respiration was lower and DOM more aromatic and less carbohydrate-rich. Combined, these results suggest labile C sources, such as algal exudates, may (i) compete as a source of energy and/or stimulate the incorporation rather than mineralisation of the more N- and P-rich stream DOM or (ii) stimulate the mineralisation of stream DOM, potentially depending upon nutrient availability and the composition of stream DOM.

AB Organic soils are the most important source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in surface water. To date, most studies have focused on natural and re -wetted peatlands, but in Central Europe a large proportion of organic soils are drained and under agricultural use. Furthermore, measures such as deep ploughing or sand addition have been conducted to improve trafficability and have resulted in topsoil horizons consisting of a peat -sand mixture. Very little is known about DOC losses" from such soils. Moreover, peat soils frequently feature both mobile zones, characterised by active water and solute transport, and immobile zones, which.exchange solutes with the mobile zone by diffusion. Surprisingly, however, the effects of this dual porosity on DOC transport have not yet been explored. This study investigated the physicochemical controls on DOC concentrations in a peat -sand mixture by means of a saturated column experiment with undisturbed columns. The soil came from a former bog in northern Germany where peat layers remaining after peat extraction were mixed with the underlying mineral soil by ploughing. Three pumping rates and two levels of electrical conductivity (EC) were applied. The transport properties of the soil were obtained by analysing breakthrough curves of potassium bromide using the transport model STANMOD, which is based on the two -region non -equilibrium concept. The results of the column study were compared to DOC concentrations measured bi-weekly for two years at the field site from where the columns were taken. Despite a similar texture and soil organic carbon (SOC) content, the fraction of the mobile zone in the columns varied between 51% and 100% of total porosity. Thus even heavily degraded organic soils mixed with sand still showed a dual porosity comparable to degraded peat soils. Percolating the columns with the high EC solution caused low pH values, probably due to ion exchange and cation bridging. The combination of high EC and low pH greatly decreased DOC concentrations at the outlet of the columns. DOC concentrations decreased and fluxes increased as the pumping rates increased. Taking pore water velocity in the mobile zone into account could help to explain the differences between the columns. Overall, transport of DOC did not seem to be limited by production of DOC, but by rate -limited exchange processes. In contrast to the column experiment, field concentrations of DOC were much higher and were not related to pH, but increased with higher electrical conductivity. These higher concentrations could be explained by low pore water velocities and the slightly higher SOC content in the field. This first experiment on DOC transport in peat -sand mixtures taking the dual -porosity nature of organic soils into account clearly demonstrated the importance of pore water velocity and thus the residence time for DOC concentrations. While hydrochemical conditions are frequently addressed in laboratory studies, there is a need for improved understanding of their interaction with hydrology and soil physical properties, especially when attempting to interpret DOC data on different spatial and temporal scales.(C) 2017 The Author(s).

AB The reserves and fluxes of carbon in ecosystems of the circumpolar tundra biome should be among the most responsive to climatic change, including their transformation from a CO2 sink to a CO2 source with respect to the atmosphere. To estimate accurately the significance of Arctic tundra to global carbon stocks and balances, quantitative geographically referenced estimates of the masses and fluxes of carbon are needed. Although new empirically based estimates of reserves and productivity were recently obtained for the Eurasian part of the tundra biome using GIS technology, the figures currently used for carbon reserves and productivity of the North American tundra ecosystems are based on earlier expert estimates or large scale models based on data primarily for non-tundra areas. To obtain new more empirically based estimates of the reserves and fluxes of carbon in North American tundra ecosystems a set of records of North American tundra ecosystems was obtained from the Global Arctic/Alpine Climate/Soil/Plant Productivity Data Base (Global Change Research Group, San Diego State University). This data base contains phytomass, productivity, climatic and soil characteristics for nearly fifty tundra-type ecosystems studied during the past 30 years in Alaska and Northern Canada. This information was used to interpolate the necessary data for all the tundra cells (1 X 1 degree) of the simple GIS, based on the Global Vegetation Map and the FAO/UNESCO Soil Map of the World. By integrating the corresponding maps of phytomass and productivity the quantitative estimates of the reserves and. productivity fluxes of organic matter in tundra ecosystems of North America and Greenland (4.12 x 10(6) km(2) total area) were obtained: 2.26 Gt above-ground phytomass, 4.99 Gt total phytomass, 91.3 Gt soil organic matter of the active layer; 0.56 Gt/yr above-ground net primary production; 0.98 Gt/yrotal net primary production. As an alternative means of determining the productivity totals for North American tundra ecosystems, the phenomenological model of the form: NPP=f(T,H,G), relating net primary production of tundra ecosystems to climatic, soil and vegetation factors, was applied to the GIS layers of mean annual temperature (T), soil organic matter content (H), and above-ground phytomass density (G) to produce a map of modelled NPP estimates for North American tundra ecosystems. The subroutine of spatial integration of the local production estimates takes into account geographical changes in the landscape composition (proportions of the zonal, meadow, mire and aquatic ecosystem types) and results in totals of 0.58 Gt/yr for above-ground and 1.16 Gt/yr for total net primary production of tundra ecosystems of North America and Greenland.

AB Saltmarshes provide important services including flood control, climate regulation, and provisioning services when grazed by livestock for agriculture and conservation purposes. Grazing diminishes aboveground carbon, creating a trade-off between these two services. Furthermore, saltmarshes are threatened by overgrazing. To provide saltmarsh protection and ensure the continuing delivery of ecosystem services, there is a need to incentivise land managers to stock environmentally sensible densities. We therefore investigated the possibility of agri-environmental schemes and Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) to compensate for lost livestock revenue under reduced grazing regimes and provide carbon sequestration and other benefits. This is the first study to consider the benefits arising from a potential carbon market to saltmarshes, although similar schemes exist for peatland and woodland. We calculated the net economic benefit (costs of livestock production are removed from revenue) to farmers obtained from a hectare of grazed saltmarsh under low (0.3 Livestock Units per hectare per year), moderate (0.6), high (1.0) and very high (2.0) stocking densities accounting for livestock revenue, carbon benefits, and agri-environmental subsidies. We repeated the procedure considering additional benefits transferred from the literature in terms of provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services provided by protected saltmarshes. The net benefits were assessed for a range of market carbon prices and social costs of carbon, e.g. the opportunity cost of carbon for society. Applying the model to Scottish saltmarshes we find that the current range of market prices could prompt transitions from high to moderate regimes in areas where livestock value is low, however break-even prices for transitions showed high spatial variability due to spatial variability in livestock values. In some areas of the West Highlands, the break-even carbon price is negative, indicating that the current agri-environmental schemes are able to more than compensate for the lost revenue accruing to farmers by a reduced grazing density. However, in other areas, such as the Outer Hebrides, the breakeven carbon price is positive. Private PES schemes or increased public subsidies should then be provided to generate net benefits. It is reasonable to infer that a pure carbon market may have limited scope in incentivising consumers to buy carbon services, especially in areas with limited local number of buyers and corporates of small size. Under this circumstance, a premium carbon market offering bundled ecosystem services may help reduce grazing pressure across a larger number of Scottish saltmarshes, thereby providing globally important climate regulation services and at the same time protecting sensitive habitats.

AB This study reports the combined major, minor and trace element compositions, and stable (C, O), radiogenic (Nd, Pb, and Sr) isotopic compositions, and first delta B-11 isotopic data for the Fir, Felix, Gum, and Howard Creek carbonatites from the Blue River Region, British Columbia (Canada). These sill-like occurrences were intruded into Late Proterozoic strata during rifting and extensional episodes during the Late Cambrian and Devonian -Mississippian, and subsequently deformed and metamorphosed to amphibolite grade in relation to a collisional type tectonic environment. The carbonatites at Fir, Gum, and Felix contain both calcite and dolomite, whereas the carbonatite at Howard Creek contains only calcite. The dolomite compositions reported here are consistent with those experimentally determined by direct partial melting of metasomatized peridotitic mantle. The combined major and trace element compositions and delta C-13(PDB) (-5.37 to-4.85 parts per thousand) and delta O-18(SMOW) (9.14 to 9.62 parts per thousand) values for all the samples investigated are consistent with those for primary igneous carbonate and support their mantle origin. However, these signatures cannot be attributed to closed system melt differentiation from a single parental melt. The initial Nd, Pb, and Sr isotopic ratios are highly variable and suggest generation from multiple, small degree parental melts derived from a heterogeneous mantle source. The delta B-11 values for carbonates from Felix, Gum, and Howard Creek vary between -8.67 and -6.36 parts per thousand, and overlap the range for asthenospheric mantle (-7.1 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand), whereas two samples from Fir yield heavier values of -3.98 and -2.47 parts per thousand. The latter indicate the presence of recycled crustal carbon in their mantle source region, which is consistent with those for young (< 300 Ma) carbonatites worldwide. The radiogenic and B isotope results for the Blue River carbonatites are compared to those from contrasting, anorogenic tectonic settings at Chipman Lake, Fen, and Jacupiranga, and indicate that similar upper mantle sources are being tapped for carbonatite melt generation. The pristine, mantle-like delta B-11 values reported here for the Blue River carbonatites clearly demonstrate that this isotope system is robust and was not perturbed by post-solidification tectono-metamorphic events. This observation indicates that B isotope signatures are a valuable tool for deciphering the nature of the upper mantle sources for carbonates of igneous origin.

AB The application of stable isotopes is an approach to identify pathways of methanogenesis, methane (CH4) oxidation and transport in peatlands. We measured the stable C isotopic characteristics (delta C-13) of CH4 in peat profiles below hummocks, lawns and hollows of a Finnish mire to study the patterns of CH4 turnover. Porewater CH4 concentrations ([CH4]; at 0.5-2 m) increased with depth below all microforms. Emissions of CH4 from hummocks were the lowest, and increased with the increasing water-saturated zone, being similar to 10 times higher from hollows. Thus, the microtopography of the peatland did not affect the porewater [CH4] in the water-saturated part of the peat profile, but the CH4 emissions were affected due to differences in the oxidative potential of the microforms. There was a decrease in delta C-13-CH4 with depth below all microforms indicating dominance of CO2-reduction over acetate cleavage pathway of methanogenesis at deep peat layers. However, estimated potential portions of transported CH4 comprised 50%-70% of the delta C-13-CH4 enrichment on microforms at the 0.5-m depth, hereby masking the acetate cleavage pathway of methanogenesis. Stable C composition (delta C-13) of CH4 proved to be a suitable (but not sufficient) tool to differentiate between types of methanogenesis in continuously water-saturated layers below microforms of a peatland. Combined flux-based and multi-isotopic approaches are needed to better understand the CH4 turnover process.

AB The sorption capacity of soil organic matter (SOM) for hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs) is affected by various environmental factors, such as soil water saturation and drying. In this study, we used passive sampling to investigate the changes in the sorption capacity of SOM during a drying-wetting cycle using batch sorption experiments. Dried and non-dried peat mosses were used to observe the effect of the drying process on the sorption capacity of SOM at various levels of water saturation in soil pores. At soil with non-dried peat moss, the partition coefficient between the sampler and the soil (K-sampler/soil) slightly increased with decreasing water saturation. At soil with dried peat moss, however, there were almost no differences in the K-sampler/soil among different water saturations except for 100%. The soil organic carbon-water distribution coefficients (K-OC) for dried peat moss were consistently larger than those for non-dried peat moss at all water saturation levels. However, the K-OC values obtained at 100% water saturation for both non-dried and dried peat mosses differed only by 18-29%. For fluoranthene, there was only an 18% difference between the two K-OC values at 100% water saturation, whereas it was 91% at 10% water saturation. This finding suggests that wetting SOM returns mostly its sorption capacity for HOCs after the increase in K-OC caused by extreme drying. The range in sorption capacity obtained in this study showed the resilient margin of the sorption capacity of SOM for HOCs according to microclimatic changes that would occur constantly under environmental conditions.

TI Relationship between electrical conductivity and water content of peat

AB The application of electrical resistivity tomography to peatlands supports conventional coring by providing data on the current condition of peatlands, including data on stratigraphy, peat properties and thickness of organic deposits. Data on the current condition of drained peatlands are particularly required to improve estimates of carbon storage as well as losses and emissions from agriculturally used peatlands. However, most of the studies focusing on electrical resistivity tomography surveys have been conducted on natural peatlands with higher groundwater levels. Peatlands drained for agriculture have not often been studied using geophysical techniques. Drained sites are characterized by low groundwater levels and high groundwater fluctuations during the year, which lead to varying levels of water saturation. To validate better electrical resistivity tomography surveys of drained peatlands, the aim of this laboratory study is to investigate the influence of varying water saturation levels on electrical conductivity (reciprocal of resistivity) for a variety of peat and gyttja types, as well as for different degrees of peat decomposition. Results show that different levels of water saturation strongly influence bulk electrical conductivity. Distinct differences in this relationship exist between peat and gyttja substrates and between different degrees of peat decomposition. Peat shows an exponential relationship for all degrees of decomposition, whereas gyttja, in particular organic-rich gyttja, is characterized by a rather unimodal relationship. The slopes for the relationship between electrical conductivity and water content are steeper at high degrees of decomposition than for peat of low degrees of decomposition. These results have direct implications for field electrical resistivity tomography surveys. In drained peatlands that are strongly susceptible to drying, electrical resistivity tomography surveys have a high potential to monitor the actual field water content. In addition, at comparable water saturations, high or low degrees of decomposition can be inferred from electrical conductivity.

SO OCEANOLOGY

AB Recording seismic signals on the bottom is accompanied by specific distortions caused by resonance phenomena. In the literature, such distortions are explained by the natural vibration of the heavy housing of a seismometer on a soft elastic sediment layer. Meanwhile, there are experimental results that contradict this model. In the present paper, we consider the rheological properties of the bottom sediments, which in fact were not taken into account previously. The model of a viscoplastic medium was used (the Bingham model), and the parameters of the model were experimentally determined. The estimates show that, in the frequency range from 0.003 to 30 Hz used in broadband bottom seismology, the effect of the mass of the seismometer on the results of recording on a soft bottom is negligible. Large errors can be introduced only when a seismometer is placed on rubberlike media such as peat soil, algae aggregations, etc. Resonance phenomena in recording signals on the bottom can occur when seismic waves propagate through a layer of water-saturated sediments. These phenomena are more pronounced for shear waves, whereas the distortions of the longitudinal waves propagating through the water- saturated layer are relatively weak.

TI EFFECT OF WATER SATURATION IN SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER ON THE PARTITION OF

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SORPTION; VAPORS
AB The sorption of benzene, trichloroethylene, and carbon tetrachloride at room temperature from water solution and from vapor on two high-organic-content soils (peat and muck) was determined in order to evaluate the effect of water saturation on the solute partition in soil organic matter (SOM). The uptake of water vapor was similarly determined to define the amounts of water in the saturated soil samples. In such high-organic-content soils the organic vapor sorption and the respective solute sorption from water exhibit linear isotherms over a wide range of relative concentrations. This observation, along with the low BET surface areas of the samples, suggests that partition in the SOM of the samples is the dominant process in the uptake of these liquids. A comparison of the sorption from water solution and from vapor phase shows that water saturation reduces the sorption (partition) efficiency of SOM by approximately 42%; the saturated water content is approximately 38% by weight of dry SOM. This reduction is relatively small when compared with the almost complete suppression by water of organic compound adsorption on soil minerals. While the effect of water saturation on solute uptake by SOM is much expected in terms of solute partition in SOM, the influence of water on the solubility behavior of polar SOM can be explained only qualitatively by regular solution theory. The results suggest that the major effect of water in a drying-wetting cycle on the organic compound uptake by normal low-organic-content soils (and the associated compound's activity) is the suppression of adsorption by minerals rather than the mitigation of the partition effect in SOM.

TI Characterization of diffusivity-based oxygen transport in Arctic organic

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID GAS; COEFFICIENT; PERMEABILITY
AB Arctic terrestrial ecosystems are characterized by large deposits of near-surface soil organic carbon in poorly drained areas. Recent changes in Arctic regions such as warming and changes in water balance have adverse effects on the dynamics of near-surface oxygen, leading to a potential increase in oxidation of near-surface carbon and emission of CO2. This study investigated oxygen diffusivity characteristics, in both gaseous and liquid phases, in the upper 10 cm of an organic soil profile from a peatland in Disko, West Greenland (69 degrees N). Two commonly used methods for calculating diffusivity of gaseous-phase oxygen were applied and discussed to select the most appropriate method for highly porous media, for example peat soil. We measured diffusivity of gaseous-phase oxygen with a one-chamber diffusion set-up in soil at different air contents (mimicking draining), and described it numerically with a previously developed parametric diffusivity model. We obtained precise measurements of liquid-phase oxygen diffusivity along a depth profile (0-2 cm) in water-saturated peat soil with a diffusivity microsensor coupled to a micromanipulator. The results show that the choice of an appropriate diffusivity model is critical for predicting oxygen diffusivity in organic soil and that diffusivity in mineral soil is not representative for organic soil. Furthermore, the importance of the non-linear functionality between water saturation and diffusivity is demonstrated. This highlights the importance of measuring and modelling oxygen diffusivity rather than relying on measurements of observed water content in future studies of CO2 and CH4 dynamics in Arctic soil systems subject to climate changes.

AB Transport of nutrients, CO2, methane, and oxygen plays an important ecological role at the surface of wetland ecosystems. A possibly important transport mechanism in a water-saturated peat moss layer (usually Sphagnum cuspidatum) is nocturnal buoyancy flow, the downward flow of relatively cold surface water, and the upward flow of warm water induced by nocturnal cooling. Mathematical stability analysis showed that buoyancy flow occurs in a cooling porous layer if the system's Rayleigh number (Ra) exceeds 25. For a temperature difference of 10 K between day and night, a typical Ra value for a peat moss layer is 80, which leads to quickly developing buoyancy cells. Numerical simulation demonstrated that fluid flow leads to a considerable mixing of water. Temperature measurements in a cylindrical peat sample of 50-cm height and 35-cm diameter were in agreement with the theoretical results. The nocturnal flow and the associated mixing of the water represent a mechanism for solute transport in water-saturated parts of peat land and in other types of terrestrializing vegetation. This mechanism may be particularly important in continental wetlands, where Ra values in summer are often much larger than the threshold for fluid flow.

AB A mechanistic understanding of carbon (C) sequestration and methane (CH4) production is of great interest due to the importance of these processes for the global C budget. Here we demonstrate experimentally, by means of column experiments, that burial of water saturated, anoxic bog peat leads to inactivation of anaerobic respiration and methanogenesis. This effect can be related to the slowness of diffusive transport of solutes and evolving energetic constraints on anaerobic respiration. Burial lowered decomposition constants in homogenized peat sand mixtures from about 10(-5) to 10(-7) yr(-1), which is considerably slower than previously assumed, and methanogenesis slowed down in a similar manner. The latter effect could be related to acetoclastic methanogenesis approaching a minimum energy quantum of -25 kJ mol(-1) (CH4). Given the robustness of hydraulic properties that locate the oxic-anoxic boundary near the peatland surface and constrain solute transport deeper into the peat, this effect has likely been critical for building the peatland C store and will continue supporting long-term C sequestration in northern peatlands even under moderately changing climatic conditions.

AB Laboratory columns wider continuous flow were packed with peat from the catotelm of an ombrotrophic    bog to simulate the natural environment. Methane concentration increased from 1.4 to 47.8 mumol ml-1 due to anaerobic microbial degradation of the peat, while at the same time the water flow rate decreased from log -1.39 to -3.03 cm3 s-1 and the moisture content decreased from 85.7 to 56.6%. A control column sterilized by irradiation produced carbon dioxide, but, as the flow of water washed this soluble gas out of the column, the hydraulic conductivity and moisture content increased These two results suggest that it is the volume of the gas (in the gas phase within the bog) that controls the hydraulic conductivity of peat bogs. Volume accounting at the end of the experiment showed no gas in rhe sterilized column but 17% gas by volume in the microbially active column. We suggest that as gas bubbles occlude the interstitial pores of the peat the water flow is impeded, reducing both the hydraulic conductivity and the water saturation. The difficulty experienced in draining peat bogs is due to this occlusion, which is also responsible for the heightened water table found in raised bogs. Although methane is produced in bogs, only very low levels of methane emission have been reported Thus the methane released from northern areas will only significantly contribute to increasing radiative gases in the atmosphere if the bogs themselves are disturbed, for example by mining, when the entrapped methane is released, the water table falls, and the bog dries out.

AB Denitrification (N2 production) and oxygen consumption rates were measured at ambient field nitrate concentrations during summer in sediments from eight wetlands (mixed hardwood swamps, cedar swamps, heath dominated shrub wetland, herbaceous peatland, and a wetland lacking live vegetation) and two streams. The study sites included wetlands in undisturbed watersheds and in watersheds with considerable agricultural and/or sewage treatment effluent input. Denitrification rates measured in intact cores of water-saturated sediment ranged from less-than-or-equal-to 20 to 260 mumol N m-2 h-1 among the three undisturbed wetlands and were less variable (180 to 260 mumol N m-2 h-1) among the four disturbed wetlands. Denitrification rates increased when nitrate concentrations in the overlying water were increased experimentally (1 up to 770 muM), indicating that nitrate was an important factor controlling denitrification rates. However, rates of nitrate uptake from the overlying water were not a good predictor of denitrification rates because nitrification in the sediments also supplied nitrate for denitrification. Regardless of the dominant vegetation, pH, or degree of disturbance, denitrification rates were best correlated with sediment oxygen consumption rates (r2 = 0.912) indicating a relationship between denitrification and organic matter mineralization and/or sediment nitrification rates. Rates of denitrification in the wetland sediments were similar to those in adjacent stream sediments. Rates of denitrification in these wetlands were within the range of rates previously reported for water-saturated wetland sediments and flooded soils using whole core N-15 techniques that quantify coupled nitrification/denitrification, and were higher than rates reported from aerobic (non-saturated) wetland sediments using acetylene block methods.

AB Relationships between carbon (C) production and nitrogen (N) mineralization were investigated in two alpine wetland soils of the Tibetan Plateau using laboratory incubation under different temperatures (5, 15, 25, and 35 degrees C) and water saturation (noninundation and inundation). A significant positive relationship was found between CO2 production and N mineralization under increasing temperatures from 5 to 35 degrees C with the same water saturation condition in the marsh soil (r(2) > 0.491 P < 0.0001) and the peat soil (r(2) > 0.38, P < 0.002), and a negative relationship with water saturation increasing at the same temperature, especially 25 and 35 degrees C, in the marsh soil (r(2) > 0.70, P < 0.009) and the peat soil (r(2) > 0.61: P < 0.013). In conclusion, temperatures and water saturation could regulate the relationship between CO2 production and net N mineralization in the Tibetan alpine marsh and peat soils.

AB We studied methanogen activity-measured by in vitro methane production potential and by detection of the messenger RNA (mRNA) of a functional gene-in two boreal fens under high and deep water table (WT) level conditions resulting from a rainy growing season and a dry growing season. The depth of the highest CH4-producing layers differed between the years. In the wet year, the highest CH4 production rate was around 20 cm below the mean WT. In the dry year, the highest rates were measured close to the peat surface, well above the mean WT. The distribution of activity in the peat profiles of the two fens appeared to be site specific. Under deep-WT conditions, CH4 production potential was generally lower than that under high-WT conditions. Detection of the mRNA of the methanogen-specific mcrA gene indicated in situ methanogenesis in both water-saturated peat (below the WT) and unsaturated peat (above the WT). Analyses of DNA-derived and mRNA-derived methanogen community structures showed greater similarity between those two in water-saturated peat than in unsaturated peat. This suggested that favorable conditions promoted the activity of most members in methanogen communities, but unfavorable conditions showed differences between distinct community members in adaptation to adverse conditions.

AB The presence and distribution of isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), lipids that constitute the membranes of Archaea. have been investigated in a 50-cm long core from a Swedish peat bog. In the acrotelm, the periodically water saturated and thus oxic upper layer of the peat bog, only minor amounts of GDGTs were found. These amounts increase considerably in the catotelm, the continuously water saturated and consequently anoxic lower layer of the peat bog. Based on earlier analyses of GDGTs in different settings and on 16S rDNA results from literature, these lipids are likely derived from methanogenic Archaea. Crenarchaeol, previously only found in marine settings and in fresh water lakes, has also been found in this peat bog. Contrary to the other GDGTs, crenarchaeol concentrations remain relatively constant throughout the peat core, suggesting that they are produced by Crenarchaeota thriving in the oxic part of the peat bog and possibly also in the anoxic part.

DT Article
DE reduction; substrate; wetland delineation
ID REDOX; IRON; MANGANESE; MATTER
AB Wetland soils of the Maputaland Coastal Plain do not exhibit the redox morphology typically associated with extended periods of water saturation. The aim of this paper was to determine if the addition of various organic substrates (buffalo grass, peat, sucrose) would stimulate reduction of a selected soil from the Maputaland Coastal Plain. Results showed that the added buffalo grass and peat did not impact on reduction, irrespective of the amount added and were probably not readily oxidisable. Added sucrose was readily oxidisable and the amount applied significantly promoted reduction. Increased levels of the added organic substrates had a smaller effect on reduction. Higher total carbon levels (1.0% and 1.5%) typically resulted in lower pH and Eh, and higher Fe(2+)concentrations. Generally, pH and Eh both declined during the first 14 days of water saturation, with a concomitant increase in Fe2+, followed by an increase in pH and Eh and concomitant decrease in Fe(2+)over the next 28 days. It was concluded that the soils of the Maputaland Coastal Plain do not have enough residual organic carbon to support reduction and that a deficiency in readily oxidisable organic matter substrate should be further explored as cause for the absence of redoximorphic features in these soils.

AB In situ sampling techniques such as membrane dialysis are widely applied to the monitoring of heavy metal contamination in water-saturated environments. In this study, batch experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of humic substances (HS) on the diffusive transportation of metal ions across sampling membranes. The presence of HS substantially slowed the transportation of metal ions by 22.2, 20.3, 17.4, 16.6, and 14.9 % for Zn2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+, respectively, in the 100-mg/L HS-amended treatments relative to the treatments without HS under acidic conditions (pH=5.0). The retention effect of HS on the metal ions appeared to be relieved at a higher pH of 8.5. However, HS also slowed the transportation of metal ions (Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+ and Co2+) into the sampling cells when membranes soaked previously in porewater solution. The retention effects of HS can be attributed to the enhanced adsorption of metal ions on the surfaces of the membranes. Further study in saturated sediments verified that the membrane dialysis technique could underestimate the concentrations of metal ions by 13.3-40.2 % at the presences of HS. These findings suggest that collected porewater data using the membrane dialysis technique should be interpreted with caution with the consideration of in situ geochemical conditions such as HS or pH in water-saturated environments.

AB Arctic wetlands are significant sources of atmospheric methane and the observed accelerated climate changes in the arctic could cause a change in methane dynamics. Methane oxidation would be the key process to control methane emission from wetlands. In this study, we determined the potential methane oxidation rate of the wetland soils of a taiga-tundra transition zone in northeastern Siberia. Peat soil samples were collected in summer from depressions covered with tussocks of sedges andSphagnumspp. and from mounds vegetated with moss and larch trees. An aerobic bottle incubation experiment demonstrated that the soil samples collected from depressions in the moss- and sedge-dominated zones exhibited active methane oxidation with no time lag, while the mound soils showed no methane oxidation under the given conditions. The potential methane oxidation rates of the soils at 15 degrees C ranged from 94 to 496 nmol h(-1)g(-1)dw. The immediate and active methane oxidation was observed over the depths studied (0-40 cm) including the water-saturated anoxic layers; the maximum methane oxidation rate was recorded in the layer above the water-saturated layer. The methane oxidation rate was temperature-dependent, but substantial methane oxidation was observed even at 0 degrees C particularly for the moss soil samples. Soil samples collected from the frozen layer ofSphagnumpeat also showed immediate methane consumption when incubated at 15 degrees C. The present results suggest that the methane oxidizing bacteria in the wetland soils could survive under anoxic and frozen conditions keeping their potential activities and immediately utilize methane when the conditions become favorable. On the other hand, the inhibitor of methane oxidation (difluoromethane) did not affect the methane flux from the sedge and moss zonesin situ, which suggested the minor role of plant-associated methane oxidation.

AB Morphological investigations can be used to reveal the nature and distribution of solid matter and pore space within a porous medium, such as rock, soil or milled peat. When sampling milled peat, it is necessary to ensure that disturbance during sample collection and transportation is minimised, and a field impregnation is required to preserve the structure of the milled peat as it exists in the stockpile. Six impregnants were tested on peat of three density values (high, medium and low density) at air dry and near water saturated conditions. Suitability was determined by examining the resulting end product and attributing scores for selected factors. Endura epoxy proved to be most suitable impregnant (for this method, examining pores > 100 mu m), enabling the production of polished blocks within 4 days. The suitability of Endura epoxy was confirmed by a series of field trials. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Focussing the influence of redox processes on As redistribution, we conducted soil column experiments with the A (716 mg As kg(-1)), Ag (293 mg As kg(-1)) and 2Ag (37 mg As kg(-1)) horizons of a Mollic Gleysol (pH 7.2). The fixed beds were equipped with redox electrodes and suction cups and subjected to a saturation-drainage-saturation cycle. Water table fluctuations were simulated by defined pressure heads applied to the lower column boundaries via a digitally controlled vacuum system. After water saturation, the redox potential (E(H)) dropped to minimum values of around 0 mV in the A/Ag and-400 mV in the 2Ag horizon. Soil drainage resulted in a quick return to oxidising conditions. Both in the A and Ag horizons total aqueous As concentrations were low (up to 20 mu g l(-1)) and not related to E(H). In contrast, aqueous As concentrations of the 2Ag horizon were between 5 and 140 mu g l(-1) and increased as the E(H) decreased. However, the As species distribution showed no clear trend with E(H) since both As(III) and As(V) were detected under reducing conditions. High release of As in the 2Ag horizon is consistent with low contents in Fe (hydr)oxides. In the A and Ag horizons, pedogenetic enrichment of sesquioxides contributes to a comparably lower sensitivity of E(H) to water saturation and favours As retention. Thereby, As released under saturated conditions in the 2Ag horizon may be stabilised in the topsoil following capillary rise. Thus, surface horizons may act both as historic and as recent sinks for geogenic As at the site. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) profiling is applicable to study peatlands and swampy areas in permafrost but have some limitations in summer time. Theoretical calculations and field experiments show that estimating attenuation of electromagnetic waves is required for planning GPR survey. GPR data acquired with a 300 MHz antenna fail to resolve reflections from below the permafrost if the thaw/permafrost boundary is deeper than 1.5 m and the attenuation coefficient is 0.7, as in water-saturated peat. GPR data allow high-resolution lithological division of permafrost and provide reliable constraints on the depths to interfaces and physical properties of the ground. Thus, GPR can fully or partly substitute for the time- and labor-consuming direct measurements. The inferences have been confirmed by field results.

AB Naturally elevated levels of As have been observed in some iron-enriched lowland soils of the southern Munsterland, Germany. To determine whether As is mobilized by the reductive dissolution of As-hosting Fe oxides at reducing soil conditions, the release of arsenate and arsenite was investigated in the field for 24 mo and in laboratory experiments. The grassland Gleysol consists of oximorphic soil horizons (Ah 0-15, Bg 15-35, CrBg 35-70 cm) developed from fluvial loam overlaying sand with reductomorphic properties (2Cr, +70 cm). The soil has petrogleyic properties due to enrichment of oxidic Fe in the Bg and CrBg horizons (275 and 390 g kg(-1), respectively). Most of the petrogleyic Fe belonged to nanosized goethite, whereas ferrihydrite was dominant in the topsoil. Arsenic levels of 149 mg kg(-1) were found in the topsoil. Levels peaked in the oximorphic soil horizons (626 and 999 mg kg(-1), respectively) and were lowest in the sand (12 mg kg(-1)). Sequential fractionation revealed that 84 to 96% of the As in the oximorphic horizons was associated with Fe oxides. Water saturation in combination with soil temperatures above 5 to 10 degrees C resulted in a fast decrease of the redox potential (up to -120 mV) and release of As (up to 35 mu g L-1) with Fe into the soil solution only in the Ah horizon. Although the petrogleyic horizons were mostly water saturated with reducing conditions, no As release was observed. A lack of As mobilization was confirmed in experiments performed under fixed redox conditions; neither Fe nor As was released into solution at an appropriate redox potential. The As species distribution showed redox disequilibrium because arsenate was detected under reducing conditions and arsenite under oxidizing conditions. We conclude that microbial-mediated reductive dissolution of Fe oxides pushes the As mobilization in the topsoil; water saturation and soil temperature were key factors. The dominance of goethite, which is more resistant to microbial reduction, and/or the possible readsorption of released As onto remaining or newly formed Fe oxide surfaces is responsible for the absent As mobilization in the petrogleyic horizons.

AB Highly sensitive Raman gas spectroscopy is introduced for simultaneous real time analysis of O-2, CO2, CH4, and N-2 in order to elucidate the dynamics of greenhouse gases evolving from climate-sensitive ecosystems. The concentrations and fluxes of this suite of biogenic gases were quantified in the head space of a water-saturated, raised peat bog ecotron. The intact peat bog, exhibiting various degradation stages of peat and sphagnum moss, was exposed to various light regimes in order to determine important ecosystem parameters such as the maximum photosynthesis rate of the sphagnum as well as the extent of soil and plant respiration. Miniaturized Raman gas spectroscopy was proven to be an extremely versatile analytical technique that allows for onsite multigas analysis in high temporal resolution. Therefore it is an urgently needed tool for elucidation of complex biochemical processes especially in climate-sensitive ecosystems and consequently for the estimation of climate-relevant gas budgets.

AB The conditions and forming time of massive ice were specified (Bovanenkovo gas condensate field, Central Yamal). Here, massive ice lies as stratums, laccoliths, stocks, and lenses. Three thousand bore holes 10-100 m in depth were analyzed. In 260 of them massive ice was broached. The ice foot is situated from 1 to 57 m deep. The maximal thickness of ice broached with boreholes came to 28.5 m; on average, it was about 8 m. The extension of massive ice is sometimes more than 2000 m, and its area is quite often more than 10 km(2). According to the radiocarbon method, loams of the third terrace, containing and overlapping ice deposits, were formed from 25 000 to 20 000 years ago or somewhat later. These strongly peat loams containing massive ice formed either in shallow sea conditions or during periodical draining conditions of beaches or low laida, where organic matter appeared due to erosion and deposition and accumulated during draining and overgrowing of drains. In more inclement conditions than at present, loam deposits were frozen immediately, forming massive ice, which occupied the barely water-saturated layers. The oxygen isotope composition (delta O-18) of massive ice samples varied from -12.49 parts per thousand (here and further, relative to SMOW) to -22.95 parts per thousand. The deuterium concentration (delta D) varied from -91.7 to -177.1 parts per thousand. Deuterium kurtosis (d(exc)) varied from 3.4 to 10.6 parts per thousand. In one seam outcrop, the content of stable isotopes varied significantly. Here, at a depth of 0.2-0.8 m, the delta O-18 content varied by more than 10 parts per thousand (from -12.49 to -22.75), and the delta D content, from -91.7 to -171.9 parts per thousand. Such variations testify about ice extraction upon freezing of water-saturated grounds in a closed system. According to palynological analysis of ice stratums, numerous remains of unicellular green algae and diatoms were revealed. It is possible that this is evidence of the existence of a fresh well, which was a source of water, feeding the layer. Most probably these were near-bottom silt waters of a large lake or desalted bay, which were frozen syngenetically. This accentuates the new type of massive ice, syncriogenic segregative ice, which probably formed 25 000-20 000 yr BP.

AB Ground penetrating radar (GPR) was used to identify the thickness and geometry of peat in a groundwater fed wetland in Northern Wisconsin. The low electrical conductivity of the water-saturated peat permitted high resolution imaging to a depth of 16 m. The GPR survey results delineated a break in slope in the interface between peat and the underlying sand/gravel. Springs and ponds are located above the break in slope suggesting that thinning of the sand and gravel may focus groundwater flow upward to the wetland surface with emergence as springs. The results of the GPR surveys suggests a potential mechanism that controls the formation of large springs and pools above the break in slope. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Data of soil organic matter (SOM) content can be used for the assessment of stocks and changes of soil organic carbon (SOC) in peatland soils. Therefore, it is essentially necessary to convert SOM contents into SOC contents by SOM/SOC ratios ("conversion factors"). Various substrates of peatland soils in Northeastern Germany (n = 311) were analyzed in SOM/SOC ratios. Sphagnum peats showed significantly higher SOM/SOC ratios (2.05 +/- 0.09) than peats of vascular plants (1.73 +/- 0.09) and amorphous peats (1.93 +/- 0.29). Amorphous peats and humic sands (2.41 +/- 0.46) showed a high variability. The classification using WRB qualifiers featured significant differences (***P < 0.001) between humic, sapric, hemic andfibric substrates, except hemic and fibric peats of vascular plants. Moreover, impacts of drainage on pedogenesis could be proved in different SOM/SOC ratios of drained topsoils and water-saturated subsoils. Due to the high dependency of SOM/SOC ratios on the botanical origin, the implementation of peat type-related conversion factors is most suitable. In contrast, the application of one single conversion factor causes considerable conversion errors. As a consequence, many SOC assessment studies referring to peats should be reviewed.

AB At Birkenes, in southernmost Norway, cation exchange processes in peat bogs were investigated under saturated water flow conditions. Previous studies in this catchment have shown the importance of dynamic transport patterns of soil solution as the key to understanding streamwater chemistry. End-Member-Mixing Analysis (EMMA), developed on data from the Birkenes catchment and other sites, has so far been a useful concept in explaining the dynamics of stream chemistry. To obtain further information on the effect of water saturation on the degree of cation exchange during transport of soil solution, sodium chloride was injected into those parts of the peat soils along the main stream that are hydrologically saturated during rainstorms. The active buffer system of the soil matrix was effective in maintaining the level of the cations that were not added as a tracer. The tracer cation was fairly mobile under the experimental conditions, and only limited mobilization of other cations occurred. It is well known, from previous studies, that precipitation entering the catchment may reside there for days before leaving through discharge. The magnitude of cation exchange was less than might have been expected from the previous studies, which also considered hydrologically unsaturated conditions. The residence time during our experiments was probably insufficient for exchange that can be ascribed to classical equilibrium exchange. The extent of hydrodynamic dispersion is important for the magnitude of cation exchange.

AB The intercellular volume within tuber tissue increases with tuber maturation. At the same time, both tuber injury after mechanical load and lentical perforation after water uptake by tubers in wet peat decreases. The degree of tuber injury is correlated with intercellular space (r = -0.667, n = 16) and with water saturation of tissue (r = 0.697, n = 16). The tubers lose water during storage. In wet soil wilted tubers take up significantly higher amounts of water than turgid tubers, and lenticel perforation is much more frequent. Tuber maturation in autumn and low water loss during storage enhance the cushioning effect of the intercellular gas volume of tuber tissue against outside mechanical load and internal tension after water uptake.

AB The effects of site acidification on amphibian populations have been thoroughly addressed in the last decades. However, amphibians in naturally acidic environments, such as peatlands facing pressure from the peat mining industry, have received little attention. Through two field studies and an experiment, I assessed the use of bog habitats by the green frog (Rana clamitans melanota), a species sensitive to various forestry and peat mining disturbances. First, I compared the occurrence and breeding patterns of frogs in bog and upland ponds. I then evaluated frog movements between forest and bog habitats to determine whether they corresponded to breeding or postbreeding movements. Finally, I investigated, through a field experiment, the value of bogs as rehydrating areas for amphibians by offering living Sphagnum moss and two media associated with uplands (i.e., water with pH ca 6.5 and water-saturated soil) to acutely dehydrated frogs. Green frog reproduction at bog ponds was a rare event, and no net movements occurred between forest and bog habitats. However, acutely dehydrated frogs did not avoid Sphagnum. Results show that although green frogs rarely breed in bogs and do not move en masse between forest and bog habitats, they do not avoid bog substrates for rehydrating, despite their acidity. Thus, bogs offer viable summering habitat to amphibians, which highlights the value of these threatened environments in terrestrial amphibian ecology.

ID STRESS; ACCUMULATION
AB Wood fiber substrates perform well for lettuce seedlings production in speedling trays compared to standard commercially used press pots as well as growing media on peat base. Wood fibers contain a high air volume to allow higher levels of water tension without danger of water saturation in the substrate. For optimum growth they require a "high" matric potential. For cultivation of lettuce seedlings irrigation pulses at phi = -30 to -50 hPa are recommended in ebb and flood cultivation systems. This will provide good rooting and the least amount of proline, an indicator for plant stress.
   Accumulation of proline in lettuce seedlings could only be proved under conditions of visible stress symptoms. Not only water tension, but also the substrates in raising systems influence the free content of proline. At phi = -200 hPa proline in lettuce seedlings cultivated in a peat based press pots were ca. 40 % lower compare to seedlings in a wood fiber substrate in speedling trays. The difference in proline content between well-watered and stressed seedlings was smaller than with tomato transplants. Also, the correlation between proline content of lettuce seedlings and critical water tension for irrigation pulses was lower than with tomato transplant.
   The lettuce plants performed well after transplanting and no differences derived from seedling-treatments were recorded.

AB The objective of this study was to examine plant community development and peat stratigraphy in the context of ground-water flow systems for five forested peatlands in central New York State for which extensive vegetation, surface hydrology, and water chemistry analyses has been performed. Peatland development trends, from the initial period of peat accumulation to the present, were explored using pear stratigraphy, analysis of ground-water flow systems and evidence fi om existing vegetation. Detailed analyses, including the construction of numerical ground-water models were performed for one of the five sites to examine the process of bog development within what was once a highly calcareous fen and to examine the impacts of agricultural drainage on peatland ground-water flow. Feat stratigraphy analysis indicated two pathways of peatland development: infilling of shallow lakes and peat accumulation on ground-water seeps. Lake-infill peatlands were characterized by a sequence of Limnic peat--> bryophyte-sedge peat-->hemic-fibric sedge peat-->sapric wood peat (or Sphagnum peat). Analysis of ground-water flow systems indicated that four of the peatlands were characterized by mineral-rich ground-water discharge along peatland margins, with lateral flow through the peatlands towards drainage features. The fifth peatland was characterized by a more complex ground-water flow system with a weakly minerotrophic water-table mound driving shallow ground-water recharge flow. The water-table mound has been reduced in extent by agricultural drainage and demonstrates seasonal fluctuations in hydraulic head and areal extent.

AB Drying and rewetting to a variable extent influence the C gas exchange between peat soils and the atmosphere. We incubated a decomposed and compacted fen peat and investigated in two experiments 1) the vertical distribution of CO2 and CH4 production rates and their response to drying and 2) the effects of temperature, drying intensity and duration on CO2 production rates and on CH4 production recovery after rewetting. Surface peat down to 5 cm contributed up to 67% (CO2) and above 80% (CH4) of the depth-aggregated (50 cm) production. As CO2 production sharply decreased with depth water table fluctuations in deeper peat layers are thus not expected to cause a substantial increase in soil respiration in this site. Compared to anaerobic water saturated conditions drying increased peat CO2 production by a factor between 1.4 and 2.1. Regarding the effects of the studied factors, warmer conditions increased and prolonged drying duration decreased CO2 production whereas the soil moisture level had little influence. No significant interactions among factors were found. Short dry events under warmer conditions are likely to result in greatest peaks of CO2 production rates. Upon rewetting, CH4 production was monitored over time and the recovery was standardized to pre-drying levels to compare the treatment effects. Methane production increased non-linearly over time and all factors (temperature, drying intensity and duration) influenced the pattern of post-drying CH4 production. Peat undergoing more intense and longer drying events required a longer lag time before substantial CH4 production occurred and warmer conditions appeared to speed up the process.

AB Ground-water flow simulations are used to evaluate the importance of three parameters on vertical flow in peatlands: regional slope. permeability of the mineral soil underlying the peat, and peatland topography. Our results indicate that the extent of vertical ground-water flow in peatlands is primarily controlled by mineral soil permeability. Local ground-water flow cells that form under small water-table mounds at bog domes can drive peat pore water into permeable mineral soil. However, when peat forms over low permeability mineral soil, vertical movement of peat pore water becomes negligible and lateral flow of water in the upper portion of the peat column dominates the peatland hydrology. This effect is not due to the low permeability of humified peat layers, as is commonly assumed in many peatland studies. Field data from the Hudson Bay Lowland (Canada) and the Glacial Lake Agassiz peatlands of northern Minnesota confirm the validity of these models. These results are relevant in settings other than peatlands where relief is low and small topographic mounds exist. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mobilization and deposition of iron nano and sub-micrometer particles (INSMP) in a porous medium were investigated using a water-saturated glass micromodel. The deposition and detachment of INSMP in the micromodel were visualized by taking serial images and experimentally verified by analysis of breakthrough curves. This first visualization study of INSMP fate showed that there were dense aggregations at the pores as the concentration of INSMP increased. The presence of dissolved humic substances (>1 ppm) significantly reduced deposition of suspended particles and enhanced detachment of the deposited particles. The mobility of INSMP in the presence of Pahokee peat fulvic acid standard II (PPFA) was higher than for Pahokee peat humic acid standard I (PPHA) due to the presence of more aromatic groups and the molecular weight in PPFA. Interfacial energy estimation based on the DLVO theory revealed that the adsorption of humic substances onto the INSMP increased the energy barrier and reduced the depth of secondary minimum between particles. The "affinity transition" in the initial deposition of INSMP within the micromodel was observed in the presence of Pahokee peat humic substances. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A peat deposit from the East European Russian Arctic, spanning nearly 10 000 years, was investigated to study soil organic matter degradation using analyses of bulk elemental and stable isotopic compositions and plant macrofossil remains. The peat accumulated initially in a wet fen that was transformed into a peat plateau bog following aggradation of permafrost in the late Holocene (similar to 2500 cal a BP). Total organic carbon and total nitrogen (N) concentrations are higher in the fen peat than in the moss-dominated bog peat layers. Layers in the sequence that have lower concentrations of total hydrogen (H) are associated with degraded vascular plant residues. C/N and H/C atomic ratios indicate better preservation of organic matter in peat material dominated by bryophytes as opposed to vascular plants. The presence of permafrost in the peat plateau stage and water-saturated conditions at the bottom of the fen stage appear to lead to better preservation of organic plant material. delta 15N values suggest N isotopic fractionation was driven primarily by microbial decomposition whereas differences in delta 13C values appear to reflect mainly changes in plant assemblages. Positive shifts in both delta 15N and delta 13C values coincide with a local change to drier conditions as a result of the onset of permafrost and frost heave of the peat surface. This pattern suggests that permafrost aggradation not only resulted in changes in vegetation but also aerated the underlying fen peat, which enhanced microbial denitrification, causing the observed 15N-enrichment.

AB Salt pools are water-filled depressions common to north-temperate salt marshes. In Wells, ME, USA, cores reveal a unique salt pool signature consisting of water-saturated dark-gray mud often containing fragments of Ruppia maritima. Cores through pool sediment reenter salt marsh peat, not tidal flat sediment, demonstrating that most pools are of secondary origin. A principal component analysis of attribute data collected from 119 pools defines three distinct pool types: those with (1) surrounding high-marsh vegetation and thick heavily undercut banks (40% of the variance), (2) surrounding low-marsh vegetation and thicker slightly undercut banks (18% of the variance), and (3) surrounding low-marsh vegetation and less thick moderately undercut banks, containing R. maritima and a surficial drainage (15% of the variance). Cores and spatiotemporal analyses of aerial photographs between 1962 and 2003 reveal dramatic salt marsh surface dynamism suggesting that salt pools influence the geomorphological evolution of coastal marshes.

The simulated fluxes matched well to measurements in all microsites without any parameter adjustment. The model emphasizes the importance of microsite characteristics, water table and vegetation cover for methane fluxes. Water level determines the moisture and oxygen profile in peat matrix and therefore affects methane production and oxidation rates in peat profile. Vascular plants provide methanogenesis with substrates, form a pathway for methane to liberate from peat to the atmosphere and enhance methane oxidation by transporting oxygen to water saturated peat. The model connects methane fluxes to the seasonal photosynthetic cycle of plants at the microsite level and hence dynamically combines the microbial processes in peat to changing environmental factors in the level of peatland ecosystem. Sensitivity analysis of the model reveals the importance of substrate supply to methane fluxes. In addition, the capability of the vascular plants to transport oxygen downwards has a large effect on model outcome. Lack of oxygen and methane keep methane oxidation at a low level in the model simulations, and changes that compensate for these lacks have a remarkable decreasing effect on simulated flux. Dry periods decrease the simulated methane flux considerably, especially if the drought prevails long, threshold for a dramatic decrease lying between 4 and 6 weeks of drought. Increase in air temperature enhances methane flux, especially if the effect of increased temperature on gross primary production is taken into account.

AB Three-dimensional ground-water modeling experiments were done to test the hypothesis that regional ground-water flow is an important component of the water budget in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands of northern Minnesota. Previous data collected from the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands suggest that regional ground-water flow discharges to these peatlands, maintaining saturation, controlling the peat pore-water chemistry, and driving ecological change. To test this hypothesis, steady-state MODFLOW models were constructed that encompassed an area of 10,160 km(2). Data used in this modeling project included surface-water and water-table elevations measured across the study area, digital elevation data, and well logs from scientific test wells and domestic water wells drilled in the study area. Numerical simulations indicate that the Itasca Moraine, located to the south of the peatland, acts as a recharge area for regional ground-water flow. Ground water recharged at the Itasca Moraine did not discharge to the Red Lake Peatlands, but rather was intercepted by the Red Lakes or adjacent rivers. Simulations suggest that ground-water flow within the peatlands consists of local-flow systems with streamlines that are less than 10 km long and that ground water from distant recharge areas does not play a prominent role in the hydrology of these peatlands. Ground-water flow reversals previously observed in the Red Lake Peatlands are either the result of interactions between local and intermediate-scale flow systems or the transient release of water stored in glacial sediments when the watertable is lowered.

AB Methane, which is produced by methanogenic archaea, is the second most abundant carbon compound in the atmosphere. Due to its strong radiative forcing, many studies have been conducted to determine its sources, budget, and dynamics. However, a mechanistic model of methane flux has not been developed thus far. In this study, we attempt to examine the relevance of the abundance of methanogen as a biological indicator of methane flux in three different types of soil ecosystems: permafrost, rice paddy, and mountainous wetland. We measured the annual average methane flux and abundance of methanogen in the soil ecosystems in situ. The correlation between methane flux and the abundance of methanogen exists only under a specific biogeochemical conditions such as SOM of higher than 60 %, pH of 5.6-6.4, and water-saturated. Except for these conditions, significant correlations were absent. Therefore, microbial abundance information can be applied to a methane flux model selectively depending on the biogeochemical properties of the soil ecosystem.

AB The present study reports on the development of ombrotrophic raised bogs in NE Germany after the adoption of a protective program with a focus on the hydrological and floristic changes in two simultaneously restored cut-over bogs as a reference for all other bogs. At the moment, four fifths of the bogs area is dominated by woody vegetation forms and < 5 % is characterized by typical raised bog vegetation. The trend of increasing areas with woody vegetation forms and decreasing areas with vegetation typical for ombrotrophic raised bogs could not be prevented despite increasing the portion of revitalized areas. The reason for the negative developments is founded in the different types of raised bogs in NE Germany, which differ in regard to the historical lagg area and the original grown up raised peat body. This as well as the kind and intensity of anthropogenic use have significant implications for the possibilities of revitalization and protection. Except for those bogs where no peat remnants remain, the revitalization of cut-over raised bogs in NE Germany can succeed if an almost closed hydrological protection zone (HPZ which is equal to the historical lagg area) is established so that the gradient of entire lateral water flow between the higher lying peat remnant and the lower lying surrounding area is reduced. The attainment of a lateral water flow gradient comparable to the original state and of a water-saturated peat body succeeds in turn in the precondition for growing Sphagnum species, which readjust the system's self regulation. The comparison of two bogs with similar preconditions concerning location, climate, and anthropogenic transformation has shown that an incompletely closed HPZ is one important reason for the decreasing portion of intact raised bogs with their typical vegetation. The influence of climate change on current hydrological and floristic changes in NE German ombrotrophic raised bogs has less influence on the success of revitalization than the historic grown type of bog and the intensity of anthropogenic use.

AB The paralic, Lower-Middle Jurassic Baga Formation of the Island of Bornholm, Denmark, was deposited in a fault-bounded, subsiding, pull-apart basin. The formation is up to 400 m thick and contains more than 50 coal seams. Twelve of these have been investigated petrographically and geochemically to provide basic information on the composition of the relatively unknown Jurassic coals. The peat-forming environments represented by the seams and the associated siliciclastic sediments are interpreted.
   The seams represent three types of environments with organic matter deposition. Feat accumulation occurred in low-lying areas situated between river channels in a coastal plain environment undergoing overall transgression. The coals have a relatively uniform, huminite-rich petrographic composition, indicating that the precursor mires were dominated by persistent, water-saturated and anoxic conditions. The swamps were probably occupied by a small-statured flora with cellulose-rich tissues. Significant bacterial activity in the peat swamps is suggested by an abundance of hopanes. Influence from marine water was not common but occurred occasionally. During peat accumulation, the depositional conditions were stable and quiet. The small thicknesses of the seams (8-57 cm thick) indicate relatively short periods of peat formation (average c. 2300 yr), due to continued base-level rise, controlled by subsidence, and an overall eustatic rise, causing repeated changes in the sedimentary regimes. The coal seams are of low rank and were buried to a depth of 1100-1200 m before uplift, due to Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary basin inversion and Neogene uplift.

AB Organic matter decomposition in response to thawing permafrost has critical implications for carbon release. This study examined how thaw induced plant community and environmental changes influenced litter and peat decomposition in a subarctic peatland.
   We conducted laboratory incubations under current site pre-thaw (dry and large oxic peat layer) and thawed (wet and small oxic peat layer) conditions, and mimiced pond thaw conditions (water saturated and anoxic) at 4 and 22 A degrees C. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) releases from ground surface plant litter and top 1 m peat samples at permafrost area (Palsa) and wet thawed lawn (WL) were quantified under current site conditions. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released from litter was additionally quantified under pond thaw conditions.
   Plant litter mass significantly increased from Palsa to WL. Under current site conditions, litter in WL had significantly higher CO2 and CH4 production rates than litter in Palsa. Pond thaw conditions changed litter carbon loss partitioning into lower CO2 but higher DOC and CH4 production, and increased total carbon release. Whole peat decomposition was restricted from Palsa to WL with thaw. Estimated growing season gas carbon loss (CO2 and CH4) in WL was greater than that in Palsa due to significantly increased litter carbon loss after thaw.
   Changes in organic matter decomposition, especially litter decomposition, enlarged carbon losses from this subarctic peatland with permafrost thaw.

ID LANDFILL; WATER
AB An artificial fen environment was constructed near the municipality of Beavercreek, Ohio, The constructed wetland environment utilizes local ground-water flow patterns to maintain a high degree of water saturation. Chemical reactions driven by the activity of plant roots and soil microorganisms affect the spatial distribution and magnitude of hydrogeochemical parameters, including alkalinity, pH, redox potential, and concentrations of Ca+2, Mg+2, total iron, NO3-, and SO4-2. The purpose of this study is to investigate the chemical interactions between wetland plants and ground water by means of characterizing the spatial variation in hydrogeochemical parameters, Nested piezometers within the artificial fen are used to monitor ground-water chemistry within, and immediately adjacent to, the rhizosphere of cultivated plant species, The major reactions at the site include oxidation of organic matter by Fe(OH)(3) and dissolution of carbonate minerals driven by high CO2 production in the root zone, The relationship between alkalinity and dissolved concentrations of Ca+2 and Mg+2 suggests that organic anions could also be major alkalinity contributors, Redox potential is buffered by the reduction of Fe(OH)(3) and is typically maintained in the range of 100-200 mV. This buffering effect prevents the formation of sulfide and methane commonly found in similar wetland environments, This finding suggests that methane production associated with rice cultivation can be prevented by the addition of Fe(OH)(3) to rice fields.

AB Peatlands store vast amounts of organic carbon, amounting to approximately 455 Pg. Carbon builds up in these water-saturated environments owing to the presence of phenolic compounds-which inhibit microbial activity and therefore prevent the breakdown of organic matter. Anoxic conditions limit the activity of phenol oxidase, the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of phenolic compounds. Droughts introduce oxygen into these systems, and the frequency of these events is rising. Here, we combine in vitro manipulations, mesocosm experiments and field observations to examine the impact of drought on peatland carbon loss. We show that drought stimulates bacterial growth and phenol oxidase activity, resulting in a reduction in the concentration of phenolic compounds in peat. This further stimulates microbial growth, causing the breakdown of organic matter and the release of carbon dioxide in a biogeochemical cascade. We further show that re-wetting the peat accelerates carbon losses to the atmosphere and receiving waters, owing to drought-induced increases in nutrient and labile carbon levels, which raise pH and stimulate anaerobic decomposition. We suggest that severe drought, and subsequent re-wetting, could destabilize peatland carbon stocks; understanding this process could aid understanding of interactions between peatlands and other environmental trends, and lead to the development of strategies for increasing carbon stocks.

AB Boreal peatlands represent a large global carbon pool. The relationships between carbon mineralization, soil temperature and moisture in the permafrost peatlands of the Great Hing'an Mountains, China, were examined. The CO2 emissions were measured during laboratory incubations of samples from four sites under different temperatures (5, 10, 15, and 20 degrees C) and moisture contents (0%, 30%, 60%, 100% water holding capacity (WHC) and completely water saturated). Total carbon mineralization ranged from 15.51 to 112.92 mg C under the treatments for all sites. Carbon mineralization rates decreased with soil depth, increased with temperature, and reached the highest at 60% WHC at the same temperature. The calculated temperature coefficient (Q(10)) values ranged from 1.84 to 2.51 with the soil depths and moisture. However, the values were not significantly affected by soil moisture and depth for all sites due to the different peat properties (P > 0.05). We found that the carbon mineralization could be successfully predicted as a two-compartment function with temperature and moisture (R-2 > 0.96) and total carbon mineralization was significantly affected by temperature and moisture (P < 0.05). Thus, temperature and moisture would play important roles in carbon mineralization of permafrost peatlands in the Great Hing'an Mountains, indicating that the permafrost peatlands would be sensitive to the environment change, and the permafrost peatlands would be potentially mineralized under future climate change.

AB In spite of advances in greenhouse gas research, the spatiotemporal CH4 and N2O dynamics of boreal land-scapes remain challenging, e.g., we need clarification of whether forest-mire transitions are occasional hotspots of landscape CH4 and N2O emissions during exceptionally high and low ground water level events.
   In our study, we tested the differences and drivers of CH4 and N2O dynamics of forest/mire types in field conditions along the soil moisture gradient of the forest-mire ecotone. Soils changed from Podzols to Histosols and ground water rose downslope from a depth of 10m in upland sites to 0.1m in mires. Yearly meteorological conditions changed from being exceptionally wet to typical and exceptionally dry for the local climate. The median fluxes measured with a static chamber technique varied from -51 to 586 mu gm(-2) h(-1) for CH4 and from 0 to 6 mu m(-2) h(-1) for N2O between forest and mire types throughout the entire wet-dry period.
   In spite of the highly dynamic soil water fluctuations in carbon rich soils in forest-mire transitions, there were no large peak emissions in CH4 and N2O fluxes and the flux rates changed minimally between years. Methane uptake was significantly lower in poorly drained transitions than in the well-drained uplands. Water-saturated mires showed large CH4 emissions, which were reduced entirely during the exceptional summer drought period. Near-zero N2O fluxes did not differ significantly between the forest and mire types probably due to their low nitrification potential. When up-scaling boreal landscapes, pristine forest-mire transitions should be regarded as CH4 sinks and minor N2O sources instead of CH4 and N2O emission hotspots.

AB Peatlands are large repositories of atmospheric carbon and concern has been raised over the stability of this carbon store because increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations have been observed in peatland drainage waters. A number of potential causes have been proposed in the literature, and conflicting results among studies conducted at different spatial and temporal scales suggest that the methodological approach may be an important confounding factor. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of moisture and temperature on DOC release from a south-central Ontario peatland during the fall (a major export period) following three commonly used approaches: laboratory microcosms. an intensive field study and analysis of long-term data (1980-2008). The effect of variations in temperature and moisture differed among microcosm, field study and analysis of the long-term record. Water content was important at the microcosm scale as DOC concentration and aromaticity increased with peat water-saturation. Drought caused a decrease in DOC concentration and pH, and an increase in sulphate and base cation concentrations. In contrast, the field study indicated that DOC concentration was strongly associated with temperature, and weakly correlated (negatively) with stream discharge. Average fall DOC concentration (but not export) increased over the 29 year record, and was correlated with fall discharge and precipitation (negative) and summer precipitation and fall stream pH (positive). As no common strong predictor of fall DOC was found at three scales of investigation at a single, well-studied site, it may be unreasonable to expect to identify a universal driver behind the widespread increase in DOC concentration.

AB 1. Functional traits mechanistically capture plant responses to environmental gradients as well as plant effects on ecosystem functioning. Yet most trait-based theory stems from terrestrial systems and extension to other habitats can provide new insights.
   2. Wetlands differ from terrestrial systems in conditions (e.g. soil water saturation, anoxia, pH extremes), plant adaptations (e.g. aerenchyma, clonality, ubiquity of bryophytes) and important processes (e.g. denitrification, peat accumulation, methane emission). Wetland plant adaptations and trait (co-)variation can be situated along major plant trait trade-off axes (e.g. the resource economics spectrum), but soil saturation represents a complex stress gradient beyond a simple extension of commonly studied water availability gradients.
   3. Traits that affect ecosystem functioning overlap with patterns in terrestrial systems. But wetland-specific traits that mediate plant effects on soil redox conditions, microbial communities and on water flow, as well as trait spectra of mosses, vary among wetland types.
   4. Synthesis. With increasing availability of quantitative plant traits a trait-based ecology of wetlands is emerging, with the potential to advance process-based understanding and prediction. We provide an interactive cause-and-effect framework that may guide research efforts to disentangle the multiple interacting processes involved in scaling from environmental conditions to ecosystem functioning via plant communities.

DT Article
DE Wetlands; Vegetation; Energy fluxes; Primary production; Landscape

ID WATER; EVAPORATION; RATIO
AB Since wetlands are ecosystems that have an ample supply of water, they play an important role in the energy budgets of their respective landscapes due to their capacity to shift energy fluxes in favor of latent heat. Rates of evapotranspiration in wetlands are commonly as high as 6-15 mm day(-1), testifying to the large amount of energy that is dissipated through this process. Emergent or semi-emergent wetland macrophytes substantially influence the solar energy distribution due to their high capacity for transpiration. Wetland ecosystems in eutrophic habitats show a high primary production of biomass because of the highly efficient use of solar energy in photosynthesis. In wetlands associated with the slow decomposition of dead organic matter, such as oligotrophic marshes or fens and bogs, the accumulation of biomass is also high, in spite of the rather low primary production of biomass. Most of the energy exchange in water-saturated wetlands is, however, linked with heat balance, whereby the largest proportion of the incoming energy is dissipated during the process of evapotranspiration. An example is shown of energy fluxes during the course of a day in the wetland ecosystem of Mokr, Louky (Wet Meadows) near TA (TM) eboA. The negative consequences of the loss of wetlands for the local and regional climate are discussed.

AB The object of this study is to document how the Inuit on the northern coast of Labrador, Canada used terrestrial resources such as peat and wood during the Little Ice Age (LIA; A.D. 15001870). Paleoecological investigations consisting of pollen and macrofossil analyses were undertaken in conjunction with archaeological excavations at the Inuit winter settlement sites of Oakes Bay 1, located in the Nain region of north-central Labrador. Our data indicate that the major changes in terrestrial ecosystems of this coastal region were triggered by climate change. From ca. 5700 to 3000 cal. yr B.P., climatic conditions were relatively warm and moist. At ca. 3000 cal. yr B.P. conditions became significantly drier and colder, which corresponds to broader climatic trends during the Neoglacial period. At ca. 1000 cal. yr B.P., the reappearance of hygrophilic species and the establishment of Larix laricina provide evidence of a return to more humid conditions that in turn triggered the onset of the paludification of sandy terraces in the Dog Island region. Peat accumulation persisted after ca. 580 cal. yr B.P. likely due to the elevation of the frost table during the LIA. Elevated frost tables contributed to water saturation of the surface during the spring, creating conditions that were conducive to the preservation of organic material. Natural resources such as trees and peat were therefore readily available and more abundant during the LIA and extensively used by the Inuit for house construction and heating in the Dog Island region.

AB There is increasing concern over the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in biosolids, while sales in commercially available biosolid-based products used as soil amendments are also increasing. Here, the occurrence of 17 perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) present in 13 commercially available biosolid-based products, six organic composts (manure, mushroom, peat, and untreated wood), and one food and yard waste compost were studied. The PFAA concentration ranges observed are as follows: biosolid-based products (9.0-199 mu g/kg) > food and yard waste (18.5 mu g/kg) > other organic products (0.1-1.1 mu g/kg). Analysis of 2014, 2016, and 2018 bags produced from one product line showed a temporal decrease in the total PFAAs (181, 101, and 74 mu g/kg, respectively). The total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay revealed the presence of PFAA precursors in the biosolid-based products at much higher levels, when the soluble carbon was removed by the ENVI-Carb clean-up prior to the TOP assay. Time-of-flight mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of three sulfonamides, two fluorotelomer sulfonates, and several polyfluoroalkyl phosphate diesters. Pore-water concentrations of water-saturated products were primarily of short-chain PFAAs and increased with increasing PFAA concentrations in the products. A strong positive log-linear correlation between organic carbon (OC)-normalized PFAA partition coefficients and the number of CFn units indicates that OC is a good predictor of PFAA release concentrations.

AB Peatlands are an important global carbon reservoir. The continued accumulation of carbon in peatlands depends on the persistence of anoxic conditions, in part induced by water saturation, which prevents oxidation of organic matter, and slows down decomposition. Here we investigate how and over what time scales the hydrological regime impacts the geochemistry and the bacterial community structure of temperate peat soils. Peat cores from two sites having contrasting groundwater budgets were subjected to four controlled drought-rewetting cycles. Pore water geochemistry and metagenomic profiling of bacterial communities showed that frequent water table drawdown induced lower concentrations of dissolved carbon, higher concentrations of sulfate and iron and reduced bacterial richness and diversity in the peat soil and water. Short-term drought cycles (3-9 day frequency) resulted in different communities from continuously saturated environments. Furthermore, the site that has more frequently experienced water table drawdown during the last two decades presented the most striking shifts in bacterial community structure, altering biogeochemical functioning of peat soils. Our results suggest that the increase in frequency and duration of drought conditions under changing climatic conditions or water resource use can induce profound changes in bacterial communities, with potentially severe consequences for carbon storage in temperate peatlands.

AB In principle, conventional lysimeters are suitable for the investigation of vertical water and solute fluxes. Lateral fluxes in water-saturated fen sites are characterized by heterogeneities and abnormities due to anisotropic layering. But due to lack of adequate monitoring techniques, these fluxes have been insufficiently analyzed. The newly developed large weighable fen lysimeter (LWFL) overcomes the limitations of conventional lysimetry and enables the measurement of vertical and horizontal transport processes in undisturbed large volume soil monoliths. The LWFL has a volume of 6 m(3) (4 m length, 1 m width and 1.5 m depth) and was tested by filling the lysimeter with an undisturbed fen monolith. A special extraction procedure for the horizontal sliding of the lysimeter vessel through the natural fen was developed. In front of the vessel a converted cutting tool assisted in carving the soil monolith out of the peat, both vertically and horizontally. Inlet and outlet of the LWFL was constructed to allow the adjustment of a wide range of hydraulic gradients to depict natural occurring lateral transport processes. The LWFL including the measurement techniques was tested successfully for 3 years. On the basis of these tests, we conclude that complex physical and biogeochemical research problems involving lateral flows can be tackled now with multiphase observations and measurements at high spatial and temporal resolution, transdisciplinary data evaluation and numerical modelling approaches.

AB Drained peatlands, especially nitrogen (N) -rich ones, are sources of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere. As this emission is largely caused by N mineralization in oxic peat soil, rewetting the peat soil is likely to decrease the N2O emissions to similar levels with natural, undrained peatlands. Emissions from these water-saturated peat soils have often been assumed negligible, for example in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories. However, the number of published data of annual N2O emissions from undrained peatlands is small and even smaller for rewetted peatlands. Thus, we still have limited understanding of the effects of land-use change such as drainage and rewetting. We analyzed N2O flux data, mostly previously unpublished, from 28 undrained, 65 forestry-drained, and 24 rewetted boreal peatland study sites in Finland and calculated annual N2O emissions for each site, including emissions from ditches at 51 sites. We classified the sites into nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor ones, similar to the IPCC guidelines. Annual N2O emissions from the undrained peatlands were consistently small, but not negligible, averaging 0.11 and 0.10 g m-2a 1 in the nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor sites, respectively. Emissions from the drained peatlands were significantly higher than from the undrained peatlands in the nutrient-rich (mean 0.23 g m(-2) a(-1)) but not in the nutrient-poor (mean 0.08 g m(-2) a(-1)) sites. Emissions from the rewetted peatlands (means 0.05 and 0.08 g m(-2) a(-1) for nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor sites, respectively) were similar or lower than from the undrained ones. Emissions from ditches were similar to those from strips and correlated positively with strip emissions at the drained sites. Nutrient-rich soil (low CN ratio) and a low water table increased emissions significantly at the drained sites, whereas the continuously higher water tables kept emissions low at all undrained and rewetted sites. In conclusion, rewetting is an effective means to decrease the N2O emissions of nutrient-rich drained peatlands back to natural levels, although this natural level is not zero, as has been suggested earlier.

ID CARBONATE PRECIPITATION
AB Peat soil is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation, formed under the condition of nearly permanent water saturation, which makes the high moisture and compressibility as two main features of peat. In recent years, the lack of construction lands diverts researchers' attention to make use of marginal grounds, like peatland, after some improvements. The past decade has witnessed a growing interest in microbial induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) due to its reliability, broad application, and potential contribution to sustainable and green development. This study has two primary aims: (i) investigating the feasibility and effectiveness of MICP in peat soil combined with bamboo fiber reinforcement, and (ii) ascertaining the mechanism of bamboo fiber incorporated MICP. Bamboo fiber possesses some unparalleled advantages owing to its fast growth and ability to survive in diverse climates. This study differs from previous researches in the use of native bacteria isolated from the peat soil, while most of them were conducted using exogenous bacteria, which might pose a threat regarding adaption and microbial pollution. Different concentrations of cementation resources (1-3 mol/L) and proportion of fibers (0-50%) were studied, and each case was well designed. Treated samples were subjected to the fall cone test to estimate the undrained shear strength at certain time intervals. The results revealed that samples with higher fiber content gained higher strength than others did, whereas high initial cementation resources in soil could reduce strength. Microscale observations were also performed on treated samples to clarify the mechanism of MICP incorporated with fiber.

AB Perennial frost mounds identified as lithalsas occur in the Sentsa River valley of the Eastern Sayan Mountains, Russia. We report the first detailed study of permafrost in this region, based on analysis of the cryostructure and distribution of stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen, and ion concentrations from the ice-rich cores of two lithalsas 3-7 m high. Their main cryostructures are reticulate and lenticular, with visible ice contents exceeding 50-60%. The vertical and lateral distribution of (18)? and D values show a step-by-step mechanism of lithalsa growth: in the first stage a large lithalsa formed, and in the second stage a small lithalsa formed. The more negative isotope values of ice in the large lithalsa ice probably resulted from gradual release of isotopically depleted water from the central to peripheral part of the massif during ice segregation in water-saturated fine-grained lake sediments. Minor variations of isotope values suggest intensive recharge of lake-fen and meteoric water supply during freezing and lithalsa growth. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Oceanic mangroves accumulate peat with sea-level rise without terrestrial sediment inputs, but fossil peat's elevation as a tide-range limited sea-level indicator is assumed to be affected by compaction. Despite assumption of decomposition, compression, and dewatering, pure Rhizophora mangle peat appears coarse, water-saturated, and loose even at depth. Calibrated peat densities from computed tomography (CT) and petrologic analysis allow quantitative assessment of compaction in continuous peats from Florida (6 m thick), Belize (12 m thick), and Panama (3.5 m thick). Pure peat exhibits voids at all depths and >80% water contents. CT density does not increase with depth; bulk densities are low, minimally variable, and trend-free. Higher CT-density intervals coincide with compositional changes (sediment, coral). CT of peat buried under sediment shows a shift to higher densities. CT of air-dried continuous peat shows uncompressed fine and coarse roots and voids, with negative densities indicative of air in place of interstitial water. Peat's high water content and hydraulic conductivity prevent dewatering and compaction, hypothetically maintaining original sea-level indicative elevations at intermediate depths. Non-compacted, sediment-free, offshore peats can provide a continuous proxy for reconstructing the record of sea-level rise at any site, if depositional, disturbance, and geochemical and biotic processes affecting C-14 ages are also assessed.

AB Magnetized quark nuggets (MQNs) are a recently proposed dark-matter candidate consistent with the Standard Model and with Tatsumi's theory of quark-nugget cores in magnetars. Previous publications have covered their formation in the early universe, aggregation into a broad mass distribution before they can decay by the weak force, interaction with normal matter through their magnetopause, and a first observation consistent MQNs: a nearly tangential impact limiting their surface-magnetic-field parameter B-o from Tatsumi's similar to 10(12+/-1) T to 1.65 x 10(12) T +/- 21%. The MQN mass distribution and interaction cross section strongly depend on B-o. Their magnetopause is much larger than their geometric dimensions and can cause sufficient energy deposition to form non-meteorite craters, which are reported approximately annually. We report computer simulations of the MQN energy deposition in water-saturated peat, soft sediments, and granite, and report the results from excavating such a crater. Five points of agreement between observations and hydrodynamic simulations of an MQN impact support this second observation being consistent with MQN dark matter and suggest a method for qualifying additional MQN events. The results also redundantly constrain B-o to >= 4 x 10(11) T.

AB Extensive pipeline and railway corridors crossing Canadian peatlands make them vulnerable to hydrocarbon spills, potentially impairing ecosystem health, so it is important to be able to forecast hydrocarbon fate and transport within and beyond the peatland. The redistribution of hydrocarbon liquids in groundwater systems are controlled by the multiphase flow characteristics of the aquifer material including capillary pressure-saturation relative permeability (P-c-S-k(r)) relations. However, these relations have never been characterized for the hydrocarbon-water phases in peat. To address this, the flow and transport of diesel and water in peat soils were examined through a number of one dimensional vertical immiscible displacement tests, in which diesel was percolated into peat pore space displacing peat water, leading to a two-phase flow regime. Inverse modelling simulations using both Brooks and Corey's and power law relative permeability models, matched the data of the immiscible displacement tests well. Irreducible water saturation (S-wirr) and the curvature of water relative permeability relation increased with peat bulk density. The residual diesel saturation (S-Nr) ranged between 0.3% and 17% and increased with bulk density of peat. In a given peat, S-Nr was a function of saturation history and increased with increasing maximum diesel saturation. The receding contact angles of water in water-air systems and diesel in diesel-air systems, respectively, were 51.7 degrees and 61.2 degrees, showing that the wetting tendency of peat in the air imbibition condition is toward the draining liquid. These experiments advance our knowledge on the behavior of hydrocarbons in peat, and can improve numerical modelling of hydrocarbon transport after a spill.

AB The accumulation of biogenic greenhouse gases (methane, carbon dioxide) in organic sediments is an important factor in the redevelopment and risk management of many brownfield sites. Good practice with brownfield site characterization requires the identification of free-gas phases and pathways that allow its migration and release at the ground surface. Gas pockets trapped in the subsurface have contrasting properties with the surrounding porous media that favor their detection using geophysical methods. We have developed a case study in which pockets of gas were intercepted with multilevel monitoring wells, and their lateral continuity was monitored over time using resistivity. We have developed a novel interpretation procedure based on Archie's law to evaluate changes in water and gas content with respect to a mean background medium. We have used induced polarization data to account for errors in applying Archie's law due to the contribution of surface conductivity effects. Mosaics defined by changes in water saturation allowed the recognition of gas migration and groundwater infiltration routes and the association of gas and groundwater fluxes. The inference on flux patterns was analyzed by taking into account pressure measurements in trapped gas reservoirs and by metagenomic analysis of the microbiological content, which was retrieved from suspended sediments in groundwater sampled in multilevel monitoring wells. A conceptual model combining physical and microbiological subsurface processes suggested that biogas trapped at depth may have the ability to quickly travel to the surface.

AB Questions: What are the water economy strategies of the dominant subarctic bryophytes in terms of colony and shoot traits? Can colony water retention capacity be predicted from morphological traits of both colonies and separate shoots? Are suites of water retention traits consistently related to bryophyte habitat and phylogenetic position?
   Location: Abisko Research Station, North Sweden.
   Methods: We screened 22 abundant subarctic bryophyte species from diverse habitats for water economy traits of shoots and colonies, including desiccation rates, water content at field capacity, volume and density (mg cm(-3)) of water-saturated and oven-dried patches, evaporation rate (g . m (2) . s (1)) and cell wall thickness. The relationships between these traits and shoot and colony desiccation rates were analysed with Spearman rank correlations. Subsequent multivariate (cluster followed by PCA) analyses were based on turf density, turf and shoot desiccation rate, cell wall thickness and amount of external and internal water.
   Results: Individual shoot properties, i.e. leaf cellwall properties, water retention capacity and desiccation rate, did not correspond with colony water retention capacity. Colony desiccation rate depended on density of water-saturated colonies, and was marginally significantly negatively correlated with species individual shoot desiccation rate but not related to any other shoot or colony trait. Multivariate analyses based on traits assumed to determine colony desiccation rate revealed six distinct species groups reflecting habitat choice and phylogenetic relationships.
   Conclusions: General relationships between shoot and colony traits as determinants of water economy will help to predict and upscale changes in hydrological function of bryophyte-dominated peatlands undergoing climate-induced shifts in species abundance, and feedbacks of such species shifts on permafrost insulation and carbon sequestration functions.

AB Warming greatly reshapes carbon cycle of peatlands where soil is water saturated with anaerobic condition prevailing all the year round. However, little is known about the response of anaerobic mineralization of peatlands carbon to global warming, especially when considering the difference of soil from above water table (AWT) and below water table (BWT). This study measured variations in soil carbon anaerobic mineralization as a function of warming and depth by sampling 100-cm soil columns in Zoige plateau. Warming enhanced carbon anaerobic mineralization significantly with different increments among the whole depths. The response of CO2-C and CH4-C to warming varied with depth: at surface soil, both CO2-C and CH4-C emission increased with higher increment; at deep soil, CO2-C emission increased with small increment and CH4-C emission decreased. Substrate availability influenced carbon anaerobic mineralization rate and pathway. Substantial resistant carbon at deep soil lowered CO2 increment and varied CH4 production pathway. The temperature sensitivity of peat carbon anaerobic mineralization varied with depth, suggesting the heterogeneous distribution of soil substrate among the whole depths. AWT soil was higher in temperature sensitivity than BWT soil for the substantial simple carbon and higher microbial/enzyme activity at AWT. BWT soil was a major contributor of the amount of carbon emission and the total increased carbon caused by warming. Further, for the management of peatlands, we should conduct advanced research by focusing more towards the soil of whole depth, especially on the temperature sensitivity of AWT soil and the contribution to total carbon emission of BWT soil.

AB Biological clogging in unsaturated soils is an important concern in the design of biofilters that are used to treat wastewater in rural areas. Several conceptual models have been developed to simulate biological clogging in saturated flow systems but limited research has been performed to develop similar conceptual models in unsaturated soils. This study developed three conceptual models for biological clogging in unsaturated soils. The model formulations varied from microscale to macroscale and from analytically derived to empirical equations. They were all formulated based on the approaches proposed by Burdine and Mualem to estimate the relative permeability based on the effective water saturation and the soil moisture curve. A one-dimensional unsaturated flow and transport code was developed, which incorporates Monod kinetics to simulate the biodegradation of an organic substrate. The three conceptual models that were developed relate the relative permeability to the microbial growth term in the unsaturated flow equation. The models were implemented in a numerical model to illustrate the impact of microbial growth on the biological clogging of unsaturated soils. Also the effect of continuous loading versus pulse loading was simulated to illustrate the difference between the loading scenarios on the clogging process within biofilters.

AB The dissimilatory reduction of sulfate contributes to the retention of sulfur in acidic mineratrophic peatlands. Novel sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (SRPs) colonize these low-sulfate fens. This study assessed the community structures of SRPs in a depth gradient (0-50 cm) in a fen, located in the Fichtelgebirge (Spruce Mountains), Germany. Detection of SRPs with multiplex (terminal-) restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of amplified dissimilatory (bi)sulfite reductase genes (dsrAB) separated three subgroups derived from (i) the upper 5 and 10 cm, (ii) 15-25 cm, and (iii) 30-50 cm depth. Biogeochemical parameters measured in the soil solution from July 2001 to July 2004 documented that the upper 5-10 cm were exposed to drying and oxygenation prior to sampling. Periodic oxygenation reached a maximum depth of 25 cm in the water-saturated fen and was concomitant with relative high concentrations of nitrate (1120 mu M) and sulfate (up to 310 mu M). The fen soil was permanently anoxic below 30 cm depth with average concentrations of sulfate below 40 mu M and maximum concentrations of methane. Cloning of dsrAB PCR products from 5, 20 and 40 cm depth yielded a total of 84 unique dsrAB restriction patterns. Partial sequencing of 61 distinct clones resulted in 59 unique partial protein sequences that mainly clustered with DsrA sequences of uncultivated sulfate reducers. Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans- and Syntrophobacter wolinfi-related bacteria appeared to be present only in 40 cm depth. Differences in the SRP community structures suggested that SRPs present in the upper fen soil have to tolerate O-2 and even drying, whereas SRPs present in deep anoxic zones may act as syntrophic fermentors in cooperation with H-2-utilizing methanogens.

ID ORGANIC-MATTER; FOREST-FIRES; DEGRADATION; SEDIMENTS
AB Amount, stability, and distribution of black carbon ( BC) were studied at four sites of a large peatland ("Witzwil") formerly used as a disposal for combustion residues from households to derive BC displacement rates in the profile. Possible artefacts from thermal oxidation with Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) on BC quantification of C-rich deposits were inferred by choosing three sites from a second peatland with no historical record of waste disposal as a reference ("Seebodenalp"). All sites were under grassland at time of sampling, but were partially cropped in the past at Witzwil. Mean BC contents in topsoils of Witzwil ranged from 10.7 to 91.5 (0-30 cm) and from 0.44 to 51.3 (30-140 cm) mg BC g(-1) soil, corresponding to BC/OC ratios of 0.04 to 0.3 (topsoil) and 0.02 to 0.18 (deeper soil). At three sites of Seebodenalp, BC was below the detection limit of 0.4 mg g(-1) organic soil, indicating negligible formation of BC during thermal oxidation of peat. (13)C NMR spectra corroborated the high BC contents at Witzwil. The data support a considerable vertical transport of BC given that soils were ploughed not deeper than 30 cm since abandonment of waste application about 50 years ago. The total amount of BC in the Witzwil profiles ranged from 3.2 to 7.5 kg BC m(-2), with 21 to 69 percent of it stemming from below the former ploughing depth. Under the premise of negligible rates of BC consumption since abandonment of waste application, minimum BC transport rates in these peats are 0.6 to 1.2 cm a(-1). The high mobility of BC might be explained by high macropore volumes in combination with occasional water saturation. By means of DSC peak temperatures, different types of BC could be distinguished, with deeper horizons containing BC of higher thermal stability. Application of combustion residues likely involved a mixture of various BC types, of which thermally more stable ones, most likely soots, were preferentially transported downwards.

AB We explore 3 years of pore water profile data from a New Hampshire wetland to determine the rates of methane production and oxidation occurring in the water-saturated peat, and how these rates evolve over seasonal and annual timescales. For this study, pore water was collected and analyzed for the isotopic composition of the dissolved inorganic carbon and the concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane. These data are used, in conjunction with a 1-D model that simulates reaction and transport, to calculate the rates of methane production and oxidation necessary to recreate pore water profiles measured over seasonal and annual cycles from 2005 through 2007. We find column-integrated methane production rates to vary between 0 and 30 mu mol cm(-2) month(-1), averaging 6 mu mol cm(-2) month(-1) during the summer. The seasonal pattern in the depth-integrated methane production rates is observed to positively correlate with temperature change. Despite large differences in the water table depths over the years studied, we see no difference in mean methane production rates between years. Results from three different stations, each characterized by different local vegetation, do not find plant-mediated transport to be an important mechanism for methane removal from the saturated peat, although we did find evidence supporting possible oxygen leakage from roots. Significant differences were observed in subsurface respiration between the stations. We observed several instances of non-diffusive transport in both the subsurface methane and carbon dioxide pools, particularly during the early spring and late fall and hypothesize that rainfall events may contribute to significant degassing from the uppermost 40-60 cm of saturated peat. Supporting findings by an earlier study, these isotope-constrained methane production rates can only account for a fraction (between 0% and 21%) of the methane emissions from this site, indicating a source of methane at or above the pore water surface. Seasonal patterns indicate peak methanogenesis may be associated with the oxic-anoxic boundary. It remains uncertain as to whether the saturated peat should remain a focus for studies of wetland methane cycling, with this work indicating it plays only a small role in bulk methane fluxes from this site.

AB Transient numerical simulations of the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatland near the Red Lakes in Northern Minnesota were constructed to evaluate observed reversals in vertical ground-water flow. Seasonal weather changes were introduced to a ground-water flow model by varying evapotranspiration and recharge over time. Vertical hydraulic reversals, driven by changes in recharge and evapotranspiration were produced in the simulated peat layer. These simulations indicate that the high specific storage associated with the peat is an important control on hydraulic reversals. Seasonally driven vertical flow is on the order of centimeters in the deep peat, suggesting that seasonal vertical advective fluxes are not significant and that ground-water flow into the deep peat likely occurs on decadal or longer time scales. Particles tracked within the ground-water flow model oscillate over time, suggesting that seasonal flow reversals will enhance vertical mixing in the peat column. The amplitude of flow path oscillations increased with increasing peat storativity, with amplitudes of about 5 cm occurring when peat specific storativity was set to about 0.05 m(-1).

AB The mechanical properties of a silty clay loam (SCL), alone or amended with 20 or 40 % by volume of spaghnum pest, were studied at different values of water content. Cyclic uniaxial compression tests were applied using pressures of 30-500 kPa. The void ratios in the last 80 cycles are well represented by a simple function which assumes a limit value for an infinite number of cycles. The void ratio of moist or very moist silty clay loam compressed at 500 kPa is increased to about 55 and 115 % for 20 and 40 % peat contents, respectively. A comparison of the cyclic test with an oedometer (consolidometer) test yields similar results under unsaturated conditions. When the initial degree of saturation is greater than 0.5 and the initial void ratio is greater than 0.9, the compactibility is seen to increase for all the studied materials. A mixing model is used to study SCL and organic matter interaction under different water saturation conditions. ((C) Inra/Elsevier, Paris.)

AB In contrast to the pervasive occurrence of denitrification in soils, anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation) is a spatially restricted process that depends on specific ecological conditions. To identify the factors that constrain the distribution and activity of anammox bacteria in terrestrial environments, we investigated four different soil types along a catena with opposing ecological gradients of nitrogen and water content, from an amended pasture to an ombrotrophic bog. Anammox was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) only in the nitrophilic wet meadow and the minerotrophic fen, in soil sections remaining water-saturated for most of the year and whose interstitial water contained inorganic nitrogen. Contrastingly, aerobic ammonia oxidizing microorganisms were present in all examined samples and outnumbered anammox bacteria usually by at least one order of magnitude. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed a relatively high diversity of anammox bacteria with one Ca. Brocadia cluster. Three additional clusters could not be affiliated to known anammox genera, but have been previously detected in other soil systems. Soil incubations using N-15-labeled substrates revealed that anammox processes contributed about <2% to total N-2 formation, leaving nitrification and denitrification as the dominant N-removal mechanism in these soils that represent important buffer zones between agricultural land and ombrotrophic peat bogs.

AB Investigations on soil and freshwater acidification are usually focused on well-aerated systems. This study deals with the role of reductive processes for the neutralization of acid soil solution within helocrene springs. Two toposequences consisting each of three profiles (forest soil, margin of fen, fen) were established to study the chemistry of the solid phase (soil pH, CEC, pedogenic Fe-and Al-oxides) and the soil solution in two small spring catchments on three dates during 1991 and 1992. Despite high acid inputs and acidified forest soils the pH of the spring outflow is near neutral, and the soil solid phases of the spring fens are not acidified. The results support the following hypothesis: Aluminum with its corresponding anion sulfate is leached with the soil solution into the water-saturated fens. Dissimilatory iron and sulfate reduction take place within the fen and generate alkalinity. Reduced iron either reacts with sulfide to form pyrite or migrates within the fen profile and precipitates in the uppermost, oxic horizons, consuming part of the generated alkalinity. Due to the higher pH values in the fens the incoming aluminum precipitates releasing acidity. The alkalinity generated exceeds the amount of acidity released by oxidation and precipitation of iron and the precipitation of aluminum. A balance of alkalinity consuming and alkalinity generating processes based on solid phases showed that iron and sulfate reduction can account for at least 67% of the neutralization of acidity entering the fen of one of the catchments. Due to shorter water retention times and higher discharge these processes are of minor importance in the other catchment.

AB The risk stemming from human exposure to actinides via the groundwater track has motivated numerous studies on the transport of radionuclides within geologic environments; however, the effects of waterborne organic matter on radionuclide mobility are still poorly understood. In this study, we compared the abilities of three humic acids (HAs) (obtained through sequential extraction of a peat soil) to cotransport hexavalent uranium (U) within water-saturated sand columns. Relative breakthrough concentrations of U measured upon elution of 18 pore volumes increased from undetectable levels (<0.001) in an experiment without HAs to 0.17 to 0.55 in experiments with HAs. The strength of the HA effect on U mobility was positively correlated with the hydrophobicity of organic matter and NMR-detected content of alkyl carbon, which indicates the possible importance of hydrophobic organic matter in facilitating U transport. Carbon and uranium elemental maps collected with a scanning transmission X-ray microscope (STXM) revealed uneven microscale distribution of U. Such molecular- and column-scale data provide evidence for a critical role of hydrophobic organic matter in the association and cotransport of U by HAs. Therefore, evaluations of radionuclide transport within subsurface environments should consider the chemical characteristics of waterborne organic substances, especially hydrophobic organic matter.

AB Peatlands are long-term sinks of atmospheric carbon (C) largely due to water-saturated soil conditions, decay-resistant plant litter, and the presence of biochemical compounds such as soluble phenolics. As phenolics are known inhibitors of microbial enzymes in soils, the concept of the 'enzymic latch' on peat C was introduced, assuming that phenolics accumulate in peat water due to protection from degradation by oxidative enzymes as a result of anoxia. However, their inhibitory role in peat has not been unambiguously confirmed.
   We aimed to verify whether peat phenolics inhibit microbial and enzyme activities in laboratory-incubated Sphagnum litter, and bog and fen peat. Soluble humic substances were extracted from bog water as a source of natural phenolics and separated into two molecular-weight fractions. We tested the effects of (1) phenolics concentration, (2) their molecular weight and (3) anoxia on the activity of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes, and on microbial respiration rate.
   The added phenolics did not suppress hydrolytic enzyme activities nor microbial respiration. Quite the contrary, phenolics addition (up to 1000 mg L-1) sometimes supported enzyme and microbial activities, indicating that phenolics (or another constituent of peat humic substances) served as a source of C. The activities of hydrolytic enzymes did not vary between oxic and anoxic peat but were double in oxic than anoxic conditions in Sphagnum litter. Differences in enzymatic and microbial activities were driven by peat type with about three times greater microbial respiration rates and enzyme activities in fen peats.
   Our results do not support the concept of the enzymic latch, particularly its key assumption that peat phenolics inhibit hydrolytic enzymes. While the concept was established on oceanic peatlands with low phenolic concentrations, the peat microbial community in our experiments seemed acclimated to the naturally high phenolic concentrations, characteristic for other, non-oceanic northern peatlands. Thus, the enzymic latch should not be considered as a determinative mechanism preserving the global C store in peatlands. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Altered andesites interstratified with are-related sedimentary rocks of the Tamworth Group, New England Fold Belt represent submarine intrusions and extrusions of an Early Devonian volcanic chain. Two emplacement histories are represented: unnamed andesites emplaced as a series of discontinuous intrusions in poorly consolidated, water-saturated sediments of the Bog Hole Formation; and the Copes Creek Andesite emplaced as a submarine volcanic centre in volcaniclastic breccias of the Drik Drik Formation. Andesites in both units are extensively brecciated due to the quenching and fragmentation of magma that came into contact with water. These 'hyaloclastite' breccias are locally characterised by in situ fragmentation textures; angular, splintery fragments; and convex-concave edges of clasts. The andesite intrusions in the Bog Hole Formation form lens-shaped bodies that range from thin (< 180 m), elongate masses that are highly brecciated to thicker bodies (> 300 m) that exhibit only minor brecciation. These variations reflect changing conditions of the host sediment during intrusion and are similar to Neogene submarine volcanic facies described from Central Japan. The remnant volcanic centre in the Drik Drik Formation is represented by a narrow lens of discontinuous, distinctly brecciated masses. The centre formed largely by intrusion into wet sediments, magma locally extruding onto the sea floor and producing abundant hyaloclastic debris. Following large-scale erosion, the volcanic centre was overlain by successive mass-flow units.

AB Peat soils with a gradient of naturally high Cd and Zn (up to 190 and 70,000 mg/kg, respectively) were sampled at several depths from a wetland overlying Zn-rich dolomitic bedrock. Total concentrations of Zn, Cd and S were generally much higher in the seasonally water-saturated subsoils than at the surface. Leaching studies with intact soil columns showed the subsoils generally have a greater tendency to release Zn, Cd and S than the topsoils. Zn and Cd leaching were correlated to sulfate dissolution, with 6 successive leaching events removing up to 4% and 13% of the total Zn and S, respectively, from the most metal-rich subsoils. Relative leaching losses were less from the surface soils, not exceeding 1% and 3% of total Zn and S. Because Zn was relatively more soluble and extractable by 0.01 M CaCl2 than Cd, Zn/Cd ratios in column leachates and field-sampled groundwater were higher than the soil Zn/Cd ratios. Consequently, the potential for loss of Zn from the soil by leaching was higher than that of Cd, particularly from the subsoil. Nevertheless, some soil layers of the profile were enriched in total Zn relative to Cd, indicated by Zn/Cd ratios well above that of the Cd-rich sphalerite in the parent dolomitic rock. This enrichment may be explained by historical migration and re-immobilization of Zn as sulfides. The low solubility of Cd in the peats despite high total Cd suggests preferential immobilization of this metal by organic sulfur or sulfide.

AB Concomitant with farmland development in the Ishikari Peatland of northern Japan, deterioration of water chemistry has become increasingly evident at mire pools there. Using spatial analysis methods with a geographic information system and a statistical methodology, this study examined the effects of agricultural land use on the pool water chemistry. A water chemistry survey of several pools showed that nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended-solid concentrations were remarkably higher than those in pools that had been undisturbed or less-disturbed by land-use development. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to summarize water chemistry variables. Correlation analysis was conducted between the principal component (PC) scores and land-use variables to clarify land-use effects. Results of the PCA showed that the water chemistry variances were accounted for by the first two PCs: PC1 included farmland subsurface drainage containing nitrogen, specifically nitrate, and mineral ions; PC2 included farmland surface drainage containing soil particles and ammonium nitrogen. These PC scores were also affected by the number of inflow ditches and the total area of farmland located within the drainage catchment of inflow ditches leading to the pools. Results suggest that farmland subsurface and surface drainage water flowing into the pools degraded the water chemistry. The extent of the effects of drainage water depended on agricultural practices such as fertilizer application and paddy-field puddling (i.e., mechanical homogenization of water-saturated soil). Accordingly, water chemistry of the study pools was affected by agricultural practices and by the amount of farmland in the drainage basin, engendering eutrophication, and the deterioration of water chemistry. Therefore, preservation of water chemistry necessitates changes in agricultural practices, such as improving fertilizer application methods, along with measures related to land-use planning such as changing the drainage ditches' flow direction.

AB It is widely accepted that the accumulation of gypsum in gypsiferous soils results in very low fertility, even with application of fertilizers and organic amendments. The objectives were to investigate, in laboratory experiments, the effect of gypsum on the solubility of 13 nutrients and how amending the soil with organic peat moss may mitigate the impact of gypsum on nutrients and soil fertility. A 100-g sample of gypsum-free soil (Sharpsburg Fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Typic Argiudolls) was treated with increasing amounts of gypsum (0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 50 g), then water was added to the mixtures to reach 50% of the water saturation capacity. Another set of soil/gypsum mixtures received 5-g peat to study the effect of peat application. All mixtures were incubated at 32 degrees C for 15 weeks. After incubation, the concentration of water-soluble nutrients was measured. In general, the addition of gypsum increased the solubility of N, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Cl, and S, whereas it decreased the solubility of P, Na, Fe, Cu, Zn, and B. The application of peat increased the solubility of all nutrients investigated, except for N and S. Chemical reactions and mechanisms were applied to interpret the effects of both gypsum and peat treatments on nutrient solubility and their relationship to soil fertility and crop production. The application of peat improved the solubility of most nutrients and proved to be useful as an amendment for gypsum-rich soils and increases its productivity.

AB The abundance of Juncus effusus (soft rush) and Juncus conglomeratus (compact rush) has increased in coastal grasslands in Norway over recent decades, and their spread has coincided with increased precipitation in the region. Especially in water-saturated, peaty soils, it appears from field observations that productive grasses cannot compete effectively with such rapidly growing rush plants. In autumn-winters of 2012-2013 and 2013-2014, a four-factor, randomised block greenhouse experiment was performed to investigate the effect of different soil moisture regimes and organic matter contents on competition between these rush species and smooth meadow-grass (Poa pratensis). The rush species were grown in monoculture and in competition with the meadow-grass, using the equivalent of full and half the recommended seed rate for the latter. After about three months, above- and below-ground dry matter was measured. J. effusus had more vigorous growth, producing on average 23-40% greater biomass in both fractions than J. conglomeratus. The competitive ability of both rush species declined with decreasing soil moisture; at the lowest levels of soil moisture, growth reductions were up to 93% in J. conglomeratus and 74% in J. effusus. Increasing water level in peat-sand mixture decreased competivitiveness of meadow-grass, while pure peat, when moist, completely impeded its below-ground development. These results show that control of rush plants through management may only be achieved if basic soil limitations have been resolved.

TI Resistivity and georadar mapping of lacustrine and glaciofluvial
   sediments in the late-glacial to postglacial Store Amose basin, Denmark
SO BULLETIN OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF DENMARK
LA English
DT Article
AB Resistivity profiling, resistivity sounding, georadar profiling and analyses of borings are used in a sedimentological and geomorphological study of shallow subsurface deposits in the proximal (southeastern) part of the Store Amose lacustrine basin in eastern Denmark. Areas of low, intermediate and high resistivities are located by resistivity profiling. Low-resistivity areas (type I) correspond to a thick unit of water-saturated lake sediments (fine detritus gyttja and silt/clay) which were deposited in a large lake system from the late Weichselian to the late Holocene. In intermediate-resistivity areas (type II), a relatively thick top layer of fresh-water peat and drifted gyttja or dry gyttja occurs. Fine-grained lake sediments, drifted gyttja and peat are equivalent to transparent facies and low penetration (max. c. 2 m) in georadar profiles. Resistivity soundings indicate a shallower high-resistive substratum of meltwater sand and gravel in type II areas than in type I areas. The lake and fen sediments fill a highly irregular lake bottom relief, interpreted to have been formed in glaciofluvial channel systems and as dead-ice holes during the final Weichselian deglaciation. Sandy and gravelly domes and ridges, interpreted as proximal glaciofluvial deposits, are exposed at the ground surface in high-resistivity areas (type III). Convex surfaces of glaciofluvial bars and sides of meltwater channels are distinct georadar reflectors. Shallow, glaciofluvial bars were islands in the Holocene lake system and surrounding intermediate-resistivity areas represent shore zones of these islands (possible settlement areas).

AB Northern wetlands play a key role in the global carbon budget, particularly in the budgets of the greenhouse gas methane. These ecosystems also determine the hydrology of northern rivers and represent one of the largest reservoirs of fresh water in the Northern Hemisphere. Sphagnum-dominated peat bogs and fens are the most extensive types of northern wetlands. In comparison to many other terrestrial ecosystems, the bacterial diversity in Sphagnum-dominated wetlands remains largely unexplored. As demonstrated by cultivation-independent studies, a large proportion of the indigenous microbial communities in these acidic, cold, nutrient-poor, and water-saturated environments is composed of as-yet-uncultivated bacteria with unknown physiologies. Most of them are slow-growing, oligotrophic microorganisms that are difficult to isolate and to manipulate in the laboratory. Yet, significant breakthroughs in cultivation of these elusive organisms have been made during the last decade. This article describes the major prerequisites for successful cultivation of peat-inhabiting microbes, gives an overview of the currently captured bacterial diversity from northern wetlands and discusses the unique characteristics of the newly discovered organisms.

AB Warming Arctic temperatures have led to permafrost thaw that threatens to release previously sequestered mercury (Hg) back into the environment. Mobilisation of Hg in permafrost waters is of concern, as Hg methylation produced under water-saturated conditions results in the neurotoxin, methyl Hg (MeHg). Thawing permafrost may enhance Hg export, but the magnitude and mechanisms of this mobilisation within Arctic ecosystems remain poorly understood. Such uncertainty limits prognostic modelling of Hg mobilisation and impedes a comprehensive assessment of its threat to Arctic ecosystems and peoples. Here, we address this knowledge gap through an assessment of Hg dynamics across a well-studied permafrost thaw sequence at the peak of the growing season in biologically active peat overlying permafrost, quantifying total gaseous mercury (TGM) fluxes, total mercury (Hg-Tot) in the active layer peat, porewater MeHg concentrations, and identifying microbes with the potential to methylate Hg. During the initial thaw, TGM is liberated, likely by photoreduction from permafrost where it was previously stored for decades to centuries. As thawing proceeds, TGM is largely driven by hydrologic changes as evidenced by Hg accumulation in water-logged, organic-rich peat sediments in fen sites. MeHg in porewaters increase across the thaw gradient, a pattern coincident with increases in the relative abundance of microbes possibly containing genes allowing for methylation of ionic Hg. Findings suggest that under changing climate, frozen, well-drained habitats will thaw and collapse into saturated landscapes, increasing the production of MeHg and providing a significant source of the toxic, bioaccumulative contaminant.

AB Boreal peatlands, a major source of atmospheric CH4, are characterized by a rapidly fluctuating water table position and meter-scale variations in relief. Regional and ecosystem-based studies show that water table position generally controls CH4 emission from boreal peatlands by influencing the relative extent of the zones of CH4 oxidation and production within the peat profile. We used a combined field and laboratory study to assess the influence of local hydrology on the short-term dynamics of CH4 production, oxidation, and emission from sites in an Alaskan boreal peatland that were characterized by temporarily (site LB1A) and permanently (LB2) water-saturated subsurface peat during the thaw season. The two sites contrasted sharply with respect to the dynamics of CH4 cycling. Site LB1A, which showed low CH4 concentrations in pore water (<2 mu M) and unsaturated peat (<2.6 nM), consumed both atmospheric CH4 and CH4 diffusing upward from the saturated zone for a net flux of 0.9 mg CH4 m(2) d(1). In contrast, LB2 had pore water CH4 concentrations, 300 mu M and emitted CH4 at 69 mg m(2) d(1). Roughly 55% of the CH4 diffusing upward from the saturated zone at LB2 was oxidized in transit to the peat surface. Methane oxidation potentials (V-ox) were maximum in the 10-cm zone immediately above the local water table at both sites but were greater on a dry mass (dw) basis at LB2 (498-650 ng CH4 g(dw)(1) h(1)) than at LB1A (220-233 ng CH4 g(dw)(1) h(1)). Methane production potentials (V-p) were low (<2 ng CH4 g(dw)(1) h(1)) at LB1A, but the maximum at LB2 (139 ng CH4 g(dw)(1) h(1)) was spatially coupled with the maximum V-ox. Methanogens exposed to O-2 produced no CH4 in a subsequent 48 h anoxic incubation, whereas methanotrophs incubated anoxically oxidized CH4 vigorously within 20 h of return to an oxic environment, indicating that the former are more sensitive than the latter to adverse O-2 conditions. Experiments with (CH4)-C-14 showed that similar to 71% of assimilated (CH4)-C-14 was respired as (CO2)-C-14. Respiration by methanotrophs contributes at most similar to 1.1-1.7% (molar basis) of gross ecosystem respiration (15.6-17.9 mg CO2 m(2) d(1)) at these sites.

AB Drainage turns peatlands from natural carbon sinks into hotspots of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from soils due to alterations in hydrological and biogeochemical processes. As a consequence of drainage-induced mineralisation and anthropogenic sand addition, large areas of former peatlands under agricultural use have soil organic carbon (SOC) contents at the boundary between mineral and organic soils. Previous research has shown that the variability of GHG emissions increases with anthropogenic disturbance. However, how and whether sand addition affects GHG emissions remains a controversial issue. The aim of this long-term incubation experiment was to assess the influence of hydrological and biogeochemical soil properties on emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Strongly degraded peat with sand addition (peat-sand mixtures) and without sand addition (earthified peat) was systematically compared under different moisture conditions for fen and bog peat. Soil columns originating from both the topsoil and the subsoil of ten different peatlands under grassland use were investigated. Over a period of six months the almost saturated soil columns were drained stepwise via suction to -300 hPa. The CO2 fluxes were lowest at water-saturated and dry soil moisture conditions, resulting in a parabolic dependence of CO2 fluxes on the water-filled pore space (WFPS) peaking at 56-92% WFPS. The highest N2O fluxes were found at between 73 and 95% WFPS. Maximum CO2 fluxes were highest from topsoils, ranging from 21 to 77 mg C m(-2) h(-1), while the maximum CO2 fluxes from subsoils ranged from 3 to 14 mg C m(-2) h(-1). No systematic influence of peat type or sand addition on GHG emissions was found in topsoils, but CO2 fluxes from subsoils below peat-sand mixtures were higher than from subsoils below earthified peat. Maximum N2O fluxes were highly variable between sites and ranged from 18.5 to 234.9 and from 0.2 to 22.9 mu g N m-2 h-1 for topsoils and subsoils, respectively. CH4 fluxes were negligible even under water-saturated conditions. The highest GHG emissions occurred at a WFPS that relates - under equilibrium conditions - to a water table of 20-60 cm below the surface in the field. High maximum CO2 and N2O fluxes were linked to high densities of plant-available phosphorus and potassium. The results of this study highlight that nutrient status plays a more important role in GHG emissions than peat type or sand addition, and do not support the idea of peat-sand mixtures as a mitigation option for GHG emissions.

AB Nocturnal buoyancy-driven water flow in bogs is proposed as a mechanism to replenish the nutrient availability in the top of the acrotelm. In an earlier paper, we provided evidence for buoyancy-driven water flow on theoretical and experimental grounds. In this paper, field evidence is given for the occurrence of nocturnal buoyancy cells. Measurements in a small isolated bog in the Netherlands showed that temperature differences between day and night and hydraulic conductivity resulted in a Rayleigh number that is sufficiently high to induce buoyancy flow. Irregularities between diurnal heating and nocturnal cooling gave evidence that indeed convective heat exchange occurred. Moreover, we observed a temperature rise at 5-10 cm depth around midnight, which would be expected on theoretical grounds if buoyancy-driven water flow occurs. Furthermore, the oxygen cycles at 5 cm depth showed an irregularity, which exactly matched the temperature irregularity. This also strongly suggests that buoyancy-driven water flow occurred. Nutrient samples taken from the same ombrotrophic bog showed a significant increase in the concentrations of NH4+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and CO2 with depth, whereas K+ showed a significant decrease with depth indicating that buoyancy-driven water flow may potentially redistribute these nutrients. The size of the buoyancy cells was assessed under controlled conditions in a peat core taken from the bog. We observed two spots of upward flow of warm water and two spots of downward flow of cold water. The cell sizes were approximately 25-100 cm(2). We conclude that nocturnal buoyancy-driven water flow occurs in the field were it may be an important mechanism for relocation of oxygen and nutrients. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although extensive research has been conducted to understand the effects of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on fine particle transport, less attention has been paid to natural organic matter (NOM) in the transport medium (i.e., immobile rock and sediment grains). The objective of this study is to elucidate the roles of NOM in the transport medium in mediating particle transport. We conducted experimental and modelling study on the transport of nanoscale titanium dioxide (nTiO(2)) and illite colloid in columns packed with quartz sand under water-saturated conditions. Peat moss was used as an example NOM and packed in some of the columns to investigate its influence on particle transport. Experimental results showed that NOM may either increase or decrease particle transport depending on the specific conditions. NOM in the transport medium was found to attract particles and reduce particle mobility when the energy barrier between particle and NOM is low or non-existent. NOM also adsorb to Fe and Al oxyhydroxides and promote the transport of negatively-charged particles at low pH. Partial dissolution of NOM releases DOM, and the DOM adsorbs to and increases the transport of positively-charged particles. Additionally, NOM changes pore water pH, which influences particle mobility by affecting the interaction energy between the particle and transport medium. Modelling results showed that the deposition sites provided by peat moss are very heterogeneous, and the NOM from peat moss may reduce particle deposition rate by adsorbing to the particle and/or transport medium. Findings from this study demonstrate that NOM in the transport medium not only changes property of the medium, but also may alter water chemistry. Therefore, the role of NOM in mediating particle transport is complicated and dependent on the property of the particle, NOM, and mineralogical composition of the medium. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Rewetting of bogs after peat extraction in eutrophied, agricultural areas often results in mono-species stands of Juncus effusus L. In contrast to typical peat forming vegetation such as Sphagnum, J. effusus is highly productive and supplies large amounts of labile carbon, but it is still unknown how this species affects biogeochemistry and the potential of restored peatlands to store carbon. To study degradation of T. effusus litter of different quality and its effect on peat decomposition, we conducted a full-factorial, anaerobic incubation with dried, C-13 labelled litter (roots and shoots) of fertilized (C/N ratio 19.6, C/P ratio 55.3) and non -fertilized plants (C/N ratio 57.8, C/P ratio 304.5). We furthermore analyzed weakly (fibric) to highly (earthyfied) humified, and acidic Sphagnum-Eriophorum peat from three different rewetted and active peat extraction sites of the temperate, nemoral NW German Plain. Materials were incubated fully water saturated at 15 degrees C for 70 days; peat-only and litter incubations served as controls to the full-factorial re-combination of peat and litter. By this experimental design, we investigated the effect of fertilization on litter degradability, decomposition rates of litter in relation to peat, and the controls on decomposition rates to explain potential priming effects by recombination of fresh organic carbon and refractory peat. Surprisingly, fertilization of J. effusus only insignificantly affected decomposition rates between litter types. Decomposition rates of J. effusus litter were 2-18 times higher than of peat, and spectroscopic analysis of the organic matter confirmed the lability of litter and its leachates in comparison to peat. Decomposition rates were equally controlled (73% variance explained) by availability of terminal electron acceptors and the activity of hydrolyzing enzymes. However, hydrolase activity was strongly negatively correlated (R-2=0.95, P < 0.05) with aromaticity, suggesting an inhibitory effect. Furthermore, upon combination of litter and peat, litter was preferentially decomposed. Litter amendments in general lead to faster depletion of electron acceptors. Thus, in these anaerobic incubations, electron acceptor availability limited a priming effect on the comparably refractory peat, and importantly, input of labile carbon from J. effusus did not compromise the preservation of peat. Instead, rapid exhaustion of electron acceptors may even lead to preservation of this comparably readily decomposable plant litter.

TI Ecosystem sentinels for climate change? Evidence of wetland cover

AB While the impacts of climate change on individual species and communities have been well documented there is little evidence on climate-mediated changes for entire ecosystems. Pristine alpine environments can provide unique insights into natural, physical and ecological response to climate change yet broad scale and long-term studies on these potential 'ecosystem sentinels' are scarce. We addressed this issue by examining cover changes of 1689 high-elevation wetlands (temporarily or perennial water-saturated grounds) in the Bolivian Cordillera Real, a region that has experienced significant warming and glacier melting over the last 30 years. We combined high spatial resolution satellite images from PLEIADES with the long-term images archive from LANDSAT to 1) examine environmental factors (e.g., glacier cover, wetland and watershed size) that affected wetland cover changes, and 2) identify wetlands' features that affect their vulnerability (using habitat drying as a proxy) in the face of climate change. Over the (1984-2011) period, our data showed an increasing trend in the mean wetland total area and number, mainly related to the appearance of wet grassland patches during the wetter years. Wetland cover also showed high inter-annual variability and their area for a given year was positively correlated to precipitation intensities in the three months prior to the image date. Also, round wetlands located in highly glacierized catchments were less prone to drying, while relatively small wetlands with irregularly shaped contours suffered the highest rates of drying over the last three decades. High Andean wetlands can therefore be considered as ecosystem sentinels for climate change, as they seem sensitive to glacier melting. Beyond the specific focus of this study, our work illustrates how satellite-based monitoring of ecosystem sentinels can help filling the lack of information on the ecological consequences of current and changing climate conditions, a common and crucial issue especially in less-developed countries.

AB A contrast in the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of atmospherically derived Sr (similar to0.710) and Sr from regional bedrock (>0.730) allows quantification of the proportions of precipitation recharge and groundwater discharge into peat columns of bogs and fens in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands. Two contrasting bog-fen pairs were studied: the Lost River peatland located over a regional groundwater discharge zone and the Red Lake peatland situated atop a hydrologic divide where recharge is expected to occur. Bog pore waters consist of 90-100% precipitation in the upper 2 m, below which they mix with groundwater. Adjacent fens consist mostly of groundwater, ranging from similar to 30% near the surface to similar to 100% with depth. At the Red Lake peatland, mixing relations suggest an additional Sr source that may be peat mineralization. Distinct Sr-87/Sr-86 and [Ca]/[Sr] ratios for groundwater discharging into bog and fen sites are indicative of distinct groundwater sources and are likely indicative of flow paths at two different length scales.

AB Relationships between soil C and N stocks and soil formation, climate, and vegetation were investigated in a gridded database connected to the National Forest Inventory in Norway. For mineral soil orders, C and N stocks were estimated to be 11.1-19.3 kg C.m(-2) and 0.41-0.78 kg N.m(-2), respectively, declining in the following order: Gleysols > Podzols > Brunisols > Regosols. Organic peat-type soils stored, on average, 31.3 kg C.m(-2) and 1.10 kg N.m(-2), whereas shallow Organic folisols stored, on average, 10.2 kg C.m(-2) and 0.34 kg N.m(-2). For Norway's 120 000 km(2) of forest, the total of soil C stocks was estimated to be 1.83 Gt C, with a 95% CI of 1.71-1.95 Gt C. Podzolic soils comprise the largest soil group and store approximately 50% of the forest soil C. Sixty percent of the soil C stock in Podzolic soils was stored in the mineral soil, increasing with temperature and precipitation. Poorly drained soil types store approximately 47% of the total forest soil C in Norway. Soils with water saturation have large C stocks mainly in the forest floor, suggesting that they are more susceptible to forest management and environmental change. Soil C stocks under pine and spruce forests were similar, although pine forests had larger C stocks in the forest floor, while spruce forests had the highest C stocks in the mineral soil compartment. C stocks in the forest floor increase from dry to moist ground vegetation, while ground vegetation nutrient classes reflect better the C and N stocks in the mineral soil.

AB This paper provides an assessment of existing airborne baseline geophysical data in relation to the hydrogeological characterization of protected groundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems (wetlands) in Anglesey, Wales. The attenuation of the radiometric data identifies the main areas of water saturation in the very near surface. The radiometric data have the potential to identify additional areas where similar degrees of saturation exist. The data may therefore be used to help define extensions to existing site boundaries and to provide information in the assessment of new wetland areas. The radiometric data also show regional-scale transition from the Carboniferous Limestone in the east, important for water supply to the wetlands, to older more impermeable strata to the west. The conductivity data appear capable of mapping the lateral extent of clay accumulations, concealed below peat cover which can act as a confining layer to the bedrock aquifer. At the regional scale the data reveal the extent of a former Holocene lake system and the hydrogeological control of a Carboniferous limestone-sandstone contact. The data therefore provide a non-invasive spatially continuous, characterization of the sites, improving the understanding of their dynamic water balances and, potentially, guiding further ground assessments and invasive investigations.

AB Molecular phylogenetic approaches have begun to outline the origin, distribution and diversity of actinorhizal partners. Geographic isolation of Frankia and its host plants resulting from shifting continents and dispersal patterns have apparently led to the development of Frankia genotypes with differing affinities for host genera, even within the same plant family. Actinorhizal plant genera of widespread global distribution tend to nodulate readily even outside their native ranges. These taxa may maintain infective Frankia populations of considerable diversity on a broad scale. Arid environments seem to have distinctive actinorhizal partnerships, with smaller and more specific sets of Frankia symbionts. This has led to the hypothesis that some host families have taxa that are evolving towards narrow strain specificity, perhaps because of drier habitats where fewer Frankia strains would be able to survive. Harsh conditions such as water-saturated soils near lakes, swamps or bogs that are typically acidic and low in oxygen may similarly lessen the diversity of Frankia strains present in the soil, perhaps limiting the pool of frankiae available for infection locally and, at a larger scale, for natural selection of symbiotic partnerships with host plants. Recent molecular ecological studies have also provided examples of Frankia strain sorting by soil environment within higher order cluster groupings of Frankia host specificity. Future frontiers for ecological research on Frankia and actinorhizal plants include the soil ecosystem and the genome of Frankia and its hosts.

AB The rate of sorption of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) onto a natural sandy soil in water-saturated soil columns was measured. Desorption rates were also measured after allowing the solute-sorbent system to equilibrate during a no-flow period, ranging from 3 to 49 d. Two-site equilibrium/kinetic and Gamma-distributed rate sorption models were then used to determine a single set of sorption parameters that could describe both the uptake and desorption of 1,2-DCB from these columns. Ninety-five percent confidence regions for the mass transfer rates and the two-site parameters were generated. Both the Gamma-distribution model and the two-site model could describe uptake and desorption with a single set of parameters, although the Gamma-distribution model was better at the 95% confidence level in three of five experiments. There was no statistically significant change in the sorption parameters between 3 and 49 d of no-flow. Allowing the Gamma-distributions of rates to differ between uptake and desorption improved the ability to fit the observed data, and for some experiments it could be concluded with 95% confidence that the rate of desorption is different than the rate of uptake.

AB Sorption of organic cations to soil organic matter was studied using dynamic column experiments with different compositions of electrolytes in aqueous eluents. The sorption affinity of the tested variety of charged compounds, including primary, secondary, and tertiary amines and quaternary ammonium compounds, all showed the same response to different medium compositions. The sorption affinity to Pahokee peat (i) strongly decreased with increasing electrolyte concentration, up to a factor 250 due to tested electrolyte compositions alone, (ii) was higher in NaCl solutions than in CaCl2 solutions of similar ionic strength, and (iii) was more sensitive to a decrease in NaCl than to a decrease in CaCl2, though the selectivity coefficients were not significantly different. For a weak base that was tested in eluent pH either above or below its pK(a) we demonstrated that the sorption affinity of (iv) the neutral base was hardly affected by different electrolyte compositions, comparable to a neutral reference compound, (v) the protonated weak base was strongly affected by different electrolyte compositions, and (vi) the protonated base was in the same range, or stronger, compared to the neutral base. Mass action law equations for ion-exchange reactions predicted similar trends in a qualitative but not in a quantitative way. More complex models are required to fully account for the contributions of ionic interactions to the sorption of organic cations. These results imply that risk assessment models for organic bases should take ion-exchange processes into account when estimating soil sorption coefficients and bioavailability.

AB Decomposition of leaf litter from a black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.) forest on a fen (peat soil) in Northern Germany was studied at two sites within the forest. The 'wet' site was adjacent to a lake and soil was water-saturated throughout most of the year. In contrast, the other site was substantially drier, especially in summer and therefore called the 'dry' site. The pH (H2O) value of the topsoils (horizon below litter) at the wet and dry site was 6.0 and 3.5, respectively. The litter consisted mainly of alder leaves and decomposed at different rates at the two sites. After 12 months, about 40% of the initial litter was decomposed at the dry site compared to 90% at the wet site. The water content of the litter varied seasonally, particularly at the dry site. The pH of the litter was similar to or higher than that in the underlying topsoil and decreased at the dry site after 18 months. The total C content in residual material did not change during the course of decomposition. The microbial biomass content was, with some irregularities, similar throughout the first months and then continually declined. Basal respiration decreased from an initial value of approximately 700 to 100 mu g CO2 g(-1) dry litter h(-1) after 17 months. beta-Glucosidase activity also continuously decreased during litter decomposition; protease activity decreased initially but then tended to increase. The metabolic quotient declined during the course of litter decomposition from a relatively high value to a value almost typical for soils. This decline indicates an increase in the C utilization efficiency of the microbial community as well as a shift from a zymogenous to an autochthonous microflora. Regression analyses were performed to determine correlations between properties and to evaluate factors controlling the decomposition process. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB The habitat conditions in a mire on the southern Alps of Italy were defined based on data on topography, hydrology, water chemistry, peat chemistry and floristic composition. Water flowed along the main longitudinal axis from the eastern dry sector to the western wet sector of the mire. Along the transverse axes the water table assumed a convex shape during dry periods, which resulted in water flowing towards the margins of the mire. During wet periods the water table assumed a concave shape, determining a flow of water from the margins towards the mire centre. The absence of any vertical groundwater flows enhanced habitat acidification, particularly in the eastern sector of the mire characterised by a smaller peat thickness. Surface water in the central portion of the mire had low calcium concentration and low electrical conductivity, comparable to those found in ombrotrophic bogs. Calcium concentration and electrical conductivity in surface water were higher along the margins, indicating a certain degree of mineral soil water inflow. Total contents of major nutrients (N, P and K) in the peat were rather homogeneous over the mire, while calcium concentrations were slightly higher in the peat layers of the wet portion of the mire. Species distribution was strongly influenced, rather than by surface water chemistry, by water table position and rate of surface water flow.

AB Denitrification was measured by the C2H2 inhibition technique in a riparian fen irrigated with agricultural drainage water. 16 h after C2H2 treatment 88 +/- 14% of the total N2O contained in water-saturated cores could be accounted for by assuming equilibrium between the gas phase and the liquid phase. The denitrification activity averaged 2.8 and 8.8 mg N2O-N m-2 day-1 in the control plot and 1.6 and 21.9mg N2O-N m-2 day-1 in the irrigated plot during the dry and the runoff periods respectively. Four percent of the incoming NO3- was reduced to gaseous N. The spatial variability was often high, with coefficients of variation > 100% and was independent of seasonal changes in soil anaerobiosis. Soil NO3- and denitrification were poorly related, and bulk concentrations of NO3- below 200 mum suggested that the process was strongly limited by diffusion of NO3- into the soil during periods of flooding. Mean denitrification and water-filled pores correlated positively, r = 0.71*** for the control and r = 0.68*** for the irrigated plots. Water-soluble C was not related to denitrification. Multiple regression models including soil water, NO3, soluble C and temperature as independent variables, predicted between 21 and 55% of the denitrification, the highest value found when only mean data was considered. Water-filled pores was the most important variable. The observations on which 2 variables controlled denitrification were supported by laboratory experiments with manipulated cores. Water additions increased denitrification only in samples collected during the dry period. Anaerobic incubation of saturated cores did not affect the process. Restricted NO3- availability was clearly illustrated by the 25-41-fold increase obtained when NO3- was injected into cores at ambient and high carbon respectively. A response of up to 13-fold was observed when substrate-amended cores were made into slurries. Glucose did not increase denitrification by more than a factor of three.

AB Draining fen areas seriously impairs ecosystem services as carbon ( C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) accumulation. Fen restoration has become central in management efforts to recover these ecosystem services in the face of global climate change and water eutrophication challenges. However, restoration has resulted in the creation of shallow lakes, rather than former pristine fen conditions. A new sediment layer, where C, N, and P accumulate, forms at these novel ecosystems, and differs from peat accumulation occurring in natural fens. We performed an initial estimate of C, N, and P accumulation in water inundated fens, and their potential as C, N and P sinks within the temperate area is discussed. Furthermore, the roles of topsoil removal and ecosystem age were considered. A set of abandoned peat extraction sites (n = 6), and rewetted fens (n = 6) were selected. The effects of topsoil removal prior to restoration are represented by the former sites, which were created 20-86 years ago; and the absence of topsoil removal was represented by the latter, which were established 7-20 years ago. Sediment cores were obtained, and OC, N, and P accumulation rates estimated. Fossil diatoms in the sediment layer-peat interface were evaluated to ascertain trophic conditions in the initial lake formation stages. Surface water quality was analysed to describe current trophic conditions. Our results determined C, N, and P accumulation rates at inundated fens (133.89 +/- 7.23 g C m(-2) y(-1); 9.60 +/- 0.57 g N m-2 y-1; 0.88 +/- 0.08 g P m(-2) y(-1)) were within the range of natural fens, and other temperate aquatic ecosystems. Topsoil removal prevented eutrophication, and decreased C, N, and P accumulation (P < 0.01), although it remains questionable how rewetted sites lacking topsoil removal will function in the long-term. Results demonstrated OM mineralisation has been an ongoing process in the new sediment layer for several decades, what does not occur in water saturated peat at undisturbed pristine fens.(C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Anaerobic respiration and methanogenesis have been found to slow-down in water saturated peat soils with accumulation of metabolic end-products, i.e. dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and methane (CH4), due to a lack of solute and gas transport. So far it is not well understood how solute and gas transport may control this effect. We conducted a column experiment with homogenized ombrotrophic peat over a period of 300 days at 20 A degrees C. We specifically evaluated the effects of diffusive flux as control, downward advective water flux, intensified ebullition by conduit gas transport and diffusive oxygen supply on controlling anaerobic decomposition rates and carbon (C) turnover. To simulate advective flux, water and solutes were recirculated downward through the column after stripping of dissolved gases. We analyzed DIC and CH4 concentrations, production rates and fluxes, gas filled porosity, oxygen profiles (O-2) and microbial C biomass over time. DIC residence time thereby served as proxy to characterize transport. A slowdown of anaerobic respiration and methanogenesis evolved with the accumulation of the end-products DIC and CH4 and set in after 150 days. This slow-down was accompanied by a decrease in the distribution of microbial biomass C with depths. Anaerobic DIC and CH4 production rates were fastest close to the water table and sharply slowed with depth. Accumulation of DIC and CH4 in the homogeneous peat material throughout the column decreased decomposition constants from about 10(-5) near the surface to 10(-9) year(-1) deeper in the profile. Advective water transport extended the zone of active methanogenesis compared to a diffusive system; experimental enhancement of ebullition had little or no effect as well as strictly anoxic conditions. DIC residence time was negatively correlated to anaerobic respiration suggesting this parameter to be a predictor of anaerobic peat decomposition in peatlands. Overall, this study suggests that burial of peat and accumulation of metabolic end-products effectively slows decomposition and that this effect needs to be considered to explain peat accumulation and the response of peat mineralization rates to changes in environmental conditions.

AB Soils comprise the largest terrestrial mercury (Hg) pool in exchange with the atmosphere. To predict how anthropogenic emissions affect global Hg cycling;and eventually human Hg exposure, it is crucial to understand Hg deposition and re-emission of legacy Hg from soils. However, assessing Hg deposition and re-emission pathways remains difficult because of an insufficient understanding of the governing processes. We measured Hg stable isotope signatures of radiocarbon-dated boreal forest soils and modeled atmospheric Hg deposition and re-emission pathways and fluxes using a combined source and process tracing approach. Our results suggest that Hg in the soils was dominantly derived from deposition of litter (similar to 90% on average). The remaining fraction was attributed to precipitation-derived Hg, which showed increasing contributions in older, deeper soil horizons (up to 27%) indicative of an accumulation over decades. We provide evidence for significant Hg re-emission from organic soil horizons most likely caused by nonphotochemical abiotic reduction by natural organic Matter, a process previously not observed unambiguously in nature. Our data suggest that Histosols (peat soils), which exhibit at least seasonally water-saturated conditions, have re-emitted up to one-third of previously deposited Hg back to the atmosphere. Re-emission of legacy Hg following reduction by natural organic matter may therefore be an important pathway to be considered in global models, further supporting the need for a process-based assessment of land/atmosphere Hs exchange.

AB Peatland drainage enhances tree growth, changes catchment hydrology and increases export of nutrients and suspended solids to water bodies. In this study, impacts of peatland drainage on the properties of water flow paths in terrestrial parts of catchments were assessed in terms of slope, elevation, length and soil type. Three study catchments (area 31.8-153.5 km(2)) were delineated using a 25m x 25m digital elevation model (DEM). Typical water flow paths were calculated for each catchment to characterize the mean elevation above the receiving water body as a function of distance along water flow paths. The resulting two-dimensional (2D) profile also allowed calculations of horizontally distributed properties of catchments as a function of distance to the water body. Peatland drainage decreased the length and elevation of the typical water flow path, and increased the area near water bodies. Increasing drainage from 10.7% to 55.4% of the total catchment area increased the area residing close to a water body (no farther than 25 m) from 17.1% to 60.7%. This area estimate is useful for assessing the costs of water protection, arising from restricting forestry operations in the vicinity of water bodies.

AB Forests in Europe are changing due to interactions between climate change, nitrogen (N) deposition and new forest management practices. The concurrent impact on the forest greenhouse gas (GHG) balance is at present difficult to predict due to a lack of knowledge on controlling factors of GHG fluxes and response to changes in these factors. To improve the mechanistic understanding of the ongoing changes, we studied the response of soil-atmosphere exchange of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) at twelve experimental or natural gradient forest sites, representing anticipated future forest change. The experimental manipulations, one or more per site, included N addition (4 sites), changes of climate (temperature, 1 site; precipitation, 2 sites), soil hydrology (3 sites), harvest intensity (1 site), wood ash fertilisation (1 site), pH gradient in organic soil (1 site) and afforestation of cropland (1 site).
   On average, N2O emissions increased by 0.06+/-0.03 (range 0-0.3) g N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1) across all treatments on mineral soils, but the increase was up to 10 times higher in an acidic organic soil. Soil moisture together with mineral soil C/N ratio and pH were found to significantly influence N2O emissions across all treatments. Emissions were increased by elevated N deposition, especially in interaction with increased soil moisture. High pH reduced the formation of N2O, even under otherwise favourable soil conditions.
   Oxidation (uptake) of CH4 was on average reduced from 0.16+/-0.02 to 0.04+/-0.05 g CH4-Cm-2 yr(-1) by the investigated treatments. The CH4 exchange was significantly influenced by soil moisture and soil C/N ratio across all treatments, and CH4 emissions occurred only in wet or water-saturated conditions.
   For most of the investigated forest manipulations or natural gradients, the response of both N2O and CH4 fluxes was towards reducing the overall GHG forest sink. The most resilient forests were dry Mediterranean forests, as well as forests with high soil C/N ratio or high soil pH. Mitigation strategies may focus on (i) sustainable management of wet forest areas and forested peatlands, (ii) continuous forest cover management, (iii) reducing atmospheric N input and, thus, N availability, and (iv) improving neutralisation capacity of acid soils (e.g. wood ash application).

AB A process model based on kinetic principles was developed for methane fluxes from wetlands with gas-transporting plants and a fluctuating water table. Water dynamics are modeled with the 1-D Richards equation. For temperature a standard diffusion equation is used. The depth-dependent dynamics of methane oxygen, molecular nitrogen, carbon dioxide, soil carbon, electron accepters in oxidized and in reduced form are affected by transport processes and kinetic processes. Modeled transport processes are convection and diffusion in the soil matrix, ebullition, and plant-mediated gas transport. Modeled kinetic processes are carbon mineralization, aerobic respiration, methane production, methane oxidation, electron acceptor reduction, and electron acceptor reoxidation. Concentration gradients around gas-transporting roots in water-saturated soil are accounted for by the models from the two previous papers, ensuring an explicit connection between process knowledge at the kinetic level (millimeter scale) and methane fluxes at the plot scale. We applied the model to a fen, and without any fitting simulated methane fluxes are within I order of magnitude of measured methane fluxes. The seasonal variations however, are much weaket in the simulations compared to the measurements. Simulated methane fluxes are sensitive to several uncertain parameters such as the distribution over depth of carbon mineralization, the total pool size of reduced and oxidized electron accepters, and the root-shoot ratio. Because of the process-based character of the model it is probable that these sensitivities are present in reality as well, which explains why the measured variability is usually very high. Interestingly, heterogeneities within a rooted soil layer seem to be less important than heterogeneities between different soil layers. This is due to the strong influence of the interaction between water table and profile scale processes on the oxygen input to the system and hence on net methane production. Other existing process models are discussed and compared with the presented model.

AB Methane (CH4) production, oxidation, and emission were studied in ponds of the permafrost-affected polygonal tundra in northeast Siberia. Microbial degradation of organic matter in water-saturated soils is the most important source for the climate-relevant trace gas CH4. Although ponds and lakes cover a substantial fraction of the land surface of northern Siberia, data on CH4 fluxes from these water bodies are scarce. Summer CH4 fluxes were measured with closed chambers at the margins of ponds vegetated by vascular plants and in their centers without vascular plants. Furthermore, CH4 and oxygen concentration gradients, stable carbon isotope signatures of dissolved and emitted CH4, and microbial CH4 production and CH4 oxidation were determined. Mean summer fluxes were significantly higher at the margins of the ponds (46.115.4mgCH(4)m(-2)d(-1)) than at the centers (5.98.2mgCH(4)m(-2)d(-1)). CH4 transport was dominated by diffusion in most open water sites, but substantial ebullitive fluxes (12.08.1mgCH(4)m(-2)d(-1)) were detected in one pond. Plant-mediated transport accounted for 70 to 90% of total CH4 fluxes above emerged vegetation. In the absence of vascular plants, 61 to 99% of the CH4 produced in the anoxic bottom soil was consumed in a layer of the submerged moss Scorpidium scorpioides, which covered the bottoms of the ponds. The fraction of CH4 oxidized was lower at sites with vascular plants since CH4 was predominantly transported through their aerenchyma, thereby bypassing the CH4 oxidation zone in the moss layer. These results emphasize the importance of moss-associated CH4 oxidation causing low CH4 fluxes from the studied Siberian ponds.

AB Arctic tundra ecosystems are currently facing amplified rates of climate warming. Since these ecosystems store significant amounts of soil organic carbon, which can be mineralized to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), rising temperatures may cause increasing greenhouse gas fluxes to the atmosphere. To understand how net the ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 will respond to changing climatic and environmental conditions, it is necessary to understand the individual responses of the processes contributing to NEE. Therefore, this study aimed to partition NEE at the soil-plant-atmosphere interface in an arctic tundra ecosystem and to identify the main environmental drivers of these fluxes. NEE was partitioned into gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and further into autotrophic (R-A) and heterotrophic respiration (R-H). The study examined CO2 flux data collected during the growing season in 2015 using closed-chamber measurements in a polygonal tundra landscape in the Lena River Delta, northeastern Siberia. To capture the influence of soil hydrology on CO2 fluxes, measurements were conducted at a water-saturated polygon center and a well-drained polygon rim. These chamber-measured fluxes were used to model NEE, GPP, R-eco, R-H, R-A, and net primary production (NPP) at the pedon scale (1-10 m) and to determine cumulative growing season fluxes. Here, the response of in situ measured R-A and R-H fluxes from permafrost-affected soils of the polygonal tundra to hydrological conditions have been examined. Although changes in the water table depth at the polygon center sites did not affect CO2 fluxes from R-H, rising water tables were linked to reduced CO2 fluxes from R-A. Furthermore, this work found the polygonal tundra in the Lena River Delta to be a net sink for atmospheric CO2 during the growing season. The NEE at the wet, depressed polygon center was more than twice that at the drier polygon rim. These differences between the two sites were caused by higher GPP fluxes due to a higher vascular plant density and lower R-eco fluxes due to oxygen limitation under water-saturated conditions at the polygon center in comparison to the rim. Hence, soil hydrological conditions were one of the key drivers for the different CO2 fluxes across this highly heterogeneous tundra landscape.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions from drained agricultural peatlands contribute significantly to global warming. In a laboratory study using intact cores of peat soil from eight different sites in Sweden, factors controlling the emission of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) were examined. Soil properties, and the abundance of the total microbial community (16S rRNA gene abundance), and genes encoding for functions controlling N2O emissions (bacterial and archaeal amoA, nirS, nirK, nosZI, and nosZII) were analyzed and compared against measured greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions were measured at different drainage levels, i.e., higher soil water suction values, since drainage is an important factor controlling greenhouse gas emissions from peat soils. The results showed that N2O and CH4 emissions were generally low, except for N2O emissions at near water-saturated conditions, for which three soils displayed high values and large variations in fluxes. Relationships between N2O emissions and soil properties were mainly linked to soil pH, with higher emissions at lower pH. However, specific assemblages of nitrogen cycling guilds that included nosZII, typically present in non-denitrifying N2O reducers, were detected in soils with low N2O emissions. Overall, these results indicate that both pH and biotic controls determine net N2O fluxes.

AB Wetlands represent a substantial part of Manitoba's terrestrial landscape, covering 233,340 km(2) or 43% of the province; peatlands represent 90% of all wetlands. A wetland inventory for Manitoba is presented following a classification scheme grounded in wetland function, vegetation, and landform. The province is subdivided into twelve wetland regions each having distinctive wetland types and abundances. A hybrid Detrended Canonical Correspondance Analysis (DCCA) indicates that wetland distribution in the province is largely controlled by allogenic factors of climate and physiography. The first canonical axis represents the variance in wetland distribution occurring along a north-to-south gradient within the province. In northern Manitoba, permafrost bogs dominate, replaced southwards by bogs without permafrost and fens with and without internal lawns. Farther south, peatlands are replaced by non-peat-accumulating wetlands. This wetland distributional gradient is most strongly correlated to mean annual temperature, with thermal seasonal aridity, annual precipitation, and moisture deficit (precipitation-potential evaporation) also significant. Significant allogenic variables correlated to the first canonical axis are not restricted to climate alone. The type of bedrock geology in the area also plays an important role in determining wetland distribution, with bogs occurring preferentially in areas of acidic bedrock, while fens are found on calcareous bedrock. The second canonical axis represents a surface-water flow gradient, with patterned fens and marshes having relatively large amounts of surface-water flow on one end and nonpermafrost bogs and swamps with low amounts of surface-water flow on the other. Texture of the subsurface is the most important variable explaining the second axis, with sediments having high hydraulic conductivity correlated to wetlands with high surface-water flow, while sediments with low hydraulic conductivity are related to wetlands with low surface-water how. Annual precipitation is also a statistically significant variable explaining the variance in wetland distribution along the second axis.

AB Aquatic invertebrates of groundwater-dependent wetlands can be sensitive to a drop in the groundwater table, which is considered one of the possible impacts of climate change. We investigated whether aquatic clitellate species are able to dwell in waterlogged substrates without surface water, in 27 spring fens studied across the Western Carpathians. A total of 78 clitellate species were recorded in pairs of samples from aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. Semi-aquatic habitats had 27 species in common with aquatic habitats, but algal and fungal feeders were less frequent and abundant, and predatory leeches and Haplotaxis gordioides completely lacking. Terrestrial enchytraeid species enriched the semi-aquatic assemblages. The main change in clitellate composition was controlled by total organic carbon. The importance of further variables, however, differed between aquatic and semi-aquatic sites. Further analyses of semi-aquatic sites showed that the distribution of primarily aquatic species was mainly driven by physical and chemical variables, while that of soil dwellers was driven by depth. Except Tubifex tubifex and Nais communis, all aquatic species preferred the uppermost layer. Results indicate that, during extreme droughts, when aquatic habitats cease to exist, some aquatic clitellates can persist in the waterlogged substrate, while some aquatic specialists may face the risk of local extinction.

AB Northern peatlands are projected to be crucial in future atmospheric methane (CH4) budgets and have a positive feedback on global warming. Fens receive nutrients from catchments via inflowing water and are more sensitive than bogs to variations in their ecohydrology. Yet, due to a lack of data detailing the impacts of moving water on microhabitats and CH4 fluxes in fens, large uncertainties remain with respect to predicting CH4 emissions from these sites under climate changes. We measured CH4 fluxes with manual chambers over three growing seasons (2017-2019) at a northern boreal fen. To address the spatial variation at the site where a stream flows through the long and narrow valley fen, we established sample plots at varying distances from the stream. To link the variations in CH4 emissions to environmental controls, we quantified water levels, peat temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, vegetation composition, and leaf area index in combination with flux measurements during the growing season in 2019. We found that due to the flowing water, there was a higher water level, cooler peat temperatures, and more oxygen in the peat close to the stream, which also had the highest total leaf area and gross primary production (GPP) values but the lowest CH4 emissions. CH4 emissions were highest at an intermediate distance from the stream where the oxygen concentration in the surface peat was low but GPP was still high. Further from the stream, the conditions were drier and produced low CH4 emissions. Our results emphasize the key role of ecohydrology in CH4 dynamics in fens and, for the first time, show how a stream controls CH4 emissions in a flow-through fen. As valley fens are common peatland ecosystems from the Arctic to the temperate zones, future projections of global CH4 budgets need to take flowing water features into account.

AB Among the most prevalent wetland and deep-water habitats in Alaska are ponds, many of which are subarctic ponds occurring as moraine, ice-scour, or dead-ice depressions. Many are closed-basin depressions, where surface-water inflows and outflows are negligible. The objective of this study was to quantify the water sources and hydrodynamics of these subarctic ponds, particularly with respect to the role they play in groundwater recharge. There are two types of ponds on the study site. Perched-precipitation ponds have inflows by melt water and direct precipitation, outflows by evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge, and are seasonally inundated because surface water is perched above the water table and infiltration through the low-permeability surficial deposits to the water table is slow. Flow-through ponds have inflows by melt water, direct precipitation, and groundwater discharge, outflows by evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge, and are perennially inundated because of groundwater throughflow. Both are groundwater recharge focal points. This is particularly true for perched-precipitation ponds, where net groundwater recharge rates were 215% larger than in flow-through ponds, and 332% larger than in the broader landscape. Most of the additional groundwater recharge occurs immediately following breakup, as aeolian-transported snow trapped in the depressions melts which results in enhanced groundwater recharge rates.

AB For the conservation and restoration of biodiverse rich fens, base-rich and nutrient-poor conditions are vital. In wetlands with artificially stable surface water levels, the re-introduction of temporary water level fluctuations has been postulated to restore the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) of fens during inundation and to reduce surface water P-input during episodes with drought. This is the first study testing this hypothesis in large-scale field manipulation experiments in rich fens with threatened rich fen mosses, rich fens with Calliergonella, and poor fens with Sphagnum. Five different experiments were conducted: 2 weeks of raised levels (+ 10 cm) in a floating and a non-floating fen during winter, 2 weeks of high levels in a non-floating fen during summer, and 2 weeks of lowered levels (-15 cm) in a floating and a non-floating fen during summer. For floating fens, both lowered and raised surface water levels in adjacent ditches did not show any effect on water tables, soil ANC or nutrient levels in fens. For non-floating fens, raised surface water levels led to inundation in all vegetation types, without affecting nutrient concentrations or vegetation. Although redox potentials decreased immediately in upper soils, ANC was generally not enhanced in winter due to limited infiltration into the waterlogged soils. In summer, in contrast, ANC increased because accelerated evapotranspiration led to enhanced infiltration of inundation water and higher temperatures resulted in microbial alkalinity generation. Short-term lowering of surface water levels in summer led to lower water tables in non-floating fens, but only when precipitation rates were low. Vegetation, ANC and nutrient concentrations were, however, not affected. The effectiveness of short-term surface water level fluctuation to restore ANC strongly depends on peat buoyancy, water saturation of soils, season and weather conditions. This explains why short-term inundation in winter is often inadequate, while short-term inundation in summer does increase ANC. Short-term droughts do not affect the ANC or nutrient availability. Our results are not only important for the hydrological management of fens, but also have implications for future management since short-term extreme weather events will occur more frequently due to climate change.

AB Temporal drying of upper soil layers of acidic methanogenic peatlands might divert the flow of reductants from CH4 formation to other electron-accepting processes due to a renewal of alternative electron acceptors. In this study, we evaluated the in situ relevance of Fe(III)-reducing microbial activities in peatlands of a forested catchment that differed in their hydrology. Intermittent seeps reduced sequentially nitrate, Fe(III), and sulfate during periods of water saturation. Due to the acidic soil conditions, released Fe(II) was transported with the groundwater flow and accumulated as Fe(III) in upper soil layers of a lowland fen apparently due to oxidation. Microbial Fe(III) reduction in the upper soil layer accounted for 26.7 and 71.6% of the anaerobic organic carbon mineralization in the intermittent seep and the lowland fen, respectively. In an upland fen not receiving exogenous Fe, Fe(III) reduction contributed only to 6.7%. Fe(II) and acetate accumulated in deeper porewater of the lowland fen with maximum concentrations of 7 and 3 mM, respectively. Both supplemental glucose and acetate stimulated the reduction of Fe(III) indicating that fermentative, incomplete, and complete oxidizers were involved in Fe(II) formation in the acidic fen. Amplification of DNA yielded PCR products specific for Acidiphilium-, Geobacter-, and Geothrix-, but not for Shewanella- or Anaeroromyxobacter- related sequences. Porewater biogeochemistry observed during a 3-year-period suggests that increased drought periods and subsequent intensive rainfalls due to global climate change will further favor Fe(III) and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors due to the storage and enhanced re-oxidation of their reduced compounds in the soil.

AB Ice-wedge polygon (IWP) peatlands in the Arctic and Subarctic are extremely vulnerable to climatic and environmental change. We present the results of a multidisciplinary paleoenvironmental study on IWPs in the northern Yukon, Canada. High-resolution laboratory analyses were carried out on a permafrost core and the overlying seasonally thawed (active) layer, from an IWP located in a drained lake basin on Herschel Island. In relation to 14 Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates spanning the last 5000 years, we report sedimentary data including grain size distribution and biogeochemical parameters (organic carbon, nitrogen, C/N ratio, delta C-13), stable water isotopes (delta O-18, delta D), as well as fossil pollen, plant macrofossil and diatom assemblages. Three sediment units (SUS) correspond to the main stages of deposition (1) in a thermokarst lake (SW : 4950 to 3950 cal yrs BP), (2) during transition from lacustrine to palustrine conditions after lake drainage (SU2: 3950 to 3120 cal yrs BP), and (3) in palustrine conditions of the IWP field that developed after drainage (SU3: 3120 cal yrs BP to 2012 CE). The lacustrine phase (pre 3950 cal yrs BP) is characterized by planktonic-benthic and pioneer diatom species indicating circumneutral waters, and very few plant macrofossils. The pollen record has captured a regional signal of relatively stable vegetation composition and climate for the lacustrine stage of the record until 3950 cal yrs BP. Palustrine conditions with benthic and acidophilic diatom species characterize the peaty shallow-water environments of the low-centered IWP. The transition from lacustrine to palustrine conditions was accompanied by acidification and rapid revegetation of the lake bottom within about 100 years. Since the palustrine phase we consider the pollen record as a local vegetation proxy dominated by the plant communities growing in the IWP. Ice-wedge cracking in water-saturated sediments started immediately after lake drainage at about 3950 cal yrs BP and led to the formation of an IWP mire. Permafrost aggradation through downward closed-system freezing of the lake talik is indicated by the stable water isotope record. The originally submerged IWP center underwent gradual drying during the past 2000 years. This study highlights the sensitivity of permafrost landscapes to climate and environmental change throughout the Holocene. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Palsa peats are unique northern ecosystems formed under an arctic climate and characterized by a high biodiversity and sensitive ecology. The stability of the palsas are seriously threatened by climate warming which will change the permafrost dynamic and induce a degradation of the mires.
   We used stable carbon isotope depth profiles in two palsa mires of Northern Sweden to track environmental change during the formation of the mires. Soils dominated by aerobic degradation can be expected to have a clear increase of carbon isotopes (delta C-13) with depth, due to preferential release of C-12 during aerobic mineralization. In soils with suppressed degradation due to anoxic conditions, stable carbon isotope depth profiles are either more or less uniform indicating no or very low degradation or depth profiles turn to lighter values due to an enrichment of recalcitrant organic substances during anaerobic mineralisation which are depleted in C-13.
   The isotope depth profile of the peat in the water saturated depressions (hollows) at the yet undisturbed mire Storflaket indicated very low to no degradation but increased rates of anaerobic degradation at the Stordalen site. The latter might be induced by degradation of the permafrost cores in the uplifted areas (hummocks) and subsequent breaking and submerging of the hummock peat into the hollows due to climate warming. Carbon isotope depth profiles of hummocks indicated a turn from aerobic mineralisation to anaerobic degradation at a peat depth between 4 and 25 cm. The age of these turning points was C-14 dated between 150 and 670 yr and could thus not be caused by anthropogenically induced climate change. We found the uplifting of the hummocks due to permafrost heave the most likely explanation for our findings. We thus concluded that differences in carbon isotope profiles of the hollows might point to the disturbance of the mires due to climate warming or due to differences in hydrology. The characteristic profiles of the hummocks are indicators for micro-geomorphic change during permafrost up heaving.

AB The formation of microrelief forms in peatlands - elevated and dry hummocks, depressed wet hollows and intermediate lawns - is controlled by the interaction of water table, nutrient availability and dominant plant communities. This affects the composition and activity of various functional groups of microorganisms. With depth, the change in peat quality from less to more highly processed organic material additionally regulates microbial activity. We hypothesized that microbial biomass and enzyme activities are driven by aeration and by peat quality and therefore (i) they increase from hollows (water saturated/anaerobic) through lawns (intermediate) to hummocks (aerobic) in the top peat and ii) they decrease with depth due to increasing distance from fresh plant-derived inputs and lower oxygen availability. These hypotheses were tested for enzymes catalysing the decomposition of C-, N-, P- and S-containing organic compounds in peat of the three microform types at three depths (15, 50 and 200 cm). Microbial biomass and peat chemical characteristics were compared with enzyme kinetic parameters, i.e. maximal potential activity (V-maa) and the Michaelis constant (K-m).
   Microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and V-maa of beta-glucosidase and N-acetyl glucosaminidase increased by 30-70% from hummocks and lawns to hollows in the top 15 cm, contradicting the hypothesis. Similarly, K-m and the catalytic efficiency of enzymes (K-a = V-max/K-m) were best related to MBC distribution and not to the aeration gradient. With depth, V-ama of beta-glucosidase, xylosidase and leucine aminopeptidase followed the hypothesized pattern in hollows. In contrast, MBC was 1.3-4 times higher at 50 cm, followed by successively lower contents at 15 and 200 cm in all microforms. The same depth pattern characterized the V-ama distribution of 6 out of 8 enzymes. Phosphatase activity decreased from drier hummock to wetter hollows and the higher activity throughout the peat profile suggested a high microbial demand for P. Enzyme activities and catalytic efficiency in peat were closely linked to the distribution of microbial biomass with depth, which in turn was best explained by P content. From the ecological perspective, these results clearly show that peat decomposition will be accelerated when microbial activity is stimulated e.g. by increased P availability.

AB Resource-access road crossings are expected to alter peatland hydrological properties by obstructing surface and sub-surface water flows. We conducted a multi-year study at two boreal peatlands - a forested bog and a shrubby rich fen near Peace River, Alberta - to study the impacts of resource access roads on the hydrology of adjacent peatland. Field measurements (bi-weekly depth to water table and hydraulic head, one-time hydraulic conductivity) during the growing seasons (May-August) of 2016 and 2017 were taken from sampling plots representing: 1) sides of the road (upstream and downstream); 2) distance from the road (obstruction); and 3) distance from culverts. Compared to the growing season average precipitation for the region of 1.8 mm d(-1), the study period had very wet conditions in 2016 (3.7 mm d(-1)) and dry conditions in 2017 (1.1 mm d(-1)).
   In contrast to our assumptions, resource access road disturbed the surface and sub-surface water flow at the bog, but the effect was minimal at the fen as the road orientation was nearly parallel to the flow direction at the latter. At the bog, the shallowest depth to water table position was observed at upstream areas closer to the road, when culverts were located > 20m distance from transects. In contrast, when culverts were present < 2m from the transects, variation in hydrological conditions between upstream and downstream areas were greatly reduced. Our work shows road effects on peatland hydrology could be minimized by aligning roads parallel to the water flow direction when possible. If water flow is perpendicular to the road, adequate spacing and installation of culverts could help to reduce flow obstruction.

AB Although northern peatlands represent a globally significant reservoir for carbon, considerable uncertainty exists concerning solute transport systems within large (>1000 km(2)) peat deposits. We therefore delineated geochemical gradients linked to groundwater recharge and discharge along a 6 km transect within the 1200 km(2) Red Lake Peatland of northwestern Minnesota. We used ratios of Ca/Mg and Sr-87/Sr-86 to distinguish discharge of calcareous groundwater (similar to 1.4 and 0.7155, respectively) to the peat land from the mineral substratum along a topographic gradient from a bog crest downslope to an internal fen water track and bog islands. In contrast, the stable isotopes of the porewaters (delta O-18 from -12.8 parts per thousand to -7.8 parts per thousand) show that the active pore-spaces in these peat profiles have been flushed by recharge from the near-surface peat. We hypothesize that back-diffusion of groundwater-derived solutes from the peat matrix to active pore-spaces has allowed the geochemical signal from paleo-hydrogeologic discharge to persist into the current regime of dilute recharge. This effect has not been observed previously on the landform-scale and has important implications for carbon cycling in peatlands. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI THE HYDROLOGICAL BALANCE OF A GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE FEN
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
ID WETLAND; RUNOFF; AREA
AB Linear regression analysis and weekly water level measurements were used to study the hydrological balance of a groundwater discharge fen. The main water flows pertain to rainfall, evapotranspiration, and groundwater discharge. Owing to the high water table in depressions, rainfall is transformed partly to direct runoff. This process depends on the landform of the study area and on the daily distribution of rainfall and evapotranspiration. During very dry summers, evaporation causes a drop in the water table. Such events may be important for plant life in the fen. Protection of the regional groundwater flow and regulation of the ditches are potential measures for hydrological management of the site.

AB Reversals in hydraulic head and extensive methane losses were identified during a drought cycle from changes in hydraulic-head and dissolved-methane profiles in peat, Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands, northern Minnesota, United States. During the summer 1990 drought, regional ground water discharged from the mineral soil underlying the peat to raised bogs. Concentrations of dissolved CH4 in pore water showed that much of the peat column was supersaturated with respect to a reference standard of 1 atm partial pressure CH4. By the summer of 1991, the severity of the drought lessened, and the upper peat column was resaturated with precipitation-derived water. Ground-water flow was then controlled by local, precipitation-driven, recharge flow systems, and the regional ground water that was discharged affected only the peat immediately above the mineral soil-peat interface. In contrast, during the summer of 1991, concentrations of dissolved CH4 in pore water were all undersaturated with respect to 1 atm partial pressure CH4. The decrease in the amount of dissolved CH4 in the pore water from the summer of 1990 to the summer of 1991 probably was caused by changes in the CH4 flux and degassing to the unsaturated zone and to a lesser extent by changes in the partial pressure of gaseous CH4 in the peat as the peat volume increased with expansion as it resaturated.

AB We studied the response of methane production and oxidation potentials in a minerotrophic and an ombrotrophic mire to water table fluctuations. In profiles where water table had not varied, the water-saturated layers showed significant potentials while the unsaturated layers did not. The production potentials in the saturated layers below water level ranged from 0.1 to 2.4 mu g CH4 h(-1) (g d.w.)(-1) and oxidation potentials (first order reaction rate constants) between -0.010 and -0.120 h(-1) (g d.w.)(-1). In profiles with constant water level, the maximal production potential occurred 20 cm and maximal oxidation potential 10 cm below water level. When water table varied only a little, production potentials slightly increased towards the autumn. After a water level draw-down, in the profiles from the dry microsites, production and oxidation potentials were detected in layers that had been unsaturated up to 6 weeks. The maximal oxidation zone was shifted downwards during low water periods. In a wet microsite, a 2 week period of unsaturation eliminated the production potentials and decreased the oxidation potentials. After a rise in the water level, the potentials were reactivated more rapidly in the wet than in the dry microsites. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB When soils are water saturated, the reduced forms of soil nitrogen such as ammonium are favored. Under anaerobiosis, ammonium production has been explained by several mechanisms such as organic nitrogen mineralization (ONM), dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) and the release of adsorbed ammonium during microbial reduction of iron oxides (MRFeO). Nevertheless, in anaerobic soils the dominance of one mechanism over the others is still debated. Nitrogen appears to influence the reproductive dynamics of Mauritia flexuosa, the dominant canopy species of the "morichal" ecosystem. Even though M. flexuosa has been classified as "vulnerable", ammonium production in morichal soils is not well understood. Considering this, we evaluated in a morichal soil from SE Venezuela, the mechanisms associated with ammonium production under anaerobic conditions. To this end, we designed an anaerobic incubation experiment to follow over time the concentrations of nitrate, extractable ferrous iron and ammonium together with the activity of beta-glucosaminidase as an index of N mineralization. To account for the relative importance of ONM, DNRA and MRFeO on ammonium production, we used multiple linear regression models. The results showed that the three mechanisms are involved in ammonium production. However, ONM is the main source of ammonium in the initial 15 days of soil incubation, while MRFeO explains ammonium produced after 15 days of soil incubation. However, under climate change scenarios these mechanisms may be altered, thereby increasing the N limitation of morichales and consequently its vulnerability. Since morichales are threatened ecosystems, that play a key ecological, economic and cultural role, studies on the soil nitrogen dynamics are important to design and evaluate effective management, conservation and protection strategies. This study can be a relevant contribution in this area.

AB Areas of groundwater-surface water interaction in riverbanks and open mires are important habitats for groundwater-dependent species. In order to preserve these ecosystems, the planning and development of mining operations on such locations require a fundamental understanding of the groundwater discharge-recharge and flow patterns. In this study. 3D flow modelling and a TIR survey were used to define the groundwater discharge. Simultaneously, the flow modelling and groundwater table fluctuation were used for defining groundwater recharge at a mining development site in northern Finland. The results indicated flow towards the River Kitinen and the discharge of groundwater in the banks of the river. The discharge also occurred within the mire area, which may provide suitable habitats for groundwater-dependent plant species. The modelling results and stable isotope variations indicated complex flow patterns and a potential groundwater connection from the Viiankiaapa mire through possible bedrock fractures to the river. Recharge mainly occurred in the sorted sediment accumulations of the riverbanks and partly also in the mire area.

AB Recently in humid tropical Asia, human activities have begun to extend toward the coastal lowland areas where widespread peat swamps are distributed. Draining peat swamp areas for agricultural uses creates a high risk of sulfuric acidification. The research site in this paper was a strand plain comprising beach ridges, swales on inter-ridges, and peaty backswamps in southeast Thailand. Thus, the actual and potential acid sulfate soil in the peaty backswamps is a major problem there, but sandy podzols on older beach ridges are also considered an agricultural problem soil. To establish an agricultural landscape plan encompassing the whole of the strand plain, we studied the land characteristics associated with the landforms and soils, their spatial variability related to landscape evolution, and the status of present plant resources in terms of biomass and species diversity for local farmers on peaty backswamps and beach ridges. We found that all spatial attributes of the two soils, such as the locations, profiles, and chemical and physical properties, were closely related to the geomorphic formation process or chronosequence: the landward or older backswamp has ripe clay and the seaward or younger one partly has unripe clay; the degree of spodic horizon development with ortstein is highest in the most landward beach-ridge system and decreases seaward; and the profile positions of the spodic horizons were related to the fluctuations of marine sand sediments, as revealed in a fine-scale survey. Finding these spatial regularities is useful for predicting land characteristics in areas outside of detailed research sites, reducing time and cost as well as forming the basis of landscape planning. Plant resources presently utilized by local farmers on the strand plain are Melaleuca cajuputi forests on both the peaty backswamps and the beach ridges, and home gardens of tropical fruit trees around settlements. Ecological carrying capacity in terms of biomass of M. cajuputi was not significantly different among soil types in the strand plain, but the growth rate and potential biomass of the species appears to be highest in thick, water-saturated peaty backswamps with acid sulfate soils. By comparing the species composition of home gardens in different areas, we found that oil the beach ridges, although the ecological carrying capacity in terms of biomass for several types of fruit trees appears lower, a great number of species particular to the shrub layer are maintained. Based on the spatial variability of land characteristics and the ecological carrying capacity in terms of biomass, we identified separate land units and suggested future land-management and land-use systems appropriate to each unit.

AB Liparis loeselii (L.) Rich. is an endangered orchid species which occurs in wetland habitats. For successful conservation of this orchid it is necessary to recognize its adaptive traits and special habitat requirements. Therefore, we examined morphological and anatomical traits in relation to the water level, cover of vascular plants and seed viability of L. loeselii in habitats with different water level fluctuations. Field studies of L. loeselii were carried out in nine localities and four habitat types: alkaline fen, calcareous fen with Cladium mariscus, transition mire and quaking bog. The fluctuations of seasonal water level were defined in the range from dry substrate to short time flooding (up to two weeks). Leaf length and width of 30 flowering specimens of L. loeselii as well as angle between the leaf blade and the axis of the inflorescence were measured at each locality. Seed viability and root anatomy were examined in the laboratory. 'the leaf angle was significantly affected (P < 0.05) by water level in the studied habitat. The leaf length to width ratio in each population of L. loeselii did not show significant differences between the years, but was characteristic for the habitat type. L. loeselii sensitivity to the long-term flooding in the habitat is associated with a lack of aerenchyma in its roots. During shortterm flooding specimens of L. loeselii can survive due to a shallow root system and hyponastic leaf movements. As evidenced by seed viability, the most favourable growth conditions for L. loeselii are in the habitats with partially water saturated substrate with balanced water supply.

AB Ground-water flow simulations were constructed to evaluate the interaction between ground water and wetlands systems, focusing on peatlands in the Kenai Peninsula Lowlands, south-central Alaska. Peatland systems occur in both recharge and discharge zones along transects simulated in computer models, whereas toe slope wetlands occurred in discharge zones. Sensitivity analysis indicates that hydraulic conductance of subsurface units has a strong influence on the rates and directions of ground-water flow exchanged between peatland systems and the surrounding mineral sediments, and needs to be further characterized to assess the hydrologic function of wetlands in the Kenai Lowlands. Perching of the water table was simulated in several modeling scenarios, altering ground-water flux rates to wetlands and shifting recharge zones to topographically lower areas. Runoff (saturated surface flow and shallow interflow) was the dominant flux in all simulations. Our exploratory simulations suggest three avenues for future research using computer modeling to evaluate wetland hydrologic function in the Kenai Peninsula: 1) improved simulation methods to better characterize ground-water perching and overland flow, 2) better characterization of the distribution and hydrogeologic parameters of geologic units, and 3) collection of hydraulic head data in and near representative wetland systems to calibrate computer simulations.

AB With respect to their role in the global carbon cycle, natural peatlands are characterized by their ability to sequester atmospheric carbon. This trait is strongly connected to the water regime of these ecosystems. Large parts of the soil profile in natural peatlands are water saturated, leading to anoxic conditions and to a diminished decomposition of plant litter. In functioning peatlands, the rate of carbon fixation by plant photosynthesis is larger than the decomposition rate of dead organic material. Over time, the amount of carbon that remains in the soil and is not converted back to carbon dioxide grows. Land use of peatlands often goes along with water level manipulations and thereby with alterations of carbon flux dynamics. In this study, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) flux measurements from a bog site in northwestern Germany that has been heavily degraded by peat mining are presented. Two contrasting types of management have been implemented at the site: (1) drainage during ongoing peat harvesting on one half of the central bog area and (2) rewetting on the other half that had been taken out of use shortly before measurements commenced. The presented 2-year data set was collected with an eddy covariance (EC) system set up on a central railroad dam that divides the two halves of the (former) peat harvesting area. We used footprint analysis to split the obtained CO2 and CH4 flux time series into data characterizing the gas exchange dynamics of both contrasting land use types individually. The time series gaps resulting from data division were filled using the response of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to environmental variables, footprint variability, and fuzzy transformations of seasonal and diurnal cyclicity. We used the gap-filled gas flux time series from 2 consecutive years to evaluate the impact of rewetting on the annual vertical carbon balances of the cutover bog. Rewetting had a considerable effect on the annual carbon fluxes and led to increased CH4 and decreased CO2 release.
   The larger relative difference between cumulative CO2 fluxes from the rewetted (13 +/- 6 mol m(-2) a(-1)) and drained (22 +/- 7 mol m(-2) a(-1)) section occurred in the second observed year when rewetting apparently reduced CO2 emissions by 40 %. The absolute difference in annual CH4 flux sums was more similar between both years, while the relative difference of CH4 release between the rewetted (0.83 +/- 0.15 mol m(-2) a(-1)) and drained (0.45 +/- 0.11 mol m(-2) a(-1)) section was larger in the first observed year, indicating a maximum increase in annual CH4 release of 84% caused by rewetting at this particular site during the study period.

AB A comparative analysis on source rock properties has been carried out on the Miocene-Pliocene formations as well as the Quaternary terrace deposits using Rock-Eval pyrolysis results and organic petrography as well as some biomarkers results. Samples were obtained from outcrops of the Quaternary terrace deposits, Pliocene-aged Liang Formation together with the Miocene Miri and Setap Shale formations in Brunei-Muara district, with sample lithologies ranging from coal, coaly shale, shale and lignitic sand. High total organic carbon (TOC) and S-2 values ranging from 41.8 to 62.4% and 7.40 mg HC/g rock to 122 mg HC/g rock, respectively, are identified in coals of the terrace deposit, Liang and Miri formations, making these as the best potential source rock due to the "good to excellent" generating potential. Meanwhile, a "fair to poor" potential is exhibited for the coaly shale, shale and lignitic sand samples as a result of their low TOC, HI and S-2 values. The organic matter is composed of kerogen type III (gas prone) and type II-III (mixed oil and gas prone). Organic matter in all studied formations originate from a terrestrial-source, as proven by the abundance of huminite. Organic petrographical and biomarkers studies suggest that the coals and lignitic sand samples were deposited in a mangrove-type mire in a lower delta setting, under oxic and limnic to limnotelmatic conditions, except sample DD2-1, which is deposited in a less water-saturated environment. The samples display the presence of bi-modal and normal distribution of n-alkanes. For all of the samples, the dominating plant types in the palaeomire are of soft, herbaceous plants and this is supported by the low vegetation index and moderate P-aq values. All the studied samples are thermally immature to early mature, as exhibited by the T-max values that range from 300 to 437 degrees C and vitrinite reflectance readings of 0.22% to 0.46%.

AB Globally, peat lands are considered to be a sink of CO2, but a source when drained. Additionally, wet peat lands are thought to emit considerable amounts of CH4 and N2O. Hitherto, reliable and integrated estimates of emissions and emission factors for this type of land cover have been lacking and the effects of wetland restoration on methane emissions have been poorly quantified. In this paper we estimate the full greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of a restored natural peat land by determining the fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O through atmosphere and water, while accounting for the different Global Warming Potentials (GWP's).
   The site is an abandoned agricultural peat meadow, which has been converted into a wetland nature reserve ten years ago, after which the water level was raised. GHG fluxes were measured continuously with an eddy covariance system (CO2) and flux chamber measurements (CH4 and N2O). Meteorological and hydrological measurements were collected as well. With growing seasons of respectively 192, 168 and 129 days, the annual net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was -446+ +/- 83 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2004, -311 +/- 58 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2005 and -232 +/- 57 g m(-2) yr(-1) for 2006. Ecosystem respiration (Reco) was estimated as 869 +/- 668 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2004, 866 +/- 666 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2005 and 924 +/- 711 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2006. CH4 emissions from the saturated land and water surfaces were high compared to the relatively dry land. Annual weighted CH4 emissions were 31.27 +/- 20.40 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2005 and 32.27 +/- 21.08 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2006. N2O fluxes were too low to be of significance. The water balance of the area was dominated by precipitation and evapotranspiration and therefore fluxes of carbon and CH4 through seepage, infiltration and drainage were relatively small (17.25 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The carbon- balance consisted for the largest part of CO2 uptake, CO2 respiration and CH4 emission from water saturated land and water. CO2 emission has decreased significantly as result of the raised water table, while CH4 fluxes have increased. In GWP's the area was a small net GHG sink given as CO2- equiv. of - 86 g m(-2) yr(-1) (over a 100-year period).

AB Peatlands are significant global methane (CH4) sources, but processes governing CH4 dynamics have been predominantly studied in the Northern Hemisphere. Southern hemispheric and tropical bogs can be dominated by cushion-forming vascular plants (e.g. Astelia pumila, Donatia fascicularis). These cushion bogs are found in many (mostly southern) parts of the world but could also serve as extreme examples for densely rooted northern hemispheric bogs dominated by rushes and sedges. We report highly variable summer CH4 emissions from different microforms in a Patagonian cushion bog as determined by chamber measurements. Driving biogeochemical processes were identified from pore water profiles and carbon isotopic signatures. Intensive root activity throughout a rhizosphere stretching over 2m in depth accompanied by molecular oxygen release created aerobic microsites in water-saturated peat, leading to a thorough CH4 oxidation (<0.003 mmol L-1 pore water CH4, enriched in delta C-13-CH4 by up to 10 %) and negligible emissions (0.09 +/- 0.16 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) from Astelia lawns. In sparsely or even non-rooted peat below adjacent pools pore water profile patterns similar to those obtained under Astelia lawns, which emitted very small amounts of CH4 (0.23 +/- 0.25 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), were found. Below the A. pumila rhizosphere pore water concentrations increased sharply to 0.40 +/- 0.25 mmol CH4 L-1 and CH4 was predominantly produced by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. A few Sphagnum lawns and - surprisingly - one lawn dominated by cushion-forming D. fascicularis were found to be local CH4 emission hotspots with up to 1.52 +/- 1.10 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1) presumably as root density and molecular oxygen release dropped below a certain threshold. The spatial distribution of root characteristics supposedly causing such a pronounced CH4 emission pattern was evaluated on a conceptual level aiming to exemplify scenarios in densely rooted bogs. We conclude that presence of cushion vegetation as a proxy for negligible CH4 emissions from cushion bogs needs to be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, overall ecosystem CH4 emissions at our study site were probably minute compared to bog ecosystems worldwide and widely decoupled from environmental controls due to intensive root activity of A. pumila, for example.

AB Predicted climate changings can affect hemi-boreal forests especially for soil conditions with low water-holding capacity and susceptibility to soil water deficits. In our study, species-specific sap flux, transpiration and water use efficiency of growth (WUE) were investigated at a mixed hemi-boreal forest ecosystems, especially during temporary moderate dry periods in the main growing season. Therefore, two representative forest sites with different drought susceptibility were selected in Northwest-Lithuania. The aim of our investigations was to identify the responsible factors influencing transpiration and WUE from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies L. H. Karst.) and birch (silver birch: Betula pendula Roth. and downy birch: B. pubescens Ehrh.) during temporary drought incidents at a water-limited, oligitrophic sand dominated forest site and at a water saturated, mesoeutrophic organic peat forest site for the whole vegetation period and two moderate short-term drought incidents in 2016. During the dry periods Norway spruce trees exhibited lowest sap flux compared to Scot pine and birch while similarly showing highest WUE. Up-scaled to a virtual pure stand none of the species were differing in species specific transpiration. Thus, we found no evidence for extended drought sensitivity of Norway spruce at the water limited site during the first investigation year. Sap flux of Scots pine trees was more or less constantly high during the main growing season and the dry periods at both plots, while WUE was quite low during the "dry periods". Thus, we assume that Scots pine trees are less affected by temporarily drought events than Norway spruce. Birch trees exhibited significantly highest sap flux during dry periods at the water limited site whereas quite low WUE was not differing between sites. Thus, birch may compete with Scots pine trees at the study sites in terms of water consumption and growth in future.

AB We investigated rates and controls on greenhouse gas (CO(2)and CH4) production in two contrasting water-saturated tundra soils within a permafrost-affected watershed near Nome, Alaska, United States. Three years of field sample analysis have shown that soil from a fen-like area in the toeslope of the watershed had higher pH and higher porewater ion concentrations than soil collected from a bog-like peat plateau at the top of the hillslope. The influence of these contrasting geochemical and topographic environments on CO(2)and CH(4)production was tested in soil microcosms by incubating both the organic- and mineral-layer soils anaerobically for 55 days. Nitrogen (as NH4Cl) was added to half of the microcosms to test potential effects of N limitation on microbial greenhouse gas production. We found that the organic toeslope soils produced more CO(2)and CH4, fueled by higher pH and higher concentrations of water-extractable organic C (WEOC). Our results also indicate N limitation on CO(2)production in the peat plateau soils but not the toeslope soils. Together these results suggest that the weathering and leaching of ions and nutrients from tundra hillslopes can increase the rate of anaerobic soil organic matter decomposition in downslope soils by (1) increasing the pH of soil porewater; (2) providing bioavailable WEOC and fermentation products such as acetate; and (3) relieving microbial N limitation through nutrient runoff. We conclude that the soil geochemistry as mediated by landscape position is an important factor influencing the rate and magnitude of greenhouse gas production in tundra soils.

AB Radium activity in pore water of wetland sediments often differs from the amount expected from local production, decay, and exchange with solid phases. This disequilibrium results from vertical transport of radium with groundwater that flows between the underlying aquifer and surface water. In situations where groundwater recharge or discharge is significant, the rate of vertical water flow through wetland sediment can be determined from the radium disequilibrium by a combined model of transport, production, decay, and exchange with solid phases. We have developed and tested this technique at three sites in the freshwater portion of the Everglades by quantifying vertical advective velocities in areas with persistent groundwater recharge or discharge and estimating a coefficient of dispersion at a site that is subject to reversals between recharge and discharge. Groundwater velocities (v) were determined to be between 0 and -0.5 cm d(-1) for a recharge site and 1.5 +/- 0.4 cm d(-1) for a discharge site near Levee 39 in the Everglades. Strong gradients in Ra-223 and Ra-224 usually occurred at the base of the peat layer, which avoided the problems of other tracers (e.g., chloride) for which greatest sensitivity occurs near the peat surface-a zone readily disturbed by processes unrelated to groundwater flow. This technique should be easily applicable to any wetland system with different production rates of these isotopes in distinct sedimentary layers or surface water. The approach is most straightforward in systems where constant pore-water ionic strength can be assumed, simplifying the modeling of radium exchange.

AB The major environmental gradients underlying plant species distribution were outlined in two climatically and bio-geographically contrasting mires: a Swedish bog in the boreo-nemoral zone, and an Italian bog in the south-eastern Alps. Data on mire morphology, surface hydrology, floristic composition, peat chemistry and pore-water chemistry were collected along transects from the mire margin (i.e., the outer portion of the mire in contact with the surrounding mineral soil) towards the mire expanse (i.e., the inner portion of the mire). The delimitation and the extent of the minerotrophic mire margin were related to the steepness of the lateral mire slope which, in turns, controls the direction of surface water flow. The mineral soil water limit was mirrored in geochemical variables such as pH, alkalinity, Ca2+, Mg2+, Al3+, Mn2+, and SiO2 concentrations in pore-water, as well as Ca, Al, Fe, N and P contents in surface peat. Depending on regional requirements of plant species, different species were useful as fen limit indicators at the two sites. The main environmental factors affecting distribution of habitat types and plant species in the two mires were the acidity-alkalinity gradient, and the gradient in depth to the water table. The mire margin - mire expanse gradient corresponds to a complex gradient mainly reflected in a differentiation of vegetation structure in relation to the aeration of the peat substrate.

AB To study the relationship between mire vegetation and ecological variables we tested the Finnish hypothesis that the mire margin to expanse gradient in vegetation composition relates to a gradient of solutes (main plant nutrients) in the soil that is separate from the mainly pH related poor-rich gradient. Successional mire basins where mire margin to expanse is the prominent gradient were surveyed. An indirect method (Ellenberg indicator values) and direct measurements (phosphorous concentrations, pH) were used to assess the relationship between the mire margin to expanse and nutrients gradients. Vegetation with indicators of Subtype A mire margin vegetation (assumed to reflect surface water flow) correlated best with Ellenberg nitrogen values, whereas Subtype B (assumed to reflect groundwater influence) correlated best with Ellenberg reaction values. Subtype C (supposed to reflect mineral soil influence) did not correlate with these Ellenberg values. The study provides information about the complexity of the vegetational gradients. In general, water flow seems to be related to the poor-rich gradient, but surface water flow is also related to the nutrients gradient. Subtype C (influence of mineral soil) seems to differ from the other two subtypes of the mire margin to expanse gradient and also from the poor-rich gradient. It is prominent on forested sites, where the water table is comparatively deep.

AB Piezometric head data from various depths were examined at two peatlands in Ontario, Canada and one peatland in Sweden influenced by small-scale, shallow groundwater systems. Data from different hydrogeological settings show reversals in groundwater flow leading to discharge in topographically high regions of peatlands in isolation from large-scale groundwater flow. It is suggested that subsurface flow within peat can reverse in direction in response to water deficit and water-table drawdown. The data presented here refute the assumption that local groundwater flow in peatlands is unidirectional and further illustrate the fact that measurable subsurface water flow can occur at depth in peat isolated from large-scale groundwater flow systems. In the light of implicit assumptions made by many workers on water movement in peatlands, especially when connected to small-scale groundwater systems, the consequences of such reversals are paramount in understanding the hydrology and biogeochemistry of peatlands.

AB We used a case study (Hirvisuo mire complex, southern aapa mire zone, Finland) to describe a new morphological classification for aapa mires and used as a basis the broad, vegetation-based ecological aapa-mire concept. It deviates from the narrow morphological aapa-mire concept referring solely to patterned fens. Three scales (micro, meso and macro) were applied for the morphology. The important meso scale included eight different units. Units were delineated on aerial photographs. Macro scale included the whole complex and its bisection to central and peripheral aapa-mire areas according to the horizontal water flow pattern within the whole complex. Stability of water regime was mainly inferred from vegetation on the basis of previous literature about the ecology of mire site types and other vegetation units described in Finland and Sweden. Groundwater recharge-discharge pattern was also mainly inferred from mire vegetation supported by previous, sporadic groundwater level measurements in the mineral soil formation south of the study area. For the importance of understanding the whole geo-hydro-ecologic system as a unit, the landscape level is stressed.

AB Methanogenesis was studied in water-saturated pear cores from hollows in Ellergower Moss, New Galloway, Scotland. The concentration of CH4, increased with depth from 0.8 mu M at the surface to reach a plateau of 500 mu M at 14 cm; at this depth CO2 concentrations often reached 10 fold those of CH4. O-2 decreased from near air saturation to less than 10 nM at 6 cm depth. Argon transport from the top of the core downwards occurred more rapidly (D = 0.8-7 x 10(-8) m(2) s(-1), dependent on depth) than could be accounted for by simple diffusion through the peat. Vascular plants (Molinia, Eriophorum and Carex) had well-developed roots and were adapted to water-logged conditions in that they possessed extensive aerenchymatous lacunae throughout their roots, shoots and leaves. As well as facilitating O-2 diffusion downwards to submerged tissues,this system enables rapid diffusion upwards of CH4. This process of gaseous transport in vascular plants is subject to control by stomata. Emission rates of CO2 and CH4 thus show diurnal rhythms at constant temperature. Free-run of CO2 oscillation in the dark at 15 cm depth indicates circadian clock control. The temperature sensitivity of CH4 emission is remarkably high Q(10) = 3.0 between 10 and 20 degrees C in the dark); in cores kept under natural conditions of temperature and daylight the daily rhythms entrain to the peat temperature cycles.

AB Terrestrial microcosms (TMCs) are frequently used for testing the durability of wood and wood-based materials, as well as the protective effectiveness of wood preservatives. In contrary to experiments in soil ecology sciences, the experimental setup is usually rather simple. However, for service life prediction of wood exposed in ground, it is of imminent interest to better understand the different parameters defining the boundary conditions in TMCs. This study focused, therefore, on soil-wood-moisture interactions. Terrestrial microcosms were prepared from the same compost substrate with varying water holding capacities (WHCs) and soil moisture contents (MCsoil). Wood specimens were exposed to 48 TMCs with varying WHCs and MCsoil. The wood moisture content (MCwood) was studied as well as its distribution within the specimens. For this purpose, the compost substrate was mixed with sand and peat and its WHC was determined using two methods in comparison, i.e., the droplet counting method and the cylinder sand bath method in which the latter turned out advantageous over the other. The MCwood increased generally with rising MCsoil, but WHC was often negatively correlated with MCwood. The distance to water saturation S-soil from which MCwood increased most intensively was found to be wood-species specific and might, therefore, require further consideration in soil-bed durability-testing and service life modelling of wood in soil contact.

AB Properties of Fe oxides are poorly understood in soils with fluctuating water tables and variable redox conditions. The objective of this research was to (a) characterize the mineralogical composition of Fe oxides and (b) determine the relationship to the stable Fe isotope ratio in a soil with temporally and spatially sharp redox gradients.
   The lowland Gleysol (Petrogleyic) is in Northwest Germany and consists of oximorphic soil horizons (Ah 0-15, Bg 15-35, and CrBg 35-70 cm) developed from Holocene fluvial loam overlaying glaciofluvial sand with reductomorphic properties (2Cr horizon, +70 cm). Field measurements during the course of 28 months included the monitoring of groundwater table, soil redox potential, and analysis of the soil solutions. Solid Fe phases were studied by room temperature and cryogenic (57)Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy, and stable Fe isotope compositions by multiple collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.
   The groundwater table ranged from -83 cm below to +8 cm above soil surface (median -27 cm). Permanent reducing conditions occurred in the 2Cr horizon with dissolved Fe concentrations of 44.8 mg L(-1) (median). The duration of oxidizing conditions increased in the order CrBg < Bg < Ah. Total Fe increased from 50 (Ah) over 316 (Bg) up to 412 g kg(-1) (CrBg) and was lowest in the 2Cr horizon (7 g kg(-1)). Ferrihydrite (51% of total Fe) was dominant over goethite (24%) in the Ah horizon. Conversely, nanogoethite dominated both the Bg (94%) and CrBg (86%) horizons. Iron in siderite amounted to 7% in the CrBg horizon. Iron isotope compositions yielded a range of delta (57)Fe values from +0.29aEuro degrees (Ah horizon) to -0.30aEuro degrees (Bg horizon). In contrast to the overlying CrBg (delta (57)Fe = -0.19aEuro degrees) and Bg horizons, the 2Cr horizon is characterized by a relatively high delta (57)Fe value of +0.22aEuro degrees.
   Lasting water saturation and frequent reducing conditions lead to the enrichment of goethite in subsoil. Once formed, goethite remains stable compared to ferrihydrite because it is less available for microbial mediated reductive dissolution. High delta (57)Fe values in the topsoil primary result from fast ferrihydrite precipitation during aeration immediately after reducing conditions. In contrast, the low delta (57)Fe values of the Fe-rich horizons (Bg, CrBg) promote adsorption of dissolved Fe with a light isotope composition onto goethite during capillary rise. The high delta (57)Fe value of the Fe-poor subsoil (2Cr) is related to silicate-bound Fe rather than dissolution and precipitation of Fe oxides.

AB Within peatland ecosystems, small deviations in surface elevation result in microforms that differ in depth to water table, plant type and rate of biogeochemical cycling, possibly leading to differences in peat physical and hydrological properties that could feed back to the whole ecosystem hydrological and biogeochemical function. However, hydrological parameters for peatland microforms have not been quantified. This study determined bulk density, pore size distribution and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) at hummocks and hollows of four, Sphagnum-dominated Canadian peatlands. Study sites included both a bog and poor fen in each of Alberta and Quebec allowing for investigation of differences in peat hydrophysical properties between microforms across a range of Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. Hydraulic conductivity was determined in the laboratory on peat from the surface (0.03-0.08 m) and the saturated zone (0.20 m below the local water table position). Peatland type, climate region, microform and depth of peat were all significant descriptors of variation in K-sat. Deeper peat was less conductive than surface peat. Hummocks generally had higher K-sat than hollows at both surface and saturated zones, although differences between microforms varied between sites. Differences in K-sat between samples were correlated with bulk density, von Post humification and macroporosity. These results indicate that there are microtopographical differences in peat hydrophysical properties; however, the strong decline in K-sat with depth indicates that differences in the local water table, resulting in a change in depth of water flow, is likely a stronger control on local K-sat than microform type.

AB Knowledge of the anthropogenic impact on the hydrology of low-productive fens that are subject to environmental degradation is essential to improve currently utilized hydrological fen restoration strategies. We analyse the naturally and anthropogenically driven evolution of groundwater systems in an intensively managed fen area in The Netherlands using a series of three-dimensional palaeo-groundwater models at a high spatial and temporal resolution. These palaeo-models are representative for five time slices of the time frame 0-2000 AD (Anno Domini), which are defined according to the timing of the natural and anthropogenic developments that had major impacts on the groundwater system configuration. For each time slice, palaeo-geohydrological conditions are reconstructed, which allowed for the calculation of groundwater discharge patterns, water balances and groundwater flow patterns.
   Contrary to former studies on the evolution of groundwater systems, our palaeo-hydrological reconstruction indicates that current groundwater discharge flux into managed fens may exceed the late-natural groundwater discharge flux. The increased groundwater discharge flux relates to the development of groundwater systems in the river valley with the establishment of polders since 1350 AD. Notably, more recent redirections of groundwater flow due to the reclamation of lakes and the establishment of abstractions wells, as well as the decreased groundwater recharge by anthropogenic land cover change, reduced the groundwater discharge flux only to a minor extent. This finding opposes the hypothesis that a decreased groundwater flux to fens underlies the environmental degradation of fens in intensively managed regions. The palaeo-hydrological reconstruction provides evidence that it is mainly the changes in the spatial configuration, and the shift in the predominant groundwater discharge mechanism, that underlies the environmental degradation of managed low-productive fens. We discuss the consequences of these hydrological changes for the suitability and availability of fen habitat sites. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The abundance, activity, and temperature response of aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria were studied in permafrost-affected tundra soils of northeast Siberia. The soils were characterized by both a high accumulation of organic matter at the surface and high methane concentrations in the water-saturated soils. The methane oxidation rates of up to 835 nmol CH4 h(-1) g(-1) in the surface soils were similar to the highest values reported so far for natural wetland soils worldwide. The temperature response of methane oxidation was measured during short incubations and revealed maximum rates between 22 degrees C and 28 degrees C. The active methanotrophic community was characterized by its phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) concentrations and with stable isotope probing (SIP). Concentrations of 16:1 omega 8 and 18:1 omega 8 PLFAs, specific to methanotrophic bacteria, correlated significantly with the potential methane oxidation rates. In all soils, distinct 16:1 PLFAs were dominant, indicating a predominance of type I methanotrophs. However, long-term incubation of soil samples at 0 degrees C and 22 degrees C demonstrated a shift in the composition of the active community with rising temperatures. At 0 degrees C, only the concentrations of 16:1 PLFAs increased and those of 18:1 PLFAs decreased, whereas the opposite was true at 22 degrees C. Similarly, SIP with (CH4)-C-13 showed a temperature-dependent pattern. When the soils were incubated at 0 degrees C, most of the incorporated label (83%) was found in 16:1 PLFAs and only 2% in 18:1 PLFAs. In soils incubated at 22 degrees C, almost equal amounts of C-13 label were incorporated into 16:1 PLFAs and 18:1 PLFAs (33% and 36%, respectively). We concluded that the highly active methane-oxidizing community in cold permafrost-affected soils was dominated by type I methanotrophs under in situ conditions. However, rising temperatures, as predicted for the future, seem to increase the importance of type II methanotrophs, which may affect methane cycling in northern wetlands. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

ID COTTONWOOD LAKE AREA; GROUND-WATER; NORTH-DAKOTA; SANDHILLS; NEBRASKA
AB Results of long-term field studies of wetlands in four different hydrogeologic and climatic settings in the United States indicate that each has considerably different sources of water, which affects their response to climate variability and land-use practices. A fen wetland in New Hampshire is supplied almost entirely by ground water that originates as seepage from Mirror Lake; therefore, stream discharge from the fen closely follows the pattern of Mirror Lake stage fluctuations. A fen wetland in northern Minnesota is supplied largely by discharge from a regional ground-water flow system that has its recharge area 1 to 2 kin to the east. Because of the size of this wetland's ground-water watershed, stream discharge from the fen has little variability. A prairie-pothole wetland in North Dakota receives more than 90 percent of its water from precipitation and loses more than 90 percent of its water to evapotranspiration, resulting in highly variable seasonal and annual water levels. A wetland in the sandhills of Nebraska lies in a regional ground-water flow field that extends for tens of kilometers and that contains numerous lakes and wetlands. The wetland receives water that moves through the ground-water system from the upgradient lakes and from ground water in local flow systems that are recharged between the lakes. The difference in sources of water to these wetlands implies that they would require different techniques to protect their water supply and water quality.

AB Nitrous oxide is an important greenhouse gas and its origin and fate are thus of broad interest. Most studies on emissions of nitrous oxide from soils focused on fluxes between soil and atmosphere and hence represent an integration of physical and biological processes at different depths of a soil profile. Analysis of N2O concentration and isotope signature along soil profiles was suggested to improve the localisation of sources and sinks in soils as well as underlying processes and could therefore extend our knowledge on processes affecting surface N2O fluxes. Such a mechanistic understanding would be desirable to improve N2O mitigation strategies and global N2O budgets. To investigate N2O dynamics within soil profiles of two contrasting (semi)natural ecosystem types (a temperate acidic fen and a Norway spruce forest), soil gas samplers were constructed to meet the different requirements of a water-saturated and an unsaturated soil, respectively. The samplers were installed in three replicates and allowed soil gas sampling from six different soil depths. We analysed soil air for N2O concentration and isotope composition and calculated N2O net turnover using a mass balance approach and considering diffusive fluxes. At the fen site, N2O was mainly produced in 30-50cm soil depth. Diffusion to adjacent layers above and below indicated N2O consumption. Values of 15N and 18O of N2O in the fen soil were always linearly correlated and their qualitative changes within the profile corresponded with the calculated turnover processes, suggesting further reduction of N2O. In the spruce forest, highest N2O production occurred in the topsoil, but there was also notable production occurring in the subsoil at a depth of 70cm. Changes in N2O isotope composition as to be expected from local production and consumption processes within the soil profile did hardly occur, though. This was presumably caused by high diffusive fluxes and comparatively low net turnover, as isotope signatures approached values measured for ambient N2O towards the topsoil. Our results demonstrate a highly variable influence of diffusive versus production/consumption processes on N2O concentration and isotope composition, depending on the type of ecosystem. This finding indicates the necessity of further N2O concentration and isotope profile investigations in different types of natural and anthropogenic ecosystems in order to generalise our mechanistic understanding of N2O exchange between soil and atmosphere.

AB Numerical simulations indicate that mechanical dispersive mixing can be the dominant mass transport mechanism in large peatlands. Dispersive mixing driven by lateral flow can drive solute fluxes from the mineral soil upward to the peat surface and thereby explain observed patterns of bug and fen in large peatlands. Longitudinal and transverse dispersivities of only 0.5 and 0.05 m, respectively, were sufficient to supply solutes to the peat surface in the absence of upward ground-water flow. Incorporation of hydrodynamic dispersion in peatland systems explains apparent contradictions in solute migration in peatlands, allowing the simultaneous downward flux of labile carbon (i.e. root exudates) produced at the peat surface and upward migration of inorganic solutes from the underlying mineral soil. Previous models of peatland hydrogeochemistry that rely on advection alone as the dominant process for solute transport may therefore be inadequate to explain fully the hydrology, geochemistry, and evolution of large peatlands.

AB When considering water protection, the spatial distribution of catchment properties is relevant, since the areas adjoining the water body contribute more to water quality than the remote areas near the water divide. This study presents an approach to describe catchments spatially; two-dimensional descriptions allow calculations of horizontally distributed properties of catchments as a function of distance to the water body by using the concept of the typical water flow path. The study area, situated in a drumlin field in central Finland, included 14 third-order catchments that were further divided into 782 head-water catchments using a 25 m x 25 m digital elevation model. For each head-water catchment, a typical water flow path with slope, elevation, length, relative width, and soil type was calculated. The flow path geometry was diverging towards the water body and there was a 25 m section with a gentle slope adjacent to the water body followed by a steeper slope. Mineral soils dominated throughout the typical water flow path. On the basis of the results, we proposed characteristics for an average head-water catchment with the following properties: area 109.1 ha and length of the water flow path 954 m with maximum elevation 11.5 m. The peatlands were concentrated within a distance of 50 m to the water body; the rest consisted of mineral soil. The results can be utilized, for example, in calculating the impacts of forest management practices on the quality of runoff water. The results offer a baseline for evaluating how typical previously studied catchments are in relation to larger catchment populations. They also enable a regional estimate of the distribution of the relative proportion of areas situated along the water flow path.

AB We examined how hydrology influenced water chemistry, vegetation, nutrient status, aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and litter decomposition rates in two mires on the South-Eastern Alps of Italy. One of the mires had a modest hydraulic gradient and prevalently acted as a recharge system, although there were short phases of vertical flow reversal during dry periods. This mire was, therefore, prevalently fed by rainwater and was covered by bog-like vegetation, mainly hummocks and scrubs with a ground layer rich in Sphagnum mosses. The other mire presented a steeper hydraulic gradient, with the surface being fed by mineral water either by surface runoff or by vertical, upwards directed ground water flow. Compared to the bog-dominated mire, the pore water was less acidic and richer in telluric cations. This mire was covered by fen-like vegetation, prevalently fen meadows. Nitrogen (N) content in the vegetation was very similar in the two mire sites, while phosphorus (P) content was lower in the fen-dominated site. Contrary to our expectations. ANPP did not differ significantly between the two mire sites while litter decomposition rates were significantly lower in the fen-dominated mire, presumably because of P limitation of decomposers. This suggests that the development of ombrogenous mires in this region need not be due to increased accumulation of peat during succession from mineralwater-fed to rainwater-fed conditions.

AB Rewetting Rewetting can promote the ecological recovery of disturbed peatland ecosystems and may help to revert these ecosystems to carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks. However, rewetting of disturbed peatlands can also cause substantial emissions of methane (CH4) and possibly nitrous oxide (N2O). This study quantified summertime emissions of the three major long-lived greenhouse gases (GHGs) CO2, CH4 and N2O; from undisturbed, disturbed and rewetted soils in the Burns Bog Ecological Conservancy Area (BBECA), a 20 km(2) urban bog located in Delta, British Columbia, Canada. Four sites were chosen that represent different stages before or after ecological recovery in the BBECA: (i) a relatively undisturbed scrub pine / Sphagnum / low shrub ecosystem; (ii) a Rhynchospora alba / Sphagnum ecosystem that was disturbed by peat mining more than 65 years ago; (iii) a R. alba / Dulichium arundinaceum ecosystem that was disturbed by peat mining 50 years ago and rewetted five years ago; and (iv) a disturbed and rewetted surface with little vegetation cover that was cleared of vegetation 16 years ago and rewetted two years ago. The GHG fluxes from soils and ground vegetation were measured at all sites during June-August 2014, using a portable non-steady-state chamber system for CO2 and syringe sampling and laboratory analysis for CH4 and N2O fluxes. All four sites exhibited net GHG emissions into the atmosphere, dominated by CH4, which contributed 81-98 % of net CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions. Overall, the median CH4 flux for all measurements and sites was similar to 74 mg m(-2) day(-1) (similar to 30-410 mg m(-2) day(-1), 25th-75th percentiles). Fluxes in the rewetted (water-saturated) sedge ecosystem were highest, with a quarter of the values higher than 3,000 mg m(-2) day(-1) (median 78 mg m(-2) day(-1)). Exchange of CO2 due to photosynthesis and respiration was of secondary importance compared to soil CH4 emissions. Continuous CO2 flux measurements using the eddy covariance approach in the disturbed and rewetted R. alba / Sphagnum site showed that the entire ecosystem, which included tall vegetation, was a weak CO2 sink during the summer (average summertime CO2 uptake of 3.59 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)). No significant emission or uptake of N2O was observed. The results showed that CH4 emissions dominated the net GHG emissions in this disturbed bog at different stages of recovery.

AB Supplemented by information from other organs, such as cones, shoots, leaves and dispersed pollen, anatomical analysis of autochthonous coalified woods and research into dispersed cuticles provides data for reconstructing Miocene peat-swamp vegetations in Central Europe. The present paper is focussed on the description and taphonomical interpretation of conifer remains from the Middle Miocene Second Seam horizon of the Lusatian brown coal field in the Lower Lusatia region (Brandenburg, Germany) exposed in the ancient opencast mine "Meuro" north of Senftenberg.
   Wood-anatomical evidence of occurrence of the genus Sciadopitys is established by the presence of Sciadopityoxylon wettsteinii Jurasky. In addition, remains published as Sciadopitys tertaria Menzel (leaves, cuticles and male cones), Sciadopityspollenites Raatz and a part of rootlets summarized in the morphotaxon Marcoduria inopinata Weyland can be assigned to this genus. The taphonomical dispersion of Sciadopitys remains in the sequence root - trunk - branch - cone - leaf - pollen corresponds to the petrographical turn humotelinitic coal (root coal = "flaserige Kohle" - xylitic coal - "needle" coal) - humodetrinitic coal. The bases of the slender, up to 2.6 in high and relatively small in diameter, tree trunks are sunken into the substratum, which was water-saturated and soft during burial.

AB Belowground climate change responses remain a key unknown in the Earth system. Plant fine-root response is especially important to understand because fine roots respond quickly to environmen-tal change, are responsible for nutrient and water uptake, and influence carbon cycling. However, fine-root responses to climate change are poorly constrained, especially in northern peatlands, which contain up to two-thirds of the world's soil carbon. We present fine-root responses to warming between +2 degrees C and 9 degrees C above ambient conditions in a whole-ecosystem peatland experi-ment. Warming strongly increased fine-root growth by over an order of magnitude in the warmest treatment, with stronger re-sponses in shrubs than in trees or graminoids. In the first year of treatment, the control (+0 degrees C) shrub fine-root growth of 0.9 km m(-2) y(-1) increased linearly by 1.2 km m(-2) y(-1) (130%) for every degree increase in soil temperature. An extended below -ground growing season accounted for 20% of this dramatic in-crease. In the second growing season of treatment, the shrub warming response rate increased to 2.54 km m(-2) degrees C-1. Soil mois-ture was negatively correlated with fine-root growth, highlighting that drying of these typically water-saturated ecosystems can fuel a surprising burst in shrub belowground productivity, one possible mechanism explaining the "shrubification" of northern peatlands in response to global change. This previously unrecognized mech-anism sheds light on how peatland fine-root response to warming and drying could be strong and rapid, with consequences for the belowground growing season duration, microtopography, vegetation composition, and ultimately, carbon function of these globally relevant carbon sinks.

AB Fine-scale dynamics of groundwater flow were studied in a 1.5 ha peatland in central New York. Measurements of the hydraulic head throughout a detailed network of piezometer clusters revealed spatial and temporal variability in the direction of groundwater flow at a very fine (within a few metres) scale of analysis. Within the small wetland, there were areas of groundwater recharge, discharge and lateral flow. Such patterns of ground water flow frequently reversed or changed due to fluctuations of only a few centimetres in hydraulic head. Specific conductance, deuterium signatures and calcium concentrations of groundwater corroborated the groundwater flow patterns determined with hydraulic head measurements and illustrated the influence of source water chemistry and evaporation on different layers in the peat column. The control of pear chemistry by such fine-scale groundwater flow may have important implications for plant community composition and diversity in groundwater-fed peatlands.

TI Ground Water Recharge and Discharge in the Central Everglades
SO GROUND WATER
LA English
DT Article
AB Rates of ground water recharge and discharge are not well known in the central Everglades. Here we report estimates of ground water recharge and discharge at 15 sites in the Everglades Nutrient Removal Project and in Water Conservation Area 2A ( WCA-2A), along with measurements of hydraulic properties of peat at 11 sites. A simple hydrogeologic simulation was used to assess how specific factors have influenced recharge and discharge. Simulations and measurements agreed that the highest values of recharge and discharge occur within 600 m of levees, the result of ground water flow beneath levees. There was disagreement in the interior wetlands of WCA-2A ( located > 1000 m from levees) where measurements of recharge and discharge were substantially higher than simulated fluxes. A five-year time series ( 1997 to 2002) of measured fluxes indicated that recharge and discharge underwent reversals in direction on weekly, monthly, and annual timescales at interior sites in WCA-2A. Ground water discharge tended to occur during average to moderately dry conditions when local surface water levels were decreasing. Recharge tended to occur during moderately wet periods or during very dry periods just as water levels began to increase following precipitation or in response to a pulse of surface water released from water-control structures by water managers. Discharge also tended to occur at sites in the wetland interior for similar to 1 week preceding the arrival of the surface water pulse. We conclude that ground water recharge and discharge vary cyclically in the interior wetlands of the central Everglades, driven by the differential responses of surface water and ground water to annual, seasonal, and weekly trends in precipitation and operation of water-control structures.

AB A peat monolith (15 cm diameter, 35 cm length) from Ellergower Moss (New Galloway, Scotland), kept outdoors and maintained water-saturated, was investigated for the distributions of gases (O(2), CO(2), CH(4)), micro-organisms, total archaeal DNA and methanogen DNA. From the water table (at the surface of the Sphagnum), a steep oxycline gave < 0.25 mu M O(2) at ? cm depth (as shown by membrane inlet mass spectrometry and oxygen electrode methods) and < 10 nM O(2) at 6 cm depth (photobacterium gas diffusion probe). Redox potential measurements indicated a steep decline between 6 cm and 13 cm to a value of -90 mV. At the oxic surface of the peat, CO(2) measured 0.5 mM and CH(4) < 1 mu M. Below 7 cm both gases increased to plateaux at 2 mM and 550 mu M respectively; CH(4) concentrations also indicated two distinct zones (7 mu M to 2.5 cm depth, then to 28 mu M at between 3 and 6 cm). Confocal laser scanning microscopy using the fluorophores 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride or 3,3-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide was used to image micro-organisms with redox active electron transport activities or transmembrane electrochemical potentials, respectively. Samples from 1-5 cm depth showed the presence of active aerobic organisms, whereas those from 10 and 20 cm depth were more active anaerobically, and especially so under H(2). Archaeal DNA was present throughout the core; strongest hybridisation was below 9 cm. Two methanogen-specific primers, ME1 and ME2 (which amplify a region of the alpha-subunit of methyl coenzyme M reductase), hybridised with DNA extracted from below 9 cm depth. Here we describe the concerted application of a number of techniques providing direct information on the precise location and activities of microbes involved in the flux of gases from peatlands.

TI Using hydraulic conductivity and micropetrography to assess water flow

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE peat; hydraulic conductivity; porosity; micropetrography
AB This study focuses on research designed to assess water flow through peat-containing wetlands using hydraulic conductivity (HC) and micropetrography. These goals were accomplished by examining a series of cores taken in a transect through a peat-containing wetland located at the Savannah River Site, South Carolina, and comparing these results with similar measurements from a selected suite of samples from a sample bank of highly characterized peats from other localities. The hydraulic conductivity of all samples was measured using ASTM method D4511-00. In addition, all samples were processed into oriented thin sections to determine porosity and other micropetrographic parameters. The results of this study demonstrate that differences in composition of peat layers found with depth in a peatland can affect water flow through the peatland. In general, the highest hydraulic conductivities tended to be found where the peat layers were high in fiber (fibric to hemic) and light in color (e.g., Nymphaea-dominated aquatic peats). For all core samples, a strong positive correlation was seen between hydraulic conductivity and percentages of macropores (pores >50 mum). The equation found in this study to produce the best prediction of hydraulic conductivity from macropore percentage was y = 0.0002x - 0.0027, where y = hydraulic conductivity (cm/s) and x = percentage of macropores. This study further suggests that the percentages of macropores in peats could be a very useful tool in developing models to predict both direction and speed of water transport through in situ, multi-layered peatlands; whereas either total porosity or macroporosity could be equally useful as predictors of hydraulic conductivity in: (a) the upper 25 cm of peatlands, (b) in shallow constructed wetlands where peats are not greatly compacted by burial, or (c) in peat-based artificial filtering systems. Some applications of these relationships might include predicting flow of ground water in engineered wetlands used for acid mine drainage, predicting past or present flow through more deeply buried peat deposits, or predicting flow of water or gases through lignites or other low rank coal beds.

AB A survey of the existing studies on peat and its decomposition processes is presented with the aim to characterise the long-term behaviour of peat accumulating systems. The chemical and physical characteristics of peat together with its accumulation and decay processes have been analysed.
   Peat is an acidic mixture of dead and decomposed. mainly vegetable, matter formed in boggy areas; it is the youngest and least altered component of the combustible rocks and is characterised by the lowest content of fixed carbon and the highest content of volatile constituents. Peat is formed by degeneration processes under exclusion of atmospheric oxygen by the action of water; the speed of formation depends upon the climatic and environmental conditions.
   In most peatlands two layers can be characterised: the aerobic acrotelm and the anaerobic catotelm, their relative importance being controlled mainly by the position of the water table. In the acrotelm the aerobic processes are responsible for the loss of up to 90% of the original mass, Degeneration in the acidic and anaerobic catotelm is still imperfectly characterised even though the catotelm is the real site of peat accumulation.
   Most of the recent literature considers peat as composed of easily degradable compounds, e.g. polysaccharides. and recalcitrant matter (lignin and complex aromatics). The lone-term destiny of peat has not been sufficiently characterised: although in a large majority of cases it seems probable that peat decomposes completely (even though slowly) provided that it is given a sufficiently long residence rime in the catotelm, some cases can still be interpreted as examples of simple accumulation.
   The rates of influx of oxygen and hence the degradation of organic matter into both saturated and partially saturated peat have been estimated. The depletion rate is about 4500 g m(-1) year(-1) for partially saturated peat. The average depletion rate of the peat for this case will then be such that it will take on the order of 5 to 50 years to degrade half of the organics in a 10 cm partially saturated layer. For the water-saturated case the depletion rate varies between 8 and 12 g m(-2) year(-1), which is considerably lower than in the partially saturated region. The models used to analyse the field and laboratory data on generation, diffusion and emission of methane and carbon dioxide indicate that laboratory data and field observations agree reasonably well.
   It is suggested that peat-accumulating ecosystems may be valuable natural analogues for the study of the long-term destiny of industrial and municipal solid wastes. Accurate studies of active mires together with an ad hoc review of the existing literature give valuable insights in this problem. Peatlands might then be considered as organic waste deposition experiments lasting up to several thousands years. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Permian-Triassic boundary section at Wybung Head, eastern Australia shows a rapid change from humic coal-bearing lowland braided stream through a thin clay and coal breccia and paleosols to semi-arid silt) floodplain deposits. Identifiable plant remains and total organic matter disappear above the coal and cla) breccia. Three characteristic palynofacies accumulated in a range from oxic to sub-oxic to anoxic conditions. The dominance of opaque phytoclasts in the entire sequence reflects deposition under oxic conditions, especially it the sequence lying above the Birdie Coal, the result of fluctuating water tables, high energy and desiccating conditions. In the Birdie Coal, however, at certain horizons, a water-saturated environment favored the pre servation of organic matter such as pollen, spores, and structured organic matter. This latest Permian paleo. vegetation was dominated by opportunistic understory spore-bearing plants, with a canopy of pollen-bearing glossopterids, conifers and cordaitales. Total organic carbon drops from > 30% in the coal, through < 5% in the breccia to < 1% in the paleosols and silts. The organic 513C values are constant at similar to - 25.5 parts per thousand in the coal ant coal breccia, but then decrease to less than - 27 parts per thousand in the paleosols and silts. These results confirm the rapic sedimentary, floral and organic carbon isotope changes across the non-marine Permian-Triassic boundary it eastern Australia. Our delta C-13(org) values suggest a significant and sustained negative delta C-13(org), excursion, with c magnitude of about 3 parts per thousand, above the Birdie Coal. Unlike delta C-13(org), there is no clear trend in delta N-15(org) values. The lots C/N ratios of 10 and less, of the samples above + 55 cm, are only found in modern burned soils with loth bacteria/fungi ratios or in decaying wood. There is no obvious fungal spike in the Wybung Head section, ma) have been destroyed during the formation of this soil B horizon, as elsewhere a global fungal spike layer mark: an interval of decreased terrestrial biomass and decaying vegetation associated with the Permian-Triassic crisis and boundary. Two negative excursions in the uppermost Permian and lowest Triassic can be correlatec throughout Gondwana.

AB Although rewetting practices have been implemented in several cutover raised bogs, their effects on discharge patterns have not received much attention. In 1983, after peat extraction had stopped in the Leegmoor, a cutover raised bog in Germany, an experimental area was set up in order to monitor rewetting and subsequent restoration. Discharge was measured since 1984. The results suggest that rewetted raised bogs may not be effective as regulators of stream flow. An increase of low flows during a decade of rewetting could partly be attributed to weather variation. A comparison of the Leegmoor with a nearby control catchment produced similar results. A shift in the relationship between discharge and groundwater level over time was recorded. This is probably a result of the development of vegetation and a corresponding reduction of the area of open water, leading to an increase of resistance to water flow. The Leegmoor data demonstrate that the daily discharge pattern is most flashy immediately after the start of rewetting and will gradually smooth. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB 1 Runoff production in blanket peat catchments of the northern Pennine hills, UK was measured through monitoring and experimentation at the plot, hillslope and catchment scale. Water flow from soil pipes was measured in one of the study catchments and overland flow, throughflow and water table were measured in runoff plots; rainfall simulation and tension-infiltrometry provided information on infiltration characteristics of the peat.
   2 Saturation-excess overland flow was found to dominate the flashy flow regime; acrotelm stormflow, subsurface pipeflow and macropore flow were also found to be important components of the ecohydrological system.
   3 Surface cover, topography and preferential flowpaths were found to be important factors in controlling infiltration and runoff production.
   4 Streamflow generation processes that are consistent with the acrotelm-catotelm model are shown to occur in blanket peat with and without Sphagnum cover, but in one of the catchments studied an estimated 10% of the discharge bypassed this route and discharged via pipes.
   5 The spatial and temporal variation in hillslope-scale runoff production was demonstrated in the study catchments. This variability in runoff production will be important for hydroecological understanding in peatlands but is often neglected because of over-simplification of processes provided by the traditional two-dimensional acrotelm-catotelm model.

ID RECHARGE-DISCHARGE FUNCTION; LOST RIVER PEATLAND; NORTHERN MINNESOTA;
   ELEMENTS; WETLANDS; JUNEAU; ALASKA
AB Variations in the concentrations of metals in three peat profiles from the Lost River Peatland, Minnesota are related to the degree of groundwater discharge into the peat, rather than the metal content of the peat when it was originally deposited.  Elevated concentrations of metals in the peat profile, particularly from a spring-fen, identify where the greatest volume of groundwater discharge occurs in the peatland.  In each profile, the metal content of the peat corroborates previous hydrologic and geochemical studies showing active groundwater flow in the humified peat, which must have substantial permeability.  Consequently, metal profiles in peat may be used as indicators of the condition of groundwater flow in peatlands where other hydrologic or geochemical information is lacking.

AB Large peatland complexes dominate the landscape of the James Bay Lowland in subarctic Ontario, Canada. However, there is not a thorough understanding of the hydrological processes occurring in these important systems, particularly how ladder fens connect large domed bogs to the aquatic ecosystems that drain the peatland complex. Ladder fens consist of a pool-rib topography where flow downgradient is controlled by the peat ribs. Within the ribs, low-lying preferential flow paths typically enhance the transmission of water, whereas the elevated ridge microforms impede water flow to downgradient aquatic ecosystems. To assess the hydrological connectivity, we study the role of the water table, peat transmissivity, and microtopography of a small ladder fen for 3 summers (2013-2015) in the James Bay Lowland. The system was manipulated with a sustained hydrological forcing (water addition) to the upslope boundary of the fen during 2014 (38 m(3)/day) and 2015 (30 m(3)/day). There was an exponential increase in transmissivity towards the peat surface due to extremely high-hydraulic conductivities within the upper few centimeters of the peat deposit. At the maximum water table, the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the 0.1 m layer of peat below the water table varied depending on peat microtopography (preferential flow paths = 42-598 m/day and ridges = 16-52 m/day), resulting in high-hydrological connectivity periods. Furthermore, during 2015, there was an abnormally large amount of precipitation (300 mm vs. long-term average similar to 100 mm) that resulted in complete surface water connectivity of the site. This caused rapid movement of water from the head of system to the outlet ( similar to 15 hr) and runoff ratios >1, compared to low-water table periods (runoff ratio similar to 0.05). This study highlights the profound importance of the transmissivity-water table feedback mechanism in ladder fens, on controlling the water retention and drainage of large peatland complexes.

AB Anthropogenic drainage of peatlands releases additional greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and dissolved carbon (C) and nutrients to downstream ecosystems. Rewetting drained peatlands offers a possibility to reduce nitrogen (N) and C losses. In this study, we investigate the impact of drainage and rewetting on the cycling of dissolved C and N as well as on dissolved gases, over a period of 1 year and a period of 4 months. We chose four sites within one Atlantic bog complex: a near-natural site, two drained grasslands with different mean groundwater levels and a former peat cutting area rewetted 10 years ago.
   Our results clearly indicate that long-term drainage has increased the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ammonium, nitrate and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) compared to the near-natural site. DON and ammonium contributed the most to the total dissolved nitrogen. Nitrate concentrations below the mean groundwater table were negligible. The concentrations of DOC and N species increased with drainage depth. In the deeply-drained grassland, with a mean annual water table of 45 cm below surface, DOC concentrations were twice as high as in the partially rewetted grassland with a mean annual water table of 28 cm below surface. The deeply drained grassland had some of the highestever observed DOC concentrations of 195.8 +/- 77.3 mg L-1 with maximum values of > 400 mg L-1. In general, dissolved organic matter (DOM) at the drained sites was enriched in aromatic moieties and showed a higher degradation status (lower DOC to DON ratio) compared to the near-natural site. At the drained sites, the C to N ratios of the uppermost peat layer were the same as of DOM in the peat profile. This suggests that the uppermost degraded peat layer is the main source of DOM. Nearly constant DOM quality through the profile furthermore indicated that DOM moving downwards through the drained sites remained largely biogeochemically unchanged. Unlike DOM concentration, DOM quality and dissolved N species distribution were similar in the two grasslands and thus unaffected by the drainage depth.
   Methane production during the winter months at the drained sites was limited to the subsoil, which was quasi-permanently water saturated. The recovery of the water table in the winter months led to the production of nitrous oxide around mean water table depth at the drained sites.
   The rewetted and the near-natural site had comparable DOM quantity and quality (DOC to DON ratio and aromaticity). 10 years after rewetting quasi-pristine biogeochemical conditions have been re-established under continuously water logged conditions in the former peat cut area. Only the elevated dissolved methane and ammonium concentrations reflected the former disturbance by drainage and peat extraction. Rewetting via polder technique seems to be an appropriate way to revitalize peatlands on longer timescales and to improve the water quality of downstream water bodies.

AB We investigated the impacts of resource access roads on soil enzyme activities in contrasting forested boreal peatlands (bog and fen). In August 2016, a total of 72 peat samples were collected from twelve 20 m long transects perpendicular to access roads, with a further six samples collected fromundisturbed reference areas. Sampling locations represent a range in three variables associated with roads: 1) side of the road (upstream/downstream), 2) distance to a culvert (longitudinal; <2 and >20 m), and 3) distance from the road (lateral; 2, 6, and 20 m). Phenol oxidase and hydrolase (glucosidase, sulfatase, xylosidase, glucosaminidase, and phosphatase) enzyme activities were determined for each sample, in addition to water table depth, phenolic concentration, pH, and peat temperature. The average hydrolase activities in the fen were similar to four times higher than in the bog. At the bog, the water table depth, phenolic concentration, pH and the activities of phenol oxidase, sulfatase, glucosidase, xylosidase and glucosaminidase were all significantly influenced by one or more road associated factors. The highest enzyme activities in the bog occurred on the downstream side of the road at plots located far from the culvert. In contrast, the flow of water in the fen was not perpendicular to the road. Consequently, no significant variations in water table depth, phenolic concentration, pH or enzyme activity were found with respect to road associated factors. Results indicate that road crossings in boreal peatlands can indirectly alter enzyme activities, likely as part of a causal chain following changes to hydrology and redox conditions. Two of six investigated enzymes had significantly higher activities in the road disturbed areas compared to undisturbed areas, suggesting ultimately that roads may enhance organic matter decomposition rates. However, adequate hydrologic connections through culverts and road construction parallel to the water flow can minimize the road-induced impacts. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI REGULARITIES OF CHEMICAL ELEMENTS DISTRIBUTION IN VERTICAL PROFILE OF

AB The relevance of the research is substantiated by the necessity to develop the assessment criteria for the environmental conditions. Bottom sediments accumulate chemical elements incoming to the water reservoirs from natural and anthropogenic sources, and can be an indicator for the anthropogenic change of environment.
   The aim of the research is to study the change specificity of chemical element composition and to identify possible sources of chemical elements into bottom sediments of low flow water reservoirs in the southern part of Tomsk region.
   Research methods: detailed small-section testing of bottom sediments in the low flow water reservoirs of different types, instrumental neutron activation analysis (quantitative estimation of 29 chemical elements), atomic absorption method - cold vapor) method (Hg estimation), alpha -spectrometry (Am-241) and gamma-spectrometry (Cs-137,Pb-210).
   Research findings. The author has pointed out three types of low flow water reservoirs by the nature of element distribution in the vertical profile of bottom sediments of low flow water reservoirs in Tomsk region. The first one is a type of equal distribution with weakly shown abnormities (Lake Larino (Lake Um)). This indicates the essentially clastogenic impurity elements income to the waters. The second one is a type of weakly differentiated distribution with occurrence of mild abnormities in the upper part (the lake in the Timiryazevskoe village), related to circulating and unsteady pollutants income to the water, for example, as a result of flooding. The third type is the one of rapid differentiated distribution with the contrasting abnormities (Lake Chyornoe), which identify the sharp change of geochemical situation in the period of 1950-1960-s. It shows the 10 cm interval in the vertical core sample of bottom sediments. The geochemical association change can be associated with the development of the Siberian Chemical Combine and with the beginning of industrial restructuring of Tomsk.

AB Matlabas is a mountain mire in Marakele National Park, located within the headwaters of the Limpopo River in South Africa. This mire consists of a complex of valley-bottom and seepage wetlands with small elevated peat domes. The occurrence of one decaying peat dome, which has burnt, and desiccated wetland areas with terrestrial vegetation has raised concerns. The aim of this study was to understand the mire features and water flows in order to identify the potential drivers causing wetland degradation. Wells and piezometers were installed to monitor the hydraulic head and collect water samples for analysis of ion composition, O-18 and H-2 stable isotope content, and delta C-13 and C-14 isotope content for radiocarbon dating. Moreover, peat temperature profiles were measured and peat deposits were also dated using radiocarbon. Results indicate that the Matlabas mire developed in the lowest central-east side of the valley by paludification at the onset of the Holocene. During the Mid-Holocene, peat development was extended laterally by autogenic and allogenic processes. Three types of water flows driving peat development were identified - sheet flow, phreatic groundwater flow and deep groundwater flow - two of which are surface or near surface flows. The recent occurrence of decaying peat domes and desiccated wetland areas is possibly related to loss of exfiltrating deep groundwater flows that have resulted from drainage by the head-cut channels in the mire and interception of near surface water flow by an access road, respectively. Interventions should be undertaken to prevent further degradation of the mire.
   Significance:
   This study is the first, as far as we are aware, on the ecohydrology of an inland mountainous mire in southern Africa.
   The results highlight the importance of the current wetland management (including rehabilitation) initiatives in South Africa.
   The integrative ecohydrological methods can be applied in other headwater wetlands in southern Africa.

ID SOIL
AB Wetlands are mostly characterized by a large proportion of open water and frequent inundation. In most soil water flow models little attention is payed to phenomena related to open water. In this study, limitations of one dimensional soil water flow models in wetlands are identified. A simple model approach for incorporating the relation between open water and groundwater in soil water flow models is introduced. This model concept is implemented in an extended version of the SWATRE model and tested with data from three lowland raised mires (Engbertdijksvenen, Fochteloerveen (The Netherlands) and Leegmoor (Germany)). The model runs are evaluated by comparing measured and calculated groundwater levels. Results show that the runs with the extended SWATRE model (Standard Error of estimate 4.32-10.9 cm) are considerably better than runs with the standard SWATRE model (Standard Error of estimate 17.6-33.2 cm). It is concluded that a modified quasi two-dimensional approach improves the simulation of water table fluctuations in wetlands.

AB Heat was used as a natural tracer to characterize shallow ground water flow beneath a complex wetland system. Hydrogeologic data were combined with measured vertical temperature profiles to constrain a series of two-dimensional, transient simulations of ground water flow and heat transport using the model code SUTRA (Voss 1990). The measured seasonal temperature signal reached depths of 2.7 m beneath the pond. Hydraulic conductivity was varied in each of the layers in the model in a systematic manual calibration of the two-dimensional.model to obtain the best fit to the measured temperature and hydraulic head. Results of a series of representative best-fit simulations represent a range in hydraulic conductivity values that had the best agreement between simulated and observed temperatures and that resulted in simulated pond seepage values within 1 order of magnitude of pond seepage estimated from the water budget. Resulting estimates of ground water discharge to an adjacent agricultural drainage ditch were used to estimate potential dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loads resulting from the restored wetland. Estimated DOC loads ranged from 45 to 1340 g C/(m(2) year), which is higher than estimated DOC loads from surface water. In spite of the complexity in characterizing ground water flow in peat soils, using heat as a tracer provided a constrained estimate of subsurface flow from the pond to the agricultural drainage ditch.

AB Surface water chemistry of two mires was studied in an area with siliceous bedrock and consequently dilute fen waters. Range of variation from moderately rich fen to ombro-trophic bog vegetation was found. Rich fen vegetation was found in Ca concentrations similar to bogs and poor fens, found in many other studies. The poor-rich gradient was related most distinctly to pH, alkalinity, conductivity and the concentrations of Mg and Na. Contrary to the vertical isolation theory of development from fen to bog, in our study the poor-rich gradient was found in an inverse vertical sequence. In the case of weakly buffered waters, downstream spatial succession of water chemistry, including accumulation of organic acidity, is suggested to play a part in the development of the poor-rich gradient. The variation of Al, Fe, Mn and S was found to form a partly independent chemical gradient, related to surface water flow from a podzolic catchment.

AB Nutrient loss from altered wetlands to waterways may influence the water quality of downstream water resources. To test potential nutrient transport from a highly fractured agricultural field of altered wetland to waterways, we computed water and solute budgets in a large field (320 ha) experiment. The water level was raised in a drainage canal for 28 days (raising stage) to generate water flow to the field and then lowered (drainage stage) to generate back flow to the canal. Differential sampling stations (DISS) equipped with an Eh-pH measuring system were installed to monitor and sample crack and matrix water separately. Water flowing in cracks exhibited Eh >250 mV and EC < 1.5 dS m(-1) while in the matrix, the Eh was <100 mV and EC exceeded 3.0 dS m(-1). High similarity was found between crack water measured in the DISS and water that drained directly into the drainage canal. We proposed a conceptual model for water and solute transport by a dual-domain system. Most of the water flow occurs in the cracks and most of the solute reaches the cracks by advection and diffusive flow mechanisms in the soil matrix. The conceptual model is based on the assumption that the crack and matrix domains are in chemical disequilibrium because of low transport rate from the matrix to the cracks relative to water flow rate in the cracks. Using this conceptual model, we calculated that during the drainage stage, only 0.64 kg P, compared with 3700 kg of the non-sorptive sulfate ion, were transported from the field to the canal. The oxidized conditions in the crack walls lead to Fe-hydroxide precipitation. These fresh precipitate amorphous iron hydroxides serve as an adsorption sink to P and other potential adsorbates.

AB Hydrometric measurements, electrical conductivity, water isotopic and hydrochemical components of stream water were used to study summer runoff generation in a flat fen. Different processes generated runoff at low- and high-flows. At storm-flows, fen runoff was generated from overland flow, originating from upland surface water. Temporary storage of water on the fen surface attenuated and delayed flow peaks. At tow-flows, runoff at the fen outlet was generated from shallow subsurface flow in the Acrotelm. During low-flow periods, water originated mainly from peat storage water while during episodic events the wetland water storage was renewed by inflowing stream water. Assessment and modeling of hydrological effects of peatlands should be performed separately for tow-flows and high-flows, based on the dominating runoff generating processes. Attenuation and retardation of storm-flows in fens by temporary surface storage will depend on the geometric properties of both storage sections and sections controlling outflow. A routing reservoir model adapted for flat fens can be used for simulation of attenuation and retardation in runoff events, and it is suggested that the model concept should be tested for a broader range of peatlands.

AB Drainage rejuvenation through headward migration of alluvial knickpoints is common in ephemeral semi-arid streams, but has not yet been described for tropical rivers. In the Australian monsoon tropics (AMT), wet monsoon forests have an important ecological function, and are present along many alluvial valleys and springs within a eucalypt-savanna dominated landscape. Using a combination of LiDAR, remote sensing and field evidence, we observe the ongoing destruction of wet monsoon forest through hydro-geomorphic feedbacks, along with the headward retreat of an alluvial knickpoint at Wangi Creek in Litchfield National Park, Northern Territory. Due to the highly transmissive shallow aquifer along the lower Wangi Creek, this knickpoint retreat leads to a downstream drop in in-channel water level, which in turn drives a decrease in the local groundwater table. The lowered groundwater level causes the shallow anabranches and formerly water saturated peaty floodplain soil to desiccate, which results in a reduction of vegetation density. The resulting dry surface conditions allow annual to bi-annual high frequency low-intensity fires to affect the monsoon forest, while wet rainforest upstream of the knickpoint remains intact. In this paper, we argue that such hydro-geomorphic feedbacks may cause the initial destabilization of the forest, which then provides the necessary conditions for the impact of fire. This scenario thus challenges the prevalent view that fire is a first-order control on the spatial extent of wet monsoonal rainforest in the study area, and provides a new and testable hypothesis for further studies in the AMT.

AB Scientific knowledge of the wet zone - the lagg - that tends to form at the edge of ombrotrophic peatlands is surprisingly limited. In this study, we aim to improve the understanding of the ecohydrological functions of this transition by describing the form and abiotic controls of the laggs and margins of bog peatlands. Data collected in wells and piezometers along 10 transects (within 6 bogs), of the New Brunswick Eastern Lowlands are used to analyse the hydraulic and hydrochemical gradients, while airborne LiDAR data provides new insight on the geomorphology and the vegetation patterns of the bog-lagg-mineral transition zone. Based on their geomorphic character, the study transects are placed into 2 categories: confined and unconfined. Laggs of confined transition are found in a topographic depression, between the bog and a mineral slope >1%, while laggs of unconfined transitions are adjacent to a flat (<= 1%) or receding mineral slope (sloping away from the lagg). Water level (4 +/- 9 cm vs. -3 +/- 9 cm), pH (4.8 +/- 0.9 vs. 4.2 +/- 0.4), electrical conductivity (ECcorr) (105 +/- 52 mu S cm(-1) vs. 52 +/- 28 mu S cm(-1)) and peat depth (55 +/- 9 cm vs. 30 +/- 9 cm) are found to be higher, respectively, for the confined laggs than for the unconfined. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) of the lagg's upper peat layer resembles that of bog environments, but quickly reduces with depth, impeding Vertical water flow. The greatest abiotic control of the lagg appears to be topography, which affects water flow rates and direction, thus water chemistry, nutrient transport and availability, hence vegetation characteristics.

AB Soil gas production processes, mainly anaerobic or aerobic soil respiration, drive major gas fluxes across the soil-atmosphere interface. Carbon dioxide (CO2) effluxes, an efflux which in most ecosystems is a result of both autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration, in particular have received international attention. The importance of both CO2 and methane (CH4) fluxes are emphasised in the Arctic because of the large amount of soil organic carbon stored in terrestrial ecosystems and changes in uptake and release due to climate changes.
   This chapter focuses on controls on spatial and temporal trends in subsurface CO2 and CH4 production as well as on transport and release of gases from the soil observed in the valley Zackenbergdalen. A dominance of near-surface temperatures controlling both spatial and seasonal trends is shown based on data obtained using closed chamber and eddy-correlation techniques as well as in manipulated field plots and in controlled incubation experiments. Despite variable temperature sensitivities reported, most data can be fairly well fitted to exponential temperature-dependent equations. The water content (at wet sites linked to the depth to the water table) is a second major factor regulating soil respiration processes, but the effect is quite different in contrasting vegetation types. Dry heath sites are shown to be periodically water limited during the growing season and respond therefore with high respiration rates when watered. In contrast, water saturated conditions during most of the growing season in the fen areas hinder the availability of oxygen, resulting in both CO2 and CH4 production. Thus, water table drawdown results in decreasing CH4 effluxes but increasing CO2 effluxes.
   Additional controls on gas production are shown to be related to the availability of substrate and plant productivity. Subsurface gas production will produce partial and total pressure gradient causing gas transport, which in well-drained soils is mainly controlled by diffusion, whereas gas advection, bubbles and transport through roots and stems may be important in more saturated soils.
   Bursts of CO2 gas have been observed during spring thaw and confirmed in controlled soil thawing experiments. Field observations as well as experimental work suggest that such bursts represent partly on-going soil respiration and a physical release of gas produced during the winter. The importance of winter soil respiration is emphasised because of the fact that microbial respiration in Zackenberg samples is noted down to a least -18 degrees C. Hence, the importance of winter respiration and burst events in relation to seasonal and future climate trends requires more than just summer measurements. For example, the autumn period seems important as snowfall prior to low air temperature may insulate the soil, keeping soil temperatures high. This will extend the period of high soil respiration rates and thereby increase the importance of the winter period for the annual carbon balance.
   Because of the complexity of factors controlling subsurface gas production, we conclude that different parts of the landscape will respond quite differently to the same climate changes as well as that short-term effects are likely to be different from long-term effects.

TI CALCIUM CONCENTRATIONS IN WETLAND GROUNDWATER IN RELATION TO WATER

AB Over the past several decades, vegetation communities in lowland wetlands in Western Europe have changed. Species-rich, low-productivity (i.e. low primary biomass production) communities characteristic of rich fens (fens characterized by minerophilous species) have declined and are being replaced by vegetation communities characteristic of high-productivity rich fens, poor fens (fens characterized by ombrophilous species) and bogs. High concentrations of calcium in groundwater are generally believed to be an important controlling factor on the vegetation of rich fens. Management for the protection of low-productivity rich fens therefore generally aims at conservation of calcareous groundwater conditions in the root zone of lowland wetlands.
   This paper relates the occurrence of calcium-rich groundwater in lowland wetlands of the Central Netherlands to water sources and soil conditions in the groundwater recharge area. The chemical composition of the following groundwater types is compared: groundwater recharged at a sandy ridge adjacent to the wetland area (ridge water); groundwater recharged by precipitation within the wetland (peat water); groundwater recharged by surface water in the wetland. Objective hydrological criteria are used to classify groundwater analyses according to recharge area. Oxygen-18 proved an essential criterion for the distinction between genetic groundwater types. It is therefore recommended to make oxygen-18 analysis standard procedure in geohydrological wetland research. Calcium concentrations are generally not suitable as tracers of different types of recharge areas.
   All groundwater types contain calcium. In contrast to what is generally assumed, lowest concentrations are observed in ridge water. Higher calcium concentrations are found in groundwater recharged in wetlands, especially in infiltrated surface water. Nutrient concentrations in both ridge and peat water are low, while those in infiltrated surface water are significantly higher.
   The main conclusion for nature conservation is that calcium-rich and mesotrophic conditions in the root zone can be realised not only by the seepage of groundwater from upland sandy recharge areas, as is generally thought, but also by the seepage of peat water. This is important as a severe deterioration in the quality of ridge water seeping upward on the river plain may be anticipated in the near future. which forms a threat to low-productivity rich fens. Peat water may offer an alternative water source for the conservation or regeneration of low-productivity rich fens. forms at threat to low-productivity rich fens. Peat water may offer an alternative water source for the conservation or regeneration of low-productivity rich fens.

AB The germination requirements of Cladium jamaicense Crantz and Typha domingensis Pers. were studied under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Treatments included six temperature regimes, (constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30 degrees C, and two fluctuating day : night temperature regimes of 25 : 10 degrees C and 30 : 20 degrees C), two light levels (14 : 10 h light : dark photoperiod and 24 h dark environment), two substrates (peat and water) and two O-2 levels (atmospheric and low (4.34%) O-2 concentration) using a complete randomized block design.
   The average incubation period needed for seeds to germinate was shorter for T. domingenesis (1.1-19.5 days) than for C. jamaicense (26-46 days) and the final germination percentage was higher for T. domingensis than for C. jamaicense (85 vs. 42 %). Cladium jamaicense only germinated with fluctuating temperatures whereas T. domingensis germinated at all temperature regimes. Light was required for T. domingensis seeds to germinate, whereas C. jamaicense could germinate at a reduced rate in the dark. Peat substrate had a positive effect on germination in both species. Peat substrate shortened the incubation period for seeds of both species, enhanced germination of T. domingensis, especially at low temperatures, and enhanced germination of C. jamaicense in the dark. Low oxygen availability did not influence the germination of C. jamaicense but enhanced germination of T. domingensis at low temperatures. Although the two species differ significantly in their germination requirements and responses to specific environmental conditions, germination of both these species was enhanced by environmental conditions typical of exposed water saturated mudflats or sediment surfaces. Typha domingensis produces a large number of small seeds, which do not germinate when covered by sediment. In contrast, C. jamaicense produces fewer and larger seeds, with resources able to support growth through a thin layer of sediment or detritus. (C)2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI WATER-BUDGET AND FLOW PATTERNS IN AN URBAN WETLAND
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The hydrologic budget of a streamside urban peatland in south central Wisconsin, USA, was constructed, and the patterns of groundwater and surface water flow were described over a 2 year period. Precipitation and surface flow comprised over 95% of the inputs to the wetland, while evapotranspiration was the major output. Evapotranspiration was significantly lower in cattail-dominated sections of the wetland. Low piezometric heads in and below the aquitard underneath the peatland created weak downward gradients from the wetland to the aquifer below. Within the peat itself, weak upward or discharge gradients were dominant. Three major patterns of horizontal shallow groundwater flow were seen, but shallow gradients and low hydraulic conductivities prevented large inputs or outputs of water through these pathways. The wetland has a large capacity for flood storage, but it did not make significant contributions to groundwater supplies or to streamflow during the time of this study. Error analysis revealed enormous uncertainties in many of the components of the budget.

AB Anisotropy of saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s, m s(-1)) is a major input datum required for the modeling of saturated and unsaturated water flow in soils, significantly improving the reliability of the models. But, there are several known literature reports presenting positively verified examples of modeling of infiltration in horizontally layered small-scale soil profiles without taking anisotropy into consideration. The objective of this paper is to analyze the influence of implementing the anisotropy ratio to the two-dimensional mathematical model of unsaturated flow in a selected small-scale multilayered soil profile on the possible improvement of calculations results. Two methods of soil sampling for anisotropy measurement were considered-small cylinder and cubic sampling. Our numerical model reflected the profile of a single bench terrace equipped additionally with draining sand ditch, located in Olszanka, Poland. The simple regression analysis indicated that implementing the ratio of anisotropy of saturated hydraulic conductivity to the mathematical model of variably saturated water flow in the studied horizontally layered soil profiles did not result in more precise effects of time-variable soil moisture calculations (R-2 = 0.773-0.883, P = 0.05). Moreover, results of the statistical calculations for volumetric water content and vertical flow velocity, assuming isotropic and anisotropic medium with anisotropy coefficient obtained on the basis of cylindrical and cubic samples, appeared to be comparable; the notable differences were observed only in the case of calculated horizontal flow velocity.

AB The understanding of flow processes is one of the key elements in evaluating treatment efficiency in constructed wetlands. This study use a new method based on analysis of stabile oxygen and hydrogen isotope distributions in surface water in order to find water flow pathways in a treatment system established on a natural peatland in Ruka, Finland. The O-18/O-16 distributions of surface water samples were analysed in three field campaigns (2002, 2004, and 2005) and H-2/H-1 distribution in one field campaign (2002). Two conventional tracer (KBr and KI) tests and a tracer (NaCl) test in ground water tubes were conducted to study residence times and soil water flow characteristics. Online registration of electrical conductivity and temperature were used to analyse the NaCI experiment. The results showed clear spatial differences in O-18/O-16 distributions that were similar in each field campaign. Both O-18/O-16 and H-2/H-1 also varied clearly with depth until 40 cm. The results indicate that a strong preferential pathway exists in the wetland and that the water flows mainly in the top of peat layer. The observed flow path was the reason for the varying NH4-N distribution showing that a large potential area for nutrient removal is not used. The results show that the isotope method can be used to evaluate the water flow structure in peatlands and determinate the active flow area for wastewater purification. Along with the traditional tracer test the method can be used to estimate the active flow volume. A modification to the potential residence time equation is proposed by including active flow area, flow depth and an effective porosity. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands are a dominant land feature in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) of the Western Boreal Plain (WBP), comprising > 50% of the total land area, many of which are moderate-rich fens. The carbon stocks of moderate-rich fens in the WBP are susceptible to degradation through anthropogenic- and climate-related factors, yet, few studies have aimed to understand their hydrologic function. This study, located in a meltwater channel belt characterized by relatively thin outwash sand and gravel (similar to 6 m) underlying the peat, provides the first hydrological assessment of a moderate-rich fen in the AOSR. The lithology, hydrological function and groundwater geochemistry all point to the dominance of a local flow system supplying groundwater to the fen areas, evidenced by a thick (similar to 16 m) and shallow (similar to 7 m below ground surface) aquitard underlying the outwash, restricting hydrological connectivity between the fen and underlying regional aquifers. Vertical hydraulic gradients between the peat and underlying outwash aquifer, and horizontal hydraulic gradients between the fen and upland varied in response to both short-term and seasonal precipitation trends. Groundwater discharge to the fen was enhanced during wet periods characterized by high rainfall. Conversely, flow reversals (groundwater recharge; fen to underlying aquifer and upland), and subsequently, enhanced fen water table drawdown persisted during extended dry periods. This local groundwater flow-system influences recharge/discharge patterns at Poplar Fen, with hydraulic head in the underlying outwash aquifer highly susceptible to fluctuations in the presence and absence of precipitation-driven recharge from adjacent uplands. Moderate-rich fens similar to that studied here will likely become more susceptible to drying in the future due to a changing climate, leading to enhanced water table drawdown, peat oxidation and subsequent decomposition, vulnerability to wildfire, and seral succession to a more ombrogenous peatland system.

AB Extraction of gold from quartz-carbonate shear zones has left a barren deposit of tailings at Central Manitoba mine, which remains unchanged after 70 years. In this study, the shape of the basin, the groundwater and surface water flow regime, and the electrical conductivity of the tailings have been delineated using a combination of geotechnical, geophysical, and geochemical techniques. Groundwater and surface water flow from the north-south-fractured bedrock outwards to the east and west. A component of upward groundwater movement in the deposit is due to evaporation in hot, dry summers, limited recharge from precipitation, and the tailings basin being a local groundwater discharge zone. Electromagnetic surveys indicate that the thickness of the tailings and underlying peat bog material increases from similar to 1 m at the south of the tailings to similar to 5 m at the north. The surveys provided an effective way of mapping the spatial distribution of acidic pore fluids and associated increased salinity. Zones of acidification, occurring mainly on the south side of the tailings, support the hypothesis that acidification is due to differential settling during the initial discharge of carbonate and sulfide minerals.

ID CONSOLIDATION
AB This paper presents the behavior of the soft subsoil under structures such as embankment dams, particularly tailing dams which are nowadays usually placed in swampy areas often dominated by organic soils, such as peat. Structures construction on soft organic soils makes it necessary to calculate subsoil deformations with special consideration of the water flow. Constructions of embankments on soft organic soils cause many problems because of their specific properties. The organic soils, such as peat, are characterized by high porosity and low shear strength as well as high initial permeability which decreases during consolidation. In the deformation process of soil skeleton under loading the porosity decreases and causes changes of flow characteristics. Therefore, the water flow characteristics are very important to be considered in predicting and calculating the subsoil deformation under load. The specific behavior of soft subsoil demands estimation reliability of the flow characteristics. Therefore in the statistical analysis suitable statistical methods and proper measures in laboratory tests should be used. Several statistical functions have been applied to analyze the flow-pump test data in order to provide a correct estimation of flow characteristics in soft soils. In this paper, the results of water flow characteristics obtained in laboratory tests and the estimation of flow characteristics in soft organic soils are presented.

AB Methane flux in a boreal wetland in central Saskatchewan, Canada was measured by a static chamber technique. The northern ribbed fen site was part of the Boreal Ecosystem and Atmospheric Study. The results indicated temperature, water level relative to the peat surface, vegetative type and P concentrations in interstitial water all had an influence on CH4 emission rates. Methane fluxes from peat at the site ranged from 176 to 2250 mmol CH4 m(-2) yr(-1), exceeding those commonly reported for other freshwater wetlands around the world. The CH4 flux rates increased from 1.08 at the edge of the fen to 13.80 mmol CH4 m-2 d(-1) near the center. Methane flux was directly correlated with water levels and temperature at all measurement locations except two in the central part of the fen where fluxes became lower. The lower correlation of water levels and temperature with CH4 flux in sites located at the fen center may be attributed to other more restricting variables created by the water flow through the center of the fen. Methane flux rates in sites with limited water flow were also positively correlated with P concentrations in interstitial water at 50 cm, the depth where CH4 is likely to be produced.

AB We evaluated the feasibility of using testate amoebae to infer the quantitative paleohydrology of ombrotrophic mires during their early stages (fen and fen-bog transition) of development. Two transfer functions, one derived from ombrotrophic and the other from minerotrophic mires, were applied to a peat core from an ombrotrophic mire in a taiga region of west Siberia. An ombrotrophic transfer function was applied to the bog stage of mire development. In contrast, ombrotrophic and minerotrophic transfer functions were applied independently to infer water table depth in the fen and fen-bog transition stages. Results of the two approaches for calculating water table depth during the fen and fen-bog transition stages differed by as much as 38 cm for the same peat sample. The main reason for this discrepancy is presence of testate amoeba taxa (e.g. Centropyxis aculeata, Cyclopyxis eurystoma, Cyclopyxis eurystoma v. parvula) in the peat that inhabit both modern ombrotrophic and minerotrophic mires, but differ substantially, in cases by > 20 cm, in terms of their water table depth optima in the ombrotrophic and minerotrophic mire calibration data sets. This difference in inferred water table depth also stems, to a lesser degree, from the fact that the ombrotrophic mire model does not include taxa that inhabited exclusively minerotrophic mires in the fen and fen-bog transition stages. Given these findings, we propose that different models be used for different stages of development, to reconstruct past water table depth in ombrotrophic mires. We recommend use of a model based solely on the ombrotrophic mire data set for the bog stage, and application of a second model based on the minerotrophic mire data set, for the fen and fen-bog transition stages. Application of an ombrotrophic model to the early stages of bog development can yield erroneous paleohydrological reconstructions.

AB Calcareous fens are species-rich peatlands that are dependent on minerotrophic water sources for wetland functioning, with current conceptual models suggesting the water source is ubiquitously groundwater upwelling. By quantifying the water balance and subsurface water flow paths and fluxes over 3 growing seasons for calcareous fens in 3 different hydrogeomorphic settings (Riparian, Trough, and Basin), we show evidence that challenges this conceptual model. The Riparian Fen received an order of magnitude more water inputs than the Trough or Basin Fens and was dominated by stream recharge inputs and groundwater outputs. Precipitation and evaporation dominated the water balance of the Trough Fen whereas only the Basin Fen received sizeable groundwater inputs. Indeed, subsurface water fluxes were low at all fens due to weak hydraulic gradients and low saturated hydraulic conductivity in some areas of each wetland, though variations in growing season precipitation led to subsurface flow reversals in all 3 fens. Our results demonstrate the importance of understanding landscape position, or hydrogeomorphic setting, on calcareous fen hydrology for improving conservation, management, and restoration efforts of these important ecosystems.

AB 1. Groundwater-peatland interactions were assessed by a regional survey in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, where the rapid rate of isostatic uplift has perturbed hydrological flow systems across a 6000-year chronosequence.
   2. A 24 000 km(2) study area along the Albany River consists of 55% fen, 35% bog and 10% mineral soil. The peatland vegetation may be further subdivided into 11 noda, which are closely related to different water levels, ranges in water chemistry, and peat landform type. Species richness generally declines with increasing water level and acidity, whereas the gradient from bog to extremely rich fen is marked by the changing abundance and occurrence of fen-indicator species.
   3. Bog landforms are restricted to physiographic settings where surface waters flow downwards and the bog vegetation is therefore isotated from the influence of geogenous waters. In contrast, fens are located in areas where mineral solutes are transported to the peat surface either by upwelling groundwater or by advective/dispersion along lateral flow paths.
   4. Peatlands spread across the study area between 6000 and 3000 BP, coinciding with the emergence of new land from the sea. The release of organic acids from the nearly continuous peat cover acidified this calcareous landscape, leading to the convergence of the surface-water chemistry into four discrete groupings of pH vs. calcium.
   5. Isostatic uplift, however, continues to alter the topography, fluvial geometry and groundwater flow systems of the lowlands, maintaining diverse peatland types on land surfaces of similar age. The formation of water-table mounds under the interfluvial divides and rising moraine system spurred the development of raised bogs, whereas the formation of regional seepage faces for goundwater on the margins of the moraine and rivers of the till plain maintains large areas of fen.
   6. Although peatland succession seems to follow predictable pathways within a given hydrogeological setting, these pathways are locally altered by tectonic drivers that continually modify surface and groundwater flow systems. In this large peat basin the pace and pathway of peatland succession seems to be driven by tectonic rather than climatic forcing.

AB The saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) is a key characteristic of porous media, describing the rate of water flow through saturated porous media. It is an indispensable parameter in a broad range of simulation models that quantify saturated and/or unsaturated water flow. The constant-head permeameter test is a common laboratory method to determine K-s on undisturbed soil samples collected from the field. In this paper we show that the application of this conventional method may result in a biased K-s in the case of highly permeable media, such as the top layer of Sphagnum peat and gravel. Tubes in the conventional permeameter, that collect water under the sample, introduce a hydraulic head-dependent resistance for highly permeable media and result in an underestimation of K-s.We present a simple and low-budget alternative of the constant-head permeameter test that overcomes the disadvantages of conventional permeameters. The new method was successfully tested on intact highly permeable peatmoss collected from a northern peatland.
   Conventional constant-head permeameters underestimate K-s of highly permeable media due to flow resistance in tubing systems
   We developed the low-resistance permeameter to overcome this disadvantage.
   Testing of the low-resistance permeameter demonstrated no systematic bias and successful application for highly permeable media. (c) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A vast, ground-water-supported sedge fen in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA was ditched in the early 1900 s in a failed attempt to promote agriculture. Dikes were later constructed to impound seasonal sheet surface flows for waterfowl management. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, which now manages the wetland as part of Seney National Wildlife Refuge, sought to redirect water flows from impounded C-3 Pool to reduce erosion in downstream Walsh Ditch, reduce ground-water losses into the ditch, and restore sheet flows of surface water to the peatland. A water budget was developed for C-3 Pool, which serves as the central receiving and distribution body for water in the affected wetland. Surface-water inflows and outflows were measured in associated ditches and natural creeks, ground-water flows were estimated using a network of wells and piezometers, and precipitation and evaporation/evapotranspiration components were estimated using local meteorological data. Water budgets for the 1999 springtime peak flow period and the 1999 water year were used to estimate required releases of water from C-3 Pool via outlets other than Walsh Ditch and to guide other restoration activities. Refuge managers subsequently used these results to guide restoration efforts, including construction of earthen darns in Walsh Ditch upslope from the pool to stop surface flow, installation of new water-control structures to redirect surface water to sheet flow and natural creek channels, planning seasonal releases from C-3 Pool to avoid erosion in natural channels, stopping flow in downslope Walsh Ditch to reduce erosion, and using constructed earthen dams and natural beaver dams to flood the ditch channel below C-3 Pool. Interactions between ground water and surface water are critical for maintaining ecosystem processes in many wetlands, and management actions directed at restoring either ground- or surface-water flow patterns often affect both of these components of the water budget. This approach could thus prove useful in guiding restoration efforts in many hydrologically altered and managed wetlands worldwide. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The marked differences among species are therefore attributed to differences in plant material quality, though C/N ratio is shown not to be of main influence. Based on low decomposition rates, Phragmites australis proved the species most suitable for (renewed) peat accumulation under sufficient wet conditions.

LA English
DT Article
AB Canadian peatlands can be classified into ombrotrophic bogs and minerotrophic fens, the latter subdivided into poor, moderate-rich, and extreme-rich fens, each with distinctive indicator species, acidity, alkalinity, and base cation content.  If hydrology is considered the most important factor in peatland classification then the primary division must be between ombrotrophic bogs and minerotrophic fens; however both chemical and vegetational differences strongly indicate that the primary division of peatlands should be between acidic, Sphagnum-dominated bogs and poor fens on the one hand, and alkaline, brown-moss-dominated rich fens on the other.  Although some metals such as sulphur and aluminum also vary along this gradient, nutrient contents of the surface waters do not.  Bogs and fens are oligotrophic to mesotrophic wetlands that should be distinguished from eutrophic, non-peat-forming wetlands such as marshes and swamps by the presence in the former of a well-developed ground layer of bryophytes associated with relatively little seasonal water level fluctuation.  Oligotrophy is probably maintained in bogs and poor fens by reduced water flow, whereas rich fens maintain mesotrophy by having larger water through-puts; however this is not well documented.  Sphagnum appears to have real ecological significance, both in the initial stages of acidification and in controlling surface water temperature.  Seasonal variation in surface water chemistry in all peatland types is relatively small, however precipitation events leading to changes in water levels do affect some chemical components.  Although both autogenic and allogenic factors affect peatland development, initiation of peat formation and early development of peatlands during the Early and Mid Holocene were considerably influenced by regional climatic change.  Later developmental patterns during the late Holocene and those seen at the present time appear to be more influenced by autogenic factors.

   Forestry operations can cause disturbances in nutrient cycling. Protection of watercourses by trapping the leached solids and nutrients in sedimentation ponds and buffer zones may create a new greenhouse gases (GHG) source. We measured in situ nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in different parts of a spruce swamp buffer zone, N2O emissions from intact peat columns after fertilization with different ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) levels, and the rate and volume of in vivo N2O accumulation. N2O-producing micro-organisms existed throughout the buffer zone. The rate of N2O formation was highest at depths close to the prevailing water table within the buffer zone. Groundwater level and the vicinity of bypass water flows at the soil surface regulated the spatial and temporal variation in the rate of N2O efflux in the field. Nitrogen (N) addition rapidly increased in vivo N2O release. Microbial activity in the laboratory incubations under optimal conditions was high, but the in situ N2O efflux in the field was low. The actual leaching of mineral N from forestry areas was low and the inorganic N concentration in the buffer zone inflow was no higher than is typical for humic brooks or lakes in Finland. The low N2O fluxes indicated that forestry operations in the catchment did not result in significant N enrichment of the buffer zone. This study does not support the postulate that peatland buffer zones may become significant sources of N2O.

AB In the cool-temperate Bibi Mire, Hokkaido, Japan, valley fens and flood-plain fens have quite different vegetation. The main variables controlling the vegetation were all hydrological: mean water level, water level fluctuation and surface water flow. Chemical factors such as electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen and related pear decomposition were less important. The pH was about neutral and has little effect. The flood-plain fen developed under fluctuating water table conditions. The dominant species are Calamagrostis langsdorffii and Carex pseudocuraica. When temporal inundation occurs in the rainy or typhoon seasons, the submergence stimulates bud germination of the stoloniferous C. pseudocuraica, which can rapidly elongate its stolons upward. Some large floating peat mars occurred in the flood-plain fen zone. On these mats some Alnus japonica saplings establish and patches of alder forest can arise. Here the water level was higher than in the peripheral alder forest zone.
   The valley fen is dominated by Carex lasiocarpa var. occultans and/or C. limosa. It is formed under stable water table conditions in the inundated parts of the mire -where the non-inundated wet areas are dominated by alder trees. In the area where the surface water is flowing, these two fen sedges grow in deeper water since the high oxygen content is considered to compensate the flooding stress.

AB Seventeen peatland complexes were investigated in a 2000-ha study area in the Barnes Lake region of the west-central Wind River Range in Wyoming, U.S.A. Sites ranged in elevation from 2970 to 3200 m. The peatlands are generally less than 2 ha in size and are supported by groundwater flow systems. Seventeen plant community types are recognized using two-way indicator species analysis and Braun-Blanquet table methods, including 4 aquatic communities, 6 peatland expanse communities, and 7 peatland margin communities. Surface water in the study area is neutral to slightly acidic with very low cation concentrations. The water pH and flora indicate rich fen conditions, while the cation concentrations are more comparable to poor fens or even bogs. We propose calling the study area peatlands transitional rich fens, which are fed by mineral-poor water. The chemical composition of surface waters was found to be similar among different communities. Patterns of plant species and plant community distribution are a function of the water table depth and duration gradient and flow rates of the water supply. The rich-poor and peatland expanse - peatland margin gradients that reflect nutrient gradients do not appear to be important in the study area.

AB Groundwater discharge from an esker aquifer to a fen was studied to understand relevant hydrological processes for groundwater-surface water interaction in an esker-peatland hillslope. Piezometric levels of the peat layer and esker sand layer were continuously monitored and compared to climate data. Groundwater exfiltration points were spatially mapped and related to peat depth. The study showed a clear interaction between fen surface water and sand esker groundwater although the hydraulic conductivity of peat was low and the peat depth thick. In the artesian aquifer beneath the fen, the piezometric head showed a clear response to precipitation and evapotranspiration. Wetting of the peat is rapidly seen as pressure increase in the confined aquifer. This provides new information on hydraulics of wetlands found in aquifer discharge areas. Groundwater exfiltrated through thick peat layers in vertical preferential point discharges demonstrating how double porosity provides flow through the peat layer with low hydraulic conductivity in the peat matrix. The "pipe flow" channels were found in the deep peat area in the transition zones from deep peat to shallow peat. Diffuse seepage through the ditch bottom was found where ditches cut into the sand layer. Increased discharge through the ditch bed reduced the flow resistance at the aquifer boundary which can lower the groundwater level in the esker. The results show new processes in the groundwater discharge zone that are useful for groundwater modelling and policy development for future groundwater protection. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study examines the relationships between allogenic and autogenic processes during the Holocene development of a southern Quebec bog. Local vegetation, surface moisture and peat accumulation were independently reconstructed from palaeoecological data (microfossils, macrofossils, loss-on-ignition and radiocarbon dating) and sedimentological analyses conducted on seven profiles. The observed successional stages, from pond to marsh, rich fen, poor fen then bog, represents a typical hydrosere. The early wetland development provides an obvious illustration of the facilitation model: each community modified the hydrological conditions by means of peat accumulation which then favoured the onset of the succeeding stage. No direct link is evidenced between vegetation, moisture and peat accumulation, while all of them clearly reveal the initial influence of minerotrophic groundwater supply. Notably, the decrease in this allogenic influence is reflected by the increasing asynchrony of local vegetation change. The comparison of the seven profiles also shows several asynchronous moisture fluctuations at the peatland scale but none seems to be related to climate. In contrast, net peat accumulation shows similar trends in all marginal profiles and at the peatland scale. As a consequence of the initial minerotrophic supply, peat-accumulation rates were high during the early Holocene and low during the mid- and late Holocene. Our results, which show the major influence of groundwater and autogenic processes on peat accumulation, strongly contrast with the general climatic control recognized for European peatlands.

AB Total aboveground plant production in a bog, three rich fens and two marshes were determined via the multiple harvest and cranked wire techniques. These peatlands follow a gradient of increasing pH, water flow, and surface water nutrient concentrations from the bog to the rich fins to the eutrophic marshes. The net primary production (NPP) values were as follows: (i) bog, 390 g m(-2) year(-1), (ii) three rich fens (riverine sedge fen, lacustrine sedge fen, and floating sedge fen), 409 g m(-2) year(-1), 277 g m(-2) year(-1) and 356 g m(-2) year(-1), respectively, and (iii) one riverine and one lacustrine marsh, 323 g m(-2) year(-1) and 757 g m(-2) year(-1), respectively. Overall, the bog and the three fens had a similar NPP but they were significantly less productive than the marshes. Along this bog-fen-marsh gradient, moss and shrub production decreased and herb production increased. Herb and mass production exhibited a greater variation between years than among sites within each year. Shrub production remained similar during both years of this study. A significant tree stratum was only present in the bog. Generally, NPP was greater in 1994 than in 1993. Comparisons with other NPP data from bogs, fens, and marshes throughout North America showed that the results. of this study complement a latitudinal gradient of NPP for bogs. The latitudinal gradient for NPP in fens and marshes is less pronounced.

AB The vegetation of one of the largest spring mires in Poland has been studied with special regard to hydrological conditions and stratigraphic development of the mire. Despite its biotic richness the mire is in a slow state of deterioration, initiated by man several hundred years ago. Evidence has been found that drainage occurred in an originally treeless percolating mire (sloping fen), possibly as a result of hydrological changes in a lower lying lake.  The development of the springs was probably a reaction to the increased resistance to water flow in the percolating mire, forcing the groundwater to discharge high up at the sand borders. The eroding effect of the spring water courses increased the drainage and, although the springs also provided new habitats for rare moss communities, a considerable eutrophication in the present spring alder wood can be noticed.

AB Raised bogs are important ecohydrological systems in which there are strong two-way links between plant succession, litter and peat decay, and hydrological functioning. Using recently established protocols, we measured the hydraulic structure of a raised bog in West Wales. We tested two hypotheses: (i) that the hydraulic conductivity (K) of the peat shows depth dependency such that lower layers of peat are effectively impermeable, and (ii) that the K of the marginal peat of the bog dome is lower than that in central areas. From 107 piezometer measurements we found there was depth dependency of K but that lower peat layers were not poorly permeable or impermeable. We also found that the K of the peat on the margin of the bog dome was generally significantly lower than that in central areas. Our results Suggest that, for some bogs at least. it is important to simulate water flow through deeper peats when simulating peatland development or growth. They also raise the intriguing possibility that the low K of marginal peat is important in maintaining wet conditions in central bog areas, allowing bogs to reach greater thicknesses than they would do in the absence of the low-K margin; an idea first proposed for blanket bogs by Lapen et al. (2005). Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Six calcareous fens in the Minnesota River Basin, USA are in regional hydrogeologic settings with large discharges of calcareous ground water. These settings juxtapose topographically high areas of ground-water recharge with fens in lower areas of discharge, thus creating steep upward hydraulic gradients at the fens. Coarse glacial deposits with high permeability connect recharge areas to discharge areas and transmit large amounts of ground water to the fens. Calcareous fens in the Minnesota River Basin are associated with two regional landforms, river terraces and glacial moraines. The calcareous drift is the likely source of carbonate for the fens; carbonate bedrock is not required. Five of the calcareous fens form peat aprons over broad areas of diffuse ground-water discharge on river terraces. One of the calcareous fens is a peat dome over an aquifer window, a relatively small area (about 15-m radius) of localized ground-water discharge through a breach in the clayey confining layer of the underlying aquifer. Carbonate content of calcareous fen peat averaged about 27% (calcium carbonate equivalent, dry weight basis) in the surface layer, which commonly overlies a carbonate-depleted zone with a carbonate content of 10% or less. Hydraulic conductivity (K) of calcareous fen peat determined from slug tests ranged from 2.7 x 10(-7) to 9.8 x 10(-5) m s(-1) and had a geometric mean of 3.8 x 10(-6) m s(-1). These values likely underestimate the true horizontal hydraulic conductivity (K-h) and overestimate the true vertical hydraulic conductivity (K-v) because of errors in assumptions commonly used in slug-test analyses. Median (over time) hydraulic heads in wells screened below the base of the peat ranged from about 25 to 69 cm above the peat surface. Upward vertical gradients (dimensionless) through the peat ranged from 0.040 to 0.209. Vertical ground-water discharge was calculated by Darcy's Law and ranged from 2 to 172 L m(-2) d(-1). Because of bias in estimating K-v, these values likely overestimate the true vertical ground-water discharge and indicate the importance of better field methods to estimate K, especially K-v. Calcareous fens may need water tables sustained near the peat surface by large vertical ground-water discharges to allow carbonate precipitation, which is associated with the rare fen vegetation.

AB This study used a two-dimensional steady-state finite-element groundwater flow model to simulate groundwater flow in two Newfoundland blanket peat complexes and to examine flow system sensitivity to changes in water table recharge and aquifer properties. The modelling results were examined within the context of peat-forming processes in the two complexes. Modelled flow compared favourably with observed flow. The sensitivity analyses suggested that more highly decomposed bog peat along bog margins probably has/had a positive impact on net peat accumulation within bog interiors. Peat with lower hydraulic conductivity along bog margins effectively impedes lateral drainage, localizes water table drawdown to extreme bog margins, and elevates water tables along bog interiors. Peat formation and elevated water tables in adjacent poor fens/laggs currently rely on placic and ortstein horizons impeding vertical drainage and water flow inputs from adjacent bogs. Modest reductions in atmospheric recharge were found to govern bog-flow-system geometries in a way that would adversely affect paludification processes in adjacent fens/laggs.

AB The Carnian-Rhaetian Callide Coal Measures are preserved in a small (22.5 km by 8 km), partially fault-bounded basin remnant in east-central Queensland, Australia. The < 150 m thick coal-measure succession is interpreted to have accumulated during a phase of mild crustal extension that formed a series of discrete, intermontane basins in eastern Australia. The succession fines upward from a conglomerate-rich lower part into a finer-grained and coal-bearing upper section (including coal seams < 34 m thick), and is interpreted as the deposits of an alluvial-plain environment. Anomalous, matrix-rich diamictites, breccias, and conglomerates have been recognized within the succession at several localities, in many cases interbedded with coals. These are interpreted as the product of debris flows.
   Two debris-flow lithofacies are recognized: (1) mixtures of fine carbonaceous material, clay, silt, sand, gravel, and volcaniclastic debris, and (2) breccias consisting principally of coal clasts in a coaly matrix with minor elastic and volcaniclastic debris. Facies 1 is found in sharp-based, simple or composite bodies (< 15 m thick) that are elongate to lobate in plan (with some multi-lobate), and as much as at least 1500 m long and 600 m wide. Facies 2 is less common and occurs in sharp-based units as much as 1.5 m thick, at least 200 m in length, and 60 m in width. Both facies are characterized by abundant fine matrix and a very poorly sorted clast population, and show little internal organization or sedimentary structure other than variably developed imbrication of coarse clasts. Parts of some bodies show an erosional base (with up to several meters of coal removed), although a flat, apparently non-erosional contact is more common.
   The distribution of debris flows in the Callide Coal Measures shows a coincidence with mapped faults and interpreted structural lineaments, The debris flows may have been triggered by fault movements, which formed rupture topography on the flat alluvial plain, and caused destabilization of water-saturated elastic and organic sediments. Some debris-flow bodies may have been mounded, such that subsequent peat formation was restricted until those bodies were buried. The preservation of debris-how units at different stratigraphic levels along mapped structures suggests multiple paleoseismic events or multiple debris-how events along those structures, The mixing of volcaniclastic debris into debris-flow facies suggests that seismic events were coincident with (or perhaps caused by) nearby, explosive volcanic activity. The close relationship between debris-flow deposits and thick coal bodies on the inferred downthrown sides of faults at Callide further suggests that periodic, tectonic subsidence may have facilitated thick coal accumulation.

AB Water flows in peatland margins is an under-researched topic. This study examines recharge from a peatland to an esker aquifer in an aapa mire complex of northern Finland. Our objective was to study how the aapa mire margin is hydrogeologically connected to the riverside aquifer and spatial and temporal variations in the recharge of peatland water to groundwater (GW). Following geophysical studies and monitoring of the saturated zone, a GW model (MODFLOW) was used in combination with stable isotopes to quantify GW flow volumes and directions. Peatland water recharge to the sandy aquifer indicated a strong connection at the peatland-aquifer boundary. Recharge volumes from peatland to esker were high and rather constant (873 m (3) d (-1) ) and dominated esker recharge at the study site. The peat water recharging the esker boundary was rich in dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Stable isotope studies on water ( delta (18) O, delta (2) H, and d-excess) from GW wells verified the recharge of DOC-rich water from peatlands to mineral soil esker. Biogeochemical analysis revealed changes from DOC to dissolved inorganic carbon in the flow pathway from peatland margin to the river Kitinen. This study highlights the importance of careful investigation of aapa mire margin areas and their potential role in regional GW recharge patterns.

AB Groundwater flow patterns and geochemistry were studied in the Mer Bleue bog, near Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Groundwater flow patterns alternated between recharge, i.e. head gradients producing flow from the surface of the peatland to the deeper peat. and discharge, i.e. head gradients indicating flow from the deeper peat towards the surface of the peatland, during the summer of 1998. The patterns were controlled by changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration and the differential head response of catotelm peat (lower layer) to changes in water table elevation. Above-average rainfall in the spring created recharge patterns of groundwater flow in the peatland. Evapotranspiration exceeded precipitation for a three-week period in mid-summer decreasing head at the water table and reversing flow from recharge to discharge. A sustained moisture deficit maintained a flow reversal for 32 days, until a 46 mm rainfall raised the water-table, reversing the vertical hydraulic gradients and restoring recharge flow.
   The mixing of meteoric water and deeper groundwater controls geochemical profiles. Diffusion modeling shows that the peatland is a long-term recharge system. However, electrical conductivity and cation concentrations in peat pore-waters increase (up to 60%) during a flow reversal, and then decrease when recharge conditions are re-established. The redistribution of substrates from reversed flow is likely important to peatland biogeochemical function. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Relations between vegetation characteristics and eco-hydrological processes were assessed in a pristine mire in the valley of the Ob River (Western Siberia). Along a transect from the terrace scarp to the river, field data were collected on vegetation composition, peat stratigraphy, peat chemistry, hydrology and hydrochemistry. Based on floristic composition, eight vegetation communities were distinguished. Hydraulic head measurements were used to obtain an indication of groundwater flow directions. The water balance of the mire was calculated with a two-dimensional steady-state numerical groundwater model. Water types were defined based on cluster analysis of hydrochemical data. The results revealed that the dominant hydrological factor in the Ob mire is the discharge of groundwater, which supplies about threefold more water than net precipitation. Although the discharge flux decreases with increasing distance from the terrace scarp, high water levels and a "groundwater-like" mire water composition were observed in the major part of the study site. Precipitation and river water play only a minor role. Despite dilution of discharging groundwater with rainwater, spatial differences in pH and solute concentrations of the surficial mire water are small and not reflected in the vegetation composition. Although small amounts of silt and clay were found in the peat in the proximity of the river, indicating the occurrence of river floods in former times, no river-flood zone could be recognized based on hydrochemical characteristics or vegetation composition. A comparison of the Ob mire with well-studied and near-natural mires in the Biebrza River valley (Poland) revealed substantial differences in both vegetation characteristics and the intensity and spatial pattern of eco-hydrological processes. Differences in the origin and ratios of water fluxes as well as a dissimilar land use history would seem to be key factors explaining the differences observed.

AB Global peatlands are a valuable but vulnerable resource. They represent a significant carbon and energy reservoir and play major roles in water and biogeochemical cycles. Peat soils are highly complex porous media with distinct characteristic physical and hydraulic properties. Pore sizes in undecomposed peat can exceed 5 mm, but significant shrinkage occurs during dewatering, compression and decomposition, reducing pore-sizes. The structure of peat soil consists of pores that are open and connected, dead-ended or isolated. The resulting dual-porosity nature of peat soils affects water flow and solute migration, which influence reactive transport processes and biogeochemical functions. Advective movement of aqueous and colloidal species is restricted to the hydrologically active (or mobile) fraction of the total porosity, i.e. the open and connected pores. Peat may attenuate solute migration through molecular diffusion into the closed and dead-end pores, and for reactive species, also through sorption and degradation reactions. Slow, diffusion-limited solute exchanges between the mobile and immobile regions may give rise to pore-scale chemical gradients and heterogeneous distributions of microbial habitats and activity in peat soils. While new information on the diversity and functionalities of peat microbial communities is rapidly accumulating, the significance of the geochemical and geomicrobial study on peat stands to benefit from a basic understanding of the physical structure of peat soils. In this paper, we review the current knowledge of key physical and hydraulic properties related to the structure of globally available peat soils and briefly discuss their implications for water storage, flow and the migration of solutes. This paper is intended to narrow the gap between the ecohydrological and biogeochemical research communities working on peat soils. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The close interplay between hydraulic and biotic processes controls the evolution of ecosystems in large, circumboreal peatlands and the degree to which they lose, gain or sequester carbon. In peatlands, biota significantly alters surficial acid-base equilibrium and solute chemistry by releasing dissolved organic compounds into surface and pore waters, which then mix through advection and dispersion through pore water flow paths.
   We report herein the results of new geochemical mixing models that incorporates organic acid dissociation constants to understand how organic acids control the acid-base chemistry in mixtures of dilute acidic bog pore waters and circum-neutral groundwater (typical of carbonate terrains) that upwells or disperses into peat deposits.
   In our new mixing models, at least twice as much groundwater is required to neutralize bog water acidity when dissolved organic carbon concentrations exceed 10 mmol/L than in their absence. Although it remains uncertain how future climatic change will alter the composition of dissolved organic matter in peatlands, organic acids should remain an important factor with respect to potential neutralization of peatland waters by groundwater sources. The acid base equilibria in large peat basins not only has important implications for vegetation patterning but also for biogeochemical cycles in these globally important reservoirs for carbon.

AB Peatland environments provide important ecosystem services including water and carbon storage, nutrient processing and retention, and wildlife habitat. However, these systems and the services they provide have been degraded through historical anthropogenic agricultural conversion and dewatering practices. Effective wetland restoration requires incorporating site hydrology and understanding groundwater discharge spatial patterns. Groundwater discharge maintains wetland ecosystems by providing relatively stable hydrologic conditions, nutrient inputs, and thermal buffering important for ecological structure and function; however, a comprehensive site-specific evaluation is rarely feasible for such resource-constrained projects. An improved process-based understanding of groundwater discharge in peatlands may help guide ecological restoration design without the need for invasive methodologies and detailed sitespecific investigation.
   Here we examine a kettle-hole peatland in southeast Massachusetts historically modified for commercial cranberry farming. During the time of our investigation, a large process-based ecological restoration project was in the assessment and design phases. To gain insight into the drivers of site hydrology, we evaluated the spatial patterning of groundwater discharge and the subsurface structure of the peatland complex using heat-tracing methods and groundpenetrating radar. Our results illustrate that two groundwater discharge processes contribute to the peatland hydrologic system: diffuse lower-flux marginal matrix seepage and discrete higher-flux preferential-flow-path seepage. Both types of groundwater discharge develop through interactions with subsurface peatland basin structure, often where the basin slope is at a high angle to the regional groundwater gradient. These field observations indicate strong correlation between subsurface structures and surficial groundwater discharge. Understanding these general patterns may allow resource managers to more efficiently predict and locate groundwater seepage, confirm these using remote sensing technologies, and incorporate this information into restoration design for these critical ecosystems.

AB In 1966, tritiated water was injected at five sites at depths between 25 and 100 cm into blanket bog at Moor House National Nature Reserve. The distribution of tritium activity on a logarithmically spaced grid around these sites was sampled in 1990, 24 years after placement. The proportions of tritium accounted for ranged from 80 % for the injection at 100 cm deep, to 20 % for the injection at 25 cm deep. Both 80 and 20 should be considered as +/- 10 %. Results imply that diffusion close to the injection may have played a part in movement of tritium; evapotranspiration is not inconsistent with the losses inversely proportional to depth of placement; but the main process of movement is probably bulk (mass) flow of water through the peat.

AB Currently, little is known about the impact of climate change on groundwater recharge in the Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade Range of California or other mountainous regions of the world. The purpose of this study was to determine whether small alpine peatlands called fens can be used as whole-ecosystem gauges of groundwater recharge through time. Fens are sustained by groundwater discharge and are highly sensitive to changes in groundwater flow due to hydrologic disturbance including climate change. Seven fens in the Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade Range were studied over a 50-80 year period using historic aerial photography. In each aerial photograph, fen areas were identified as open lawn and partially treed areas that exhibited (1) dark brownish-green coloring or various shades of gray and black in black and white imagery and (2) mottling of colors and clustering of vegetation, which signified a distinct moss canopy with overlying clumped sedge vegetation. In addition to the aerial photography study, a climate analysis for the study sites was carried out using both measured data (U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service SNOwpack TELemetry system) and modeled data (a downscaled version of the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model) for the period from 1951 to 2010. Over the study period, the five fens in the Sierra Nevada were found to be decreasing between 10% and 16% in delineated area. The climate analysis revealed significant increases through time in annual mean minimum temperature (T-min) between 1951-1980 and 1981-2010. In addition, April 1 snow water equivalent and snowpack longevity also decreased between 1951-1980 and 1981-2010. For the fens in the Cascade Range, there were no discernible changes in delineated area. At these sites, increases in T-min occurred only within the past 20-25 years and decreases in snowpack longevity were more subtle. A conceptual model is presented, which illustrates that basic differences in hydrogeology of the Sierra Nevada vs. the Cascade Range may control the threshold at which changes in delineated fen areas are discernible. Overall, the results from this study show that fens in the Sierra Nevada have strong potential as whole-ecosystem gauges for determining long-term changes in groundwater recharge under climate change. Due to either more moderate climate change and/or hydrogeological differences, fens in the southern Cascade Range currently do not appear to have the same utility. A greater sample size of fens in the Sierra Nevada is needed to confirm the general applicability of this method. In addition, future work needs to focus on integrating fen monitoring with geochemical and/or isotopic process-level studies in order to quantify changes in groundwater recharge identified using this new approach.

AB Calcareous fens are species-rich peatlands thought to form at discrete alkaline groundwater discharge points. Here the spatial and temporal variability in the peat pore-water hydrodynamics at a fine (plot) scale of three calcareous fens in southern Ontario was investigated over three growing seasons to evaluate the sensitivity of these wetlands to weather fluctuation and landscape position. Only a small area of the fens demonstrated patterns of groundwater upwelling, and positive vertical hydraulic gradients (VHG) were low, peaking at 0.1. Local decreases in saturated hydraulic conductivity generated areas of pore-water over-pressuring in the peat profile through much of the fens. Several areas were subjected to large negative VHG (max = -0.2), causing sustained groundwater recharge. in this study the strength of the connection to the principal source area of water (alkaline stream) determined the pattern and variability of calcareous fen peat hydrodynamics amongst three growing seasons differing markedly in precipitation. The range of pore-water hydrodynamics evident in this study provides evidence for the processes controlling the sensitivity of calcareous fens to climate and land-use change. A conceptual model linking calcareous fen landscape position to weather- and climate-induced hydrodynamic variability is presented to guide management of these biodiverse ecosystems.

AB Ground water recharge is assumed to occur primarily at raised bog crests in northern peatlands, which are globally significant terrestrial carbon reservoirs. We synoptically surveyed vertical profiles of peat pore water delta O-18 and delta H-2 from a range of bog and fen landforms across the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands, northern Minnesota. Contrary to our expectations, we find that local-scale recharge penetrates to not only the basal peat at topographically high bog crests but also transitional Sphagnum lawns and low-lying fen water tracks. Surface landscape characteristics appear to control the isotopic composition of the deeper pore waters (depths >= 0.5m), which are partitioned into discrete ranges of delta O-18 on the basis of landform type (mean +/- standard deviation for bog crests = -11.9 +/- 0.4%, lawns = -10.6 +/- 0.1%, fenwater tracks= -8.8 +/- 1.0%). Fen water tracks have a shallow free-water surface that is seasonally enriched by isotope fractionating evaporation, fingerprinting recharge to underlying pore waters at depths >= 3m. Isotope mass balance calculations indicate on average 12% of the waters we sampled from the basal peat of the fen water tracks was lost to surface evaporation, which occurred prior to advection and dispersion into the underlying formation. These new data provide direct support for the hypothesis that methane production in deeper peat strata is fuelled by the downward transport of labile carbon substrates from the surface of northern peat basins.

DE artesian water; erosion; hydrology; peat domes
AB This article describes two spring mire complexes in the Kruger National Park (South Africa) that are fed by thermal water with a temperature of 37-42 degrees C. The mires are small (1-20 m in diameter). The peat thickness is 1-2.5 m, of which 1-1.5 m is elevated above the surroundings. Some of the domes have dried out severely and show signs of erosion due to water flow and trampling by large animals. The mires lie in an almost straight line, supporting the hypothesis that the water originates from deep aquifers which discharge at geological faults. The long-term existence of these spring mire complexes may not be threatened because young stages of mire formation are present, but research to elucidate the timescales of peat development is needed to make a valid prognosis.

   hydrologic regime; Late Weichselian/Holocene; Northern Russian Plain
AB The relicts of large meandering palaeochannels are found throughout the territory of the periglacial zone of the Last (Valdai=Weichselian) Glaciation on the Russian Plain. Channel widths of macro-meanders can be 15 times larger than the recent meanders of the same rivers. Palaeolandscape and palaeohydrological reconstructions show that these periglacial river channels were formed under conditions of high spring water flow, up to eight times greater than the modern discharges, when the flow coefficient was close to 0.9-1.0 due to presence of permafrost, summers were dry and streams lacked ground water supply. Permafrost degradation increased soil permeability in spring and increased ground water flow in summer, causing a decrease of annual flow (due mainly to the flood flow decrease in spring). As a result, large periglacial channels were abandoned and transformed into lakes and bogs. Late Holocene channels have much smaller channel widths and meander lengths. These were formed under conditions of lower annual flows and much steadier flow regime.

AB The mechanisms behind the plant litter mixture effect on decomposition are still difficult to disentangle. To tackle this issue, we used a model that specifically addresses the role of the litter moisture content. Our model predicts that when two litters interact in terms of water flow, the difference of evaporation rate between two litters can trigger a nonadditive mixture effect on decomposition. Water flows from the wettest to the driest litter, changing the reaction rates without changing the overall litter water content. The reaction rate of the litter receiving the water increases relatively more than the decrease in the reaction rate of the litter supplying the water, leading to a synergistic effect. Such water flow can keep the microbial biomass of both litter in a water content domain suitable to maintain decomposition activity. When applied to experimental data (Sphagnum rubellum and Molinia caerulea litters), the model is able to assess whether any nonadditive effect originates from water content variation alone or whether other factors have to be taken into account.

TI Hans Albert Einstein: Innovation and compromise in formulating sediment
   transport by rivers
SO JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper is written to mark the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Hans Albert Einstein (1904-1973). It casts his career as that of the archetypal researcher protagonist determined to master intellectually the way water flows and conveys alluvial sediment in rivers. In that effort, Einstein personified the mix of success and frustration experienced by many researchers who have attempted to formulate the complicated behavior of alluvial rivers in terms of mechanically based equations. His formulation of the relationship between rates of bed-sediment transport (especially bedload transport) and water flow comprised an innovative departure from the largely empirical approach that prevailed at the time. He introduced into that relationship the emerging fluid-mechanic concepts of turbulence and boundary layers, and concepts of probability theory. Inevitably the numerous complexities attending sediment transport mire formulation and prompt his use of several approximating compromises in order to make estimating bed-sediment transport practicable. His formulation nonetheless is a milestone in river engineering.

AB In the oil sands development region near Fort McMurray, Alberta, wetlands cover similar to 62 % of the landscape, and similar to 95 % of these wetlands are peatlands. A saline fen was studied as a reference site for peatland reclamation. Despite highly saline conditions, a freshwater bog was observed in the path of local saline groundwater flow. The purpose of this study was to identify the hydrological controls that have allowed the development and persistence of a bog in this setting. The presence of bog vegetation and its dilute water chemistry suggest that saline groundwater from the fen rarely enters the bog, which functions predominantly as a groundwater recharge system. Chloride (Cl-) and sodium (Na+) were the dominant ions in fen water, with concentrations averaging 5394 and 2307 mg L-1, respectively, while the concentrations in bog water were 5 and 4 mg L-1, respectively. These concentrations were reflected by salinity and electrical conductivity measurements, which in the fen averaged 9.3 ppt, and 15.8 mS cm(-1), respectively, and in the bog averaged 0.1 ppt and 0.3 mS cm(-1), respectively. A small ridge in the mineral substratum was found at the fen-bog margin, which created a persistent groundwater mound. Under the dry conditions experienced in early summer, groundwater flow was directed away from the bog at a rate of 14.6 mm day(-1). The convex water table at the fen-bog margin impeded flow of saline water into the bog and instead directed it around the bog margin. However, the groundwater mound was eliminated during flooding in autumn, when the horizontal hydraulic gradient across the margin became negligible, suggesting the possibility of saline water ingress into the bog under these conditions.

AB The understanding of succession from rich fen to poorer fen types requires knowledge of changes in hydrology, water composition, peat chemistry and peat accumulation in the successional process. Water flow patterns, water levels and water chemistry, mineralisation rates and nutrient concentrations in above-ground vegetation were studied along a extreme-rich fen - moderate-rich fen gradient at Biebrza (Poland). The extreme-rich fen was a temporary groundwater discharge area, while in the moderate-rich fen groundwater flows laterally towards the river. The moderate-rich fen has a rainwater lens in spring and significant lower concentrations of calcium and higher concentrations of phosphate in the surface water. Mineralisation rates for N, P and K were higher in the moderate-rich fen. Phosphorus concentrations in plant material of the moderate-rich fen were higher than in the extreme-rich fen, but concentrations of N and K in plant material did not differ between both fen types. Water level dynamics and macro-remains of superficial peat deposits were similar in both fen types.
   We concluded that the differences observed in the moderate-rich and the extreme-rich fens were caused by subtile differences in the proportion of water sources at the peat surface (rainwater and calcareous groundwater, respectively). Development of an extreme-rich fen into a moderate-rich fen was ascribed to recent changes in river hydrology possibly associated with a change in management practices. The observed differences in P-availability between the fen types did not result in significantly different biomass. Moreover, biomass production in both fen types was primarily N-limited although P-availability was restricted too in the extreme-rich fen. Aulacomnium palustre, the dominant moss in the moderate-rich fen, might be favoured in competition because of its broad nutrient tolerance and its quick establishment after disturbance. It might outcompete low productive rich fen species which were shown to be N-limited in both fens. We present a conceptual model of successional pathways of rich fen vegetation in the Biebrza region.

AB The SOIL and MACRO models with different versions of SOILN initially developed for small field-scales were used to simulate the water flow and nitrate N concentrations in two watersheds in Estonia that contain large areas of peat soils. Monitoring data show that nitrogen concentrations tend to increase in some rivers even where the human activity is very low. This may be connected to soil self-degradation processes taking place in drained peat soils where it is difficult to use most of the hydrological models. Results show that SOIL, MACRO and SOILN may be successfully applied at the watershed scale to model the water quantity and quality on watersheds with high content of peat soils. The analysis revealed that the nitrate nitrogen level trends depend considerably on the meteorological conditions.

AB Burial of organic matter in deep peat deposits has already been experimentally demostrated to slow down or even inhibit anaerobic decomposition due to lack of diffusive transport and end-product accumulation. However, so far little is known about potential biogeochemical or thermodynamic indicators for the observed inhibition of further decomposition. For example, theoretical energy yields for methanogenesis, hydrogen partial pressures, stable isotope fractionation factors between CO2 and CH4, and electrochemical properties of dissolved organic matter have been proposed as thermodyamic indicators for such inhibition. To test the applicability and explanatory power of these indicators to identify conditions inhibiting organic matter decomposition, we incubated homogenized ombrotrophic peat for 300 days at 20 degrees C under diffusive flux conditions as control, and compared the observed effects to a treatment with vertical advective transport by water circulation and to a treatment in which both the unsaturated and water-saturated zone of the peat profile were kept anoxic. Results of energy yields of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis were compared to hydrogen partial pressures, to C-13 isotope fractionation factors and to redox properties of dissolved organic matter as obtained from mediated electrochemical oxidation and reduction. While CO2 and CH4 production slowed substantially in the deep peat profile, a concomitant decrease of Gibs free energy yields available to hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogensis and hydrogen and acetate concentrations over time supported a thermodynamic constraint on methanogenesis. Although, energy yields for the hydrogenotrophic pathway were close to or below the theoretical energy minimum levels already after 15 days. Transiently elevated H-2 concentrations, not related to actual methanogenesis rates were observed for about 150-225 days. Thereafter, hydrogen concentrations diminished to levels below thresholds to thermodynamically support ongoing methanogenesis. Thus even on incubation timescales of 150-225 days, steady-state hydrogen concentrations as would be expected from thermodynamic considerations did not adjust on the bulk scale of observation. Gibbs free energy estimates for methanogenesis based on hydrogen partial pressures were consequently biased and did not reach the minimum required threshold despite ovious net CH4 production. Ratios between electron accepting (EAC) and donating (EDC) capacity of dissolved organic matter, however, turned out to provide suitable indicators of predominant redox conditions along gradients, stabilizing at low values upon onset of methanogenesis. Thus, our study demonstrated that the thermodynamically driven slow down of decomposition in deep peat deposits, preventing the peat to decompose further, cannot be easily identified based on a single indicator. However, constant and high concentrations of decomposition end-products, indicating zero net turnover and low energy yields, and constantly low EAC/EDC ratios, indicating no further availability of terminal electron acceptors, seem to be characteristic of the onset of conditions inhibiting further significant decomposition of peat.

AB Kiushitou (42degrees28' N, 141degrees9' E) is a lowland mire located in a residential area of northern Japan. We examined the 2-D distribution of hydrochemical variables and their seasonal changes in relation to plant communities in an attempt to conserve the Sphagnum fen (Sphagnum subfulvum ). This mire is gently sloping and the upper area consists of alder and ash forests, while the lower area is covered with fen communities. The grassy fen, Moliniopsis japonica , occurs throughout the lower area, whereas the Sphagnum fen is restricted to the southwest part of the mire. anova and canonical correspondence analysis revealed that the occurrence of Sphagnum fen is negatively correlated with Mg, Ca and electrical conductivity (EC). These variables indicated that water in the upper forest area contained a high concentration of minerals from the neighboring residential area. Seasonal changes in EC values revealed that the watercourse from a spring point in an upper corner to the lowest drainage ditch was divided into two, southwest and northeast, courses. Because the northeast-course spring water joins mineral-rich water flowing from a point at the upper margin, the northeast part of the lower area contains considerable Ca and Mg. In contrast, the mineral-poor spring water flowing into the southwest part of the mire ensures the survival of the Sphagnum fen. Thus, when we stop the supply of mineral-rich water from the upper margin the area of the Sphagnum fen will expand into the northeast part of the mire. Two-dimensional details of the hydrochemical regime clarify the impact of mineral inflow and the expansion mechanisms of these minerals.

SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Traditional estimates of soil and sediment phosphorus retention are based on orthophosphate (PO4) removal from water by soil or sediment columns under saturated water flow.  These techniques may not reflect the P uptake of in situ soils accurately because the PO4 concentration of through-flowing water is often below detection limits in nonpolluted wetlands during the growing season.  We used peat soils from the Florida Everglades in saturated flow and equilibrium sorption experiments to show that the uptake of PO4 reaches saturation quickly, potentially underestimating soil P binding capacity when compared with total phosphorus (TP) retention.  The rate of TP uptake was constant for 2 d, while the rate of PO4 uptake slowed and followed saturation kinetics.  The majority of the TP removed was associated with particles within a 1-20-mu-m size range.  Experiments using both NaCl and nonionic detergent (Triton X-100) as well as batch equilibrium sorption studies indicate that the primary mechanism for TP removal by these soils is not straining.  Removal of TP by these soils appears to involve abiotic mechanisms that include both hydrophobic and ionic interactions.

AB Mobilization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and related trace elements (TEs) from the frozen peat to surface waters in the permafrost zone is expected to enhance under ongoing permafrost thaw and active layer thickness (ALT) deepening in high-latitude regions. The interstitial soil solutions are efficient tracers of ongoing bio-geochemical processes in the critical zone and can help to decipher the intensity of carbon and metals migration from the soil to the rivers and further to the ocean. To this end, we collected, across a 640 km latitudinal transect of the sporadic to continuous permafrost zone of western Siberia peatlands, soil porewaters from 30 cm depth using suction cups and we analyzed DOC, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and 40 major elements and TEs in 0.45 mu m filtered fraction of 80 soil porewaters.
   Despite an expected decrease in the intensity of DOC and TE mobilization from the soil and vegetation litter to the interstitial fluids with the increase in the permafrost coverage and a decrease in the annual temperature and ALT, the DOC and many major and trace elements did not exhibit any distinct decrease in concentration along the latitudinal transect from 62.2 to 67.4 degrees N. The DOC demonstrated a maximum of concentration at 66 degrees N, on the border of the discontinuous/continuous permafrost zone, whereas the DOC concentration in peat soil solutions from the continuous permafrost zone was equal to or higher than that in the sporadic/discontinuous permafrost zone. Moreover, a number of major (Ca, Mg) and trace (Al, Ti, Sr, Ga, rare earth elements (REEs), Zr, Hf, Th) elements exhibited an increasing, not decreasing, northward concentration trend. We hypothesize that the effects of temperature and thickness of the ALT are of secondary importance relative to the leaching capacity of peat, which is in turn controlled by the water saturation of the peat core. The water residence time in peat pores also plays a role in enriching the fluids in some elements: the DOC, V, Cu, Pb, REEs, and Th were a factor of 1.5 to 2.0 higher in mounds relative to hollows. As such, it is possible that the time of reaction between the peat and downward infiltrating waters essentially controls the degree of peat porewater enrichments in DOC and other solutes. A 2 degrees northward shift in the position of the permafrost boundaries may bring about a factor of 1.3 +/- 0.2 decrease in Ca, Mg, Sr, Al, Fe, Ti, Mn, Ni, Co, V, Zr, Hf, Th, and REE porewater concentration in continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones, and a possible decrease in DOC, specific ultraviolet absorbency (SUVA), Ca, Mg, Fe, and Sr will not exceed 20% of their current values. The projected increase in ALT and vegetation density, northward migration of the permafrost boundary, or the change of hydrological regime is unlikely to modify chemical composition of peat porewater fluids larger than their natural variations within different micro-landscapes, i.e., within a factor of 2. The decrease in DOC and metal delivery to small rivers and lakes by peat soil leachate may also decrease the overall export of dissolved components from the continuous permafrost zone to the Arctic Ocean. This challenges the current paradigm on the increase in DOC export from the land to the ocean under climate warming in high latitudes.

AB In general, mires develop by autogenic succession from more groundwater-fed to more rainwater-fed. This study from a calcareous mire in the West Carpathians (Slovakia) describes a similar development in the Early Holocene, followed by a reverse development in the Middle and Late Holocene. Pollen, macrofossil and testate amoeba analyses show that the site started as a minerotrophic open fen woodland. After 10 700 cal a BP autogenic succession led to the accumulation of at least 1 m of Sphagnum fuscum peat. Around 9000 cal a BP, as climate could no longer sustain a stable water regime, the bog desiccated and a fire broke out. The fire removed part of the peat layer and as a consequence relative water levels rose, leading to the establishment of a wet minerotrophic swamp carr with Thelypteris palustris, Equisetum sp. and Alnus sp. with extremely slow peat accumulation. After 600 cal a BP, rapid peat accumulation with calcareous tufa formation resumed as a result of anthropogenic deforestation and hydrological changes in the catchment and resulting increased groundwater discharge. At present the mire still hosts a wealth of relict and endangered plant and animal species typical of calcareous fens and fen meadows. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The analysis of hydrogeological problems arising in bog watering by methods enabling the depth to groundwater table to be controlled was used to develop a method for estimating the efficiency of such control when data for directly solving groundwater flow problems are lacking. The effect of nonmonotone dependence of the rate of groundwater level rise on the hydraulic conductivity of peat underlain by high-permeability sand rocks is described. This effect is shown to be significant in assessing the potentialities of the operational control of groundwater level in bog massifs with this type of geological structure.

ID TIME-DOMAIN REFLECTOMETRY; NEWFOUNDLAND
AB Time domain reflectometry (TDR) was used to estimate soil water storage dynamics in several uncultivated blanket bogs and poor fens in southeastern Newfoundland during the summer growing season. The purpose of the research was to evaluate links between surface moisture conditions, evapotranspiration, and recharge processes in order to elucidate factors that govern blanket pear formation in the region. Water storage changes in the peat/Sphagnum above the water table (Delta SWS) were found to be important storage terms in daily water balance estimates. Daily mean Delta SWS values for bog and fen approximated -0.3 and -0.45 mm, respectively. It was also found that, i) fairly high peat water-holding capacities, ii) frequent atmospheric recharge, iii) atmospheric controls on evapotranspiration, and, iv) the transport of water into the unsaturated zone from the shallow water table via capillary and external wicking processes helped to preclude significant de-watering over the bulk of the peatland surfaces. Recharge via groundwater appears to be an important factor governing moisture conditions requisite for peat accrual and the growth of Sphagnum spp., especially in the fens.

AB (1) Two peat mounds have developed in the Lost River peatland of northern Minnesota. One has the chemical and physical properties of an extremely rich fen and the other has the properties of a raised bog. The two mounds are separated by a water track with poor-fen vegetation and chemistry.
   (2) The vegetation at Lost River can be divided into five noda that correspond to landform units: spring-fen channel, spring-fen forest, marginal swamp forest, water track, and raised bog. These vegetation types have well-defined ranges for pH and calcium concentration.
   (3) Ordinations of the vascular plant and bryophyte data indicate a close relationship between the vegetation and both moisture and chemical gradients. The link between vegetation and chemistry is also supported by plots of species richness vs. pH and calcium concentration in which the peak in species numbers occurs within the rich-fen range.
   (4) The chemistry of the surface waters at Lost River is largely determined by the mixing of alkaline groundwater with precipitation, because the entire peatland is located at least seasonally within a discharge zone for groundwater. Mixing models indicate that the amount of groundwater within the surface waters ranges from 50% in the spring-fen channels to 1% on the raised bog.
   (5) The development of the two peat mounds was reconstructed from peat cores collected near the crests of the spring-fen mound and raised bog. The raised bog developed over a depression, which was first filled in with fen peat before minerotrophic sphagna invaded the site around 2625 B.P. By 2200 B.P. all fen indicator species had disappeared and the site was dominated by assemblages similar to those in the present raised bog.
   (6) The spring-fen mound, however, developed over a rise in the mineral substrate, which was not covered by peat until 3000 B.P. The mound was quickly colonized by Sphagnum and no fen indicators appeared until 1160 B.P. At this time the bog vegetation was replaced by a sedge fen containing assemblages similar to the present spring-fen channel.
   (7) This sharp reversal from bog to fen under the spring-fen mound can best be explained by the discharge of alkaline groundwater at the peat surface in sufficient quantities to convert the bog vegetation to a spring-fen channel.

AB Measurements were made of the hydraulic conductivity (K) of peat around a natural soil pipe in a blanket bog. This is the first investigation of decimeter-scale variability in both vertical K and horizontal K in blanket peats, which were found to be higher than indicated by previous research. This information suggests that it may be appropriate to reconsider (I) the spatial sampling strategies employed to investigate subsurface flow in blanket peatlands, and (II) how field data are used to parameterize flow models. Critically, there was spatial structure in the heterogeneity, with a wedge of high-K peat directly above the pipe forming a hydrological conduit between near-surface peat and the perennially flowing pipe. There was also significantly greater horizontal K parallel to the pipe's orientation compared with horizontal K perpendicular to the pipe. Determinations of the triaxial anisotropy of K, undertaken for the first time in peat soils, revealed substantial directional variations in K. The K around the pipe-peat interface was investigated; however, sample length dependency of K for peat samples precluded the investigation of a hypothesized low-K skin around the pipe.

AB With climate warming, snowmelt and runoff will occur more frequently during winter months. For efficient removal of runoff loads, water pollution protection methods such as constructed wetlands must also function during winter runoff periods. This study evaluated the purification efficiency and function of constructed wetlands in treating peat extraction runoff in all seasons, using collected data on inflow and outflow concentrations and wetland properties from 14 treatment wetlands in Finland. The runoff water flows partly on top of the peat layer as surface flow and partly as horizontal subsurface flow. In three of these wetlands, seasonal ground frost depth was also observed in two winter periods. In winter, the surface peat in constructed wetlands was mostly frozen (0-42 cm depth) but in some parts of the wetland the water flowed as overland or near-surface flow. Chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) purification efficiency varied seasonally, with NH4-N purification efficiency being highest during the warm summer period and CODMn purification efficiency being lowest during summer and winter. For other water quality parameters (N-tot, P-tot, PO4-P, Fe, and SS), no influence of season was noted. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A hydrological investigation was conducted in a small headwater peatland located in the Experimental Lakes Area, north-western Ontario, Canada, to determine the subsurface and surface flow paths within the peatland, and between the peatland and an adjacent forested upland during baseflow and storm flow conditions. Distinct zones of groundwater recharge and discharge were observed within the peatland. These zones are similar to those found in much larger flow systems even though the peatland was only influenced by local groundwater flow. Groundwater emerging in seeps and flowing beneath the peatland sustained the surface wetness of the peatland and maintained a constant baseflow. The response of the peatland stream to summer rain events was controlled by peatland water table position when the basin was dry and antecedent moisture storage on the uplands when the basin was wet. The magnitude and timing of peak runoff during wet conditions were controlled by the degree of hydrological connectivity between the surrounding upland terrain and the peatland.

ID WATER STORAGE; SUBSIDENCE; SHRINKAGE; DYNAMICS; FLOW; DEFORMATION;
   BEHAVIOR
AB [ 1] Peatlands respond to natural hydrologic cycles of precipitation and evapotranspiration with reversible deformations due to variations of water content in both the unsaturated and saturated zone. This phenomenon results in short-term vertical displacements of the soil surface that superimpose to the irreversible long-term subsidence naturally occurring in drained cropped peatlands because of bio-oxidation of the organic matter. These processes cause changes in the peat structure, in particular, soil density and void ratio. The consequential changes in the hydrological parameters need to be incorporated in water flow dynamical models. In this paper, we present a new constitutive relationship for the soil shrinkage characteristic (SSC) in peats by describing the variation of porosity with moisture content. This model, based on simple physical considerations, is valid for both anisotropic and isotropic three-dimensional peat deformations. The capability of the proposed SSC to accurately describe the deformation dynamics has been assessed by comparison against a set of laboratory experimental results recently published. The constitutive relationship has been implemented into a Richards' equation - based numerical code and applied for the simulation of the peat soil dynamics as observed in a peatland south of the Venice Lagoon, Italy, in an ad hoc field experiment where the relevant parameters are continuously measured. The modeling results match well a large set of field data encompassing a period of more than 50 days and demonstrate that the proposed approach allows for a reliable reproduction of the soil vertical displacement dynamics as well as the hydrological behavior in terms of, for example, water flow, moisture content, and suction.

AB The peat and pore-water biogeochemistry of an Irish oceanic raised bog are reported with a view to understanding the origin and development of a minerotrophic soak contained within an ombrotrophic bog. Depth profiles of electrical conductivity, pore-water chemistry and peat chemistry were recorded from the mire surface down to a maximum depth of 10 m (approximately 1 m into the underlying mineral soil) from the centre of Lough Roe, a minerotrophic soak on Clara Bog in the Irish midlands, and from a location in the surrounding bog. Distinct differences in the hydrochemistry and peat chemistry between both sites are evident in the upper 5 m of the profile, indicating that conditions differed during the latter development of the mire, despite both sites being located on the apex of the raised bog dome. As expected, the profiles recorded from the ombrotrophic bog are characterised by low ionic concentrations in the upper bog peat with an increase in the concentration of calcium and other ions in the lower fen peat (from 5.5 m depth). At the Lough Roe site, the profile shows relatively high concentrations of calcium and other ions in the upper part of the profile. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such detailed minerotrophic chemical profiles from the central area of a raised bog dome. We hypothesize that the relevant minerals originate from the underlying clay layer and fen peat within the basin of the bog and the minerals prevailed within the soak because of (1) the generation of a flow of water from the developing bog through the minerotrophic fen peat towards the soak during its early development, and (2) increased rates of decomposition within the soak throughout its existence. The implications for the future conservation management of the site are discussed.

AB Cushion plant dominated peatlands are key ecosystems in tropical alpine regions of the Andes in South America. The cushion plants have formed peat bodies over thousands of years that fill many valley bottoms, and the forage produced by the plants is critical for native and nonnative domesticated mammals. The sources and flow paths of water supporting these peatlands remain largely unknown. Some studies have suggested that glacier meltwater streams support some peatlands, and that the ongoing loss of glaciers and their meltwaters could lead to the loss or diminishment of peatlands. We analysed the hydrologic regime of 10 peatlands in four mountain regions of Bolivia and Peru using groundwater monitoring. Groundwater levels in peatlands were relatively stable and within 20 cm of the ground surface during the rainy season, and many sites had water tables 40-90 cm below the ground surface in the dry season. Topographic and groundwater elevations in the peatlands demonstrated that the water source of all 10 peatlands was hillslope groundwater flowing from lateral moraines, talus, colluvium, or bedrock aquifers into the peatlands. There was little to no input from streams, whether derived from glacier melt or other sources, and glacier melt could not have recharged the hillslope aquifers supporting peatlands. We measured the stable water isotopes in water samples taken during different seasons, distributed throughout the catchments, and the values are consistent with this interpretation. Our findings indicate that peatlands in the study region are recharged by hillslope groundwater discharge rather than stream water and may not be as vulnerable to glacial decline as other studies have indicated. However, both glaciers and peatlands are susceptible to changing thermal and precipitation regimes that could affect the persistence of peatlands.

AB 1 A general model of peatland dynamics is presented that emphasizes the interaction between water table depth and peat production. The model consists of two coupled, non-linear differential equations representing change in depth of peat and depth to the water table. Several simplified models are also considered to show the logical development of this model from previously published ones. The model provides an integrated view of how peatlands function over long time scales, by focusing on the non-linear interactions among peat production, decomposition and hydrology.
   2 Analysis of the model shows that equilibrium peat accumulation and water table depth depend on the net water input to the peatland. In drier sites, peatlands with relatively deep water tables develop and the equilibrium peat depth increases with increasing water input. In very wet conditions, peatlands have water tables near the surface, peat accumulation is limited by low production rates, and equilibrium peat depth is lower than is possible in comparatively drier sites. Over a range of intermediate water balances, there are two simultaneous equilibrium states where deep, dry peatlands and shallower, wet peatlands can both occur. This sensitivity to water balance suggests that small changes in precipitation regime, such as are expected with climate variability and change, could rapidly convert peatlands that are now in equilibrium into either sources or sinks of carbon.

AB A numerical model has been developed to simulate the spatiotemporal patterning of the ridge and slough landscape in wetlands, characterized by crests (ridges) and valleys (sloughs) that are elongated parallel to the direction of water flow. The model formulation consists of governing equations for integrated surface water and groundwater flow, sediment transport, and soil accretion, as well as litter production by vegetation growth. The model simulations show how the spatial pattern self-organizes over time with the generation of ridges and sloughs through sediment deposition and erosion driven by the water flow field. The spatial and temporal distributions of the water depth, flow rates and sediment transport processes are caused by differential flow due to vegetation and topography heterogeneities. The model was parameterized with values that are representative of the Everglades wetland in the southern portion of the Florida peninsula in the USA. Model simulation sensitivity was tested with respect to numerical grid size, lateral vegetation growth and the rate of litter production. The characteristic wavelengths of the pattern in the directions along and perpendicular to flow that are simulated with this model develop over time into ridge and slough shapes that resemble field observations. Also, the simulated elevation differences between the ridges and sloughs are of the same order of those typically found in the field. The width of ridges and sloughs was found to be controlled by a lateral vegetation growth distance parameter in a simplified formulation of vegetation growth, which complements earlier modeling results in which a differential peat accretion mechanism alone did not reproduce observations of ridge and slough lateral wavelengths. The results of this work suggest that ridge and slough patterning occurs as a result of vegetation's ability to grow laterally, enhancing sediment deposition in ridge areas, balanced by increased sediment erosion in slough areas to satisfy flow continuity. The interplay between sediment transport, water flow and vegetation and soil dynamic processes needs to be explored further through detailed field experiments, using a model formulation such as the one developed in this work to guide data collection and interpretation. This should be one of the focus areas of future investigations of pattern formation and stability in ridge and slough areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the effects of ditch blocking on fluvial carbon concentrations and fluxes at a 5-year, replicated, control-intervention field experiment on a blanket peatland in North Wales, UK. The site was hydrologically instrumented, and run-off via open and blocked ditches was analysed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon, dissolved carbon dioxide, and dissolved methane. DOC was also analysed in peat porewater and overland flow. The hillslope experiment was embedded within a paired control-intervention catchment study, with 3years of preblocking and 6years of postblocking data. Results from the hillslope showed large reductions in discharge via blocked ditches, with water partly redirected into hillslope surface and subsurface flows, and partly into remaining open ditches. We observed no impacts of ditch blocking on DOC, particulate organic carbon, dissolved carbon dioxide or methane in ditch waters, DOC in porewaters or overland flow, or stream water DOC at the paired catchment scale. Similar DOC concentrations in ditch water, overland flow, and porewater suggest that diverting flow from the ditch network to surface or subsurface flow had a limited impact on concentrations or fluxes of DOC entering the stream network. The subdued response of fluvial carbon to ditch blocking in our study may be attributable to the relatively low susceptibility of blanket peatlands to drainage, or to physical alterations of the peat since drainage. We conclude that ditch blocking cannot be always be expected to deliver reductions in fluvial carbon loss, or improvements in the quality of drinking water supplies.

AB Sphagnum bogs that were monitored over a 15-yr period showed significant changes in the abundance of diagnostic species. At plots ungrazed by cattle, the major bog species Sphagnum cristatum, Caltha introloba, and Carex gaudichaudiana increased significantly in cover. No such increases occurred in grazed plots. There were few changes in cover of the main structural vegetation types-closed heathland, low open heathland, and open herbfield on stony pavements. Sphagnum and the main herbfield species, Oreobolus pumilio and Caltha introloba, were dislodged and shifted over unvegetated stony pavements by snowmelt runoff, snowpack movement, and cattle trampling. Experiments using Sphagnum transplants showed this species capable of colonizing pavements by establishing on other plants. Survival and growth of transplants were significantly greater on low compared with high water flow (high energy) sites. Grazing and trampling by cattle significantly reduced survival of transplants. thus disrupting the colonization of pavements; firstly, by directly reducing the survival and growth of Sphagnum and other colonists; and secondly, by preventing the formation of barriers to water flow that would facilitate colonization. We propose a successional dynamic based on some of the processes operating in the open herbfield and stony pavements of Sphagnum bogs.

AB Northern peatlands are a vital component of the global carbon cycle, containing large stores of soil organic carbon and acting as a long-term carbon sink. Moss productivity is an important factor in determining whether these wetlands will retain this function under future climatic conditions. Research on unsaturated water flow in peatlands, which controls moss productivity during periods of evaporative stress, has focused on relatively deep bog systems. However, shallower peatlands and marginal connective wetlands can be essential components of many landscape mosaics. In order to better understand factors influencing moss productivity, water balance simulations using HYDRUS-1D were run for different soil profile depths, compositions, and antecedent moisture conditions. Our results demonstrate a bimodal distribution of peatland realizations, either primarily conserving water by limiting evapotranspiration or maximizing moss productivity. For sustained periods of evaporative stress, both deep water storage and a shallow initial water table delay the onset of high vegetative stress, thus maximizing moss productivity. A total depth of sand and peat of 0.8m is identified as the threshold above which increasing peat depth has no effect on changing vegetative stress response. In contrast, wetlands with shallow peat deposits (less than 0.5m thick) are least able to buffer prolonged periods of evaporation due to limited labile water storage and will thus quickly experience vegetative stress and so limit evaporation and conserve water. With a predicted increase in the frequency and size of rain events in continental North America, the moss productivity of shallow wetland systems may increase, but also greater moisture availability will increase the likelihood they remain as wetlands in a changing climate.

The wetland has a 'rich' side that contains wetland vegetation associated with solute-rich, near-neutral pH (minerotrophic) water, and a 'poor' side containing vegetation that grows in solute-poor and acidic (ombrotrophic) water. Vertical head gradients at piezometer clusters located in the rich side clearly show that groundwater is moving upwards towards the land surface, consistent with the vegetation types and surface water quality. In contrast, vertical head gradients also show that groundwater is moving upward in the poor side even though the vegetation and surface water chemistry are not minerotrophic. An incipient raised bog in the center of the poor side is the only site where groundwater moves consistently downward.
   A peat core collected at the bog center shows that the bog site was initially covered by minerotrophic vegetation, typically found in groundwater discharge zones, which was later replaced by ombrotrophic bog vegetation. Theoretical computer simulation experiments of the bog hydrogeologic setting through time suggest that the direction of vertical groundwater flow at the bog site permanently changed from up to down when a water table mound developed under a convex-shaped fen peat mound that probably formed because of differential peat accumulation. Ombrotrophic conditions and bog vegetation probably began when the fen water table mound grew sufficiently large enough to divert the upward movement of regional groundwater. The transition from rich to poor environments probably occurred when the wetland water table was substantially below the elevation of the surrounding regional water table.

AB Porewater chemistry is an integrative measure of the physical, chemical, and biological processes occurring within peatland ecosystems, and therefore some chemistry measures (e.g., pH, calcium concentrations) have been used to classify bog vs fen peatlands. However, porewater sampling is often limited in spatial and temporal resolution, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive analysis of spatiotemporal variation in porewater chemistry. We examined depth profiles of porewater chemistry in four nearby peatlands that fall along a bog to rich fen gradient in northcentral Minnesota, USA. Porewater was sampled similar to monthly during one ice-free season from three replicate piezometer nests per peatland to quantify temporal and spatial variability of those depth profiles. Porewater depth profiles of pH, calcium and total organic carbon concentrations, and delta O-18-H2O varied along the bog to fen gradient, but total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations did not. Porewater chemistry was similar in the bogs and poor fen which were all quite different from the rich fen. In contrast, temporal and spatial variation in porewater chemistry, quantified using coefficients of variation, did not differ between bogs and fens despite the hypothesis that variation in porewater chemistry would be lower in fens than bogs due to the perennial throughput of large volumes of discharging groundwater in the rich fen. Spatial and temporal variability in porewater chemistry across all peatland types highlights the importance of collecting porewater samples in multiples over time in both near-surface and deeper peats. This variation can be important when scaling findings to the peatland scale, assessing the representativeness of peatlands within a larger landscape, and understanding variability in solute export to downstream ecosystems.

AB Peatlands and associated ecosystem services are sensitive to climate changes and anthropogenic pressures such as drainage. This study illustrates these effects on the Forbonnet bog (7 ha), belonging to the Frasne peatland complex (similar to 300 ha, French Jura Mountain), and shows how they can inform about the ecohydrological functioning of peatlands. The southern part of the Forbonnet bog was restored in 2015-2016 by backfilling of artificial drains dating from the end of the 19th century. Piezometric data from 2014 to 2018 allow to evaluate the restoration effect on the water table depth (WTD) and highlight the reactivation of lateral inflows from the surrounding raised peatland complex. Vertical electrical conductivity (EC) profiles permit to identify three main peat compartments depending on different water supplies arguing for a nested hydrological functioning. This involves (1) one-off karst groundwater inputs at the substratum/peat interface supplying the deepest peat layer, (2) lateral seepage inputs from the neighbouring raised wooded peatlands sustaining the intermediate peat level and (3) direct rainfall infiltrating the most superficial peat layer. This nested multi-reservoir model operates at various spatio-temporal scales and is consistent with the complex seasonal hydrological and physico-chemical response at the bog outlet, which will be increasingly affected by climate change in the coming decades.

AB Investigation into the effects of beaver darns on hyporheic fluxes in channelled peatlands is needed to better understand how biological processes drive stream-riparian area connections and thus nutrient export, and to improve our overall conceptual model of water storage and flow through peatlands. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of beaver dams on vertical and lateral hyporheic exchange. Hydrometric methods were used to determine subsurface flow pathways and estimate hyporheic water fluxes for a third-order stream draining a Canadian Rocky Mountain peatland in 2006 and 2007. Three sites were studied two contained small, in-channel beaver darns and the third was a control. Vertical hyporheic fluxes equaled or exceeded lateral hyporheic fluxes despite the fact that hydraulic conductivity of the stream bed tended to be lower than the banks, suggesting peat hydraulic properties were not the dominant factor in the development of hyporheic exchange in stream systems draining peatlands as has been reported for streams underlain by mineral substrates. Instead, vertical fluxes were partially influenced by the presence of a mineral lens similar to 0.65 in below the ground surface. As well, high riparian water tables in relation to stream stage were key to limiting lateral fluxes. Steep hydraulic gradients above the two darns created looping flow pathways beneath and around them. However, little water actually flowed along these pathways. Measures of larger fluxes of water to the riparian area above the dams than those returning to the stream below the darns suggests either that hyporheic flow paths are longer than those measured in other studies or that the beaver dams generated recharge to the groundwater flow system.

AB Nutrient loading is a subtle, yet serious threat to the preservation of high diversity wetlands such as peatlands. Pathways of nutrient loading and impacts on plant diversity in a small peatland in New York State, USA were determined by collecting and analyzing a suite of hydrogeological, hydro-chemical, soil, and vegetation data. Piezometer clusters within an intensive network constituted hydro-chemical sampling points and focal points for randomly selected vegetation quadrats and soil-coring locations. Hydrogeological data and nutrient analyses showed that P and K loading occurred chiefly by means of overland flow from an adjacent farm field, whereas N loading occurred predominantly through ground-water flow from the farm field. Redundancy analysis and polynomial regression showed that nutrients, particularly total P in peat, total K in peat, extractable NH4-N, and NO3-N flux in ground water, were strongly negatively correlated with plant diversity measures at the site. No other environmental variables except vegetation measures associated with eutrophication demonstrated such a strong relationship with plant diversity. Nitrate loading over 4 mg m(-2) day(-1) was associated with low plant diversity, and Ca fluxes between 80 and 130 mg m(-2) day(-1) were associated with high plant diversity. Areas in the site with particularly low vascular plant and bryophyte species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity (H') occurred adjacent to the farm field and near a hillside spring. High H' and species richness of vascular plants and bryophytes occurred in areas that were further removed from agriculture, contained no highly dominant vegetation, and were situated directly along the ground-water flow paths of springs. These areas were characterized by relatively constant water levels and consistent, yet moderate fluxes of base cations and nutrients. Overall, this study demonstrates that knowledge of site hydrogeology is crucial for determining potential pathways of nutrient loading and for developing relationships between nutrient inflows and wetland plant diversity.

AB Model validation experiments are fundamental to ensure that the peat growth models correspond with the diversity in nature. We evaluated the Holocene Peatland Model (HPM) simulation against the field observations from a chronosequence of peatlands and peat core data. The ongoing primary peatland formation on the isostatically rising coast of Finland offered us an exceptional opportunity to study the peatland succession along a spatial continuum and to compare it with the past succession revealed by vertical peat sequences. The current vegetation assemblages, from the seashore to a 3000 year old bog, formed a continuum from minerotrophic to ombrotrophic plant communities. A similar sequence of plant communities was found in the palaeovegetation. The distribution of plant functional types was related to peat thickness and water-table depth (WTD) supporting the assumptions in HPM, though there were some differences between the field data and HPM. Palaeobotanical evidence from the oldest site showed a rapid fen-bog transition, indicated by a coincidental decrease in minerotrophic plant functional types and an increase in ombrotrophic plant functional types. The long-term mean rate of carbon (C) accumulation varied from 2 to 34 g C/m(2) per yr, being highest in the intermediate age cohorts. Mean nitrogen (N) accumulation varied from 0.1 to 3.9 g N/m(2) per yr being highest in the youngest sites. WTD was the deepest in the oldest sites and its variation there was temporally the least but spatially the highest. Evaluation of the HPM simulations against the field observations indicated that HPM reasonably well simulates peatland development, except for very young peatlands.

AB Mire pools - permanently water-filled depressions on peatlands - provide important habitats for myriad organisms. Recently, water balance change and eutrophication resulting from agricultural development are increasingly evident in mire pools of alluvial lowlands. Conservation of mire pool hydrochemistry is necessary. We investigated the hydrological and chemical budgets of a pristine mire pool, Akanuma Pool (95,280 m(2) area; 1.8 m mean depth), located in Kushiro Mire in Hokkaido, northern Japan, during its ice-free period (April-November) in 2007-2008. Thereby we elucidated the hydrochemical characteristics of mire pools formed on alluvial lowlands. Surface water inflow and surface water outflow dominated the hydrological budget, respectively representing 18.3 and 20.2 mm day(-1). Groundwater seepage through the pool bottom and surface water inflow mainly supplied the lake water with total nitrogen and Ca(2+). Total phosphorus was supplied mostly by groundwater seepage through the bottom. These chemical constituents were run off from the pool mostly by surface water outflow. The input and output fluxes of water were 16-20 times greater than those of North American mire pools because of Hokkaido's higher values of precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P-En. Moreover, the Ca(2+) input into the Akanuma Pool was several times greater than those reported from North American studies. Alluvial mineral soil under the peat layer supplied large amounts of nutrients and mineral ions including Ca(2+). These results demonstrate that Hokkaido mire pools' hydrochemical characteristics differ greatly from those of pools in North America. Furthermore, each hydrological budget component maintained a constant fraction throughout the two year study period, although the absolute flow rate varied concomitantly with the precipitation level. Maintaining this budget stability is important for the conservation of mire pool hydrochemistry. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results show that Baltic Bog first developed similar to 9600 cal a BP as a minerotrophic peatland (fen) dominated by Cyperaceae. At 8200 cal a BP, the fen transitioned into a peat bog dominated by Sphagnum. Between 8200 and 4000 cal a BP, water table depth (WTD) was generally low and the bog surface supported trees such as Picea mariana. From 4000 to 1700 cal a BP, WTD rose and the bog became more open. The macrocharcoal results show that the period similar to 2000-1000 cal a BP was characterized by several fire events that may have occurred on the bog surface at the core site. The results presented in this paper correspond closely with previous fossil pollen research done at Baltic Bog and suggest that regional climate change was a key factor in controlling long-term WTD variability and vegetation change at the site.

AB We conducted a multi-year study in two boreal peatlands to determine the impacts of resource access roads on methane (CH4) emission from adjacent peatland. Data were collected from transects aligned perpendicular to, and on both sides of two roads, one cutting through a bog and one cutting through a fen and from reference areas at each peatland. During the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017, we measured CH4 flux, water table, and peat temperature every second week. At the bog, the road associated impacts (changes to water table, peat temperature, and vegetation cover) were visible up to 20 m on both sides of the road (disturbed areas) with CH4 emission from disturbed areas being significantly higher compared to the reference areas in both years. There were no significant differences in CH4 emissions from disturbed areas compared to reference areas at the fen due to the limited hydrologic impact of the road crossing at this site. Bog plots located upstream of the road on transects located at >20 m from culverts and closer to the road emitted significantly more CH4 (124.6-mg CH4.m(-2).day(-1)) than other disturbed (10.2 mg CH4.m(-2).day(-1)) and reference areas (0.7-mg CH4.m(-2).day(-1)) due to shallower water table and warmer peat temperature. The road induced CH4 emissions (90.8 and 212.2 kg CH4/year for each kilometer of road, in 2016 and 2017, respectively) indicated that road construction across peatlands enhances CH4 emissions from these ecosystems, creating an additional source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas.
   Plain Language Summary Construction of resource access roads is common across the boreal region of Canada, and significant numbers of these roads are passing through peatlands. Peatlands are natural sources of methane, which is one of the important greenhouse gases. To determine the impacts of resource access roads on methane emission from the adjacent peatland, we conducted a study in two boreal forested peatlands (a bog and a fen). Our results showed that, at the bog, methane emission from disturbed areas were significantly higher compared to the reference areas. Similarly, the changes to the water table, peat temperature, and vegetation cover were visible up to 20 m on both sides of the road. In contrast, we did not find differences in methane emissions from disturbed areas compared to reference areas at the fen due to the limited hydrologic impact of the road crossing at this site. The increased methane emission from road adjacent areas indicates that road construction across peatlands enhances methane emissions from these ecosystems, creating an additional source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas. However, our study showed that aligning roads parallel to water flow when and where possible, and adequate culvert placement can help to minimize induced methane emissions.

ID DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; PORE-WATER; RELEASE; WETLANDS; COLUMNS; FLOW
AB Coastal peatlands represent an interface between marine and terrestrial ecosystems; their hydrology is affected by salt and fresh water inflow alike. Previous studies on bog peat have shown that pore water salinity can have an impact on the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) of peat because of chemical pore dilation effects. In this study, we aimed at quantifying the impact of higher salinities (up to 3.5% NaCl) on K-s of fen peat. Two experiments employing a constant-head upward-flow permeameter and differing in measurement and salinity change duration were conducted. Additionally, a third experiment to determine the impact of water salinity on the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of the studied peat type was carried out. The results show a decrease of K-s with time, which does not depend on the water salinity but is differently shaped for different peat types. We assume pore clogging due to a conglomerate of physical, chemical, and biological processes, which rather depend on water movement rate and time than on water salinity. However, an increased water salinity did increase the DOC release. We conclude that salinity-dependent behaviour of K-s is a function of peat chemistry and that for some peat types, salinity may only affect the DOC release without having a pronounced impact on water flow.

AB In many modelling studies on N cycling, denitrification is considered by a simplified process model. A widely used model describes denittification as potential denitrification reduced by the soil conditions nitrate N content (N), degree of water saturation (S) and temperature (7). Henault and Germon, 2000 [Henault, C. and Germon, J.C., 2000. NEMIS, a predictive model of denittification on the field scale. Eur. J. Soil Sci., 51: 257-270.] showed that this model worked satisfactorily for two data sets where parameters had been specifically derived for these data sets. This paper demonstrates that it may not always work well for other data, i.e., Dutch data sets. The model was parameterized for each of eight Dutch data sets, consisting of three sand, two heavy loam and three peat sites. After parameter optimisation the model is not able to predict individually measured actual denitrification rates. However, for sand and loam soils, but not for peat soils, the correspondence between measured and predicted average actual denitrification is good. This means that the calibrated model can predict, for those specific locations, cumulative denitrification rather well, provided that detailed information on soil conditions is available, either from measurements or from simulation models. The parameters and thus the reduction functions differed between the data sets. Parameter values within a class of soils, say sand, loam, and peat, were different. So care should be taken when using parameter values obtained from other studies. Albeit simple in its mathematical formulation, a widely used simplified denitrification process model needs to be parameterized for each location.
   The parameter optimisation is likely to be influenced by errors in the data. Therefore, an analysis on the effect of errors is presented based on an artificial data set. This data set was constructed consisting of 100 realisations of the soil conditions N, S and T, each drawn from a (log-)normal distribution based on the mineral Dutch data sets. For each realisation the relative denitrification rate (D-r) was computed based on a 'true' set of parameters. Next, measurement errors were introduced on D, N, S and T, either from a uniform or a normal distribution. For each of the 100 data sets the data were perturbed 100 times with newly drawn measurement errors. The perturbed data sets (10,000) were then optimised by the model. The coefficients of variation belonging to the estimates were large. This exercise can only be used to demonstrate possible directions of effects from errors, but it cannot be used to fully judge results obtained from real data sets. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Knowledge of the hydrological mechanisms behind habitat fragmentation of fen plant communities in intensively managed regions like The Netherlands is essential to improve currently utilized fen restoration and conservation strategies. In this study, we analysed the local and regional impact of anthropogenic drainage on the groundwater supply of fens. For this purpose, we developed fine-scale groundwater flow models and collected empirical data to analyse (1) the differences in groundwater supply between an anthropogenically drained fen and a poorly drained fen in The Netherlands, and (2) the local and regional effects of the elimination of drainage ditches on the groundwater supply of fens. Our results consistently indicated the presence of recently infiltrated precipitation on top of upwelling groundwater across the anthropogenically drained fen, and a mixing gradient of recently infiltrated precipitation and upwelling groundwater across the poorly drained fen. Furthermore, our results showed that the elimination of drainage ditches from the anthropogenically drained fen increased the area and the flux of groundwater supply of both the anthropogenically drained fen and the poorly drained fen. We conclude that anthropogenic drainage not only causes a lowering of groundwater tables, but also (1) enhances the infiltration of local precipitation across fens while simultaneously preventing upwelling groundwater from entering the fen root zone, and (2) reduces the groundwater supply of adjacent fens by intercepting groundwater that is potentially directed to downstream regions. These insights support the need to reconsider the current priorities in hydrological fen restoration strategies.

ID METHYLMERCURY; WATERS
AB The concentration of Hg was studied in runoff from drained and undrained peatlands in the south and central parts of Sweden, from 1987 to 1989.  Mercury was speciated into total Hg, water-soluble Hg (Hg II) including reactive Hg (Hg IIa) and non-reactive Hg (Hg IIb), and methyl Hg.  The aim of the study was to investigate if normally low concentrations of different species of Hg in runoff from peatland were elevated at drained mires with peat-harvesting.  Five drained mires with different nutrient statuses were studied, and compared with undrained controls.  The highest concentration of total Hg (5.3 to 21.3 ng L-1) was found in runoff from an undrained, oligotrophic bog with low pH (3.79 to 4.08).  Mires in south Sweden showed in general higher concentrations of all species of Hg in runoff compared to central Sweden.  The concentrations of total Hg, Hg IIa and Hg IIb in runoff from peatland showed similar levels as runoff from forested areas.  No data showed that the drained peatland leached more total Hg than the undrained areas.
   The determination of Me Hg during one year indicated higher mean concentrations (0.40 to 0.43 ng L-1) in runoff from two drained mires in south Sweden compared to the control in the same area (0.23 ng L-1) and all the studied mires in the central part of Sweden (0.10 to 0.24 ng L-1).  No obvious seasonal patterns or correlations with other determined elements were found, but the highest concentrations of all species of Hg in runoff normally occurred after dry periods with a low ground water table and low or moderate water flow.

AB The advances and retreats of ice sheets during Pleistocene significantly changed high- and mid-latitude landscapes and hydrological systems, albeit differently, in North America and Europe. On the southern margin of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in the Baltic Sea basin, a specific type of valley has developed between glacial margins and upland or mountain slopes. We studied new geological data (boreholes, electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) from this geomorphic setting in Northeast Poland to understand: (1) how the landscape and river network evolved to eventually produce peat mires during the Holocene, and (2) the nature of groundwater recharge to fens in the upper Biebrza Valley. We present the results on a geological cross-section with hydrogeological interpretation. We also discuss regional geomorphology. In addition, we present the LGM extent derived from a spatial distribution of Vistulian (Weichselian) terminal moraines. These end moraines are also interpreted as Saalian kames. Thus, we additionally present another method of LGM extent delineation from a physicogeographical division. We link the steep slopes of the studied valley walls (kame terrace fronts) with thermokarst erosion in the periglacial zone. We then document the hydrogeological window (DISCONTINUITY in the till layer over the confined aquifer), which enables the outflow of groundwater into the peat bog. Although minerotrophic fen mire development in the study area is likely to be sustained in the near future through sufficient groundwater supply, the projected capture of the Biebrza River by the Neman River will not allow for sustaining peatland development.

AB The investigations were carried out in six small mid-forest peat bogs with active peat-forming processes, all situated in the Lublin region (Eastern Poland). The bogs represented two floristically different types of peatland: raised bogs and transitional mires species composition analysis and specific chemistry analysis (pH, Eh, carbon content, N, P, Mg, Na, Ca, Mn, Fe, dehydrogenase activity and water level) were performed. The plant assotiations/communities of the peat bogs represented three phytosociological classes: Scheuchzerio-Caricetea nigrae, Oxycocco-Sphagnetea, and Vaccinio-Piceetea. The analysis of redox potential measured in the different communities revealed differences in the Eh values between these phytocoenoses (p < 0.001). Assotiations representing Vaccinio uliginosi-Pinetwn were found in areas characterised by the highest redox potential. Redox potential values in these communities were significantly higher than the values recorded in bog communities and mosaic associations. Seasonal variability of the redox potential was noted as well. The current research indicates that soil chemical parameters: pH, Eh are closely related with water table level and plant distributions.

AB Contaminants from Risby Landfill (Denmark) are expected to leach through the underlying geologic strata and eventually reach the local Risby Stream. Identification of the groundwater discharge zone was conducted systematically by an array of methods including studies on site geology and hydrogeology, ground- and surface water flows and landfill leachate tracing from April 2009 to December 2010. Chemical profiling by driven wells and gradients in streambed temperatures was an efficient method to identify the contaminant discharge area. A considerable variation of leachate indicators, redox parameters and xenobiotic organic compounds were revealed in this area because of a complex geological setting with clay till (interbedded sand lenses) and deposits of sand and peat. Concentrations of leachate indicators decreased from the landfill to the stream, implying attenuation processes. Xenobiotic organic compounds were mainly phenoxy acid herbicides, while petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents were found at very few boreholes. Findings of putative metabolites of phenoxy acid herbicides suggest degradation under the anaerobic conditions, which dominated inside and beneath the landfill. The groundwater discharge was quantified by two methods: direct collection of discharged groundwater by seepage meters and calculations from measurement of streambed temperature gradients. The landfill impacted the stream seasonally during dry periods when concentrations in the stream reached groundwater concentration levels. A comparison between mass balance for selected stream stretches and upscaled measurements of the contaminant discharge from groundwater into the stream indicated that only a small part of the actual contaminant discharge of the stream could be explained by the inflowing contaminant discharge from groundwater. Surface runoff and seepage from ponds along the stream impacted by landfill interflow may be important pathways as well. The placement of Risby landfill near a stream and the complex source and geology causing a large spatial variability of leachate compounds are typical for landfill sites so the approaches and findings from Risby Landfill can be applied to other landfill sites. The study highlights that landfills may pose a risk to surface waters and future studies should be directed towards evaluation of both chemical and ecological risk. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Large raised bogs and patterned fens cover 56% of the landscape in the Glacial Lake Agassiz region of northern Minnesota (USA). Organic acids supply most of the acidity in the surface water of the bogs, but groundwater upwelling from the underlying glacial deposits neutralizes these organic acids within deep peat. Substantial concentrations of organic acids also occur in the surface waters of fens mixed with variable amounts of inorganic solutes contributed by groundwater discharge. We used a triprotic analog model to determine the extent to which organic acids in fen and bog waters behave as strong or weak acids. The modeling approach optimized charge balance by calibrating estimates of mole site density in the DOC (dissolved organic carbon) of surface and pore waters with estimates of triprotic acid dissociation constants. Before the calibration process, all of the bog waters and 76% of the fen waters had more than + 20% imbalance in charge balance. After calibration, more than 75% of all waters were electrochemically balanced within 20%. In the best calibration. the mole site denisty of bog DOC was estimated as similar to 0.05 mmol/mmol C., approximately six times smaller than that estimated for fen DOC or the DOC in the fen deeper fen peats that underlie all bog landforms. The three modeled de-protonation constants were; pK(a1) = similar to 3.0. pK(a2) = similar to 4.5 and pK(a3) = similar to 7.0 for the bog DOC, and; pK(a1) = similar to 5.2, pK(a2) = similar to 6.5 and pK(a3) = similar to 7.0 for the fen DOC. Bog DOC, behaves as a strong acid despite its small mole site density. The DOC in bog runoff can therefore theoretically acidify the surface waters in adjacent fens wherever these waters do not receive sufficient buffering alkalinity from active groundwater seepage.

AB We report the results of an investigation on the processes controlling heat transport in peat under a large bog in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands. For 2 years, starting in July 1998, we recorded temperature at 12 depth intervals from 0 to 400 cm within a vertical peat profile at the crest of the bog at sub-daily intervals. We also recorded air temperature I m above the peat surface. We calculate a peat thermal conductivity of 0.5 W m(-1)degrees C(-1) and model vertical heat transport through the peat using the SUTRA model. The model was calibrated to the first year of data, and then evaluated against the second year of collected heat data. The model results suggest that advective pore-water flow is not necessary to transport heat within the peat profile and most of the heat is transferred by thermal conduction alone in these waterlogged soils. In the spring season, a zero-curtain effect controls the transport of heat through shallow depths of the peat. Changes in local climate and the resulting changes in thermal transport still may cause non-linear feedbacks in methane emissions related to the generation of methane deeper within the peat profile as regional temperatures increase.

AB Surface-water and ground-water flow are coupled in the central Everglades, although the remoteness of this system has hindered many previous attempts to quantify interactions between surface water and ground water. We modeled flow through a 43,000 ha basin in the central Everglades called Water Conservation Area 2A. The purpose of the model was to quantify recharge and discharge in the basin's vast interior areas. The presence and distribution of tritium in ground water was the principal constraint on the modeling, based on measurements in 25 research wells ranging in depth from 2 to 37 m. In addition to average characteristics of surface-water flow, the model parameters included depth of the layer of 'interactive' ground water that is actively exchanged with surface water, average residence time of interactive ground water, and the associated recharge and discharge fluxes across the wetland ground surface. Results indicated that only a relatively thin (8 m) layer of the 60 m deep surfical aquifer actively exchanges surface water and ground water on a decadal timescale. The calculated storage depth of interactive ground water was 3.1 m after adjustment for the porosity of peat and sandy limestone. Modeling of the tritium data yielded an average residence time of 90 years in interactive ground water, with associated recharge and discharge fluxes equal to 0.01 cm d(-1).H-3/He-3 isotopic ratio measurements (which correct for effects of vertical mixing in the aquifer with deeper, tritium-dead water) were available from several wells, and these indicated an average residence time of 25 years, suggesting that residence time was overestimated using tritium measurements alone. Indeed, both residence time and storage depth would be expected to be overestimated due to vertical mixing. The estimate of recharge and discharge (0.01 cm d(-1)) that resulted from tritium modeling therefore is still considered reliable, because the ratio of residence time and storage depth (used to calculated recharge and discharge) is much less sensitive to vertical mixing compared with residence time alone. We conclude that a small but potentially significant component of flow through the Everglades is recharged to the aquifer and stored there for years to decades before discharged back to surface water. Long-term storage of water and solutes in the ground-water system beneath the wetlands has implications for restoration of Everglades water quality. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Open ditch drainage is a commonly implemented land management practice in upland blanket peatlands, particularly in the UK, where policy decisions between the 1940s and 1970s led to widespread drainage of the uplands. The change in the hydrological regime associated with the drainage of blanket peat is poorly understood, yet has perceived importance for flooding, low flows and water quality. We propose a new simplified physics-based model that allows the associated hydrological processes and flow responses to be explored. The model couples four one-dimensional models to represent a three-dimensional hillslope, allowing for the exploration of flow and water table response throughout the model domain for a range of drainage configurations and peat properties. The model is tested against a data set collected from Oughtershaw Beck, UK, with results showing good model performance for wet periods although less conformity with borehole observations during rewetting periods. A wider exploration of model behaviour indicates that the model is consistent with the hydrological response reported in the literature for a number of drained blanket peat sites, and therefore has potential to provide guidance to decision makers concerning the effects of management practices. Through a global sensitivity analysis, we conclude that further field investigations to assist in the surface and drain roughness parameterisation would help reduce the uncertainty in the model predictions.

AB Little attention has been given to the pattern of hydrological connectivity between peatlands and water bearing fracture zones in crystalline bedrock. The construction of the railway tunnel Romeriksporten provided an opportunity for studying impacts of bedrock tunnelling on peatland hydrology and the hydraulic connectivity between peat deposits and deeper layers in an area with fractured Precambrian gneisses, exposed bedrock, and surficial covers of thin till deposits and peatsoils. Above the tunnel the water level in peat wells fluctuated with maximum depths up to 3 m, and water that otherwise would have generated surface runoff infiltrated in the peat. Drawdowns of the groundwater table in peatlands were observed as far as 340 m away from the tunnel trace. The deep drainage base provided prolonged water table drawdowns in peatlands in dry periods, and differential settlements in drained peatsoils resulted in secondary changes in patterns of surface water storage and flow. The groundwater drawdowns were influenced by the balance between tunnel leakage and water supplies from catchments and the wetland position within the groundwater flow system. Deep and simultaneous lowering and fluctuations of hydraulic heads in wells in the peat, the subpeat sediments and the bedrock above the tunnel demonstrated hydraulic connectivity between the peat layers and the bedrock, and revealed vertical flow even through highly humified peat layers in the catotelm. This shows that in peatlands with a subsurface of a relatively thin till cover above fractured crystalline bedrock, favourable conditions for groundwater flow from peatsoils to rock are not always restricted to a few specific sites, and indicates that attention should be given to the influence of peat water-bedrock water connectivity on impacts of groundwater exploitation, droughts and climate changes in such areas.

AB The manager of the Lavours Natural Reserve attends since the late eighties to a drying of parts of the peat bog. To better understand the ecological processes, a better understanding of the hydrological functioning is necessary. The reserve was prospected to upgrade the cartography of the drainage network and to provide a vision of the water flow dynamic. Further, the evolution of network drainage through time was explained by digitalizing historic maps available. Historical values of altitude were compared to recent data to estimate the subsidence of the peat bog. The overall results show the significant impact of recent developments on the drying of peat, whether across the marsh (ditches, valves) or larger scale (channelization of the Rhone River). Highlighting hydrological processes in the reserve can guide the manager in his actions to preserve the environment.

AB Overland flow is an important component of peatland hydrology. Hydrological models of peatlands are being developed that require estimates of flow velocity and its controls. However, surprisingly little is known about overland flow velocities in peatlands. Some peatlands have also been drained using open ditches, and these need to be incorporated into flow models. This paper presents field data on the velocity of overland flow and drain flow in upland peatlands. The relationships between flow velocity, vegetation cover, slope, and water depth are explored. Sphagnum provided a significantly greater effective hydraulic roughness to overland flow than peatland grasses. In all cases, a significant break in process occurred for flows with water depths of around 1 cm so that there were two components of the roughness curve. This is consistent with partial submergence theory for very shallow flows where resistance increases with depth as the soil surface first becomes fully submerged. While each surface cover type should be considered separately, the results also suggest that a first-order estimate of Darcy-Weisbach roughness and mean velocity can be based on a single parameter for each surface cover. This paper presents an empirical overland flow velocity forecasting model that can be applied to peatlands. The model combines the partially submerged component for flows with water depths below 1 cm with the fully submerged component for flows with depths up to 5 cm, which are representative of the depths of flows that occur across peatlands.

AB The hydrological and floristic variation within a mire vegetation is mostly controlled by three ecological gradients: nutrient availability, acidity-alkalinity, and water table depth. The objectives of this study were: (a) to analyse the hydrochemistry of a mixed mire in relation to different habitat conditions; (b) to evaluate the patterns of vascular plant composition in relation to nutrient availability, acidity-alkalinity, and water table depth, and to partition the pure effects of these gradients. Within a mixed mire, we sampled 36 small plots to cover all vegetation types present. Then, the chemical water properties, and the water regime were measured during a growing season. Water chemistry proved to be significantly different between the various vegetation types. Two biological systems could be identified according to hydrochemistry and vascular plant composition: (1) several fen vegetation types lacking raised Sphagnum structures where the water chemistry reflected groundwater properties; (2) bog Sphagnum-dominated vegetation, where the convex shape of the mire surface prevented mixing with the groundwater. The results of the partitioning indicated that the acidity-alkalinity gradient was more important in controlling the patterns of plant distribution than water table depth.

AB Knowledge of the hydrological mechanisms that underlie stable plant communities within natural fens is essential for the improvement of current fen restoration and conservation strategies. In this study, steady-state groundwater modelling was performed to quantify the impact of throughflow mechanisms on the presence of exfiltrated, alkaline groundwater across a near-natural fen in the Biebrza River catchment (Poland). Alkaline groundwater is considered essential for the existence of low-productive fen plants. The results indicate that throughflow redistributes exfiltrated groundwater, mixed with locally infiltrated precipitation, in various concentrations across the fen. The throughflow model provides an explanation for the major patterns in the plant alliances that have a preference for minerotrophic or ombrotrophic habitat conditions. These patterns could not be reproduced with groundwater models that did not account for the existence of throughflow on a regional scale. We conclude that throughflow (1) enables a spatially contiguous supply of exfiltrated groundwater across fens, and thereby (2) facilitates abiotic conditions suitable for fen plants outside the zones that are directly supplied by exfiltrated groundwater. These new insights into landscape hydrological mechanisms that drive abiotic conditions within natural fens necessitate the reprioritisation of current hydrological fen restoration strategies.

AB (Characterisation of Sanguinhal Mire, Terceira Island (Azores): a protected quaking bog habitat). The Azores archipelago in the North Atlantic is an important area for biodiversity because it is rich in rare species and habitats, and almost undisturbed. Sanguinhal mire was originally a lake that evolved through paludification into a peat habitat. It is located inside Nature 2000 (European Union for Protection of Nature and Biodiversity, Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, Habitat Directive Annex 1(b) habitat 7140) area of Santa Barbara and Pico Alto Mountains on the island of Terceira, and it is a good example of a basin peatland type that was first discovered in 1998. This paper provides baseline information on its flora, vegetation communities, structure, surface hydrology and chemistry. Forty-one plant species including six Sphognum species and ten endemic vascular plants have been recorded, and eight plant communities are distinguished. The maximum peat depth is 2.5 m. The mire receives flowing water from its margins, in addition to intercepted precipitation and fog. After precipitation, water drains through several placic rupture points. Both pH and water conductivity were measured, with some ecological tendencies observed. The conservation status of the mire is good, but it is subject to increasing pressure from cattle pasture and a walking trail that constrains natural surface water movement.

AB We studied the effects of restoration on water-table depth (WTD), element concentrations of peat and vegetation composition of peatlands drained for forestry in southern Finland. The restoration aimed to return the trajectory of vegetation succession toward that of undisturbed systems through the blockage of ditches and the removal of trees. Permanent plots established on a bog and a fen were sampled 1 year before, and 1, 2, 3, and 10 years after the restoration. The restoration resulted in a long-term rise of the water-table in both peatlands. Ten years after restoration, the mineral element concentrations (Ca, K, Mg, Mn, and P) of peat corresponded to those reported from comparable pristine peatlands. In particular, the increase of K and Mn concentrations at both sites suggests the recovery of ecosystem functionality in terms of nutrient cycling between peat and plants. The restoration resulted in the succession of plant communities toward the targeted peatland vegetation of wetter condition at both sites. This was evident from the decreased abundance of species benefiting from drainage and the corresponding increase of peatland species. However, many species typical of pristine peatlands were missing 10 years after restoration. We conclude that the restoration led to a reversal of the effects of drainage in vegetation and studied habitat conditions. However, due to the slow recovery of peatland ecosystems and the possibility that certain failures in the restoration measures may become apparent only after extended time periods, long-term monitoring is needed to determine whether the goals of restoration will be met.

AB Freshwater pools commonly form eccentric crescent patterns in peatlands, an important atmospheric methane (CH4) source, and show an apparent spatial association with eskers in some deglaciated regions. However, the role of underlying permeable glacial deposits such as eskers in regulating hydrogeology, and perhaps even carbon cycling, in peatlands is rarely considered. In this study, ground-penetrating radar imaging and direct coring confirmed that clustered pools coincide with buried esker crests in contact with peat soil in Caribou Bog and Kanokolus Bog in Maine (USA). Hydraulic head and geochemical data combined with lidar indicate vertical water flow from shallow peat toward the permeable esker crests, suggesting enhanced downward transport of labile organic carbon that presumably accelerates rates of methanogenesis in deep peat. Eskers might therefore serve as proxies for enhanced CH4 production in deep peat, as supported by differences in dissolved CH4 profiles depending on proximity to pools. Geographic data compiled from multiple sources suggest that many peatlands with eccentric pools appear to be located proximal to esker systems in Maine and Fennoscandia. These geological factors may be important, previously unrecognized controls on water and the carbon cycle in peatlands.

AB An important uncertainty in the interpretation of peat-based Holocene climate reconstructions is what aspect of climate is recorded. Testate amoeba palaeoecological records have generally been interpreted in terms of water table depth but an increasing weight of experimental evidence shows that testate amoeba communities may respond to temperature independent of hydrological variability. In most ombrotrophic peatlands, variability in water table depth is driven by a combination of both temperature and precipitation, making it difficult to isolate any direct forcing by temperature. An unusual peatland ecosystem in which water tables are extremely stable offers an approach to this question. If testate amoeba communities show variability through time in these percolation bogs this implies a direct influence of temperature. This study presents a late Holocene testate amoeba record from the Imnati percolation bog in western Georgia. Below a phase of recent eutrophication results show essentially no variability in testate amoeba community composition or inferred water table depth through more than 4m of peat representing over 2000 years. It is improbable that there has been no temperature variability over this period and the data therefore imply that direct temperature forcing of the palaeoecological record is minimal, at least for this region and time-scale.

AB Peat is unconsolidated superficial deposits with high non-crystalline colloid (humus) content, constituting the subsurface of wetland systems. Electro-osmosis is one of the electrokinetic phenomena and consists of the motion of liquid through a microporous medium under the influence of an applied electrical field. Electro-osmotic behavior of peat with regard to its degree of humification was investigated. The results of the study showed that the water flowed from the anode to the cathode due to the negative surface charge of the peats. The coefficients of electro-osmotic conductivity ranges of the peats were from 4.91x10(-06) to 1.57x10(-05) cm(2)Vs(-1). The greater degree of humification resulted in higher electro-osmotic conductivity and higher coefficient of electroosmotic water transport efficiency.

AB An extended water regime model was used for calculating the evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and peat mineralization (CO2 and N release) for various fen locations with grassland utilization in dependence on the groundwater level. The results show that an increasing groundwater level leads to a strong decline of the actual evapotranspiration E-t. For example, increasing the groundwater level from 30 to 120 cm diminishes the E-t by up to 230 mm a(-1). A positive groundwater recharge only takes place at groundwater levels of 90 cm and more. At smaller distances the capillary rise into the rooting zone during the summer months is greater than the water seepage during the winter months, so that a negative groundwater recharge-balance is reached in the course of a year. The CO2- and the N-release, as well as the annual decline in peat thickness, increase significantly with rising groundwater levels. The results show that varying the groundwater level can influence the water regime and the peat mineralization significantly. The lower the groundwater level the less is the peat decomposition. The demand for a groundwater level as small as possible is, however; limited by an agricultural utilization of the fens. Choosing the optimum groundwater level should consider the aims (1) peat mineralization, (2) gas emission (CO2, CH4; N2O), and (3) crop production. If a grassland utilization is supposed to be made possible and all three aims above are given equal importance, the groundwater level should be maintained at 30 cm. At this distance, about 90 % of the optimum plant output can be reached. The peat mineralization can be reduced to 30 to 40 % of the maximum peat mineralization.

AB Linear disturbances such as roads are common in areas of intensive resource development. When roads cross peatlands, they can interrupt natural hydrologic processes and alter vegetation composition and structure. Hydrological changes to a poor fen impacted by a road in northeastern Alberta were evaluated using tree rings of living and dead black spruce trees. All trees that were less than 83.5 cm above the road's single culvert died in 1989. The temporal uniformity of dieback suggested that a single inundation event caused the trees to drown. The inundation likely was caused by a culvert blocked by beavers, and indicates the critical role of hydrologic patterns and processes for controlling vegetation composition, including tree growth patterns and mortality. The disturbance of peatlands by roads could be reduced or eliminated by improving road designs to include multiple culverts that cannot easily be blocked by debris or beavers, or underdrain systems that create more natural surface and ground water flow patterns. In addition, regular inspection and maintenance could limit the negative effects of blocked point locations that can be dammed by beavers.

DE Groundwater; Floods; Nitrogen; Cranberry; Agriculture
ID MANAGEMENT; WETLANDS; STREAMS; WATER; BOG
AB Seasonal flooding of cranberry farms is essential for commercial production of cranberries in southeastern Massachusetts, with close to 90% of growers using a flood for harvesting and winter protection. Although periodic flooding results in increased groundwater recharge, it may also exacerbate subsurface transport of dissolved forms of nitrogen and phosphorus. Given the paucity of information on groundwater exchange with cranberry floodwaters, hydrometric measurements were used to solve for the residual term of groundwater recharge in water budgets for three cranberry farms during the harvest and winter floods. Combined with continuous monitoring of water-table depth and discrete sampling of groundwater for analysis of nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), values of groundwater recharge were used to evaluate the hydrologic and nutrient response of groundwater to flooding of cranberry farms. Mean values of groundwater recharge were 11 (+/- 6) and 47 (+/- 11) cm for the harvest and winter floods, respectively (one standard deviation in parentheses). The factor-of-four difference in ground recharge was related to flood holding times that, on average, were twenty days longer for the winter flood. The total estimated seasonal groundwater recharge of 58 cm was about four times higher than that assigned to cranberry farms in regional groundwater flow models. During the floods, 10 to 20-cm increases in water-table depth were observed for wells within 10 m of the farm, contrasting with decreases (or minimal variation) in water-table depth for wells located 100 m or farther from the farm. These spatial patterns in the hydrologic response of groundwater suggested a zone of influence of approximately 100 m from the flooded edge of the farm. Analysis of 43 groundwater samples collected from 10 wells indicated generally low concentrations of TDP in groundwater (<0.32 mu M for 84% of the samples). Nitrate accounted for 85% of the dissolved inorganic N in groundwater, exhibiting a spatial pattern of decreasing concentration with increasing distance from the farm (e.g., values were consistently less than 3.6 pM for wells located similar to 100 m from the flooded edge of farms). For one groundwater well located in proximity to the farm (similar to 10 m), decreases in NO3- concentration from 565 mu M (pre-flood) to 99 mu M (post-flood) were consistent with winter floodwater as a source of low-NO3- groundwater recharge.

AB 1 Raised bogs of the boreal and temperate zone typically show surface patterning on two distinct organizational levels. A conspicuous pattern of alternating dry strings and wet flarks aligned perpendicular to the slope occurs in combination with other microtopes, resulting in a mesotope pattern.
   2 Patterning on both these levels can be explained by a simple, spatially explicit model that assumes predominantly lateral water flow through an acrotelm that is draped over a dome-shaped catotelm. The model distinguishes two types of surface elements: hummocks with low transmissivity growing under dry conditions and hollows with high transmissivity growing under wet conditions.
   3 Hummocks dam up water and stimulate the development of hollows upslope, whereas hollows effectively drain upslope areas, stimulating the development of hummocks. If the dome is steep and the recharge high enough, this leads to the development of a string-flark microtope.
   4 Four distinct types of microtopes are distinguished: (i) areas entirely covered by hummocks, (ii) randomly arranged hummocks and hollows, (iii) string-flark striping patterns and (iv) areas entirely covered by hollows.
   5 Different combinations of sharply delineated microtopes occur with different parameter settings, allowing for the classification of four types of raised bog mesotopes. In addition to such qualitative differences, the extent and composition of the microtopes vary with parameter settings, reflecting the variety observed in natural systems.
   6 Our simple simulation model shows how small-scale, local processes can create a variety of large and complex landscape patterns. These patterns can be used to describe raised bogs in terms of biological entities of a higher organizational order (ecosystem biodiversity), typically recognizable in often species-poor peatland ecosystems.

AB This study aimed to measure the effects of ecological restoration on blanket peat water table depths and CO2 fluxes. The flux of CO2 and water table depths were measured on eight sites for 5 years. Results suggest that sites with revegetation alongside slope stabilisation have the highest rates of photosynthesis and are the largest net (daylight hours) sinks of CO2. Bare sites are the largest net sources of CO2 and have the deepest water table depths. Sites with gully wall stabilisation are between 5 and 8 times more likely to be net CO2 sinks than the bare sites. Revegetation without gully flow blocking using plastic dams does not have a large effect on water table depths in and around the gullies investigated whereas a blocked gully has water table depths comparable to a naturally revegetating gully. A 10 cm lowering in water table depth decreases the probability of observing a net CO2 sink, on a given site, by up to 30 %. The most important conclusion of this research was that restoration interventions are effective at increasing the likelihood of net CO2 sink behaviour and raising water tables on degraded, climatically marginal blanket bog.

AB To test the hypothesis that long-term peat accumulation is related to contemporary carbon flux dynamics, we present the Peat Decomposition Model (PDM), a new model of long-term peat accumulation. Decomposition rates of the deeper peat are directly related to observable decomposition rates of fresh vegetation litter, Plant root effects (subsurface oxygenation and fresh litter inputs) are included. PDM considers two vegetation types, vascular and nonvascular, with different decomposition rates and aboveground and belowground litter input rates. We used PDM to investigate the sensitivities of peat accumulation in bogs and fens to productivity, root:shoot ratio, tissue decomposability, root and water table depths, and climate. Wanner and wetter conditions are more conducive to peat accumulation. Bogs are more sensitive than fens to climate conditions. Cooler and drier conditions lead to the lowest peat accumulation when productivity is more temperature sensitive than decomposition rates. We also compare peat age-depth profiles to field data. With a very general parameterization, PDM fen and bog age-depth profiles were similar to data from the the most recent 5000 years at three bog cores and a fen core in eastern Canada, but they overestimated accumulation at three other bog cores in that region. The model cannot reliably predict the amount of fen peat remaining from the first few millennia of a peatland's development. This discrepancy may relate to nonanalogue, early postglacial climatic and nutrient conditions for rich-fen peat accumulation and to the fate of this fen peat material, which is overlain by a bog as the peatland evolves, a common hydroseral succession in northern peatlands. Because PDM sensitivity tests point to these possible factors, we conclude that the static model represents a framework that shows a consistent relationship between contemporary productivity and fresh-tissue decomposition rates and observed long-term peat accumulation.

AB Hydraulic conductivity (K) is a key but problematic parameter in groundwater models particularly those that simulate flow in weak, readily deformable media, such as peat deposits. As a result, K represents a critical source of error in models that couple hydrological processes with the carbon balance of peatlands, a globally important source for greenhouse gases. We therefore conducted mini-aquifer tests on two mesoscale bog landforms within the large 1300 km(2) Red Lake Peatland of northern Minnesota. These tests offer the dual advantage of determining the fine-scale distribution of K within a large (>900 m(3)) model domain. In addition, the stress created by a 24 h pumping operation should be capable of mobilizing pools of biogenic gases thoughout a deep peat deposit. The pumping results were monitored by 24 to 38 wells in order to calibrate a 3D finite-volume groundwater model with the aid of PEST (Parameter Estimation Analysis). High K values were determined at a Bog Forest (10(-5) to 10(-6) m s(-1)) and Bog Lawn (10(-3) to 10(-4) m s(-1)) sites, throughout their deep (>4 m) peat profiles. These tests also detected vertically continuous zones of unexpectedly high or low K values in contrast to the horizontal bedding planes and increasing degree of decomposition with depth. The vertical K zones are suggestive of three different modes of bubble transport that either locally dilate or partially block the peat pores. In addition, the tests provided new insights on a conceptual model linking K to the development of all large (>20 km(2)) forested bog complexes in mid-continental boreal North America.

AB Anisotropy and heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity (K) are seldom considered in models of mire hydrology. We investigated the effect of anisotropy and heterogeneity on groundwater flow in bog peat using a steady-state groundwater model. In five model simulations, four sets of K data were used. The first set comprised measured K values from an anisotropic and heterogeneous bog peat. These data were aggregated to produce the following simplified data sets: an isotropic and heterogeneous distribution of K; an isotropic and homogeneous distribution; and an anisotropic and homogeneous distribution. We demonstrate that, where anisotropy and heterogeneity exist, groundwater flow in bog peat is complex. Fine-scale variations in K have the potential to influence patterns and rates of groundwater flow. However, for our data at least, it is heterogeneity and not anisotropy that has the greater influence on producing complex patterns of groundwater flow. We also demonstrate that patterns and rates of groundwater flow are simplified and reduced when measured K values are aggregated to create a more uniform distribution of K. For example, when measured K values are aggregated to produce isotropy and homogeneity, the rate of modelled seepage is reduced by 28%. We also show that when measured K values are used, the presence of a drainage ditch can increase seepage through a modelled cross-section. Our work has implications for the accurate interpretation of hydraulic head data obtained from peat soils, and also the understanding of the effect of drainage ditches on patterns and rates of groundwater flow.

AB Situated in the Campine region of Belgium, which is known for its thick sandy deposits and acid soils, the Buitengoor is a small headwater valley fen, containing many rich fen indicator species that are typical of neutral to alkaline soils. A hydrochemical survey of the surroundings of the fen pointed to an irrigation canal as a possible source of alkalinity for the fen. Just upstream of the fen, the alkaline canal water recharges the ground water. A piezometer transect from the canal to the fen illustrated the recharge pathway and the fate of alkalinity, cations and nutrients in the aquifer. Alkalinity and base cations are supplied to the fen while nutrients disappear out of solution. Although the normal hydroseral development of this fen would have been directed towards bog, the canal water caused an opposite development towards rich fen. This result illustrates the potential for groundwater flow systems to reverse peatland development in a short period of time (the canals were built in the last century). The potential for restoration of the rich fen habitat is discussed.

AB Runoff generation and fluxes of dissolved elements were studied in two drained peatlands under different land uses during spring snowmelt 2012. One site experienced soil frost, whereas the other site was frost-free due to groundwater seepage. Runoff water was sampled at 12-hour intervals during the snowmelt peak and soil and snow samples were taken. All samples were analysed for oxygen-18 isotope and various water quality parameters. The results demonstrated the effect of soil frost on water flow paths, which further affected runoff water quality. At the frost-free site, seepage through the peat soil profile was the main flow route during snowmelt runoff generation, which could be seen e.g., as high DOC concentration in the stream. At the site with soil frost, meltwater could not infiltrate into the soil, leading to overland flow and lower concentrations of elements in water during the peak snowmelt period.

AB Wetlands comprise 14% of the land area of Canada. They have considerable impact on water storage and runoff, water quality, atmospheric exchanges of carbon, and important elements such as nitrogen. In less remote parts of Canada, wetlands have suffered from reclamation, exploitation, contamination and degradation, which have seriously impaired their ecological function. Public recognition of their environmental significance has highlighted the need for a better understanding of the hydrological processes, to better plan and manage wetland areas, restore degraded systems, and predict responses to global change. This paper reviews current hydrological research in all types of Canadian wetlands. The scope of hydrological processes discussed herein includes runoff, surface and groundwater flows, evaporation, microclimate, water balance, geochemical and solute transport phenomenon, carbon dynamics, isotope studies, exploitation and restoration.

AB Spring-fed fens in Wardzyn represent the rare group of alkaline mires supplied by artesian groundwater. Using multidisciplinary methods (including sedimentological, hydrometric and hydrochemical, pollen, macrofossil, malacological, geochemical, radiocarbon dating, and stable oxygen and carbon isotope analyses) we have been able to (1) reconstruct the main phases of spring-fed fen development, and to (2) determine the cause of Neoholocene groundwater ascension responsible for the mire inception. These phases are characterized by cyclic organic (peat) and carbonate (tufa) sedimentation associated with the Holocene fluctuations in humidity and temperature. The beginning of the activation of hydrological systems (involving the flow of confined groundwater of the Cretaceous aquifer) at Wardzyn occurred in the Subboreal period of the Holocene, after a long episode of decreased humidity initiated ca. 4.2 ka cal BP.

DE Peatland; Groundwater; Fen; Montane
ID RETENTION; NEVADA
AB Persistently wet conditions are essential to prevent the decomposition of organic material that forms peatlands. Wetlands in areas with a snow-melt dominated precipitation regime and little or no summer precipitation often rely on groundwater to meet late-season water requirements. Past and predicted changes in climate for the Sierra Nevada show a trend towards more winter precipitation falling as rain rather than snow. This is expected to result in reduced late-season water availability and the subsequent degradation of peatlands. Measurements of groundwater levels, stream flow, specific conductance, and peat water retention characteristics are used to quantify aspects of the hydrologic system that supports Grass Lake, south of Lake Tahoe California, the largest peatland in the Sierra Nevada. Water budget calculations using periodic measurements collected throughout the growing season show that groundwater discharge is a significant component of the water balance in the late-summer and fall. Late-season evapotranspiration needs were approximately balanced by groundwater inflow for 2010 (average water year). Groundwater discharge to the peatland dominated the late-season water budget in 2011 (above average water year) and persisted into October. Water retention experiments and field data suggest desaturation of the peatland accounts for approximately 0.5 mm day(-1), or roughly 10 % of the estimated evapotranspiration rate.

AB The accuracy of the Nitrogen and Carbon cycling in Soil, Water And Plant (NCSWAP) model to simulate (nitrate-nitrogen) NO3-N leaching from orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) pasture was evaluated using data collected from a 3-yr leaching experiment conducted in central Pennsylvania on Hagerstown silt loam soil (fine, mired, mesic, Typic Hapludalf). Nitrate leaching losses below the I-m depth from N-fertilized orchardgrass sod were measured with intact soil core lysimeters (0.6-m diam. by 1-m long), Five N-fertilizer treatments consisted of a control, urine application in the spring, urine application in the summer, urine application in the fall, and feces application in the summer were used to test the model, The model was calibrated using the data from 1993 to 1994 and then was validated using 1994 to 1995 and 1995 to 1996 water flow and NO3-N leaching data. Statistical analysis indicated a good fit between field measured and predicted NO3-N leaching for most treatments in each year. The model simulations of water flow and NO3-N leaching losses below the l-m depth were compared with the mean of measured field data for these 3 yr, The results of this study showed that the NCSWAP model performed well and accurately simulated water flow and total annual NO3-N loss through leaching below the l-m depth under orchardgrass pasture, However, the model failed to produce accurate simulations for the feces treatment in 1994 to 1995. The simulation error in the feces treatment seemed to be related to N mineralization process in the model, Generally, the results of this study suggest that the NCSWAP model can be used for predicting NO3-N leached annually from pastured orchardgrass.

AB The movement of water in milled peat is of importance to the peat industry particularly in terms of rewetting. Considering the importance of structure with regard to water flow, micromorphology was used to obtain information regarding the nature of milled peat as a porous medium in a manner not available by other means. Peat was sampled from the undisturbed surface of two bogs (raised and fen origin) and from milled peat stockpiles. Thin sections were prepared to describe the nature of the two peat materials (milled and unmilled) in terms of the particle / pore properties and composition. Image analysis and point counting techniques were used to quantify results wherever possible. Although overall macro-porosity was similar for the two stockpiles, particle and pore size distributions varied considerably. Variations arose from the nature of the peat type and its interaction with milling operations with results suggesting that smaller pore sizes relate to a greater propensity to rewet.

AB Northern peatlands cover more than 350 million ha and are an important source of methane (CH4) and other biogenic gases contributing to climate change. Free-phase gas (FPG) accumulation and episodic release has recently been recognized as an important mechanism for biogenic gas flux from peatlands. It is likely that gas production and groundwater flow are interconnected in peatlands: groundwater flow influences gas production by regulating geochemical conditions and nutrient supply available for methanogenesis, while FPG influences groundwater flow through a reduction in peat permeability and by creating excess pore water pressures. Water samples collected from three well sites at Caribou Bog, Maine, show substantial dissolved CH4 (5-16 mg L-1) in peat waters below 2 m depth and an increase in concentrations with depth. This suggests production and storage of CH4 in deep peat that may be episodically released as FPG. Two min increment pressure transducer data reveal approximately 5 cm fluctuations in hydraulic head from both deep and shallow peat that are believed to be indicative of FPG release. FPG release persists up to 24 h during decreasing atmospheric pressure and a rising water table. Preferential flow is seen towards an area of relatively lower hydraulic head associated with the esker and pool system. Increased CH4 concentrations are also found at the depth of the esker crest, suggesting that the high permeability esker is acting as a conduit for groundwater flow, driving a downward transport of labile carbon, resulting in higher rates of CH4 production.

AB Shallow, degraded peatlands differ in both their structure and function from deeper, peatland ecosystems. Previous work has shown that shallow, drained peatlands demonstrate rapid storm runoff that is only minimally controlled by antecedent hydrological conditions. However, such peatlands are also known to exhibit significant variation in ecohydrological organisation and structure across different spatial scales. In addition, predictions of hydrological response using spatially distributed numerical models of rainfall-runoff may be flawed unless they are evaluated with datasets describing the spatial variability of hydrological responses. This paper evaluates to what extent, flow generation and water storage within shallow, degraded peatland catchments may be controlled by the spatial attributes of the contributing area of the peatland, the drainage ditch size, morphology and geometry.
   Results from an experiment conducted over multiple spatial scales and multi-annual timescales highlights that subtle variations in the local slope and topography account for the long-term spatial patterns of water table depth. Neither the local scale of the drainage feature or the topographic contributing area is shown to be a definitive predictor of runoff in the studied catchments. Results also highlight the importance of using spatially distributed observations to ensure that estimates of water storage and runoff are representative of the fine scale spatial variability that occurs in such damaged and shallow peatlands.

AB Peatlands comprise a globally important carbon pool whose input-output budgets may be significantly altered by climate change. To experimentally determine the sensitivity of the carbon stored in peatlands to climate change, we constructed a mesocosm facility with 54 peat monoliths from a bog and fen in northern Minnesota, USA. These mesocosms were subjected to nine combinations of heat and water-table levels over eight years. Bog mesocosms initially accumulated soil carbon, with greater gains in wetter mesocosms, but after three years no further water-table effects occurred. In contrast, fen mesocosms lost or had no change in soil carbon, with the greatest losses in drier and warmer mesocosms. Changes in soil-carbon storage resulted in concomitant changes in water-table depth, so that water-table depths were similar to those in the natural source sites by the end of the experiment regardless of the initial treatment. These results were primarily due to water-table effects on Sphagnum moss production in the bog mesocosms and to a more complicated suite of warming and water-table effects on production and decomposition in the fen mesocosms. We show that different kinds of peatlands will rapidly gain or lose carbon following hydrological disturbance until they return to their characteristic ("equilibrium'') water-table levels. Our results illustrate the potential for a rapid homeostatic response of these ecosystems to future climate change at small spatial scales. Climate change will likely also interact with other carbon cycle-hydrological feedbacks at the scale of the entire peatland over longer time frames and larger spatial scales.

LA English
DT Review
DE ombrotrophic; mire; conservation; hydrology; grazing
ID GREAT-BRITAIN; PEAT
AB The vegetation, physical characteristics and conservation value of mires (peatlands) within Kielder Forest, northern England, are described. A review of the options available for their conservation management examines the effects of changes in the water table, the impact of grazing livestock and changes brought about by neighbouring conifer plantations.
   These raised and blanket mires vary in size from 0.6 to 69.6 ha, and are dominated by ombrotrophic vegetation. Their main conservation value lies in their 'naturalness', which arises from the extensive nature of locally used stock grazing systems and the intrinsic difficulty of draining mires that lie in depressions and experience an upland climate. Such sites are rare and contain uncommon plants and invertebrates, whilst collectively these mires exhibit considerable topographical and hydrological variety,
   A review of the hydrological effects of conifer plantations on mire catchments concludes that the catchments probably have little, if any, influence on the mires themselves. Management of water flow on the mires has the objective of reducing the rate of discharge of precipitation from them by damming agricultural and forestry drainage channels.
   A review of the role of livestock grazing concludes that there is no direct evidence to suggest that this is required to maintain the mire plant communities. Circumstantial evidence suggests that its impact is minimal on vegetation over deep peat, and probably most influential on vegetation over shallower peat at mire margins.

AB Peatlands are important terrestrial carbon stores and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is one of the most important contributors to carbon budgets in peatland systems. Many studies have investigated factors affecting DOC concentration in peatland systems, yet hillslope position has been thus far overlooked as a variable that could influence DOC cycling. This study investigates the importance of hillslope position with regard to DOC cycling. Two upland peat hillslopes were studied in the Peak District, UK, to determine what impact, if any, hillslope position had upon DOC concentration. Hillslope position was found to be a significant factor affecting variation in soil pore water DOC concentration, with bottom-slope positions having significantly lower DOC concentrations than up-slope because of dilution of DOC as water moves down-slope and is flushed out of the system via lateral throughflow. Water table drawdown on steeper mid-slopes increased DOC concentrations through increased DOC production and extended residence times allowing a build-up of humic-rich DOC compounds. Hillslope position did not significantly affect DOC concentrations in surface runoff water because of the dilution of near-surface soil pore water by precipitation inputs, while stream water had similar water chemistry properties to soil pore water under low-flow conditions.

AB Data on the distributed dynamics of water table elevation (WTE) and on the variation of water discharge are needed for calculation of the carbon balances of entire mire complexes. Here we describe the development of a high-resolution transient hydrological model for the extensive boreal bog complex at Mukhrino in West Siberia (Asian Russia). The model, developed in PCRaster-MODFLOW, outputs spatially distributed WTE and daily water fluxes in 3D. It incorporates snowmelt dynamics and temporal freezing of the upper peat layer. During the period 2008-2016 snowmelt occurred during 2-4 weeks per year and accounted for 30 % of the total volume of water available for recharge and evapotranspiration. The calibrated hydraulic conductivity of the acrotelm was 0.6-1.2 cm s(-1). Model outputs indicated that the annual amplitude of WTE variation was 10-20 cm, in agreement with on-site measurements. Snowmelt raised the water table by 5-10 cm at the water divide and by 10-20 cm near the margin of the bog. In the ridge-hollow complex on the mire expanse, 91% of all spring water fluxes discharged through the acrotelm in hollows, whereas the ridges retarded runoff. Based on modelled water fluxes and measurements of DOC we estimated that the organic carbon (DOC) export from the bog complex was 7.7 g m(-2) y(-1).

AB The influence of wetlands on the water supply of rivers has been discussed in media and some academic papers for more than 100 years. The first papers were published after draining the Polesye wetlands in Belarus in 1880's. Formation and hydrological role of wetlands in biosphere are considered. The influence of wetlands on the water supply of rivers is shown on the basis of multi-year stationary research. The reasons for reducing of water discharge in rivers with overgrowing of lakes and formation of wetlands on their place are described. The features of value of water flow from drained swamps in rivers obtained in 15-years stationary water-balance research were calculated according to the runoff rates. Water permeability of wetlands along the peat deposit depth were studied. The reasons for change in filtration of groundwater after hydromelioration of wetlands were established. The influence of steam flows inside the swamps on water discharge and entry of water into rivers were studied. There is a break in water flow from wetlands to rivers, especially in summer period. The reasons for "drainless periods" duration and the concept of "zero flow" (when groundwater flows into channels, but does not enter rivers) were explained. The influence of hydromelioration on the growth of pine forest stands, the improvement of their bonitet class in swamps were studied. The dependence of water discharge on bonitet class of forest stands was shown. It was established that water discharge from drained swamps during the year is more leveled off by reducing the spring flood flow and increasing the flow in summer period, which ensures the uniformity of river water supply.

AB In the coal-bearing deposits of the Qiongdongnan Basin in the South China Sea, coal seams are for the most part extremely thin, typically less than 0.5 m. Coal streaks are commonly observed but are not concentrated. In addition, the ash content of the coal components is very high, indicating that the geological conditions of peat accumulation and coal formation were very unstable. For these reasons, it can be speculated that at the time of development, peat mires were relatively poor, in terms of inheritance and continuity, and were commonly not preserved. Coal measures, coal seams (in situpeat accumulation over long distances) and dispersed terrigenous sedimentary organic matter, which together constitute a type of complex coal source-to-sink system found in basin-marginal basins, include three aspects. (1) The material is homologous: whether autochthonous accumulation, allochthonous accumulation or dispersed organic matter is present, the total organic matter source is homologous,i.e.suitable for development and plant growth. (2) The process of organic matter transport (channel) is divided into three forms: vertical accumulationin situ, transport to relatively fixed areas by flowing water, and transport by other mechanisms with long-distance dispersion and drift. (3) There are three types of aggregation forms: vertical accumulationin situ, transport from flowing water to relatively fixed areas away from where plants grow and aggregate, and deposition in deep-water basins fixed with other substances; the latter type requires a period of time for long-distance dispersion and drift, including channel flow and surface flow.

AB Hydrological monitoring in an eroded South Pennine peatland shows that persistent and frequent water table drawdowns occur at gully edge locations, defining a deeper and thicker acrotelm than is observed in intact peatlands (an erosional acrotelm). Antecedent water table elevation is a key control on the hydrological response to precipitation events, in particular runoff percent, the timing of peak discharges and maximum water table elevations. Significant discharge is generated whilst water table elevations are relatively tow at gully edge locations, and this has a strong influence on flow pathways. Four characteristics of runoff response are recognised: (i) the rapid development of macropore/pipe flow at the start of the storm; (ii) peat rewetting, water table elevation increase and continued macropore/pipe flow; (iii) maximum water table elevations and peak stream discharge with throughflow occurring within the erosional acrotelm and rapid flow through the subsurface macropore/pipe network; (iv) rapidly declining water table elevations and stream flow following the cessation of rainfall. Gully edge peats provide a key linkage between the hillslope hydrological system and channel flow so that their influence on the hydrological functioning of the peatlands is disproportionate to their aerial. extent within the catchment. Future climate change may lead to further degradation of the bogs and a reinforcement of the importance of erosion gullies to runoff generation and water quality. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB We studied 45 mid-boreal wetlands in a rugged land uplift coast with a thin cover of till. Wetlands ranged from 1 to 53 m a.s.l. and were of highly various sizes. Our aims were to examine, if vegetation types are valid in comparing wetlands, what kind of ecological major pattern the vegetation type composition of wetlands shows and how vegetation types distribute across altitudes. On those ground we discuss the wetland succession of the study area. We used the Finnish mire site types as vegetation types. Mire site types could be used for an ecological classification and ordination of the wetlands. As was expected, the major gradient consisted of the transition from mire margin (swamp) to expanse. The distribution of the Major Vegetational Wetland Groups (MVWG) responded to a general water-flow pattern in the landscape. Partly different peatland succession sequences occur in areas with small mire basins and in areas with larger mire basins with evolving mire complexes. Sequences of small wetlands and those of mire complexes follow the same trajectory only as far as the major gradient is considered while they differ with regard to the vegetation type composition of locally rare vegetation types and with regard to peatland morphology. Trajectories of mire complexes at catchment divides differ from those at catchment centers where the waters in the landscape tend to gather. Peatland forms of aapa mires experience a change reaching altitudes of 30-50 m a.s.l. Small bog complexes at catchment divides reach a stage of an unpatterned Sphagnum fuscum bog in the study area. Mature mixed complexes with aapa-mire parts and patterned sloping-bog parts only occur at altitudes higher than 60 m a.s.l. Peculiarities in the succession of the wetlands of Nyby, which include the presence of separate incomplete successional sequences in the same area, are mainly caused by the peculiar topography with various sub-areas and with an abundance of rock outcrops.

AB Ombrotrophic bogs can comprise a mosaic of vegetation patches and open-water pools, with hydrological and biogeochemical connections between pools and the surrounding peat and vegetation. To establish these connections, we studied the spatial heterogeneity of hydrology and water chemistry in two zones of distinct vegetation assemblages in the subboreal Grande plee Bleue peatland, southern Quebec, Canada. We show that seasonal water-level fluctuations are greater and organic C, N and P concentrations are higher in the peat pore water of a forested zone than in a neighboring open-bog zone; that vegetation is responsible for 69% of the spatial variations in hydrology and water chemistry. Vegetation also explains 31% of the temporal variation in water chemistry, with higher increases in C, N and P concentrations over the growing season in the forested peat and pools than in the open-bog zone. We also show that C, N and P concentrations and water-level fluctuations in pools, especially during precipitation events, were lower than in the surrounding peat. Our results suggest the existence of small "watersheds" to the pools with water flowing in during wet and out during dry periods. Localized patterns emerge from the vegetation-hydrology-water chemistry interactions, with pools influencing the persistence of trees in the central part of an ombrotrophic bog.

AB This study focusses on the ecology of testate amoeba species in peatlands of the southern taiga of Western Siberia. To estimate the influence of the trophic state of mires on species optima related to water table depth, a separate study of three calibration datasets including ombrotrophic, minerotrophic and the combined habitats was conducted. In the datasets obtained separately from ombrotrophic and minerotrophic mires, the water table depth was the main factor affecting testate amoeba assemblages. However, the trophic state (specifically pH and ash content) was more important factor in the combined dataset, including all of the studied mires. For 36 testate amoeba species, which were found in the ombrotrophic and minerotrophic mire habitats, their species optima, obtained separately in ombrotrophic and minerotrophic datasets, differed significantly from each other. Some of these species preferred minerotrophic conditions, while others preferred ombrotrophic ones. For all species, the trophic state of the mires affected the values of the species optima related to water table depth, as revealed in the form of a threshold effect. In extreme conditions, the species were more sensitive to the trophic status than to the water table depth, and their optimum related to water table depth was distorted. Variation of the optimum was observed in those species that inhabited both ombrotrophic and minerotrophic mires due to the fact that mires with a different trophic status were included in the training sets. The optima did not vary for species inhabiting only ombrotrophic or only minerotrophic mires.

AB In this paper concerned with soil water dynamics in a managed cutover peat field, the microscale hydrological processes and parameters governing water flow and storage through variably saturated peat are investigated. An open water ditch-reservoir enhanced wetting of adjacent cutover peat, maintaining the water table depth above 43 cm during the summer, surface soil moisture above 45%, and water tension in the surface layer above -45 mbar. Desaturation of pores was noted in the -2 and -10 cm depths, but at -30 and -50 cm a decrease in moisture content of several percent was associated with compression of the peat as the water table dropped. Air entry occurred only at pressures below -15 mbar. Seasonal subsidence resulted in cumulative vertical displacement in excess of 10 cm during the study period. Typical settlements in the peat ranged between 11 and 23% of the lowering of the water table. Considerable hysteresis was observed, and vertical displacement was 5 times greater in response to water loss, compared to rewetting. The specific storage (S-s) in the 180 cm thick deposit averaged 9.4 x 10(-4) cm(-1) during drying periods but averaged only 2.6 x 10-4 cm(-1) on rewetting. S-s was more important than specific yield (S-s) in the overall aquifer storativity. Transient hydraulic properties resulted from the shifting soil structure. The increase in peat bulk density caused by drying increased the water retention capacity and decreased hydraulic conductivity. Mean saturated hydraulic conductivity was 15 cm d(-1) and decreased 2 orders of magnitude as the degree of saturation dropped from 1 to 0.4. The horizontal/vertical anisotropy ratio was 4. The changing surface elevation in response to seasonal subsidence had a profound influence on the nature of the storage changes and hydraulic parameters of the peat soil.

AB Iron transport in soils amended with Fe-enriched farmyard manure (FYM), poultry manure (PM) and Huleh Valley peat (Peat) was studied in saturated soil columns under constant water flow rate.  The Fe concentration in the effluent varied with the type of the organic material, water soluble fraction (WSF) concentrations and the susceptibility of the WSF to chemical and microbial degradation.  Incubation of soils treated with the enriched organic materials significantly enhanced the levels of leachable Fe complexes in the case of the FYM and PM treatments which were easily subjected to biodegradation, whereas incubation of a soil with Fe-enriched peat resulted in minor effects.  Under a simulated drip irrigation regime (5 irrigation cycles during 104 days), DTPA extractable Fe concentration increased to a depth of 45 cm and to a horizontal distance of 30 cm from a point source of Fe enriched organic matter.  The Fe movement in the soil was attributed to mass-flow of water-soluble complexes which are partially present in the original organic material and partially formed by degradation processes.

AB In ombrotrophic peatlands, the moisture content of the vadose zone (acrotelm) controls oxygen diffusion rates, redox state, and the turnover of organic matter. Whether peatlands act as sinks or sources of atmospheric carbon thus relies on variably saturated flow processes. The Richards equation is the standard model for water flow in soils, but it is not clear whether it can be applied to simulate water flow in live Sphagnum moss. Transient laboratory evaporation experiments were conducted to observe evaporative water fluxes in the acrotelm, containing living Sphagnum moss, and a deeper layer containing decomposed moss peat. The experimental data were evaluated by inverse modeling using the Richards equation as process model for variably-saturated flow. It was tested whether water fluxes and time series of measured pressure heads during evaporation could be simulated. The results showed that the measurements could be matched very well providing the hydraulic properties are represented by a suitable model. For this, a trimodal parametrization of the underlying pore-size distribution was necessary which reflects three distinct pore systems of the Sphagnum constituted by inter-, intra-, and inner-plant water. While the traditional van Genuchten-Mualem model led to great discrepancies, the physically more comprehensive Peters-Durner-Iden model which accounts for capillary and noncapillary flow, led to a more consistent description of the observations. We conclude that the Richards equation is a valid process description for variably saturated moisture fluxes over a wide pressure range in peatlands supporting the conceptualization of the live moss as part of the vadose zone.

AB Hydrology controls the physical, chemical and biological processes in peatlands and hence could be the most important process regulating their function, development and characteristic biogeochemistry. Models describing hydrological processes and soil heat exchange phenomena are an important tool in understanding the peatland biogeochemical cycles of C and N. Presented in this paper is a peat soil climate model that uses weather data, mire site and peat characteristics as input data. The model is related to the heterogeneous peat characteristics (e.g. bulk density, degree of humification, remains of Sphagnum, Carex, Eriophorum and woody tissues), which in turn vary with depth. Evapotranspiration is related to weather parameters and tree stand characteristics. The model simulations were validated against the observed data collected during 1993 and 1994 growing seasons at a fen and bog sites at the Lakkasuo mire complex located in central Finland. The observed and simulated day-to-day variations in water table levels and soil temperatures during both seasons appeared overall to be in phase. As the model lacks the data needed to characterize the peat matrix hysteresis, the model was found lacking in response to wetting and drying cycles. The mean differences between simulated and observed water table levels during 1994 were -0.3 +/- 1.3 and -0.5 +/- 2.3 cm for the fen and bog sites, respectively. The model was found to be sensitive to mire surface characteristics and evapotranspiration, particularly for the bog site with an unsaturated zone deeper than at the fen. The absolute mean differences between the simulated and measured peat temperatures from 5 to 150 cm, were less than 1.0 degrees C with a maximal standard deviation of 1.6 degrees C. The model deviations for the upper layers showed larger variations compared to deeper layers, implying a greater accuracy in defining the lower boundary of the thermal regime within the peat column.

AB To clarify the nutrient dynamics in peat-covered watersheds during frost, soil, chemical properties of atmospheric deposition (bulk deposition and throughfall) on mires, peat pore water, and stream-water outflows from mires were investigated at three ombrogenous mires with Picea glehnii M. forests and Sphagnum spp. communities in Ochiishi, eastern Hokkaido, Japan. We investigated the depth of frozen ground as one of the factors determining chemical properties of outflowing stream water from mires. Na+ and Cl- were the dominant ion species in bulk deposition and throughfall, implying the influence of sea salts on precipitation chemistry. The electrical conductivity (EC) and Na+, Mg2+ Ca2+, Cl-, and SO42- concentrations in throughfall (snow) were 5-10 times higher than bulk deposition after a 25-day period without precipitation in February 2001. Throughfall was enriched with sea salts from dry deposition on the canopy, while snow was intercepted by the forest canopy. The first rain event during the seasonal soil freezing led to the enrichment of chemical components in the stream-water outflows from the mire. The frozen layer in the upper peat soil prevented the infiltration of snow melt into peat soil during the period of frost soil, and hence large amounts of salts (Na+ and Cl-) accumulated on the snow surface or within the snow cover. Rain water flowed over the frost soil layer and was enriched with chemicals from accumulated salts in the snow cover. This subsequently led to the high salt concentration in stream water just after the rain events during the season when soil was frozen.

AB The habitat of low growing, herbaceous rich-fen vegetation (Caricion davallianae) is now threatened throughout Western Europe. Its conservation, restoration and even recreation receives increasing attention. In the Campine area of Belgium a rich fen, that depends entirely on an artificial river water infiltration system for its alkaline discharge, is present. The rich fen vegetation cannot be older then a century, i.e. the age of the infiltration system. This illustrates that poor-fen precursors can be transformed into rich fen by alkaline ground-water discharge. The possibilities for restoration and the difficulties with use of allochtonous water for nature conservation are discussed. Finally, the hydrochemical consequences of the alkaline discharge in the fen soil are considered: in dry summers periodical acidification of the peat soils occurs.

AB Siberian mires, especially the world's largest coherent bogs of the Great Vasyugan Mire (Tomsk Region, West Siberian Plain, Russia), play an important role in the regional hydrological cycle, global carbon balance and influence flow formation of the region's rivers. We revealed the role of natural mires in supplying water to a mire-dominated (80% of the river basin area) Siberian catchment of the Klyuch River that represents typical features of the headwater catchment of the Great Vasyugan Mire, the world's largest mire in natural and well-preserved conditions. Our research protocol involved an analysis of the electric conductivity of peat water along selected transects of the mire, analysis of groundwater levels and river discharge and electric conductivity of the river water. We used ground-penetrating radar to determine the structure of the peat. We revealed that the examined part of the mire depends solely on the rainwater supply and that minerotrophic groundwater is not present within the area of the research. Average groundwater levels within the mire in the period 2013-2018 reached 0.193 m b.g.l. We also revealed that the natural drainage of mire water does not sustain river discharge throughout the whole year. This means the Klyuch remains an intermittent river dependent on the natural outflow of the mire's waters, after exceeding the mire's critical water retention volume. Total retention volume of a mire depends on the peat's physical features and the mire's short-term response to excessive thaw and precipitation events. An analysis of river discharge duration curves demonstrated that river discharge can be sustained by the duration reaching from 0.39 up to 0.71 in a year, in dry and wet years, respectively. We concluded that in a specific hydrogeological setup of the mire-river system, natural ombrotrophic mires cannot be considered as systems with a continuous water supply and discharge stabilization. We concluded that the Hortonian vision of infiltration and discharge is not valid in bog dominated basins. In the face of climatic changes in Siberia, we foresee a decrease in the discharge volume from the headwaters of rivers and the increase of river intermittence which may affect total outflow volume, specifically in the upper Ob and Irtysh, by reducing the contribution of surface runoff.

AB 1 Landsat imagery was used to map the distribution of 127 raised bogs in northwestern Minnesota. Bogs collectively cover 1236 km(2) (16% of the study area) despite the relatively dry regional climate and periodic droughts.
   2 The physical, chemical, and biotic properties of these bogs have no apparent relationship to the westward climatic gradient indicating a high degree of buffering from changes in moisture stress.
   3 Most bogs are located where groundwater discharge moderates moisture losses to the atmosphere and may decouple bogs from a direct climatic control. Bogs are also consistently related to physiographic features, such as drainage divides, interfluves of tributary streams, and beach ridges that constrain the surface and groundwater hydrology.
   4 During droughts groundwater moves upward through the peat column toward the depressed water table, which is located 1-2 m below the peat surface. During moist periods, however, water-table mounds within these bogs drive surface water downward deflecting the deeper upwardly moving groundwater laterally to the bog margins.
   5 Such short-term reversals in flow have little effect on the pore-water chemistry of major cations, which reflect the predominant downward flow over the past decade. Several chemical species, however, behave nonconservatively and respond more directly to climatic change.
   6 Discharge zones for groundwater seem to be an essential prerequisite for bog formation in arid regions. Feat accumulation should be most rapid over discharge zones, which can maintain water table mounds, even during droughts Once a peat mound has formed, its higher water table will drive local recharge cells, which isolate the vegetation from groundwater and facilitate the development of a raised bog.

DE ACIDIFICATION; ALKALINITY; CARICION-DAVALLIANAE; RICH FEN
AB The soil chemistry of a headwater valley fen is influenced by local ground water discharge that supplies base cations and alkalinity to the fen.  An irrigation canal just upward of the fen is the source of this alkalinity.  The ecological consequences of this artificial system are studied both on the soil and vegetation level.  Rich-fen species of the alliance Caricion davallianae are connected to soil water alkalinity and soil base status.  They depend directly on the alkaline ground water discharge.  In addition, the local input of this water causes a gradient-rich pattern from poor to rich fen, and it is therefore concluded that it is responsible for the presence of intermediate fen vegetation too.  High nutrient levels in the irrigation water have not influenced the fen until now.  This case study illustrates the possibility for rich fen restoration after acidification.  Irrigation with alkaline water is efficient if excess nutrients can be removed.

AB Water table depth in peatlands is strongly linked to physical properties of the peat, such as density (rho(dry)), peat composition and humification, hydraulic conductivity (K), and specific yield (S-y). Dry bulk density and peat depth are commonly used as indicators of K in ecohydrological models. However, no mathematical relationship exists to quantify S-y based on K and rho(dry). As a result, ecohydrological models cannot explicitly reproduce the strong buffering capacity of peatlands. The objectives of this study were to analyse the literature-reported mathematical link between all the physical properties to develop new mathematical relationships between these parameters and to evaluate whether variations in the physical properties of the peat control water table depth in peatlands. Seven peatlands located in the St. Lawrence Lowlands (Quebec, Canada) were sampled, and 1 m long peat cores were collected from up-gradient, mid-gradient, and down-gradient zones. All cores were used to measure rho(dry), K, S-y, and to estimate peat composition and humification. Statistically significant correlations were found between (a) K and S-y (log-log model), (b) K and depth (log-log model), (c) S-y and depth (log-log model), (d) rho(dry) and S-y (log model), and (e) rho(dry) and K (log model). No significant difference was found in either K or S-y between sites. However, significant differences were found in water table depths. Because they provide a fuller description of the peat properties that control water table depths, these newly developed functions have the potential to improve the capacity of ecohydrological models to simulate time-varying hydrological conditions.

AB The mineralogy of three back-barrier peat marshes (Torreblanca, Benicasim and Moncofar marshes) from Eastern Spain and one peat bog (Orihuela del Tremedal bog) from central east Spain have been investigated, using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electronic microscope (SEM) techniques. A combination of XRD methods was used to quantify the mineralogy of dried bulk peat samples.
   The water source in the peat marshes is both continental and marine. Water is highly mineralised. Water flow is both low and slow (accumulative system). The water source in the peat bog is continental, draining from the hill. The higher concentration of ions in the water of the back-barrier peat marshes leads to a higher concentration of authigenic minerals in the peat marshes compared to the peat bog.
   Three main mineral origins have been recognized, namely: detrital, syngenetic-epigenetic and biogenic. The more important contribution comes from the detrital system.
   Biogenic and bio-influenced minerals are the main non-detrital minerals in the peatlands. This paper discusses the biogenic origin of halite (and other minor halides and sulphates, such as, sylvite, carnalite, epsomite, glauberite, mirabilite and anhydrite?) from halophytic plants, as well as amorphous silica (opal-A) from sponge spicules and phytoliths of several plants.
   Pyrite in the peat bog has both syngenetic and epigenetic origins from plant decomposition and sulphur release. In the peat marsh the pyrite has a syngenetic origin from sulphate reduction (S-sulphate -> S-pyritic and an epigenetic origin in the older peat, from plant decomposition (S-organic -> S-pyritic).

AB 1. Discoloration of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tape has been used in peatland ecological and hydrological studies as an inexpensive way to monitor changes in water-table depth and reducing conditions.
   2. We investigated the relationship between depth of PVC tape discoloration and measured water-table depth at monthly time steps during the growing season within nine kettle peatlands of northern Wisconsin. Our specific objectives were to: (1) determine if PVC discoloration is an accurate method of inferring water-table depth in Sphagnum-dominated kettle peatlands of the region; (2) assess seasonal variability in the accuracy of the method; and (3) determine if systematic differences in accuracy occurred among microhabitats, PVC tape colour and peatlands.
   3. Our results indicated that PVC tape discoloration can be used to describe gradients of water-table depth in kettle peatlands. However, accuracy differed among the peatlands studied, and was systematically biased in early spring and late summer/autumn. Regardless of the month when the tape was installed, the highest elevations of PVC tape discoloration showed the strongest correlation with midsummer (around July) water-table depth and average water-table depth during the growing season.
   4. The PVC tape discoloration method should be used cautiously when precise estimates are needed of seasonal changes in the water-table.

AB In this article the results of a study on hummock-hollow complexes on Clara bog (Co, Offaly, Ireland) are presented.  The present size of the bog is the result of peat-cutting, road-building and drainage.  These activities influenced the hydrology of the western side of the bog, where the main flow of water is in a south-easterly direction.  Specific distribution patterns of nutrients are found, with PO4(3-), NO2(-), NH4+ NA+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Al3+, Zn2+ and Pb2+ having low concentrations in the centre of the bog and higher ones towards the edges; only SO4(2-) shows a reverse pattern.  General descriptions of three ombrotrophic and seven minerotrophic vegetation types are given.  Hummock-hollow complexes are found on plateaus on the bog where water flow is reduced.  A transect study of hummock-hollow complexes revealed that the distribution of Sphagnum species is best explained by the height of the moss surface above the water-table.  Other important ecofactors are the concentrations of Ca2+, Mn2+ and PO4(3-).  Since the hydraulic conductivity is high in the acrotelm, the water-table acts as a plane below the microtopographical elements.  Ecotope breadth and overlap calculations for height above the water-table showed that both extremes of the gradient are occupied by specialists while the slope is occupied by generalists.  Similar calculations for PO4(3-), Mn2+ and Ca2+ showed that Sphagnum species did not compete for them.  This suggests that these ecofactors are dependent on the physical and chemical properties of the hummock-hollow structure.  Analysis of nutrient concentrations in Sphagnum plants showed that the relative composition reflects the supply by wet deposition.  The absolute amounts, however, are determined by the physiological properties of the individual species.

AB The proposed harvesting of previously undeveloped forests in north coastal British Columbia requires an understanding of hydrological responses. Hydrometric and isotopic techniques were used to examine the hydrological linkages between meteoric inputs to the surface-groundwater system and runoff response patterns of a forest-peatland complex. Quickflow accounted for 72-91% of peak storm discharge. The runoff ratio was lowest for open peatland areas with thick organic horizons (0.02-0.05) due to low topographic gradients and many surface depressions capable of retaining surface water. Runoff ratio increased comparatively for ephemeral surface seep flows (0.06-0.40) and was greatest in steeply sloping forest communities with more permeable soils (0.33-0.69). The dominant mechanism for runoff generation was saturated shallow subsurface flow. Groundwater fluxes from the organic horizon of seeps (1.70-1.72 m(3) day(-1) m(-1)) were an important component of quickflow. The homogeneous delta H-2-delta O-18 composition of groundwater indicated attenuation of the seasonal rainfall signal by mixing during recharge. The positive correlation (r(2) = 0.64 and 0.38, alpha = 0.05) between slope index and delta O-18 values in groundwater suggests that the spatial pattern in the 8180 composition along the forest-peatland complex is influenced by topography and provides evidence that topographic indices may be used to predict groundwater residence time.

AB As Part III of a four-part series on the filter function of peat for uranium (U), this paper focuses on the hydraulic component of a conceptual filter model introduced in Part II. This includes the quantification of water flow through the wetland as a whole, which was largely unknown and found to be significantly higher that anticipated. Apart from subaquatic artesian springs associated with the underlying karst aquifer the higher flow volumes were also caused by plumes of polluted groundwater moving laterally into the wetland. Real-time, quasi-continuous in situ measurements of porewater in peat and non-peat sediments indicate that rising stream levels (e.g., during flood conditions) lead to the infiltration of stream water into adjacent peat deposits and thus allow for a certain proportion of flood water to be filtered. However, changes in porewater quality triggered by spring rains may promote the remobilization of possibly sorbed U.

AB We reconstructed peatland formation, succession and long-term rates of carbon (C) accumulation at a mid-elevation poor fen on Vancouver Island in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Multi-proxy paleoecological analyses including bulk chemistry, peat composition, macrofossils, pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs show terrestrialization starting from a small oligotrophic lake 14,000 cal BP. Peat accumulation began by 11,600 cal BP with the transition to an emergent Nuphar-dominated shallow-water marsh. Terrestrialization in the center of the peatland was more or less complete by 10,400 cal BP with the development of a Sphagnum-dominated poor fen that continues to the present. Outward expansion by paludification appears to have brought the peatland close to its modern lateral extent by 10,000 cal BP, suggesting that terrestrialization and paludification played important concurrent roles in the early development of this poor fen. Mean long-term rates of C accumulation (13 g C/m(2)/yr) are lower than at most Northern Hemisphere peatlands including nearby lowland bogs. Maximum rates of 43 g C/m(2)/yr occurred in the early Holocene during accumulation of Nuphar peat and the transition to Sphagnum peat and coincided with high summer temperatures and increased seasonality, which promote growing season productivity and reduce winter decomposition. Early Holocene increases in C accumulation rates occurred at two nearby lowland bogs during similar wetland stages. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that climate and autogenic succession, including changes in relative water table depth and plant functional groups, interacted to drive Holocene peatland dynamics and C accumulation rates in the maritime setting of coastal British Columbia.

AB Suspended sediment and nutrient loadings from agricultural watersheds have lead to habitat degradation in Lake Takkobu. To examine their relationships with land-use activities, we monitored sediment, nutrient and water discharges into the lake for a 1-year sampling period. The Takkobu River contributed the largest portion of the annual water discharge into the lake, compared with the other tributaries. During dry conditions, lake water flowed into the Kushiro River, and conversely during flooding, Kushiro River water flowed into the lake. Inflows from the Kushiro River had a high proportion of inorganic matter, with high concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus, attributed to agricultural land-use development and stream channelization practiced since the 1960s in the Kushiro Mire. Nutrient loadings from these two rivers were significantly higher during flooding than in dry conditions. However, there was no clear correlation between river discharge and nutrient concentrations. Since land-use activities in the Kushiro River and Takkobu River watersheds were concentrated near rivers, nutrients easily entered the drainage system under low flow conditions. In contrast, water discharged from small, forest-dominated watersheds contained a low proportion of inorganic matter, and low nutrient concentrations. The suspended sediment delivered to the lake during the sample period was estimated as approximately 607 tons, while the total nitrogen and total phosphorus inflows were about 10,466 and 1,433 kg, respectively. Suspended sediment input into the lake was 65%, and total nitrogen and total phosphorus were 40% and 48%, respectively, being delivered by the Kushiro River.

AB Hydrological disturbances can alter the structure and function of ecosystems by changing plant species composition over time. Peatlands in the northern hemisphere are particularly sensitive to global change drivers related to soil water availability, such as drought and drainage, because of important ecohydrological feedbacks between species composition and water table position. Here, we examined the plant community structure and environmental drivers of species distributions over two growing seasons along a bog margin gradient, pre- and post-disturbance by beaver activity. Pond drainage resulted in seasonal average water table depth 8-24 cm lower in the second season. Five plant communities corresponded to changes in water table depth and acidity: bog, poor fen, meadow, mudflat and pond. Plant cover increased in meadow and mudflat communities, decreased in the pond community and did not differ between years in bog and poor fen communities. Changes in species abundance between years showed signs of alternate successional pathways: one that favors Sphagnum moss and bog community expansion and another pathway that favors meadow and mudflat expansion. This study highlights the non-linear successional trajectory of plant communities with changes in water table depth, which has implications for land management goals that aim to conserve the ecological integrity of peatland ecosystems.

AB Stratigraphic relationships, radiocarbon dating, sediment and peat characteristics, and rates of peat and carbon accumulation from a soligenous peatland, or "bofedal," in the Chilean Altiplano shows the peatland to be unusually young, dynamic, and sensitive to environmental changes. The site lies in the National Park Nevado de Tres Cruces in the puna desert grassland at an elevation of 4300 m a.s.l. Eight peat cores were extracted from a 1.75-km transect yielding a maximum of 3.6 in of organic sediment. Organic matter began to accumulate 1700-1100 cal yr B.P. under a progressively and local climate, after a period when regional climate is believed to have been more humid than at present. Areas of greater relief and better drainage in the valley bottom eventually fostered the growth of a riparian cushion plant community after water flowing down the valley began to diminish. This led to rapid lateral expansion of the riparian peatland communities over open water in topographic depressions at a rate heretofore unprecedented in the peatland literature. It appears that development of the peatland has been encouraged by autoregulation of internal hydrology. The drainage impediment created by organic mass accumulation in lower-relief areas probably reduced the amount of water arriving at the lower reaches of the peatland. These areas have become progressively drier and have since died and oxidized. Through endogenous peat accumulation and a concomitant drainage impediment, the ecosystem has been migrating upstream over the past 50 years. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB It is well established that in ombrotrophic bogs, water-table depth (WTD) is the primary environmental control on testate amoeba distribution. However, the environmental controls on testate amoebae in minerotrophic fens are less well known and successional change in their assemblages associated with fen-bog peatland development has been scarcely investigated. Here we investigate a peatland space-for-time sequence resulting from postglacial rebound on the west coast of Finland, to assess successional patterns in testate amoeba communities and their relationships with environmental variables during peatland development. Sample sites along a 10-km transect from coast to inland ranged from a recently emerged wet meadow to a mature bog. Environmental variables (e.g., peat thickness, carbon and nitrogen content, pH, WTD and vegetation) were measured alongside testate amoeba samples. Results showed that even though the distribution of testate amoebae was to some extent determined by the succession stage, many taxa had wide WTD and pH ranges. The primary environmental control for many taxa changed along the succession. In conclusion, the ecological constraints on testate amoebae in minerotrophic systems are more complex than in bogs. The detected patterns also complicate the use of testate amoebae as a primary proxy in palaeoecological reconstructions where fen-to-bog shifts occur. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands in the western boreal plains of Canada are important ecosystems as they store over two percent of global terrestrial carbon. However, in recent decades, many of these peatlands have been fragmented by access roads constructed for resource extraction and transportation, challenging their carbon storage potential. To investigate how roads have been impacting tree and shrub growth and productivity in these peatlands, this study was conducted in a forested bog and woody fen in Carmon Creek, Alberta, Canada. In 2017, vegetation surveys were conducted along 20 m transects that extended on both sides of the road with 4 m(2)circular plots at 2, 6 and 20 m distance from the road and were followed by disc or core collection from woody stems. Within 20 m of the road at the bog site, we observed a shift towards significantly larger radial growth of trees in the downstream areas (t= 3.23,p= 0.006) where water table position was deeper, while at the fen site, radial growth of tall shrubs had little response to the road. Combining the effects of direct tree clearing and hydrology induced shifts in growth, aboveground net primary productivity (NPPag) post-road construction was reduced significantly in areas where vegetation was cleared during the road construction (i.e., upstream areas of the bog:t= 5.21,p< 0.0001 and downstream areas of the fen:t= 2.64,p= 0.07). Substantially lower NPPag around the road construction areas compared to reference areas shows tremendous loss of carbon sink potential of trees and shrubs after road construction through peatlands. Altogether, roads constructed through peatlands perpendicular to the water flow may shift long-term carbon sinks into sources of carbon, at least for the initial few years following road construction.

AB Numerous palaeoecological studies have used testate amoeba analysis to reconstruct Holocene hydrological change in peat lands, and thereby past climatic change. Current studies have been almost exclusively restricted to ombrotrophic bogs and the period since the fen bog transition. Although the critical link between peatland surface wetness and climate is less direct in minerotrophic peatlands, such records may still be of value where there are few others, particularly if multiple records can be derived and inter-compared. Expanding the temporal and spatial scope of testate amoeba-based palaeohydrology to minerotrophic peatlands requires studies to establish the primacy of hydrology and the efficacy of transfer functions across a range of sites. This study analyses testate amoeba data from wetlands spanning the trophic gradient in the eastern Mediterranean region. Results demonstrate that different types of wetlands have distinctly different amoeba communities, but hydrology remains the most important environmental control (despite water table depth being measured at different times for different sites). Interestingly, Zn and Fe emerge as significant environmental variables in a subset of sites with geochemical data. Testate amoeba hydrology transfer functions perform well in cross-validation but frequently perform poorly when applied to other sites, particularly with sites of a different nutrient status. It may be valid to use testate amoebae to reconstruct hydrological change from minerotrophic peatlands with an applicable transfer function; however, it may not be appropriate to use testate amoebae to reconstruct hydrological change through periods of ecosystem evolution, particularly the fen bog transition. In practice, the preservation of amoeba shells is likely to be a key problem for palaeoecological reconstruction from fens. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This study retraced the fate of phosphorus (P) applied to various types of afforested cutaway peatlands and examined the spatial and temporal trends in the concentration of soluble molybdate reactive phosphorus (MRP) in surface runoff water and soil water. Edaphic characteristics had a critical role to play in the occurrence of P loss. The occurrence and magnitude of P loss also depended on the rate and method of application of the fertilizer and transport factors such as surface runoff, which is directly related to hydrological processes and climatic conditions. Due to low P-binding capacity, immediate P loss is inevitable from newly fertilized deep peat unless edaphic properties can be altered, e.g. by mixing the peat with calcareous sub-peat mineral soil. P loss can be reduced by (1) applying the initial fertilizer in band rather than broadcast, (2) splitting in two applications and applying the minimum rate of fertilizer necessary at planting, and (3) establishing a vegetation cover. The fate of lost P is still unknown as low MRP concentrations were recorded in the drain water two years after fertilization. Finally, P losses have been confirmed to be temporary as no P losses were recorded in plantations which had been established and fertilized ten years previously.

We measured the chemical properties of peat pore water and precipitation both in the P. glehnii forest and the Sphagnum community and found that the forest acidifies the peat and accumulates sea salt deposited by precipitation. Picea glehnii grows in soils that have a higher salt concentration than the Sphagnum communities. We measured a stem flow salt concentration that was higher than the bulk deposition. The salt concentration in precipitation and peat pore water decreased with increasing distance from the coastline. These results imply that atmospheric sea salt deposition is effectively trapped by the P. glehnii canopy, and it then contributes to the accumulation of salt and the consequent acidification within the peat. Stem-flow water was more acidic than bulk deposition or throughfall within the P. glehnii forests. This means that acids are dissolved while precipitation runs through on the bark of P. glehnii, and then the acids are transferred and accumulate in the peat. The chemical modification of precipitation by P. glehnii makes the soil chemical environment more acidic than the Sphagnum community that usually makes the soil environment acidic in a peat mire ecosystem.

AB Wetlands provide unique goods and services, as habitats of high biodiversity. Hydrology is the principal control on wetland functioning; hence, understanding the water source is fundamental. However, groundwater inflows may be discrete and easily missed. Research techniques are required with low cost and minimal impact in sensitive settings. In this study, the effectiveness of using a three-dimensional (3D) temperature model and botanical indicators to characterise groundwater discharge is explored at the CEH (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology) River Lambourn Observatory, Boxford, UK. This comprises a 10 ha lowland riparian wetland, designated for its scientific interest and conservation value. Temperature data were collected in winter at multiple depths down to 0.9 m over approximately 3.6 ha and transformed into a 3D model via ordinary kriging. Anomalous warm zones indicated distinct areas of groundwater upwelling which were concurrent with relic channel structures. Lateral heat propagation from the channels was minimal and restricted to within 5-10 m. Vertical temperature sections within the channels suggest varying degrees of groundwater discharge along their length. Hydrochemical analysis showed that warmer peat waters were akin to deeper aquifer waters, confirming the temperature anomalies as areas of groundwater discharge. Subsequently, a targeted vegetation survey identified Carex paniculata as an indicator of groundwater discharge. The upwelling groundwater contains high concentrations of nitrate which is considered to support the spatially restricted growth of Carex paniculata against a background of poor fen communities located in reducing higher-phosphate waters.

AB Evapotranspiration rates (ET) from contrasting Wisconsin bogs (one forested bog, one open bog) were compared over 4 years by analyzing diel oscillations of their water tables. Daily rates of ET from peatlands were also compared to rates of evaporation (E) from encircled bog ponds. We hypothesized that ET would be higher in the forested bog due to the greater leaf area index of forest canopy relative to moss and ericaceous shrubs. We also hypothesized that ET in peatlands would exceed the physical process of E from encircled ponds. Field data supported the first hypothesis, but the second only proved true for the forested peatland. Daily estimates of peatland ET varied widely, ranging from similar to 1 to > 10 mm/d; but average ET was higher in the forested peatland (4.04 vs. 3.09 mm/d; p < .01). Average ET in the forested peatland was also higher than E during summer (4.04 vs. 3.31 mm/d; p <.05); whereas in the open peatland, average ET was slightly lower than E for all measured seasons (p <.01). Methodologically, the performance of three equations used to estimate ET from daily water table fluctuations was similar. The specific yield of peat (S*y), which is a critical variable in all three equations, was found to be an exponential function of water table depth; and absent an empirically derived S*y, errors in estimates of peatland ET can be large. Given landscape composition across this northern temperate region (13% lakes, 20% peatland, and 54% upland forest) and estimates of forest ET gleaned from the literature, our findings suggest that the regional feedback of water to the atmosphere increases from open waters to peatlands to upland forest, consistent with prior observations that the biological process of transpiration dominates continental ET.

AB A laboratory investigation was used to determine whether biogenic gas bubbles accumulate and block water-conducting pores below the water table in poorly decomposed Sphagnum peat. We found that biogenic gas bubbles did accumulate under realistic incubation temperatures. At the end of incubations at 10.5 degreesC, volumetric water contents in two peat samples decreased to between 0.8 and 0.85 (porosity of the samples ranged from 0.96 to 0.97), indicating that the peat was considerably undersaturated with respect to water. Methane was found to be an important constituent of the gas bubbles. The presence of gas bubbles appeared to have a major effect on hydraulic conductivity (K). In control incubations, prior to which the peat had been irradiated and dosed with a biocide, biogenic gas bubbles did not accumulate, and K was 5-8 times higher than at the end of the microbially active incubations. Our results suggest that biogenic gas bubbles have a potentially significant effect on seepage in peat soils.

AB Mires and peatlands in general are heavily influenced by anthropogenic stressors like acidification, eutrophication, desiccation and fragmentation. Groundwater-fed mires are, in contrast to rainwater-fed mires, often well protected against desiccation due to constant groundwater discharge. Groundwater-fed mires can however be influenced by groundwater pollution such as groundwater nitrate enrichment, a threat which has received minor attention in literature. The present case study demonstrates how groundwater nitrate enrichment can affect the biogeochemical functioning and vegetation composition of groundwater-fed mires through direct nitrogen enrichment and indirect nitrate-induced sulphate mobilisation from geological deposits. Biogeochemical and ecohydrological analyses suggest that the Dutch groundwater-fed mire studied is influenced by different water sources (rainwater; groundwater of local and regional origin) with differing chemical compositions. The weakly buffered and nitrate-enriched groundwater leads, where it reaches the uppermost peat, to nitrogen enrichment, enhanced isotopic nitrogen signatures and altered the vegetation composition at the expense of characteristic species. Nitrate-induced sulphate mobilisation in the aquifer led to enhanced sulphate reduction, sulphide toxicity and elemental sulphur deposition in the mire. Despite sulphate reduction and nitrate enrichment, internal eutrophication did not play an important role, due to relatively low phosphorus concentrations and/or low iron-bound phosphorus of the peat soil. Future management of groundwater-fed mires in nitrate-polluted aquifers should include the reduction of nitrate leaching to the aquifer at the recharge areas by management and ecohydrological restoration measures on both a local and landscape scale.

AB Milled peat, an important energy resource in Ireland, is produced by scaritying the surface of a peat bog and allowing the resultant particulate material to air dry prior to storage in large stockpiles on the peat bogs. The storage period can vary from 6 months to several years, during which time the stockpiles are subject to atmospheric precipitation which causes rewetting and a subsequent reduction in calorific and monetary value. A study was undertaken to characterise the pore structure of stockpiles and identify relationships between structure and propensity to rewet. Recent research examining rewetting mechanisms in milled peat stockpiles has focused mainly on macroscale physical data. With respect to the importance of the structure of a porous medium for water movement and storage, a characterisation of the pore and particulate structure of milled peat in stockpile was conducted using micromorphological techniques. Samples with water contents up to 0.6 g g(-1) were impregnated in the field. Thin sections produced in days as opposed to months (no period of chemical dehydration was required) were used to quantify macroporous structures using image analysis. Results illustrated that a significant hydraulic discontinuity existed between the surface and subsurface layers of stockpiles, a factor not identified by laboratory physical analysis. This endorsed the current hypothesis in that the milled pears of different genetic origin had different pore architectures which had a significant effect on the active rewetting mechanisms. The visualisation of water flow pathways using dye tracers suggested that in addition to the wetting front water movement, by-pass flow was an active rewetting mechanism. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB We carried out an eco-hydrological analysis to evaluate the most important effects of land use changes on the hydrological functioning of a fen system in Poland. We measured water levels (hydraulic heads) and water flow along a transect through the study area and also analysed land use changes using historical maps. Major hydrological changes occurred after c. 1950 when a dense drainage network was constructed and in the last decade when large fishponds were built. Nowadays, water levels in most of the fens and fen meadows are too low and the fluctuations too large for a long-term preservation of fen ecosystems. The mean water tables range from 0.3 to 0.8 m below soil surface with fluctuations from 0.7 up to 1.5 m. A second important cause of the hydrological changes of the system was the afforestation of the adjacent infiltration areas leading to increased evapotranspiration and a decreased groundwater flow to the wetlands. Finally, a recent increase in groundwater abstraction for agricultural purposes has probably lowered the groundwater even further. We conclude that a full restoration of the fen is not possible under the present conditions. An alternative restoration goal could be conservation and restoration of species-rich fen meadows, but also then improving the hydrological conditions will be necessary. While the focus is often on the local factors influencing the restoration prospects of a fen system, the regional processes are at least equally important. In this paper we discuss an importance of both local and regional factors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peat cores from boreal bog and fen sites in the Hudson Bay Lowlands of Northern Ontario, Canada, were analysed to calculate Holocene carbon accumulation rates, and to show how testate amoeba taxonomic assemblages, inferred depths to water table, and four morpho-traits that may be linked to function (mixotrophy, aperture size, aperture position, and biovolume) changed since peatland initiation. Carbon accumulation rates were on average higher for the Holocene in the fen record (19.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) in comparison with the bog record (15.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), which underwent a fen-to-bog transition around 6900 cal yr BP. Changes in rates of carbon accumulation were most strongly driven by changes in rates of peat vertical accretion, with more rapid rates in the fen record. Carbon accumulation rates were highest following peatland initiation when reconstructed water tables were highest, and in the late Holocene, when water table positions were variable. Taxa with larger biovolumes and apertures were generally more abundant when reconstructed water tables were higher, most notably following peatland initiation. Mixotrophic taxa were more prevalent in drier conditions and in the bog record. Changing frequencies of morpho-traits suggest that testate amoebae may occupy a higher trophic position in the microbial food web during wetter periods, signaling the possibility of internal feedbacks between peatland ecohydrology and critical ecosystem functions including long-term carbon accumulation.

AB This study compares hydrologic investigations of four New York fens designed to characterize spatial variability in groundwater flow (GWF) and the resulting hydrochemical patterns that influence plant nutrient availability. At the mart fen and two rich fen sites, hydrometric data and pore water samples collected from nested piezometers set along the GWF-path showed spatial patterns consistent with a mixing gradient established by the intersection of local (i.e., hill slope), relatively dilute groundwater discharge and mineral-rich groundwater discharged from a larger-scaled (i.e., intermediate) system. Distinct redox and carbonate gradients along the GWF-paths of three rich fens reflected strong interactions between groundwater supply of terminal electron acceptors and microbial processes affecting speciation of iron, nitrogen and phosphorus. Decreased nitrate concentrations, increased dissolved iron, and removal of sulfate along flowpaths indicated that redox conditions became more reduced as groundwater moved down-gradient. Nitrate removal occurred across the interface between the upland mineral soil and the organic-rich fen peat. Lack of ammonium accumulation indicated that denitrification limits N-supply to plants in down-gradient fen areas. Further down-gradient, sulfate-enriched groundwater discharge sustained sub-oxic conditions and enhanced phosphorus mobility through effects on iron-sulfur-phosphorus dynamics, alkalinity generation, and dissolution of mineral-bound P. In contrast, the poor fen was sustained by an isolated surficial groundwater system; a thick lacustrine clay aquitard limited intermediate or regional-scaled groundwater discharge. As a result, water table fluctuations were more responsive to short-term weather events and imposed the strongest influence on redox status. A redox gradient, evidenced by increasing iron and ammonium concentrations, extended downward with depth from the aerated peat surface. The dilute water supply and tack of additional internal alkalinity generation limited buffer capacity and decomposition. Overall, ammonium accumulation increased N-availability whereas reduced decomposition rates further limited P availability. Our results show that interaction of multiple GWF systems within the fens was the critical determinant of water table stability (rich fens) or fluctuation (poor fen), as well as the supply of dissolved ions that influence geochemical processes affecting plant nutrient availability. Together these factors accounted directly or indirectly for observed spatial patterns in redox and alkalinity gradients, which in turn controlled speciation of phosphorus-reactive minerals. Differences among fens in spatial patterns could be accounted for by differences in the geomorphometry of the basins within which the fens developed and the stratigraphy and hydraulic characteristics of underlying sediments. Results suggest that Fe-S dynamics, rather than carbonate precipitation, likely influences inorganic phosphorus pools and release mechanisms. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Oribatid mites are primarily terrestrial. Only about 90 species (less than 1% of all known oribatid species) from 10 genera are truly aquatic, with reproduction and all stages of their life cycle living in freshwater. Adaptation to aquatic conditions evolved independently in different taxa. However, many terrestrial species can also be found in aquatic habitats, either as chance stragglers from the surrounding habitats, or from periodic or unpredictable floodings, where they can survive for long periods. In spite of their low species richness aquatic oribatids can be very abundant in different freshwater habitats as in lentic (pools, lakes, water-filled microhabitats) or flowing waters (springs, rivers, streams), mainly on submerged plants. The heavily sclerotized exoskeletons of several species enables subfossil or fossil preservation in lakes or bog sediments.

AB This study compared dry matter production, nutrient uptake and tissue nutrient concentration of two C4 turfgrass species (Cynodon dactylon x Cynodon transvaalensis Burtt Davy and Paspalum vaginatum Swartz) supplied with three different nutrient solutions in a sand and peat culture. The 8-week experiment was performed in mesocosms and simulated the conditions of an open-field phyto-treatment system located in a Mediterranean drained peatland (Tuscany, Italy). Peat was collected on the site, and one of the solutions mimicked drainage water flowing into it. Three hypotheses were tested: (i) the species chosen efficiently removed nutrients from both the solution and the substrate; (ii) peat contributed to the nutrient load; and (iii) the species chosen were suitable in the open-field system. Both species adapted well to the experimental conditions and demonstrated considerable ability to remove nutrients. P. vaginatum took up nitrogen more efficiently, mainly in conditions of high nutrient availability. We observed supplementary nutrient uptake by plants in the peat treatment. Performances of the two C4 turfgrasses extrapolated to the field scale seemed effective from a phyto-treatment perspective.

AB Canada's post-mined oil sands will have a higher concentration of salts compared with freshwater peatlands that dominate the landscape. While rare, naturally occurring saline wetlands do exist in Alberta's Boreal Plains and may function as analogues for reclamation, however, little is known about their hydrology. This paper investigates the geochemical and hydrologic characteristics of a natural saline-spring peatland in Alberta's oil sands region. The fen is located within a saline groundwater discharge area connected to the erosional edge of the Grand Rapids Formation. Na+ (195-25,680 mgl(-1)) and Cl- (1785-56,249 mgl(-1)) were the dominant salts, and the fen transitioned sharply to freshwater along its margins because in part of subsurface mineral ridges that restricted shallow groundwater exchange. Salinity decreased from hypersaline to brackish along the local groundwater flow path but no active spring outlets were observed over the two-year study. Vertical groundwater discharge was minimal because of the very low permeability of the underlying sediments. Subsurface storage was exceeded during periods of high flow, resulting in flooding and surface runoff that was enhanced by the ephemerally connected pond network. These findings have implications for reclamation, as mechanisms such as subsurface mineral ridges may function as effective saline groundwater-control structures in the post-mined environment. Incorporating saline wetlands into regional monitoring networks will help to better quantify natural discharge, which has implications for belowground wastewater storage related to in situ bitumen extraction.

AB We studied the vegetation, testate amoebae and abiotic variables (depth of the water table, pH, electrical conductivity, Ca and Mg concentrations of water extracted from mosses) along the bog to extremely rich fen gradient in sub-alpine peatlands of the Upper Engadine (Swiss Alps). Testate amoeba diversity was correlated to that of mosses but not of vascular plants. Diversity peaked in rich fen for testate amoebae and in extremely rich fen for mosses, while for testate amoebae and mosses it was lowest in bog but for vascular plants in extremely rich fen. Multiple factor and redundancy analyses (RDA) revealed a stronger correlation of testate amoebae than of vegetation to water table and hydrochemical variables and relatively strong correlation between testate amoeba and moss community data. In RDA, hydrochemical variables explained a higher proportion of the testate amoeba and moss data than water table depth. Abiotic variables explained a higher percentage of the species data for testate amoebae (30.3% or 19.5% for binary data) than for mosses (13.4%) and vascular plants (10%). These results show that (1) vascular plant, moss and testate amoeba communities respond differently to ecological gradients in peatlands and (2) testate amoebae are more strongly related than vascular plants to the abiotic factors at the mire surface. These differences are related to vertical trophic gradients and associated niche differentiation.

AB A hydrobiogeochemical investigation of a small headwater peatland located in the Experimental Lakes Area, northwestern Ontario, Canada, examined the surface and subsurface hydrologic pathways and their relation to the movement and spatial variability of methylmercury (CH3Hg+). The hydrology of the peatland controls the mass flux of CH3Hg+ to a downstream pond from the terrestrial ecosystems, and influences the production and/or accumulation of CH3Hg+ in the peatland. Distinct zones of groundwater recharge and discharge were observed within the peatland, and these corresponded, to low and high CH3Hg+ concentrations, respectively, in pore water. The magnitude and flux of CH3Hg+ from the peatland was governed by the area of the peatland and surrounding uplands contributing runoff. There was a threefold increase in CH3Hg+ concentration as stream base flow passed from the origin of the stream at the hillslope-peatland margin to the stream outlet at the peatland-lake interface. This relative increase in concentration was maintained during storm flow conditions even though the discharge was up to 10 times greater, indicating that the peatland is a large source of CH3Hg+. Methylmercury-laden peat pore water found near the surface of the peatland in areas of groundwater discharge moves to the stream as the water table rises to the peat surface. Of a total of 12.6 mg CH3Hg+ leaving the peatland during the 112-day study period, less than 1% was transported directly by groundwater, 41% was transported in stream base flow, and the remaining 58% was transported by storm flow. However, storm flow conditions occurred only 16% of the time, indicating the significance of episodic CH3Hg+ flux from headwater catchments on the Precambrian Shield.

AB Saltwater intrusion due to sea level rise is a major concern for the Florida Everglades because it may induce shifts in ecosystem productivity and physical soil properties. However, the effects of saline water intrusion into the current carbon gas dynamics of the Everglades (particularly in terms of biogenic gas production and emissions, i.e., CH4 and CO2) are still uncertain. In this work, we present a laboratory-based study to simulate how sea level rise may alter the physical properties (i.e., hydraulic conductivity) of peat soils from the Everglades and consequently affect the accumulation and release of biogenic gases within the peat matrix. Peat monoliths collected from the Everglades were subjected to progressive increases in salinity from a NaCl solution, and changes to the biogenic gas dynamics regime were simultaneously monitored using a combination of time-lapse ground-penetrating radar measurements, manometers, time-lapse photography, and gas traps. Physical changes to the peat matrix at each salinity interval were assessed using constant head permeameter tests. Consistent with previous research, results show that a progressive increase in salinity (from fresh to saltwater) results in (1) a progressive increase in hydraulic conductivity and (2) a progressive decrease in gas content within the peat matrix (i.e., production) and gas releases. This work has implications for better understanding the potential effects of saltwater intrusion into freshwater peatland systems in the Everglades, particularly in terms of carbon gas dynamics.

AB Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) is an important soil parameter that is difficult to measure, especially in an anisotropic medium. Many methods for determining K-s have been developed over time, but taking different water flow directions into consideration is possible in only a few of them; furthermore, these few methods cannot be universally applied. The method proposed here allows K-s to be determined in both anisotropic and heterogeneous soils. It involves testing cubic soil cores using the Wit apparatus. To use this permeameter for samples that are not cylindrical in shape, it is necessary to prepare special measurement equipment. One such set of equipment developed consists of the soil cube (four sides of which are sealed with gypsum), which is placed in a protective box and connected to a measurement cuboid. In the soil sample, water always flows from the bottom up during the test, but it is possible to turn the sample over and thus analyze different water flow directions. The soil cubes needed are small (0.05 by 0.05 by 0.05 m), but for a particular set of conditions only 15 cores extracted from each sampling location was found to be enough to determine K-s with a precision of +/-15%. Results yielded by the presented method appeared to be comparable with K-s values obtained using a constant-head permeameter with cylindrical soil cores. The advantages of the proposed technique are the possibility of measuring K-s in both horizontal and vertical directions using the same sample, a lack of leakage along the edges of a sample, the ease of soil sample extraction, and the technique's use of inexpensive materials.

AB Peatlands cover similar to 3% of the world's landmass and large expanses have been altered significantly as a consequence of land use change. Forestry activities are a key pressure on these catchments increasing suspended sediment and nutrient export to receiving waters. The aim of this study was to investigate stream dissolved oxygen (DO) and metabolic activity response following clearfelling of a 39-year-old lodgepole pine and Sitka spruce forestry in an upland peat catchment. Significant effects of clearfelling on water temperature, flows, DO and stream metabolic (photosynthesis, respiration) rates were revealed. Stream temperature and discharge significantly increased in the study stream following deadening. Instream ecosystem respiration increased significantly following clearfelling, indicating an increase in the net consumption of organic carbon. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Given the continuing concern about rising concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in stream water leaving peat-covered catchments, this study has considered the impact of managed burning or cutting of Calluna vulgaris, a dominant vegetation cover in many UK peatlands. Pristine mature Calluna stands were compared with those that had been subject to cutting and or managed burning up to 5years after intervention. The study measured the DOC concentration of both soil and surface runoff water over a period of 12months in comparison with water table depth, conductivity, and pH. The results show the following: The depth to the water table decreases upon both burnt and cut sites relative to controls in line with a change in evapotranspiration due to loss of vegetation. The DOC concentration of surface runoff water was not significantly different (P<0.05) between any of the treatments and the control. The DOC concentration in soil water significantly (P<0.05) decreased with both burning and cutting, but these differences could be explained by differences in water table and changes in flowpath through the soil profile. The study suggests that declines in soil water DOC concentration are brought about as different levels in the peat profile become the dominant source of water due to changes in the depth to water table. Changes in the depth to water table were brought about by changes in evapotranspiration that result from the loss of vegetation. The changes in water table mean that this mechanism may explain other observations of DOC concentration change with management. Cutting and burning may represent a management intervention that could be effective at reversing the current trends in DOC transfers from peat-covered catchments.

ID COMPRESSION; SOIL; BEHAVIOR; CEMENT
AB Peat has been considered a problematic geotechnical material, with extremely high water content, low shear strength and high compressibility. Although initially high, fibrous peat undergoes dramatic reductions in permeability under compression, with secondary compression (creep) accounting for a large proportion of the settlement under loading. The key to accelerating the whole consolidation process for fibrous/hemic peats is to create a means of accelerating water flow from micropores (within the cellular structure) or humus contained in the peat. This paper presents the results of preliminary laboratory trials performed using the hydraulic consolidation (Rowe) cell apparatus to investigate a novel approach involving the addition of salt grains to fibrous peat towards accelerating its rate of primary consolidation and reducing its creep rate. Under similar loading conditions, salt-treated specimens were found to have reduced rate and magnitude of creep settlement, explained by larger volumes of micropore water expelled during primary consolidation.

AB 1 On many peatlands, a patterned landscape is formed by clusters of open-water pools enclosed by the peat of surrounding terrestrial and semi-aquatic habitats. Processes governing development of pool complexes operate over long time-scales (decades to millennia) that preclude direct observation and necessitate inferential analysis.
   2 We used present-day scaling relationships and spatial patterns of pools to test multiple hypotheses for development and dynamics of a bog pool complex in the Flow Country of northern Scotland. The complex included 641 permanent pools, ranging in surface area from 2.3 to 1930 m(2).
   3 Allometric scaling relationships and spatial analysis showed that the shape and distribution of pools is size- (or age-) dependent. With increasing size, pools became deeper relative to their surroundings and more convoluted and elongated in shape. Pool orientation and bathymetry were related to direction of slope. Small pools were located on the periphery of a focus now occupied by the largest pools. Peat depth varied systematically across the complex, leading to changes in both direction and gradient of water flow.
   4 The evidence suggests that pools formed initially where water tended to pond, and subsequently spread outward as the flat plateau expanded. Pools have accumulated sediment more slowly than surrounding areas, and the continued initiation of new pools seems to depend on this spatial variation in rates of sediment accumulation. Our study provides both a fuller understanding of the development of one pool complex, and techniques for comparative analysis of others.

AB Peatlands are among the largest long-term soil carbon stores on the globe, but their degradation can lead to significant carbon losses. Therefore, restoration of peatlands has received considerable attention but the impact of revegetation upon critical water quality parameters has not been assessed. In this paper we consider a 5-year study of three restored sites in comparison to both an unrestored, bare peat control and to a vegetated control that did not require restoration. The soil porewater dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC) was measured (6 replicates) for each restoration treatment and each control. The soil water measurements were made in the context of measuring the depth to water table; soil water pH and conductivity; and DOC concentration in surface runoff for the same restored and control treatment. The study showed that the average soil porewater DOC concentration on the restored sites rose significantly over the 5 year study representing a 34% increase relative to the vegetated control and an 11% increase relative to the unrestored, bare control. Soil pore water concentrations were not significantly different from surface runoff DOC concentrations, and therefore restoration as conducted by this study would have contributed to water quality deterioration in the catchment. However, had water table restoration been conducted alongside revegetation then a significant decline in DOC concentrations could have been realised. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The acrotelm-catotelm model of peatland hydrological and biogeochemical processes posits that the permeability of raised bogs is largely homogenous laterally but varies strongly with depth through the soil profile; uppermost peat layers are highly permeable while deeper layers are, effectively, impermeable. We measured down-core changes in peat permeability, plant macrofossil assemblages, dry bulk density and degree of humification beneath two types of characteristic peatland microform - ridges and hollows - at a raised bog in Wales. Six C-14 dates were also collected for one hollow and an adjacent ridge. Contrary to the acrotelm-catotelm model, we found that deeper peat can be as highly permeable as near-surface peat and that its permeability can vary by more than an order of magnitude between microforms over horizontal distances of 1-5m. Our palaeoecological data paint a complicated picture of microform persistence. Some microforms can remain in the same position on a bog for millennia, growing vertically upwards as the bog grows. However, adjacent areas on the bog (<10m distant) show switches between microform type over time, indicating a lack of persistence.Synthesis. We suggest that the acrotelm-catotelm model should be used cautiously; spatial variations in peatland permeability do not fit the simple patterns suggested by the model. To understand how peatlands as a whole function both hydrologically and ecologically, it is necessary to understand how patterns of peat physical properties and peatland vegetation develop and persist.

AB [1] Discrete zones of groundwater discharge in a stream within a peat-dominated wetland were identified on the basis of variations in streambed temperature using a distributed temperature sensor (DTS). The DTS gives measurements of the spatial (+/- 1 m) and temporal (15 min) variation of streambed temperature over a much larger reach of stream (> 800 m) than previous methods. Isolated temperature anomalies observed along the stream correspond to focused groundwater discharge zones likely caused by soil pipes within the peat. The DTS also recorded variations in the number of temperature anomalies, where higher numbers correlated well with a gaining reach identified by stream gauging. Focused zones of groundwater discharge showed essentially no change in position over successive measurement periods. Results suggest DTS measurements will complement other techniques ( e. g., seepage meters and stream gauging) and help further improve our understanding of groundwater-surface water dynamics in wetland streams.

AB Natural peat soils serve as important sinks for nutrients, organic components, and water. Peat soils can pose major environmental problems when they are drained for agricultural production, which may change their role in the landscape from a sink to a source. To successfully restore and conserve peat soils, it is important to understand the soil-moisture dynamics and water demand of drained peat soils for different climate and groundwater conditions. For this purpose, we conducted a series of lysimeter experiments with peat soils subject to different groundwater levels. Evapotranspiration (ET) rates and upward capillary fluxes in peat soils under grass were measured, while TDR probes and tensiometers were used to monitor the soil-water dynamics in the lysimeter during the growing season. The lysimeter data were simulated using an extended version of HYDRUS-1D to enable ET calculations using the Penman-Monteith equation. A physically based approach was tested to predict the canopy resistance as a function of the average pressure head of the soil root zone. The numerical simulations closely followed the observed soil-moisture dynamics in the lysimeter and were consistent with measured differences in ET rates for different groundwater levels. Besides average climate conditions, the effects of extreme dry and wet weather conditions on ET and groundwater recharge during the growing season were evaluated using the calibrated numerical model for different groundwater levels. Evapotranspiration rates during dry years depended very much on upward capillary flow from the water table and hence on the soil hydraulic properties. During wet years, however, ET was controlled mostly by the evaporative demand of the atmosphere, and much less by the soil hydraulic properties.

AB The rough morphology of the relief does not allow true raised peat bogs to develop in the Alps. Alpine peatlands are located on more or less inclined terrain and show series of transitional types from ombrosoligenous mires to fens, thus complicating the task of typifying mires and mire complexes. In this study five peatlands situated in the upper montane - lower subalpine vegetation belt of the South Tyrolian Alps (Italy) were considered as a representative sample of that range. Vegetation was studied by field releves and mapped. Watertable depth as well as hydrochemistry (pH, electrical conductivity, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) were monitored along transects at all sites.
   By means of average linkage clustering (with Jaccard-index as similarity-coefficient) and comparison with material published up to now 9 different vegetation types belonging to 4 alliances (Piceion abietis / Bazzanio-Piceetum; Sphagnion magellanici / Pine mugo-Sphagnetum, Sphagnetum magellanici with 2 subassociations; Rhynchosporion albae / Caricetum rostratae, Caricetum limosae with 2 subassociations; Caricion davallianae / Schoenetum ferruginei, Caricetum davallianae) were distinguished. The peatlands analysed revealed as complexes of hydrologically different segments. In no case, however, could a clear delimintation be defined between ombrotrophic and minerotrophic areas since the peat surface is never distinctly raised above the surrounding terrain.
   Two main groups of peatlands could be distinguished. First, fen complexes heavily influenced by ground water and covered by a brown-moss sedge vegetation. These peatlands also include more or less extensive carpets of Sphagna that can be either distinctly minerotrophic or nearly ombrotrophic. Second, bog complexes mostly covered by a hummock-hollow mosaic having, if any, only a very loose contact with telluric water. A peripheric lagg is poorly differentiated at all of these latter sites. However, a narrow belt of wet fen often develops at the downslope edge. It can either directly rest on the mineral substrate or on humified acidic peat.
   Plant communities defined by the BRAUN-BLANQUET approach are predictive with respect to mire habitat, especially when operating at a low hierarchical rank (subassociations). Even though most of those communities are by no means restricted to a given mire type, the whole vegetational pattern is well correlated with gross hydromorphological features.

AB Physical and chemical, and pore-scale to field-scale properties of peat soil affect the migration of non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) and dissolved-phase solutes in contaminated peatlands in a way not anticipated based on the current understanding derived from their behavior in mineral soil systems. Peat pore surface wettability, which is determined by pore surface chemistry, has strong hysteresis and shows hydrophilic and hydrophobic behaviors during water drainage from and water imbibition into pore spaces. This leads to high residual NAPL saturation in pore spaces. Systematic reduction of pore radius size with depth associated with greater peat decomposition in a typical peat profile leads to an increase in NAPL-entry capillary pressure and a reduction in peat permeability with increasing depth. The former leads to stronger capillarity in deeper peat horizons, causing resistance to NAPL percolation compared to that in shallow ones; along with decreased permeability with depth, this results in higher NAPL mobility in shallower peat. The cumulative effect is preferential horizontal migration of NAPL in shallow less decomposed peat horizons. Occupation of peat macro-pores by NAPL dramatically decreases the effective water permeability and leads to lower rates of water infiltration and groundwater discharge in the contaminated area. With respect to dissolved-phase hydrocarbons, the dual porosity structure of peat soil, which exhibits larger pores and higher effective porosity near the surface, also favours preferential transport in the surface peat layer, and leads to increasing solute retardation with depth. In addition, adsorption of hydrocarbon solutes onto natural dissolved organic carbon present in peat pore water influences the effective adsorption of hydrocarbon solutes onto peat by reducing the apparent adsorption partitioning coefficient. The concepts and evidence presented in this manuscript suggest both free-phase and dissolved-phase hydrocarbon have restricted mobility in peatlands. On this basis, in large peatlands where ecological function is not notably impacted, a case can be made for allowing natural processes to degrade the hydrocarbon, rather than the common response of digging up and disposing of contaminated soils, which destroys the ecosystem function.

AB Vertical water transport plays an important role in the development and maintenance of lakes in arid zones. However, previous study of this phenomenon has focused mainly on the effects of regional precipitation, rather than effects of groundwater recharge, on arid-zone environmental change. We selected a sedimentary profile from a seasonal lake basin located in the hinterland of the Badain Jaran Desert, northwestern China, to assess the Holocene environmental evolution of this region and its response to climate change. Our results show that peat deposition from 11 to 10 ka indicates humidification after Younger Dryas (YD) event; the lake sediment and lower EM2 and lower principal component analysis (PCA)-1 scores indicate relative more humid environment from 10 to 7.8 ka; the lake sediment and higher EM2 and higher PCA-1 scores indicate most humid environment from 7.8 to 5.8 ka; the transition from lacustrine facies to limnetic facies and increasing salinity indicate drying trend from 5.8 to 2.5 ka; the aeolian sand sediment and lowest EM2 and lowest PCA-1 scores indicate driest environment from 2.5 to 0.8 ka; and lacustrine facies and finest grain size indicate relative humid environment during the 'Little Ice Age' period. The environment was relative humid in early Holocene, most Humid in mid-Holocene, and dry in mid-late Holocene. The moisture pattern in the hinterland of the Badain Jaran Desert was synchronous with that in the northeastern of Tibetan Plateau, which implies that the groundwater recharge lake was dominated by the intensity of groundwater recharge from monsoon margin area, especially the northeastern of Tibetan Plateau. As a record from groundwater recharge lake without runoff, our study provides the groundwater output quantity record from northeastern of Tibetan Plateau and would benefit the environment change research and regional water resources allocation around the Tibetan Plateau.

AB Here results are presented of a hydrochemical study at a pristine and two acid rain-impacted catchments in Norway. An analysis of streamwater chemical data interpreted as mixtures of observed soil solutions, is combined with data on the spatial distribution of soils. The analysis reveals that at all three sites low flow streamwater is dominated by groundwater, relatively rich in base cations, originating from the peat bogs adjacent to the brook. By contrast, high flow largely originates in catchment-specific acidic soil horizons on the hill slopes. Results indicate that short-term and long term hydrochemical responses to acid deposition may differ between catchments which at first glance have a 'similar' make up of acidic soils. This illustrates the difficulty in selecting appropriate sites for comparative studies of the effect of acid atmospheric deposition on the chemistry of streamwater.

AB Landslide mountain fens formed in landslide depressions are dynamic environments as their development is disturbed by a number of factors, for example, landslides, slopewash, and surface run-off. These processes lead to the accumulation of mineral material and wood in peat. Disturbed peatlands are interesting archives of past environmental changes, but they may be challenging for providing biotic proxy-based quantitative reconstructions. Here we investigate long-term changes in testate amoeba communities from two landslide mountain fens - so far an overlooked habitat for testate amoeba investigations. Our results show that abundances of testate amoebae are extremely low in this type of peatlands, therefore not suitable for providing quantitative depth-to-water table reconstructions. However, frequent shifts of dominant testate amoeba species reflect dynamic lithological situation of the studied fens. We observed that high and stable mineral matter input into the peatlands was associated with high abundances of species producing agglutinated (xenosomic) as well as idiosomic shells which prevailed in the testate amoeba communities in both analyzed profiles. This is the first study that explores testate amoebae of landslide mountain fens in such detail, providing novel information about microbial communities of these ecosystems.

AB Understanding the source of water supplying high-altitude wetlands in Colorado has gained importance as water supply demands increase in the region. The fens of South Park are rare in their very high water nutrient concentrations and they support a valuable ecosystem dependent on groundwater discharge. Chemical and stable isotopic techniques are applied to determine the proportion of surface water and groundwater discharging at Tarryall Mire and Link Ditch Fen. The major ion chemistry of the fens can be evolved from either surface water or groundwater using a reasonable sequence of reactions driven by decomposition of organic matter, reduction of pH and dissolution of carbonate minerals, resulting in large increases in calcium and bicarbonate concentrations in the fens. The water chemistry alone is a poor indicator of fen-water origin because biologically mediated reactions alter the water chemistry. By contrast, the absence of geothermal exchange reactions and evaporative effects allow the stable isotopic composition of the water to be an excellent tracer in this environment. The stable isotopic data indicate that local groundwater contributes significantly to the fens, providing over three-quarters of the water. A high degree of variability in the contribution of groundwater to the fens is observed both spatially and temporally. By late summer, streams in the wetland appear to be gaining and exhibit characteristics of discharged groundwater.

AB In restoration planning for damaged raised bogs, the lagg at the bog margin is often not given considerable weight and is sometimes disregarded entirely. However, the lagg is critical for the proper functioning of the bog, as it supports the water mound in the bog. In order to include the lagg in a restoration plan for a raised bog, it is necessary to understand the hydrological characteristics and functions of this rarely studied transition zone. We studied 13 coastal British Columbia (BC) bogs and identified two different gradients in depth to water table, hydrochemistry and peat properties: (1) a local bog expanse-bog margin gradient, and (2) a regional gradient related to climate and proximity to the ocean. Depth to water table generally increased across the transition from bog expanse to bog margin. In the bog expanse, pH was above 4.2 in the Pacific Oceanic wetland region (cooler and wetter climate) and below 4.3 in the Pacific Temperate wetland region (warmer and drier climate). Both pH and pH-corrected electrical conductivity increased significantly across the transition from bog expanse to bog margin, though not in all cases. Na+ and Mg2+ concentrations were generally highest in exposed, oceanic bogs and lower in inland bogs. Ash content in peat samples increased across the bog expanse-bog margin transition, and appears to be a useful abiotic indicator of the location of the bog margin. The observed variation in the hydrological and hydrochemical gradients across the bog expanse-bog margin transition highlights both local and regional diversity of bogs and their associated laggs.

AB Role of changing climatic conditions on permafrost degradation and hydrology was investigated in the transition zone between the tundra and forest ecotones at the boundary of continuous and discontinuous permafrost of the lower Yenisei River. Three watersheds of various sizes were chosen to represent the characteristics of the regional landscape conditions. Samples of river flow, precipitation, snow cover, and permafrost ground ice were collected over the watersheds to determine isotopic composition of potential sources of water in a river flow over a two year period. Increases in air temperature over the last forty years have resulted in permafrost degradation and a decrease in the seasonal frost which is evident from soil temperature measurements, permafrost and active-layer monitoring, and analysis of satellite imagery. The lowering of the permafrost table has led to an increased storage capacity of permafrost affected soils and a higher contribution of ground water to river discharge during winter months. A progressive decrease in the thickness of the layer of seasonal freezing allows more water storage and pathways for water during the winter low period making winter discharge dependent on the timing and amount of late summer precipitation. There is a substantial seasonal variability of stable isotopic composition of river flow. Spring flooding corresponds to the isotopic composition of snow cover prior to the snowmelt. Isotopic composition of river flow during the summer period follows the variability of precipitation in smaller creeks, while the water flow of larger watersheds is influenced by the secondary evaporation of water temporarily stored in thermokarst lakes and bogs. Late summer precipitation determines the isotopic composition of texture ice within the active layer in tundra landscapes and the seasonal freezing layer in forested landscapes as well as the composition of the water flow during winter months.

ID PEAT PLATEAU; DISTURBANCE
AB Intensive seismic exploration in the Northwest Territories began in the late 1960s. Since that time, the legacy of seismic surveys - i.e. straight lines cutting through boreal forest and tundra - has remained visible throughout northern Canada and Alaska. The removal of trees and compaction of the ground surface alter the thermophysical properties of the active (i.e. seasonally thawed) layer to such an extent that the underlying permafrost seriously degrades or even disappears completely. Such a transformation along linear corridors that cut indiscriminately across different terrain types with contrasting hydrological functions has potentially serious implications to the redistribution of water and energy within and among landscape units with feedbacks to permafrost thaw, land cover change and run-off generation. This paper characterizes the flow and storage of water and energy along a seismic cut line in the high boreal zone of discontinuous permafrost in order to improve the understanding of these processes, their interactions and hydrological implications. As such, this paper lays a conceptual foundation for the development of numerical models needed to predict the hydrological and thermal impact of seismic lines in this sensitive region. We used ground-penetrating radar and multi-year ground temperatures and water levels along a seismic line to estimate the degree of permafrost degradation below it. The seismic line studied extends from a permafrost-free wetland (flat bog), over a permafrost body (peat plateau) and into another permafrost-free wetland (channel fen). It was found that once thaw had lowered the permafrost table below the ground surface elevation of the flat bog and channel fen, the seismic line forms a hydrological connection between them. It was also shown that during the permafrost thaw process, seismic lines develop a perennially thawed layer (talik) between the overlying active layer and underlying permafrost and that the talik conveys water as a conduit throughout the year. The implications of such drainage through seismic lines and networks on basin drainage in peatland-dominated regions with discontinuous permafrost are also discussed.

AB Peatlands occupy about 4% of Poland's area and perform important environmental and economic functions, including agricultural ones. In the last century, the majority of fen peatlands were drained for agricultural use. Drainage reduced the water retention of peat and initiated changes in their physical and water properties. In order to determine the rate and extent of changes in these properties, in the following years 1987, 2007 and 2018, studies were carried out within the Suprasl Dolna fen peatland, NE Poland, in two prognostic soil-moisture complexes: moist (PSMC-B) and dry (PSMC-C). Studies have shown that in the PSMC-B complex, the water table depth decreased to a maximum of 100 cm below ground level, while on the PSMC-C complex, the ground water decreased even to 150 cm below ground level. In the PSMC-B complex, peat mineralisation and physical-water properties changed to a small extent during the research period (statistically insignificant). In the PSMC-C habitat, the subsidence of peatland surface was observed (11 cm), bulk density increased, whereas the total porosity and full water capacity decreased. Deterioration in physical and water properties caused gradual degradation of drained fen peatland soils and their evolution towards organo-mineral soils. In order to slow down or even stop degradation processes in shallow and medium deep peat-mursh soils, there is a need to stop and regulate the outflow of water using efficient drainage facilities, as well as to carry out technical restoration works.

AB The globally widespread drainage of peatlands has often been shown to lead to increased concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in streams and rivers. Elevated DOC concentrations have implications for carbon cycling, ecosystem functioning, and potable water treatment. Peatland rewetting, principally through ditch blocking, is often carried out with the expectation that this will reduce DOC concentrations. Uncertainty still remains as to whether drainage, or its reversal via ditch blocking, will also lead to changes in the molecular composition of DOC/dissolved organic matter (DOM), which have the potential to affect downstream processing and treatability of U.K. drinking water supplies. To investigate this question, we used a replicated experiment consisting of 12 parallel ditches on an upland bog and took samples of ditch water, pore water, and overland flow water for 4 years. After a brief preblocking baseline period, eight ditches were blocked using two methods. A complementary suite of optical metrics, chemical measurements, and analytical techniques revealed that ditch blocking had no consistent effect on DOM quality, up to 4 years after blocking. Where significant differences were found, effect size calculations demonstrated that these differences were small and would therefore have minimal impact upon water treatability. Furthermore, some differences between ditches were evident before blocking took place, highlighting the need for robust baseline monitoring before intervention. Based on our results from a hillslope-scale experiment, we were unable to identify clear evidence that peatland ditch blocking will deliver benefits in terms of DOM treatability in potable water supplies, although we also did not find any evidence of short-term deterioration in water quality during the restoration period. We conclude that, although peatland restoration can be expected to deliver other benefits such as reduced carbon loss and enhanced biodiversity, it is doubtful whether it will lead to improvements in drinking water treatability.

AB Questions: Were continued groundwater discharge and mowing regimes sufficient for vegetation preservation from 1944 to 1993? Which has a stronger effect on vegetation development; groundwater discharge or mowing? What is the role of surface water eutrophication as driver of vegetation change?
   Location: Het Hol, The Netherlands (ca. 92 ha, 52 degrees 13' N, 5 degrees 05' E).
   Methods: Hydrology was simulated for the late 1940s, early 1960s and 1987. Vegetation maps (1944, 1960, 1975 and 1993) were compared for biotope cover. Vegetation recordings in 1944 and 1987 were compared. Surface water quality was compared between 1950 and 1987. Which sites were mown was reconstructed from an interview. Effects of periodic mowing and groundwater discharge on vegetation development were tested for correlation.
   Results: Biotope diversity reduced significantly through decrease of semi-aquatic and tall-herb biotopes, and expansion of forest. The quagfen terrestrialization sere nearly disappeared from 1987 recordings, while the reed sere did well concerning abundance and species richness. Several typical (rich) fen species disappeared from recordings, while new species were mostly field margin species. Periodic mowing and discharge combined are correlated with increasing species numbers. The P-concentration in surface water increased while N-concentration decreased.
   Conclusions: Preservation of the reed sere was successful, whereas preservation of the quagfen sere was not. Periodic mowing and discharge stimulate species richness, discharge more so than periodic mowing. But slight eutrophication likely induced a shift from P-limitation to N-limitation, which stimulated the reed sere at the expense of the quagfen sere.

AB The extent of drainage impact was studied in five transitional mires along a hydrosequence. The principal environmental variables driven by drainage are the minimum water level in the peat layer, together with the dry matter and total-N contents of peat. The drawdown effect of a cutoff ditch (intercepting surface and subsurface flow) on the minimum water level extends to a distance of 250-320 m. Peat water levels above -50 cm are associated with a sharp increase in Sphagnum cover, and the percentage of bog-specific species increases markedly when the minimum water level is higher than -25 cm. The girths and heights of trees and canopy closure of the tree layer decrease rapidly up to a distance of 200 m from the cutoff ditch. Negative impacts of the cutoff ditch on the canopy cover and average height of trees, estimated using LIDAR data, can be followed for distances up to 400 m and 350 m, respectively. The density and height of shrub stems start to increase at a distance of 16 m and continue to increase up to 400 m from the cutoff ditch. The percentage of bog-specific species increases up to a distance of 100 m, whilst the percentage of fen-specific species begins to decrease remarkably at a distance of about 200 m from the cutoff ditch.

AB We studied a Great Lakes peatland protected by a barrier dune system to test the hypothesis that changes in the morphology of a barrier beach alter the wetland surface-water and ground-water hydrology such that the plant rooting zone in the wetland interior might be affected. Hydraulic head measured in observation wells located on transects perpendicular to a flow-through channel, uplands, and Lake Ontario were compared to lake-level changes, weather patterns, and the temporal conditions of the barrier beach. Water-table elevations within the wetland complex always remained 0.35 to 0.84 m above Lake Ontario's water level (mean difference = 0.62 m) and did not fluctuate in parallel with changes in the lake's water level. Flooding events occurred when breaches closed and isolated the wetland complex from Lake Ontario; daily average water levels rose between 0.06 m and 0.27 m. When the barrier beach was breached naturally or by human activity, daily average water-table elevations in the wetland receded between 0.16 m and 0.41 m. During the growing season, vertical ground-water-flow directions also changed as a function of changing hydraulics controlled by the barrier beach. Vertical recharge-discharge gradients ranged from -0.2 to 0.1 m.m(-1). Water-table elevation and hydraulic head gradients across the study area were controlled primarily by short-term (days to weeks) changes in shoreline geomorphology, whereas seasonal weather patterns and Lake Ontario water-level fluctuations imposed secondary controls on the ground-water-flow regime.

AB Wetlands in general and mires in particular belong to the most important terrestrial carbon stocks globally. Mires (i.e. bogs, transition bogs and fens) are assumed to be especially vulnerable to climate change because they depend on specific, namely cool and humid, climatic conditions. In this paper, we use distribution data of the nine mire types to be found in Austria and habitat distribution models for four IPCC scenarios to evaluate climate change induced risks for mire ecosystems within the 21st century. We found that climatic factors substantially contribute to explain the current distribution of all nine Austrian mire ecosystem types. Summer temperature proved to be the most important predictor for the majority of mire ecosystems. Precipitation-mostly spring and summer precipitation sums-was influential for some mire ecosystem types which depend partly or entirely on ground water supply (e.g. fens). We found severe climate change induced risks for all mire ecosystems, with rain-fed bog ecosystems being most threatened. Differences between scenarios are moderate for the mid-21st century, but become more pronounced towards the end of the 21st century, with near total loss of climate space projected for some ecosystem types (bogs, quagmires) under severe climate change. Our results imply that even under minimum expected, i.e. inevitable climate change, climatic risks for mires in Austria will be considerable. Nevertheless, the pronounced differences in projected habitat loss between moderate and severe climate change scenarios indicate that limiting future warming will likely contribute to enhance long-term survival of mire ecosystems, and to reduce future greenhouse gas emissions from decomposing peat. Effectively stopping and reversing the deterioration of mire ecosystems caused by conventional threats can be regarded as a contribution to climate change mitigation. Because hydrologically intact mires are more resilient to climatic changes, this would also maintain the nature conservation value of mires, and help to reduce the severe climatic risks to which most Austrian mire ecosystems may be exposed in the 2nd half of the 21st century according to IPCC scenarios.

AB Water table depth (WTD) is one of the key variables controlling many processes in peatlands. Reliable WTD estimates based on remote sensing data would advance peatland research from global-scale climate monitoring to field-scale ecosystem management. Here, we evaluate the relationship between ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) C-band backscatter (sigma degrees) and in situ observed WTD dynamics over 17 peatlands in Germany covering deeply-drained to natural conditions, excluding peatlands dominated by forest or inundation periods. The results show increasing sigma degrees with shallower WTD (= wetter conditions), with average temporal Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.38 and 0.54 (-) for natural (also including disturbed and rewetted/restored states) and agriculturally-used drained peatlands, respectively. The anomaly correlation further highlights the potential of ASAR backscatter to capture interannual variations with values of 0.33 and 0.43 (-), for natural and drained peatlands. The skill metrics, which are similar to those for evaluations of top soil moisture from C-band over mineral soils, indicate a strong capillary connection between WTD and the ' C-band-sensitive' top 1-2 cm of peat soils, even during dry periods with WTD at around -1 m. Various backscatter processing algorithms were tested without significant differences. The cross-over angle concept for correcting dynamical vegetation effects was tested, but not superior, to constant incidence angle correction.

AB It is common to conceptualize the water table as a subdued replica of surface topography, where groundwater recharges at, and flows from, topographic highs and flows to, and discharges at, topographic lows, in humid (i.e. wetter) environments. This concept is also regularly applied to peatland hydrology, where hydraulic gradients are shown to be towards the peatland. However, this may not be a realistic representation of hydrology for low-relief and sub-humid regions. While it is widely accepted that peatlands maintain internal water tables in drought conditions through a system of autogenic negative feedback loops, there is a general lack of knowledge concerning the controls on, and patterns of, forestland hydrologic process that drive the hydraulic gradients between wetlands and their adjacent forestlands in water-limited conditions in low-relief areas. This study identifies thehydrologic function(i.e. source or sink of water) of forested uplands and peatlands in the Boreal Plains region of Canada and demonstrates that during a mesic (non-drought) year most peatlands are, in fact, potential sources of groundwater to adjacent forestlands. Sixteen forestland-peatland pairs were selected to represent a spectrum of forested hummock and peatland morphometries, topographic positions, and geologic settings. Hydraulic gradients determined for each well pair during the ice-off season demonstrate that the dominant gradient under mesic climatic conditions is from peatlands to adjacent forestlands, opposite of the topographic gradient, and that the sink-source function of each land unit does not change seasonally. Water table depressions under each forested hummock indicate that boreal forestlands are not reliable sources of groundwater recharge, spatially or temporally, which supports previous research showing that peatlands are the primary water source for runoff; illustrating the need for alternative conceptualizations of catchment hydrology in water limited regions of the boreal. Social Media Summary. Forests are poor sources of water to boreal peatlands and landscapes due to water table depressions.

AB The bog turtle (Glyptemys muhlenbergii) is known to select wetland areas that are near water with deep mud, but water table dynamics in their habitats have not been well described. We installed and monitored shallow groundwater wells to evaluate hydrology over a continuous 28-month period on six wetlands known to be frequently used by bog turtles and six similar wetlands not known to be used. Overall, water tables remained high, with mean monthly depth to the water table for all 12 wetlands varying between -1 cm and -35 cm below the soil surface. Wetlands frequently used by bog turtles had higher mean water tables and surface saturation than wetlands not known to be used, particularly during summer months. Differences in mean water table (17 cm) and saturation (25 %) were greatest during southwestern Virginia's 2008 drought. A differential remained after the resumption of normal rainfall, demonstrating the importance of groundwater recharge to bog turtle wetlands. Relatively small differences in water table hydrology have the potential to affect bog turtle biology and wetland use because bog turtles primarily use the top 15 cm of the soil and select saturated locations even when the availability of saturated soil is limited.

AB Complex interactions occur in riparian wetlands between groundwater, surface water and climatic conditions. Knowledge of the hydrology of these systems is necessary to understand their functioning and their value and models are a useful and probably essential tool to capture their hydrological complexity. In this study, a 2D-model describing saturated-unsaturated water flow is applied to a transect through a groundwater-fed riparian wetland located along the middle reach of the river Dijle. The transect has high levees close to the river and a depression further into the floodplain. Scaling factors are introduced to describe the variability of soil hydraulic properties along the transect. Preliminary model calculations for one year show a good agreement between model calculations and measurements and demonstrate the capability of the model to capture the internal groundwater dynamics. Seasonal variations in soil moisture are reproduced well by the model thus translating external hydrological boundary conditions to root zone conditions. The model proves to be a promising tool for assessing effects of changes in hydrological boundary conditions on vegetation type distribution and to gain more insight in the highly variable internal flow processes of riparian wetlands.

AB Detailed modelling of the hydrological setting of fen meadows appears to be possible provided that detailed information on geomorphology, hydrochemistry and piezometric heads is available fcr a number of years. In the Laegieskamp, a small wetland reserve located in the central part of The Netherlands, a piezometric monitoring network was sampled for water quality analysis and piezometric heads between 1986 and 1992. Average yearly discharge and recharge periods were used for FLOWNET calculations. First, the models were used to determine, with the help of information on water quality, the hydrological systems in the study area. Secondly, they were used to define the present and past hydrological setting of a fen meadow in the reserve. The hydrological systems and water quality in the study area have changed considerably over the past 65 years. At present the fen meadow is mainly fed by precipitation. The mineral-rich conditions favouring the fen meadow vegetation are thought to be maintained thanks to a clayey peat layer and an oscillating shallow water body that prevents rapid leaching of minerals. The sulphate content in the fen exhibits a pattern of temporal variation, which is related to the severity of the annual drought. Our study showed that groundwater flow is mainly lateral, instead of the assumed vertical infiltration of groundwater in previous regional studies. This led us to the conclusion that conservation and restoration perspectives are much better than previously expected. The polluted middle, deep groundwater is not a major threat to this fen at the moment. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Peatland ecosystems may contribute about 65% of all natural methane emission to the atmosphere.  During May-June 1988, CH4 and CO2 fluxes were measured with the static chamber method at the surface of a basin swamp and at three depths.  The daily average fluxes of CH4 and CO2 at the surface of the swamp ranged from 1.146 to 2.178 mmol m-2 d-1 and from 1.966 to 7.242 mmol m-2 d-1, respectively.  These amounts of CH4 and CO2 corresponded to 0.02-0.03% of what was released from the 45 to 60-cm depth when exposed to atmospheric pressure.  Statistically significant correlations between physical and botanical peat properties and trapped CH4 and CO2 and water flow suggest that outgassing of trapped CH4 and CO2 are closely associated with the peat matrix, peat properties, hydraulic potential, temperature, and concentration gradients.

AB In peat soils, decomposition and degradation reduce the proportion of large pores by breaking down plant debris into smaller fragments and infilling inter-particle pore spaces. This affects water flow and solute migration which, in turn, influence reactive transport processes and biogeochemical functions. In this study we conducted flow-through reactor experiments to investigate the interplay between pore structure and solute transport in samples of undegraded and degraded peat collected in Canada and Germany, respectively. The pore size distributions and transport parameters were characterised using the breakthrough curve and two-region non-equilibrium transport model analyses for a non-reactive solute. The results of transport characterisation showed a higher fraction of immobile pores in the degraded peat with higher diffusive exchanges of solutes between the mobile and immobile pores associated with the dual-porosity structure. The rates of steady-state potential nitrate reduction were compared with pore fractions and exchange coefficients to investigate the influence of pore structure on the rates of nitrate reduction. The results indicated that the degraded peat has potential to provide the necessary boundary conditions to support nitrate removal and serves as a favourable substrate for denitrification, due to the nature of its pore structure and its lower organic carbon content compared to undegraded peat.

AB Smouldering wildfire is an important disturbance to peatlands worldwide; it contributes significantly to global carbon emissions and provides positive feedback to climate change. Herein, we explore the feasibility of firebreaks to control smouldering peat fires through laboratory-scale experiments. The dry-mass moisture content (MC) of peat soil was varied from 10% (air-dried) to 125%. We found that smouldering peat fire may be successfully extinguished above the mineral soil layer, even if the peat layer is not entirely removed. There are two criteria for an effective peat firebreak: (I) adding water to make the peat layer sufficiently wet (>115% MC in the present work); and (II) ensuring that the peat layer is thinner than the quenching thickness (< 5 cm). Criterion I may fail if the water table declines or the peat layer is dried by surface fires and hot weather; thus, satisfying Criterion II is more attainable. A sloping trench-shaped firebreak is recommended to guide water flow and help maintain high peat moisture content. This work provides a scientific foundation for fighting and mitigating smouldering wildfires and provides guidance about protective measures for field-scale peat fire experiments.

AB Proxies such as plant macrofossils, humification indices and testate amoebae have been developed to reconstruct past hydrological variability in ombrotrophic peatlands.
   Reconstructions based on these approaches have resulted in records of decadal- to centennial-scale moisture variability in regions of North America and elsewhere. Although the various peatland moisture proxies generally show significant temporal covariance, multi-proxy approaches can refine knowledge of the multivariate nature of climate change and increase confidence in interpretations. Here, we demonstrate that ratios of the abundances of n-alkanes provide a new and efficient way of reconstructing past peatland surface moisture change. We found strong correlations among n-alkane indices, humification indices and testate amoebae-inferred water table depths from a single core. Biogeochemical proxies can be used in paleohydrological reconstructions for ombrotrophic bogs to provide a new and complementary source of data from these under-utilized paleoclimate archives.

AB In this study we present the plant communities, their abiotic site conditions and the main environmental gradients underlying variation in species composition of mire sites in three montane mires in the Northern Limestone Alps. For the phytosociological description of the mires we sampled species composition in 115 releves. In order to characterize the site conditions of the most important plant communities we measured humification as well as water table depth, pH and electrical conductivity at 46 sites during a large part of the growing season. The main environmental gradients were identified by fitting environmental vectors and smoothed surfaces onto NMDS ordination. The most frequent communities on subneutral and neutral sites were the Caricetum davallianae, the Amblystegio stellati-Caricetum dioicae and the Schoenetum ferruginei, whereas acidic sites were mainly covered by the Eriophoro-Trichophoretum cespitosi. The most important factor for floristic variation between sites was pH. However, within bogs and fens, variation in species composition was mainly due to differences in water table depth.

AB Northern peatlands store similar to 500 Pg of carbon (C); however, controls on the spatial distribution of the stored C may differ regionally, owing to the complex interaction among climate, ecosystem processes, and geophysical controls. As a globally significant C sink, elucidation of controls on the distribution of C in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada (HBL), is of particular importance. Although peat age is related to timing of land emergence and peat depth in the HBL, considerable variation in the total C mass (kg m(-2)) among sites of similar peat age suggests that other factors may explain spatial patterns in C storage (Pg) and sequestration. Here we quantify the role of two key factors in explaining the spatial distribution of the C mass in the HBL (n = 364 sites), (i) climate variability and (ii) peat lithology, for two major peatland classes in the HBL (bogs and fens). We find that temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration each explained nearly half of the C mass variability. Regions characterized by warmer and wetter conditions stored the most C as peat. Our results show that bogs and fens store similar amounts of C within a given climate domain, although via distinct storage mechanisms. Namely, fen peats tend to be shallower and more C dense (kg m(-3)) compared to bogs. Following geophysical controls on the timing of peat initiation, our results reveal that both the widespread bog-fen patterning and variability in regional climate contribute to explaining the spatial distribution of the peat C mass in the HBL.

AB Relevance is determined by the important complex role of fens in formation of ecological condition of regions of Western Siberia, including questions of interaction between ground, river and fen waters.
   The aim of the research is analysis of hydro-geological and hydrological conditions of functioning of the Obskoe and Baksinskoe fens in southeast of West Siberian plain. The primary tasks are: 1) estimation of elements of water balance of fens and their basins; 2) estimation and analysis of interaction of fen, river and ground waters.
   Methods: statistical methods, mathematical modelling of hydro-geological and hydrological processes.
   Results and conclusions. The authors have carried out the quantitative estimation of elements of water balance of the Baksinskoe and Obskoe fens and their basins for 1966-2019. Intraannual distribution of infiltration in a paleogene-quaternary deposits of the Ob and Schegarka rivers watershed is determined. Reduction of evaporation from a basin surface and increase of a water flow layer occur at bogging with primary distribution of fens. It results in additional bogging territory. Interaction of surfaces and ground waters with a different degree of intensity is basically limited to depths of 110-120 m. Influence of fen waters on ground waters is probable in summer-autumnal low water. During this period the overflow of fen waters in ground horizons on sites of 800-900 m is possible and the infiltration increases. The influence of fen waters reaches its maximum during the decline of spring flood when water masses are discharged from the swampy flood-plain into the river channel.

SO GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
LA English
DT Article
DE Climate change; Bio-waste; Coconut fiber; Canal block; Peat ecosystem
AB Peat ecosystems play a very important role in controlling global climate stability. Massive channel development in the peatland ecosystem can have an impact on excessive drying of peatland, which is caused by increased water flow rate and decreased water-saving power in the peat region and implicates the increased oxidation, and the vulnerability of fire hazards which contribute to the disaster of climate change. Recovery of degraded and drained peat can be done by building peat rewetting infrastructure, one of which is canal blocking. This study aims to utilize bio-waste material namely coconut fiber waste (CFW) for composite panels for canal block modules. This research was carried out using the hand lay-up method, with composite compositions in the form of polyester, fiberglass, wire mesh, and coconut fiber. The results showed that the composition of the type C composite panel samples had a density value of 0.0853 gr/cm(3), the moisture content value was only 0.16%, thickness swelling was only 0.11%, and the length swelling was only 0.01%, better than other samples. Besides, the type C composite panel sample is also better, with a modulus of rupture (MoR) of 21.845 kgf/ mm(2), modulus of elasticity (MoE) value of 78.057 kgf/mm(2), and impact energy 79.66 Joules. It is expected that coconut fiber waste can be processed and used optimally as a bio-waste for canal block in preventing fire hazards (disaster climate change).

AB Hydrological processes maintain wetlands, whose position in the landscape determines their character and possible response to climate change. We studied such responses to long periods of climate change in a large groundwater fed fen (Mfabeni Mire), which is one of the oldest fen systems in South Africa. The geological and geomorphological setting of the mire was studied as well as its stratigraphy and chronology. The basal peat of the mire was at a depth of 9.9 m dated at ca. 44,000 cal years Before Present (BP). The average accumulation rate during the Late Pleistocene was 0.15 mm/year. During the Holocene it was higher (0.3 mm/year). Despite climate change over this period, peat formation has hardly been interrupted, suggesting that the system has been able to almost continuously sustain peat formation processes. This is possible because the peatland is situated in a valley that is bordered by a highly permeable sand dune cordon with an elevated groundwater table that directs groundwater towards the mire. The mulling of the valley by peat has resulted in a basin with lower permeability than in the surrounding dunes, forcing the water table in the adjacent aquifer to rise, thus ensuring the mire system a supply of groundwater that is large enough to dampen the effects of climatic variation.

AB To assess the response of northern peatlands to hydrological changes, we analysed the response of a model designed to simulate peatland development at a millennial timescale, the Holocene Peat Model, to two hydrological drivers. The study is performed on two open ombrotrophic peatlands located in the James Bay region in North-eastern Canada. For both sites, two simulations were realized: one based on a precipitation reconstruction from pollen data, used as input in the model, and a second using a water-table depth reconstruction derived from testate amoebae to apply a forcing on the model. Simulated variations in carbon accumulation rates (CARs) and vegetation composition were analysed against palaeoecological datasets. In both sites and for the two hydrological drivers, modelling results in CARs showed periods of net carbon loss that coincided with fluctuations in observed CARs, although net carbon loss cannot be traced in palaeoecological datasets per se. The comparison between plant macrofossil records and simulated vegetation distributions highlighted differences between precipitation and water-table depth-driven simulations. Thus, the methodology used was found useful to analyse the origin of vegetation shifts in macrofossil datasets. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Question: We studied vegetation succession after drainage in a bog, as an analogue for potential persistent water table drawdown due to climate change. We asked: (1) how does bog vegetation change following a long-term water table lowering and (2) how are effects of drainage on hydrology and vegetation distributed temporally and spatially?
   Location: Mer Bleue peatland, Ontario, Canada (45.41 degrees N, 75.48 degrees W).
   Methods: Analyses of changes in vegetation and hydrology associated with drainage were examined spatially along a hydrosequence and temporally using paleoecological reconstructions from peat cores (testate amoebae, pollen) in a drained portion of a peatland untouched for 85 years following drainage. Relationships between modern vegetation and water table were assessed through clustering and ordination analyses of vegetation releves.
   Results: Post-drainage increases in tree cover, especially Betula and Larix, decreases in Sphagnum cover and shifts in species composition of dominant shrubs were observed. Present-day vegetation patterns along the hydrosequence were primarily related to seasonal variability of water table depth. Paleoecological records reveal that where the present-day vegetation has been impacted by drainage, persistent water table lowering occurred in response to drainage. However, in an area with relatively natural vegetation, a transient drop in water table depth occurred at the time of drainage.
   Conclusions: Temporal and spatial patterns revealed that the bog response to drainage was spatially and temporally heterogeneous, and probably mediated by feedbacks among vegetation, peat structure and hydrology. Spatial patterns along the hydrosequence were similar to those observed in paleoecological reconstructions, but the use of the two complementary techniques provides additional insights.

AB A before-after-control approach was used to analyze the impact of peatland restoration on hydrology, based on high temporal resolution water-table (WT) data from 43 boreal peatlands representative of a south-boreal to north-boreal climate gradient. During the study, 24 forestry drained sites were restored and 19 pristine peatlands used as control sites. Different approaches were developed and used to analyze WT changes (mean WT position, WT fluctuation, WT hydrograph, recession, and storage characteristics). Restoration increased WT in most cases but particularly in spruce mires, followed by pine mires and fens. Before restoration, the WT fluctuation (WTF) was large, indicating peat temporary storage gain (SG). After restoration, the WT hydrograph recession limb slopes and SG coefficients (Rc) declined significantly. Drainage or restoration did not significantly affect mean diurnal WT fluctuations, used here as a proxy for evapotranspiration. Overall, the changes in WT characteristics following restoration indicated creation of favorable hydrological conditions for recovery of functional peatland ecosystems in previously degraded peatland sites. This was supported by calculation of bryophyte species abundance thresholds for WT. These results can be used to optimize restoration efforts in different peatland systems and as a qualitative conceptual basis for future restoration operations.

DT Article
AB 1. Modern records of 165 species of wetland beetle (Haliplidae, Hygrobiidae, Noteridae, Dytiscidae, Gyrinidae, Georissidae, Hydrochidae, Helophoridae, Hydrophilidae, Hydraenidae, Scirtidae, Dryopidae, Elmidae, Chrysomelidae, Curculionidae) were assembled for analysis.
   2. Two hundred and eighty nine modern lists of seven or more species of water beetle from sites in Ireland were subjected to multivariate analysis.
   3. Ten assemblage types were identified using TWINSPAN. Habitats typical of these assemblages are: A. deep rivers; B. rivers with riffles; C. puddles; D. canals and lakes with rich vegetation; E. ponds and ditches; F. turloughs; G. natural, minerotrophic fens; H. base-flushed cutover bogs; I. peat bogs; J. montane flushes. The distribution of these types is discussed.
   4. Ordination of site data by DECORANA indicated that the important environmental variables dictating water beetle assemblage type in Ireland were: flow; water permanence; exposure; type of substratum. Acidity could not be isolated as a determinant, except within the analysis of assemblage types conducted using TWINSPAN. DECORANA isolated one brackish site as an outlier but salinity was not otherwise a major factor, probably because few brackish sites were included in the analysis.
   5. The number of modern records for each species was used to provide a provisional set of species-quality scores. A simple rationale was devised to weight these scores in favour of relict species and against elusive species, species with short-lived adults and species primarily associated with man-made habitats.
   6. The average species-quality score per site and the number of species recorded were used to rank sites within each TWINSPAN end-group. The most diverse sites with the highest quality were some turloughs, rich fens and base-flushed peat cutting complexes. Some montane lakes and flushes with relatively few species had high species-quality scores.

AB Fens depend on inputs of groundwater or surface water. In Western Europe especially soligenous fens, receiving groundwater, are threatened by human hydrological intervention. We demonstrate the impact of artificial versus natural hydrologies on such fens by comparing 3 case areas: the Biebrza valley (reference) and the Gorecht and Vecht river plains (both reclaimed and drained). The patterns found in the fairly undisturbed Biebrza area suggest local water quality is governed by a strong regional groundwater flow emerging in the fen near the valley margins and seeping through it down to the river. Hence water quality gradients are smooth: there is little variation in water type over large distances. The pattern is determined by the natural geomorphology. In the reclaimed Vecht and Gorecht river plains large differences exist at short distance. Regional water flow from the adjacent ridges into the plains is weak here and governed primarily by water management (polders and pumping wells). However, the relations between specific water types and fen species and communities in this artificial pattern are quite similar to those found in the natural landscape. Low-productive rich fens are fed by calcium-rich and base-rich, nutrient-poor groundwater in both cases. While conservation of such rich fens is served best by maintaining the natural groundwater flow, some opportunities for restoration with an artificial hydrology are discussed.

AB Morphological structures of peatland mosses control moss water relations and the rate of water loss by drainage and evaporation, thus influencing their physiological functions. While many of these mechanisms are understood for Sphagnum mosses, there is a limited understanding of how these processes operate in Tomenthypnum nitens, a dominant brown moss species in northern rich fens. This study contrasts how different hydrophysical characteristics of Tomenthypnum and Sphagnum species affect capillary water flow that supports evaporation and productivity. Laboratory investigations indicate that volumetric water content (theta), gross ecosystem productivity, and evaporation decreased with water table depth for both mosses, with Sphagnum capitula retaining 10-20% more water (theta range of 0.18-0.32 cm(3) cm(-3)) than Tomenthypnum (0.07-0.16 cm(3) cm(-3)). Despite lower theta and a smaller fraction of pores between 66 and 661 mu m to retain water within the Tomenthypnum structure (10%) compared with Sphagnum (27%), both mosses had similar fractions of water conducting pore spaces and were able to maintain capillary rise throughout the experiment. While there was a larger difference in the bulk density and porosity of the Tomenthypnum moss compared with its underlying peat than there was in the Sphagnum profile, a layer of partially decomposed moss of intermediate properties was sufficient to provide a connection between the moss and peat under low water table conditions. In trying to characterize the soil-water pressure (psi) in near-surface mosses of Tomenthypnum based on measurements of vapour pressure, we found disequilibrium conditions that severely underestimated psi (i.e., very large negative pressures). It is this disequilibrium that drives evaporation and draws up capillary water to the moss surface for peatland-atmosphere carbon and water transfers.

DE BOG-FEN GRADIENT; HYDROLOGY; NORTH-CAROLINA; NUTRIENTS; PEATLANDS;
   POCOSINS
AB Soil chemistry and hydrology gradients are closely associated with and have often been cited as the causative agents for changes in wetland plant community composition. We analyzed the biogeochemistry and hydrology of three freshwater peatland communities on the North Carolina Coastal Plain-short pocosins, tall pocosins, and gum swamps. We compare this community gradient to the classical bog-fen gradient of northern peatlands. Short pocosins, in the ombrotrophic center of the raised bog complex, have the highest summer water table, with a large part of the peat profile remaining anaerobic throughout the year. They are highly nutrient-deficient with low levels of total and extractable P, N, and basic cations. They additionally have the greatest peat depth, with an organic matter content of ca. 95%. Tall pocosins have a highly seasonal water table, shallower peat depth, low soil nutrient levels, and an average soil organic matter content from 76 to 93% in the top 30 cm. Gum swamp forests have a highly seasonal water table and the shallowest peat depth. They are the most minerotrophic community, based on low organic matter and high N and P content of the soil, but have low levels of exchangeable Ca and Mg and low percent base saturation. All communities had low soil pH (< 4). Short pocosins and tall pocosins were effectively differentiated by seasonal hydrology and peat depth but not by soil characteristics, while the pocosins and swamp forest had large differences in seasonal hydrology, peat depth, percent organic matter, and soil nutrients.
   This community gradient contrasts sharply with the bog-fen gradient of northern peatlands, in which there is an increase in soil pH, basic cations, percent base saturation, and ash content, and a decrease in extractable N, P, and K. This biogeographical comparison suggests a need for further study of the nutrients likely to control plant growth in peatlands (i.e., P, N, and K), in addition to the historical emphasis on basic cations and pH.

AB Knowledge about trace elements such as mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), selenium (Se), and bismuth (Bi) in mire surface water is limited. We studied 105 surface water samples collected from 50 mires in the Changbai Mountains (CBM), northeastern China, investigated the characteristics of these five elements, and assessed the quality of the mire surface water. Hg and Sb in all investigated mires exceeded the guideline values (level V) for surface water set by the State Environmental Protection Administration of China by 92% and 2%, respectively. Inputs of Hg and Sb into surface water were predominantly derived from atmospheric wet deposition and following surface runoff at a regional scale. Concentrations of Sb were influenced by the acidity of mire water and were positively linked with As. Concentrations of As, Se, and Bi were within their allowable ranges (level I), and were not related to any investigated factors at a regional scale. At a local scale, As was influenced by redox conditions; Se was predominantly input from surface runoff; and concentrations of Bi decreased along with strong water table fluctuations and surface runoff. The water quality index (WQI) and the metal index (MI) indicated that 56% of mire surface water was poor for drinking, and 40% was moderately affected for agriculture and general landscape purposes. Early detection of potential risks from these trace elements to organisms is important, and attention should be predominantly paid to Hg and Sb in surface water of mires connected to principal local rivers and streams in these regions.

AB In areas where peatlands are abundant, they are likely to play a significant role in the hydrological and hydrogeological dynamics of a watershed. Although individual case studies are reported in the literature, there is a large range of aquifer-peatland interactions and there is a need to understand the controls of these interactions. The objectives of this study were (1) to better understand aquifer-peatland connections and how these may be predicted by geology and geomorphic location and (2) to provide a variety of reference sites for glacial geological settings. Slope and depression peatlands were studied in the Abitibi-Temiscamingue region and in the St. Lawrence Lowlands, two contrasting regions of southern Quebec. A total of 12 transects that span a shallow aquifer-peatland interface were instrumented with piezometers. Field investigations included peatland characterization, monthly water level monitoring, and continuous hydraulic head measurements with pressure transducers. The results indicate that 7 of the 12 transects receive groundwater from the surrounding shallow aquifer. At the peatland margin, four lateral flow patterns were identified and associated with slope peatlands (parallel inflow and divergent flow) and with depression peatlands (convergent flow and parallel outflow). Vertical hydraulic gradients suggest that water flows mainly downwards, i.e. from the peatland to the underlying mineral deposits. Vertical connectivity appears to decrease as the distance from the peatland margin increases. All of these exchanges are important components in the sustainability of peatland hydrogeological functions. The regional comparison of aquifer-peatland flow dynamics performed in this study provides a new set of referenced data for the assessment of aquifer-peatland connectivity.

DT Article
ID NITROGEN; BOG
AB The hydrological and geochemical aspects of the functioning and evolution of two small peatbogs located in Wielkopolska National Park were studied. The investigated peatlands are isolated from the influence of catchment ground waters. The main source of water supply is precipitation and surface run-off from the wooded catchment. Physical and chemical properties of the peatland waters are determined by hydrological conditions. Acid water reaction and low concentration of dissolved minerals suggest the peatlands should be classified as ombrotrophic high peatbogs.
   High concentrations of nutrients (especially phosphorus) were found in the peat waters. However, the bioavailability of the phosphorus is strongly limited due to the presence of humic substances and the low pH of the water. Statistical analysis revealed that the peatlands studied were chemically similar.

AB Peatlands are poorly represented in global Earth system modeling frameworks. Here we add a peatland-specific land surface hydrology module (PEAT-CLSM) to the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) of the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) framework. The amended TOPMODEL approach of the original CLSM that uses topography characteristics to model catchment processes is discarded, and a peatland-specific model concept is realized in its place. To facilitate its utilization in operational GEOS efforts, PEAT-CLSM uses the basic structure of CLSM and the same global input data. Parameters used in PEAT-CLSM are based on literature data. A suite of CLSM and PEAT-CLSM simulations for peatland areas between 40 degrees N and 75 degrees N is presented and evaluated against a newly compiled data set of groundwater table depth and eddy covariance observations of latent and sensible heat fluxes in natural and seminatural peatlands. CLSM's simulated groundwater tables are too deep and variable, whereas PEAT-CLSM simulates a mean groundwater table depth of -0.20 m (snow-free unfrozen period) with moderate temporal fluctuations (standard deviation of 0.10 m), in significantly better agreement with in situ observations. Relative to an operational CLSM version that simply includes peat as a soil class, the temporal correlation coefficient is increased on average by 0.16 and reaches 0.64 for bogs and 0.66 for fens when driven with global atmospheric forcing data. In PEAT-CLSM, runoff is increased on average by 38% and evapotranspiration is reduced by 19%. The evapotranspiration reduction constitutes a significant improvement relative to eddy covariance measurements.

ID RETENTION
AB Minerotrophic peatlands play an important role in the regulation of water quality and quantity but due to drainage and agricultural land use most of these systems have lost this function. In Central Europe, many re-wetting projects have been implemented to restore wetlands for multifunctional purposes during the last years. The Pohnsdorfer Stauung (Northern Germany) is a eutrophic fen which was used for intensive agriculture for 40 years. The peatland is divided in two subareas by a small stream. In the scope of re-wetting measures, one subarea (westpolder) was flooded by blockading the main drainage ditch in 1996/97, a second subarea (eastpolder) was re-connected to the stream by an inlet and outlet in 2001. Nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics were investigated in the surface water of these systems over a 5-year (westpolder) and 3-year (eastpolder) period, and balances were calculated. In both polders high dynamics of nitrogen and phosphate concentrations were observed in the surface water. Nitrate peaked in the winter months, whereas ammonium, phosphate and organically bound nitrogen (No,,) revealed highest values during summer. Daily balances for the eastpolder and annual balances for both polders were calculated. In both polders nitrate was retained but phosphate and N-org were exported. Differences of the nutrient dynamics and the absolute and relative balances between the polders were due to the different hydrology: the eastpolder received a high nitrate load by the stream, in the westpolder nutrient loads are low and internal nutrient cycles are dominating. During the summer months, high ammonium concentrations, oxygen depletion, and phosphate release occur in the warm, stagnant water of both polders. Normally, high phosphate and ammonium concentrations did not coincided with discharge phases from the polders. However, in August 2002 after heavy rainfall high phosphorus and ammonium discharge was observed. One important factor influencing the detected nutrient dynamics and balances is the change from a drained and fertilized peatland to a flooded wetland in only a few years. We conclude that continuous water flow and stable water levels are desired for flooded peatlands to prevent high concentrations of ammonium and phosphate and to utilize the potential for nitrate retention. In degenerated peatlands, flooding should only be regarded as an easy technological solution in order to conserve the peat mineralization, and to form the foundation for the further development of the peatland to a more efficient nutrient retaining system.

AB To assess whether short-term changes in mire vegetation can be detected using the phytosociological approach, paired vegetation relev,s from two surveys of 112 mire sites of Switzerland were assigned to phytosociological alliances through a numerical approach. About 30% of the plots were assigned to different alliances in the two surveys. These transitions were analysed based on species frequencies and interpreted ecologically using Landolt's indicator values. Transitions between different alliances were more frequently related to the appearance of new species rather than to the disappearance of species. Transitions from and to peat bog communities were frequent. Many plots with fen vegetation were transformed into other wetland types. Fen-grassland increased in abundance, mainly at the cost of small-sedge fens. To re-establish the function of the Swiss mires as peat producers, we recommend to raise the mean summer water table to a maximum depth of 10 cm.

TI EXTREME-FLOOD-RELATED PEAT BLOCKS: AN ANTHROPOCENE ANALOGUE TO ANCIENT
   COAL- FORMING ENVIRONMENTS
SO JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Coal clasts associated with extreme floods are prone to survive and maintain their large size, contrary to the general belief that distance from the parent peat layer reduces the size of transported clasts. Contrary to apparent logic, moreover, a second flood event favors the preservation potential of such soft organic clasts, this being the minimal fragmentation. An Anthropocene example from an urban park in Spain demonstrates that peat clasts up to 1 m long can survive due to flotation for a distance of almost a hundred meters and are well preserved and stabilized thanks to a second flood. These peat blocks were generated by catastrophic flooding of urban peatlands along the Ebro River (city of Zaragoza) during exceptional rainfalls in Iberia. The water flow from the Ebro River flooded the peatland at the surface of the meander, ripping up peat clasts from a shear or detachment level formed by an indurated level characterized by rounded quartzite pebbles, which acted as a hydrological discontinuity surface. Extensive evidence of the paleoflow direction is provided by oriented crushed reeds and the widespread occurrence of imbricated and thrusted peat blocks on the eroded and exposed peatland and in the main urban accumulation areas. To be specific, peat blocks and minor clasts accumulated in four areas associated with different modes of transport and topographic steps. From proximal to distal these are as follows: i) a proximal rim including thrusted peat blocks on the eroded peatland, ii) two intermediate accumulation zones associated with topographic steps in the park, characterized by peat-clast imbrication, iii) gravity-fall peat dusts deposited in an artificial channel in the park, and iv) peat rafts of more than 1 m in diameter scattered over the surface of the park (at a distance of 90 m from the eroded peatland).

AB Pristine peat soils are characterized by large porosity, low density and large water and organic matter contents. Drainage and management practices change peat properties by oxidation, compaction and mineral matter additions. This study examined differences in physical properties (hydraulic conductivity, water retention curve, bulk density, porosity, von Post degree of decomposition) in soil profiles of two peatland forests, a cultivated peatland, a peat extraction area and two pristine mires originally within the same peatland area. Soil hydraulic conductivity of the drained sites (median hydraulic conductivities: 3.3 x 10(-5) m/s, 2.9 x 10(-8) m/s and 8.5 x 10(-8) m/s for the forests, the cultivated site and the peat extraction area, respectively) was predicted better by land use option than by soil physical parameters. Detailed physical measurements were accompanied by monitoring of the water levels between drains. The model 'DRAINMOD' was used to assess the hydrology and the rapid fluctuations seen in groundwater depths. Hydraulic conductivity values needed to match the simulation of observed depth to groundwater data were an order of magnitude greater than those determined in field measurements, suggesting that macropore flow was an important pathway at the study sites. The rapid response of depth to groundwater during rainfall events indicated a small effective porosity and this was supported by the small measured values of drainable porosity. This study highlighted the potential role of land use and macropore flow in controlling water table fluctuation and related processes in peat soils.

AB Spatial surface patterns of hummocks, hollows, ridges, and pools (microtopography) are common features of many northern peatlands and are particularly distinct within the vast peatlands of the Hudson Bay Lowland (HBL), Canada. Hypotheses and models describe how small-scale feedbacks among vegetation, hydrology, and nutrients cause spatial differences in peat accumulation that enable microforms and surface patterns to develop over time. Empirical tests of the predictions from theoretical models of these proposed feedback mechanisms are limited, particularly in large peatland complexes such as the HBL. We investigate feedbacks controlling peatland structure and function in an ombrogenous bog and a minerogenous fen in the HBL. Our sites represent surface patterns found in many northern peatlands, specifically spatially irregular hummocks and hollows, and parallel ridges and pools that are perpendicular to slope. We found the occurrence of different spatial patterns depends on position within a peat landform, with these differences attributed to the ecohydrological setting. In turn, the ecohydrological setting, with different water table depths, nutrient availability, and species composition, influences the strength and direction of feedback mechanisms at the microform scale. Our data support the prediction of a positive feedback between plant productivity and acrotelm thickness for peat accumulation and hummock growth and that this may be enhanced by water ponding on slopes to form ridge-pool tracks. We did not find evidence to support the proposed feedback among evapotranspiration-driven transport of water and nutrients for the development of hummocks. Our results suggest a combination of mechanisms operating at various temporal and spatial scales is associated with the development of surface patterns in northern peatlands.

AB Over the past century, mires and peatlands have faced a wide range of degradation by artificial drainage, making them one of the most threatened ecosystems in Europe. However, restoration of drained peatlands has gained much importance over the last three decades, mostly due to the multiple ecosystem services they provide such as carbon storage, habitat provision and water flow regulation. Although there has been an increased focus on such ecosystems, spatial research on hydrophysical soil properties following rewetting in coastal mires is lacking. Therefore, the objectives of the study were to understand the spatial structures of hydrophysical properties of organic soils and spatial patterns of organic matter accumulation in relation to soil surface microtopography. Soil organic matter content (SOM) and hydraulic conductivity (K-s) of topsoils (0-28 cm), along with soil textures of the underlying mineral substrate, were investigated in a rewetted non-tidal coastal flood mire (Baltic Sea). The results indicate that the organic horizon with its relatively low K-s acts as a hydrological barrier to infiltration. Soil organic matter content (SOM), K-s and soil surface microtopography are all spatially auto-correlated within 100, 87 and 53 m, respectively. Bivariate Moran's I revealed a positive but weak spatial correlation between SOM and K-s and a moderately strong negative spatial correlation between SOM and soil surface microtopography. A map of SOM was generated using simple kriging, which predicts higher SOM in the centre of the ecosystem, at lower elevations; and lower SOM at the edges of the study area, at higher elevations. Local depressions in the centre of the ecosystem provide a wetter and therefore more anaerobic environment, thereby decreasing carbon mineralisation rates and enabling peat accumulation. The low hydraulic conductivity of the degraded peat in the presence of lower micro-elevations in the centre of the ecosystem is likely to increase the residence time of floodwater and thus may enhance (new) peat accumulation. Thus, we conclude that, for the restoration of non-tidal coastal mires where flooding events are not as frequent, K-s and soil surface microtopography are even more important factors to consider than for tidal systems.

AB Hydrophysical properties of peat influence the partitioning of rainfall into infiltration versus runoff, determine water flow and solute transport patterns, and regulate the carbon and nitrogen cycles in peatlands. Compared with mineral soils, our understanding of hydraulic properties of peat soils is limited, especially of the temporal dynamics of peat properties. A data set of peat subsidence as well as the bulk density (BD) change rate following artificial drainage was assembled from the literature. The collected data cover a time period of up to 272 years of land drainage for forestry and agriculture in boreal and temperate climate zones. The results show that the subsidence rate and BD change rate, and hydrophysical properties of peat can be estimated based on land drainage duration and land use. The most severe shift in pore structure of peat occurs within the first 20 years of land drainage. Peatland drainage reduces macroporosity with pore diameter greater than 50 mu m, but increases the volume of pores <5 mu m. In the long term, peat thickness loss is responsible for more than 80% of water storage loss. In conclusion, the derived functions between subsidence rate, BD change rate, and drainage duration provide a new approach to estimate the hydrophysical properties of peat (pore structure, saturated hydraulic conductivity, specific yield, and soil water storage) on a centennial scale. The derived hydrophysical parameter values can be used for long-term hydrological modeling, especially if measured hydraulic parameters of peat are not available.

AB Forested peatlands store significant amounts of soil carbon (C) compared with upland forests and are strongly influenced by climatic parameters. Carbon stocks at peatland margins, although likely to be most sensitive to changes in climate, have not been well quantified, making it difficult to predict their response to climate change. The purpose of this study was to characterize the physical environment and associated changes in C stocks across the forested margins of two boreal fens. Peat depth increased and water table depth decreased toward the peatland centre, and these parameters acted as the controlling environmental variables. Above-ground biomass C was primarily derived from tree biomass and decreased from upland to peadand, despite an opposite trend in understorey (herbaceous and shrubby) biomass stocks. Leaf area index was related to peat depth through a negative power function and increased linearly with above-ground tree biomass. Total ecosystem C increased from upland to peatland, with minimum and maximum values of 270 and 2100 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, and was largely dominated by soil C stocks, even at the upland end of the gradient. Although numerous small trees toward the peatland interior might allow a rapid increase in tree biomass C with lowering water tables, it seems likely that this would be a limited response, overshadowed in the long term by declines in the more substantial soil C stocks.

AB Water-table reconstructions from Holocene peatlands are increasingly being used as indicators of terrestrial palaeoclimate in many regions of the world. However, the links between peatland water tables, climate, and long-term peatland development are poorly understood. Here we use a combination of high-resolution proxy climate data and a model of long-term peatland development to examine the relationship between rapid hydrological fluctuations in peatlands and climatic forcing. We show that changes in water-table depth can occur independently of climate forcing. Ecohydrological feedbacks inherent in peatland development can lead to a degree of homeostasis that partially disconnects peatland water-table behaviour from external climatic influences. We conclude by suggesting that further work needs to be done before peat-based climate reconstructions can be used to test climate models. Citation: Swindles, G. T., P. J. Morris, A. J. Baird, M.

AB Plant macrofossil and testate amoebae analyses were conducted on a sedimentary core taken from a headwater peatland located near the summit of a hill at the northern extension of the Adirondack Mountains (Quebec, Canada). The aims were to reconstruct the developmental stages of the peatland and to examine the allogenous and autogenous factors associated with its long-term dynamics. Results were compared with a quantitative paleodimatic reconstruction based on the modern analog technique using pollen data from the same core. The long-term development of the peatland (pond-rich fen-intermediate fen-poor fen-bog) mainly reflects an autogenous hydroseral succession. Active peat accumulation under the relatively dry climate of the Early Holocene suggests that summer temperature was a critical factor in peat accumulation through enhanced biomass production. A major long-term decrease in net peat accumulation rates and a progressive decline of mean water-table depth occurred during the Mid- to late-Holocene (7900-500 cal yr BP), even though annual precipitation was abundant at the time. The high summer temperature associated to the highest evapotranspiration rates maintained a low water table which in turn led to strong humification of the peat. A similar, synchronous pattern in vertical peat accumulation dynamics characterized another nearby peatland. Based on these results, we suggest that small peatlands situated atop a watershed and/or within a small watershed are ecosystems sensitive to changes in precipitation and/or evapotranspiration, due to their limited water supply.

AB Methane fluxes were studied at two high-elevation oligotrophic peat bogs in the Ore Mts., Czech Republic. The Bukova dolina Bog was drained 15 years ago and 2 years ago was partly restored, whereas the Brumiste Bog is an intact peatland. Draining led to a change of vegetation structure, dominated by Molinia caerulea, Carex sp., and forestation by Norway spruce. Methane fluxes were measured monthly from April to November 2011 using a closed chamber. Temperature and presence of Carex were significant controls on methane fluxes. Peat depth, water table and the presence of other plant species had no significant effect on CH4 emissions. Methane emissions ranged from 9 to 2700 mg/m(2)/day at the degraded and from 3 to 260 mg/m(2)/day at the intact bog. In general, the degraded peat bog emitted three times more methane compared to the intact peat bog, likely due to vegetation changes after long-term artificial draining.

AB Question: Recognizing water table dynamics in wetlands is crucial for understanding species-environment relationships, ecosystem function and changes during restoration. The PVC tape discolouration method enables spatially and temporally extensive studies of reductive conditions associated with longterm water table dynamics in peat soils. The reliability of the method has been verified only for ombrotrophic bogs, even though wide usage can be expected in minerotrophic fens. Location: Trebon basin, Czech Republic.
   Methods: Using data from 49 plots in six poor and moderately rich fens, we correlated the directly measured lowest, highest and mean water table depths and the same variables indicated by discolouration of PVC tape attached to green bamboo stakes installed vertically in the soil profile.
   Results: The depth to the first sign of PVC discolouration was highly correlated with the directly measured position of the highest water table, the correlation between the depth of complete discolouration and the directly measured position of the lowest water table was poorer. The accuracy of the minimum water table measurement depended on the depth of the peat layer. Surprisingly, the depth at which the green bamboo stakes turned brown correlated highly with the minimum water table.
   Conclusions: The PVC tape discolouration method reliably indicates water table maxima in fens, but minima are not accurately indicated. The depth of the green bamboo discolouration is suggested as a new alternative indicator of the minimum water table, even in fens and mineral soils. Combining both methods enables efficient monitoring of water table dynamics at a large number of mire sites.

AB Post-mine landscape reclamation of the Athabasca Oil Sands Region requires the use of tailings sand, an abundant mine-waste material that often contains large amounts of sodium (Na). Due to the mobility of Na in groundwater and its effects on vegetation, water quality is a concern when incorporating mine waste materials, especially when attempting to construct groundwater-fed peatlands. This research is the first published account of Na redistribution in groundwater from a constructed tailings sand upland to an adjacent constructed fen peat deposit (Nikanotee Fen). A permeable petroleum coke layer underlying the fen, extending partway into the upland, was important in directing flow and Na beneath the peat, as designed. Initially, Na+ concentration was highest in the tailings sand (average of 232 mg L-1) and lowest in fen peat (96 mg L-1). Precipitation-driven recharge to the upland controlled the mass flux of Na from upland to fen, which ranged from 2 to 13 tons Na per year. The mass flux was highest in the driest summer, in part from dry-period flowpaths that direct groundwater with higher concentrations of Na into the coke layer, and in part because of the high evapotranspiration loss from the fen in dry periods, which induces upward water flow. With the estimated flux rates of 336 mm yr 1, the Na arrival time to the fen surface was estimated to be between 4 and 11 years. Over the four-year study, average Na concentrations within the fen rooting zone increased from 87 to 200 mg L-1, and in the tailings sand decreased to 196 mg L-1. The planting of more salt-tolerant vegetation in the fen is recommended, given the potential for Na accumulation. This study shows reclamation designs can use layered flow system to control the rate, pattern, and timing of solute interactions with surface soil systems.

AB This study demonstrates the importance of the including and appropriately parameterizing peatlands and forestlands for basin-scale integrated surface-subsurface models in the northern boreal forest, with particular emphasis on the Athabasca River Basin (ARB). With a long-term water balance approach to the ARB, we investigate reasons why downstream mean annual stream flow rates are consistently higher than upstream, despite the subhumid water deficit conditions in the downstream regimes. A high-resolution 3D variably saturated subsurface and surface water flow and evapotranspiration model of the ARB is constructed based on the bedrock and surficial geology and the spatial distribution of peatlands and their corresponding eco-regions. Historical climate data were used to drive the model for calibration against 40-year long-term average surface flow and groundwater observations during the historic instrumental period. The simulation results demonstrate that at the basin-scale, peatlands and forestlands can have a strong influence on the surface-subsurface hydrologic systems. In particular, peatlands in the midstream and downstream regimes of the ARB increase the water availability to the surface-subsurface water systems by reducing water loss through evapotranspiration. Based on the comparison of forestland evapotranspiration between observation and simulation, the overall spatial average evapotranspiration in downstream forestlands is larger than that in peatlands and thus the water contribution to the stream flow in downstream areas is relatively minor. Therefore, appropriate representation of peatlands and forestlands within the basin-scale hydrologic model is critical to reproduce the water balance of the ARB.

AB Mine reclamation landscapes typically comprise layers of mine waste materials such as tailings sands, capped with a cover soil. In addition to the arrangement and placement of these materials, their hydraulic properties govern the performance of the built system. Soil evolution due to freeze-thaw cycling can result in dramatically altered soil hydraulic properties compared to the as-built material. Therefore, prediction of present and future hydrologic behaviour relies on understanding the nature and magnitude of this change and the elapsed time associated with stabilization. This research quantifies the transient hydraulic properties of mine reclamation materials at a constructed upland within a reclaimed watershed, and models the effect of this evolution on the partitioning of soil moisture between evaporation and groundwater recharge. Soil moisture dynamics were simulated using HYDRUS-1D for the ice-free period two, three, and five years after construction. A capillary barrier between the fine-grained cover soil and coarse-grained tailings sand regulated percolation past the interface. Soil evolution of the cover soil was responsible for an increase in saturated hydraulic conductivity by an order of magnitude, decrease in air-entry pressure by a factor of 4, and decrease in the van Genuchten n parameter by a factor of 2. The altered soil hydraulic properties associated with the weathered cover soil ultimately resulted in a 64% increase in groundwater recharge as a consequence of the capillary barrier weakening. The cover soil exhibited minor spatial heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties, and did not contribute substantial uncertainty to the estimates of groundwater recharge and evaporation. Cover soil thickness exerted a strong influence on the partitioning of soil moisture. Reclaimed uplands will provide the most recharge to downgradient ecosystems in the period following the completion of soil evolution (similar to 4 years) but preceding substantial vegetation development.

AB In the Alps, mires, ranging from fens to bogs, are rare habitats mainly restricted to high elevation ranges where anthropogenic pressures are relatively low. However, they are threatened by multiple impacts, among which intensive cattle grazing and draining predominate. In particular, overgrazing effects are still poorly explored and we urgently need an assessment of the conservation status of these sensitive habitats in high elevation grazed areas. In this study, 85 small and large mires (min-max 0.12-8.69 ha) were surveyed in the Southern Alps using bryophytes as indicators of impacts and recording environmental descriptors to interpret both the ecology of the species and the environmental impacts. Results revealed a high diversity of bryophytes (77 taxa, 25 of which were Sphagnum) and allowed to clarify the environmental factors affecting their distribution (elevation, pH, conductivity, and depth to the water table), and the main threats. In particular, cattle trampling was the most impacting factor which decreased both the variability of bryophyte composition and the occurrence of rare species. Drainage was the second most important disturbance, the effects of which were interpreted along the dry-wet gradient of the species preference. Only 35 % of the mires were pristine thus posing concern on the effectiveness of local management policies to protect these rare and sensitive habitats in the Southern Alps.

Research into milled peat stockpile rewetting has shown that while there is surface rewetting (a wet layer), there is also significant through-flow water movement into the center of the stockpile with associated zones (termed fingers) of water storage. A method of quantifying the importance of finger storage was developed using serial digital images obtained in the field. Results showed that the wetted volume within a stockpile was similar regardless of milled peat type (approximate to 40%), and that the infernal wetting contributed up to 28 times more to final water content than the surface wet layer. Thus surface wet layers have relatively little economic impact when compared with finger storage. Field observation of through-now indicated that a rivulet now mechanism in conjunction with stockpile geometry contributes to the development of fingers.

AB Transient high pore-water pressures, up to 50 cm higher than ambient pressure, developed over the summer season at various depths in a shallow (1 m) fen peat. The excess pressures had a pattern of gradual increases and sharp drops, and their initiation and release typically corresponded to abrupt changes in atmospheric pressure. We conclude that these phenomena depend on gas bubbles (probably methane) generated by biological activity, both by clogging pores and by building up pressure as they grow. These transient and spatially discontinuous high-pressure zones were found using pressure transducers in sealed (backfilled) pits, but not in piezometers open to the atmosphere. Piezometers may provide a conduit for the release of gas and pressure, thus rendering them unsuitable for measuring this phenomenon. Although the development of localized zones of high pressure causes erratic and unpredictable hydraulic gradients, we suggest that their effect on the flow of water or solutes is offset by the reduced permeability caused by the bubbles, which allows them to be sustained. These zones, however, probably deflect flows driven by the dominant hydraulic gradients. Furthermore, they may cause the peat volume to adjust (swell). The use and interpretation of traditional methods for estimating hydraulic head and conductivity in peat soils thus require great caution. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB This study provides new information on beta diversity (variation in species composition across space) of three invertebrate groups (Clitellata, Plecoptera, and Chironomidae) on a small, within-site spatial scale. It was conducted at small-sized spring fens where two contrasting mesohabitats, a flowing-water and a standing-water, can be clearly distinguished. Besides flow conditions, these habitats differed in the amounts of inorganic substratum and dissolved oxygen.
   Factors related to flow conditions (dissolved oxygen and water temperature) influenced the composition of the studied assemblages at both mesohabitats, while substratum features were important at the standing-water habitat. The water chemistry was important for Clitellata at both mesohabitats and for Chironomidae at the flowing-water.
   Using a new approach of disentangling beta diversity into two components (species replacement and species richness differences), clear difference in beta diversity patterns among the three assemblages were found, despite their roughly equal total beta diversities. Variation in species composition of those assemblages strongly limited by flow conditions (Plecoptera and partly Clitellata) was induced by differences in species richness, while replacement governed the variation in species rich assemblages that were able to utilise a wide range of conditions (Chironomidae and partly Clitellata). These results indicate that the size of species pool and the level of environmental filtering play an important role in forming beta diversity patterns, and caution that the same amount of beta diversity can be promoted by essentially different mechanisms, even at a very fine spatial scale with no involvement of dispersal limitations.

AB The detailed groundwater flow and water chemistry to illustrate landscape structure of the infertile peatless mire by using piezometers and groundwater wells were measured. The instruments were installed in lines through a small spring-fed wetland underlying little peat from the hillslope to the valley bottom in southwestern Japan. Flow net and EC data clearly indicated that the wetland was situated in a high-EC groundwater upspring area. The low-productivity graminous vegetation was related with four hydrological factors such as : (1) high water level; (2) low-EC ( < 25 micro S/cm) groundwater; (3) weakly upward hydraulic gradient; and (4) overflowing of negatively pressured groundwater. In other words, the "old or deep groundwater" constructed the foundation of slope-wetland, and maintained the high groundwater level. In contrast, overflowing "youthful groundwater" is supplied from head of slope-wetland preferentially through the shallow substratum. The plant communities of the peatless mire in southwestern Japan are similar to those of raised bog in northern cool temperate Japan. There have been some reports verifying that the underlying mineral substrata of such wetlands were quartzile rocks such as granite, rhyolite, chart and well-leached sand. Results showed (1) low cation availability affects the water acidity; (2) upward seepage of high-EC groundwater composed the foundation of the investigated peatless mire; and (3) the poor mineral condition seems to play a similar role to northern ombrotrophic(rain-fed) condition.

AB Major factors affecting sediment erosion from peat mines were assessed to provide information on the peat delivery mechanism. Surface runoff and erosion from three plots of 100 m(2) were measured in the field using three different rainfall intensities varying from 0.58-4.38 mm/min. The settling of peat was studied in the laboratory using a settling column. The settling of peat increased with the wetness of the pest. Within the range of the characteristics studied, water temperature and sediment concentration did not change the settling velocity. The erosion process exhibits three different time dependent stages. First, the sediment concentration decreases rapidly from the onset of runoff due to a decrease in erosion by rainfall as more water is added to the surface. During constant surface runoff and rainfall, the erosion decreases due to a decrease in rill development. When the precipitation ceases, the decrease is more pronounced. Ditch erosion is highest in ditches where there is floating peat or the bed material consists of mineral soils. Results obtained in this study suggests that efficient sediment control procedure includes runoff detention during the early stage of a runoff event and the continuous pounding of water above the erodible bed deposits.

AB Sulfur pollution can lead to serious problems in freshwater wetlands, including phosphorus eutrophication and sulfide toxicity. We tested the effects of anaerobic iron-rich groundwater discharge in fens, simulated by iron injection, on two characteristic species (Juncus effusus and Caltha palustris) in a sulfidic environment. Biomass production of C. palustris roots showed an optimum response to the combined addition of iron and sulfide, with highest values at intermediate concentrations of both substances. Iron deficiency apparently occurred at low iron concentrations, while at high iron concentrations, growth was decreased. For J. effusus, in contrast, no toxic effects were found of both iron and sulfide. This could be explained by larger radial oxygen loss (ROL) of J. effusus and could not be explained by differences in phosphorous concentrations. The results of our experiments confirm that iron-rich groundwater discharge has the potential to affect vegetation composition through toxicity modification in sulfidic environments.

AB Evaporation from mosses and lichens can form a major component of the water balance, especially in ecosystems where mosses and lichens often grow abundantly, such as tundra, deserts and bogs. To facilitate moss representation in hydrological models, we parameterized the unsaturated hydraulic properties of mosses and lichens such that the capillary water flow through moss and lichen material during evaporation could be assessed. We derived the Mualem-van Genuchten parameters of the drying retention and the hydraulic conductivity functions of four xerophilous moss species and one lichen species. The shape parameters of the retention functions (2.17<n<2.35 and 0.08<<0.13cm(-1)) ranged between values that are typical for sandy loam and loamy sand. The shapes of the hydraulic conductivity functions of moss and lichen species diverged from those of mineral soils, because of strong negative pore-connectivity parameters (-2.840<l<-2.175) and low hydraulic conductivities at slightly negative pressure heads (0.016<K-0<0.280cm/d). These K-0 values are surprisingly low, considering that mosses are very porous. However, during evaporation, large pores and voids were air filled and did not participate in capillary water flow. Small K-0 values cause mosses and lichens to be conservative with water during wet conditions, thus tempering evaporation compared to mineral soils. On the other hand, under dry conditions, mosses and lichens are able to maintain a moisture supply from the soil, leading to a higher evaporation rate than mineral soils. Hence, the modulating effect of mosses on evaporation possibly differs between wet and dry climates. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Diatoms collected from 113 surface peat samples from the Boreal Shield and Hudson Plains show taxonomic distributions that are associated with macro-vegetation type, pH, and position relative to the water table, the main environmental variables measured in this study. The overall goal of our research was to determine the ecological distribution and response of diatoms to microhabitat conditions, and to assess the potential for diatoms to be applied as indicators of long-term environmental change in northern peatlands. Our results indicate that diatom assemblage composition was determined by both the broader peatland type (i.e., bog, rich and poor fens) and microhabitats within peatland formations (e.g., hummock, hollow). The diatom assemblages were primarily influenced by pH with the sites divided at a critical pH of 5.5, and secondarily by the depth to the water table. Acidic bog hollow and hummock microhabitats were species-poor and dominated almost exclusively by Eunotia paludosa A.Grunow and (or) Eunotia mucophila (H.Lange-Bertalot, M.Norpel-Schempp & E.Alles) H.Lange-Bertalot. These acidophilic and aerophilic diatom species were associated with the narrow pH optima of the dominant Sphagnum L. species (e. g., Sphagnum fuscum (Schimp.) Klinggr., Sphagnum angustifolium (C.E.O.Jensen ex Russow) C.E.O.Jensen) found in these bog habitats. Rich and poor fen samples, which were less acidic, supported a more diverse diatom assemblage (>30 species) with greater variability in both diatom and bryophyte pH tolerances. The diatom assemblages recorded in the bogs and fens of our study are similar to those found in peatlands around the world, demonstrating that diatom species are very specialized to exist in these often harsh semi-aquatic environments. Diatoms from peatlands have great potential as biomonitors of environmental change in these important ecosystems.

AB In the zone of discontinuous permafrost, the cycling and storage of water within and between wetlands is poorly understood. The presence of intermittent permafrost bodies tends to impede and re-direct the flow of water. In this region, the landscape is characterized by forested peat plateaus that are underlain by permafrost and are interspersed by permafrost-free wetlands. These include channel fens which convey water to the basin outlet through wide, hydraulically rough channels and flat bogs which are typically thought to retain moisture inputs as storage. Field studies conducted at a peatland-dominated landscape near Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories, Canada, indicate the presence of ephemeral drainage channels that form a cascade of connected bogs that ultimately discharges into a channel fen. Consequently, understanding bogs as dynamic transmitters of surface and subsurface flows, rather than simple storage regions, calls for further examination. Whether bogs act as either storage features or flow through features has a direct impact on the runoff contributing area in a basin. Here, two adjacent series of bog cascades were gauged over two consecutive years to determine spatial and temporal changes in effective runoff contributing areas. It was found that runoff varies significantly between two adjacent bog cascades with one cascade producing 125mm of runoff over the 2-year period, while the other yielded only 25mm. The bog cascades are primarily active during the snowmelt season when moisture conditions are high; however flows can also be generated in response to large rain events. It is proposed that bog cascades operate under an element threshold concept' whereby in order for water to be transmitted through a bog, the depression storage capacity of that bog must first be satisfied. Our work indicates that whether bogs act as storage features or flow-through features has a direct impact on the runoff contributing area in a basin. Neglecting to represent connected bogs as dynamic transmission features in the landscape is shown to underestimate water available for streamflow by between 5 and 15%, and these systems are therefore a key component of the water balance in discontinuous permafrost regions.

AB End-member mixing analysis (EMMA) and isotopes of water (deuterium and oxygen-18) are used to describe hydrologic processes for six boreal forest catchments in the discontinuous permafrost of northern Alberta. The data presented in this paper represent pre-disturbance conditions during two average precipitation years for small basins where the impacts of clear cut harvesting will be evaluated in future work. Hydrologic patterns and soil water sources were different between the two streams draining sloped catchments and the four streams draining flat lowlands. In sloped catchments, snowmelt discharged rapidly prior to loss of soil frost. Snowmelt discharge initially contained between 70 and 90% water from mineral soils and peatlands. As melt progressed, soil water was replaced by surface or near-surface runoff comprising 50-80% of stream discharge. Surface storage of snowmelt in sloped catchments was minimal and summer stream discharge was dominated by rainfall routed through organic and mineral soils (34 and 46%, respectively). Surface runoff averaged 20% of total discharge throughout the summer but rose to 60% of discharge following large storms. In contrast, snowmelt was stored in lowland catchments; peak snowmelt discharge was 30-66% of summer peak discharge and was an equal mix of older groundwater and snowmelt. In lowland catchments, watertables and stream flow declined through the summer and summer discharge was increasingly dominated (> 50%) by groundwater routed through organic soils.

AB The post-glacial areas are characterized by favorable conditions for the formation of wetlands as a result of the widespread occurrence of depressions without outflow - center for the development of wetlands. The studies of morphogenetic conditions of the wetland development in Volhynian Polissia within the territory of Ukraine and the formation of their water regime reveal several features of their distribution and typological variety. The location of wetlands were characterized in reference to the shape of base/subsoil and its lithology. The typical structure of post-lacustrine, paludificational, riverside and spring peatlands of the Volhynian Polissia were shown and their development were also discussed. The wetland evolution under the influence of the postglacial landscape degradation leads to disappearance of the depression wetlands in glacial forms, increase of the peat bog trophicity and the level of peat dissolution. The supply conditions and characteristics of water regime are determined for separate peatlands. According to the origin and water flow/supply four types of wetland were extracted: ombrogenic, topogenic, soligenic and fluviogenic. It was found that the reasons of the high marshes areas (21%) in Volhynian Polissia are the geological and geomorphological conditions retaining/stopping the runoff and also local groundwater circulation system.

AB 1 Blanket mire in Northern Ireland is an ecologically threatened habitat in which land use for hand peat-cutting, forestry and agriculture has had a major influence. A recent land use change is the introduction of tractor-powered peat-harvesting. In this paper, the effect of machine peat-cutting on ombrotrophic blanket mire vegetation is assessed from a regional sample of cut and uncut plots.
   2 Principal components analysis identified watertable depth and grazing intensity as major factors influencing the species composition of uncut mire. A key variable affecting the composition of machine-cut mire across the drainage gradient was the number of times cut, with multiple annual cutting causing progressive decreases in acrotelm depth, catotelm bulk density and plant cover. Ericaceous species and Sphagnum spp. were particularly sensitive to cutting, with Eriophorum angustifolium and Campylopus introflexus characteristic of multiple-cut sites.
   3 Redundancy analysis, with number of times cut partialled out, showed that recovery time accounted for a significant amount of variance in vegetation composition. Species that significantly increased in abundance with recovery time were Sphagnum spp., Odontoschisma sphagni, Erica tetralix and Drosera rotundifolia.
   4 Sites cut frequently, or which were grazed, recovered more slowly. Recovery from cutting was partly dependent on the post-cutting structure of the mire surface and the species that survive cutting. The rate of recovery on sites cut once, then abandoned, is relatively rapid compared with multiple-cut sites where species colonization is constrained by bare compacted peat.

AB The abiotic conditions and fen vegetation in three lowland mires were analysed. Two of these mires are in the Netherlands. They have deteriorated considerably as a result of human pressure. One mire complex is in Poland. Its hydrology is almost undisturbed. The variation in the water composition in the fens was associated with the variation in the amount of regional groundwater discharge originating from the uplands, and to a lesser extent by the infiltration of polluted water pumped into the fens.
   The 26 vegetation types ranged from poor fen to eutrophic reedland. Most types were typical for only one region.
   There were clear differences between the three regions. Both the species composition and the water quality for the vegetation types indicated that the fens in the Vecht river plain are eutrophicated, whereas the fens in Northwestern Overijssel suffer from acidification. The Biebrza valley fens are well developed and are mainly fed by fresh calcareous groundwater.
   Stepwise logistic regression performed on 28 fen species revealed that the hydrochemical variables explained only a part of the variance: the regional variable 'area' explained a considerable amount of the variance for most species. In 27% of the cases it was possible to fit an optimum curve for the species response to relevant hydrochemical variables. Monotonic curves could be fitted in 64% of the cases; mostly they described the response to variables in a way that is supported by ecological literature. It was concluded that the dataset should be constructed differently to enable the calculation of generally applicable standards.

AB In five tributary streams (four inflowing and one outflowing) of 1600-ha Trout Lake in northern Wisconsin, USA, we examined factors that can affect the magnitude of stream flow and transport of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC) through the streams to the lake. One catchment, the Allequash Creek basin, was investigated in more detail to describe the dynamics of carbon flow and to identify potential carbon sources. Stream flows and carbon loads showed little or no relation to surface-water catchment area. They were more closely related to ground-water watershed area because ground-water discharge, from both local and regional sources, is a major contributor to the hydrologic budgets of these catchments. An important factor in determining carbon influx to the stream is the area of peatland in the catchment. Peatland porewaters contain DOC concentrations up to 40 mg l(-1) and are a significant potential carbon source. Ground-water discharge and lateral flow through peat are the suspected mechanisms for transport of that carbon to the streams. Carbon and nitrogen isotopes suggested that the sources of DOC in Allequash Creek above Allequash Lake were wetland vegetation and peat and that the sources below Allequash Lake were filamentous algae and wild rice. Catchments with high proportions of peatland, including the Allequash Creek catchment, tended to have elevated DOC loads in outflowing stream water. Respiration and carbon mineralization in lakes within the system tend to produce low DOC and low DOC/DIC in lake outflows, especially at Trout Lake. In Allequash Lake, however, the shallow peat island and vegetation-filled west end were sources of DOC. Despite the vast carbon reservoir in the peatlands, carbon yields were very low in these catchments. Maximum yields were on the order of 2.5 g m(-2) y(-1) DOC and 5.5 g m(-2) y(-1) DIC. The small yields were attributable to low stream flows due to lack of significant overland runoff and very limited stream channel coverage of the total catchment area.

AB Sphagnum riparium (Angstrom) is a rare constituent of modern peatland plant communities and is also very rarely found as a subfossil in peat archives. We present new data on the occurrence of Sphagnum riparium macrofossils in three Northern Hemisphere peatlands from Yellowknife (NW Canada), Abisko (N Sweden), and the Northern Ural Mountains (NW Russia). Sphagnum riparium macrofossils were present in transitional phases between rich fen and oligotrophic bog. Sphagnum riparium was a dominant species in the three sites and was found in combination with Sphagnum angustifolium, Drepanocladus sp., and vascular plants including Andromeda polifolia, Chamedaphne calyculata and Oxycoccus palustris. Testate amoebae indicate that the species occurred in wet to moderately wet conditions (water-table depth inferred from a testate amoeba transfer function model ranged between 25 and 0 cm under the peatland surface). The wet-indicator taxa Archerella flavum and Hyalosphenia papilio dominated the testate amoeba communities in peat horizons containing Sphagnum riparium. The presence of Sphagnum riparium macrofossils in peat profiles in the Northern Hemisphere can be interpreted as an indication of wet minerotrophic conditions, often corresponding to a rise in water-level and establishment of a wet habitat. Sphagnum riparium is a transient species in these peatlands and is replaced by communities dominated by more acidophilic species such as Sphagnum angustifolium, Sphagnum russowii, and Sphagnum fuscum. Our data show that although Sphagnum riparium is a transient peat-forming species, it is widespread in sub-arctic and boreal environments. The subfossil occurrence of Sphagnum riparium in the Northern Hemisphere may indicate that its range has increased during the Late Holocene. The conservation of Sphagnum riparium in peatlands depends on the existence of relatively short-lived transitional communities which potentially can be artificially created. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The relicts of large meandering paleochannels are found throughout the territory of the periglacial zone of the last (Valdai = Weichselian) glaciation on the Russian Plain, on the lower levels of river terraces and on the floodplains. Channel widths of so-called macromeanders can be 15 times larger than the recent meanders on the same rivers. Paleolandscape and paleohydrological reconstructions show that such periglacial river channels were formed under the conditions of high spring water flow, up to right times greater than modern discharges, when the flow coefficient was close to 0.9-1.0 due to the existence of permafrost. Also, summers were dry and streams lacked ground water supply. Permafrost degradation increased soil permeability in the spring and increased ground water flow during summer, causing a decrease of annual flow 12,000-14,000 years BP in the southern periglacial zone, and up to 8500 years BP in the northern periglacial zone. In the taiga zone, an annual flow in the recent river basins is about 80-85% of that found in the periglacial zone in the east, and 30-60% of that in the west. In the east of the broad-leaved forest zone, it is about 40-50% of that of the periglacial zone, and 20-25% in the western part of the broad-leaved forest zone. In the eastern steppe and forest steppe, the modern annual flow is about 40-60% of that of the periglacial zone and about 10% in the western part of steppe and forest steppe zones. As a result, large periglacial channels were abandoned and transformed into floodplain lakes and bogs. The Holocene channels have much smaller channel widths and meander lengths, formed under conditions of lower annual flows and much steadier flow regime. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Ombrotrophic peatlands have provided important archives for understanding Holocene palaeoenvironmental change. However, records are predominantly from raised bogs due to potential issues regarding preservation of proxy indicators, record length and low temporal resolution in other peat types including blanket bogs. By carrying out peat depth and stratigraphy surveys we demonstrate how blanket peatlands can provide archives capable of providing records that are not reliant on single proxies, as has been often the case in the past, and can provide good resolution records. A record containing humification, testate amoebae and plant macrofossils was derived for the last 3000 years with accumulation rates as high as 8 yrs cm(-1) providing favourable temporal resolution, particularly over the last 1500 years. Major changes in proxy indicators reflecting potential changes in water-table depth were often coherent with changes in climate. Human activity also had a major impact on the peatland throughout the record especially in the last 100 years where the influence of wildfire and managed burning, together with an effect of atmospheric pollution, fundamentally changed the state of the peatland.

AB A water budget analysis (precipitation (P), surface runoff (Q), evapotranspiration (ET) and storage variations (Delta S)) was completed over a 3-year span for two Sphagnum bogs, three patterned fens and two shallow lakes all located in the La Grande River watershed in central Quebec. The high variability of P from 2005 to 2007 during summer and fall (July to October) allowed us to produce water budgets over a large spectrum of wetness conditions at seasonal and event timescales. Bogs and fens (not lakes) have the intrinsic ability to keep the water table near the surface most of the time, which affects Q. Fens and lakes showed a similar hydrological behavior when compared to bogs, in spite of differences in Q and Delta S variability due to the typical vegetation structure of fens. This structure also tends to produce sharper rises of Q when compared to lakes that have overall smoother hydrograms. The dominant water budget term for bogs, fens and lakes was Delta S, Q and Er, respectively. Finally, an adaptation of the Penman-Monteith equation was successfully used to estimate potential ET. This revised method is based on peatland vegetation identification that provides a simple weighing factor for stomatal resistance.

AB Increased radiative forcing is an inevitable part of global climate change, yet little is known of its potential effects on the energy fluxes in natural ecosystems. To simulate the conditions of global warming, we exposed peat monoliths (depth, 0.6 m; surface area, 2.1 m(2)) from a bog and fen in northern Minnesota, USA, to three infrared (IR) loading (ambient, +45, and +90 W m(-2)) and three water table (-16, -20, and -29 cm in bog and -1, -10 and -18 cm in fen) treatments, each replicated in three mesocosm plots. Net radiation (Rn) and soil energy fluxes at the top, bottom, and sides of the mesocosms were measured in 1999, 5 years after the treatments had begun. Soil heat flux (G) increased proportionately with IR loading, comprising about 3%-8% of Rn. In the fen, the effect of IR loading on G was modulated by water table depth, whereas in the bog it was not. Energy dissipation from the mesocosms occurred mainly via vertical exchange with air, as well as with deeper soil layers through the bottom of the mesocosms, whereas lateral fluxes were 10-20-fold smaller and independent of IR loading and water table depth. The exchange with deeper soil layers was sensitive to water table depth, in contrast to G, which responded primarily to IR loading. The qualitative responses in the bog and fen were similar, but the fen displayed wider seasonal variation and greater extremes in soil energy fluxes. The differences of G in the bog and fen are attributed to differences in the reflectance in the long waveband as a function of vegetation type, whereas the differences in soil heat storage may also depend on different soil properties and different water table depth at comparable treatments. These data suggest that the ecosystem-dependent controls over soil energy fluxes may provide an important constraint on biotic response to climate change.

AB Peatlands store similar to 20 %-30% of the global soil organic carbon stock and are an important source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for inland waters. Recent improvements for in situ optical monitoring revealed that the DOC concentration in streams draining peatlands is highly variable, showing seasonal variation and short and intense DOC concentration peaks. This study aimed to statistically determine the variables driving stream DOC concentration variations at seasonal and event scales. Two mountainous peatlands (one fen and one bog) were monitored in the French Pyrenees to capture their outlet DOC concentration variability at a high-frequency rate (30 min). Abiotic variables including precipitation, stream temperature and water level, water table depth, and peat water temperature were also monitored at high frequency and used as potential predictors to explain DOC concentration variability. Results show that at both sites DOC concentration time series can be decomposed into a seasonal baseline interrupted by many short and intense peaks of higher concentrations. The DOC concentration baseline is driven, at the seasonal scale, by peat water temperature. At the event scale, DOC concentration increases are mostly driven by a rise in the water table within the peat at both sites. Univariate linear models between DOC concentration and peat water temperature or water table increases show greater efficiency at the fen site. Water recession times were derived from water level time series using master recession curve coefficients. They vary greatly between the two sites but also within one peatland site. They partly explain the differences between DOC dynamics in the studied peatlands, including peat porewater DOC concentrations and the links between stream DOC concentration and water table rise within the peatlands. This highlights that peatland complexes are composed of a mosaic of heterogeneous peat units distinctively producing or transferring DOC to streams.

ID GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE; HYDROLOGY; BALANCE; FLOW
AB This paper describes the application of a transient three-dimensional groundwater model to simulate water flux through a floodplain wetland, Narborough Bog, in Central England. The results of a programme of water-table monitoring are summarised to indicate the extent of water-table fluctuation, and experiments to determine hydraulic flow parameters are detailed. Hydraulic conductivities of deposits are highly variable; observations were in the range 1.16 x 10(-3)-4.63 x 10(-2) cm s(-1) for herbaceous peat, 1.16 10(-4) cm s(-1) for wood peat, and 9.14 x 10(-6)-3.36 x 10(-8) cm s(-1) for silty clay. A three-layer groundwater model of the wetland is developed using MODFLOW from these initial values, and with stratigraphic data obtained by hand augering. The model is calibrated using data for two periods of recharge from precipitation by adjusting specific yield and vertical hydraulic conductivity within prescribed limits. The accuracy of the model is then assessed by comparing daily model predictions of water-table response to potential evapotranspiration at specific monitoring points. Model results demonstrate the importance of variation in hydraulic characteristics with depth in wetlands, thus emphasizing the dependence of water-table response upon water-table position, and preceding moisture conditions. The resulting water-table configuration reflects the balance between horizontal and lateral water flow through the wetland, and its relationship to river stage. The success of the stratigraphic representation is considered and its general applicability evaluated. Finally, the use of the calibrated model for local hydrological management is considered, and the effects on the wetland water budget of varying river stage by specified amounts are examined.

AB The sensitivity of peatland water-table depth reconstructions to past hydroclimate variability was assessed by comparing Pb-210-dated, testate amoeba-based reconstructions of water-table depth with instrumental records of temperature, precipitation, and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Comparisons were made for the past century at five sites in the western Great Lakes region of North America. The primary objectives were (1) to assess the relative influence of temperature and precipitation on proxy records from these systems, (2) compare an integrated index of past moisture variability, PDSI, to records of peatland surface-moisture, and (3) compare the relative climate sensitivity of paleohydrological records from a raised bog and two types of kettle peatland, including those with and without floating peat mats. Results indicated that the raised bog surface-moisture reconstructions were most strongly correlated with PDSI, with precipitation variability more important than temperature variability. Proxy records from two non-floating kettle peatlands were also correlated with PDSI, although the importance of precipitation and temperature varied between the two sites. Records from floating mats were not correlated with instrumental climate records, although patterns suggest that additional research is needed to assess the sensitivity of these systems to high-magnitude or prolonged drought events. Although the relative importance of precipitation and temperature in controlling peatland surface-moisture conditions may vary in space and time, consistent correlations with PDSI indicate that peatland archives are well suited for studies of past drought variability and should be particularly valuable in humid regions at mid-to-high latitudes where moisture-sensitive records are scarce.

AB The Elatia Mires of northern Greece are unique ecosystems of high conservation value. The mires are climatically marginal and may be sensitive to changing hydroclimate, while northern Greece has experienced a significant increase in aridity since the late twentieth century. To investigate the impact of recent climatic change on the hydrology of the mires, the palaeoecological record was investigated from three near-surface monoliths extracted from two sites. Testate amoebae were analysed as sensitive indicators of hydrology. Results were interpreted using transfer function models to provide quantitative reconstructions of changing water table depth and pH. AMS radiocarbon dates and Pb-210 suggest the peats were deposited within the last c. 50 years, but do not allow a secure chronology to be established. Results from all three profiles show a distinct shift towards a more xerophilic community particularly noted by increases in Euglypha species. Transfer function results infer a distinct lowering of water tables in this period. A hydrological response to recent climate change is a tenable hypothesis to explain this change; however other possible explanations include selective test decay, vertical zonation of living amoebae, ombrotrophication and local hydrological change. It is suggested that a peatland response to climatic change is the most probable hypothesis, showing the sensitivity of marginal peatlands to recent climatic change.

AB This article reviews the existing conceptual and simulation models for peatlands and develops a model framework for simulating peatland dynamics in boreal regions. Clymo's peat bog growth model has been used as the conceptual foundation in published simulation models, but in these models the structural and functional layers of litter, acrotelm and catotelm are not dynamically integrated. Organic-matter decomposition processes in these layers operate at different rates over various time scales. The processes in more active litter and acrotelm layers largely pre-determine the net peat accumulation in the catotelm. On the basis of evaluating litter and peat-core data, we propose a model design that connects different layers through changing water-table depth, driven by effective moisture. The model framework includes single and double negative exponential decay functions that together produce net peat accumulation or degradation and hence carbon balance. The model is designed to be generic in structure, but can be validated using estimated parameters and observed peat accumulation data for continental western Canada. The objectives of this model exercise are (1) to understand the interactions of different biological and environmental factors in boreal peatlands, and (2) to realistically simulate peat accumulation and decay over the last several millennia using proxy paleoclimate data as drivers and peat profiles for validation.

AB Coastal wetlands like the nature reserve "Hutelmoor und Heiligensee" northeast of Rostock are characteristic elements of the landscapes along the southern Baltic Sea coastline. Under natural conditions, their hydrological peculiarities include exchange processes between the fens and the Baltic Sea. Due to human interventions, e.g. the construction of dunes and dikes, drainage systems and lately also renaturation measures, their hydrological regime has been repeatedly changed over the centuries.The nature reserve (German: Naturschutzgebiet, NSG)"Hijtelmoor und Heiligensee", formerly used for pasture, has recently been restored, which allows the investigation of past changes and the evaluation of possible and future developments. The present contribution is the first part of a double publication which aims at identifying the relevant hydrological processes that affect the water balance of the presented wetland area. The investigations are based on a monitoring network measuring groundwater levels and electric conductivity within the fen since 2009, as well as on measurements of the flow and of meteorological variables. The topic of this first publication part is the hydrological characterization of the area under study and the identification of its particular hydrological basic patterns. This is done on the basis of a principal water budget, i.e. balancing of the different water flows across the system's borders, such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, inflows from the neighbouring parts of the catchment area, subterranean exchange processes with the Baltic Sea and the area's surface discharge. Furthermore, the episodic input of salty water, in the rare cases of heavy storm tides causing dune overspilling or breaching, provides salt as a natural tracer. This tracer allows clearer distinction of the specific processes in this particular lowland (vertical fluxes due to precipitation, evaporation and rising groundwater levels, lateral transport processes, exchange with trenches).This concerns the temporal dynamics (both seasonality and trends) as well as the spatial patterns of salt concentration reflecting the water flows within the peat layers, which will be discussed in part II (SELLE et al. 2016).

AB The Vasi peatland complex is situated in the northeast of South Africa. It is an unprotected area surrounded by pine (Pinus sp.) and blue gum (Eucalyptus sp.) plantations. Little is known about the conditioning factors for the area's development and causes of degradation. In order to understand the ecohydrological system of this complex, water tables and ionic composition of surface water and groundwater, as well as natural isotopes of oxygen, hydrogen and carbon, were measured. Macrofossils and radiocarbon dating of the peat layer were used to describe the historical environmental conditions. We found that peat accumulation started during the Early Holocene and was initiated by terrestrialisation of inter-dune lakes. Our results also show that the Vasi peatland complex is primarily dependent on a perched water table due to the presence of iron-rich deposits close to the surface (i.e. KwaMbonambi Formation). The Vasi peatland basins appear to be hydrologically connected and some basins show indications of cascading through-flow systems, which means that the water flows from a higher basin to a lower one through the permeable parts of the sand dunes and peat layers. The stratigraphy indicates continuous peat accumulation, and thus that the water table was perennially high for thousands of years, despite evidence of the occasional natural occurrence of fires. We conclude that the most likely cause of the observed signs of degradation is land use change, i.e. the recent establishment of plantations, which affect the groundwater system.

AB There is a limited understanding of the distribution and transport of solutes in the coastal forest-peatland systems of northern British Columbia, Canada. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the sources, concentration and flux of major ions and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soil-groundwater system of a forest-peatland complex in the coastal western hemlock (CWH) forest zone. DOC dominated the groundwater flux, with most of it exported during high flow conditions. Inorganic ion concentration increased and DOC decreased with ground surface slope and community type from open peatland to bog woodland, bog forest, swamp forest and upland forest. Base cations, HCO3- and DOC in the peatland forest communities differed significantly (P < 0.05) from concentrations in the upland forest. The greatest concentrations of ions derived from mineral weathering were found in the upland forest where the absence of peat, deep mineral soil (85-465 cm) and steep surface slope (26%) combined to increase dissolution by recharging groundwater. NO3-, SO42- and PO43- were at or below detection limits. Concentrations of DOC, metals and HCO3- decreased from summer to spring with dilution by rainfall and decreasing decomposition. In addition to providing novel data in a data-sparse region, this study provides an analysis of the processes controlling runoff production and the transport and transformation of biogeochemical elements impacting stream water quality.

AB [1] Dynamics of biogenic bubbles in peat soils were studied at a field site in southern Quebec, Canada. The maximum gas content measured in this study varied spatially with a maximum seasonal increase in volumetric gas content of 0.15. The size of changes in total gas content of a 1 m deep profile was comparable to the seasonal water storage change. Changes in bubble volume in the saturated zone alter the water table level and, consequently, the water content in the unsaturated zone and the apparent water budget. In highly compressible soils ( and floating root mats), buoyancy forces from bubbles also cause relations between the surface and the water table to change. These effects cannot be omitted in modeling the hydrology of peatlands. Our results indicate a great spatial variability of trapped bubbles. Using pressure transducers sealed to the surface, we found pressure deviations indicating small areas closed off by bubbles clogging the pores. The hydrological influence of these areas may be considerable as they may restrict or deflect water flows. Open pipe piezometers did not show these pressure deviations, possibly because the closed zones were too small to influence the head in pipes or because of less amount of gas close to the pipe screen.

AB In Albertas Western Boreal Plain, oil sands mining strips overburden materials including vegetation and soils, leaving unnatural, undulating landforms where wetlands previously covered > 50% of the landscape. Due to their complexity, the re-establishment of peatland ecosystems had not been tested prior to two fen reclamation projects on oil sands leases north of Fort McMurray. One of which, the Nikanotee Fen, was constructed using peat stripped as part of the mining process and placed in an engineered watershed designed to provide the requisite groundwater supply to support fen hydrological functions and vegetation. The unknown effects of disturbed, placed peat and vegetation treatments on the constructed fens soil water dynamics were studied from 2013 to 2015, the first three growing seasons post-construction. Water table, soil moisture (theta), pore water pressure (Psi), evapotranspiration (ET) and surface elevation were monitored in thirty-one study plots designed to test revegetation strategies, including control (bare peat), moss, seedling, mulched moss and mulched seedling treatments. Fifty-four peat samples were tested for a suite of hydrophysical parameters, including saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and soil-water retention. Plot water table positions fluctuated 36 cm below ground surface (bgs) despite a relatively small range in surface elevation between plots (similar to 24 cm), where plots located at higher elevations had consistently lower and more variable water tables. Although average plot water tables all ranged within 5-7 cm bgs, theta, Psi and ET differed significantly between certain plot types (p < 0.05). The observed hydrology is partially affected by the heterogeneous peat properties across the fen, created by the salvage and placement methods of the peat, which significantly differed with location (p < 0.05). The variability in the hydrophysical properties and surface elevations, thus water table position, appear to mask the effects of vegetation and treatment type on plot hydrology, at least at this early stage of development. While significant increases in plot Psi and theta were observed from 2013 to 2015, further studies are required to track the effects of greater vegetation establishment and peat formation and elucidate the effects of different vegetation treatments.

DE base-rich fens; ecohydrology; groundwater system analysis
ID PRECIPITATION
AB Slitere National Park in Latvia is home to rich fens with many endangered and threatened plant species. This study aims to address how the hydrological systems affect vegetation biodiversity (cf. Wolejko et al. 2019) in the mire systems of the National Park: the base-rich inter-dune mires and extremely base-rich calcareous fens. Groundwater samples from these areas were collected for measurements of ion composition and natural isotopes of C, H and O. Also, we simulated groundwater flow paths from the highest local topographical point (a nearby sandy plateau) to the sea, and calculated the residence times of these groundwater flows. The results show that the inter-dune mires are supplied by a mixture of local and regional groundwater systems. The groundwater supply at one of the inter-dune mires was dominated by local groundwater flow from adjacent dunes, but we also detected a small input of calcareous water. This dominance of local groundwater may have resulted from the presence of drainage ditches and a small stream that drains into the Baltic Sea. In contrast, the extremely base-rich fens were found to be solely dependent on regional groundwater which is likely to discharge at the plateau foothills due to the presence of fault structures. Thus, the mires in Slitere National Park are not as undisturbed as was previously believed. Drainage may have affected the original hydrological flow paths. Further research on the extent of these changes is recommended to preserve the endangered species and high biodiversity of these fens. Also, in order to trace the origin of groundwater flows, further investigation into the larger landscape beyond the plateau might be required.

AB Assemblages of zoo-indicators were studied in the peat deposits of a floodplain terrace eutrophic peatland located on the bank of Bakchar River, within the southern taiga zone of western Siberia. The peat deposits were formed by minerotrophic peat dated 8500 cal yr BP. A detailed analysis of fossil animal remains (testate amoebae, oribatid mites and molluscs) was carried out in three peat layers formed under contrasting environmental conditions. These peat layers used for the analysis of zoo-indicators were selected, based on data concerning plant macrofossils of the peat and the dynamics of hydrological indices such as: the peat humification index and the water table depth (WTD) calculated using rhizopod analysis. A thorough study of zoo-indicator paleo-assemblages allowed us to reconstruct increased water levels in the eutrophic peatland during the periods 5900-5400 and 4000-3900 cal yr BP; moreover, in the first case the water regime was flowing, to change for stagnant in the second. A period of a decreased water level in the peatland was also revealed, between 4900-4800 cal yr BP.

AB The Florida Everglades is a patterned peatland formed from sawgrass and other aquatic plant material that has accumulated over millennia. This peatland was initially drained in the late 1800s for agricultural and urban development and has been highly modified by the construction of canals and levees. Restoration plans include providing additional surface water flow which should help to prevent further peat loss by oxidation and encourage the accretion of peat that has been lost through drainage and peat fires. But how much peat has been lost? We know that about 50 % of the original surface area is gone; but what about the driver of ecological processes, the soil? Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, we compared predrainage and current peat volumes using historical and recent datasets, spatially-referenced soil bulk density values and carbon content to determine peat mass and carbon mass for each Everglades region. Given the uncertainties in the datasets, this analysis should be viewed as providing rough order-of-magnitude values. Our calculations indicate that the current Everglades contains less than 24 % of the original peat volume, 17 % of its mass and 19 % of its carbon.

ID VEGETATION; NETHERLANDS; GRADIENTS; SYSTEM
AB Dynamics in hydrology and water chemistry in the Biebrza mires (Poland) were examined by means of a sampling survey that was repeated four times between 1987 and 1992. The dynamics in the Vertical stratigraphy of water types in the peat profile are considerable from close to the mire surface to a depth of 50 cm. Water composition in the root zone correlated best with vegetation types during extremely dry or wet conditions. In the root zone of groundwater-fed rich fens with Caricetum limoso-diandrae and Calamagrostietum strictae vegetation, specific groundwater types evolve from the interaction of discharging groundwater from below the root zone and the temporal influence of precipitation and evapotranspiration. The Caricetum limoso-diandrae is fed by the continuous discharge of nutrient-poor, relatively mineral-rich water. The site conditions in the Calamagrostietum strictae are determined by occasional flooding and the presence of discharging mineral-poor groundwater in the lower part of the root zone. In the Caricetum limoso-diandrae and the Calamagrostietum strictae the maximum variations in water level were 56 and 86 cm, respectively. The composition of shallow groundwater of the Betuletum humilis/Caricetum rostrato-diandrae fen is diluted most compared to other vegetation types by rainwater in wet periods. In periods of prolonged drought it has a water type that is affected by evapotranspiration and peat mineralisation. The water level varies by only 33 cm. In the Magnocaricion and Glycerietum maximae in the floodplain the water composition is determined by spring flooding of the river and the natural draw-down that occurs in the following summer. Here, maximum variations in water level were 108 and 117 cm, respectively.

AB The large belowground carbon stocks in northern peatland ecosystems are potentially susceptible to release because of the expected differential responses of photosynthesis and respiration to climate change. This study compared net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) measured using the eddy covariance technique at two peatland sites in northern Alberta, Canada, over three growing seasons (May-October). We observed distinct differences between the poor fen (Sphagnum moss dominated) and extreme-rich fen (Carex sedge dominated) sites for their responses of NEE to interannual variation in temperature and water table depth. The rates of growing season cumulative NEE at the poor fen were very similar among the three study years with an average (+/- standard deviation) of -110.1 +/- 0.5 g C m (2) period (1). By contrast, the growing season cumulative NEE at the extreme-rich fen varied substantially among years (-34.5, -153.5, and -41.8 g C m(-2) period(-1) in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively), and net uptake of CO2 was lower (on average) than at the poor fen. Consistent with the eddy covariance measurements, analysis of Pb-210-dated peat cores also showed higher recent net rates of carbon accumulation in the poor fen than in the rich fen. Warm spring temperatures and sufficient water availability during the growing season resulted in the highest-magnitude ecosystem photosynthesis and NEE at the extreme-rich fen in 2005. Cool spring temperatures limited photosynthesis at the extreme-rich fen in 2004, while reduced water availability (lower water table) in 2006 constrained photosynthetic capacity relative to 2005, despite the warmer spring and summer temperatures in 2006. The combination of contrasting plant functional types and different peat water table features at our two study sites meant that the poor fen showed a reduced response of ecosystem CO2 exchange to environmental variation compared to the extreme-rich fen.

AB Mapping of two low-centred ice-wedge polygons in the Yakutian tundra (NE Siberia) along a regular Grid with 1-m spacing revealed large spatial variability in thaw depths and strong, correlation with relief, water and vegetation. Average thaw depths in polygon ridges (23 cm and 31 cm) were smaller than in depressions (33 cm and 40 cm, respectively). The greatest thaw depths, however, were also found in the ridges and probably result from thermal erosion by water flow. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Fluxes of methane were measured by a static chamber technique at hummock, hollow, and lawn microtopographic locations in 12 peatland sites near Cochrane, northern Ontario, from May to October 1991. Average fluxes (mg . m-2 . d-1) were 2.3 (SD = 1.9) at hummocks, 44.4 (SD = 49.0) at hollows, and 15.6 (SD = 12.9) at lawns. Methane flux was negatively correlated with average water table position based on the 36 locations (r2 = 0.649, p < 0.001), with hummocks having a smaller flux than hollows or lawns, where the water table depth was < 25 cm. Peat samples from a bog hummock and hollow failed to produce methane during anaerobic incubations in the laboratory; samples from a poor fen hollow produced < 1.4 mug . g-1 . d-1. The production decreased with depth but was greater than the rates observed during the incubation of samples from an adjacent hummock. Rates of methane consumption during aerobic incubations ranged from 1 to 55 mug . g-1 . d-1 and were greatest in the surface layers and decreased with depth. Differences in methane emissions between hummocks and hollows appear to be controlled primarily by greater methane production rates in hollows compared with hummocks. Of secondary importance are the capacity of the peat profiles to consume methane during its transport to the peat surface and warmer temperatures at the water table beneath hollows compared with hummocks.

AB Our aim in this study was to evaluate whether coverage change in the vegetation of a forestry buffer wetland can be used to reveal a possible increase in nutrients. To achieve this, we followed changes in vegetation on two peatland buffers, and biomass with nitrogen content in one of them. Nutrient concentrations were periodically lower in the water inflow than in the outflow. Flooding caused a species change in favor of flood-tolerant grasses and Sphagna, but this species composition did not indicate a higher trophic level. Nitrogen content in the reference site's original surface peat layer, which was rich in woody remains, was higher than that of the newly formed, more acidic Sphagnum peat of the spruce swamp buffer. Changes in biomass did not indicate an increased nutrient-binding capacity of the spruce swamp buffer vegetation. On the other hand, the changes in species cover outlined the area of effective water flow paths within the buffer and suggested that severe eutrophication of peatland forestry buffers does not seem likely.

AB Spatiotemporal changes in the hydrogeology of the Hula altered wetland may influence the water quality of Lake Kinneret, which provides up to 30% of the potable water for the state of Israel. The main objectives of this work were to study the ground-water-flow characteristics in this wettand and assess the potential impact on downstream water quality. We constructed variograms of hydraulic heads, computed decision-tree models of major ions, and determined the hydraulic conductivity (K) and delta H-2/delta O-18 ratios, to ascertain the spatial and vertical distribution of hydrogeologicat parameters. We also performed large-scale field experiments (>= 1 km(2)) to assess the connectivity between the waterways and the wetland's aquifer. The aquifer is fragmented by three parent materials: deep peat, shallow peat/marl complex and mart. The decision-tree-based model, the isotopic ratios and K determinations suggest that the deep peat subaquifer is composed of one homogeneous layer characterized by tow K (0.001 m d(-1)). The two other subaquifers consist of three hydrostratigraphic layers: (i) the vadose zone, (ii) a layer with well-developed macropores at a depth of 1.5-4 m and (iii) an aquitard layer at a depth of 4-15 m. The temporal head fluctuations, the high K values of the second layer (>170 m d(-1)), and the large volume of water flowing into and out of the two subaquifers during large-scale field experiments all attest to excellent connectivity with the waterways. These results support the concept of critical source area which claims that most of the P toss in a catchment derives, from small areas in which specific P release and transport mechanisms coincide with high connectivity. We conclude that the high connectivity of this Mediterranean altered wettand to waterways, coupled with the high P release that has occurred in recent years following soil flooding, provides the loading mechanism that partially explains the observed P increase in the Jordan River.

AB The surface pattern of vegetation influences the composition and humification of peat laid down during the development of a bog, producing a subsurface hydrological structure that is expected to affect both the rate and pattern of water flow. Subsurface peat structures are routinely derived from the inspection of peat cores. However, logistical limits on the number of cores that can be collected means that the horizontal extent of these structures must be inferred. We consider whether subsurface patterns in peat physical properties can be mapped in detail over large areas with ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and complex conductivity by comparing geophysical measurements with peat core data along a 36 m transect through different microhabitats at Caribou Bog, Maine. The geophysical methods show promise. Peat horizons produced radar reflections because of changes in the volumetric moisture content. Although these reflections could not be directly correlated with the peat core data, they were related to the depth-averaged peat properties which varied markedly between the microhabitats. Well-decomposed peat below a hollow was characterized by a discontinuous sequence of chaotic wavy reflections, while distinct layering of the peat below an area of hummocks coincided with a pattern of parallel planar reflections. The complex conductivity survey showed spatial variation in the real and imaginary conductivities which resulted from changes in the pore water conductivity; peat structures may also have influenced the spatial pattern in the complex conductivity. The GPR and complex conductivity surveys enabled the developmental history of the different microhabitats along the studied transect to be inferred.

AB Vegetation analyses (phytosociological releves) of 20 peat bogs arranged along an altitudinal gradient in the southern part of the Czech Republic, Central Europe, revealed relationships between vegetation and environmental gradients. Six of the peat bogs were investigated in detail. The bogs were dominated by Pinus rotundata, a species endemic to Central Europe, and its hybridogenous populations with R mugo (the hybrid is called P. xpseudopumilio), with increasing proportions of the latter at higher altitudes. Data were processed using indirect (DCA) and direct (CCA) gradient analyses. Environmental variables (depth of the water table, mean and minimum temperatures, precipitation, pH, conductivity, NH(4) and PO(4) concentrations, total P, but not total N nor NO(3) concentration), as well as biotic characteristics of the sites, such as species composition, and growth form of the dominant pines, were closely correlated with altitude. Woody species, herbs and bryophytes responded to the altitude similarly. Results also indicated the unique characteristics of each bog.

AB Peatland-based treatment wetlands that purify incoming water by means of natural physical, chemical and biological processes belonging to the peatland ecosystem are widely used at Finnish peat extraction sites. They can comprise either undrained or drained overland flow areas (OFAs or DOFAs), with the OFAs representing the best available technology (BAT) for peat extraction. We analyse here the long-term treatment performance of these OFAs and DOFAs and factors affecting this performance. Data on 14 OFAs and DOFAs in different parts of Finland were taken from the extensive long-term environmental pollution control databases. Nearly half of these wetlands had been monitored for at least 4 years and seven for 8-23 years. The results indicated that peatland-based treatment wetlands purify drainage water as efficiently as other natural treatment wetlands on soils in general, the common challenge being phosphorus retention. Iron was also efficiently retained. The average reductions were highest in OFAs with good hydraulic function, and these also showed long-term water protection performance. An important factor affecting purification efficiency was the hydraulic loading rate. Important system design elements in this regard were the size of the wetland in relation to its catchment area, its gradient, the length of the water flow route within the wetland, and the efficient flow area of the wetland. The results regarding the latter two design elements strongly indicate that not all the areas potentially suitable in DOFAs for water purification are yet being used efficiently.

AB A vegetation survey was carried out in a relatively intact Atlantic blanket bog in Southwest Ireland to study the vegetation patterns in relation to environmental variation, and to quantify the effect of artificial and natural borders on compositional variation. The data were analysed using canonical correspondence analysis. In terms of both vegetation and water chemistry, the study site can be categorized as typical of Atlantic blanket bogs in the maritime regions of North-western Europe. The distribution of plant species was explained mainly by depth of the water table. The distribution of bryophytes was secondarily explained by the pH of the bog water, while the distribution of vascular plants was secondarily explained by concentrations of ammonia. The vegetation distribution exhibited little variation between the central sector of the peatland and its disturbed edges (hill-grazing and restoration areas), but a substantial variation was observed between the area along a natural edge (stream) and the areas close to the other peatland borders or centre. Similarly, the internal variation within each sector (centre, hill-grazing edge and restoration area edge) was small, but substantial vegetation variation was observed within the area located along the stream. The area along the stream was associated with relatively deep water table, shallow peat depth, high water colour, pH and NH(4) (+) concentrations, and low Cl(-) concentrations in the bog water. Our results suggest the existence of strong centre-natural margin gradients, as in raised bogs, and indicate that human or animal disturbance do not give rise to the marked transition zones that often characterize natural margins of mire systems. This indicates that even small areas and remnants of Atlantic blanket bogs are worthy of conservation and that their conservation value would benefit from the inclusion of sectors close to the natural peatland borders, which would increase the plant biodiversity of the conserved area.

AB Interactions between headwater aquifers and peatlands have received limited scientific attention. Hydrological stresses, including those related to climate change, may adversely impact these interactions. In this study, the dynamics of a southern Quebec headwater system where a peatland is present is simulated under current conditions and with climate change. The model is calibrated in steady state on field-measured data and provides satisfactory results for transient-state conditions. Under current conditions, simulations confirm that the peatland is fed by the fractured bedrock aquifer year-round and provides continuous baseflow to its outlets. Climate change is simulated through its impact on groundwater recharge. Predicted precipitation and temperature data from a suite of regional climate model scenarios provide a net precipitation variation range from +10% to -30% for the 2041-2070 horizon. Calibrated recharge is modified within this range to perform a sensitivity analysis of the headwater model to recharge variations (+10%, -15% and -30%). Total contribution from the aquifer to rivers and streams varies from +14% to -44% of the baseline for +10% to -30% recharge changes from spring 2010 data, for example. With higher recharge, the peatland receives more groundwater, which could significantly change its vegetation pattern and eventually ecosystem functions. For a -30% recharge, the peatland becomes perched above the aquifer during the summer, fall and winter. Recharge reductions also induce sharp declines in groundwater levels and drying streams.

ID WOODLAND MANAGEMENT; BRANCH AGE; DEPOSITION; DIAMETER; WATER
AB Excavations at the findspot of the Deskford carnyx, a major piece of Iron Age decorated metalwork found in a bog in the early nineteenth century, revealed a special location with a long history. Early Neolithic activity on the adjacent ridge consisted of massive postholes and pits, suggesting a ceremonial site. An Early Bronze Age cremation became the focus for a feasting event in the Middle Bronze Age. Around this time, peat began to form in the valley, with vessels of pot and wood smashed and deposited there; these activities on ridge and bog may be connected. Activity in the bog intensified in the later Iron Age, when offerings included quartz pebbles, the dismantled carnyx head, and two unusual animal bone deposits. The ridge was cut off at this period by a complex enclosure system. This Iron Age activity is interpreted as communal rituals at a time of increasing social tension. The site's significance in this period may stem from its unusual landscape character, with flowing water to one side and a bog to the other. The area saw occasional activity in the Early Medieval period, but its significance had waned.

AB Large-scale wetland restoration often focuses on repairing the hydrologic connections degraded by anthropogenic modifications. Of these hydrologic connections, groundwater discharge is an important target, as these surface water ecosystem control points are important for thermal stability, among other ecosystem services. However, evaluating the effectiveness of the restoration activities on establishing groundwater discharge connection is often difficult over large areas and inaccessible terrain. Unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS) are now routinely used for collecting aerial imagery and creating digital surface models (DSM). Lightweight thermal infrared (TIR) sensors provide another payload option for generation of sub-meter-resolution aerial TIR orthophotos. This technology allows for the rapid and safe survey of groundwater discharge areas. Aerial TIR water-surface data were collected in March 2019 at Tidmarsh Farms, a former commercial cranberry peatland located in coastal Massachusetts, USA (41 degrees 54 ' 17 '' N 70 degrees 34 ' 17 '' W), where stream and wetland restoration actions were completed in 2016. Here, we present a 0.4 km(2) georeferenced, temperature-calibrated TIR orthophoto of the area. The image represents a mosaic of nearly 900 TIR images captured by UAS in a single morning with a total flight time of 36 min and is supported by a DSM derived from UAS-visible imagery. The survey was conducted in winter to maximize temperature contrast between relatively warm groundwater and colder ambient surface environment; lower-density groundwater rises above cool surface waters and thus can be imaged by a UAS. The resulting TIR orthomosaic shows fine detail of seepage distribution and downstream influence along the several restored channel forms, which was an objective of the ecological restoration design. The restored stream channel has increased connectivity to peatland groundwater discharge, reducing the ecosystem thermal stressors. Such aerial techniques can be used to guide ecological restoration design and assess post-restoration outcomes, especially in settings where ecosystem structure and function is governed by groundwater and surface water interaction.

We examined testate amoeba communities and species-environment relationships at 40 locations within a pocosin of North Carolina. Primary objectives were to provide baseline data on the ecology of testate amoebae in pocosins, compare communities with those of northern peatlands, and assess the potential of using testate amoebae as environmental indicators in these systems. Results indicated that pH, substrate-moisture content, and conductivity were important controls on community composition. Communities that were relatively similar and dissimilar to those of northern peatlands were encountered, and the ecology of species with respect to water-table depth was similar in both peatland types. Cross validation of transfer functions for pH and water-table depth suggests that Pocosin testate amoebae can be used as indicators for these variables. However, water-table depth was poorly inferred from communities at several dry sites characterized by high bulk density. These sites may experience large seasonal or interannual variability in moisture conditions because of differences in peat structure, suggesting that research is needed on the influence of short-term variability in shaping community structure.

AB Peatlands form an important part of the Canadian landscape and of many Canadian drainage basins. While there is a considerable body of literature and existing research on peatlands, this paper presents a discussion of areas that should be considered in the future to improve hydrological predictions for drainage basins that contain a significant proportion of peatlands. The critical hydrological issues concern evapotranspiration from peatlands and the water storage and water transmission properties of peatlands as influenced by the structure and composition of peat. The transient surface and subsurface exchange of peatland water with adjacent peatlands and with the surrounding uplands is also important but difficult to characterize. A related area of research is determining how organic matter decomposes and accumulates and changes through time creating the shallow aquifer-aquitard system that is a peatland. The resulting structural differences lead to hydrological, chemical, and ecological differences that reflect the diversity and complexity of peatlands across Canada. This synthesis was informed by the contents of the present volume and the opinions of a cross-section of our colleagues.

AB Thanks to increasing urban development, it has become important for municipalities to understand how ecological processes function. In particular, urban wetlands are vital habitats for the people and the animals living amongst them. This is because wetlands provide great services, including water filtration, flood and drought mitigation, and recreational spaces. As such, several recent urban development plans are currently needed to monitor these invaluable ecosystems using timeand cost-efficient approaches. Accordingly, this study is designed to provide an initial response to the need of wetland mapping in the City of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada. Specifically, we produce the first high-resolution wetland map of the City of St. John's using advanced machine learning algorithms, very high-resolution satellite imagery, and airborne LiDAR. An object-based random forest algorithm is applied to features extracted from WorldView-4, GeoEye-1, and LiDAR data to characterize five wetland classes, namely bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and open water, within an urban area. An overall accuracy of 91.12% is obtained for discriminating different wetland types and wetland surface water flow connectivity is also produced using LiDAR data. The resulting wetland classification map and the water surface flow map can help elucidate a greater understanding of the way in which wetlands are connected to the city's landscape and ultimately aid to improve wetland-related conservation and management decisions within the City of St. John's.

AB The amount of water in peat soil is one factor affecting its bearing capacity, which is a crucial aspect in planning peatland timber harvesting operations. We studied the influence of weather variables on the variation of drained peatland growing season water conditions, here the ground water table depth (WTD). WTD was manually monitored four times in 2014 and three times in 2015 in 10-30 sample plots located in four drained peatland forests in south-western Finland. For each peatland, precipitation and evapotranspiration were calculated from the records of the nearest Finnish Meteorological Institute field stations covering periods from one day to four weeks preceding the WTD monitoring date. A mixed linear model was constructed to investigate the impact of the weather parameters on WTD. Precipitation of the previous four-week period was the most important explanatory variable. The four-week evapotranspiration amount was interacting with the Julian day showing a greater effect in late summer. Other variables influencing WTD were stand volume within the three-metre radius sample plot and distance from nearest ditch. Our results show the potential of weather parameters, specifically that of the previous four-week precipitation and evapotranspiration, for predicting drained peatland water table depth variation and subsequently, the possibility to develop a more general empirical model to assist planning of harvesting operations on drained peatlands.

AB Testate amoebae are abundant and diverse in Sphagnum peat bogs and have been used extensively as indicators of past water table depths. Although these unicellular protists are widely dispersed with globally similar hydrological preferences, regional variations in communities demand region-specific transfer functions. Here we present the first transfer function for southern Patagonian bogs, based on 154 surface samples obtained from transects in five bogs sampled in 2012 and 2013. Significant variance was explained by pH, electrical conductivity and, in particular, water table depth. Transfer functions for water table were constructed using weighted averaging and evaluated by cross-validation and independent test sets. The optimal transfer function has predictive ability, but relatively high prediction errors given the wide range in sampled water tables. The use of independent test sets, as well as cross-validation, allows a more rigorous assessment of model performance than most previous studies. For a subset of locations we compare surface and subsurface samples to demonstrate significant differences in community composition, possibly due to vertical zonation. Our results provide the first quantification of hydrological optima and tolerances for several rare species, which may include Southern Hemisphere endemics and pave the way for palaeohydrological reconstructions in southern Patagonian bogs.

AB We identify and assess the relative importance of the principal factors influencing the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved forms of nitrogen (N) from a small upland headwater dominated by podzolic soils during a sequence of autumn runoff events. We achieve this by subjecting high-resolution hydrometeorological and hydrochemical data to an R-mode principal component factor analysis and a stepwise multivariate regression analysis. We find that the release of DOC and N is influenced by four principal factors, namely event magnitude, soil water flow through the Bs horizon, the length of time since the soil profile was last flushed, and rewetting of the H horizon. The release of DOC and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is most strongly influenced by the combination of event magnitude and soil water flow through the Bs horizon, and to a lesser extent by the length of time since the soil profile was last flushed. Rewetting of the H horizon also influences the release of DOC, but this is not the case for DON. The release of nitrate (NO(3)-N) is most strongly influenced by the combination of the length of time since the soil profile was last flushed and rewetting of the H horizon, and to a lesser extent by event magnitude. Soil water flow through the Bs horizon does not influence the release of NO(3)-N. We argue that the mechanisms by which the above factors influence the release of DOC and N are probably strongly associated with moisture-dependent biological activity, which governs the turnover of organic matter in the soil and limits the availability of NO(3)-N in the soil for leaching. We conclude that the release of DOC and N from upland headwaters dominated by podzolic soils is largely controlled by the variable interaction of hydrometeorological factors and moisture-dependent biological processes, and that a shift in climate towards drier summers and wetter winters may result in the release of DOC and N becoming increasingly variable and more episodic in the future.

AB Humid lands, such as riparian zones, peatlands, and unsubmerged wetlands, are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, providing a bountiful habitat for a large number of plant and animal species. In such ecosystems, the water table dynamics play a key role in major ecohydrological processes. The aim of the present study is to test with field data a recent analytical model for the estimation of the long-term probability distribution of the belowground water table position in groundwater-dependent environments. This model accounts for stochastic rainfall and processes such as infiltration, root water uptake, water flow from/to an external water body, and capillary fluxes. The water table model is tested using field data of groundwater levels recorded in three different sites within the Everglades (Florida, USA). A sensitivity analysis of the model to the soil and vegetation parameters is also carried out. After performing a procedure to determinate appropriate model parameters for the three sites, the steady state probability distribution functions of water table levels predicted by the model are compared to the empirical ones at both the annual and the seasonal time scale. The model is shown capable to reproduce many features of the observed distributions although there exist model predictions which still show some discrepancies with respect to the empirical observations. The potential causes for these discrepancies are also investigated and discussed.

AB In the Boreal Plain of Canada, the margins of peatland ecosystems that regulate solute and nutrient fluxes between peatlands and adjacent mineral uplands are prone to deep peat burning. Whether post-fire carbon accumulation is able to offset large carbon losses associated with the deep burning at peatland margins is unknown. For this reason, we examined how post-fire hydrological conditions (i.e. water table depth and periodicity, soil tension, and surface moisture content) and depth of burn were associated with moss recolonization at the peatland margins of three sites. We then interpreted these findings using a hydrogeological systems approach, given the importance of groundwater in determining conditions in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum in peatlands. Peatland margins dominated by local groundwater flow from adjacent peatland middles were characterized by dynamic hydrological conditions that, when coupled with lowered peatland margin surface elevations due to deep burning, produced two common hydrological states: 1) flooding during wet periods and 2) rapid water table declines during dry periods. These dynamic hydrological states were unfavorable to peatland moss recolonization and bryophytes typical of post-fire recovery in mineral uplands became established. In contrast, at a peatland margin where post-fire hydrological conditions were moderated by larger-scale groundwater flow, flooding and rapid water table declines were infrequent and, subsequently, greater peatland-dwelling moss recolonization was observed. We argue that peatland margins poorly connected to larger-scale groundwater flow are not only prone to deep burning but also lags in post-fire moss recovery. Consequently, an associated reduction in post-fire peat accumulation may occur and negatively affect the net carbon sink status and ecohydrological and biogeochemical function of these peatlands.

AB Peatlands represent important archives of Holocene paleoclimatic information. However, autogenic processes may disconnect peatland hydrological behavior from climate and overwrite climatic signals in peat records. We use a simulation model of peatland development driven by a range of Holocene climate reconstructions to investigate climate signal preservation in peat records. Simulated water-table depths and peat decomposition profiles exhibit homeostatic recovery from prescribed changes in rainfall, whereas changes in temperature cause lasting alterations to peatland structure and function. Autogenic ecohydrological feedbacks provide both high- and low-pass filters for climatic information, particularly rainfall. Large-magnitude climatic changes of an intermediate temporal scale (i.e., multidecadal to centennial) are most readily preserved in our simulated peat records. Simulated decomposition signals are offset from the climatic changes that generate them due to a phenomenon known as secondary decomposition. Our study provides the mechanistic foundations for a framework to separate climatic and autogenic signals in peat records.

AB Although widely used in wetland hydrological studies, hydraulic conductivity (K) estimates from piezometer slug tests are often of questionable validity. Frequently, this is because insufficient attention is paid to the details of the test procedure. Further, in a potentially heterogeneous and anisotropic medium such as peat, the use of slug tests is prone to error. In this paper we address some of the methodological issues surrounding piezometer slug tests in peat. We compare slug test data with laboratory determinations of vertical and horizontal K obtained using a new method. Piezometers were installed at three depths in a floodplain fen peat in Norfolk, UK. Slug tests were initiated by both slug insertion and slug withdrawal, and repeat tests were conducted to examine the robustness of our K estimates. Most of the tests displayed departures from the log-linear model of Hvorslev, the form of departure being consistent with compressible soil behaviour. The results suggest that insertion tests gave similar results to those initiated by withdrawal. Repeat testing showed that withdrawal data, in particular, gave highly reproducible normalized responses that were independent of the initial head. Values for K estimated using the slug tests were in the range 1 x 10(-4) to 1.6 x 10(-3) cm s(-1), which is towards the tipper end of the range reported for peats generally. Laboratory tests yielded similar values of K to those obtained from the slug tests. Although the laboratory tests showed that the peat was anisotropic, the K values generated by slug testing proved relatively good estimates of both vertical and horizontal (c) Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The area of Kurtna Landscape Reserve is situated between oil shale mines. This area is an important part of the Estonia deposit, and the located mining conditions there are good. Narva surface mine pumps groundwater from the area of Kurtna Lakes. It is able to minimize the influence of surface mining. Testing of mining technology and hydrogeological modelling show that mine front may be closed for stopping water flow instead of leaving an open trench by the border of the area of the lakes. According to modeling, hydraulic conductivity of the dam must remain 0.1 m/d to avoid sinking of water level in the lakes, and filtration basins must be supplied with water in an amount of 7000 m(3)/d as yearly average. As the result, the landscape will be reclaimed, overall look and shape will be smoothed. Abandoned fields of peat milling will be reclaimed, and their fires will be avoided.

ID 3 CONTAINER MEDIA; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; GROWTH
AB The potential rate of water and nutrient supply to plant roots depends on the hydraulic properties of the container medium (growth medium, substrate), primarily on its unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, which is a measure of the medium's resistance to water flow. Water availability to plants grown in containers is usually being evaluated using criteria based exclusively on water characteristic curves of the medium in which the plant is grown. This approach is challenged in the present paper. We hypothise that the coarse structure of peat moss as well as of other container media may result in a sharp decrease in hydraulic conductivity, as the water content of peat is reduced. Transient changes in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity may result in reduced water uptake by plant roots. The objectives of this research were to determine the hydraulic properties of sphagnum peat moss and to evaluate their potential effects on water availability. Tuff (granulated volcanic ash) and its mix with peat were also tested for comparison. Water characteristic curves (drying and wetting cycles) and saturated hydraulic conductivity were measured. A predictive mathematical model was used to calculate the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the media. Measured water retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity data were used to estimate model parameters by a nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting technique. Model predictions of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity were validated by direct measurements. Results showed that,sharp variations in hydraulic conductivity occur in a very narrow suction range (0-2.5 kPa). In this range a decrease of more than three orders of magnitude in the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was observed for peat. A similar trend was observed for the other media tested. This suggests that the approach that has been commonly used for determinations of water availability and for irrigation scheduling in container media may provide inaccurate predictions as to potential plant response.

AB Northern peatlands are a diverse group of ecosystems varying along a continuum of hydrological, chemical, and vegetation gradients. These ecosystems contain about one third of the global soil carbon pool, but it is uncertain how carbon and water cycling processes and response to climate change differ among peatland types. This study examines midsummer CO2 and H2O fluxes measured using the eddy covariance technique above seven northern peatlands including a low-shrub bog, two open poor fens, two wooded moderately rich fens, and two open extreme-rich fens. Gross ecosystem production and ecosystem respiration correlated positively with vegetation indices and with each other. Consequently, 24-hour net ecosystem CO2 exchange was similar among most of the sites (an average net carbon sink of 1.5 +/- 0.2 g C m(-2) d(-1)) despite large differences in water table depth, water chemistry, and plant communities. Evapotranspiration was primarily radiatively driven at all sites but a decline in surface conductance with increasing water vapor deficit indicated physiological restrictions to transpiration, particularly at the peatlands with woody vegetation and less at the peatlands with 100% Sphagnum cover. Despite these differences, midday evapotranspiration ranged only from 0.21 to 0.34 mm h(-1) owing to compensation among the factors controlling evapotranspiration. Water use efficiency varied among sites primarily as a result of differences in productivity and plant functional type. Although peatland classification includes a great variety of ecosystem characteristics, peatland type may not be an effective way to predict the magnitude and characteristics of midsummer CO2 and water vapor exchanges.

AB A drained boreal bog with active drainage ditches and the introduction of forage grass was compared with a natural bog site to assess the effect of agricultural drainage on the photosynthetic capacity of boreal peatlands. In this study, the net carbon dioxide uptake and the ecosystem respiration were measured using a pair of clear and dark chambers, connected to a greenhouse gas analyzer in order to estimate the gross primary production (GPP). Environmental factors, including photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), peat soil temperature, soil moisture, electrical conductivity and water table depth (WTD), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soil pore water were also investigated at each site. Our results confirmed a correlation between water table depth, peat soil temperature, electrical conductivity and peatland productivity. Changes in electrical conductivity, water table depth, and peat soil temperature together explained 61% of gross primary productivity variance at our drained peatland pasture site. In general, plant functional types/growth forms did not have any significant difference in their GPP at the drained site except shrubs which had a significantly higher GPP at PAR level greater than 1000 mu mol/m(2)/s (F(3,30.84) = 11.64, p < 0.001). At the natural site, GPP was significantly higher at the hollow (0.168 +/- 0.02 mg/m(2)/s) compared to the hummock (0.098 +/- 0.01 mg/m(2)/s) where relatively the higher WTD was recorded. We therefore concluded that water shortage to the shallow rooting depth of shrubs on our hummock subplots may be the cause of the low productivity. At PAR greater than 1000 mu mol/m(2)/s, productivity at the hollow was still significantly higher (0.17 +/- 0.002 mg/m(2)/s) compared to the hummock (0.10 +/- 0.00 mg/m(2)/s). This suggests that, for ecosystem carbon modelling, the minimum PAR level at which the GPP is estimated is very crucial. All the growth forms at the drained site recorded a significantly higher GPP than the microforms at the natural site. We speculate that not only hydrological changes via agricultural drainage can affect the carbon balance of boreal peatland ecosystem through photosynthesis, but also the hydrological changes in the peat due to the differences in peat soil makeup, structure and density. We, therefore, conclude that differences in microtopography and the corresponding changes in vegetation, land-use practice and its effects on peat soil properties and hydrology should be taken into account when modelling the gross primary production in a peatland ecosystem.

AB This paper presents dating results of AMS C-14, Pb-210 and Cs-137 methods on two young peat profiles from Jinchuan Mire in southeast Jilin of China. JC1 (50-cm long) from a hummock of the mire covers 1962-2007 CE with an accumulation rate of 1.12 cm/y, whereas JCA (92-cm long) from a lawn site involves a 1000-year record with a mean sedimentation of 0.09 cm/y. Comparison of the dating results of the last 100-y part of the peat cores, chronologies based on the AMS C-14 dating are most reliable, because the mobility of Pb-210 and Cs-137 in peat profiles causes overestimation of depositional rate with the larger errors in the deeper layers. The (FC)-C-14 of peat samples were significantly lower than that of the atmospheric CO2 for the post nuclear bomb period because of three reasons: (1) uptake of old CO2 dissolved in the water by aquatic plants during photosynthesis; (2) long-term mixing of the atmospheric CO2 in multiple year growth of the plants; and (3) perhaps dilution effect caused by strong surface runoff. Among these factors, Factor (1) accounts for the major influence. Hence, a "bomb C-14 curve" from a peat profile is necessary for determining post bomb ages. For the pre-nuclear bomb ages, acidbase-acid (ABA) treatment of a peat sample may cause an older-than-true age due to removal of organic acids produced during photosynthesis. This observation calls for detailed investigation of mechanism study and proper pretreatment of peat samples for C-14 dating. The large difference of the depositional rates in the same peatland between JC1 and JCA indicates that estimation of carbon storage in a peatland should be based on the database of multiple sites rather than a couple of cores. For the same reason, one should not use a depositional rate either from a core with distance in the same peatland or from an adjacent peatland.

AB We reconstructed the Holocene developmental history of a kettle-hole peatland in the Tuchola Forest of Northern Poland, using pollen, testat amoebae and plant macrofossil indicators. Our aims were to determine the timing and pattern of autogenic succession and natural and anthropogenic influences on the peatland. Northern Poland is under mixed oceanic and continental climatic influences but has so far been less studied in a palaeoecological context than more oceanic regions of Europe. In the first terrestrial developmental phase of the mire, the testate amoebae-inferred depth to water table revealed two major dry shifts at ca. 9400 (end of lake phase) and ca. 7100 cal BP (a period of global cooling and dry shift in Western Europe). Conditions became wetter again in two steps at ca. 6700 and ca. 5800 BP after a dry event at ca. 6100 BP. The timing of the wet shift at 5800 BP corresponds to wet periods in Western Europe. Peat accumulation rates were low (0.1 mm yr(-1)) between ca. 5600 and ca. 3000 BP when sedges dominated the peatland. In the last 2500 yrs surface moisture fluctuated with wet events at ca. 2750-2400, and 2000 BP, and dry events at ca. 2250-2100 and 1450 BP. After 1450 BP a trend towards wetter conditions culminated at ca. 500 cal BP, possibly caused by local deforestation. Over the mire history, pH (inferred from testate amoebae) was mostly low (around 5) with two short-lived shifts to alkaline conditions (7.5) at ca. 6100 and 1450 BP indicating a minerotrophic influence from surface run-off into the mire. Up to about 1000 BP the ecological shifts inferred from the three proxies agree with palaeoclimatic records from Poland and Western Europe. After this date, however correlation is less clear suggesting an increasing local anthropogenic impact on the mire. This study confirms that kettle-hole peatlands can yield useful palaeoenvironmental data as well as recording land-use change and calls for more comparable studies in regions are the interface between major climate influences.

TI Can the HGM classification of small, non-peat forming wetlands

SO WETLANDS

DT Article
DE Catskill/Delaware watershed; geochemistry; wetland classification
ID UNITED-STATES; FENS
AB We report the results of a detailed 12-month study of 23 freshwater wetlands and one larger synoptic characterization of 55 freshwater wetlands to test whether a hydrogeomorphic (HGM) classification of the wetlands into lotic (attached to streams) and terrene (groundwater fed) classes meaningfully discriminated wetland surface water chemical composition in the mountainous Catskill-Delaware watersheds of southeastern New York State. Most of these hillslope wetlands are underlain by thin, largely siliceous mineral soils and have minimal peat cover. Nonparametric one-way ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis) tests based on measurements of SC, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, DOC, TDN, TDS, Si, SO42-, pH, DO, K+, Cl-, NH4+, NO3-, TDP, and HCO3- failed to reject the null hypothesis that the surface water chemistry of lotic and terrene wetlands was identical. Results of the statistical tests showed that the only significantly different chemical species in surface waters from the two HGM landscape classifications were SC, Na+, and Cl-, which was clearly related to individual wetland proximity to road salt additions. Isotopic analyses of H-2 and O-18 for 30 synoptic wetland surface waters also failed to demonstrate significant differences for any of the HGM wetland classes. Based on the results of these data, we caution that landscape position, landform, water flow path, and water body type may not be accurate in making wetland classifications for HGM assessment in all locations. Underlying geology should be considered before making assumptions that water chemistry will differ by landscape position, and wetland functions dependent on water chemistry should be evaluated accordingly.

AB Integrated buffer zones (IBZ) are novel mitigation measures designed to decrease the loading of nitrogen (N) transported by subsurface drainage systems from agricultural fields to streams. In IBZ, drainage water flows into a pond with free water surface followed by an inundated, vegetated filterbed. This design provides an environment favorable for denitrification and thus a decrease in nitrate concentration is expected as water flow through the IBZ. However, due to the establishment of anaerobic conditions, there is a risk for increasing emissions of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). In this year-long study, we evaluated the N removal efficiency along with the risk of N2O and CH4 emissions from two pilot-scale IBZs (IBZ1 and 2). The two IBZs had very different yearly removal efficiencies, amounting to 29% and 71% of the total N load at IBZ1 and 2, respectively. This was probably due to differences in infiltration rates to the filterbed, which was 22% and 81% of the incoming water at IBZ1 and 2, respectively. The site (IBZ2) with the highest removal efficiency was a net N2O sink, while 0.9% of the removed nitrate was emitted as N2O at IBZ1. Both IBZs were net sources of CH4 but with different pathways of emission. In IBZ1 CH4 was mainly lost directly to the atmosphere, while waterborne losses dominated in IBZ2. In conclusion, the IBZs were effective in removing N three years after establishment, and although the IBZs acted as greenhouse gas sources, especially due to CH4, the emissions were comparable to those of natural wetlands and other drainage transport mitigation measures.

TI Leaching and surface runoff after fall application of fungicides on
   putting greens
SO AGRONOMY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
AB Many greenkeepers and authorities are concerned about the environmental risks resulting from pesticide use on golf courses. We studied leaching and surface runoff of fungicides and metabolites for two winter seasons after fall application of boscalid, pyraclostrobin, prothioconazole, trifloxystrobin, and fludioxonil in field lysimeters at NIBIO Landvik, Norway. The applications were made on creeping bentgrass greens (5% slope) that had been established from seed or sod (26-mm mat) on USGA-specification. root zones amended with Sphagnum peat or garden compost, both with 0.3-0.4% organic carbon in the root zone. The proportions of the winter precipitation recovered as surface and drainage water varied from 3 and 91% in 2016-2017 to 33 and 55% in 2017-2018 due to differences in soil freezing, rainfall intensity, and snow and ice cover. Detections of fungicides and their metabolites in drainage water were mostly within the environmental risk limits (ERLs) for aquatic organisms. In contrast, concentrations in surface runoff exceeded ERLs by up to 1,000 times. Greens established from sod usually had higher fungicide losses in surface runoff but lower losses in drainage water than greens established from seed. Presumably because of higher microbial activity and a higher pH that made prothioconazole-desthio more polar, fungicide and metabolite losses in drainage water were usually higher from greens containing compost that from greens containing peat. Leaching of fungicides and metabolites occurred even from frozen greens. The results are discussed in a practical context aiming for reduced environmental risks from spraying fungicides against turfgrass winter diseases.

TI Biological processes controlling the development of modern peat-forming
   ecosystems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID MIRE; COAL
AB Although no precise modern analogue exists for the peat-forming ecosystems (mires) of Tertiary times, it is argued that the principles underlying peat formation are essentially unchanged in the sense that a peat-forming ecosystem has an incomplete decomposition process (normally because of waterlogging) , leaving a residue of organic material in its overall energy-Row budget. The study of modern mires is therefore of relevance to Tertiary coal geologists, The classification of modern mires is best achieved by reference to their hydrological characteristics, particularly the source of water entering the system. Flow-fed (rheotrophic) mires are often relatively rich in nutrients and elastic, while rainfed (ombrotrophic) mires are poor. The transition from one hydrological state to the other can occur during mire development and involves a physical elevation of the mire surface by the growth of peat.
   Such mires have a two-layered (diplotelmic) structure in which the surface layer (acrotelm) is periodically aerobic, has a loose structure and a high hydraulic conductivity, while the lower layer (catotelm) is compacted, anaerobic and has a low hydraulic conductivity. The hydrological outcome is that precipitation landing upon a raised, ombrotrophic mire drains from the elevated mire surface laterally through the acrotelm. The water retention of the mire and its elevated water table is dependent on the poor water conductivity of the catotelm. The transition to the ombrotrophic condition is accompanied by higher rates of pear accumulation and increasing mire acidity. It begins with isolated colonization of hummock-forming plants that later converge into an extended cupola. This ecological transition may be a consequence of external changes, such as climatic alteration (increased precipitation: evaporation ratio) or autogenic, internal successional developments. Basin subsidence, however, or eustatic sea-level rise in the case of coastal systems, can operate in the reverse direction and prevent the permanent establishment of an ombrotrophic system.
   The ombrotrophic mire is ultimately limited in the depth of its pear development by microbial respiration within the catotelm. As the catotelm extends with pear accumulation, the total respiratory activity of the profile will equilibrate with primary productivity and peat formation slows down to an eventual standstill. On the assumption that peatland hydrology operated in a similar way in former times, the deep peats (and eventually coals) of Tertiary times can best be explained, therefore, in terms of stacks of sequential mires rather than single, continuously forming ecosystems.

AB Peatland water table depth is an important control on runoff production, plant growth and carbon cycling. Many peatlands have been drained but are now subject to activities that might lead to their restoration including the damming of artificial drains. This paper investigates water table dynamics on intact, drained and restored peatland slopes in a blanket peat in northern England using transects of automated water table recorders. Long-term (18 month), seasonal and short-term (storm event) records are explored. The restored site had drains blocked 6 years prior to monitoring commencing. The spatially-weighted mean water table depths over an 18 month period were -5.8 cm, -8.9 cm and -11.5 cm at the intact, restored and drained sites respectively. Most components of water table behaviour at the restored site, including depth exceedance probability curves, seasonality of water table variability, and water table responses to individual rainfall events were intermediate between that of the drained and intact sites. Responses also depended on location with respect to the drains. The results show that restoration of drained blanket peat is difficult and the water table dynamics may not function in the same way as those in undisturbed blanket peat even many years after management intervention. Further measurement of hydrological processes and water table responses to peatland restoration are required to inform land managers of the hydrological success of those projects.

AB Measurements were made of the concentrations of total and hydrophilic disserved organic carbon (DOC) and optical absorbance at 340 nm (A(340)) in two pools (X and Y) situated in an area of peat on Great Dun Fell, North Pennines, UK, between November 1992 and December 1996. Other chemical data were also collected. Pool X was acid (pH 3.9-5.3) while Poor Y was circumneutral (pH 5.8-6.9). Concentrations of DOC in the two pools displayed similar seasonal variations, ranging from as;low as 5 mg L-1 in winter to 20 mg L-1 or more in late summer and early autumn. The ratio of hydrophilic to total DOC also showed a seasonal trend, with the highest values observed during the summer months. During the period to mid-1995, the ratio of A(340)/DOC in both pools was nearly constant, but fell by 50% following a two-month period of drought, during which time the pools were dry, remaining at the lower value throughout the remainder of the sampling period. Through a series of salt addition experiments, estimates of water flow through the pools were made during two separate periods (2 weeks and 3 weeks). The results were consistent with flows calculated using a simple rainfall-runoff model, driven by rainfall inputs, and taking into account the size and slopes of the catchment. Water flow was strongly correlated with rainfall amount and frequency, and the model could therefore be used to estimate flows; over the entire sampling period. The flows were combined with concentration data to estimate fluxes of DOC. The fluxes in 1993 and 1994 were similar (15 g m(-2) a(-1)) and showed a strong seasonality, with most carbon passing through the pools during the late summer and autumn. In 1995, a year of low rainfall and high temperatures, the flux was only 7.0 g m(-2) a(-1), increasing again to 10 g m(-2) a(-1) in 1996. The results were interpreted in terms of production of dissolvable organic matter within the catchment soils during summer, and export associated with subsequent high rainfall events. The climatic conditions of 1995 appeared to have restricted the soil production of dissolvable organic matter. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Forested peatlands are widespread in boreal regions of Canada, and these ecosystems, which are major terrestrial carbon sinks, are undergoing significant transformations linked to climate change, fires and human activities. This study targets millennial-scale vegetation dynamics and related hydrological variability in forested peatlands of the Clay Belt south of James Bay, eastern Canada, using palaeoecological data. Changes in peatland vegetation communities were reconstructed using plant macrofossil analyses, and variations in water-table depths were inferred using testate amoeba analyses. High-resolution analyses of macroscopic charcoal >0.5 mm were used to reconstruct local fire history. Our data showed two successional pathways towards the development of present-day forested peatlands influenced by autogenic processes such as vertical peat growth and related drying, and allogenic factors such as the occurrence of local fires. The oldest documented peatland initiated in a wet rich fen around 8000 cal. a BP shortly after land emergence and transformed into a drier forested bog rapidly after peat inception that persisted over millennia. In the second site, peat started to accumulate from similar to 5200 cal. a BP over a mesic coniferous forest that shifted into a wet forested peatland following a fire that partially consumed the organic layer similar to 4600 cal. a BP. The charcoal records show that fires rarely occurred in these peatlands, but they have favoured the process of forest paludification and influenced successional trajectories over millennia. The macrofossil data suggest that Picea mariana (black spruce) persisted on the peatlands throughout their development, although there were periods of more open canopy due to local fires in some cases. This study brings new understanding on the natural variability of boreal forested peatlands which may help predict their response to future changes in climate, fire regimes and anthropogenic disturbances.

AB The relationship between water chemistry and vegetation was studied in a coastal ombrotrophic mire in northern Hokkaido, Japan. The distributions of Sphagnum and Phragmites communities were separated clearly by the pH and ion concentration of the peat surface-pore water. The drainage ditches along the road across the center of the mire had a high pH and ion concentration, as did the peat water in the western part of the mire. It was found that fields used for livestock farming on a hill to the west of the mire leached materials into the mire through drainage ditches, surface runoff, and probably also through ground water, and thus influenced the water chemistry of the mire. Management of the water, including that in the catchment of the mire, should be introduced before biological buffering capacity against excess nutrient loading caused by human activity is exceeded and the mire loses its ombrotrophic status.

AB Regular spatial patterns of sharply bounded ridges and hollows are frequently observed in peatlands and ask for an explanation in terms of underlying structuring processes. Simulation models suggest that spatial regularity of peatland patterns could be driven by an evapotranspiration-induced scale-dependent feedback (locally positive, longer-range negative) between ridge vegetation and nutrient availability. The sharp boundaries between ridges and hollows could be induced by a positive feedback between net rate of peat formation and acrotelm thickness. Theory also predicts how scale-dependent and positive feedbacks drive underlying patterns in nutrients, hydrology, and hydrochemistry, but these predictions have not yet been tested empirically. The aim of this study was to provide an empirical test for the theoretical predictions; therefore, we measured underlying patterns in nutrients, hydrology, and hydrochemistry across a maze-patterned peatland in the Great Vasyugan Bog, Siberia. The field data corroborated predicted patterns as induced by scale-dependent feedback; nutrient concentrations were higher on ridges than in hollows. Moreover, diurnal dynamics in water table level clearly corresponded to evapotranspiration and showed that water levels in two ridges were lower than in the hollow in between. Also, the data on hydrochemistry suggested that evapotranspiration rates were higher on ridges. The bimodal frequency distribution in acrotelm thickness indicated sharp boundaries between ridges and hollows, supporting the occurrence of a positive feedback. Moreover, nutrient content in plant tissue was most strongly associated with acrotelm thickness, supporting the view that positive feedback further amplifies ridge-hollow differences in nutrient status. Our measurements are consistent with the hypothesis that the combination of scale-dependent and positive feedback induces peatland patterning.

AB Peat deposits contain on the order of 1/6 of the Earth's terrestrial fixed carbon (C), but uncertainty in peat depth precludes precise estimates of peat C storage. To assess peat C in the Northern Highlands Lake District (NHLD), a similar to 7000 km(2) region in northern Wisconsin, United States, with 20% peatland by area, we sampled 21 peatlands. In each peatland, peat depth (including basal organic lake sediment, where present) was measured on a grid and interpolated to calculate mean depth. Our study addressed three questions: (1) How spatially variable is peat depth? (2) To what degree can mean peat depth be predicted from other field measurements (water chemistry, water table depth, vegetation cover, slope) and/or remotely sensed spatial data? (3) How much C is stored in NHLD peatlands? Site mean peat depth ranged from 0.1 to 5.1 m. Most of the peatlands had been formed by the in-filling of small lake basins (terrestrialization), and depths up to 15 m were observed. Mean peat depth for small peat basins could be best predicted from basin edge slope at the peatland/upland interface, either measured in the field or calculated from digital elevation (DEM) data (Adj. R(2) = 0.70). Upscaling using the DEM-based regression gave a regional mean peat depth of 2.1 +/- 0.2 m (including similar to 0.1-0.4 m of organic lake sediment) and 144 +/- 21 Tg-C in total. As DEM data are widely available, this technique has the potential to improve C storage estimates in regions with peatlands formed primarily by terrestrialization.

AB This study presents paleohydrological reconstructions from ombrotrophic peatlands (bogs) along the north shore of the Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence in eastern Canada. Past water table depths were reconstructed based on testate amoebae analyses within four peatlands from two maritime ecoclimatic regions (boreal and subarctic) using a new transfer function. The comparison of multiple peat-based paleohydrological records was used to distinguish climate-driven changes from variations related to site-specific factors. Coherence between the water table reconstructions at the regional scale suggests a common climatic influence on bog paleohydrology but there are inconsistencies which also suggest an influence of non-climatic factors (e.g. internal peatland processes and feedbacks). The surface drying and increased hydrological variability after 3000 cal a BP in the studied bogs coincide with the transition from the Holocene Climatic Optimum to the Neoglacial cooling documented by proxy climate records in eastern Canada. The bogs of Havre St-Pierre have experienced major drying during the late Holocene, indicating important annual-to-centennial water deficits at the peatland surface. Regional differences in the magnitude of the hydrological fluctuations may result from distinctive climatic conditions or could indicate that bog surface wetness in the Gulf of St. Lawrence was more sensitive to past climate changes.

AB Northern peatlands contain 1/3 of the world's soil carbon pool. Blanket bogs are peatlands that occur in maritime regions where precipitation is much greater than evapotranspiration. The role of blanket bogs in C dynamics has not been quantified. We describe an investigation of CO2 fluxes using an eddy covariance (EC) system in a pristine Atlantic blanket bog in Ireland during 2003 and 2004. This is the first multiyear study using EC techniques in a blanket bog. We found that the bog ecosystem was a CO2 sink for five months in each year. The annual CO2 flux had a sink magnitude of -49 ( 2003) and -61 g C m(-2) (2004). These magnitudes are similar to boreal raised bogs, while higher values have been reported for boreal fens and lower for subarctic fens.

AB Northern mires (fens and bogs) have significant climate feedbacks and contribute to biodiversity, providing habitats to specialized biota. Many studies have found drying and degradation of bogs in response to climate change, while northern fens have received less attention. Rich fens are particularly important to biodiversity, but subject to global climate change, fen ecosystems may change via direct response of vegetation or indirectly by hydrological changes. With repeated sampling over the past 20 years, we aim to reveal trends in hydrology and vegetation in a pristine boreal fen with gradient from rich to poor fen and bog vegetation. We resampled 203 semi-permanent plots and compared water-table depth (WTD), pH, concentrations of mineral elements, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), plant species occurrences, community structure, and vegetation types between 1998 and 2018. In the study area, the annual mean temperature rose by 1.0 degrees C and precipitation by 46 mm, in 20-year periods prior to sampling occasions. We found that wet fen vegetation decreased, while bog and poor fen vegetation increased significantly. This reflected a trend of increasing abundance of common, generalist hummock species at the expense of fen specialist species. Changes were the most pronounced in high pH plots, where Sphagnum mosses had significantly increased in plot frequency, cover, and species richness. Changes of water chemistry were mainly insignificant in concentration levels and spatial patterns. Although indications toward drier conditions were found in vegetation, WTD had not consistently increased, instead, our results revealed complex dynamics of WTD as depending on vegetation changes. Overall, we found significant trend in vegetation, conforming to common succession pattern from rich to poor fen and bog vegetation. Our results suggest that responses intrinsic to vegetation, such as increased productivity or altered species interactions, may be more significant than indirect effects via local hydrology to the ecosystem response to climate warming.

AB Anthropogenic disturbance (drainage and peat harvesting works in adjacent area) accelerates water outflow from and mineralization of top peat layer in the raised bog of Aukstumala Telmological Reserve (Western Lithuania) thus inducing peatland degradation and promoting penetration of atypical plant species and woody vegetation. Possibilities of restoration of the most affected parts of the Aukstumala raised bog (contact zone of the bog and peat harvesting fields) were investigated. Specifically, we aimed to assess effectiveness of two different means of hydrological regime restoration installed in the contact zone: (i) bog isolation from peat harvesting fields (to prevent direct water runoff) using polyethylene membrane (PM measure, installed in November 2006) and "peat lock" system (PL measure: water runoff blocked by highly decomposed peat; installed in November 2010), and (ii) blocking of ditches of the old drainage system using peat dams (PD measure, installed in November 2012). The research was carried out by performing monthly (from April to October) water level measurements in a system of water level monitoring profiles installed in zones of impact of each measure and non-treated (control) areas. Moreover, dendrochronological analysis of pine growth was performed in PM-treated and control areas.
   Although in general positive effect of the applied treatments (raised water table, reduced amplitudes of seasonal water level fluctuation, reduced radial increment of pine trees, re-establishment of Sphagnum cover) could be observed, none of the three measures has fully restored hydrological regime to create favourable conditions for peat accumulation and thriving of typical raised bog communities. The results of the present study suggest that aiming to more efficiently regulate hydrological regime in drainage-affected parts of the Aukstumala raised bog, blocking or filling of the old drainage system should always be applied in combination with the installation of water insulation measures along the contact zone of the bog and peat harvesting fields. Longer observation time is needed to fully assess the effect of the installed restoration measures on hydrology and ecosystem functioning in the raised bog of Aukstumala Telmological Reserve.

AB Sphagnum peatlands in the oceanic-continental transition zone of Poland are currently influenced by climatic and anthropogenic factors that lead to peat desiccation and susceptibility to fire. Little is known about the response of Sphagnum peatland testate amoebae (TA) to the combined effects of drought and fire. To understand the relationships between hydrology and fire dynamics, we used high-resolution multi-proxy palaeoecological data to reconstruct 2000 years of mire history in northern Poland. We employed a new approach for Polish peatlands joint TA-based water table depth and charcoal-inferred fire activity reconstructions. In addition, the response of most abundant TA hydrological indicators to charcoal-inferred fire activity was assessed. The results show four hydrological stages of peatland development: moderately wet (from similar to 35 BC to 800 AD), wet (from similar to 800 to 1390 AD), dry (from similar to 1390 to 1700 AD) and with an instable water table (from similar to 1700 to 2012 AD). Fire activity has increased in the last millennium after constant human presence in the mire surroundings. Higher fire activity caused a rise in the water table, but later an abrupt drought appeared at the onset of the Little Ice Age. This dry phase is characterized by high ash contents and high charcoal-inferred fire activity. Fires preceded hydrological change and the response of TA to fire was indirect. Peatland drying and hydrological instability was connected with TA community changes from wet (dominance of Archerella flavum, Hyalosphenia papilio, Amphitrema wrightianum) to dry (dominance of Cryptodifflugia ovilormis, Euglypha rotunda); however, no clear fire indicator species was found. Anthropogenic activities can increase peat fires and cause substantial hydrology changes. Our data suggest that increased human fire activity was one of the main factors that influenced peatland hydrology, though the mire response through hydrological changes towards drier conditions was delayed in relation to the surrounding vegetation changes.

ID GROUNDWATER; SEVERITY
AB Northern peatlands are important global carbon stores, but there is concern that these boreal peat reserves are at risk due to increased fire frequency and severity as predicted by climate change models. In a subhumid climate, hydrogeological position is an important control on peatland hydrology and wildfire vulnerability. Consequently, we hypothesized that in a coarse-textured glaciofluvial outwash, isolated peatlands lacking the moderating effect of large-scale groundwater flow would have greater water table (WT) variability and would also be more vulnerable to deep WT drawdown and wildfire during dry climate cycles. A holistic approach was taken to evaluate 3 well-accepted factors that are associated with smouldering in boreal peatlands: hollow microform coverage, peatland margin morphometry, and gravimetric water content. Using a combination of field measurements (bulk density, humification, WT position, hummock-hollow distribution, and margin width) and modelling (1-D vertical unsaturated flow coupled with a simple peat-fuel energy balance equation), we assessed the vulnerability of peat to smouldering. We found that a peatland in the regionally intermediate topographic position is the most vulnerable to smouldering due to the interaction of variable connectivity to large-scale groundwater flow and the absence of mineral stratigraphy for limiting WT declines during dry conditions. Our findings represent a novel assessment framework and tool for fire managers by providing a priori knowledge of potential peat smouldering hot spot locations in the landscape to efficiently allocate resources and reduce emergency response time to smouldering events.

AB Fen plant growth in peat contaminated with groundwater discharges of oil sands process water (OSPW) was assessed in a greenhouse over two growing seasons. Three treatments (non-diluted OSPW, diluted OSPW and rainwater) were tested on five vascular plants and four mosses. All vascular plants tested can grow in salinity and naphthenic acids levels currently produced by oil sands activity in northwestern Canada. No stress sign was observed after both seasons. Because of plant characteristics. Carex species (C atherodes and C. utriculata) and Triglochin maritima would be more useful for rapidly restoring vegetation and creating a new peat-accumulating system. Groundwater discharge of OSPW proved detrimental to mosses under dry conditions and ensuring adequate water levels would be crucial in fen creation following oil sands exploitation. Campylium stellatum would be the best choice to grow in contaminated areas and Bryum pseudotriquetrum might be interesting as it has spontaneously regenerated in all treatments.

AB Ditch blocking in blanket peatlands is common as part of peatland restoration. The effects of ditch blocking on flow regimes and nearby water tables were examined in a field trial. After an initial 6-month monitoring period, eight ditches had peat dams installed 10m apart along their entire length (dammed), four of these ditches were also partially infilled through bank reprofiling (reprofiled). Four ditches were left open with no dams or reprofiling (open). These 12 ditches and the surrounding peat were monitored for 4more years. An initial five-fold reduction in discharge occurred in the dammed and the reprofiled ditches with the displaced water being diverted to overland flow and pathways away from the ditches. However, there was a gradual change over time in ditch flow regime in subsequent years, with the overall volume of water leaving the dammed and the reprofiled ditches increasing per unit of rainfall to around twice that which occurred in the first year after blocking. Hence, monitoring for greater than one year is important for understanding hydrological impacts of peatland restoration. Overland flow and flow in the upper similar to 4cm of peat was common and occurred in the inter-ditch areas for over half of the time after ditch blocking. There was strong evidence that topographic boundaries of small ditch catchments, despite being defined using a high-resolution Light Detection And Ranging-based terrain model, were not always equivalent to actual catchment areas. Hence, caution is needed when upscaling area-based fluxes, such as aquatic carbon fluxes, from smaller scale studies including those using ditches and small streams. The effect of ditch blocking on local water tables was spatially highly variable but small overall (time-weighted mean effect <2cm). Practitioners seeking to raise water tables through peatland restoration should first be informed either by prior measurement of water tables or by spatial modelling to show whether the peatland already has shallow water tables or whether there are locations that could potentially undergo large water-table recoveries.

AB Permafrost degradation in the peat-rich southern fringe of the discontinuous permafrost zone is catalysing substantial changes to land cover with expansion of permafrost-free wetlands (bogs and fens) and shrinkage of forest-dominated permafrost peat plateaux. Predicting discharge from headwater basins in this region depends upon understanding and numerically representing the interactions between storage and discharge within and between the major land cover types and how these interactions are changing. To better understand the implications of advanced permafrost thaw-induced land cover change on wetland discharge, with all landscape features capable of contributing to drainage networks, the hydrological behaviour of a channel fen sub-basin in the headwaters of Scotty Creek, Northwest Territories, Canada, dominated by peat plateau-bog complexes, was modelled using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform for the period of 2009 to 2015. The model construction was based on field water balance observations, and performance was deemed adequate when evaluated against measured water balance components. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of progressive permafrost loss on discharge from the sub-basin, in which all units of the sub-basin have the potential to contribute to the drainage network, by incrementally reducing the ratio of wetland to plateau in the modelled sub-basin. Simulated reductions in permafrost extent decreased total annual discharge from the channel fen by 2.5% for every 10% decrease in permafrost area due to increased surface storage capacity, reduced run-off efficiency, and increased landscape evapotranspiration. Runoff ratios for the fen hydrological response unit dropped from 0.54 to 0.48 after the simulated 50% permafrost area loss with a substantial reduction of 0.47 to 0.31 during the snowmelt season. The reduction in peat plateau area resulted in decreased seasonal variability in discharge due to changes in the flow path routing, with amplified low flows associated with small increases in subsurface discharge, and decreased peak discharge with large reductions in surface run-off.

Pb concentrations in the outflow stream from the peatland measured from 2009-2015 indicated continued mobilization and export of Pb derived from historic inputs to the bog. In contrast, Pb concentrations in surface peat and runoff from upland mineral soils have declined in response to reductions in atmospheric deposition. Relative to the early 1980s, Pb concentrations in the streamflow decreased only 50%, while Pb in surface peat and upland subsurface runoff decreased by more than 90%. Water level fluctuations in the slow accumulating peat have allowed dissolved organic matter (DOM) to continue mobilizing Pb deposited in the peatland decades earlier. Strong correlations between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and Pb concentrations in outflow from the peatland and in bog porewaters demonstrate Pb mobility related to DOM production. Peat stores of Pb in 2016 were less than or equal to those reported in the early 1980s despite the dry mass inventory increasing by 60-80%. Much of the loss in Pb stored in peat can be accounted for by stream runoff from the peatland.

AB In peatland palaeoecological studies, the preparation of peat samples for testate amoebae (TA) analysis involves boiling of samples and microsieving them through a 15-mu m sieve. We studied the effect of these preparation stages on the estimation of TA assemblages and on the reconstruction of water table depths (WTD). Our results indicate that the TA assemblages of boiled and unboiled samples are not significantly different, while microsieving reduces the concentration of small TA taxa and results in significantly different TA assemblages. The differences between microsieved and unsieved TA assemblages were reflected also in predicted values of WTD, which indicated drier conditions in case of unsieved samples than in microsieved samples. We conclude that the boiling of samples might be omitted if TA are extracted from the fresh peat samples. Microsieving may lead to erroneous palaeoecological WTD reconstructions and should be avoided if small TA taxa are present in samples.

AB Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) spawn in fall and overwintering egg development can benefit from stable, relatively warm temperatures in groundwater-seepage zones. However, eggs are also sensitive to dissolved oxygen concentration, which may be reduced in discharging groundwater (i.e., seepage). We investigated a 2 km reach of the coastal Quashnet River in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, to relate preferred fish spawning habitats to geology, geomorphology, and discharging groundwater geochemistry. Thermal reconnaissance methods were used to locate zones of rapid groundwater discharge, which were predominantly found along the central channel of a wider stream valley section. Pore-water chemistry and temporal vertical groundwater flux were measured at a subset of these zones during field campaigns over several seasons. Seepage zones in open-valley sub-reaches generally showed suboxic conditions and higher dissolved solutes compared to the underlying glacial outwash aquifer. These discharge zones were cross-referenced with preferred brook trout redds and evaluated during 10 years of observation, all of which were associated with discrete alcove features in steep cutbanks, where stream meander bends intersect the glacial valley walls. Seepage in these repeat spawning zones was generally stronger and more variable than in open-valley sites, with higher dissolved oxygen and reduced solute concentrations. The combined evidence indicates that regional groundwater discharge along the broader valley bottom is predominantly suboxic due to the influence of near-stream organic deposits; trout show no obvious preference for these zones when spawning. However, the meander bends that cut into sandy deposits near the valley walls generate strong oxic seepage zones that are utilized routinely for redd construction and the overwintering of trout eggs. Stable water isotopic data support the conclusion that repeat spawning zones are located directly on preferential discharges of more localized groundwater. In similar coastal systems with extensive valley peat deposits, the specific use of groundwater-discharge points by brook trout may be limited to morphologies such as cutbanks, where groundwater flow paths do not encounter substantial buried organic material and remain oxygen-rich.

AB The vegetation of a subalpine fen in Colorado was studied. Insight was sought into the community structure and factors influencing species distribution of a vegetation type heretofore undescribed in the southern Rocky Mountains. A vegetational gradient was evaluated using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). Four types of vegetation were subjectively defined; these same types were distinguished by the DCA. DCA further revealed marked differences in the vegetation occurring on peat hummocks versus in hollows. Species composition was related to environment using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Water-table depth, hummock height, shading, groundwater temperature, and conductivity were significantly correlated with species distribution, accounting for 51% of the total species variance. Univariate regression was used to examine how tree density varied with environment. The above factors, except for shading and conductivity, were also significantly correlated with tree density. It is suggested that the peat hummocks that form on this moderate fen provide an environment similar to that of an ombrotrophic bog and that these ''miniature bogs'' form in areas unable to support expansive bogs. Further, these hummocks provide small-scale environmental heterogeneity that exerts a strong control over species composition that would not be evident in studies based on samples of a large areal extent.

AB Drainage of peatlands for forestry often leads to carbon dioxide (CO2) net emission from soil due to loss of peat. This emission can be compensated for by the increased tree growth. Hovewer, many drained peatlands have low tree growth due to nutrient limitations. Tree growth at these peatlands can be effectively increased by fertilization, but fertilization has been also found to increase decomposition rates.
   We studied the long-term effect of fertilization of low-productive forestry-drained peatlands on the complete ecosystem greenhouse gas exchange, including both soil and tree component, and accounting for CO2, methane and nitrous oxide. Five N-rich study sites (flark fens and a rich fen) and one N-poor ombrotrophic site were established. Fertilization had started at the study sites 16-67 years before our measurements.
   Fertilization considerably increased tree stand CO2 sink ( + 248-1013 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1)). Decomposition increased on average by 45% ( + 431 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1)) and litter production by 38% ( + 360 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1)). Thus, on average 84% of the increased decomposition could be attributed to increased litter production and 16% to increased soil CO 2 net emission due to increased loss of peat. Soil CO2 net emission correlated positively with water table depth and top soil N concentration.
   Fertilization increased soil CO2 net emission at the drained flark fens on average by 187 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1). At the rich fen, net emission decreased. The N-poor bog exhibited soil CO2 sink both with and without fertilization. Effects on methane and nitrous oxide emissions were small at most sites.
   The increase in tree stand CO2 sink was higher than the increase in soil CO2 net emission, indicating that fertilization has a climate cooling effect in the decadal time scale. Yet, as the fertilized plots at N-rich sites exhibited soil CO2 source or zero balance, continuation of fertilization-based forestry over several rotations would lead to progressive loss of ecosystem C. At the N-poor bog, fertilization-based forestry may have a climate-cooling effect also in the centennial time scale.

AB Aim The formation of a local vegetation mosaic may be attributed to local variation in abiotic environmental conditions. Recent research, however, indicates that self-facilitating organisms and negative species interactions may be a driving factor. In this study, we explore whether heterogeneous geohydrological conditions or vegetation feedbacks and interactions could be responsible for a vegetation mosaic of rich and poor fen species.
   Location Lake Aturtaun, Roundstone Bog, Ireland.
   Methods In a floating fen, transects were set out to analyze the relation between vegetation type and rock-peat distance and porewater electrical conductivity. Furthermore, three distinct vegetation types were studied: rich fen, poor fen and patches of poor fen within rich fen vegetation. Biogeochemical measurements were conducted in a vertical profile to distinguish abiotic conditions of distinct vegetation types.
   Results Geohydrological conditions may drive the distribution of poor and rich fen species at a larger scale in the floating fen, due to the supply of minerotrophic groundwater. Interestingly, both rich and poor fen vegetation occurred in a mosaic, when electrical conductivity values at 50 cm depth were between 300 mu S/cm and 450 mu S/cm. Although environmental conditions were homogeneous at 50 cm, they differed markedly between rich and poor fen vegetation at 10 cm depth. Specifically, our measurements indicate that poor fen vegetation lowered porewater alkalinity, bicarbonate concentrations and pH. No effects of rich fen vegetation at 10 cm depth on biogeochemistry was measured. However, rich fen litter had a higher mineralization rate than poor fen litter, which increases the influence of minerotrophic water in rich fen habitat.
   Conclusions These results strengthen our hypothesis that species can drive formation of vegetation mosaics under environmentally homogeneous conditions in a floating fen. Positive intraspecific self-facilitating mechanisms and negative species interactions could be responsible for a stable coexistence of species, even leading to local ecosystem engineering by the species, explaining the local vegetation mosaic at the microscale level in a floating fen.

AB Twenty-one coal samples of Seam 11 from the Antaibao Mine, Ningwu Coalfield, Shanxi Province, were analyzed by microscopic method. The macerals were identified and their ratios were calculated. The vitrinite contents decrease and the inertinite contents increase from bottom to top of the seam section. The data were used as indicators in the definition of different types of coal facies and hydrodynamic condition diagrams. The results indicate that the peat moor of Seam 11 might be formed in a regression environment, and it can be divided into 7 secondary regression processes. The peats evolved from low-open moor to dry-forest moor. The water depth of the moor decreased, and activity of water flowing decreased.

AB The objective of this study was to show that temperate zone fens could be constructed on a surface of glacial gravel or a surface without preformed hydric soil. A reference study examined the construction of a fen on remnants of a buried fen. Each construct was replicated in four sections planted with seeds, greenhouse-grown stock or natural fen plant communities. An artesian well supplied high carbonate water through the subsurface. After 8 years, each fen contained 71 species in common, the gravel-based fen had 28 additional species and the soil-based fen had 21 additional species. On the third year, the gravel-based fen began producing calcareous peat composed of brown mosses and by the eighth year a 10 cm layer of peat covered most of the surface. The gravel-based fen produced short and less densely distributed plants than the soil-based fen but the gravel-based fen had a greater number of rare plants. While most plantings had a high degree of survival the naturally derived plugs were the most successful and the seed produced the fewest survivors. We show that, given continuous groundwater supply, it is possible to produce a high diversity fen-like environment on either substrate. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A release of 1,2-dichloroethane, also known as ethylene dichloride (EDC), resulted in shallow subsurface free-phase contamination of a Gulf Coast site in the southern United States. The site stratigraphy consists primarily of a low permeability, surficial peat, silt, and clay zone underlain by fractured clay; a confined 12 m deep sand ground water flow zone; a confined 21 m deep fine sand zone of limited ground water flow followed by a deep aquitard. The Gumbo clay and sandy clay aquitard below the release area overlies and protects the 61 m deep Upper Chicot Aquifer, which is a confined regional aquifer. An ongoing recovery and hydraulic containment program from the primary impacted and laterally and vertically restricted shallow 40-foot sand zone has effectively recovered dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) and contained dissolved phase EDC. Natural attenuation of EDC was demonstrated through (1) a laboratory microcosm study substantiating the ability of the native microbial population in the deeper aquifer to degrade EDC under anaerobic environmental conditions found at the site, (2) field investigations showing reductions in EDC concentrations over time in many of the wells on site, and (3) an evaluation of the ground water for EDC and its degradation products and other geochemical parameters such as dissolved oxygen, redox potential, and pH. Degradation products of EDC found in the field investigations included 2-chloroethanol, ethanol. ethene, and ethane. Dissolved EDC concentrations in selected wells between the first recorded samples and the fourth quarter of 1997 ranged from greater than 4% to 99% reductions. First-order exponential decay half-lives ranged from 0.21 to 4.2 years for wells showing decreases in EDC concentrations over time. Elevated methane concentrations indicated carbon dioxide to be the major terminal electron acceptor.

AB The coastal ridge-swale systems in the west Estonian archipelago (Roogu, Loimastu) and on the northern coast (Juminda), where wave and wind-built ridges are separated from each other by wet depressions, contain the records on ancient shoreline positions, major storm events and forest fires. The results are based on cartographic analysis, ground-penetrating radar survey, coring and radiocarbon dating. Seaward tilted layers in lower parts of the ridges refer to storm scarps. Water level rise and acidic waters flowing from ridges favour the accumulation of Sphagnum peat in swales. The main soil-forming processes are podzolization on ridges and paludification in swales. The obtained results show a clear dependence of soil-forming conditions and development of peat layer on morphology and dimensions of landforms, character of parent material, vegetation type and groundwater table. Paludification will lead to a complete burial of the ridges under peat turning the areas to homogeneous bog landscape.

AB A palaeoecological study of a subarctic minerotrophic peatland was undertaken to reconstruct the formation of the site as an archive of slope geomorphological processes. The study peatland is located about 400 m from Caribou slope (unofficial name) on Lepage Island, Lac Wiyashakimi, Nunavik (northern Quebec, Canada). The site is close to the lakeshore and receives runoff directly from Caribou slope and its catchment. Gravity processes have been active on Caribou slope since the deglaciation of the region at approximately 6000 cal. yr BP. These processes may be differentiated in terms of Holocene stages of intensity. The objective of our study was to detect evidence of gravity processes in the peatland and to note their frequency since its establishment using loss-on-ignition testing, macrofossil analysis and radiocarbon dating. Our results indicate that peat began to accumulate over the sandy-gravelly sediments at around 4900 cal. yr BP. Larix Laricina, Carex aquatilis and Carex rostrata were present at this time until 4660 cal. yr BP, at which point these taxa were replaced by aquatic taxa such as Hippuris vulgaris and Daphnia (aquatic invertebrates). The percentage of mineral sediments (sand) remained high during this period, which could be linked to slope activity. After 4660 cal. yr BP, sandy sediments diminished while episodes of aquatic conditions and sand inflow occurred on at least three occasions (at 4660, 3905 and 3130 cal. yr BP). The increase in water flow and the introduction of more medium to fine sand into the peatland could be linked to slope movements and the long-distance runout of debris flow that we observed in the field. Given these factors, conditions at the study site remained wet from the earliest phases until the present. Unlike the subarctic permafrost peatlands in northern Quebec, permafrost did not become established at the study site.

AB The cupolas of the spring-fed fens at Bobolice and Ogartowo (West Pomerania, Northern Poland) are composed of alternating peat and calcareous tufa layers. The geology of those two fens, together with the geochemistry of their deposits and radiocarbon dating results, made it possible: (1) to determine the source of water and mineral matter, and (2) to reconstruct the main stages in their development. The distinguished five main stages of development of the fens (four at Ogartowo) reflected varying depositional environments resulting, among other things, from the proportion of groundwater supply and its physico-chemical properties. On the basis of principal components analysis, the sources supplying elements of the peat-tufa rhythmite were found to be chemical denudation and sedentation of peat deposits, while mechanical denudation and atmospheric supply were considerably less important. The geochemistry of deposits was also influenced by local conditions of the geochemical environment, such as its pH, redox potential, CO2 content in water, and the occurrence of organic matter.

AB A geochemical approach using stable oxygen isotopes was used to understand streamflow generation processes in the highly peaty catchment of the Rokytka Brook in the headwaters of the Vltava River, Czech Republic. The contribution of water from peat bog areas to the total surface runoff was assessed using a hydrological time series, as well as geochemical, hydrochemical and isotope-hydrological approaches for unit hydrogram separation by means of anion deficiency. Using data from the hydrological year 2008, the role of an existing peat bog in the runoff formation dynamics of the Rokytka Brook catchment was determined, and the hydrological cycle was described and assessed using stable O-18/O-16 isotopes. The research findings strongly support the fact that peatland areas within the studied catchment do not significantly communicate hydraulically with surface streams, and their hydrological function in this region is insignificant.

AB Decomposition rates of peat and cellulose, and oxygen consumption rates were studied in three minerotrophic peat mires in Sasakami, central Japan. These mires had differences in topography, pedology and hydrology. Two dominant vegetation types in each mire, a Sphagnum palustre-S. cuspidatum community and a Rhynchospora fauriei community, were selected as the decomposition study sites. The objective of this study was to examine how the environmental and vegetational differences in mires correlate with the activity of decomposition. Decomposition rates of peat and the rates of cellulolysis were studied in the field for 6 months. Oxygen consumption rates were measured in the field using a closed chamber equipped with an oxygen electrode. In situ peat decomposition rates showed significant differences among the three mires, whereas in situ cellulolysis rates showed significant differences between communities. Peat mass loss rates positively correlated with the nitrogen and carbon concentration of the peat. Cellulolysis rates positively correlated with the range of water table fluctuation. Oxygen consumption rates showed significant negative correlation with the averaged and minimum water table depth, and positive correlation with the range of water table fluctuation. There was a significant positive correlation between cellulolysis rates and oxygen consumption rates. These are useful parameters for evaluating how the decomposition activity in soil depends on the vegetation types and water conditions. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB Here we examine the arrangement of plant species across an oligotrophic bog/poor fen peatland complex in the North American boreal plain and the relationships of these species to their physical and chemical environment. A semi-uniform spatial sampling approach was utilized to describe the species assemblages, pore-water chemistry and physical condition of 100 plots throughout a single peatland complex. Regardless of sharing the same ground cover of Sphagnum mosses, the remaining species separated into four distinct assemblages, each with unique indicators. These species groups along with associated chemical and physical factors are organized into four ecosites: bog, margin (edge) and two poor fen ecosites. The plant assemblages of this peatland have a complex relationship with numerous gradients, both physical and chemical, including depth to water table, shade, pH, nutrient and base cation. Rather than being homogenous across the landscape, most environmental variables exhibit distinct spatial patterns and do so in relationship to the plant assemblages, forming spatially distinct ecosites across the complex. Base cation concentrations play a smaller role than previously thought in differentiating these ecosites, and in addition to shade and depth to water table, nitrogen in the form of dissolved organic nitrogen was highly related to the placement of these ecosites. Many significant chemical factors appear related to evaporative water loss within the peatland complex, and these chemical factors are used to differentiate the ecosites. However, the mediation of evaporative water loss is due largely to self-generated responses of the plant assemblages related to shade through plant morphology and peat acrotelm development related to depth to water table. We conclude that plant species and associated environmental gradients act together to form spatially distinct ecosites. The distribution of these ecosites within this large, environmentally complex peatland is largely controlled by differing self-generated responses along the hydrotopographical gradient of differential water loss.

AB This study explored the potential of optical and thermal satellite imagery to monitor temporal and spatial changes in the position of the water table depth (WTD) in the peat layer of northern bogs. We evaluated three different trapezoid models that are proposed in the literature for soil moisture monitoring in regions with mineral soils. Due to the tight capillary connection between water table and surface soil moisture, we hypothesized that the soil moisture indices retrieved from these models would be correlated with WTD measured in situ. Two trapezoid models were based on optical and thermal imagery, also known as Thermal-Optical TRApezoid Models (TOTRAM), and one was based on optical imagery alone, also known as the OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM). The models were applied to Landsat imagery from 2008 to 2019 and the derived soil moisture indices were compared with in-situ WTD from eight locations in two Estonian bogs. Our results show that only the OPTRAM index was significantly (p-value < 0.05) correlated in time with WTD (average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.41 and 0.37, for original and anomaly time series, respectively), while the two tested TOTRAM indices were not. The highest temporal correlation coefficients (up to 0.8) were observed for OPTRAM over treeless parts of the bogs. An assessment of the spatial correlation between soil moisture indices and WTD indicated that all three models did not capture the spatial variation in water table depth. Instead, the spatial patterns of the indices were primarily attributable to vegetation patterns.

AB Wildfire is the largest disturbance affecting peatland ecosystems and can typically result in the combustion of 2-3kgCm(-2) of near-surface peat. We hypothesized that organic soil burn severity, as well as the associated carbon emissions, varies significantly as a function of hydrogeological setting due to groundwater impacts on peat bulk density and moisture content. We measured depth of burn (DOB) in three peatlands located along a hydrogeological and topographic gradient in Alberta's Boreal Plains. Peatland margins across all hydrogeological settings burned significantly deeper (0.245 +/- 0.018m) than peatland middles (0.057 +/- 0.002m). Further, hydrogeological setting strongly impacted DOB. A bog with an ephemeral groundwater connection in a coarse-textured glaciofluvial outwash experienced the greatest DOB at its margins (0.514 +/- 0.018m) due to large water table fluctuations, while a low-lying oligotrophic groundwater flow-through bog in a coarse-textured glaciofluvial outwash experienced limited water table fluctuations and had the lowest margin burn severity (0.072 +/- 0.002m). In an expansive peatland in a lacustrine clay plain, DOB at the margins bordering an isolated domed bog portion (0.186 +/- 0.003m, range: 0.0-0.748m) was considerably greater than the DOB observed at fen margins with a longer groundwater flow path (<0.05m). Our research indicates that groundwater connectivity can have a dominant control on soil carbon combustion across and within hydrogeological settings. We suggest that hydrogeological setting be used to identify potential deep burning hotspots' on the landscape to increase the efficacy of wildfire management and mitigation strategies.

AB An extreme rich fen complex located in South Park. Colorado, is the most southern representative of this ecosystem type known in North America and the first described from the Southern Rocky Mountains. The fen is fed by ground water emerging from glacial outwash and has pH ranging from 7.6 to 8.3 and Ca2+ concentrations greater than 50 mg kg(-1). The very low precipitation - evapotranspiration ratio in South Park causes Na+ and Mg2+ salts to accumulate in some soils, forming sodic peats that support halophyte communities. Character species of this fen include Kobresia simpliciuscula, Trichophorum pumilum, Carer scirpoidea, Carer microglochin, Carer livida, Utricularia ochroleuca, Triglochin palustris, Triglochin maritima, Salix candida, Salix myrtillifolia, Salix serissima, Thalictrum alpinum, and Scorpidium scorpioides. A hierarchical classification of the vegetation is developed using numerical and table methods and includes 14 aquatic, peatland expanse, and salt flat communities. The most floristically similar fens occur in northern Ontario, northwestern Wyoming, and northern Montana.

AB Variation of plant species cover on a Sphagnum-dominated mire in the south-eastern Alps of Italy was assessed over a 10-year period in relation to depth to the water table, peat accumulation rate, and climate. Population dynamics of vascular species appeared to be primarily affected by the autogenic process of peat accumulation, which determined the lowering of water-table position at microhabitat scale. Increase of depth to the water table through peat accumulation resulted in increased cover of ericaceous shrubs at previously moister microhabitats. Conversely, graminoid species such as Eriophorum vaginatum, Trichophorum caespitosum, and Scheuchzeria palustris, being negatively affected by autogenic peat growth, were forced to shift their niche towards the wetter end of the water-table gradient. Carex limosa and Carex rostrata decreased their cover along the whole gradient in depth to the water table, likely due to multiple processes related to peat accumulation, competition with bryophytes, and a negative feedback due to increased litter deposition. Bryophytes, in particular Sphagnum mosses, appeared more sensitive to climatic conditions, with higher precipitation favouring faster-growing species. Accordingly, Sphagnum fallax and Sphagnum magellanicum increased their cover much more than Sphagnum capillifolium, whereas Polytrichum strictum showed the strongest decrease at sites where S. magellanicum cover increased most.

AB Peat specific yield (S-Y) is an important parameter involved in many peatland hydrological functions such as flood attenuation, baseflow contribution to rivers, and maintaining groundwater levels in surficial aquifers. However, general knowledge on peatland water storage capacity is still very limited, due in part to the technical difficulties related to in situ measurements. The objectives of this study were to quantify vertical S-Y variations of water tables in peatlands using the water table fluctuation (WTF) method and to better understand the factors controlling peatland water storage capacity. The method was tested in five ombrotrophic peatlands located in the St. Lawrence Lowlands (southern Quebec, Canada). In each peatland, water table wells were installed at three locations (up-gradient, mid-gradient, and down-gradient). Near each well, a 1-m long peat core (8 cm x 8 cm) was sampled, and subsamples were used to determine S-Y with standard gravitational drainage method. A larger peat sample (25 cm x 60 cm x 40 cm) was also collected in one peatland to estimate S-Y using a laboratory drainage method. In all sites, the mean water table depth ranged from 9 to 49 cm below the peat surface, with annual fluctuations varying between 15 and 29 cm for all locations. The WTF method produced similar results to the gravitational drainage experiments, with values ranging between 0.13 and 0.99 for the WTF method and between 0.01 and 0.95 for the gravitational drainage experiments. S-Y was found to rapidly decrease with depth within 20 cm, independently of the within-site location and the mean annual water table depth. Dominant factors explaining S-Y variations were identified using analysis of variance. The most important factor was peatland site, followed by peat depth and seasonality. Variations in storage capacity considering site and seasonality followed regional effective growing degree days and evapotranspiration patterns. This work provides new data on spatial variations of peatland water storage capacity using an easily implemented method that requires only water table measurements and precipitation data.

AB Peatlands are wetland ecosystems where net primary production exceeds organic matter decomposition. They are characterized by a near-surface water table controlled by a combination of internal and external processes, influenced by short-term meteorological and long-term climate variations among other factors. Site-specific conditions, such as peat hydrodynamic properties, surface vegetation patterns, and hydrogeological setting also substantially influence water table dynamics. The objective of this work was to characterize the influence of hydrogeological setting and meteorological conditions on water table depths (WTD) and on fluctuations therein in seven ombrotrophic peatlands in or near the St. Lawrence Lowlands (southern Quebec, Canada). Up-gradient, mid-gradient, and down-gradient locations were monitored in the seven peatlands, using dipwells with hourly WTD recordings. WTD was also monitored in the marginal minerotrophic zone found in three of the seven peatlands. Additionally, heads in the outflow (i.e., receiving diffused water from the peatland) and inflow (i.e., providing diffused water to the peatland) zones within the adjacent mineral deposits were monitored in seven and three peatlands respectively, using piezometers with hourly hydraulic head recordings. Hydraulic conductivities for the outflow zones ranged between 1.4*10(-7) and 8.5*10(-3) cm/s, whereas those of the inflow zones ranged between 5.6*10(-7) and 3.9*10(-6) cm/s. Evapotranspiration was shown to be the dominant factor controlling monthly cumulative water table decreases (MCD), while precipitation dominated the monthly cumulative water table increases (MCI). A strong correlation was found between mean peatland WTD and outflow zone hydraulic conductivity. Peatlands that were identified as being strongly connected with the adjacent mineral deposits in a diffuse underground outflow zone showed the greatest variations in water storage. This study highlights the importance of the connection between peatlands and adjacent mineral deposits in controlling WTD, as found for those located in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. The results show that water table fluctuations are strongly controlled by meteorological conditions, and that hydrogeological setting exerts a strong control on MCI and MCD. Moreover, this work shows that WTD in ombrotrophic peatlands is influenced by the hydraulic conductivity of the outflow zones, and confirms that aquifer - peatland connectivity influences peatland water storage variations, and therefore peatland vulnerability to disturbances in aquifer groundwater levels.

AB Treatment peatlands are water purification systems located on existing mires. They are commonly used to treat different types of waters, ranging from municipal wastewaters to mine effluent. This study evaluated the capacity of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based thermal infrared (TIR) imaging, color infrared imaging, and stable water isotopes as a combined method for monitoring the functioning of a treatment peatland purifying mine process effluent water under boreal conditions in northern Finland. The results showed that TIR was an efficient tool for pinpointing cold groundwater seepage points in the peatland area that were not otherwise visible. Color infrared imaging was used to define Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as an indicator of plant health in the treatment area. A NDVI map of the area, measured on a day representing the main growing season (summer, +12 degrees C day temperature), revealed areas with stressed coniferous trees. This was probably due to excess water in these areas, resulting from successful spread of the process effluent water to the treatment peatland. Stable water isotopes were able to spatially differentiate the treated process effluent water, surface waters, and groundwater in different parts of the treatment peatland. This first attempt at combining these methods in monitoring of treatment peatlands was promising, as the results obtained with different methods complemented each other. While they produce only a snapshot of prevailing conditions, all three methods, singly and in combination, could be valuable tools in treatment peatland management.

AB Questions: What are the long-term results of fen meadow restoration after topsoil removal on peatlands? What are the causes of slow fen-meadow vegetation recovery on peat soils after topsoil removal?
   Location: Drentsche Aa Nature Reserve (53 degrees 0049N, 6 degrees 3746E) in the northeast Netherlands, with extensive natural and partially restored fen meadows (ca. 10,000ha).
   Methods: Restoration measures consisted of removal of acidified and fertilized topsoil and improvement of local hydrology by blocking or removing drainage ditches. The effects of shallow (20cm) and deep (40cm) topsoil removal were compared. We monitored vegetation changes after restoration measures in permanent plots over a 13-yr period, and analysed changes in species composition over time with ordination techniques (multivariate analysis: PCA and RDA). Soil conditions over time were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA.
   Results: The vegetation and environment shifted over time in response to restoration. At first the vegetation stagnated in a species-poor phase for 5yr, but eventually fen-meadow species re-established. At the end of the observation period, after 14yr, the vegetation after both shallow and deep peat removal was similar. Soil acidification occurred immediately after topsoil removal (within the first 2-3yr) due to pyrite oxidation when the soil was exposed to air after site excavation and the peat was temporarily desiccated.
   Conclusions: We found poor re-establishment of fen-meadow vegetation and persistence of species-poor communities during the first 5yr after topsoil removal, probably resulting from internal soil acidification. After further rewetting, a rapid shift towards the target community composition was observed. The positive shift in development of fen-meadow vegetation probably occurred due to increased groundwater discharge after successful hydrological measures were applied. Appropriate hydrological conditions (strong discharge of groundwater) are important for the success of restoration of these fen meadows, especially if pyrite is present in shallow soil layers.

TI A simulation model of mire patterning - revisited
SO ECOGRAPHY

DT Article
ID DYNAMICS
AB The development of regular, oriented hummock-hollow or string-flark patterns in boreal peatlands can be explained by a simple spatially explicit model in which hummocks have a lower hydraulic conductivity than hollows and are more likely to occur at lower water levels. Revisiting a previously published model, the function used to simulate water flow is shown to be faulty. Nevertheless, the corrected model confirms the general conclusions of the original paper, showing the robustness of the approach.Five phases can be discerned in the development of the pattern. Once the hummock strings reach from left to right across the grid, there is an increase in the volume of water stored in the system. The number of hummocks and hollows differs substantially from what would be expected based on the mean water level, showing that their arrangement is more important than the actual number of hummocks.
   Parameter settings at which a pattern develops are sharply delineated, indicating there is a positive feedback mechanism that enhances initial patterning. Like in natural mire systems, the patterns anastomose and merge. In contrast to what is generally assumed for natural systems, the patterns show a distinct downward movement.

AB Drier conditions caused by drainage for infrastructure development, or associated with global climate warming, may test the resilience of carbon-rich northern peatlands. Feedbacks among biological and hydrological processes maintain the long-term stability of peatlands, but if hydrological thresholds are passed, these feedbacks may be weakened, causing a shift in ecosystem state and potentially large losses of carbon (C). To determine peatland response to hydrological change, we examined the structure (vegetation composition and hydrology) and biogeochemical function (carbon dioxide exchange) of a pristine bog and a bog subject to similar to 7 years localised drainage (caused by regional groundwater drawdown due to mine dewatering) in the Hudson Bay Lowland, Canada. Water tables at the drained bog were similar to 1mbelow the hummock surface at the time of study compared to similar to 0.3mat the pristine bog. For hummocks and intermediate microforms at the drained bog, plant production was significantly less than at the pristine bog, most likely due to small changes in vegetation structure (reduced Sphagnum cover and smaller shrub leaf:stem ratios) caused by deeper water tables and significantly reduced moisture content of surface peat. Despite these changes in vegetation and hydrology, net ecosystem production (NEP) remained positive (C sink) for these microforms at the drained bog. Dry pools with mostly bare peat at the drained bog had negative NEP (C source to atmosphere), in stark contrast to Sphagnum- and sedge-dominated pools at the pristine bog with small but positive NEP. Our study shows that dry pools now occupy an unstable state, but the hydrological thresholds for a shift in ecosystem state have not yet been reached for hummocks and intermediate microforms at the drained bog. However, weak or no relationships between water table depth, peat surface moisture content, and plant production for these microforms at the drained bog, suggest that drainage has weakened the hydrological feedbacks regulating peat production, causing peat accumulation to slow. If drier conditions prevail, this reduced resilience increases the potential for a shift in ecosystem state and raises the risk of large C loss due to continued decomposition of deeper peat in oxic conditions, and wildfire.

AB Peatlands long have been considered to preserve the record of atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic contaminants such as Pb.  In the past two decades, Pb-210 hs been widely used to date recent strata of peat and to calculate accumulation rates.  The assumption that Pb and Pb-210 are immobile and not subject to diagenesis in peat has been questioned but not rigorously tested.  We attempted to determine if Pb is mobile in peatlands and Pb profiles are altered by diagenic processes by constructing a mass balance for Pb about a small peatland, by comparing inventories, concentrations, and accumulation rates of Pb and Pb-210 in peatlands across northeastern North America, and by examining the relationship between concentrations of Pb in bog waters and peat in numerous sites.  Our results clearly demonstrate that Pb and Pb-210 are mobilized by the organic-rich waters of peatlands.  Profiles of Pb and Pb-210 at depths below the water table do not preserve the record of atmospheric deposition, and inventories fo Pb and Pb-210 are depleted in peatland hollows.  Concentrations of Pb in bog waters are regulated by the concentration of Pb in the peat and the concentration of dissolved organic carbon.  The mass balance for one bog indicated that over the specific three-year period of study more than 30% of inputs of Pb were not retained within the peat.  As a result of this mobility, dates based on Pb-210 can be biased and inaccurate by as much as 30 years.  Dates based on Pb-210 should be verified by other techniques, especially when the inventory of Pb-210 is less than that expected from local rates of deposition.

AB An archaeological dig near Beverley, East Yorkshire, UK, revealed humified peat enclosing conical and cylindrical sand bodies ('sand cones'), which contained Romano-British greyware. Such sand cones have not been previously described in the literature. Below the peat, upper and lower diamict units (previously classified as Holocene alluvium) were reclassified as late Devensian lodgement till and pre-late Devensian chalky head (gelifluction deposits) respectively. Enigmatic buried timbers, dated dendrochronologically to 5840 BP, were found partially buried within the till. Micromorphological evidence shows that the peat is autochthonous. The sand cones are remains of former spring orifices, which served as foci for groundwater discharge from the regional East Yorkshire chalk aquifer (which underlies the chalk-head deposits in hydraulic continuity). As a corollary, it is suggested that the buried timbers subsided into the till penecontemporaneously with the death of the tree, when an early period of vigorous groundwater discharge led to the temporary establishment of quicksand conditions. Feat accumulation and humification were intimately linked to variations in spring flows. Radiocarbon dates help to relate these variations to regional palaeohydrogeology, in particular to Holocene water-table fluctuations, which reflect changes in recharge rates (a function of climatic change) and sea level.

AB Multiple proxies from a 319-cm peat core collected from the Hudson Bay Lowlands, northern Ontario, Canada were analyzed to determine how carbon accumulation has varied as a function of paleohydrology and paleoclimate. Testate amoeba assemblages, analysis of peat composition and humification, and a pollen record from a nearby lake suggest that isostatic rebound and climate may have influenced peatland growth and carbon dynamics over the past 6700 cal yr BP. Long-term apparent rates of carbon accumulation ranged between 8.1 and 36.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (average = 18.9 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The highest carbon accumulation estimates were recorded prior to 5400 cal yr BP when a fen existed at this site, however following the fen-to-bog transition carbon accumulation stabilized. Carbon accumulation remained relatively constant through the Neoglacial period after 2400 cal yr BP when pollen-based paleoclimate reconstructions from a nearby lake (McAndrews et al., 1982) and reconstructions of the depth to the water table derived from testate amoeba data suggest a wetter climate. More carbon accumulated per unit time between 1000 and 600 cal yr BP, coinciding in part with the Medieval Climate Anomaly. (c) 2012 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Reclaiming peatland ecosystems is challenging our understanding of how to rebuild functioning landscapes. Assisted succession may provide a practical approach to guide the reestablishment of peatlands in denuded landscapes. In Alberta, the majority of peatlands began as fens during the paludification process. This research focuses on creating fen initiation conditions to establish fen moss species on mineral sediment as an approach for peatland reclamation in the oil sands region. In a field mesocosm experiment, we evaluated the establishment of five common fen mosses (Drepanocladus aduncus, Ptychostomum (Bryum) pseudotriquetrum, Campylium stellatum, Tomentypnum nitens and Aulacomnium palustre) introduced in equal proportions to clay loam. To determine the optimal hydrologic conditions for the establishment of each species, we tested four water levels (0, -10, -20 and -30cm). We created vegetation types similar to those identified at the peat-mineral interface in peat profiles to determine the effect of herbaceous plant, low shrub and wood-strand mulch cover treatments on moss establishment. Three seasons after introduction, total moss cover averaged 40% and was greatest under all cover treatments and at the 0cm water level. Total moss biomass averaged 955gm(-2) in moss introduction mesocosms and was greatest under low shrubs and herbaceous plants and at the 0 and -30cm water levels. Fen moss species distribution was significantly influenced by water-table depth. Drepanocladus aduncus and Ptychostomum pseudotriquetrum were most common at 0cm and Aulacomnium palustre and Tomentypnum nitens at -30cm. In this approach, we created vegetation types similar to those found on mineral sediments at the base of Alberta peat cores and successfully established distinct fen moss communities along a water-table gradient and under shade cover. Introducing a suite of fen moss species that inhabit a range of hydrologic niches under low shrubs or herbaceous plants improves moss establishment.Synthesis and applications. Our research shows that it is possible to create fen initiation conditions on clay loam sediment by introducing foundation moss and vascular plant species at optimal water levels. Restoring the community structure and biomass accumulation that occurs in the initial stages of fen development appears to be a suitable target for peatland reclamation. These methods introduce a practical strategy to reclaim peatlands in the heavily impacted oil sands region of Alberta.

AB Cutover bogs do not return to functional peatland ecosystems after abandonment because re-establishment of peat-forming mosses is poor. This paper presents a conceptual model of bog disturbance caused by peat harvesting (1942-1972), and the hydrological evolution that occurred after abandonment (1973-1998). Two adjacent bogs of similar size and origin, one harvested and the other essentially undisturbed, provide the basis for understanding what changes occurred. The model is based on historical trends evident from previous surveys of land-use, boa ecology and resource mapping; and from recent hydrological and ecological data that characterize the current condition. Water balance data and historical information suggest that runoff increased and evapotranspiration decreased following drainage, but tended towards pre-disturbance levels following abandonment, as vegetation recolonized the surface and drainage became less efficient over time. Dewatering of soil pores after drainage caused shrinkage and oxidation of the peat and surface subsidence of approximately 80 cm over 57 years. Comparisons with a nearby natural bog suggest that bulk density in the upper 50 cm of cutover peat increased from 0.07 to 0.13 g cm(-3), specific yield declined from 0,14 to 0.07, water table fluctuations were 67% greater, and mean saturated hydraulic conductivity declined from 4.1 x 10(-5) to 1.3 x 10(-5) cm s(-1). More than 25 years after abandonment, Sphagnum mosses were distributed over broad areas but covered less than 15% of the surface. Areas with 'good' Sphagnum regeneration (>10% cover) were strongly correlated with high water tables (mean -22 cm), especially in zones of seasonal groundwater discharge, artefacts of the extraction history. Forest cover expanded from 5 to 20% of the study area following abandonment. The effect of forest growth (transpiration and interception) and drainage on lowering water levels eventually will be countered by slower water movement through the increasingly dense soil, and by natural ditch deterioration. However, without management intervention, full re-establishment of natural hydrological functions will take a very long time. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB One important need in the context of peatland restoration is to gain knowledge of soil organic matter quality and current soil-forming process in degraded peatlands. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of long-term drainage on soil transformation processes. In autumn 2012, soil survey and sampling was carried out on five shallow peatlands in the Central Sudeten Mountains (Poland) which had been drained for forestry use in the late 1800s or early 1900s. Four organic soils (Histosols) and one organo-mineral soil (Histic Gleysol) were studied. The surface soil horizons were mainly transformed due to long-term forestry drainage. Increased aeration of these layers had enhanced their content of labile forms of carbon and they were undergoing secondary transformation. Soil transformation was more advanced in fen peatlands than in transitional mire or raised bogs. Only the fens exhibited characteristic evidence of the moorsh-forming process. Further drying of these soils will negatively affect their rewetting potential and significantly reduce the effective application of restoration treatments. In order to reduce organic matter transformation and loss from the investigated peatland areas, their drainage ditches should be blocked. Additionally, some trees should be removed from their central areas to reduce evapotranspiration.

AB The sloping flanks of peatlands are commonly patterned with non-random, contour-parallel stripes of distinct micro-habitats such as hummocks, lawns and hollows. Patterning seems to be governed by feedbacks among peatland hydrological processes, plant micro-succession, plant litter production and peat decomposition. An improved understanding of peatland patterning may provide important insights into broader aspects of the long-term development of peatlands and their likely response to future climate change.
   We recreated a cellular simulation model from the literature, as well as three subtle variants of the model, to explore the controls on peatland patterning. Our models each consist of three submodels, which simulate: peatland water tables in a gridded landscape, micro-habitat dynamics in response to water-table depths, and changes in peat hydraulic properties.
   We found that the strength and nature of simulated patterning was highly dependent on the degree to which water tables had reached a steady state in response to hydrological inputs. Contrary to previous studies, we found that under a true steady state the models predict largely unpatterned landscapes that cycle rapidly between contrasting dry and wet states, dominated by hummocks and hollows, respectively. Realistic patterning only developed when simulated water tables were still transient.
   Literal interpretation of the degree of hydrological transience required for patterning suggests that the model should be discarded; however, the transient water tables appear to have inadvertently replicated an ecological memory effect that may be important to peatland patterning. Recently buried peat layers may remain hydrologically active despite no longer reflecting current vegetation patterns, thereby highlighting the potential importance of three-dimensional structural complexity in peatlands to understanding the two-dimensional surface-patterning phenomenon.
   The models were highly sensitive to the assumed values of peat hydraulic properties, which we take to indicate that the models are missing an important negative feedback between peat decomposition and changes in peat hydraulic properties. Understanding peatland patterning likely requires the unification of cellular landscape models such as ours with cohort-based models of long-term peatland development.

TI Model prediction of the effects of changing phosphorus loads on the
   Everglades Protection Area
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
LA English

DE EAA; everglades; phosphorus transport; STA; stormwater treatment areas
AB The Everglades Phosphorus and Hydrology (EPH) model was developed to simulate water movement and phosphorus transport in the Everglades Protection Area which is comprised of the Everglades National Park (ENP) and surrounding wetlands known as the Water Conservation Areas (WCAs). Water flows from the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) through the WCAs into Everglades National Park (ENP). The model is designed to represent the system as a series of cells in which water flows from one cell to the next. The code allows for pumped inputs and pumped outputs of water as well as sorption and removal of phosphorus through peat accretion. Model application involved dividing the system into twenty cells representing different segments of the WCAs. Inputs to each cell consisted of water pumped from the EAA (where appropriate), flow from upgradient cells, and precipitation. Outputs included pumped outputs and flow out of each cell. Using data collected by the South Florida Water Management District, the model was calibrated by matching simulated and observed flows, water elevations, and phosphorus (P) concentrations for the period 1980-1988. The model was then validated for the 1988-1992 period using the same model parameters derived from the calibration process and comparing simulated and observed values. Reasonable agreement between simulated and observed values was attained for both the calibration and validation periods. The calibrated and validated model was used to simulate the impacts on annual average total P concentrations in each cell resulting from the implementation of the management plan mandated by the Everglades Forever Act. This plan calls for the construction of six Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) to treat discharges from the EAA, hydrologic modifications of the system to promote sheet flow, and the implementation of Best Management Practices to reduce P runoff from individual farms. In addition, the model was used to evaluate the impact of not building one of the STAs (STA 3/4), and sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the effects of changing STA outlet P concentrations throughout the system. Model results indicate that phosphorus concentration reductions will occur in areas near EAA discharges in response to reductions in input P concentrations. However these measures will have little impact on phosphorus concentrations for 85% of the area of the WCAs and on the water entering Everglades National Park. The scenario analyses also indicate that phosphorus concentrations throughout most of the WCAs are similar with or without the construction of STA-3/4.

AB Transfer functions are now commonly used to reconstruct past environmental variability from palaeoecological data. However, such approaches need to be critically appraised. Testate amoeba-based transfer functions are an established method for the quantitative reconstruction of past water-table variations in peatlands, and have been applied to research questions in palaeoclimatology, peatland ecohydrology and archaeology. We analysed automatically-logged peatland water-table data from dipwells located in England, Wales and Finland and a suite of three year, one year and summer water-table statistics were Calculated from each location. Surface moss samples were extracted from beside each dipwell and the testate amoebae community composition was determined. Two published transfer functions were applied to the testate-amoeba data for prediction of water-table depth (England and Europe). Our results show that estimated water-table depths based on the testate amoeba community reflect directional changes, but that they are poor representations of the real mean or median water-table magnitudes for the study sites. We suggest that although testate amoeba-based reconstructions can be used to identify past shifts in peat hydrology, they cannot currently be used to establish precise hydrological baselines such as those needed to inform management and restoration of peatlands. One approach to avoid confusion with contemporary water-table determinations is to use residuals or standardised values for peatland water-table reconstructions. We contend that our test of transfer functions against independent instrumental data sets may be more powerful than relying on statistical testing alone. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There are still large uncertainties in peatland methane flux dynamics and insufficient understanding of how biogeochemical processes scale to ecosystems. New Zealand bogs differ from Northern Hemisphere ombrotrophic systems in climatic setting, hydrology, and dominant vegetation, offering an opportunity to evaluate our knowledge of peatland methane biogeochemistry gained primarily from northern bogs and fens. We report eddy covariance methane fluxes from a raised bog in New Zealand over 2.5years. Annual total methane flux in 2012 was 29.1gCH(4)m(-2)yr(-1), whereas during a year with a severe drought (2013) it was 20.6gCH(4)m(-2)yr(-1), both high compared to Northern Hemisphere bogs and fens. Drier conditions led to a decrease in fluxes from similar to 100mgCH(4)m(-2)d(-1) to similar to 20mgCH(4)m(-2)d(-1), and subsequent slow recovery of flux after postdrought water table rise. Water table depth regulated the temperature sensitivity of methane fluxes, and this sensitivity was greatest when the water table was within 100mm of the surface, corresponding to the shallow rooting zone of the dominant vegetation. A correlation between daytime CO2 uptake and methane fluxes emerged during times with shallow water tables, suggesting that controls on methane production were critical in determining fluxes, more so than oxidation. Water table recession through this shallow zone led to increasing methane fluxes, whereas changes in temperature during these periods were not correlated. Models of methane fluxes should consider drought-induced lags in seasonal flux recovery that depend on drought characteristics and location of the critical zone for methane production.

AB The ombrotrophic peat bogs of Tierra del Fuego are located within the southern westerly wind belt (SWWB), which dominates climate variability in this region. We have reconstructed late-Holocene water-table depths from three peat bogs and aimed to relate these records to shifts in regional climate. Water-table depths were quantified by the analysis of testate amoeba assemblages, and a regional transfer function was used to infer past water-table depths. During the last 2000 years, testate amoeba assemblages have been relatively stable, with a dominance of Difflugia pulex and Difflugia pristis type, and an increase in Assulina muscorum and other Euglyphida at the top of each section. Multivariate analyses show that water-table depth remained the main environmental variable explaining assemblages along the TiA12 core, but reconstructions were not significant for the two other cores. In line with the low variability in assemblages, water tables were relatively stable during the last 2000 years. Slightly wetter conditions were found between similar to 1400 and 900 cal. BP and a pronounced recent dry shift was reconstructed in all of the three peat profiles. Considering the regional climatic context, this recent shift may have been forced by a decrease in precipitation and warmer conditions linked to an increase in the importance of the SWWB. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the influence of higher UV-B radiation resulting from the local degradation of the ozone layer since the late 1970s, which may have had an additional effect on the relative presence of A. muscorum in the southern Patagonian region.

AB Field and laboratory investigations were undertaken of the environment surrounding abandoned U mill tailings at Rayrock, Northwest Territories, Canada, to examine the extent of Ra-226 and U contamination. Samples of ground water, surface water, and unconsolidated geological material from the Rayrock area were collected for chemical and radiochemical analyses. Results indicated that the surface waters contained levels of Ra-226 as high as 20 Bq L-1, Pb-210 as high as 1.1 Bq L-1, and ground water U as high as 2800-mu-g L-1. Lower levels of Ra-226, Pb-210, and U, 3.6 Bq L-1, 0.5 Bq L-1, and 4-mu-g L-1, respectively, were found in a small lake adjacent to the tailings area. Analysis of tailings and soil in the immediate vicinity indicates that the radionuclides and U are mobilized and can move within the tailings. Some of the mobilized radionuclides will be bound by the surrounding peat. The remainder may move to Lake Alpha in ground water. Surface water flow also transports some contaminants both in the water of Alpha Creek and by washing tailings into Lake Alpha. The potential annual external and internal dose equivalents to a hypothetical resident were calculated based on exposure from the abandoned U mill tailings, drinking water, and fish caught in the lakes in the vicinity of the tailings. While Alpha Creek and Lake Alpha water showed evidence of contamination, the rest of the water system and the fish were at natural background levels of radioactivity.

AB Despite its ecological importance, little information is available regarding spatial and seasonal changes in the testate amoebae community in peat bogs. The objectives of this study were to examine the structure of communities and horizontal distribution of testate amoebae fauna, to improve the understanding of factors affecting the distribution of moss testate amoebae communities and to analyze the seasonal changes in testate amoebae communities in a Sphagnum-dominated peat bog (eastern Poland). A total of 45 testate amoebae species were identified in the samples. The highest species richness occurred in hollows dominated by Sphagnum angustifolium, much lower numbers of taxa were observed in hummocks dominated by Sphagnum magellanicum and Polytrichum. The Monte Carlo permutation test showed the significance of Ntot, temperature, pH, and the depth to the water table for the variability of testate amoebae in all microhabitats. Species found in spring samples were associated with the increased Ntot content. Species occurring in summer samples were associated with the increasing pH gradient and species developing in late spring and autumn preferred a greater depth to the water table.

AB After peat extraction cut-over surface usually consists of moderately to highly humified peat which undergoes secondary transformation due to severely disturbed water conditions. The study was carried out within a mountain bog (Polish Carpathian) located in Orava-Nowy Targ Basin, southern Poland. The objectives of the study was to determine physical, hydrophysical and chemical properties of the upper layer of soil on two post-extracted areas of different age and to identify correlations between hydrophysical parameters and re-vegetation pattern. Vegetation was analysed in two groups: bog forming (Sphagnum, others) and non-bog forming (true mosses, trees, others). Secondary transformation of peat was quantitatively described by water-holding capacity index W-1. It correlated with thickness of residual peat and a range of properties of cut-over peat (e.g. porosity, bulk density, soil moisture content, ash content). The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated the key importance of water table depth, residual peat thickness and hydrophysical conditions of the cut-over peat, especially water-holding capacity index W-1, soil moisture content and macropore volume on re-vegetation by typical bog species. Correlation of W-1 index with soil properties and Sphagnum occurrence indicates that it can be a useful indicator in evaluation of secondary transformation of cut-over bogs and therefore the potential for spontaneous regeneration of typical bog vegetation.

AB Large-scale changes in climate may have many unexpected effects on ecosystems, given the importance of climate as a control over almost all ecosystem attributes and their many internal feedbacks. In particular, the interactions among energy flux, plant dynamics, and soil carbon and nutrient cycling are poorly known. In this study, we examined biotic controls over soil temperature and evapotranspiration (ET) in a climate change experiment in two peatlands, a bog and a fen. Bogs are isolated from groundwater inputs (i.e., ombrogenous) and are acidic, whereas fens receive groundwater inputs (i.e., minerogenous) and are more alkaline. They also have many associated differences in soil chemistry, nutrient availability, and plant communities.
   We removed 27 intact peat monoliths each from a bog and a fen in northern Minnesota to construct a large mesocosm facility that allows for direct manipulation of climatic variables in a replicated experimental design. The treatment design was a fully crossed factorial with three infrared-loading treatments, three water table treatments, and two ecosystem types (bogs and fens), with three replicates of all treatment combinations. Heating was achieved with overhead infrared lamps, so soil temperature was a dependent variable.
   Increased infrared loading caused mean monthly soil temperature to increase by 1.6 degrees-4.1 degrees C at 15 cm depth during the growing season (May-October). The soil temperature response was strongly seasonal, with much greater effects during the growing season than during the winter. Within the growing season, heating caused greater increases in soil temperature in May-June in the bog plots and in May-June and September-October in the fen plots. Occasionally during the winter, increased infrared loading cooled the soil by up to 5.1 degrees C, probably due to melting of the insulating snow cover. Fen plots were on average 0.8 degrees-1.0 degrees C warmer than bog plots during the growing season, although bog plots had a steeper soil temperature gradient with depth. Water level had no effect on soil temperature.
   Annual ET was 12-23% greater in the bog plots than in the fen plots, at least partially explaining the cooler soil temperatures in the bog plots due to latent heat of evaporation. Additionally, warmer, wetter conditions increased ET. In the fen plots, ET was more sensitive to water table depth than in the bog plots. Differences in the composition and seasonality of the plant canopies accounted for much of the observed differences in ET between bog and fen mesocosms, and hence soil temperature. We present a conceptual model of how above- and belowground ecosystem processes control energy fluxes in northern peatlands and suggest that such controls represent a general phenomenon that should be incorporated into climate change models that include biotic feedbacks.

AB This study examined daily, seasonal, and interannual variations in CH4 emissions at a temperate peatland over a 5-year period. We measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange ( NEE), CH4 flux, water table depth, peat temperature, and meteorological parameters weekly from the summers ( 1 May to 31 August) of 2000 through 2004 at Sallie's Fen in southeastern New Hampshire, United States. Significant interannual differences, driven by high variability of large individual CH4 fluxes ( ranging from 8.7 to 3833.1 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) occurring in the late summer, corresponded with a decline in water table level and an increase in air and peat temperature. Monthly timescale yielded the strongest correlations between CH4 fluxes and peat and air temperature (r(2) = 0.78 and 0.74, respectively) and water table depth (WTD) (r(2) = 0.53). Compared to daily and seasonal timescales, the monthly timescale was the best timescale to predict CH4 fluxes using a stepwise multiple regression (r(2) = 0.81). Species composition affected relationships between CH4 fluxes and measures of plant productivity, with sedge collars showing the strongest relationships between CH4 flux, water table, and temperature. Air temperature was the only variable that was strongly correlated with CH4 flux at all timescales, while WTD had either a positive or negative correlation depending on timescale and vegetation type. The timescale dependence of controls on CH4 fluxes has important implications for modeling.

AB The potential for restoration of peatlands to deliver benefits beyond habitat restoration is poorly understood. There may be impacts on discharge water quality, peat erosion, flow rates and flood risk, and nutrient fluxes. This study aimed to assess the impact of drain blocking, as a form of peatland restoration, on an upland blanket bog, by measuring water chemistry and colour, and loss of both dissolved (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC). The restoration work was designed to permit the collection of a robust experimental dataset over a landscape scale, with data covering up to 3 years pre-restoration and up to 3 years post-restoration. An information theoretic approach to data analyses provided evidence of a recovery of water chemistry towards more 'natural' conditions, and showed strong declines in the production of water colour. Drain blocking led to increases in the E4:E6 ratio, and declines in specific absorbance, suggesting that DOC released from blocked drains consisted of lighter, less humic and less decomposed carbon. Whilst concentrations of DOC showed slight increases in drains and streams after blocking, instantaneous yields of both DOC and POC declined markedly in streams over the first year post-restoration. Attempts were made to estimate total annual fluvial organic carbon fluxes for the study site, and although errors around these estimates remain considerable, there is strong evidence of a large reduction in aquatic organic carbon flux from the peatland following drain-blocking. Potential mechanisms for the observed changes in water chemistry and organic carbon release are discussed, and we highlight the need for more detailed information, from more sites, to better understand the full impacts of peatland restoration on carbon storage and release.

AB Large expanses of herbaceous floating mat wetlands (FMW) bordered by slightly higher uplands with forest or scrub occur in the northwest corner of the Tanana Flats between the Alaska Range and the Tanana. River. Five major FMW systems, together with other outliers and extensions, are linear in shape and cover over 20 km(2). Nutrient-rich and circumneutral water flows slowly through these areas toward the northwest and through outlets to the Tanana River. The floating mat vegetation consists of tall emergent macrophytes; mosses, in particular Sphagnum spp., are conspicuously absent and shrubs are infrequent. Although species dominance shifts over short distances on the mat, four community types can be recognized: (1) Menyanthes trifoliata, (2) Carex aquatilis, (3) Typha latifolia, and (4) Calla palustris. Below the water surface, the mat extends to a depth of 0.5 to 1.0 m and consists of rhizomes and roots in a matrix of well-decomposed peat and water. The mat then either directly overlies unfrozen gray silts at a depth of 1 m, or more commonly, floats on a clear-water or loose peat zone above more consolidated peat lying on unfrozen silt at a depth of 1.5 to 2.5 m. No permafrost or frozen ground was detected in late August or late winter below these floating mats but it is ubiquitous on the bordering uplands, 0.5 to 2 m above the FMW. The topographic location, apparent absence of permafrost, water chemistry, and vegetation composition suggest that these areas are fens fed by groundwater sources flowing out of the Alaska Range. Permafrost degradation and lateral expansion of these FMW is indicated by slumped blocks of forest pear, dead trees, and open water moats along the upland margin. Although floating mats are frequently described in the literature as occupying the edge of northern ponds and lakes, the FMW described here do not and they appear to be unique because of their large extent, absence of mosses, physiographic position, and presumed origin.

AB The environmental controls on modern peatland testate amoebae (Protozoa: Rhizopoda) in the North of Ireland were investigated to assess the potential for Holocene palaeoclimate research within this region. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) revealed that hydrological factors (water table depth and moisture content) are the most important abiotic controls on organism distribution. A series of partial CCAs showed that water table depth explains 15.8% and moisture content explains 5.5% of the total variance. Monte-Carlo permutation tests showed that the results are highly significant (p < 0.002; p < 0.040 respectively). Transfer functions were generated for water table depth using weighted averaging tolerance downweighted (WA-Tol) regression and for moisture content using weighted averaging partial least squares regression (WA-PLS). The performance of the models was assessed using leave-one-out cross-validation (jacknifing). After removal of outlier samples, the improved transfer functions were found to perform well with an r (jack) (2) and root mean square error of prediction(jack) of 0.83, 4.99 cm for water table depth and 0.76, 4.60% for moisture content respectively. The water table transfer function was applied to a fossil peat sequence from this region and reconstruction errors were generated by 1,000 bootstrap cycles. The water table reconstruction was also carried out using an established pan-European transfer function and was found to be similar to that based on the North of Ireland dataset. This demonstrates the persistent and comparable control of hydrological variables on the distribution of testate amoebae taxa across Europe and implies that regional training sets can suffice as long as no-analogue situations are not encountered.

AB Minerotrophic sedge fens are common in sub-arctic regions and are a significant source of atmospheric methane (CH,), yet they have received less attention than other peatlands, such as boreal ombrotrophic bogs, which are smaller sources of CH4. At the process level, CH4 fluxes in sub-arctic systems are limited primarily by cold temperatures, and thus are sensitive to potential climate change. This study examined CH, dynamics in a temperate sedge-fen to determine controls on the spatial and temporal variability in CH4 fluxes and, therefore, how the biogeochemistry of CH4 in sedge-fen peatlands may respond to predicted changes in climate. We used flux chambers and laboratory peat incubations over a six to seven-year period (1994-2000) to study fluxes, pools, and potential production of CH4 in a peat-forming wetland in central New York State, USA. Results showed that precipitation (i.e., dry years and depth to water table) exerted an important control on annual and seasonal patterns of CH4 fluxes. Mean summer flux rates ranged from 2258 nmol m(-2) s(-1) in the wettest year to -934 nmol m(-2) s(-1) (net consumption) in the driest year. CH4 concentrations in the surface peat were as low as 0.01 mu atm and as high as 10 matm in the summer months depending on precipitation patterns. In contrast, CH4 concentrations were consistently two to three times greater in sub-surface than in surface peat, and pools persisted during dry years and were temporally less variable. Fluxes were only weakly associated with potential CH4 production rates, which showed little seasonal variation. In-vitro measurements of potential CH4 production did not sufficiently explain fluxes, suggesting a need for improved in-situ methods for measuring CH4 production. Site differences associated with different dominant vegetation had a significant effect on CH4 cycling in all years except the driest, suggesting sensitivity to vegetation changes. These results indicate that predicting responses of fen peatlands to environmental requires an improved understanding of the underlying microbial processes and mechanisms that control CH4 cycling.

AB Monitoring tools are needed to assess changes in peatland biotic communities and ecosystem functions in response to on-going climate and other environmental changes. Although the responses of soil organisms and plants to ecological gradients and perturbations do not always correlate, peatland monitoring is mainly based on vegetation surveys. Testate amoebae, a group of protists, are important contributors to carbon and nitrogen cycling in organic soils and are useful bioindicators in peatland ecology and paleoecology. There is however little comparative data on the value of testate amoebae, vascular plants and bryophytes as bioindicators of micro-environmental gradients in peatlands.
   We compared the relationships of testate amoebae, bryophytes, and vascular plants with soil temperature, water table depth, micro-habitats and the carbon and nitrogen content of Sphagnum mosses in four peatlands along a 1300 m altitudinal gradient in Switzerland. We used the full diversity of vascular plants and bryophyte but only a selection of ten easily identifiable testate amoeba morpho-taxa (i.e. species or species-complexes).
   Indirect and direct gradient ordinations, multiple factor analysis (MFA) and transfer function models for inferring water table depth showed that a selection of ten testate amoeba taxa are more powerful (% variance explained in RDA) and accurate (discrimination among habitats) indicators of local conditions (micro-habitat type, water table depth and Sphagnum C/N ratio) than the vegetation (vascular plants and bryophytes either individually or combined and considering the full diversity).
   Our study showed that a limited list of ten easily identifiable testate amoeba taxa have higher bioindication value than the full bryophytes and vascular plants. Furthermore, testate amoebae can be analyzed on samples collected at any season (accessibility allowing and if precise sampling sites are well marked) - a clear advantage for biomonitoring and can be used to infer past changes from the peat record at the same taxonomic resolution. This simple approach could therefore be very useful for biomonitoring of peatlands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In Chlebowo mire (Wielkopolska region), we investigated testate amoebae in relation to 10 environmental parameters in the semi-natural floating vegetation of flooded peat workings. The measured parameters included: depth to water table (DWT), ground-water pH, color, conductivity, PO4, NO3, NH4, SO4, Ca, and Mg. Detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to analyze relations between the composition of testate amoebae communities and those variables. In canonical correspondence analysis, DWT, pH, and Mg remained after forward-selection as the main factors characterizing the changes in testate amoebae communities along the moisture and nutrient gradients. Characteristic species of testate amoebae for the various stages of floating-mat development in the flooded peat workings were distinguished. Communities of testate amoebae along with present-day vegetation reflect the process of progressive acidification, driven mainly by Sphagnum fallax. We consider this as secondary succession, since preliminary investigations of peat stratigraphy revealed sedge peat below no more than 5-40 cm of Sphagnum peat in undisturbed parts of the mire. This study increases our understanding of relationships between testate amoebae and their habitat, which is valuable for palaeoenvironmental studies. A local transfer function was developed with the use of six models: partial least squares, maximum likelihood, modern analogue technique, weighted averaging, tolerance down-weighted averaging, and weighted averaging-partial least squares. The weighted averaging model performed the best for depth to water table (root mean square error of prediction RMSEP = 6.99) and pH (RMSEP = 0.8). Results will be used as part of a regional training set to improve palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of Sphagnum peatlands.

AB Resource extraction and transportation activities in subarctic Canada can result in the unintentional release of contaminants into the surrounding peatlands. In the event of a release, a thorough understanding of solute transport within the saturated zone is necessary to predict plume fate and the potential impacts on peatland ecosystems. To better characterize contaminant transport in these systems, approximately 13,000 L/day of sodium chloride tracer (200 mg/L) was released into a bog in the James Bay Lowland. The tracer was pumped into a fully penetrating well (1.5 m) between July 5 and August 18, 2015. Horizontal and vertical plume development was measured via in situ specific conductance and water table depth from an adaptive monitoring network. Over the spill period, the bulk of the plume travelled a lateral distance of 100 m in the direction of the slight regional groundwater and topographical slope. The plume shape was irregular and followed the hollows, indicating preferential flow paths due to the site microtopography. Saturated transport of the tracer occurred primarily at similar to 25 cm below ground surface (bgs), and at a discontinuous high hydraulic conductivity layer similar to 125 cm bgs due to a complex and heterogeneous vertical hydraulic conductivity profile. Plume measurement was confounded by a large amount of precipitation (233 mm over the study period) that temporarily diluted the tracer in the highly conductive upper peat layer. Longitudinal solute advection can be approximated using local water table information (i.e., depth and gradient); microtopography; and meteorological conditions. Vertical distribution of solute within the peat profile is far more complex due to the heterogeneous subsurface; characterization would be aided by a detailed understanding of the site-specific peat profile; the degree of decomposition; and the type of contaminant (e.g., reactive/nonreactive). The results of this research highlight the difficulty of tracking a contaminant spill in bogs and provide a benchmark for the characterization of the short-term fate of a plume in these complex systems.

AB Warming and human activities have caused peatland degradation and water table drawdown, which greatly influence the physicochemical characteristics of soil at different depths. How water table drawdown affects soil physicochemical characteristics is not well understood for the Tibetan Plateau, especially the Zoige peatlands. This study measured variations in C/N ratio, ash content, delta C-13, and humification index (HI) as a function of water table drawdown and depth by sampling 100-cm soil columns from three sites with different water tables in the Zoige peatlands. C/N ratio decreased while ash content and HI increased with water table drawdown, suggesting greater decomposition of soil organic matter at sites with a lower water table. The response of soil physicochemical characteristics to water table drawdown varied with depth: in the layer above the water table, C/N ratio did not vary, ash content decreased and HI increased; in the layer below the water table, C/N ratio and HI decreased, while ash content increased. The physicochemical characteristics above the water table were influenced mainly by new carbon input, while the characteristics below the water table were influenced mainly by decomposition. The depth profile of C/N ratio, ash content and HI aligned well with peat formation and decomposition and may be indicators of peat degradation. delta C-13 did not vary with water table drawdown, depth, or decomposition process. These insights into the variation of soil physicochemical characteristics with depths and water table may help elucidate the processes behind peatland degradation.

AB Wetlands between, and within, dune-beach complexes along the south shore of Lake Michigan are strongly affected by ground water. The hydrogeology of the glacial drift aquifer system in a 26 km2 area was investigated to determine the effects of ground water on the hydrology and hydrochemistry of Cowles Bog and its adjacent wetlands. The investigation showed that ground water from intermediate- and regional-scale flow systems discharges to Cowles Bog from confined aquifers that underlie the wetland. These flow systems are recharged in moraines south of the dune-beach complexes.
   Water from the confined aquifers discharges into the surficial aquifer mainly by upward leakage through a buried till sheet that serves as the confining layer. However, the till sheet is breached below a raised peat mound in Cowles Bog, allowing direct upward discharge from the confined aquifer into the surficial sand, marl, and peat. The shallow ground and wetland water in the area influenced by this leakage is a calcium magnesium bicarbonate type, with low tritium concentrations consistent with mixing of older ground water and more recent precipitation Ground water and wetland water from surrounding areas are less mineralized and have higher tritium concentrations characteristic of precipitation in the late 1970s.
   The results of this study suggest that wetlands in complex hydrogeologic settings may be influenced by multiple ground-water flow systems that are affected by geomorphic features, stratigraphic discontinuities, and changes in sediment types. Discharge and recharge zones may both occur in the same wetland. Multidisciplinary studies incorporating hydrological, hydrochemical, geophysical, and sedimentological data are necessary to identify such complexities in wetland hydrology.

AB This study assessed the short-term impacts of ditch blocking on water table depth and vegetation community structure in a historically drained blanket bog. A chronosequence approach was used to compare vegetation near ditches blocked 5 years, 4 years and 1 year prior to the study with vegetation near unblocked ditches. Plots adjacent to and 3 m away from 70 ditches within an area of blanket bog were assessed for floristic composition, aeration depth using steel bars, and topography using LiDAR data. No changes in aeration depth or vegetation parameters were detected as a function of ditch blocking, time since blocking, or distance from the ditch, with the exception of non-Sphagnum bryophytes which had lower cover in quadrats adjacent to ditches that had been blocked for 5 years. Analysis of LiDAR data and the observed proximity of the water table to the peat surface led us to conclude that the subdued ecosystem responses to ditch-blocking were the result of historical peat subsidence within a 4-5 m zone either side of each ditch, which had effectively lowered the peat surface to the new, ditch influenced water table. We estimate that this process led to the loss of around 500,000 m(3) peat within the 38 km(2) study area following drainage, due to a combination of oxidation and compaction. Assuming that 50% of the volume loss was due to oxidation, this amounts to a carbon loss of 11,000 Mg C over this area, i.e. 3 Mg C ha(-1). The apparent 'self-rewetting' of blanket bogs in the decades following drainage has implications for their restoration as it suggests that there may not be large quantities of dry peat left to rewet, and that there is a risk of inundation (potentially leading to high methane emissions) along subsided ditch lines. Many peatland processes are likely to be maintained in drained blanket bog, including support of typical peatland vegetation, but infilling of lost peat and recovery of original C stocks are likely to take longer than is generally anticipated.

AB Central-European raised bogs, developed on mountain summits, are specific ecosystems of high conservation importance, but their history remains largely unknown. Pollen, macrofossils, testate amoebae and peat characteristics were analysed in a peat sequence of the Vozka bog (Hruby Jesenik Mountains, Eastern Sudetes, Czech Republic). Past water chemistry and water-table depths were reconstructed by transfer functions calibrated from recent testate amoeba data and long-term environmental averages. Peat initiation started in the middle Holocene (approximately 4200 BC) by the process of paludification, resembling the development of Atlantic blanket bogs. Around 100 BC the vegetation changed from Eriophorum vaginatum-poor fen to the ombrotrophic-bog vegetation similar to the recent situation. A hiatus in peat sequence was revealed between AD 1320 and 1954. It can be explained either by human activities, or by an extreme drought causing decomposition of previously accumulated peat. Local bog development was largely independent of landscape development inferred from pollen records. In the middle Holocene, mixed spruce-elm-hazel woodland was recorded close to the treeline. During 2400-800 BC a gradual transition to mixed spruce-fir woodlands with admixture of beech took place, and from approximately 800 BC spruce and fir became dominant. The major human impact started approximately AD 1230 and was connected with settlement and mining in the foothills.

AB Many of the peatlands that used to extend over large parts of Northern Europe have been reclaimed for agriculture. Human influence continues to have a major impact on the hydrology of those that remain, affecting river flow and groundwater levels. In order to understand this hydrology it is necessary to analyze and assess the groundwater and surface water system as a whole. The SIMGRO model was developed for such situations: it simulates groundwater flow in the saturated and unsaturated zones and also surface water flow. Being physically-based, it is suitable for application to situations with changing hydrological conditions and for practical aspects of water management in peatlands. This paper describes the application of the model to different hydrological situations in the Netherlands, Poland and Lithuania. The 3 cases deal with aspects of flooding, natural flow regime and flood storage in relation to suitable conditions for agriculture and nature. The calibration of the model for the cases was limited, but the simulation results show that the estimates of the discharges and groundwater levels were satisfactory, demonstrating that the model is an adequate tool for simulating the hydrological system, and has the potential to assess the impact of different measures. The Dutch case demonstrates that lowland basins where the groundwater has been lowered by extensive land drainage can be restored by restricting the inflow of surface water from the upper parts of the basin: peak flows are significantly reduced. For the Polish case, the damming of ditches in the valley of the Biebrza River could significantly improve the water regime in the peatlands of this floodplain. For the Lithuanian case, the flow regime for the Dovine River could be made more natural if sluice gates were replaced by overflow spill weirs. Understanding the hydrological system is crucial for sustainable land development and effective soil and nature conservation. The different measures simulated in the 3 cases illustrate SIMGRO's potential to simulate hydrological measures.

AB Current models and theories of the formation and maintenance of microtopography in ombrotrophic peatlands (bogs) assume autogenic feedbacks between vegetation composition, water table depth (WTD) and microtopography. A hypothesized outcome of autogenic feedbacks is a strong association among spatial variations in vegetation composition, WTD and microtopography. We tested and corroborated this hypothesis using fine spatial scale (<2x2m(2)) data from two 20 x 20 m(2) plots at Mer Bleue, a temperate bog. Furthermore, we partitioned the spatial variation of plant communities into portions explained by WTD as well as fine-scale and broad-scale spatial structures using distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps. We hypothesized that plant distributions are more strongly related to WTD than to microtopography and found that this hypothesis was supported in only one of the two sampled plots, suggesting that the feedbacks among WTD, vegetation and microtopography could be dependent on location within a bog. A plot closer to the centre (apex) of the bog showed stronger relationships among WTD-microtopography and vegetation than a plot closer to the margin. Our results support current models and theories of the development of bogs wherein plant communities, water table and microtopography are strongly associated because of underlying ecohydrological feedbacks but highlight that strength and direction of feedbacks may vary by location within a bog. Affirming the presence of these structural relationships and identifying variability in them is a key step towards better understanding peatland carbon cycling, especially in the context of increasing anthropogenic and natural disturbances to peatlands.

AB An understanding of soil moisture content variability is fundamental in hydrological studies of peat soils, whose preservation depend on water-related processes. Dehydration of fens and adapting them for agricultural production have contributed to the degradation of peat soils. The goal of this study was to determine how the critical soil moisture content (CSMC) and soil water repellency (SWR) affect soil moisture patterns in a degraded peat-muck soil profile. SWR was measured under laboratory conditions using the water drop penetration time test, and then the CSMC was assessed. An investigation of moisture patterns was based on soil moisture data collected over short distances in a grass-covered peat-muck soil profile on seven dates. Observed differences in moisture patterns demonstrate that the CSMC can be used for the prediction of preferential flow occurrences in peat-muck soils. Lower values of the CSMC and lower levels of SWR persistence in muck layers than in peat layers indicate that degradation of peat soils improves their wettability. The relatively low values of CSMC and the low shrinkage potential in the muck layer suggest that preferential water flow in the degraded organic soils can occur when heavy rains are preceded by long periods of summer drought.

AB In organic soils, hydraulic conductivity is related to the degree of decomposition and soil compression, which reduce the effective pore diameter and consequently restrict water flow. This study investigates how the size distribution and geometry of air-filled pores control the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of peat soils using high-resolution (45 mu m) three-dimensional (3D) X-ray computed tomography (CT) and digital image processing of four peat sub-samples from varying depths under a constant soil water pressure head. Pore structure and configuration in peat were found to be irregular, with volume and cross-sectional area showing fractal behaviour that suggests pores having smaller values of the fractal dimension in deeper, more decomposed peat, have higher tortuosity and lower connectivity, which influences hydraulic conductivity. The image analysis showed that the large reduction of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity with depth is essentially controlled by air-filled pore hydraulic radius, tortuosity, air-filled pore density and the fractal dimension due to degree of decomposition and compression of the organic matter. The comparisons between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity computed from the air-filled pore size and geometric distribution showed satisfactory agreement with direct measurements using the permeameter method. This understanding is important in characterizing peat properties and its heterogeneity for monitoring the progress of complex flow processes at the field scale in peatlands.

ID WATER; RESISTANT
AB Wettability is one of the most important peculiarities of soil and it directly influences their physical, mechanical, chemical, properties biological and their fertility. Soil water repellency can lead to the development of unstable wetting and preferential flow paths. Water flow and solute transport patterns are complex under such conditions. The existence of the water repellent layer can have negative influence on soil moisture content because it reduces the amount of water supplied from ground water level by capillary rise, infiltration from the soil surface and also for retention and therefore acts as a constraint in the restoration of drained peatlands by rewetting. That means that repellency can have significant influence on restoration, conservation and management of the peat resources. The paper presents the result of the spatial variability of soil moisture in a small area in a hydrophobic peat-muck profile located within Kuwasy drainage-subirrigation system at the Biebrza River Valley. Soil moisture variability study was carried out on an area of 1 m(2) and 0.5 depth in the two measurement periods. The measurements were made in two versions: the first after artificial irrigation (60 mm) and the second after an intense rain. In both of measuring periods the study area was divided into a regular grid of squares. Spatial variability of the investigated traits was evaluated using parameters of the theoretical variogram and cross variogram models. The variability of soil moisture in the profile after intense rainfall was higher than after irrigation. The maximum range of the spatial correlation (189 cm) soil moisture was observed in the alder peat layer for measurements made after irrigation. The observed variability is associated with high hydrophobicity of studied soil. The observed variability may be important in the assessment of current water resources of the soil profile. The relationship between water content and the surface of the sampling indicates that, following the increase of the sampling surface the dispersion of results gets smaller, and the distributions are symmetric. The relationship between the coefficient of variation CV and the surface sampling shows that most of the variability occurred in the top moorsh layer of soil tested (CV = 40%). To check the stationary conditions for soil moisture measurements, the analysis of the trend were made. Elimination of the trend also provided a normal distribution of residual moisture values. Semivariance and cross variance for residual moisture values were calculated, and then were leveled with spherical or linear model. From the presented data results that after irrigation as well as heavy rain falls there exists the relationship between the distribution of moisture muck individual layers (up to 30 cm) and can be described using a spherical model. The results show large spatial variability of the total variance of soil moisture and poor soil moisture spatial correlation between the different layers of the soil profile.

AB Hydrologic dynamics are examined across it range of spatial scales in a 78 km(2) wetland-dominated drainage basin in south central Ontario, Canada. The basin typically receives similar to 800 min of precipitation annually (similar to 20% as snowfall), although precipitation during the 1998 study year was 28% greater due to increased snowfall. Water table elevation, outlet stream discharge and local groundwater flow patterns were monitored in a representative interdrumlin headwater wetland sub-basin. A rising water table during snowmelt sustained surface saturation in the wetland and at the slope-wetland interface, and saturation overland flow generated the bulk of annual runoff, Despite considerable till thickness on the drumlin slopes, minor groundwater fluxes from slopes to the wetland could not maintain near-surface water tables. These fell below the ground surface shortly after snowmelt and led to cessation of stream flow. Vertical water movement in response to precipitation, evapotranspiration and recharge of deeper groundwater was more important than lateral groundwater fluxes in explaining the wetland's hydrologic behavior. Spatial and temporal dynamics of variable runoff source areas in the basin were examined based on stream flow response from 15 headwater wetland sub-basins. Peak basin stream flow resulted from delivery of sub-basins runoff to a spatially linked drainage network during spring snowmelt. However, sub-basins became decoupled front the basin Outlet as summer progressed, and their runoff during Significant Summer and fall storms entered ephemeral stream channels where most was lost to evaporation and infiltration or held in surface storage. Nevertheless, hydrologic connectivity was more protracted in 1998 than would be likely during a 'normal' precipitation year. Hydrologic processes in this drumlinized landscape are inconsistent with some aspects of the variable source area concept of stream flow generation, and caution should be used when extrapolating knowledge and models from well-integrated drainage networks to wetland-dominated basins such its that examined here.

AB The term fen has been variously used by peatland ecologists, ground-water hydrologists, and vegetation scientists. The common denominator among all types of fens is recognition of the importance of ground-water discharge, especially mineral-rich ground water, in determining fen hydrology, chemistry, and vegetation, in contrast to wetlands whose characteristics are determined primarily by precipitation or surface-water inputs. Thus, fens tend to occur where climate and hydrogeologic setting sustain flows to the plant-rooting zone of mineral-rich ground water. In the United States, these areas include the glaciated Midwest and Northeast, as well as portions of the Appalachian Mountains and mountainous West. Individually and collectively, fens are among the most floristically diverse of all wetland types, supporting a large number of rare and uncommon bryophytes and vascular plant species, as well as uncommon animals including mammals, reptiles, land snails, butterflies, skippers, and dragonflies. Several species listed under the federal Endangered Species Act inhabit or use fens. Fens also help maintain stream water quality through denitrification and phosphor-us sorption. Few estimates of loss and current extent exist, but where estimates are available, they indicate extensive loss, fragmentation, and degradation. Cultural eutrophication threatens the biological and functional integrity of remaining fens because, along with mineral-rich water, low availability of nitrogen and phosphorus controls many of their distinctive characteristics. Because they occur where ground water discharges to the surface, fens are isolated from neither ground water nor surface water. However, the majority of fens develop in headwater areas and could be defined as "isolated" for jurisdictional purposes because of their distance from navigable-in-fact waters. If so defined, the critical roles that fens play in maintaining biological diversity and stream water quality are at risk regarding federal jurisdiction over "isolated waters" because of the 2001 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the case of Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

AB The growth of hummock Sphagnum species in bogs depends on hydrological and climatic conditions, with different hummock morphologies being found across geographical regions. We investigated how plant shade and winter snow-load regulate the growth pattern and height of Sphagnum papillosum hummocks in a cool-temperate bog in Japan. Hummocks were subjected to four treatments across 2 years (1 hummock per treatment per year): no treatment (control), snow-load-free (S), vascular plant trimming (T), and snow-load-free and vascular plant trimming in combination (S&T). Further, the effects of vascular plant cover and snow -load on the vertical growth and height of hummocks were examined. Annual growth rates of S. papillosum were higher for the control (34-41 mm) than S&T treatment, and were intermediate for separate S and T treatments. In contrast to vascular plant-growing hummocks, vascular plant-trimmed hummocks showed a negative correlation between water-table depth (measured from the capitulum to the water-table) and Sphagnum growth. Hence, in summer, shading by vascular plants may prevent desiccation and facilitate the growth of Sphagnum. Snow-loaded hummocks were weighed down by 3-11 cm. After snowmelt, the shoots continued to grow within the water-table depth range that allowed growth. Hence, heavy winter snow-loads may depress the surfaces of hummocks closer to the water-table, which stimulates Sphagnum growth, resulting in the recovery of hummock height. Thus, the water stress caused by summer desiccation is critical in regulating the upper limit of hummock height in bogs subject to dry summer conditions and heavy winter snowfall.

AB The potential of soil ion exchange chemistry for predicting streamwater quality is evaluated using soil and streamwater chemical data from ten upland catchments in NE Scotland. The study catchments vary from those dominated by acid hill peats, alpine soils and podzols to those dominated by more base-rich soils, including cambisols and gleysols. Soil and streamwater chemical data combined with precipitation and parent material chemistry are also used to investigate sources and pathways of water movement.
   In all soils studied, Ca and Mg are the dominant exchangeable base cations in the surface soil horizons. In most soils, Na becomes increasingly important on the exchange complex with depth down the soil profile. Plots of the relative proportions of Na:Ca:Mg in streamwater show that, during periods of high discharge, streamwater chemistry tends to become relatively more Na-rich compared with Ca and Mg.
   Using triangular diagrams, streamwater chemistry can be described as a mixture of geochemically distinct packages of water derived from precipitation inputs, specific parent materials and key soil horizons, although spatially important soils within catchments may be relatively unimportant in controlling streamwater chemistry. Changes in streamwater chemistry at high flow can be explained by dilution of water derived from groundwater sources or the B/C horizon, either with laterally flowing water from the upper soil horizons, or with precipitation.
   In conclusion, changes in the relative proportions of Na:Ca:Mg in streamwater during storms suggest that precipitation chemistry may play a greater role than hitherto suggested in modifying solute chemistry during periods of high how.

AB Peatland complexes in the humid highlands of Hawai'i are vital refuges of biodiversity and freshwater resources. Hawaiian peat deposits are also rare repositories of terrestrial ecosystem archives located in an otherwise vast expanse of ocean. We investigated the potential for researching the paleohydrological history of Hawaiian montane peatlands on Kohala, Hawai'i Island through analyses of testate amoebae and Cladocera. Surface peat was collected from a variety of ecohydrological habitats (from water pools to hummocks) and analyzed for modern testate amoeba and cladoceran species relative abundance. We identified 54 morphotype taxa from 21 genera of testate amoebae, 4 taxa and genera of littoral Cladocera, and the common peat rotifer Habrotrocha angusticollis. Testate amoeba diversity and morphotype occurrence mirrored observations from many high-latitude peatland studies. Constrained and unconstrained ordinations support the hypothesis that surface moisture, measured as water-table depth, is an important control on the distribution of testate amoebae and Cladocera in Hawaiian peatlands. Transfer functions relying on weighted-averaging and modern analogs were developed to predict water-table depths from species relative abundance data, and these perform well under leave-one-site-out cross-validation: RMSEP = 9.75-10.3 cm, R-2 = 0.56-0.62. Including cladoceran abundance data in the calibration dataset produced modest model improvement: RMSEP = 1-8% and R-2 = 2-13%. A weighted-average partial-least-squares transfer function was applied to microfossil assemblages from a 0.5 m-long peat core with a Pb-210 decay chronology anchored by ten existing measurements of Pb-210 activity and a Bayesian statistical framework. Microfossils were well-preserved in the peat core. The water-table depth optima of an abundant down-core taxa, Hyalosphenia subflava, is not precisely constrained in the calibration data set, but estimates match those of other tropical studies. A reconstruction of water-table depth indicates dry early nineteenth-century conditions, wet conditions in the late 19th to early twentieth centuries, followed by progressive drying for much of the twentieth-century. Testate amoeba composition appears to have been sensitive to severe drought in recent decades. The results signal that assemblages of testate amoebae and Cladocera are useful proxies of Hawaiian peatland paleohydrology and should be considered alongside other archives of Hawaiian environmental history.

AB Light use efficiency (LUE) is a critical parameter to estimate the gross primary production (GPP) for terrestrial ecosystems from remotely sensed data. Only a few studies have estimated the LUE for boreal peatlands and none has calculated the LUE for a drained boreal peatland due to the limited availability of direct measurement of GPP and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), which are required to calculate the LUE. In this study, we used eddy covariance (EC) measurement of GPP and APAR at a drained peatland pasture and an adjacent boreal bog to calculate the LUE. The pasture had a significantly higher LUE (0.034 +/- 0.0109 mol mol(-1)) than the bog (0.028 +/- 0.098 mol mol(-1)). The LUE showed significant year-to-year variation at the pasture, but not at the bog. The LUE variation strongly correlated with air temperature and water table depth at both sites, but did not correlate well with vapor pressure deficit. This study indicates that agricultural drainage significantly alters the LUE of boreal peatlands and that the drained peatlands need to be considered separately in LUE-based models for northern peatlands. Moreover, a longer period of study is needed to fully understand the temporal dynamics of LUE in natural peatlands.

AB Local variability in decadal water-table changes on an ombrotrophic peatland was explored using testate amoebae analysis of near-surface peats in an Estonian raised bog. The distribution of testate amoebae assemblages was studied along the gradient from hummock to hollow in the upper 30-cm layer of peat. As expected, testate amoebae assemblages in different micro-ecotypes from hummock to hollow, even as close as 10 m apart, are distinctly different. Past water-table change was reconstructed by applying a transfer function based on modern samples from throughout Europe. Results show a decline in water level from the mid-late 20th century on Selisoo bog in all profiles from the different micro-ecotypes. However, the absolute water-table depths and amplitudes of fluctuations vary between reconstructions from different sampling micro-ecotypes. Cores were correlated using changes in non-mire pollen concentrations down-core, but it was not possible to correlate minor changes in water-table owing to non-contiguous sampling and variable accumulation rates. We conclude that different microtopes show the same decadal trends in relative water-table change but that the absolute magnitude of change may be more variable locally. It is important that reconstructed palaeohydrological changes in bogs consider changes in bog micro-ecotypes, and their variation over time, as this may alter the sensitivity of an individual record to drivers such as climate change. Comparison and compilation of data from parallel cores from different micro-ecotypes and/or different sites are likely to provide more robust reconstructions.

AB The chemical composition of peat cores sampled from nine drained peatland catchments overlying either black schist or felsic bedrock was studied in Finland. Black schist is enriched in heavy metals, sulphur and graphitic carbon, and therefore it is susceptible to weathering whereas felsic rock types in the study region are more resistant and contain only negligible amounts of heavy metals, sulphur and carbon. A total of nineteen cores down to the underlying regolith were taken and electrical conductivity was measured in the field. The peat cores were divided into 160 peat samples for the determination of chemical composition and acidity. As a result of weathering, diffusion into the ground water and adsorption by the peat, concentrations of As, Co, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Zn, and S, as well as electrical conductivity were expected to be greater in the peat overlying black schist than in peat overlying felsic rocks and this difference was assumed to be strong in the bottom layers and to weaken near the surface. The basal Carex (sedge) peat layer showed elevated concentrations of elements compared to the upper Sphagnum (moss) peat layers. The effect of peatland margins and flooding also exerts some influence on higher Cu, S and Fe concentrations. Ambient environmental features and conditions, such as slope and aspect affected peat chemistry in two catchments in particular. The first catchment showed high heavy metal and trace element contents associated with peat accumulation on sloping terrain, as ground water discharges at a spring on a rather steeply sloping surface. Another catchment with lower heavy metal and trace element contents represents peat accumulation in a well-leached watershed characterized by sandy deposits within a flat valley floor and an acidity that induced the development of a Sphagnum bog phase during the early stages of mire formation. In addition to the chemical concentration of underlying bedrock and soil, the factors affecting element concentrations in peat were the topography of the environment including paludification mode and species composition and the subsiding relations of the peatland and drainage. Special caution should be paid when excavation is carried out on sites containing high sulphide concentrations in bedrock, overburden or peat, e.g. ditch network maintenance or peat harvest can lead to enhanced leaching of acidity and heavy metals. Anthropogenic activities on sulphide rich peatlands pose an environmental risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Statistical Properties of Hydrographs in Minerotrophic Fens and Small
   Lakes in Mid-Latitude Quebec, Canada
SO CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL

AB Minerotrophic fens cover a large proportion of the land in mid-latitude Quebec. Since the last century, they have been subjected to an increase in mean water levels, which translates over a long period into an increase in the fraction of area covered by water-filled hollows, hypothetically slowly transforming them into shallow lakes as the hollows coalesce in larger ponds (aqualysis). This phenomenon progressively changes the hydrological reaction of aqualysed fens to rain events. Four sites (two fens and two shallow lakes), were monitored for rainfall, water table levels and surface runoff during two years in the La Grande River basin. Summer and fall hydrographs for rain generated events as well as relation between in situ water table and outlet surface runoff were compared, respectively via shape statistics and analyses of covariance. Depending on the hydrological property, results show some differences between sites, but not always systematically between fens and lakes. Fens had fewer runoff events than lakes but the events were of greater magnitude and duration. Four of the six hydrographs shape statistics (shape mean and variance, rising and falling slopes) were found to be significantly different between some sites, lakes (contrary to fens) being always in the same category. These results also indicate that the location and shape of individual ponds may play an important role in runoff generation. Concerning the relation between water table level and outlet runoff, regression slopes of fens were found to be steeper than those of lakes, especially in wet conditions. Climate change impact studies results suggest increases in annual runoff in this region in the future; this paper gives some insight about future hydrologic response of fens.

AB Two 50 - cm long peat cores from the Hani mire on the western slope of the Changbai Mountains, northeastern China, were collected for investigating physical, biological and geochemical processes of the peatland in response to recent climate change. The C-14 dating using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) on the peat cores provides "a nuclear bomb carbon curve" which is used for peat chronological construction. The sedimentation rate (SR) of Core S1 from a Sphagnum magenllanicum hummock in the Hani mire was about 0.98 cm/y and deposited from 1957-2008 CE, whereas the SR of Core S2 from S. palustre hummock (1 km apart from S1) was 1.59 cm/y and accumulated during 1976-2008. The discrepancy of the SRs may mainly be attributed to the different inorganic material supplies from surface runoff which affected growth of Sphagnum spp. at different sites, with lower rate corresponding to higher inorganic contents (higher Ti, Ca and Mg contents thus lower values of loss on ignition, LOI%). On the other hand, the two cores had similar values and variation trends in the pH, C/N, N and P contents, and dry bulk density (DBD), implying that the organic source and decomposition were similar under the same climatic conditions. The variations of TOC%, C/N and Pb content in the peat cores matched well with the 5-y running average of local annual precipitation record, with higher TOC% and C/N but lower Pb content corresponding to higher rainfall; and vice versa. These properties in the meso-oligotrophic peat sequences can reflect climatic changes. The recent rates of carbon accumulation (RERCA) for S1 and S2 calculated from the TOC%, DBD and SR were averaged 121.6 +/- 24.3 and 175.5 +/- 35.1 g/m(2)/y, respectively.

AB Peatlands are essential ecosystems in global carbon cycle. However, they have been drained for economic benefits for centuries; large peatland areas have turned from carbon storage ecosystems to the carbon emitters. Because of the slow spontaneous revegetation of abandoned extracted peatlands, there is urgent need for their active restoration, required also for mitigation of global climate change effects. The selection ofSphagnumspecies suitable for restoration may also have crucial effects to reach the restoration aims. In 2012, we began a restoration experiment in abandoned extracted peatland in central Estonia. We aimed to elucidate whetherSphagnumspecies, specific to natural North European bogs, have different growth characteristics under altered growth conditions in restored extracted peatland. We studied growth characteristics ofS. fuscum,S. medium, andS. rubellumat restoration sites with two different water table levels and in two natural bogs. We estimated total cover ofSphagnumcarpet and cover of three target species and measured shoot growth characteristics at each site. Linear models with correlated errors were used for temporal trends studies. Our results showed that studiedSphagnumspecies have different growth characteristics in restoration sites and that the main growth promoter is the water table depth (WTD). Results showed that greaterSphagnumcover (over 70%) can be achieved in wetter conditions with WTD higher than circa 20 cm. On wetter restoration sitesS. mediumandS. fuscumcould be recommended for restoration, whereasS. fuscumperform well also in drier sites.

AB Peatlands of the Western Boreal Plains are under stress from oil and gas development and associated infrastructure such as road construction and removal. An improved understanding of nutrient cycling and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange interactions in peatlands can assist in recommending best management practices to industry to minimize the ecohydrological disturbance footprint of road features. Peat nutrient (nitrogen, N, and phosphorus, P) supply, net mineralization, groundwater concentrations, and peatland-atmosphere CO2 exchange rates were quantified within a poor fen bisected by a semi-permanent road located in the Athabasca Oil Sands region of Alberta, Canada, over one growing season. Results demonstrate that the road impeded groundwater movement across the site; however, water table and moisture differences were minimal, likely due to the unusually wet season. No clear impacts of the road on nutrient dynamics were observed, but subtle differences in productivity and respiration resulted in significantly lower net CO2 sequestration (net ecosystem exchange) on the down-flow side of the road. Differences in vegetation composition between sides of the road were apparent and likely indicate longer-term moisture differences at the site. Elevated rates of productivity and respiration coincided with a seasonal change in the relative supplies of N and P (increased N:P ratios), suggesting that the relative availability of N versus P may be important to CO2 fluxes in Western Boreal Plains peatlands. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the need to capture interactions between hydrology, ecology and nutrient biogeochemistry when evaluating peatland carbon cycling response to road disturbances across this region.

AB Peat properties including porosity, dry bulk density (DBD), ash content (and their XRD and SEM), TOC, humification and plant macrofossil were measured in the well dated, young peat profiles of Jinchuan Mire in southeast Jilin of China. Base on the properties and depositional rates (Li et al., 2019) of JC1 (50-cm long) and JCA (92-cm long), carbon accumulation rates (RCAs) have been calculated for different periods and processes of peatland development over the past 1000 years have been described. The long term variations of the RCAs between Jinchuan Mire and nearby Baijianghe Mire (Xia et al., 2019) during the past 1000 years matched reasonably well, reflecting similar carbon accumulation rates under the same climatic control even though the plant species could be very different in the two mires. Enhanced detrital content caused by surface runoff due to heavy rains with decline of wood% in plant remains probably reflect wet climates; and vice versa. In comparisons with regional climatic records, we describe the development of Jinchuan Mire as follow: (1) relatively warm and wet climates between 1000 CE and 1150 CE reflected by dominant herb species (> 95%) with low wood% and no Sphagnum%, low DBD and detritus, and high TOC% and porosity. A dry climate occurred during 1150-1200 CE to lower the water table and enable growth of mosses in the mire. (2) Wet and cooling conditions during 1200-1370 CE supported well development of Sphagnum mosses and good development of the mire. (3) A climatic change from wet/cool to cold/dry between 1370 CE and 1440 CE caused disappear of Sphagnum mosses. (4) During the Little Ice Age (1440-1850 CE), cold and dry conditions led to poor peat development without Sphagnum mosses. (5) After 1850 CE, warm and wet conditions were in favor of aquatic herb growth. (6) Human impact caused anomaly peat accumulation with mainly tree species and detritus between 1950 and 1965. The peatland has been recovered from natural condition and development of Sphagnum mosses since 1965. Estimated RCAs in the hummock site and the lawn site are 320 gC/m(2)/y and 63 gC/m(2)/y, respectively during 1970-2010. Estimation of carbon accumulation over the entire peatland needs more work.

AB Background and aimsMicrobial communities are the primary drivers of organic matter decomposition in peatlands. However, limited knowledge is available regarding depth-dependent microbial community structure and function in East Asian peatlands, using cultivation independent approaches.MethodsWe investigated the vertical stratification of prokaryote and fungal communities in a moderately rich fen in northeast China (Hani) and a rich fen in southwest China (Riganqiao).ResultsFungal and prokaryotic operational taxonomic unit (OTU) composition exhibited strong site and/or depth responses. Prokaryotic OTUs exhibited the greatest alpha diversity at the mesotelm hot spot', whereas the predicted metagenomic metabolic functions did not align with the pattern of prokaryote alpha diversity. The large cover of shrubs contributed to a greater relative abundance of ericoid- and ecto-mycorrhizal fungi at Hani, whereas Riganqiao showed more arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Soil pH and water table depth were among the predominant abiotic factors associated with microbial community composition.ConclusionsProjected shifts in hydrology and/or vegetation with global change may cause substantial impacts on peatland microorganisms and thus the associated biogeochemistry. It is critical to better understand the mechanism of the discrepancy between microbial community structure and the functions at the mesotelm hot spot' when evaluating the ecosystem functions in peatlands.

AB We use stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes from a Kenai Peninsula, Alaska fen spanning the late-glacial and Holocene to enhance our understanding of peatland hydrology and nutrient cycling. We find that isotopic values for carbon and nitrogen are lighter in the late-glacial and early Holocene (-28 to -34 parts per thousand and 0 to -4 parts per thousand, respectively) than the remainder of the record. The light delta C-13 value corresponds with submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation during the late-glacial, suggesting high respired carbon input. Similarly, light delta N-15 values imply that nitrogen is derived from sediment and groundwater sources. Early Holocene delta(13) values ranging from -30 parts per thousand to -34 parts per thousand infer high recycled carbon uptake from methanogenesis, related to the warm climate and the wet swale environment. A shift to heavier delta N-15 and delta C-13 isotopic values similar to 9600 cal yr BP coincides with a change in the lithology to Sphagnum-dominated peat, indicative of peat accumulation above the water table. A shift to lighter values from 5500 to 4200 cal yr BP coincides with a period of glacial recession related to warmer conditions, whereas a subsequent period of heavier values is correlative with glacial advance culminating at 3000 cal yr BP, suggesting that the hydrology of this peatland is closely linked with the glacial meltwater. delta N-15 remains near 0 parts per thousand, relatively close to the atmospheric value of delta N-15, throughout the Holocene, suggesting that the fen has been supported by N-fixation. We propose that groundwater on the Kenai lowlands was fed by subglacial meltwater, and the warm early Holocene summers resulted in high glacial ablation and groundwater recharge, sustaining a high Swanson Fen water table. Cooler temperatures resulted in a decrease of glacial meltwater input at the close of the early Holocene. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dye tracing is a valuable method for studying the flow patterns in soils. However, limited information is available on water flow and solute transport pathways in dark-colored peat soils because the frequently used Brilliant Blue FCF dye does not visibly stain the soil. In this study, we were aiming at testing the suitability of TiO2 as a dye tracer for dark peat soils. The dye tracer experiments were conducted in differently degraded peat soils by applying a TiO2 suspension (average particle size 0.3 mu m; 10 g L-1) in a pulse of 40 mm. A Br solution was additionally applied as a comparison to evaluate the suitability of TiO2. The TiO2 suspension clearly marked the flow and transport pathways. The distribution of TiO2 in the soil profile, as analyzed from 5- by 5-cm grid cells, compared with the Br patterns. It was found that both tracers took the same preferential flow pathways, but the lateral spreading of Br was more pronounced, which was attributed to the limited access of TiO2 particles to the fine pore system. Both tracers showed a strong spatial correlation according to the cross-semivariance analysis, confirming the suitability of TiO2 as a dye tracer in peat soils.

AB During the restoration of degraded bogs and other peatlands, both habitat and functional recovery can be closely linked with nutrient cycling, which is reflected in pore- and surface-water chemistry. Several peatland restoration studies have shown that the time required for recovery of target conditions is slow (>10 years); for heavily-impacted, drained and afforested peatlands of northern Scotland, recovery time is unknown. We monitored pore- and surface-water chemistry across a chronosequence of formerly drained, afforested bog restoration sites spanning 0-17 years, using a space-for-time substitution, and compared them with open blanket bog control sites. Our aims were to measure rate of recovery towards bog conditions and to identify the best suite of water chemistry variables to indicate recovery.
   Our results show progress in recovery towards bog conditions over a 0-17 year period post-restoration. Elements scavenged by trees (Mg, Na, S) completely recovered within that period. Many water chemistry variables were affected by the restoration process itself, but recovered within 11 years, except ammonium (NH4+), Zn and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) which remained elevated (when compared to control bogs) 17 years post restoration. Other variables did not completely recover (water table depth (WTD), pH), exhibiting what we term "legacy" effects of drainage and afforestation. Excess N and a lowered WTD are likely to slow the recovery of bog vegetation including key bog plants such as Sphagnum mosses.
   Over 17 years, we measured near-complete recovery in the chemistry of surface-water and deep pore-water but limited progress in shallow pore-water. Our results suggest that at least >17 years are required for complete recovery of water chemistry to bog conditions. However, we expect that newer restoration methods including conifer harvesting (stem plus brash) and the blocking of plough furrows (to increase the WTD) are likely to accelerate the restoration process (albeit at greater cost); this should be evaluated in future studies. We conclude that monitoring pore- and surface-water chemistry is useful in terms of indicating recovery towards bog conditions and we recommend monitoring WTD, pH, conductivity, Ca, NH4+, phosphate (PO43-), K, DOC, Al and Zn as key variables.

AB Testate amoebae (Protozoa) living in Sphagnum peatlands are important environmental and paleoecological indicators. The distribution of these animals is closely related to soil moisture variables. This study examines the ecology of sphagnicolous testate amoebae near the southern limit of bogs in Europe. A total of 64 samples were collected for analysis of testate amoebae from six peatlands in the Jura region of Switzerland and France. Eleven site-specific ecological variables, six of which were soil-moisture related variables, were measured at each site. The data were subjected to weighted averaging, jack-knifing, cluster analysis, canonical correspondence analysis, and the indicator value method to model relationships between testate amoebae distributions and environmental variables. Testate amoebae abundance showed a direct relationship with pear pH and depth to water table. Strong relationships were with sites that had a water table less than 41 cm deep. In drier sites with water table depth greater than 41 cm, other factors such as soil porosity and water holding capacity were more important compared to the wetter sites. Though there was a strong relationship between restate amoebae faunas and soil moisture content and porosity, these two variables could not be confidently predicted. Testate amoebae in peatlands in this region appear to be sensitive to peat pH and water tables. Further work is needed to explore relationships between restate amoebae, soil moisture, and porosity.

AB Testate amoebae contribute significantly to belowground ecological processes like nutrient cycling, but a decline in their nutrient cycling functions in peatlands is expected due to global climate warming. We studied the dynamics of testate amoebae communities in relation to soil environmental variables in a permafrost peatland that experienced in situ experimental warming for a 7-yr period. Experimental warming reduced testate amoebae biomass by 41%. Redundancy analyses showed that testate amoebae community structure was correlated with water table depth and soil temperature (these explained 10% of the variance in community structure) and dissolved organic carbon (which explained 2.2% of the variance). Our results demonstrated that warming-induced changes to the water table depth affected the testate amoebae community in peatland, which could have consequences for the stability of the microbial food web and carbon cycling in peatland ecosystems.

AB This study documents changes in community and functional group across environmental gradients sensitive to climate warming in boreal permafrost peatlands and describes how future changes in temperature and precipitation may lead to changes in species composition and ecosystem properties. At the landscape scale, the presence of permafrost strongly influenced species composition. The position of permafrost thaw affected surface water pH and species composition. At local scales, a combination of water table depth and vegetation structure strongly controlled community composition. Permafrost plateau plots with high Picea mariana basal area were characterized by darker and drier understorey conditions, low cover of Sphagnum fuscum, Ledum groenlandicum, and lichen, and high cover of feather mosses. Aquatic collapse scar plots were dominated by aquaticSphagnum and Carex, whereas more xeric plots were dominated by hummock Sphagnum and ericaceous shrubs. Functional group responses indicated that changing environmental conditions with climate warming may have significant impacts on community composition and ecosystem processes. A decomposition example is presented to show how changes in species and functional group composition could have important implications for ecosystem-level processes like peat accumulation during climate warming.

AB Regular landscape patterning arises from spatially-dependent feedbacks, and can undergo catastrophic loss in response to changing landscape drivers. The central Everglades (Florida, USA) historically exhibited regular, linear, flow-parallel orientation of high-elevation sawgrass ridges and low-elevation sloughs that has degraded due to hydrologic modification. In this study, we use a meta-ecosystem approach to model a mechanism for the establishment, persistence, and loss of this landscape. The discharge competence (or self-organizing canal) hypothesis assumes non-linear relationships between peat accretion and water depth, and describes flow-dependent feedbacks of microtopography on water depth. Closed-form model solutions demonstrate that 1) this mechanism can produce spontaneous divergence of local elevation; 2) divergent and homogenous states can exhibit global bi-stability; and 3) feedbacks that produce divergence act anisotropically. Thus, discharge competence and non-linear peat accretion dynamics may explain the establishment, persistence, and loss of landscape pattern, even in the absence of other spatial feedbacks. Our model provides specific, testable predictions that may allow discrimination between the self-organizing canal hypotheses and competing explanations. The potential for global bi-stability suggested by our model suggests that hydrologic restoration may not re-initiate spontaneous pattern establishment, particularly where distinct soil elevation modes have been lost. As a result, we recommend that management efforts should prioritize maintenance of historic hydroperiods in areas of conserved pattern over restoration of hydrologic regimes in degraded regions. This study illustrates the value of simple meta-ecosystem models for investigation of spatial processes.

AB Long-term impacts of drier conditions on the hydrology of northern peatlands are poorly understood. We used long-term drainage near a historic drainage ditch, separating an area from the main peatland, as an analogue for long-term drying in a northern temperate bog. The objective was to identify the impact of drier conditions on ecohydrological processes and groundwater flow patterns in an area now forested and an area that maintained a bog-like character. Groundwater flow patterns alternated between mostly downward flow and occasionally upward flow in the bog area and were mostly upward-orientated in the forested area, which suggested that there the flow pattern had shifted from bog-to fen-like conditions. Flow patterns were in agreement with changes in post-drainage hydraulic conductivities, storage capacity of the peat and water table levels. Compared to the bog, hydraulic conductivities in the forested area were one to three orders of magnitude lower in the uppermost 0.75m of peat (paired t test, p < 0.05). Bulk density had increased and the water table level was lower and more strongly fluctuating in the forested area. Our findings suggest hydraulic gradients and flow patterns have changed due to increased evapotranspiration and interception with the emergence of a tree cover. The smaller size of the now-forested area relative to the remaining bog area appeared to be important for the hydrological change. With the main Mer Bleue bog as hinterland, enhanced runoff to the drainage channel had little effect on hydrologic and vegetation patterns. In the cut-off, smaller, now forested area pervasive changes in vegetation and hydrologic processes occurred. The difference in response to local drainage raises questions about tipping points with respect to the impact of drying on peatland ecosystems that need to be addressed in future research.

AB A meta-modelling approach has been adopted to link simulations of low and high water flows with simulations of suitable climate space for a selection of fen and bog species with differing drought and flood tolerance. The linked meta-models were used to examine the impacts of socio-economic and climate change scenarios on wetlands in two contrasting regions of the UK. The hydrological model shows that low and high flows are sensitive to climate change and to the regional distribution of abstractions and discharges. Where there are large changes in urbanisation, flows are more sensitive to socio-economic change. The changes in high flows have little impact on the species selected, but changes in low flows result in a number of areas becoming marginal or unsuitable due to dryness. At the regional scale, adaptation options appear to be limited and mostly involve, for surface water-influenced wetlands, increased water imports (either directly through increased non-consumptive water demand or indirectly through river augmentation), which may not be consistent with the socio-economic scenario or be feasible. This paper shows, therefore, that changes in hydrological regime are important for the future of wetlands and that these may depend as much on the future socio-economic situation as the projected changes in climate.

AB Peatlands play a fundamental role in climate regulation through their long-term accumulation of atmospheric carbon. Despite their resilience, peatlands are vulnerable to climate change. Remote sensing offers the opportunity to better understand these ecosystems at large spatial scales through time. In this study, we estimated water table depth from a 6-year time sequence of airborne shortwave infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral imagery. We found that the narrowband index NDWI1240 is a strong predictor of water table position. However, we illustrate the importance of considering peatland anisotropy on SWIR imagery from the summer months when the vascular plants are in full foliage, as not all illumination conditions are suitable for retrieving water table position. We also model net ecosystem exchange (NEE) from 10 years of Landsat TM5 imagery and from 4 years of Landsat OLI 8 imagery. Our results show the transferability of the model between imagery from sensors with similar spectral and radiometric properties such as Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2. NEE modeled from airborne hyperspectral imagery more closely correlated to eddy covariance tower measurements than did models based on satellite images. With fine spectral, spatial and radiometric resolutions, new generation satellite imagery and airborne hyperspectral imagery allow for monitoring the response of peatlands to both allogenic and autogenic factors.

AB Lowering of the water table and substantial drying are observed in peatlands worldwide. A significant drying of European peatlands in the last 200-300 years influenced the vegetation, lowered carbon storage potential in peatlands, and modified microbial diversity. Here, we reconstructed in high resolution hydrological changes, local and extra-local vegetation composition, and fire activity based on a peat core from a Sphagnum-dominated peatland located in a young glacial landscape in Central Eastern Europe, NE Poland. The last ca. 1500 years of history of the Jaczno bog has been supported by a dense accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon (C-14) dating resolution: 20 dates per 400 cm of the peat profile. We also investigated changes in the functional and morphological traits of testate amoebae as well as the functional diversity of testate amoeba communities over time. Our reconstruction showed a rare case of hydrological stability in the peatland over the late Holocene, and no dry shifts were recorded during the study period. Relatively stable hydrological conditions and undisturbed Sphagnum growth enabled the bog to maintain notably high peat accumulation rates. Although increasing human impact has been recorded in the last ca. 400 years, we did not reconstruct strong disturbances (e.g., vast deforestations, intensive grazing or farming, fires) influencing the site. Compared with other hydrological records from Europe, the Jaczno bog was one of the few bogs in Central and Eastern Europe that did not experience drying during the Little Ice Age. Moreover, the traits and functional diversity of testate amoebae did not show any critical turnover. In the last 70 years, human impact on the site decreased, and the area became afforested. Unlike most of the European peatlands, the Jaczno bog possesses high water tables up to the present time. Therefore, our data suggest that nature conservation practices, which target high water tables, are essential to maintain peatlands as a sink and not as a source of carbon in the future.

AB The efficiency with which riparian zones remove nitrate (NO3-) from contaminated ground water can vary with landscape setting. This study was conducted to determine the influence of flood plain geometry, Lithology, hydrologic now path, and nitrate transport on mechanisms of nitrate depletion of contaminated ground water. Patterns of NO3-N, chloride, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and delta(15)N-NO3- and delta(18)-NO3- values in combination with detailed piezometric head measurements were investigated in a river floodplain connected to a large upland sand aquifer in an agricultural region near Alliston, Ontario, Canada. Ground water discharging to the forested floodplain from the sand aquifer exhibited large spatial variability in NO3--N concentrations (10-50 mg/L), The transport and depletion of NO3- was strongly influenced by floodplain geometry and lithology, Little ground water flow occurred through the low-conductivity matrix of peat in the floodplain. Plumes of NO3--rich ground water passed beneath the riparian wetland peat and flowed laterally in a 2- to 4-m-thick zone of permeable sands across the floodplain to the river. Analyses of the distribution of the NO3--N concentrations, isotopes, and DOC within the floodplain indicate that denitrification occurred within the sand aquifer near the river where nitrate-rich ground water interacted with buried channel sediments and surface water recharged from peat to the deeper sands. This study shows that the depth of permeable riparian sediments, ground water now path, and the location of organic-rich subsurface deposits may be more important than the width of vegetated strips in influencing the ability of riparian zones to remove nitrate.

AB We studied the nitrogen retention capacity of six peatland buffer areas constructed in forested catchments in southern and central Finland. The buffers (0.1-4.9% of the total catchment area) were either undrained mires or drained peatlands rewetted 4-7 years before the present study. The N retention capacity was studied by adding ammonium nitrate (NH(4)NO(3)-N) solution into the inflow waters of the buffers once (one area) or twice (five areas) during a period of 4-6 years. Except for the first N addition in one area, the three largest buffer areas (relative size > 1%) retained the added inorganic N almost completely; their retention efficiencies during the year of addition were > 93% for both NO(3)-N and NH(4)-N. Two of the three small buffers (relative size < 0.25%) were also able to reduce inorganic N from the through-flow waters effectively; their retention capacities for inorganic nitrogen varied between 58 and 89%. However, one small buffer area had a retention capacity of only < 20%. The factors contributing to efficient N retention were hydrological load during N addition, relative size of the buffer area, and its length, i.e. the distance between the inflow and outflow points. If there was any release of the added N, it mostly occurred within a relatively short-time period (< 100 days) after the treatment. The buffer areas appeared to be efficient and long-term sinks for inorganic nitrogen because the release of N during the 2-4 years after N addition was minor.

AB The OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) is a physically-based approach for remote soil moisture estimation. OPTRAM is based on the response of short-wave infrared (SWIR) reflectance to vegetation water status, which in turn responds to changes of root-zone soil moisture. In peatlands, the latter is tightly coupled to water table depth (WTD). Therefore, in theory, the OPTRAM index might be a useful tool to monitor WTD dynamics in peatlands, although the sensitivity of OPTRAM index to WTD changes will likely depend on vegetation cover and related rooting depth. In this study, we aim at identifying those locations (further called 'best pixels') where the OPTRAM index is most representative of overall peatland WTD dynamics. In peatlands, the high saturated hydraulic conductivity of the upper layer largely synchronizes the temporal WTD fluctuations over several kilometers, i.e., even though the mean and amplitude of the WTD dynamics may vary in space. Therefore, it can be assumed that the WTD time series, either measured at a single location or simulated for a grid cell with the PEATland-specific adaptation of the NASA Catchment Land Surface Model (PEATCLSM), are representative of the overall peatland WTD dynamics. We took advantage of this concept to identify the 'best pixel' of all spatially distributed OPTRAM pixels within a peatland, as that pixel with the highest time series Pearson correlation (R) with WTD data accounting for temporal autocorrelation. The OPTRAM index was calculated based on various remotely sensed images, namely, Landsat, MODIS, and aggregated Landsat images at MODIS resolution for five northern peatlands with long-term WTD records, including both bogs and fens. The 'best pixels' were dominantly covered with mosses and graminoids with little or no shrub or trees. However, the performance of OPTRAM highly depended on the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed data. The Landsat-based OPTRAM index yielded the highest R values (mean of 0.7 across the 'best pixels' in five peatlands). Our study further indicates that, in the absence of historical in situ data, PEATCLSM can be used as an alternative to localize 'best pixels'. This finding enables the future applicability of OPTRAM to monitor WTD changes in peatlands on a global scale.

AB Wetlands are among the most important natural resources in the world, a human treasure house with many resources. According to the convention on wetlands, wetlands can be natural or artificial, permanent or temporary swamps, wet plains, peatlands, and water areas, which are water bodies with static, flowing, fresh water, brackish water, or salt water, including shallow water areas with a depth of no more than 6 m at low tide. This article mainly studies the coastal wetland of Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, by remote sensing, GIS, and GPS technology and cellular automata modeling. Based on the remote sensing images of 1992, 2000, and 2008, the cellular automata model of the Yancheng coastal wetland is established. Through the relevant data, this article analyzes the evolution process of wetland landscape pattern, which plays an important role in the prediction of wetland changes in Yancheng. Through this model, the landscape data in 2020 are predicted. Finally, this article puts forward some sustainable development measures, which can better protect the wetland resources of Yancheng, Jiangsu Province.

AB Between 1999 and 2002, thecamoebian assemblages were analyzed in one hundred samples collected from tributaries of the Upper Vltava River (Sumava Mts., Czech Republic, Middle Europe). The Sumava Mountains comprise the largest forest complex in Central Europe that is still preserved in a near natural condition. Diverse fresh-water environments (springs, wetlands, peat bogs, creeks, rivers and ponds) characterize the area.
   Thecamoebian tests were picked from dried 36-500 pin residues. In total, eighteen thecamoebian species were identified. The number of species per sample varies from one to thirteen, and the assemblages are characterized by dominance of Centropyxis orbicularis, C. aculeata, Pontigulasia compressa, Difflugia oblonga and Centropyxis arcula. A negative correlation (r = - 0.67) is notable between abundances of centropyxids and P. compressa. The negative correlation is caused by the different environmental conditions preferred by each taxon. Assemblages dominated by centropyxids originate mainly from standing water, whereas assemblages with common to abundant occurrences of P. compressa prefer running-water environments and substratum without coarse organic debris.
   Following a flood event in August 2002, thecamoebian assemblages were more diverse and abundant. While reworking of thecamoebian tests from different biotopes during flooding probably caused the increase in diversity, a boom in the population of Centropyxis orbicularis after the flood event confirmed the opportunistic character of this species.
   Boundary abundances of diagnostic species defined for flowing and standing waters in the forest area (= more than 20% of Pontigulasia compressa for flowing water and more than 50% of centropyxids for standing water) can be applied in interpretation of ancient environments. Similarly, changes in thecamoebian assemblages before and after the flood event can be used in paleoecology.

AB Proxies that use changes in the composition of ecological communities to reconstruct temporal changes in an environmental covariate are commonly used in paleoclimatology and paleolimnology. Existing methods, such as weighted averaging and modern analog technique, relate compositional data to the covariate in very simple ways, and different methods are seldom compared systematically. We present a new Bayesian model that better represents the underlying data and the complexity in the relationships between species' abundances and a paleoenvironmental covariate. Using testate amoeba-based reconstructions of water-table depth as a test case, we systematically compare new and existing models in a cross-validation experiment on a large training dataset from North America. We then apply the different models to a new 7500-year record of testate amoeba assemblages from Caribou Bog in Maine and compare the resulting water-table depth reconstructions. We find that Bayesian models represent an improvement over existing methods in three key ways: more complete use of the underlying compositional data, full and meaningful treatment of uncertainty, and clear paths toward methodological improvements. Furthermore, we highlight how developing and systematically comparing methods lead to an improved understanding of the proxy system. This paper focuses on testate amoebae and water-table depth, but the framework and ideas are widely applicable to other proxies based on compositional data.

AB Study region: This study was conducted in Northern Ontario, Canada, in the middle of the Hudson-James Bay. Lowland: one of the world's largest wetland complexes.
   Study focus: Northern latitudes are expected to be the most impacted by climate change in the next century and adding to this stressor are increased mineral exploration activities, such as the De Beers Victor Mine, a large open-pit diamond mine. Because of the extremely low relief and presence of marine sediments, horizontal runoff and vertical seepages losses are minimal. As a consequence of this aquifer dewatering must occur to keep the open-pit mine dry. What is unknown is how the aquifer dewatering would impact the water balance of a peatland-dominated watershed. This study examines 3 years of aquifer dewatering from 2009 to 2011.
   New hydrological insights: Deep seepage (groundwater recharge) varied with marine sediment thickness and represented a significant loss to the local system. Large downward fluxes were also measured in fen systems that are typically local discharge zones. Evaporation rates were also found to be lower in the bogs and fens and where impacted by lower water tables. When evaluating the water balance, with only 14.5% of the watershed impacted by the mine, the hydrological function of the entire watershed is more driven by seasonal climate variations than mine dewatering.

AB A number of hydrological, botanical, macro- and micro-climatological processes are involved in the formation of patterned peatlands. La Grande Tsa at 2336 m a.s.l. is probably the highest bog in the central Swiss Alps and is unique in its pattern. In two of five pools there is in the contact zone between the basal peat and the overlying gyttja an unconfonnity in the depth-age models based on radiocarbon dates. Palynostratigraphies of cores from a ridge and a pool confirm the occurrence of an unconformity in the contact zone. We conclude that deepening of the pools results from decomposition of peat. The fact that the dated unconformities in the two pools and the unconfonnity in the ridge-core all fall within the Bronze Age suggest they were caused by events external to the bog. We hypothesize that early transhumance resulted in anthropogenic lowering of the timberline, which resulted in a reduction in the leaf-area index and evapotranspiration, and in higher water levels and thus pool formation.

AB Peatlands are highly valued for their range of ecosystem services, including distinctive biodiversity, agricultural uses, recreational amenities, water provision, river flow regulation and their capacity to store carbon. There have been a range of estimates of carbon stored in peatlands in the United Kingdom, but uncertainties remain, in particular with regard to depth and bulk density of peat. In addition, very few studies consider the full profile with depth in carbon auditing. The importance of sub-peat soils within peatland carbon stores has been recognized, but remains poorly understood and is included rarely within peatland carbon audits. This study examines the importance of the carbon store based on a study of blanket peat on Dartmoor, UK, by estimating peat depths in a 4x1km survey area using ground penetrating radar (GPR), extraction of 43 cores across a range of peat depth, and estimation of carbon densities based on measures of loss-on-ignition and bulk density. Comparison of GPR estimates of peat depth with core depths shows excellent agreement, to provide the basis for a detailed understanding of the distribution of peat depths within the survey area. Carbon densities of the sub-peat soils are on average 78 and 53kgC/m(3) for the overlying blanket peat. There is considerable spatial variability in the estimates of total carbon from each core across the survey area, with values ranging between 56.5kgC/m(2) (1.01m total depth of peat and soil) and 524kgC/m(2) (6.63m total depth). Sub-peat soil carbon represents between 4 and 28 per cent (mean 13.5) of the total carbon stored, with greater values for shallower peat. The results indicate a significant and previously unaccounted store of carbon within blanket peat regions which should be included in future calculations of overall carbon storage. It is argued that this store needs to be considered in carbon audits.

AB The impact climate and land-use changes have on the hydrological conditions in peat bogs and lakes is often complex, but of great importance for the carbon budget and biodiversity in these ecosystems. Links and feed-backs between raised bog water table depth, lake level, net precipitation, hydrometeorological indices, and radial tree growth have been studied and identified in the Rekyva wetland complex, Lithuania. Moreover, several statistically significant correlations between raised bog water table depths, lake level, local river runoff, and tree growth were observed. The changes of raised bog water table, lake level, and tree growth show synchronous trends despite variations in the absolute values. Our results show decreasing water table in the Rekyva wetland complex over the last 100 years, especially in the middle of the 20th century. This study also shows a potential for reconstructing water table fluctuations in wetland complexes using multi-indicator approaches. Our observations and reconstruction show consistency with several regional studies and reconstructions of moisture variations in Baltic raised bogs, at least for periods without strong anthropogenic influences.

AB Monthly sampling of a mire outlet and two tributaries, one of them originating in the mire, on the Svartberget catchment in northern Sweden was performed during one year. The concentration of total organic carbon (TOC) in the three waters was fairly high (10-40 mg/l). Methylmercury (MeHg) was analysed in the original water sample (MeHg-whl) and in the humic fraction (MeHg-hum). The MeHg-hum increased with increasing concentration of humic substances (HS; measured as absorbance at 254 nm) in the water. A seasonal variation of the MeHg-hum/TOC ratio was superimposed on a negative relationship to the water flow, which indicates that the methylation is a slow process which results in a rapid drainage of the storage during periods of high flow. A minimum of the MeHg-whl/TOC ratio observed during the spring flood was followed by a slow increase during the rest of the year.

AB Peatlands abandoned after being exploited for horticultural materials can be characterized by soil-water deficits that challenge the establishment of appropriate plant species, thus rewetting is an important step to restoring them to naturally functioning ecosystems. A bog section of Bic-Saint-Fabien peatland near Rimouski, QC was vacuum-harvested for peat production and abandoned in 2000. Harvesting activity left topographic elevation differences across the harvested area, creating wetness gradients. In general, the site interior had more available water than peripheral regions. Bic-Saint-Fabien was cut down to minerotrophic sedge peat; therefore it was restored as a fen. Research for this study lasted four years, 2008-2011. A water budget was created for every year of study to determine the importance of different hydrological parameters at Bic-Saint-Fabien.
   The main loss of water was through evapotranspiration and the principal input was precipitation. The main difference in the water budget between study years was that pre-rewetting was climatologically wetter than post-rewetting. Despite more available water before rewetting, before-after-control-impact design ANOVA indicated the water table was significantly higher at the cutover area after rewetting. In 2011 a wetness gradient remained evident within the cutover section of the peatland; however the mean seasonal water table was close (within 20 cm) to the peat surface at all measured wells. An interior section of Bic-Saint-Fabien remained saturated for nearly all of 2011 and had mean seasonal water table of +2.4 cm, and volumetric soil moisture content and soil water pressure, measured 5 cm below the surface, of 86% and +4 mbar, respectively, compared to 15.4 cm, 67% and 103 mbar, respectively, at a nearby (similar to 100 m) peripheral section. Systematic differences in wetness across the site suggest that a uniform prescription for vegetation re-establishment in the rewetted section may not be appropriate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Wetlands continue to be under threat, and there is a major need for mapping and monitoring wetlands for better management and protection of these sensitive areas. Only a few studies have been published on wetland characterization using polarimetric synthetic aperture radars (SARs). The most successful results have been obtained using the phase difference between HH and VV polarizations, phi(HH) - phi(VV), which has shown promise for separating flooded wetland classes. Recently, we have introduced a new decomposition, the Touzi decomposition, which describes target scattering type in terms of a complex entity, the symmetric scattering type. Huynen's target helicity is used to assess the symmetric nature of target scattering. In this paper, the new complex-scattering-type parameters, the magnitude as and phase Phi(alpha s), are investigated for wetland characterization. The use of the dominant-scattering-type phase Phi(alpha s) makes it possible to discriminate shrub bogs from poor (sedge or shrub) fens. These two classes cannot be separated using phi(HH) - phi(VV), or the radiometric scattering information provided by alpha(s), the Cloude alpha, the entropy H, and the multipolarization HH-HV-VV channels. phi(alpha s), which cannot detect deep (45 cm below the peat surface) water flow in a bog, is more sensitive to the shallower (10-20-cm) fen beneath water, and this makes possible the separation of poor fens from shrub bogs. Phi(alpha s) also permits the discrimination of conifer-dominated treed bog from upland deciduous forest under leafy conditions. Target helicity information is exploited to introduce a new parameter, the target asymmetry. The latter is shown very promising for detection of forest changes between leafy and no-leaf conditions. The analysis of low-entropy marsh scattering showed that both the scattering-type magnitude and phase alpha(s) and Phi(alpha s), respectively, as well as the maximum polarization intensity of the dominant scattering m, are needed for a better understanding of marsh complex scattering mechanisms. The unique information provided by the new roll-invariant decomposition parameters are demonstrated using repeat-pass Convair-580 polarimetric C-band SAR data collected in June and October 1995 over the RAMSAR Mer Bleue wetland site near Ottawa (Canada).

AB In ombrotrophic peatlands, the moisture content of the acrotelm (vadoze zone) controls oxygen diffusion rates, redox state, and the turnover of organic matter. Thus, variably saturated flow processes determine whether peatlands act as sinks or sources of atmospheric carbon, and modelling these processes is crucial to assess effects of changed environmental conditions on the future development of these ecosystems. We show that the Richards equation can be used to accurately describe the moisture dynamics under evaporative conditions in variably saturated peat soil, encompassing the transition from the topmost living moss layer to the decomposed peat as part of the vadose zone. Soil hydraulic properties (SHP) were identified by inverse simulation of evaporation experiments on samples from the entire acrotelm. To obtain consistent descriptions of the observations, the traditional van GenuchtenMualem model was extended to account for non-capillary water storage and flow. We found that the SHP of the uppermost moss layer reflect a pore-size distribution (PSD) that combines three distinct pore systems of the Sphagnum moss. For deeper samples, acrotelm pedogenesis changes the shape of the SHP due to the collapse of inter-plant pores and an infill with smaller particles. This leads to gradually more homogeneous and bi-modal PSDs with increasing depth, which in turn can serve as a proxy for increasing state of pedogenesis in peatlands. From this, we derive a nomenclature and size classification for the pore spaces of Sphagnum mosses and define inter-, intra-, and inner-plant pore spaces, with effective pore diameters of > 300, 300-30, and 30-10 mu m, respectively.

AB The Vankervelsvlei mire has one of the thickest peat deposits (more than 10 m) in South Africa, which started accumulating before 7000 BP. Two previous studies on the hydrological system that sustains the wetland reached inconsistent conclusions and disagreed strongly on the main sources of water feeding the wetland. One suggested that the wetland is fed by groundwater discharging from the underlying Table Mountain Group Aquifer, while the other proposed that the wetland is a perched system fed only by precipitation water. We tried to reconcile these discrepancies by measuring water table, hydraulic pressure and temperature in the peat profile and analysing the ionic composition of the groundwater. We also carried out radiocarbon dating (C-14) of groundwater and surface water. Our results showed that both groundwater and surface water are relatively young (<50 years) and that Vankervelsvlei is hydrologically a through-flow system with (local) mineral-poor groundwater entering the mire, possibly from a catchment located in the dunes that lie to the south-east. The groundwater exits the mire at the opposite (northern) side. Our findings do not support either the hypothesis that the mire is fed by groundwater from a deep regional aquifer, or the notion that it is sustained exclusively by precipitation water.

AB The frequency distributions of mire water pH are often bimodal in data sets covering the poor-rich gradient in vegetation. Area-representative data sets of pH could indicate ecologically meaningful differences between regions, independent of differences in mire classification. Comparisons of pH results are, however, hindered by differences in water sampling methods. We conducted a field survey to assess variation of water pH related to the poor-rich gradient, the water-table-depth gradient, time of day, aeration of samples, and different methods of obtaining water samples. Considerable diurnal and fine-scale vertical and horizontal variation of pH was found in samples obtained by depressing from bryophyte capitula or directly from open water surfaces. A diurnal pattern of lower pH at night and higher at day was found, typically with a 0.51.0 pH unit range. Open surface-water samples showed a wide range of fine-scale horizontal variation (pH 4.6-8.0) in Scorpidium-flarks, while pipe-well samples were less variable both in unaerated samples (pH 5.0-5.3) and in aerated samples (pH 6.6-7.3). The frequency distributions of pH of both unaerated and aerated pipe-well samples were bimodal in a data set covering the transition from rich to poor fen. The higher mode was located at pH 5.6 for unaerated samples and at pH 7.6 for aerated samples. The results conformed to the hypothesis of a bimodal frequency distribution of water pH along the poor-rich gradient. A combination of measurements from unaerated and aerated water samples obtained from pipe wells is suggested as a standard method for comparable pH measurements in mires.

AB Nitrate and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations during a summer storm for a forested catchment in the Adirondack Mountains displayed a clear separation in trajectories and timing of maximum values. Nitrate concentrations peaked early on the rising limb of the hydrograph, whereas DOC concentrations gradually increased through the rising limb with maximum concentrations following the discharge peak. Solute data from precipitation, throughfall, soilwater, and ground/till water indicated till water and near-surface soil waters as the controlling end members for stream NO3- and DOC concentrations respectively. Streamflow concentrations of major base cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+), which were assumed to represent water originating from deep flow paths, matched the NO3- trajectory. These data suggest that streamflow NO3- concentrations are derived from till groundwater and that DOC is derived from near-surface soil waters. We attributed the early expression of NO3- to the displacement of till waters by infiltrating precipitation. In contrast, we hypothesized that the delayed DOC concentrations occurred with surface and near-surface runoff from near-stream wetlands/peatlands and isolated saturated areas that became connected only under conditions of maximum water content in the catchment.

AB It has been hypothesized that the trend in increasing DOC concentration in rivers Peat; draining from peat catchments is enhanced by drainage of the peat. It foltows that blocking DOC; of drainage ditches could stabilise or decrease concentrations of DOC in stream water flow-Drainage; ing from peat catchments. This study develops a model for the flux of DOC from a peat catchWater table ment in the North Pennines, UK. This model is used to predict the future DOC flux for an undrained and a drained catchment and for one where the drains were blocked. The model predicted that:
   i. For a pristine catchment the DOC concentration will continue to rise at an average rate of 3% per year;
   ii. Drained catchments export more DOC and increases are of the order of 15-33% over a 10-year period depending upon the drain-spacing;
   iii. When drainage is blocked improvements in DOC export are predicted but the magnitude of the decrease is critically dependent upon the drain-spacing and for the larger drain-spacings no decrease may be observed.
   Over time, the improvements in DOC export are shown to lessen as formerly drained catchments revert to behaviour like that of a pristine catchment. Since pristine catchments are predicted to continue to lose DOC at an increasing rate the blocking of peat drains can only be considered as a medium term strategy for mediating the problem.

AB Climate change mediated drying of boreal peatlands is expected to enhance peatland afforestation and wildfire vulnerability. The water table depth-afforestation feedback represents a positive feedback that can enhance peat drying and consolidation and thereby increase peat burn severity; exacerbating the challenges and costs of wildfire suppression efforts and potentially shifting the peatland to a persistent source of atmospheric carbon. To address this wildfire management challenge, we examined burn severity across a gradient of drying in a black spruce dominated peatland that was partially drained in 1975-1980 and burned in the 2016 Fort McMurray Horse River wildfire. We found that post-drainage black spruce annual ring width increased substantially with intense drainage. Average (+/- SD) basal diameter was 2.6 +/- 1.2 cm, 3.2 +/- 2.0 cm and 7.9 +/- 4.7 cm in undrained (UD), moderately drained (MD) and heavily drained (HD) treatments, respectively. Depth of burn was significantly different between treatments (p < 0.001) and averaged (+/- SD) 2.5 +/- 3.5 cm, 6.4 +/- 5.0 cm and 36.9 +/- 29.6 cm for the UD, MD and HD treatments, respectively. The high burn severity in the HD treatment included 38% of the treatment that experienced combustion of the entire peat profile, and we estimate that overall 51% of the HD pre-burn peat carbon stock was lost. We argue that the HD treatment surpassed an ecohydrological tipping point to high severity peat burn that may be identified using black spruce stand characteristics in boreal plains bogs. While further studies are needed, we believe that quantifying this threshold will aid in developing effective adaptive management techniques and protecting boreal peatland carbon stocks.

DE MODERATE-RICH FEN; GROUND WATER; SOIL; VEGETATION; IRRIGATION; PERIODIC
   ACIDIFICATION
AB In a ground-water discharge fen that supports species-rich herbaceous vegetation, the chemistry of the shallow ground water was monitored over two distinct periods. The fen is situated on a thick sandy aquifer in a region that is known for its acid soils. An irrigation ditch supplies the aquifer with alkaline water just upstream of the fen. Three water types of different origin contribute to the hydrochemical pattern in the en. Recently infiltrated acid ground water is present on higher grounds, neutral-to-alkaline irrigation water discharges at the upper fen margin, and deep ground water that is rich in iron discharges in the lower parts. The soil chemistry and species distribution are in accordance with this pattern: rich fen at the upper margin and poor fen in lower parts. However, we detected considerable hydrochemical variability due to varying influence of water types and temporal acidification of the shallow ground water. The latter leads to anionic dominance shifts from HCO3- to SO42- and the release of base cations in the soil solution. This hydrochemical variability is an additional source of environmental heterogeneity and may thus be partly responsible for the species richness.

AB We fill a gap in understanding wetland vegetation diversity and relationship with environmental determinants in Bulgarian high mountains. A total of 615 phytosociological samples were taken from springs, mires, wet meadows and tall-forb habitats throughout Bulgaria, of which 234 releves are from mire and spring vegetation above timberline. The vegetation was classified by TWINSPAN and the resulting vegetation types were reproduced by the formal definitions using the combination of Cocktail species groups based on phi-coefficient of joint co-occurrence of the species. Nine vegetation types of springs and fens have been clearly delimited above the timberline. All vegetation types include Balkan endemic species, the representation of which varies. Fens generally harbour more Balkan endemics than do springs, with the exception of species-poor high-altitude Drepanocladetum exannulati. The gradient structure of the vegetation was revealed by DCA and by CCA with forward selection of environmental factors. The major determinants of vegetation variation strongly differ above and below the timberline and likewise between springs and fens. The base-richness gradient controls the floristic variation of Bulgarian submontane fens, whereas the complete data set including both submontane and subalpine fens is governed by the altitude gradient from lowland and basin fens to subalpine fens rich in Balkan endemics. When focusing on sites above the timberline only, the first DCA axis separates fens from springs without organic matter. The major species turnover in springs follows the variation in water pH and mineral content in water, whereas fen vegetation variation is primarily controlled by succession gradient of peat accumulation. Altitude remains an important factor in all cases. Weak correlation between water pH and conductivity was found. This correlation was even statistically insignificant in fens above the timberline. Water pH is not influenced by mineral richness in Bulgarian high mountains, since it is buffered by decomposition of organic matter in fens. In springs, pH reaches maximum values due to strong aeration caused by water flow. The plant species richness decreases significantly with increasing altitude. The increase of species richness towards circumneutral pH, often found in mires, was not confirmed in Bulgarian high mountains. The correlation between species richness and pH was significant only when arctic-alpine species and allied European high-mountain species were considered separately. The richness of boreal species was independent on pH. Some of them had their optima shifted to more acidic fens as compared to regions below the timberline. Our results suggest that subalpine spring and fen vegetation should be analysed separately with respect to vegetation-environment correlations. Separate analysis of fens below and above timberline is quite appropriate.

AB Peatland testate amoebae are sensitive indicators of local hydrology and have been used as proxies for surface moisture conditions in fossil studies. However, few regional calibration datasets exist in North America, and knowledge of testate amoeba ecology and distribution patterns are limited. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate the relationship between testate amoebae, environment, and Sphagnum species in Michigan peatlands; (2) generate transfer functions from this dataset that can be applied to fossil data; and (3) describe vertical variation of testate amoebae inhabiting Sphagnum moss. Testate amoeba assemblages from 139 microsites within 11 peatlands in Michigan were compared to assess variability between and within peatlands. Most peatlands contained similar testate amoeba assemblages, although within individual peatlands the amount of assemblage variability is correlated to the amount of environmental heterogeneity. Of the measured environmental variables, depth to water table showed the strongest relationship with testate amoebae. Depth to water table can be reconstructed from fossil data with a mean error of +/- 7.5 cm, although predictive ability deteriorates in extremely dry environments (>30 cm water table depth). Vertical variation in testate amoeba assemblages was investigated at 89 Sphagnum-dominated microsites by directly comparing amoeba assemblages and the abundance and frequency of common taxa in upper and lower portions of the Sphagnum stem. Except for extremely dry microsites, considerable vertical variation in assemblage composition exists. Many agglutinate taxa are more abundant on lower portions of the Sphagnum stem, and taxa containing symbiotic zoochlorellae are more abundant on upper portions. Refinements in sampling procedures and analysis may improve the predictive ability of transfer functions.

AB Pore size, distribution and continuity are important characteristics for the exchange and storage of air and water in artificial mixes. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) measurements can be used to obtain such a characterization. However, two difficulties are encountered when using K-s in potting media. First, the validity of K-s may be limited because it may not apply in media composed of coarse material or peat. Second, the structure of peat substrates is very sensitive and in situ measurements of potted peat substrates (i.e. measurements made directly in the pots) should be carried out to avoid any disruptive effect due to handling. Such a measurement, when made in pots, may require the evaluation of the water flux reduction resulting from the container outflow configuration. The objectives of this study were therefore to check the validity of Darcy's law for peat substrates and to propose an approach for estimating the saturated hydraulic conductivity from flow measurements made in nursery containers. For three different substrates, water flow in artificial mixes followed Darcy's law for hydraulic gradients ranging from 1.1 to 1.6 cm cm(-1). Experimental results showed that the measured fluxes in 5-L, nursery container filled at five different substrate heights (9, 11.5, 14, 16.5 and 19 cm) with laterally located drainage holes were significantly different from those measured in pots with the bottom removed (therefore equivalent to measurement currently made in cylinders) at P = 0.0022. Fluxes in containers with bottoms removed were 7-31% higher than in intact pots. Water flux measurements may therefore need to be corrected for this flux reduction in order to accurately estimate hydraulic conductivity from flow experiments run in pots. A correction factor based on the results obtained from a finite difference model was derived and calibrated. Then, this correction factor was used to convert flux measurements made in pots with lateral holes into equivalent flux that would have been obtained had the pot had an open bottom. After correction, no significant flux reductions were found between pots with open bottoms and pots with lateral holes (P = 0.55). A correction factor estimated from Laplace's equation, once calibrated, can therefore be applied to flux measurements obtained from pots to obtain estimates of K-s of undisturbed potted media.

AB A similar to 7000-year record of sediment accumulation from the San Bernardino cienega in southeastern Arizona/northeastern Sonora records changes in effective moisture. Periods of rapid sedimentation between ca. 700 to 1100 cal yr BP and ca. 4100 to 4400 cal yr BP at San Bernardino are associated with a highstand at pluvial Lake Cochise, the presence of aquatic pollen taxa in New Mexican packrat middens and periods of incision in river channels in the San Pedro and Santa Cruz river valleys. These results suggest that cienega deposits represent records of hydrological change and, as such, are important but under-utilized repositories of paleoclimatic information. These results also inform cienega restoration efforts by highlighting the importance of subsurface and surface water flow through these environments. Effective restoration requires the development of conditions where groundwater maintains surface vegetation and seasonal floods are allowed to inundate the surface. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB An intact hydrologic regime and the presence of peat forming vegetation are critical for the persistence of fen wetlands. Fen restoration projects often focus on reestablishing water tables near the soil surface, with little effort directed toward identifying, historic hydrologic regimes, hydrologic modifications, and the sources of degradation. We used inconsistencies in the modern hydrologic regime and historic hydrologic indicators present in the soil seedbank, vegetation, and organic soil composition to identify areas of Drakesbad Meadow, a mountain fen in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California, that had been degraded. A network of ground-water monitoring wells and piezometers were used to identify the hydrologic regime of the 4.7-ha site. The presence of thick organic soils in sites with deep late summer water tables, inconsistencies between species present in the seedbank and the existing vegetation, and the presence of dry meadow species such as Poapratensis and Hordeum brachyantherum in areas with organic soils were used to determine that 2.4 ha of the site was degraded. A drainage ditch within the fen and diversions of the fen's water supply caused by a road outside of the fen were identified as the source of hydrologic modification and degradation. These were restored by blocking the flow of water in the main drainage ditch and by installing a series of channels to allow water to cross the road. Reconnecting flow beneath the road resulted in raising the summer water table from 80 cm below the soil surface to less than 10 cm in areas downslope of the road. The addition of five sheet-metal dams perpendicular to flow in the main drainage ditch resulted in raising the water table to within 10 to 20 cm of the soil surface in areas adjacent to and down gradient of the ditch. Before restoration, average late August water table levels across the entire site were 30 cm below the soil surface, while average post-restoration water table levels were 19 cm. below the soil surface. One year following hydrologic restoration, the percent canopy cover of species indicative of uplands and wet meadows, but not fens including Deschampsia cespitosa, Hordeum brachyantherum, and Poa pratensis decreased compared with pre-restoration years, while the cover of the peat-forming species Carex utriculata, Scirpus microcarpus, and Carex simulata increased. It is clear from our study that fens in this region will not persist under drought-like conditions created by water diversions, yet well-designed restoration projects can be used to restore modified hydrologic regimes and peat-forming vegetation necessary for the persistence of fen wetlands.

AB Environmental authorities require quantitative predications of the nitrogen retention ability of riparian peatlands to aid in the selection of effective water management strategies for restoration. To support this decision-making process, a matrix model connecting flow paths and nitrogen transformation was developed with a quasi-stationary mass balance approach. The model concept is based on the assumptions that wetlands (1) receive water and nitrogen along several hydrological pathways, and (2) transformation of nitrogen occurs inside the wetland with different efficiencies, depending on the transition pattern between inflow and outflow pathways. These assumptions are formalized in a set of vectors describing the amount of water and the nitrogen concentration for each inflow pathway, a water distribution matrix between the inflowing water and several outflow pathways, a nitrogen transformation coefficient matrix of each inflow and outflow combination and, finally, two outflow vectors with the amount of water flowing out and the calculated nitrogen concentrations of each outflow pathway. The matrix model is applied to a drained valley peatland in order to quantify the effect of different water management options on an increase in nitrogen retention.

AB Calcareous mires are peat forming systems fed by calcareous groundwater that regularly deposit travertine (CaCO3) on the soil surface or in small pools that are present in such mires. At present almost all calcareous mires in Poland are degraded, most often by land use, which has led to disturbances in local hydrological systems. An experiment was set up in a degraded spring mire in western Poland to test if travertine deposition could be restored. Trees were removed to increase surface water temperatures, and a system of open water pools was constructed to measure CaCO3 deposition in the surface water. We also studied three references systems with active CaCO3 deposition in Poland and in Latvia. The pools in the restoration site in Poland showed very little CaCO3 deposition (less than 0.2 mu g center dot cm(-2) center dot d(-1)), while the Polish reference site had significantly higher, but still modest, rates of CaCO3 deposition (ca 0.8 mu g center dot cm(-2) center dot d(-1)). At the reference sites in Latvia, we measured considerable CaCO3 deposition (up to 8 mu g center dot cm(-2) center dot d(-1)). Five years after the restoration measures in the Polish restoration site had been carried out, the vegetation showed little resemblance to the vegetation in spring systems with active calcite deposition in Poland and Latvia. Water analyses showed that the water in our restoration project was not supersaturated by calcite and had very low CO2 concentrations compared to the reference areas. The CO2 concentrations in the pool seemed a good predictor for CaCO3 deposition, better than Ca2+ concentrations. Changes in ground water flows in the source area could have been responsible for the loss of supersaturated groundwater at our restoration site. Our study showed that efforts to restore former calcareous mires can be frustrated when groundwater flow paths have been altered.

AB The hydrogeology between the catchment area and the divided dystrophic Lake Fuchskuhle with respect to the genesis and the land-water interactions were investigated. Water levels at numerous locations in the catchment area were measured in order to characterize the hydrology. The water balance of the area was calculated based on long term climatic investigations. The geology of the peat was documented at 25 sampling points by cores collected with a peat drill. Chemical parameters including pH. total phosphorus and total nitrogen concentrations. DOC concentration. colour (SAK 436 m(-1)) and the UV254/DOC ratio in the catchment area and in two compartments (NE and SW compartment) were determined, The chemical fluxes of DOC, nitrogen and phosphorus from the catchment area into one compartment (SW compartment) were deter-mined. During the genesis of the Lake Fuchskuhle area two aquifer systems (local peat aquifer, regional sandy main aquifer) developed. Both aquifers are largely independently with almost no lateral interactions. Two compartments are supplied with water from the local peat aquifer. From the other two compartments, however. water is flowing out into the peat body. During high groundwater inflow into the SW compartment higher concentration of DOC. nitrogen and phosphorus in the SW compartment were detected. The fen can be divided in two parts: in the meso - to eutrophic fen northwest and the mainly meso - to oligotrophic - acid fen in the southeast. The significant differences in parameters such as pH. conductivity and DOC concentration gave a clear picture of the heterogeneity of the two compartments and their dependence on the catchment area with the two aquifers.

AB Peatland surface patterning motivates studies that identify underlying structuring mechanisms. Theoretical studies so far suggest that different mechanisms may drive similar types of patterning. The long time span associated with peatland surface pattern formation, however, limits possibilities for empirically testing model predictions by field manipulations. Here, we present a model that describes spatial interactions between vegetation, nutrients, hydrology, and peat. We used this model to study pattern formation as driven by three different mechanisms: peat accumulation, water ponding, and nutrient accumulation. By on-and-off switching of each mechanism, we created a full-factorial design to see how these mechanisms affected surface patterning (pattern of vegetation and peat height) and underlying patterns in nutrients and hydrology. Results revealed that different combinations of structuring mechanisms lead to similar types of peatland surface patterning but contrasting underlying patterns in nutrients and hydrology. These contrasting underlying patterns suggest that the presence or absence of the structuring mechanisms can be identified by relatively simple short-term field measurements of nutrients and hydrology, meaning that longer-term field manipulations can be circumvented. Therefore, this study provides promising avenues for future empirical studies on peatland patterning.

AB It is currently recommended to use buffer areas in reducing nutrient export from forested areas to water courses. Nutrient retention in buffer areas has been studied mostly by using artificial nutrient additions, hence information is needed from areas where the increased export originates from an actual forestry practice. We investigated the capacity of riparian buffer areas to reduce the ammonium (NH4-N) export originating from ditch network maintenance areas on boreal forested peatlands. Our results indicated that buffers are inefficient for reducing loadings that already are close to background levels of forested areas. In such a case, the buffer may even release NH4-N into through-flow waters. When the loading rate increased high above the background level, efficient reduction in NH4-N transport became possible. Besides the rate of ammonium loading, a factor behind efficient retention was the sufficient length of the buffer, whereas high volume of runoff decreased retention efficiency. Other buffer characteristics, such as the soil properties (bulk density, CEC), the tree stand structure, and the density of surface vegetation, were insignificant for ammonium retention efficiency.

AB In a future warmer world, peatlands may change from a carbon sink function to a carbon source function. This study tracks changes in water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) after 1 year of in situ experimental warming using open top chambers (OTCs). WEOM was studied in the upper peat layers (0-10 cm) through analysis of water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC), stable C isotopic composition (delta C-13), specific UV absorbance at 280 nm and sugar composition of cores taken from an open bog (DRY sites) and a transitional poor fen (WET sites). At the DRY sites, the impact of OTCs was weak with respect to WEOM parameters, whereas at the WET sites, the air warming treatment led to a decrease in peat water content, suggesting that the supply of heat by OTCs was used mainly for evapotranspiration. OTCs at the WET sites also induced a relative enrichment at the surface (0-5 cm depth) of aliphatic and/or aromatic compounds with concomitant decrease in WEOC, as a result of decomposition. On the contrary, WEOC and sugar content increased in the deeper peat layer (7.5-10 cm depth) probably as a result of increased leaching of phenolic compounds by roots, which then inhibits microbial activity. The different response to experimental warming at DRY and WET sites suggests that the spatial variability of moisture is critical for understanding of the impact of global warming on the fate of OM and the carbon cycle in peatlands.

AB In the near-surface water of Asikkalanselka basin, Lake Paijanne, a slight increase in the Sr-90 content due to river discharges was observed in the years following the Chernobyl accident; later on, the concentration of Sr-90 remained almost the same, while that of Cs-137 decreased. In bottom sediments Sr-90 is detected deeper than Cs-137. In 1995-1997 the transfer of radionuclides with small rivers from the catchments to Asikkalanselka was studied. Cs-137 is leached from bog area into surface water in greater amounts than from other types of catchment. Most of Cs-137 leached to river water was, however, removed with suspended matter to bottom sediment of the river during the river flow before reaching Asikkalanselka. Sr-90 is also leached in greater amounts from the bog area than from other types of land. Removal of Sr-90 from water during the river flow is less significant than that of Cs-137. The role of surface runoff of the two radionuclides from the catchment with small rivers to the lake seems to be of minor importance after ten years elapsed from deposition, as compared to radionuclide exchange with the other parts of the lake, where much greater volumes of water are involved. A satisfactory positive correlation was obtained between the amounts of peat bogs and activity concentrations of Cs-137 in river waters per unit deposition for the five small catchments.

AB In a period with frequently occurring hydrological extremes, research on areas with a high retention potential is brought into focus. The Sumava Mountains peat bogs are important parts of the landscape in the headwater area of the Otava river basin. The study objective is to describe the variability of discharges and the dynamics of groundwater level changes in various types of peat bogs, and to identify connections between observed physico-chemical water properties. This is assessed by basic statistical methods. The rainfall-runoff process and physico-chemical water properties can be affected by many factors. In this case, strong relations between the observed parameters were identified along with considerable differences in the involvement of various types of peat bog sites in the runoff process. It is evident that the peat bog pattern and its vegetation cover have an essential effect on the hydrological regime and water properties stored in a peat bog.

AB The southern Everglades and Florida Bay have experienced a nearly 50 % reduction in freshwater flow resulting in increased salinity and landward expansion of mangrove forest. Given the marine end-member is a natural source of P to this region, it is necessary to understand the interactions between inflows and P availability in controlling the exchange of materials across the mangrove ecotone. From 2007 to 2008, we used sediment core incubations to quantify fluxes of dissolved inorganic N and P and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in three ecotone areas (dwarf mangrove, pond, and bay). Experiments were repeated seasonally over 2 years involving P-enriched surface water as a factor. We saw consistent uptake of soluble reactive P (SRP), DOC, and nitrate + nitrite (N+N) by the soils/sediments and release of ammonium (NH4+) from soils/sediments to the water column across all sites and seasons. P enrichment had no discernible effect on DIN or DOC flux, suggesting that rapid P uptake may have been more geochemically mediated. However, uptake of added P occurred across all sites and seasons, reflecting high uptake capacity in this carbonate system and the potential of the mangrove ecotone to sequester P as it becomes more available.

AB The net ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange (NEE) between boreal bogs and the atmosphere and its environmental drivers remains understudied despite the large carbon store of these northern ecosystems. We present NEE measurements using the eddy covariance technique in a boreal ombrotrophic bog over five growing seasons and four winters. Inter-annual variability in CO2 uptake was most pronounced in June-September (-4 to -122 g CO2-C m(-2)), less in March-May (-1 to -21 g CO2-C m(-2)) and very small in October-November (-2 to -4 g CO2-C m(-2)). Variability in NEE between years was linked primarily to changes in water table depth (WTD). Strong and significant relationships (r(2) > 0.89, p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.05) were found between summer (June-September) maximum photosynthetic rate (A (max)), net ecosystem productivity (NEP), gross ecosystem productivity and WTD. Adding air temperature through multiple regression analysis further increased correlation between summer A (max), NEP, and WTD (r(2) = 0.96, p = 0.05). In contrast to previous studies examining controls on peatland CO2 exchange, no relationships were found between productivity or cumulative exchange and early season temperature, timing of the snowmelt or growing season length.

AB Peatlands represent globally significant soil carbon stores that have been accumulating for millennia under water-logged conditions. However, deepening water-table depths (WTD) from climate change or human-induced drainage could stimulate decomposition resulting in peatlands turning from carbon sinks to carbon sources. Contemporary WTD ranges of testate amoebae (TA) are commonly used to predict past WTD in peatlands using quantitative transfer function models. Here we present, for the first time, a study comparing TA-based WTD reconstructions to instrumentally monitored WTD and hydrological model predictions using the MILLENNIA peatland model to examine past peatland responses to climate change and land management. Although there was very good agreement between monitored and modeled WTD, TA-reconstructed water table was consistently deeper. Predictions from a larger European TA transfer function data set were wetter, but the overall directional fit to observed WTD was better for a TA transfer function based on data from northern England. We applied a regression-based offset correction to the reconstructed WTD for the validation period (1931-2010). We then predicted WTD using available climate records as MILLENNIA model input and compared the offset-corrected TA reconstruction to MILLENNIA WTD predictions over an extended period (1750-1931) with available climate reconstructions. Although the comparison revealed striking similarities in predicted overall WTD patterns, particularly for a recent drier period (1965-1995), there were clear periods when TA-based WTD predictions underestimated (i.e. drier during 1830-1930) and overestimated (i.e. wetter during 1760-1830) past WTD compared to MILLENNIA model predictions. Importantly, simulated grouse moor management scenarios may explain the drier TA WTD predictions, resulting in considerable model predicted carbon losses and reduced methane emissions, mainly due to drainage. This study demonstrates the value of a site-specific and combined data-model validation step toward using TA-derived moisture conditions to understand past climate-driven peatland development and carbon budgets alongside modeling likely management impacts.

AB Peatlands are recognized as important landscape elements and their disturbance, followed by the loss of their ecohydrological functions, leads to falling water tables and degradation. Sometimes, the shortage of hydrological monitoring data impedes the detection of degrading peatland areas. The application of cost-effective remote sensing methods for assessment of humidity conditions permits monitoring of a large area and longer periods of time. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the links between hydrological parameters and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as well as identifying spatio-temporal patterns in the condition of raised bog vegetation, according to NDVI, in the epkeliai raised bog, a semipristine peatland in south-eastern Lithuania. Time series of NDVI (2000-2018) were obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and compared with field measurements. A strong positive correlation between NDVI and water table depth was found. Moderate (for the whole raised bog) and strong (for control subbasin) positive correlations between NDVIavg and annual minimum flow over 30 and 7 days were found. This confirms that NDVI could be treated as an appropriate indicator, showing the degradation processes of the raised bog ecosystem and could be applied in its management. Analysis of the interannual NDVIavg variation confirmed the prevalence of stable favourable conditions during the growing season with a slight decrease in NDVImax over last 4 years. Meanwhile, analysis of spatial NDVI variation revealed obvious spatial patterns where possible degradation processes tend to appear.

TI Subsurface drainage from hummock-covered hillslopes in the Arctic tundra
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE subsurface runoff; peat; arctic tundra; permafrost; modelling
ID PERMAFROST
AB In the Arctic tundra, subsurface drainage occurs predominantly through the saturated zone within the layer of peat that mantles the hillslopes. In plan view, the peat cover is fragmented into a network of channels due to the presence of mineral earth hummocks. In cross section, the physical and hydraulic properties of the peat vary with depth and the water transmission characteristics (e.g. hydraulic conductivity) of the upper profile differ distinctly from those of the lower. Water flow through the peat is laminar, therefore the friction factor (f) and the Reynolds number (N-R) are inversely related. Average values for the coefficient C of the relation f = C/N-R, vary from similar to 300 near the surface to similar to 14,500 at depth. This large difference in C confirms that the larger-diameter soil pores of the living vegetation and lightly decomposed peat near the surface offer much less resistance to water motion than the finer-grained peat deeper in the profile. Also, the variability suggests that subsurface drainage is strongly affected by the position and thickness of the saturated zone within the peat matrix. A first approximation for a model or simulation of the how regime may consider a peat profile with depth-varying, resistance properties in respect to subsurface flow. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Landslides are an important natural phenomenon of the flysch Outer Western Carpathians that diversify the local topography and provide valuable microrefugia in the geomorphologically uniform region. For the first time, we reconstructed the continuous history of Carpathian landslide wetland - the Kotelnice mire, which initiated at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, using joint analysis of abiotic proxies, pollen, plant macrofossils and testate amoebae (TA). We utilised modern training datasets of plants and TA to define ecological requirements of species and to determine indicators of either bog or fen habitats. We further compared pollen representation of selected woody species between two landslide-related wetlands and two spring fens, not related to landslides within the study region. The unique feature of the Kotelnice mire is the development of a nearly ombrotrophic bog at similar to 2500 cal BP that was after similar to 1500 years reversed to a poor fen by intense deforestation and pastoralism. Pollen analysis and its intraregional comparison demonstrate a dual refugial role of landslides in the Carpathians. In the Early Holocene and perhaps even in the Late Glacial, landslides provided refugia for warmth-and moisture demanding species (e.g. lime, elm, hazel, beech, maple). On the contrary, they provided shelter for cold-demanding boreal species (e.g. spruce, Eriophorum vaginatum, Sphagnum medium/divinum) in the Middle and Late Holocene. Because the analogous refugial role of landslides at both the recent and the Quaternary time scales has been reported from the flysch-like and volcanite bedrocks across the Northern Hemisphere, landslides deserve more attention in searching for regionally or even globally crucial refugia.

AB A detailed investigation into sulphur leaching in peatland headwater catchments in the South Pennines, UK shows that, despite significant reductions in sulphur emissions, sulphur remains a key acidifier. This sulphur can be considered as legacy atmospheric pollution, stored within the peat by processes of dissimilatory sulphate reduction and now being leached into the region's surface waters. Persistently lower water tables at gully edge locations define a thick erosional acrotelm that is vulnerable to aeration, oxidation and flushing throughout the year, and not solely confined to periods of drought. Stream discharge behaves as a two-end member system, whereby pre-event water, rich in DOC and sulphate, is diluted by event water as a result of event water flowing through fast flow pathways such as macropores and overland flow. A rapid increase in water table elevation during the storm and a decrease in elevation after the storm indicate that event water has infiltrated the peat and has then been released into the stream. Streamwaters in peat dominated upland catchments with high densities of gullying have high concentrations of sulphate and low concentrations of DOC, whereas the reverse is true for those catchments with low densities of gullying. This is consistent with the concept that high concentrations of sulphate can suppress the solubility of DOC. A significant store of sulphate exists within South Pennine peats, and continued gully erosion will enhance sulphur leaching meaning that the timescale involved for any depletion is uncertain. It is therefore important that models predicting recovery from acidification in these upland systems include an understanding of how this stored sulphur is being leached, especially with respect to gully erosion, climate change and reduced precipitation.

AB Late-Holocene peat stratigraphy of a Canadian boreal peat bog was examined to evaluate the potential of Sphagnum delta C-13 values as surface moisture proxy indicators. Isotopic measurements were compared to testate amoebae-inferred water-table depth reconstructions, plant macrofossil assemblages and past decomposition levels inferred by colorimetric humification. AMS radiocarbon dates were coupled with Pb-210 dates to establish peat chronology. Although the mechanisms underlying carbon fractionation processes in peatlands are not well understood, we demonstrate that Sphagnum delta C-13 values have potential for palaeohydrological reconstructions, since variations presented by the isotopic values can generally be correlated with the other proxy records, especially during drier episodes.

AB The Florida Everglades is an oligotrophic wetland system with tree islands as one of its most prominent landscape features. Total soil phosphorus concentrations on tree islands can be 6 to 100 times greater than phosphorus levels in the surrounding marshes and sloughs, making tree islands nutrient hotspots. Several mechanisms are believed to redistribute phosphorus to tree islands: subsurface water flows generated by evapotranspiration of trees, higher deposition rates of dry fallout, deposition of guano by birds and other animals, groundwater upwelling, and bedrock mineralization by tree exudates. A conceptual model is proposed, in which the focused redistribution of limiting nutrients, especially phosphorus, onto tree islands controls their maintenance and expansion. Because of increased primary production and peat accretion rates, the redistribution of phosphorus can result in an increase in both tree island elevation and size. Human changes to hydrology have greatly decreased the number and size of tree islands in parts of the Everglades. The proposed model suggests that the preservation of existing tree islands, and ultimately of the Everglades landscape, requires the maintenance of these phosphorus redistribution mechanisms.

AB Knowledge of gas exchange dynamics is important in determining the suitability of growing media used in nursery and greenhouse production. However, gas diffusion measurement methods are difficult to use directly in potted growing media and a rapid, simpler, and reliable approach appears desirable for routine assessment of gas diffusivity. This study compares gas diffusivity and pore efficiency estimates from diffusion chamber measurement with indirect estimates obtained from water storage and flow measurements and point of air entry values for various substrates. Four peat substrates with bark in variable particle sizes, a mineral soil, and silica sand were packed into aluminum cores in four replicates and then saturated for 72 h. After equilibration at - 0.8 kPa of water potential on a tension table, the concentrations of N-2 diffusing through these cores were measured in a gas diffusion chamber and gas diffusivity calculated from the gas concentration change in time. Diffusivity was also calculated with the water curve and the saturated hydraulic conductivity, also measured on the same core ( indirect approach). The gas diffusivity estimates obtained by gas diffusion chamber measurement were significantly correlated (R-2 = 0.49, slope not different from 1) with those obtained from the indirect approach. Estimates obtained for pore efficiency were much closer and less variable than those for gas diffusivity (R-2 = 0.80, slope not different from 1). The indirect approach may be a useful tool for the rapid assessment of gas exchange dynamics in growing media under undisturbed conditions.

AB Northern peatlands are forecast to experience changes in surface temperatures and precipitation patterns in the next century, with implications for their long-term water table position. Because peatlands are a large global C sink, it is important to investigate how multidecadal changes to hydrology will influence peat quality and C cycling. We examined peat substrate quality along a gradient of long-term water table alterations (reference, wet, and dry) across a peatland complex in northern Michigan with Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, aerobic and anaerobic incubations, and elemental analyses. Peat substrate quality was determined by the intrinsic differences between hummock and lawn peat, in addition to being affected by changes in hydrology. These factors altered decomposition processes and created differences in vegetation communities and structure across the long-term water table gradient. Our data suggest that peat from inundated sites is the most labile and that long-term drainage results in degraded peat quality. There may be interactive effects of climate change for increased trace gas production if wet sites drain, particularly if lawn microforms are dominant. Wet hummocky peatlands might be more resistant to increased trace gas production if the depth to water table changes with climate. These results indicate that peatlands impacted by long-term water table changes will experience shifts in substrate quality with concurrent changes in greenhouse gas emissions and highlight the need to incorporate microtopography in assessing the sensitivity of mineralization processes.

AB Drained peatlands dominated by purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea) are widespread in the UK and Western Europe. Although substantial carbon stores may be present in these peatlands, in this degraded state they are not currently acting as carbon sinks. Therefore, M.caerulea dominated peatlands have been identified as potential sites for ecohydrological restoration to tackle the current climate emergency. However, at present little is known about whether ditch blocking can raise water tables and promote the recovery of bog plant species, and the subsequent effects on carbon sequestration in these peatlands.
   To investigate the potential for restoration, we measured changes in water table depth, vegetation composition, photosynthesis at 1000 mu mol Photons m(-2) s(-1) (P-G1000), ecosystem respiration (R-Eco) and partitioned below-ground respiration in two M.caerulea dominated peatlands in which drainage ditches had been blocked located in Exmoor National Park, southwest England. Measurements were made in two headwater catchments at 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 of the distance between adjacent drainage ditches at four control-restored paired sites, during the growing seasons pre- (2012) and post- (2014, 2016 & 2018) restoration.
   Restoration had a small but significant (p = 0.009) effect on water table depths however, this did not result in a significant change in vegetation composition (p > 0.350). Ecosystem respiration increased in both the control and restored locations following restoration however, this increase was significantly smaller (p = 0.010) at the restored locations, possibly due to a similarly reduced increase in photosynthesis, although this change was not significant (p = 0.116). Below-ground respiration showed no significant changes following restoration.
   This research illustrates how degraded these shallow peatlands are, and raises concerns that ditch blocking alone may not bring about the high and stable water tables required to perturb the existing Molinia caerulea-dominated ecosystem and substantially alter the carbon balance. Additional restoration measures may be required.

AB [1] Northern peatlands contain enormous quantities of organic carbon within a few meters of the atmosphere and play a significant role in the planetary carbon balance. We have developed a new, process-oriented model of the contemporary carbon balance of northern peatlands, the Peatland Carbon Simulator (PCARS). Components of PCARS are (1) vascular and nonvascular plant photosynthesis and respiration, net aboveground and belowground production, and litterfall; (2) aerobic and anaerobic decomposition of peat; (3) production, oxidation, and emission of methane; and (4) dissolved organic carbon loss with drainage water. PCARS has an hourly time step and requires air and soil temperatures, incoming radiation, water table depth, and horizontal drainage as drivers. Simulations predict a complete peatland C balance for one season to several years. A 3-year simulation was conducted for Mer Bleue Bog, near Ottawa, Ontario, and results were compared with multiyear eddy covariance tower CO(2) flux and ancillary measurements from the site. Seasonal patterns and the general magnitude of net ecosystem exchange of CO(2) were similar for PCARS and the tower data, though PCARS was generally biased toward net ecosystem respiration (i.e., carbon loss). Gross photosynthesis rates (calculated directly in PCARS, empirically inferred from tower data) were in good accord, so the discrepancy between model and measurement was likely related to autotrophic and/or heterotrophic respiration. Modeled and measured methane emission rates were quite low. PCARS has been designed to link with the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) land surface model and a global climate model (GCM) to examine climate-peatland carbon feedbacks at regional scales in future analyses.

AB Testate amoebae are valuable indicators of peatland hydrology and have been used in many palaeoclimatic studies in peatlands. Because the species' ecological optima may vary around the globe, the development of transfer function models is an essential prerequisite for regional palaeoclimatic studies using testate amoebae. We investigated testate amoebae ecology in nine peatlands covering a 250-km north-south transect in south-central Alaska. Redundancy analysis and Mantel tests were used to establish the relationship between the measured environmental variables (water-table depth and pH) and testate amoebae communities. Transfer-function models were developed using weighted averaging, weighted average partial least squares and maximum likelihood techniques. Model prediction error was initially 15.8 cm for water-table depth and 0.3 for pH but this was reduced to 9.7 cm and 0.2 by selective data exclusion. The relatively poor model performance compared with previous studies may be explained by the limitations of one-off water-table measurements, the very large environmental gradients covered and by recent climatic change in the study area. The environmental preferences of testate amoebae species agree well with previous studies in other regions. This study supports the use of testate amoebae in palaeoclimate studies and provides the first testate amoebae transfer function from Alaska.

AB In this study, we present a record spanning the last 4000 years from a Baltic bog (Kusowskie Bagno) in northern Poland. Using numerous biotic and abiotic proxies, such as testate amoebae (depth to water table reconstructions), stable carbon isotopes (C-13), plant macrofossils (proxies for local vegetation and mire surface wetness), pollen and spores (proxies for regional vegetation and human impact), we reconstructed and identified the regional hydro-climatic signal of Kusowskie Bagno bog and compared it to other bog records around the Baltic Sea. Our aims were to: 1) combine the species traits of bryophytes and testate amoebae, and more common proxies (isotopes, plant micro-and macro-remains) to infer past peatland development, 2) compare the hydroclimatic signal of Kusowskie Bagno bog to existing records around the Baltic Sea. We found that Kusowskie Bagno bog was very wet during the last 4000 years, and even drainage and peat exploitation had not disturbed its hydrology in northern part in the last 200 years. Carbon isotopes and plant macrofossils were significantly related to specific traits of testate amoebae, which in turn reflected the water table changes over the last 4000 years. Kusowskie Bagno recorded at least the following wet shifts: AD 250, 550, 850, 1250 and 1700, while wet conditions occurred during the Migration period at ca AD 550. Furthermore, the testate amoeba-based quantitative wetness reconstruction in Kusowskie Bagno bog resembles the pattern observed in other sites around the Baltic, i.e., Estonia, Finland, Ireland, northern Britain and the 7500-year record from the Stazki bog, northern Poland. Our results provided statistically validated evidence that interactions between plant and microbe need to be more considered further to reconstruct past hydrological. This is the first study of past hydro-climatic changes in peatlands based upon a trait-based approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we aimed to deduce changes in flow and transport patterns with titanium dioxide (TiO2) as a dye tracer during the course of soil degradation resulting from peat drainage. The dye tracer experiments were carried out on columns of eight types of differently degraded peat soil from three sites taken in both vertical and horizontal directions. The titanium dioxide suspension (average particle size of 0.3 mu m; 10gl(-1)) was applied in a pulse of 40mm to each soil core. The cores were subsequently cut into six slices, photographed and the images were analysed for the extent of dye cover and number of pores. In addition, the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) was determined. Preferential flow occurred in all of the peat types investigated. From the stained soil structural elements, we concluded that undecomposed plant remains are the major preferential flow pathways in less degraded peat. For more strongly degraded peat, bio-pores, such as root and earthworm channels, operated as the major transport network. Results show that K-s and the effective pore network in less degraded peat soil are anisotropic. With increasing peat degradation, K-s and the cross-section of effective pores decreased in the predominant direction only and the anisotropy of both properties decreased. The K-s was closely related to the number of macropores and pore continuity. Therefore, we conclude that changes in flow and transport pathways and K-s with increasing peat degradation result from the disintegration of the peat-forming plant material and the decrease in number and continuity of macropores.
   We aimed to deduce changes in flow and transport patterns during peat degradation.
   TiO2 (dye tracer) was used to visualize the flow and transport patterns in degraded peat soil.
   The preferential flow paths, K-s and pore structures changed with peat degradation.
   Changes in flow and transport paths and K-s relate to peat-forming plant materials and pore structure.

AB This paper presents a palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the Wilczkow fen (central Poland). The fen developed in an inactive valley at the onset of the Holocene (similar to 11 ka BP) and peat accumulation lasted until 5.7 ka BP. Multi-proxy reconstructions were made on the basis of palaeobotanical, cladoceran, chironomid, beetle and geochemical analyses. A Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM, unsupervised artificial neural network) of the biotic sequence distinguished four stages of fen history. Stage X-1 (11.0-10.7 ka BP) was relatively wet and cool. Organic matter started to accumulate but the habitat conditions remained unstable. Moss, sedge and fern communities then developed. Sedimentary changes reveal an intensive groundwater supply at that time. Numerous and diverse chironomid and cladoceran subfossils indicate nearly permanent aquatic conditions. During stage Y-1 (10.6-9.2 ka BP) conditions were dry and the upper peat layer desiccated. Cladocera nearly disappeared whereas chironomids were represented by semi-terrestrial and predatory (Tanypodinae) species. Conditions started to be more reducing. All the remaining samples belonged to the interweaving stages X-2 and Y-2. Stage Y-2 (mostly 9.1-7.3 and 6.0-5.7 ka BP) was also dry but humidity increased towards the top. Oxidizing conditions occurred and the pH became more alkaline, favouring Cladium mariscus. The basin received mostly allochthonous matter input at that time. Stage X-2 (mostly 6.8-6.1 ka BP) was humid and warm. The groundwater supply remained low but there was an increase in precipitation, changing local conditions to ombrotrophic. Species-rich chironomid and cladoceran communities were associated with temporary pools. Finally, conditions returned to those characteristic of stage Y-2. The presented reconstruction documents long-term abiotic and biotic changes determined by water supply, including groundwater outflow, which have rarely been detected at a multi-proxy scale. We show that inactivated valley fens are sensitive to climate-driven hydrological fluctuations. Kohonen neural networks appear to be a promising method for analysing variability in multi-proxy data.

AB Soil moisture is one of the key parameters controlling biogeochemical processes in peat and other organic soils. To understand and accurately model soil moisture dynamics and peatland hydrological functioning in general, knowledge about soil hydraulic properties is crucial. As peat differs in several aspects from mineral soils, the applicability of standard hydraulic functions (e.g. van Genuchten-Mualem model) developed for mineral soils to peat soil moisture dynamics might be questionable. In this study, the hydraulic properties of five types of peat and other organic soils from different German peatlands have been investigated by laboratory evaporation experiments. Soil hydraulic parameters of the commonly-applied van Genuchten-Mualem model and the bimodal model by Durner (1994) were inversely estimated using HYDRUS-1D and global optimization. The objective function included measured pressure heads and cumulative evaporation. The performance of eight model set-ups differing in the degree of complexity and the choice of fitting parameters were evaluated. Depending on the model set-up, botanical origin and degree of peat decomposition, the quality of the model results differed strongly. We show that fitted 'tortuosity' parameters tau of the van Genuchten-Mualem model can deviate very much from the default value of 0.5 that is frequently applied to mineral soils. Results indicate a rather small decrease of the hydraulic conductivity with increasing suction compared to mineral soils. Optimizing tau did therefore strongly reduce the model error at dry conditions when high pressure head gradients occurred. As strongly negative pressure heads in the investigated peatlands rarely occur, we also reduced the range of pressure heads in the inversion to a 'wet range' from 0 to 200 cm. For the 'wet range' model performance was highly dependent on the inclusion of macropores. Here, fitting only the macropore fraction of the bimodal model as immediately drainable additional pore space seems to be a practical approach to account for the macropore effect, as the fitting of the full bimodal model led to only marginal further improvement of model performance. This keeps the number of parameters low and thus provides a model that is more easily managed in pedotransfer function development and practical applications like large scale simulations. Our findings point out first options to improve the performance of the frequently-used simple single-domain models when they are applied to organic soils. We suggest further performance evaluation of these models during wetting periods when they are known to fail to describe preferential and non-equilibrium flow phenomena. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Located on the western flank of the Changbai Mountains in Northeast China, Hani (HN) peatland has been studied intensively for Holocene paleoclimate reconstruction on decadal to centennial scales. This study presented new datasets of hydroclimatic controls on the distribution and abundance of mosses through modern vegetation survey and plant macrofossil analysis of a historical peat profile. Survey on the abundance of ten different moss species in 40 vegetation quadrats and their depths to water table (DWT) in the HN mire have been conducted during the growing season (June to October) in 2015 and 2016. Our results indicated that (1) the abundances of these mosses showed close relationship with DWTs; and (2) DWT was a function of local precipitation with lower DWT corresponding to higher precipitation. Sphagnum fallax, S. cuspidatum and S. subsecundum preferred wet microhabitats under higher precipitation (i.e., lower DWT), and vice versa. Hence, the variation in the abundance of these sphagna was considered to be an indicator of changes in precipitation. An equation for quantitative estimation of DWT based on the abundances of the moss species along different moisture habitats has been established based on the modern survey, which was able to reconstruct the variation of DWT in the past from plant macrofossil analysis.
   A 50 cm core from HN mire was dated by AMS C-14, Pb-210, and Cs-137 methods, providing a 50-year record of hydroclimate. Plant macrofossils were identified at 1 cm intervals of the peat core, which exhibited detailed variations of the moss assemblages. The variation of DWT reconstructed from the coverage of S. fallax and the total coverage of S. fallax, S. cuspidatum and S. subsecundum in the core matched well in peak-to-peak and trough-to-trough with local growing season precipitation on annual scale during the past 50 years. Our study suggests that selecting well-responsive Sphagnum species is a key factor to reconstruct hydroclimate by using plant macrofossils.

AB It is widely recognised that wetlands play an important role in the hydrological cycle, influencing groundwater recharge, low flows, evaporation and floods. This has led to policies being formulated world-wide to conserve and manage wetlands to deliver these key services, especially flood risk reduction. Generic statements have often been published about wetland hydrological services but the term "wetlands" covers many land types, including wet woodlands, reedbeds, peat bogs, fens, and salt marshes. Each of these wetland types can have a hydrological function that is subtly different, making it difficult to generalise the flood reduction services of wetlands. In this paper we focus on two example wetland types (upland rain-fed wetlands and floodplain wetlands) to demonstrate why there are differences in flood functions both within and between wetland types. Upland wetlands generally tend to be flood generating areas while floodplain wetlands have a greater potential to reduce floods. However, landscape location and configuration, soil characteristics, topography, soil moisture status and management all influence whether these wetlands provide flood reduction services.

AB Groundwater chemistry is a major determinant of assemblages of various taxonomic groups in spring fens, but its effect on insect assemblages has not been proved yet. We investigated dipteran assemblages at 17 isolated spring fens, which encompass the whole mineral richness gradient from rich (calcareous) to poor (highly acidic) sites, and analyzed faunal patterns at two contrasting mesohabitats: flowing water and standing water. The effect of water chemistry, substratum features, discharge, and temperature on the dipteran assemblages were assessed using PERMANOVA and GAM. Highly diverse dipteran assemblages (156 taxa) were closely related to the mineral richness gradient at both mesohabitats, showing a continual and nearly complete species exchange along the gradient, while their total abundance and taxa density did not change significantly. The assemblages included both habitat generalists and taxa specifically associated with acidic, moderate, or calcareous conditions. The mineral richness gradient was also reflected by changes in substratum properties, thus creating a complex environmental gradient that we suggest is the main environmental gradient structuring aquatic assemblages in spring fens.

AB Spatial and temporal variability in surface water chemistry, organic soil chemistry and hydrologic indicators were investigated at three poor-fen complexes in two boreal catchments in Northern Alberta to provide insight into the dominant controls on surface water chemistry. Improved understanding of these controls is required to enable prediction of runoff chemistry in the region under changing atmospheric deposition conditions. Surface water chemistry exhibited considerable variability; within each fen conductivity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and Cl(-) tended to decrease and pH tended to increase with increasing distance from the lake edge. Variations in evaporative isotopic enrichment in (2)H and (18)O, expressed as deuterium excess, were used to distinguish between throughflow waters and those that were more evaporatively enriched. Throughflow surface waters were more acidic primarily due to higher concentrations of DOC and NO(3)(-). Exchangeable base saturation and pH of organic soils were strongly related to surface water chemistry at two of the fen complexes, demonstrating the capacity for cation exchange to influence surface water chemistry. Fen surface water concentrations of most elements and DOC increased during the summer period (between June and August), while pH of water decreased. Evaporative concentration of the surface waters was a dominant driver, with surface water temperature increasing at both catchments. Localized groundwater discharge was an important contributor of base cations to the fens, while the organic soils are sinks for atmospherically deposited SO(4)(2-), N and Cl(-).

AB Peatland carbon and water cycling are tightly coupled, so dynamic modeling of peat accumulation over decades to millennia should account for carbon-water feedbacks. We present initial results from a new simulation model of long-term peat accumulation, evaluated at a wellstudied temperate bog in Ontario, Canada. The Holocene Peat Model (HPM) determines vegetation community composition dynamics and annual net primary productivity based on peat depth (as a proxy for nutrients and acidity) and water table depth. Annual peat (carbon) accumulation is the net balance above-and below-ground productivity and litter/peat decomposition -a function of peat hydrology (controlling depth to and degree of anoxia). Peat bulk density is simulated as a function of degree of humification, and affects the water balance through its influence on both the growth rate of the peat column and on peat hydraulic conductivity and the capacity to shed water. HPM output includes both time series of annual carbon and water fluxes, peat height, and water table depth, as well as a final peat profile that can be "cored" and compared to field observations of peat age and macrofossil composition. A stochastic 8500-yr, annual precipitation time series was constrained by a published Holocene climate reconstruction for southern Qu ' ebec. HPM simulated 5.4m of peat accumulation (310 kg Cm-2) over 8500 years, 6.5% of total NPP over the period. Vascular plant functional types accounted for 65% of total NPP over 8500 years but only 35% of the final (contemporary) peat mass. Simulated age-depth and carbon accumulation profiles were compared to a radiocarbon dated 5.8 m, c. 9000-yr core. The simulated core was younger than observations at most depths, but had a similar overall trajectory; carbon accumulation rates were generally higher in the simulation and were somewhat more variable than observations. HPM results were sensitive to centuryscale anomalies in precipitation, with extended drier periods (precipitation reduced similar to 10%) causing the peat profile to lose carbon (and height), despite relatively small changes in NPP.

AB Testate amoebae and stable isotopes have been used as surface-moisture proxies in peatlands. However, adequate modern calibration is critical to successful application and interpretation. Testate amoebae, delta C-13 of Sphagnum, and environmental conditions were examined at 126 sites within 12 peatlands of south-central and central Alaska to assess the potential of testate amoebae and delta C-13 as surface-moisture proxies. Results indicate that water-table depth and pH were both correlated with testate amoeba community composition. However, the relative importance of these two variables varied, with pH more important in wetter habitats and water-table depth more important in drier habitats. Cross-validation of transfer functions indicated that water-table depth and pH can be inferred from testate amoeba communities with mean errors of similar to 8 cm and similar to 0.4 pH units, respectively, an improvement over previous calibration work in the region. However, application of these transfer functions should consider potential temporal variability in the relative importance of pH and water-table depth, and we applied our calibration data set to a subfossil testate amoeba record to highlight how knowledge of changes in the relative importance of these environmental variables can inform interpretation. In contrast with testate amoebae, delta C-13 of Sphagnum was found to be a relatively weak indicator of water-table depth. Variable carbon sources for Sphagnum photosynthesis, such as CO2 released by methanotrophic bacteria, likely complicate the relationship between delta C-13 and moisture. Although more work is needed before delta C-13 of Sphagnum can be used as a proxy for water-table depth, testate amoebae should be useful in paleoenvironmental studies of peatlands in Alaska.

AB The hydrology of Quebec, Canada, boreal fens is poorly documented. Many peatlands are located in watersheds with impounded rivers. In such cases, their presence influences reservoir inflows. In recent years, some fens have been subjected to an increase of their wet area, a sign that they may be evolving towards an aquatic ecosystem. This dynamic process is called aqualysis. This article presents the seasonal and monthly hydrological budgets of a small watershed including a highly aqualysed fen (James Bay region). The monitoring of precipitation (P), runoff (Q) and groundwater levels (WL) was conducted during the ice-free season. Three semiempirical equations (Thornthwaite, PriestleyTaylor and PenmanMonteith) were used and compared to calculate potential evapotranspiration. The first two equations, having fewer parameters, estimate higher potential evapotranspiration values than the third equation. The use of pressure-level gauges installed in wells, for the calculation of peatland water storage, is inconclusive. Swelling of peat, peat decomposition and plant composition could be responsible for nonnegligible amounts of absorbed water, which are not entirely accounted for by well levels. The estimation of peat matrix water storage is potentially the largest source of error and the limiting factor to calculate water balances in this environment. The results show that the groundwater level and the water storage vary depending on the season and especially after a heavy rainfall. Finally, the results illustrate the complexity of water routing through the site and thus raise several questions to be resolved in the future. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Accurate modelling of peat water contents (theta) is critical for wetland studies. We modified the Campbell and Van Genuchten soil water retention curves (SWRCs) by replacing their empirical parameters with measurable properties. Combining the water table depth (d (WT)) into SWRCs, we derived formulae for calculating volumetric theta from d (WT), coded in a simple model to test our hypotheses that d (WT) is a reliable predictor of theta for peat of low and high water holding capacity at near-saturation. We compared our simulations with time-domain reflectometry theta measurements at Mer Bleue bog (Ontario, Canada) and the Western Peatland fen (Alberta, Canada). Constraining Campbell SWRC at extreme drying and waterlogging rather than wilting point and field capacity produced superior results. The Van Genuchten SWRC was approximated by hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic segments. When simplified, its performance reconciles with that of the modified Campbell SWRC. Overall, our formulae performed well with generalized peat parameters.

AB Mine reclamation in the Athabasca oil sands region is legally required as companies must reconstruct disturbed landscapes into functioning ecosystems which previously existed in the Boreal landscape. Upland-wetland systems are relatively new in the constructed landscape and only two exist to date. The objective of this work is to understand the key hydrological changes post-management of a constructed peatland watershed and provide insight on the overall system function. Six years of hydrometric data are presented from the Sandhill Fen Watershed (SFW), a 52-ha upland-wetland catchment built on soft tailings with a pump system to provide fresh water, support drainage, and limit salinization. Wet years (seasonal precipitation evapotranspiration) occurred in 2013, 2016 and 2018 and dry years (seasonal precipitation < evapotranspiration) occurred in 2014, 2015 and 2017 where wet years had large 5-, 10- and 100-year storms which were absent in dry years. Surface conductance and solar radiation explained most of the variation in ET fluxes. Changes in management practices drove many of the observed hydrological changes. Heavy management in 2013 muted water table (WT) responses to climate as inflow and outflow (via pumps) controlled WT response. After 2014, management efforts declined and hydrological exchanges were predominantly vertical, and saturated storage across the wetland increased. As a result, WT variability was tightly coupled to ET regardless of WT position relative to the ground surface, with greater changes related to deeper water tables, suggesting the absence of water conserving feedback mechanisms. Intrawatershed water movement was primarily towards the wetland from recharge areas in the upland swale, whereas surface runoff was rare and only occurred during extreme rain events and spring snowmelt. Peat properties were degraded compared to those observed in undisturbed peatlands, and natural stratification of the peat profile was absent. Results suggest that current conditions are not favorable for fen-peatland development as marsh-like conditions have developed, limiting water conserving functions and the ability to persist long-term in a changing climate.

AB Boreal peatlands are substantial sources of isoprene, a reactive hydrocarbon. However, it is not known how much mosses, vascular plants and peat each contribute to isoprene emission from peatlands. Furthermore, there is no information on the effects of declining water table depth on isoprene emission in these naturally wet ecosystems, although water table is predicted to decline due to climate warming. We studied the relative contribution of mosses vs. vascular plants to isoprene emission in boreal peatland microcosms in growth chambers by removing either vascular vegetation or both vascular vegetation and mosses. The microcosms represented wet hollows and dry hummocks of a boreal ombrotrophic bog. A water table drawdown treatment was applied to the hollows with naturally high water table. The mean (+/- SE) isoprene emission from hummocks with intact vegetation, 30 +/- 6 mu g m(-2) h(-1), was decreased by over 90% with removal of vascular plants or all vegetation. Thus, our results indicate that vascular plants, in contrast to mosses, were the main source of isoprene in the studied peatland ecosystem. Water table drawdown also significantly decreased the emissions: the mean isoprene emission from hollows with intact vegetation, 45 +/- 6 mu g m(-2) h(-1), was decreased by 25% under water table drawdown. However, water table drawdown reduced net ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange more dramatically than isoprene emission. Isoprene emission strongly correlated with both CO2 exchange and methane emission. In conclusion, isoprene emissions from peatlands will decrease, but the proportion of assimilated carbon lost as isoprene will increase, if the naturally high water table declines under the changing climate.

AB Green roofs are used increasingly to alleviate peaks of water discharge into the sewage systems in urban areas. Surface runoff from roofs contain pollutants from dry and wet deposition, and green roofs offer a possibility to reduce the amounts of pollutants in the water discharged from roofs by degradation and filtering. These pollutants would otherwise enter wastewater treatments plants and ultimately end up in sewage sludge that is spread on agricultural soils. The most common substrates used in green roofs have limited capacity for filtration and sorption. Also, more sustainable alternatives are sought, due to the high carbon footprint of these materials. Biochar is a carbon-rich material produced by pyrolysis of biomass, and several types of biochar have been described as good sorbents and filter materials. Biochar is also a light and carbon negative material, which may fulfill other desired criteria for new green roof substrates. We here report on an experiment where two types of biochar, produced from olive husks at 450 A degrees C or from forest waste at 850 A degrees C were mixed with volcanic rock or peat, and tested for retention capacity of phenanthrene and six heavy metals in a column experiment with unsaturated gravimetric water flow lasting for 3 weeks. The results suggest that biochar as a component in green roof substrates perform better than traditional materials, concerning retention of the tested pollutants, and that different types of biochar have different properties in this respect.

AB This study aims to reconstruct the recent dynamics of two bogs located in an agricultural landscape and to determine which factors favour tree expansion, the most salient change recently reported in treeless peatlands. The vegetation and hydrological dynamics of the bogs as well as land use changes in the vicinity were reconstructed using a combination of paleoecological, paleohydrological, and historical approaches. It was hypothesized that upland deforestation indirectly induced atmospheric mineral dust deposition on sites, thus increasing nutrient availability and triggering forest expansion. Results indicated that a widespread, but asynchronous tree expansion occurred in both bogs during the 20th century. However, no evidence suggesting that nutrient enrichment favoured the phenomenon was found. Forest expansion seems rather to have been favoured by drying of the peat surface, as a decrease of the water table depth coincided with the beginning of the forest encroachment on both sites. This drying correlated with the establishment of an in situ artificial drainage ditch on one site and with agricultural development in the catchment of the other. Local historical factors of each site apparently override regional factors such as climate anomalies or upland deforestation in explaining rapid, abrupt changes in bogs.

AB Overland Bow technique, which involves conducting wastewater across a natural mire, has during the recent years been widely used in Finland to decrease the loading of P and other elements from peat mining areas to the watercourses. In this study the applicability of laboratory tests in estimating the P retention by overland Bow areas was assessed at a site in northern Finland. The ability of peat to retain PO4-P was determined by adsorption isotherms, and the data were compared with the actual decreases in P loads obtained in the held. The PO4-P retention curves obeyed rather well the conventional adsorption models, which suggests that sorption can be an important mechanism removing PO4-P from the pest mining drainage water during overflow treatment. The Freundlich equation gave a better fit to the P sorption than did the one-surface Langmuir model. The constants describing the sorption characteristics of the peat showed spatial and temporal variation. They indicated, however, that the theoretical effective P sorption time for the overland Bow area can be 20 to 25 yr. The ability of peat to retain P increased with increasing concentrations of oxalate extractable Fe and Al. Sorption reactions were found to be important in the annual decreases in PO4-P from drainage waters in an overland flow area, but their efficiency in removing P from the peat mining drainage water appears to depend on hydrological conditions. In the first experimental year, the sorption calculated from the isotherm data amounted to 60% of the retention obtained in the held. Owing to the high flow conditions in the second year, the decrease in the loading of P in the field was decisively lower than estimated.

AB The aim of the present study was to use the analysis of surface water chemistry to understand vegetation succession pathways in terrestrializing polyhumic lakes. We hypothesized that Sphagnum mire development was accompanied by a decrease in the mineral content in water. A total of 111 vegetation plots along 23 transects were analysed in 11 lakes and adjacent peat lands in the Wigry National Park (NE Poland). The vegetation of the lake-mire systems forms distinct zones: (1) nymphaeid-, bladderwort- and bryophyte-dominated aquatic vegetation; (2) sedge-dominated edge of the Sphagnumcarpet; (3) quaking, extremely poor fen with various Cyperaceae; (4) non-quaking, Eriophorum vaginatum-dominated bog-like vegetation and (5) pine woodland. Surface water corrected conductivity (ECcorr.), pH, COD-KMnO4 and Ca2+, Mg2+, Fetot. and SiO2 were measured along the transects. The environmental gradients best explaining the observed pattern were pH (with the highest values in the lake and the lowest in the bog-like vegetation) and COD-KMnO4 (showing an inverse direction). At least in some Sphagnummires conditions were more minerotrophic than in the lakes. The process of humic lake overgrowing by Sphagnum-mires in NE Poland results in pine woodlands on mineralised peat. The climate conditions in NE Poland, combined with evapotranspiration accelerated by encroaching trees, do not seem to support the development of ombrotrophic bogs.

AB 1. Cut-over peatlands cover large surfaces of high potential value for enhancing biodiversity and carbon sequestration if successfully restored. Unfortunately, evaluation of restoration success is not straightforward. We assessed the bioindicator value of organic matter (OM), testate amoebae (protozoa) and bacteria in peat from two regeneration stages and a reference site of a cut-over bog.
   2. Contrasting biochemical signatures of peat OM were observed along the regenerating profiles, allowing clear differentiation between the newly regenerated peat and the old peat. Where peat macrofossils were absent sugar biomarkers were used to infer peat botanical origin and OM alteration.
   3. Over the succession, the OM composition of the new peat differed. Peat from the more recent stage was dominated by Sphagnum-derived tissues and characterized by lower carbohydrate preservation and higher bacterial biomass than the advanced regeneration stage.
   4. Surface testate amoeba communities also changed from the recent to the advanced stages of regeneration, indicating a shift from wet and moderately acidic conditions to drier and more acidic conditions. Over this regeneration sequence (i) the biomass and average size of species declined but were higher at the unexploited site and (ii) species richness and diversity increased but density declined.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Although secondary succession in the cut-over bog led to an ecosystem similar to that of the reference site in terms of surface vegetation, OM and testate amoebae continued to reflect disturbances associated with peat harvesting. Nevertheless, the described dynamics of both microbial and biochemical variables over the succession showed similarities between the advanced stage and the reference site: a higher testate amoeba diversity was associated with better carbohydrate preservation and a more heterogeneous botanical composition of the peat. The inferred water table depth and pH based on testate amoebae indicators proved to be an alternative approach for assessing restoration processes, in contrast to labour-intensive repeated measurements in the field. The botanical and biochemical composition of peat OM provided additional information on past anthropogenic perturbations of the bog and could be used for restoration monitoring. The combination of several indicators therefore provides a more complete assessment of ecological conditions that could be valuable for the management of cut-over peatlands.

AB Nine years of seasonal delta O-18 values in precipitation, soilwater and groundwater were evaluated in the Uhlirska catchment between 2008 and 2016 and recharge winter/summer ratios were calculated using delta O-18 values. The longterm average O-18 content in groundwater is lower than the mean weighted O-18 content in precipitation. This is explained by more than 50% of winter- and snowmelt-induced groundwater recharge that occurs in all years except of 2010 and 2013. The recharge of the peat organic soil water is balanced between summer and winter, whereas the mineral hillslope soil is dominantly recharged by summer precipitation. The 67% portion of baseflow, dominantly generated in the winter season, is composed of groundwater and peat organic soil water, according to the hydrochemical distribution of runoff components. Isotopic mass balance of individual winters shows that precipitation in warmer winters is entirely transformed into outflow until the end of the winter season, generating no significant water storage for potential drought periods.

AB Effective policies to protect groundwater-dependent ecosystems require robust methods to determine the environmental flows and levels required to support species and processes. Frameworks to support groundwater management must incorporate the relationships between hydrology and species and ecological processes. These hydro-ecological relationships can be used to develop quantitative, measurable thresholds that are sensitive to changes in groundwater quantity. Here we provide a case study from a group of fens in central Oregon, USA, that are used for cattle watering, but also support numerous sensitive species. We developed quantitative relationships between the position of the water table and wetland indicator plant species and the process of peat development, to propose groundwater withdrawal thresholds. A maximum depth to water table of -0.9 to -34.8 cm for fen plants and -16.6 to -32.2 cm for peat accretion can be tolerated in these wetlands. Defining hydro-ecological relationships as thresholds can support management decisions.

AB Vegetation, water table depth and water chemistry of 16 peatlands in the southern Alps, Italy, were analysed in 115 sample plots. A poor-rich gradient could be detected along the first axis of a partial Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Both vegetation and hydrochemistry vary gradually along the gradient. Vascular plants have much broader niches along the gradient than bryophytes. Mosses (except Sphangnum) and hepatics have narrower niches than Sphagnum. The various species of Sphagnum segregate more clearly from each ether along the moisture gradient than along the poor-rich one. The positions of species optima along the latter gradient largely reflect the ecological preferences of mire plants in peatlands with respect to nutrient status.

AB Surface topography of boreal peatlands is frequently hummocky. The hummocks and hollows develop from the peat and remain stable over long periods of time, even while climate and other environmental conditions change. Processes leading to these stable surface forms have not been clearly understood. The HOllow-HUMmock (HOHUM) model provides an explanation of bog microtopography, resilience, and stability. It suggests that bog microtopography results from moss species properties interacting with the physical environment.
   HOHUM is a dynamic, process-based simulation model simulating biological and physical processes leading to hummocks, hollows, and pools in boreal peatlands. It consists of several interacting submodels that grow hummocks and hollows at a monthly time step. Climate is represented by long-term monthly means for a specific location. The hydrology submodel. calculates seasonal water table fluctuations relative to the peat surface. The vegetation submodel grows-Sphagnum mosses using climate and moisture information and generates litter input; and the peat submodel simulates species- and layer-specific peat decay and accumulation. The model tracks the total depth of the top peat layer (acrotelm) of bogs produced by three common species of Sphagnum mosses, one of which forms high hummocks, another forms lower or middle hummock layers, and the third produces hollows.
   Model results indicate that hummocks and hollows arise primarily from species differences expressed through different peat accumulation rates. Interactions among moisture, unique Sphagnum species characteristics, and decomposition rates ate responsible for maintenance and resilience of hummocks and hollows. Feedbacks between Sphagnum growth, decay, and moisture restrict peat accumulation over time, creating a stable equilibrium with local climate Within decades. These feedbacks appear responsible for the long-term maintenance of bog hummocks-and hollows and their adaptation to changing environmental conditions
   Model validation showed excellent agreement (within 2 cm) between predicted and measured heights of hummocks, hollows, and water table depths for North American and European sites, and successfully reproduced conditions not anticipated during model development. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the model is most sensitive to decomposition rates, Sphagnum production rates, peat bulk densities, and the effects of hummock ice retention into the spring. Simulations for 35 northern US and Canadian sites predict distinct bog surface microtopography: hummocks and hollows are well developed in the eastern and northeastern regions of North America-With-the highest hummocks in far northeastern Canada, north of which hummocks grade into low surface relief. In the high-latitude Canadian interior extreme arctic conditions (cold and dry) prevent bog formation. South of the Great Lakes, wet hollow species are replaced by more drought-resistant species to form relatively flat lawns. These simulated geographic patterns agree with those reported for North American peatlands. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Groundwater vulnerability; Groundwater management; Drainage;

ID RESTORATION; MANAGEMENT
AB In the Boreal region, anticline eskers aquifers are recharged in upland hillslopes and water discharges in the surrounding lowlands. Organic peat soils often confine the aquifer discharge area and drainage of these confining peat layers can decrease the flow resistance in the peat soil, which may cause unintentional groundwater level drawdown. This poses a risk to groundwater bodies and their good water status in the Boreal region. To increase awareness of the risk areas and to assess potential areas for drainage restoration, a model based on geographical information systems (GIS) was developed to predict the locations of high groundwater discharge. The output of the model is a map highlighting the potential areas where groundwater is more likely to discharge. The model output was validated with stream flow data collected from two eskers located in Finland. The developed GIS model is recommended as a tool to delineate groundwater protection areas where drainage of the peat soil should not be allowed and for assessing areas where such drainage networks could be restored to protect vulnerable groundwater systems.

AB Testate amoebae are now commonly used in paleoenvironmental studies but little is known of their taphonomy. There is some experimental evidence for differential preservation of some testate amoeba shell types over others, but it is unclear what, if any impact this has on palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. To investigate this issue we looked at palaeoecological evidence for the preservation of different shell types. We then investigated the possible impact of selective preservation on quantitative palaeoenvironmental inference. We first used existing palaeoecological data sets to assess the vertical patterns of relative abundance in four testate amoeba shell types: (1) shells made of secreted biosilica plates (idiosomes, e.g. Euglypha), (2) idiosomes with thick organic coating (Assulina), (3) proteinaceous shells (e.g. Hyalosphenia), (4) shells built from recycled organic or mineral particles (xenosomes) (e.g. Difflugia, Centropyxis). In three diagrams a clear pattern of decay was only observed for the idiosome type. In order to assess the implications of differential preservation of testate amoeba taxa for paleoenvironmental reconstruction we then carried out simulations using three existing transfer functions and a wide range of scenarios, downweighting different test categories to represent the impact of selective test decomposition. Simulation results showed that downweighting generally reduced overall model performance. However downweighting a shell type only produced a consistent directional bias in inferred water table depth where that shell type is both dominant and shows a clear preference along the ecological gradient. Applying a scenario derived from previous experimental work did not lead to significant difference in inferred water table. Our results show that differential shell preservation has little impact on paleohydrological reconstruction from Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. By contrast, for the minerotrophic peatlands data-set loss of idiosome tests leads to consistent underestimation of water table depth. However there are few studies from fens and it is possible that idiosome tests are not always dominant, and/or that differential decomposition is less marked than in Sphagnum peatlands. Further work is clearly needed to assess the potential of testate amoebae for paleoecological studies of minerotrophic peatlands.

DT Article
DE bog hydrology; discharge; peat bog; runoff; streamflow; water-balance
AB The problem considered here is: how to measure the discharge from a raised min in terrain that is only partly mire-covered. The approach involves comparison of the stream discharge from a mixed mire and mineral-soil sub-catchment with that from a neighbouring non-mire sub-catchment. Inconclusive results have previously been obtained using naturally occurring chemical tracers, and the validity of an alternative area-separation method is now examined.
   Estimates of the mire component of discharge derived in this way and summed over periods of 7-12 days agree to within 1 mm day(-1) with estimates of mire discharge obtained by two other methods, namely direct measurement using mire lysimeters, and water-balance calculations using on-site rainfall measurements and evapotranspiration data calculated using the Penman-Monteith formula. The area-separation method may, therefore, be a useful adjunct or alternative to more expensive chemical methods for studying both the water yield of mixed catchments and aspects of peatland hydrology.

AB This study examined the hydrological conditions and water balance of a tall hummock in Fuhrengawa mire for 2 years. We clarified the hydrological processes by which Sphagnum can survive on hummocks of a mixed mire. Surface-layer water content was almost constant irrespective of continuous sunny days and heavy-rain days. Water content of deeper layers and the overall water level fluctuated more widely. Estimates of water balance showed that an almost identical amount of water that was lost to evapotranspiration was re-supplied from deeper layers to the surface on sunny days. Conversely, during rainy periods, rainwater rapidly infiltrated through unsaturated layers to deeper layers. Thereby, some fraction of the rainwater was stored in deeper layers or as groundwater. These water movements are attributable to the physical properties of Sphagnum peat, which forms hummocks. During our 2-year observation, precipitation was 1.1-1.5 times higher than the evapotranspiration. The longest period without rainfall was 11 days. Such a frequent and abundant rainwater supply, which exceeds evapotranspiration loss, maintains wet conditions and quantitative predominance of rainwater in hummocks. Accordingly, Sphagnum hummocks in the Fuhrengawa mire maintain their wet and ombrotrophic conditions because of the physical properties of peat and humid climate. Sphagnum survives because of these suitable conditions for growth. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB We present the results of high-resolution, multi-proxy palaeoecological investigations of two parallel peat cores from the Baltic raised bog Mechacz Wielki in NE Poland. We aim to evaluate the role of regional climate and autogenic processes of the raised bog itself in driving the vegetation and hydrology dynamics. Based on partly synchronous changes in Sphagnum communities in the two study cores we suggest that extrinsic factors (climate) played an important role as a driver in mire development during the bog stage (500-2012 CE). Using a testate amoebae transfer function, we found exceptionally stable hydrological conditions during the last 2000 years with a relatively high water table and lack of local fire events that allowed for rapid peat accumulation (2.75 mm/year) in the bog. Further, the strong correlation between pH and community-weighted mean of testate amoeba traits suggests that other variables than water-table depth play a role in driving microbial properties under stable hydrological conditions. There is a difference in hydrological dynamics in bogs between NW and NE Poland until ca 1500 CE, after which the water table reconstructions show more similarities. Our results illustrate how various functional traits relate to different environmental variables in a range of trophic and hydrological scenarios on long time scales. Moreover, our data suggest a common regional climatic forcing in Mechacz Wielki, Gazwa and Kontolanrahka. Though it may still be too early to attempt a regional summary of wetness change in the southern Baltic region, this study is a next step to better understand the long-term peatland palaeohydrology in NE Europe.

AB Low affinity methanotrophic bacteria consume a significant quantity of methane in wetland soils in the vicinity of plant roots and at the oxic-anoxic interface. Estimates of the efficiency of methanotrophy in peat soils vary widely in part because of differences in approaches employed to quantify methane cycling. High resolution profiles of dissolved methane abundance measured during the summer of 2003 were used to quantity rates of upward methane flux in four peatlands situated in Wales, UK. Aerobic incubations of peat from a minerotrophic and an ombrotrophic mire were used to determine depth distributions of kinetic parameters associated with methane oxidation. The capacity for methanotrophy in a 3 cm thick zone immediately beneath the depth of nil methane abundance in pore water was significantly greater than the rate of upward diffusion of methane in all four peatlands. Rates of methane diffusion in pore water at the minerotrophic peatlands were small (<10%) compared to surface emissions during June to August. The proportions were notably greater in the ombrotrophic bogs because of their typically low methane emission rates. Methanotrophy appears to consume entirely methane transported by pore water diffusion in the four peatlands with the exception of 4 of the 33 gas profiles sampled. Flux rates to the atmosphere regardless are high because of gas transport through vascular plants, in particular, at the minerotrophic sites. Cumulative rainfall amount 3-days prior to sampling correlated well with the distance between the water table level and the depth of 0 mu mol l(-1) methane, indicating that precipitation events can impact methane distributions in pore water. Further work is needed to characterise the kinetics of methane oxidation spatially and temporally in different wetland types in order to determine generalized relationships for methanotrophy in peatlands that can be incorporated into process-based models of methane cycling in peat soils.

AB Landfills and tailing impoundments contain barrier layers that prevent the migration of contaminants into groundwater by slowing down the water flow through the structures. Many materials used in hydraulic barrier layers also have sorption properties, which could be utilized to reduce environmental risks. The adsorption of Ni(II) and Cd(II) on peat was studied using a single metal column test. Two samples with different dry unit weights, low-density (LD) and high-density (HD) peat, were tested. A batch test was made for comparison. Both samples in the column test adsorbed the metals well; peat adsorbed 9,500mg/kg of nickel and 11,200mg/kg of cadmium. The adsorption was twice as high in the column test as in the batch test. Cadmium adsorbed strongly on the top layers of the sample, whereas the adsorption profile of nickel was more even through the sample. The density of the peat did not affect the maximum adsorption capacity. In HD peat, the heavy metals adsorbed more on the top layers of the sample, and in LD peat, the metals migrated deeper. In a hypothetical field impoundment, the liquid/solid ratio of the column experiment would represent a time period of 38-59years and the structure would adsorb 99% of both metals. A 50-cm layer of HD peat would have the capacity to adsorb 1.96kg of cadmium and 1.66kg of nickel per square meter.

AB Global warming and the resultant increase in evapotranspiration might lead to lowered water tables in peatlands and an increase in fire frequency. The objective of this study was to investigate some of the potential effects of these changes on peat decomposition. Dry mass losses and emissions of CO2 and CH4 from peat samples taken from three depth layers (0-10, 10-20, and 30-40 cm) of a black spruce peatland were measured in the laboratory at 8-degrees, 16-degrees, and 24-degrees-C under two moisture treatments. Effects of deep peat fire on decomposition were also simulated by burning the upper layer (0-10 cm) of peat and adding the ash to peat samples from the 10-20 cm layer. CH4 release averaged < 1% of total carbon loss in flooded samples. Release of CO2 was 4-9 times greater from the 0-10 cm layer than from the 30-40 cm layer. After 120 d, the 30-40 cm layer had lost < 1% of its original dry mass in all treatments. Higher temperatures strongly promoted decomposition of samples exposed to drying cycles but had little effect on decomposition of continuously flooded samples. Ash addition had variable effects on CO2 emissions but may have promoted CH4 production.
   It is suggested that in certain situations, global warming may not cause appreciable increases in carbon loss from peat deposits. The results indicate that some deeper peats are resistant to decay even when exposed to warm, aerobic conditions. However, further experimental work is needed to predict the long-term response of peat deposits to changes in water levels in different peatland types.

AB Sphagnum peatlands are threatened at a global scale, not only by peat extraction, but also by Sphagnum harvesting. In Chile, dry Sphagnum moss is mainly exported for use as substrate for horticulture and orchids. Although the use of Sphagnum within Chile is limited, there are no data about its productivity and growth. These peatlands have a special microtopography with hummocks, hollows and lawns, which vary the distance of moss to the water table level. In these ecosystems, the water table is almost all year near the surface. We measured cumulative and relative growth rates and productivity during approximately one annual cycle in private Sphagnum peatlands that are being yearly harvested for commercial purposes. We evaluated the relationship between Sphagnum magellanicum growth and productivity with microtopography and water table depth. Productivity, cumulative and relative growths were higher in lawns than in hummocks. Overall and relative growth of S. magellanicum showed a negative relationship with depth of the water table. There were also differences between sites, some of them showed high growth rates, but low productivity. Sphagnum extraction in Chile, is now at low scale, but the growing international market demands constitute a real threat to the resource.

   The objective of this study was to evaluate natural forest regeneration in cutovers on drained fens (eutrophic and mesotrophic low moor peat soils) depending on intensity of drainage characterised by depth of the ground water table, coverage of ground by vegetation and soil chemical properties (soil acidity and saturation with bases). The data were collected in 172 sample plots established in transects located perpendicular to drainage ditches at different distance to it. The assessments were carried out in 2003-2007 in the Panevezys and Birzai state forest enterprises.
   It was found that downy birch (Betula pubescens) seedlings dominated in cutovers on eutrophic and mesotrophic fens. The density of seedlings was greatest (3,700-5,300 trees per ha) on undrained and extensively drained cutovers where ground water table depth (h(5)) at the beginning of growth period was 1-20 cm. Black alder (Alnus glutinosa) seedlings were most abundant (1,000-1,300 trees per ha) in undrained and extensively drained cutovers on eutrophic peatlands where ground water level at the beginning of growth period is above the soil surface (10 cm) or near it (in the depth of 1-10 cm). Spruce (Picea abies) seedlings were not abundant (averaged 300 101 trees per ha) in these sites. The higher density of spruce seedlings was found (more than 300 trees per ha) in drained cutovers (h(5) = 10-80 cm) on mesotrophic peatlands.
   It was found that the average density of seedlings of trees in cutovers on fens (eutrophic peatlands) depended significantly on the depth of the ground water table, coverage of ground vegetation and acidity of soils.It was concluded that overly intensive drainage of fens (lowering ground water table at the beginning of the growth period of trees by more than 30-40 cm) created unfavourable conditions for regeneration of trees, decreased the base saturation of soil, increased soil acidity and reduced soil fertility.

AB In rich fens, unlike bogs, the key drivers structuring testate amoeba communities are related to nutrient status, suggesting the potential for transfer functions to quantitatively reconstruct changing nutrient status from palaeoecological records. Such records could be useful tools to investigate the long-term impacts of pollution and landscape change. Here, we derive and test transfer functions for pH, water-table depth, conductivity and Ca and Mg concentrations using a data set from Polish fens. Results show that transfer functions for Ca and conductivity have apparent predictive power for surface samples; these models will require further validation and testing with palaeoecological data. Testate amoeba transfer functions for fen nutrient status may be a valuable addition to the peatland palaeoecologist's tool-kit, although further work will be required to demonstrate their usefulness in practice.

ID PEATLAND
AB Peatlands do not readily return to functional wetland ecosystems after harvesting (cutting), because the harsh hydrological and microclimatic conditions are unsuitable for Sphagnum regeneration. In this study, drainage ditches blocked after harvesting restored the water balance to a condition similar to a nearby natural bog. Evaporation averaged 2.9 and 2.7 mm day(-1) on the cutover and natural bog, respectively. Evaporation consumed most of the rainfall input (86 and 80%, respectively), whereas runoff was minor at both sites (6 and 4%, respectively). However, the water table position was markedly different at these sites. Median water table depth was 0.05 m below the surface in the natural bog, compared with 0.44 m in the cutover bog (ditches blocked). Changes to the peak soil matrix owing to drainage and cutting reduced the specific yield (Sy) of the peat to 0.04-0.06 from 0.35-0.55, causing exaggerated water table changes in the cutover site. Nevertheless, volumetric soil moisture in the cutover site (0.67 +/- .08) had low variability, and was maintained above moisture contents found in Sphagnum hummocks in the natural bog (0.48 +/- .10), although less than on Sphagnum lawn(0.84 +/- .11). Poor Sphagnum regeneration on cutover surfaces can therefore be attributed to its inability to extract water from the underlying peat, which retains water at matric suction greater than the nonvascular Sphagnum can generate.
   The corrupted iron pan under main ditches has permitted partial recharge of the underlying aquifer, reducing local hydraulic gradients, thereby decreasing vertical seepage loss.

   Complex Floodplain Wetland, Norfolk Broads, UK
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Catfield Fen lies on the floodplain of the River Ant,-adjacent to Barton Broad, a flooded 13th century peat cutting in East Anglia, England. There are few studies of the hydrology of floodplain mires so this paper presents the results of a study of the surface and groundwater components of a fen system within the Norfolk Broads region. The study was undertaken as part of a larger study (Gilvear et al., 1993; Gilvear et al., 1994) to ascertain the sensitivity of East Anglian fen systems to groundwater abstraction and pollution. Catfield Fen is a surface-water-dominated system maintained primarily by precipitation and flows to and from the river system. Upward groundwater flows from the Pleistocene Crag aquifer through a discontinuous clay layer to the fen and hillslope inputs also contribute nutrient rich waters to the wetland. Different areas of the marsh receive varying contributions of flow from these various sources so that spatial variations occur in surface water chemistry. The fen is hydrologically complex because a number of open drainage ditches, cut across its surface, act as preferential pathways for water movement. Part of the fen is effectively isolated from direct inundation from riverine flooding by a small embankment; thus defines an 'internal compartment' for which a tentative overall water balance is calculated. Both the drainage ditches and the embankment have modified surface and groundwater flows locally but have not altered the overall hydrological functioning or the water balance of the natural wetland system. The groundwater flow modelling demonstrates the sensitivity of the fen to groundwater abstraction. The results of the overall study suggest firstly that the site is complex and vulnerable to both surface and groundwater abstraction and pollution and secondly demonstrate the complexity and difficulty of investigations of the hydrology of floodplain mires.

AB The majority of peatlands in the temperate zone is subjected to drainage and agricultural land use and have been found to be anthropogenic emission hot spots for greenhouse gases. At the same time, many peatlands receive increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition by intensive agricultural practices. Here we provide eddy covariance measurements determining net ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange at a protected but moderately drained ombrotrophic bog in Northwestern Germany over three consecutive years. The region is dominated by intensive agricultural land use with total (wet and dry) atmospheric N deposition being about 25kgNha(-1)yr(-1). The investigated peat bog was a small net CO2 sink during all three years ranging from -9 to -73gCm(-2)yr(-1). We found temperature- and light-dependent ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross primary production, respectively, but only weak correlations to water table depths despite large interannual and seasonal variability. Significant short-term effects of atmospheric N deposition on CO2 flux components could not be observed, as the primary controlling factors for N deposition and C sequestration, i.e., fertilization of adjacent fields as well as temperature and light availability, respectively, exceeded potential interactions between the two.

AB This study compares seasonal and spatial variations in methane fluxes as sources of uncertainty in regional CH4 flux upscaling from the wetlands of West Siberia. The study examined variability in summertime CH4 emissions from boreal peatlands, with a focus on two subtaiga fen sites in the southern part of West Siberia (Novosibirskaya oblast). We measured CH4 flux, water table depth, air and peat temperature, pH and electric conductivity of peat water during three field campaigns in summer 2011 (9-12 July, 26-28 July and 20-21 August). Fluxes were measured with static chambers at sites chosen to represent two of the most widespread types of wetlands for this climatic zone: soligenous poor fens and topogenous fens. In both sites the water table level acts as the primary control on fluxes. For the poor fen site with good drainage, water table controls CH4 fluxes on the seasonal scale but not on a local spatial scale; for the fen site with weak drainage and microtopographic relief, the water table controls fluxes on the local spatial scale, but does not drive seasonal variations in the flux magnitude. This difference in hydrology shows the necessity of including detailed wetland type classification schemes into large-scale modeling efforts. From these three measurement periods, we estimated the relative seasonal variation in CH4 emissions as 8% for the fen site and 26% for the poor fen site. These results were compared to estimates of other sources of uncertainty (such as interannual variation and spatial heterogeneity) to show that quantifying seasonal variability is less critical than these other variations for an improved estimate of regional CH4 fluxes. This research demonstrates and ranks the challenges in upscaling measured wetland CH4 fluxes across West Siberia and can guide future field campaigns.

AB The study was carried out in a raised bog located in the Kamanos state reserve in northwestern Lithuania (56 degrees 16'N, 22 degrees 39'W). The area of the raised bog is 1722 ha. To assess the effect of meteorological factors and damming of drainage ditches oil the water regime of the Kamanos mire, we have analysed the water table depth fluctuations over the last 22 years in the northern part of the mire. which was drained out in 1907, and the drainage ditch was dammed in 1999. The control plots were established in the central part of the raised bog without draining activities, where Eriophorum vaginatum-Sphagnum spp. communities prevail in the ground vegetation and small Scots pine trees may also be found.
   The results showed that, in both natural and damaged-by-drainage sites of the raised bog, the air moisture deficiency and the amount of precipitation had a significant effect oil the fluctuation Of the water table depth during the growth period (R(2) = 0.4 16 - 0.761 p < 0.05). In comparison with the control plots, in 7 years after establishing dams in a 0.9-1.2 in deep ditch, the groundwater table increased by 9.8 to 12.2 cm in the area up to 980 in apart from the ditch, After damming the ditches in the extensively and intensively drained parts of the raised bog, the levelling out of the water table to a similar depth as in the control plots, occurred within 4 years and is forecasted to occur within 12 years, respectively. The water table of the drained sites of the raised bog was more sensitive to increasing annual temperatures than the water table in the undrained sites of the raised bog.

AB The ecology of peatland testate amoebae is well studied along broad gradient from very wet (pool) to dry (hummock) micro-sites where testate amoebae are often found to respond primarily to the depth to water table (DWT). Much less is known on their responses to finer-scale gradients, and nothing is known of their possible response to phenolic compounds, which play a key role in carbon storage in peatlands. We studied the vertical (0-3, 3-6, and 6-9 cm sampling depths) micro-distribution patterns of testate amoebae in the same microhabitat (Sphagnum fallax lawn) along a narrow ecological gradient between a poor fen with an almost flat and homogeneous Sphagnum carpet (fen) and a "young bog" (bog) with more marked micro-topography and mosaic of poor fen and bog vegetation. We analyzed the relationships between the testate amoeba data and three sets of variables (1) "chemical" (pH, Eh potential, and conductivity), (2) "physical" (water temperature, altitude, i.e., Sphagnum mat micro-topography, and DWT), and (3) phenolic compounds in/from Sphagnum (water-soluble and primarily bound phenolics) as well as the habitat (fen/bog) and the sampling depth. Testate amoeba Shannon H' diversity, equitability J of communities, and total density peaked in lower parts of Sphagnum, but the patterns differed between the fen and bog micro-sites. Redundancy analyses revealed that testate amoeba communities differed significantly in relation to Eh, conductivity, water temperature, altitude, water-soluble phenolics, habitat, and sampling depth, but not to DWT, pH, or primarily bound phenolics. The sensitivity of testate amoebae to weak environmental gradients makes them particularly good integrators of micro-environmental variations and has implications for their use in paleoecology and environmental monitoring. The correlation between testate amoeba communities and the concentration of water-soluble phenolic suggests direct (e.g., physiological) and/or indirect (e.g., through impact on prey organisms) effects on testate amoebae, which requires further research.

AB Two mathematical models using MODFLOW software were developed to estimate water losses from the bogged Lake Rekyva watershed which are happening due to the groundwater recharge and to evaluate the influence of peat deposit development on the lake and the natural belt of a raised bog protecting the lake. The modelling data lead to the following conclusions: (1) groundwater exploitation in the Siauliai waterworks would increase the water losses from the boggy basin negligibly (from 7 to 9 mm/a when the total runoff is over 150 mm/a (2) the annual and long-term runoff and water level regimes in the raised bog, that separates the peat deposit from the lake as a 3 km long and 0.26 to 0.8 m wide belt, are rather variable. Depending on the season, from 80 to 95% of the runoff from it is formed in the 0.3-0.5 m thick top layer (acrotelm) distinguished by anomalously good filtration properties and porosity; (3) at the end of the peat deposit exploitation, the discharge from the protective bog to the lake presumably will reduce by 0.2-0.4 l/s (about 1% of the total lake runoff) and that from the bog to the peat deposit will increase by about 0.5 l/s (depending on the season, 1-15% of the total runoff from the bog); and (4) seasonal recharge of acrotelm is capable of counterbalancing the loss therefore the status of protective bog will remain close to the actual one.

AB The Oostriku peat bog (central Estonia) has been exposed to metal-rich groundwater discharge over a long period of time and has accumulated high concentrations of Fe (up to 40 wt-%), heavy metals (e.g. Ph, Zn, Mn, Cu), and As. In this study, the peat was characterised with respect to composition and metal content with depth. The peat pore water was analysed and compared to a spring water emerging at the site. Sequential extraction, using a Tessier scheme optimised for iron-rich sediments, was used to understand the relative roles of binding mechanisms involved in the retention of different metals in the peat. Significant difference in depth distribution was found between different metals bound in the peat, which was partly attributed to varying compositions of the peat with depth and different dominant binding mechanisms for different metals.

Discolouration depth was highly correlated with positions of highest and lowest water tables; estimates were systematically biased but generally within 5 cm of measured values.
   2. The annual range in water-table position indicated by discolouration depth varied 10-fold along a 30 m transect. Discolouration of PVC tape is an indicator of reducing conditions that could be applied in extensive surveys at very low cost.

ID EH MEASUREMENTS
AB At the groundwater-surface-water interface the last modification of discharging groundwater takes Place. In this study the redox potential was measured in situ in four groundwater discharge areas with a size of 3-4 m2. Three of them were the upper reaches of streams in coniferous forests and one was an alder fen. Measurements were made at different seasons, with 50 and 100 platinum micro-electrodes respectively, in each area. Readings were taken in the upper 30 cm of the soil, at two depths.
   A method study showed that the electrodes needed a longer equilibrium time than is usually reported. The main finding of this study was the large spatial variation within soils in the discharge zone; regions as small as 10 cm in diameter could have redox potentials covering several hundred mV. It was not possible to identify a seasonal variation due to the large spatial variation. Differences in the distribution of the redox potential with depth may be explained by the structure of the peat affecting flow patterns and the residence time of water.

AB Coastal zones connect terrestrial and marine ecosystems forming a unique environment that is under increasing anthropogenic pressure. Rising sea levels, sinking coasts, and changing precipitation patterns modify hydrodynamic gradients and may enhance sea-land exchange processes in both tidal and non-tidal systems. Furthermore, the removal of flood protection structures as restoration measure contributes locally to the changing coastlines. A detailed understanding of the ecosystem functioning of coastal zones and the interactions between connected terrestrial and marine ecosystems is still lacking. Here, we propose an interdisciplinary approach to the investigation of interactions between land and sea at shallow coasts, and discuss the advantages and the first results provided by this approach as applied by the research training group Baltic TRANSCOAST. A low-lying fen peat site including the offshore shallow sea area on the southern Baltic Sea coast has been chosen as a model system to quantify hydrophysical, biogeochemical, sedimentological, and biological processes across the land-sea interface. Recently introduced rewetting measures might have enhanced submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) as indicated by distinct patterns of salinity gradients in the near shore sediments, making the coastal waters in front of the study site a mixing zone of fresh- and brackish water. High nutrient loadings, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved organic matter (DOM) originating from the degraded peat may affect micro- and macro-phytobenthos, with the impact propagating to higher trophic levels. The terrestrial part of the study site is subject to periodic brackish water intrusion caused by occasional flooding, which has altered the hydraulic and biogeochemical properties of the prevailing peat soils. The stable salinity distribution in the main part of the peatland reveals the legacy of flooding events. Generally, elevated sulfate concentrations are assumed to influence greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, mainly by inhibiting methane production, yet our investigations indicate complex interactions between the different biogeochemical element cycles (e.g., carbon and sulfur) caused by connected hydrological pathways. In conclusion, sea-land interactions are far reaching, occurring on either side of the interface, and can only be understood when both long-term and event-based patterns and different spatial scales are taken into account in interdisciplinary research that involves marine and terrestrial expertise.

AB South Park is a high-elevation, semi-arid, treeless intermountain basin in central Colorado. A few extreme rich fens occur on the western margin and in the center of South Park where regional and local groundwater flow systems discharge to the ground surface. Over the past 40 years there has been extensive peat mining in these fens, but restoration methods have yet to be developed and successfully applied. The first part of this study compared the naturally reestablished vegetation on six mined peatlands with six pristine sites, while the second part of the study tested different revegetation techniques in 27 plots with varying depths to the water table. The six mined sites had only 30 plant species as compared with 122 species in the unmined sites; 43% of the species in the mined sites were not present in the undisturbed fens. Even after 40 years the sedges and willows that dominate the undisturbed sites were largely absent on the mined sites. The revegetation experiments seeded eight species, transplanted Carex aquatilis (water sedge) seedlings, transplanted rhizomes from six species, and transplanted four species of willow cuttings. Of the eight species seeded, only Triglochin maritima (arrowgrass) germinated and established seedlings. C. aquatilis seedlings, rhizome transplants of C. aquatilis, Kobresia simpliciuscula (elk sedge), and Juncus arcticus (arctic rush), and willow cuttings all had differing patterns of survival with respect to the annual maximum height of the water table. These results indicate that the dominant species can be successfully reintroduced to mined surfaces with the appropriate hydrologic conditions, but human intervention will be necessary to rapidly re-establish these species. The slow rate of peat accumulation means that restoration of the mined fens will require hundreds, if not thousands, of years.

AB Stable isotope compositions of mercury (Hg) were measured in the outlet stream and in soil cores at different landscape positions in a 9.7-ha boreal upland-peatland catchment. An acidic permanganate/persulfate digestion procedure was validated for water samples with high dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations through Hg spike addition analysis. We report a relatively large variation in mass-dependent fractionation (delta Hg-202; from -2.12 to -1.32 parts per thousand) and a smaller, but significant, variation of mass independent fractionation (Delta Hg-199; from -0.35 to -0.12 parts per thousand) during two years of sampling with streamflow varying from 0.003 to 7.8 L s(-1). Large variations in delta Hg-202 occurred only during low streamflow (<0.6 L which suggest that under high streamflow conditions a peatland lagg zone between the bog (3.0 ha) and uplands (6.7 ha) becomes the dominant source of Hg in downstream waters. Further, a binary mixing model showed that except for the spring snowmelt period, Hg in streamwater from the catchment was mainly derived from dry deposition of gaseous elemental Hg (73-95%). This study demonstrates the usefulness of Hg isotopes for tracing sources of Hg deposition, which can lead to a better understanding of the biogeochemical cycling and hydrological transport of Hg in headwater catchments.

TI Numerical testing of conceptual models of groundwater flow: a case study

SO SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY

DT Article
ID SCOTLAND
AB The current understanding of the groundwater flow regime in the Dumfries Basin aquifer has been developed over a number of years and encapsulated in a conceptual model. A numerical modelling study has been undertaken to test the confidence in this understanding. This study has included three activities: recharge estimation, water balance calculations and steady-state groundwater flow modelling. It has been confirmed that the highest recharge is found in the NW of the basin and that the peat and marine clay deposits limit direct recharge in the east and south. The water balance is dominated by surface water flow, in particular the River Nith brings over 3200 Ml day(-1) onto the basin. Conceptualized flow directions were confirmed by the steady-state modelling. The understanding and model validity are severely constrained by a lack of flow data in the lower River Nith and scarcity of water level and aquifer property information. These knowledge gaps could be filled by flow gauging just above the tidal limit of the river and additional drilling and testing.

AB In this article, we examined the indicative value of a relationship between two non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs), fungal HdV-10, related to the presence of Calluna vulgaris, and HdV-31A, which is testate amoeba - Archerella flavum. Both are frequently present on slides designated for pollen analysis, prepared from Sphagnum peat. We analysed three profiles from three extensive ombrotrophic peatlands in northern Poland, in which the content of testate amoebae (TA) was examined and TA-inferred depth to the water table (DWT) was reconstructed. The new analysis of palynological samples regarding NPPs revealed that strong increases in HdV-10 content were mostly simultaneous to HdV-31A declines. However, the relations between both types were not statistically significant. The rapid increases in HdV-10, despite the fact that this type of conidiospores is related to drier habitats on peatlands, were tentatively interpreted as an indicator of rapid rises in the water table level which, in consequence, might have stimulated the production of these spores by fungi. In addition, a negative correlation between HdV-31A and Arcella discoides and positive one, but weaker, in case of HdV-10 (attributed by some authors to species Trichocladium opacum (Corda) S Hughes) and A. discoides show a link between mutual fluctuations of both NPPs and hydrological instabilities on peatland. The Bagno Kusowo bog, the westernmost peatland subjected to the study, displayed an intriguing agreement between the presence of peat sections with strong increases in HdV-10 and cold climate events affecting Europe. Our study reveals that counting even a limited number of NPP types during the standard pollen analysis of Sphagnum peat may support the interpretation of results, especially, in cases when the investigation lacks testate amoeba analysis. When the reconstruction of TA-inferred DWT is provided, it may introduce additional information about the patterns of hydrological dynamics.

AB Open cut drains are the most frequently used drainage technique in peatlands and are common throughout the world. Land drains increase the drainage density and promote enhanced coupling of hillslope sediment sources with streams. They may be major sources of fine sediment to peatland stream systems but data on drain sediment production in peatlands are rare. Many drains are now being dammed by humans, yet some revegetate naturally. This paper presents a survey of the erosion and natural revegetation of peat drains related to variables such as slope, drainage area and shading. The paper also provides measured comparison of sediment flux from open drains, drains that have been blocked by peat dams, undisturbed subcatchments, and the catchment outlet. Natural infilling of drains was often found to occur on gentle slopes < 4 degrees. Drains on slopes < 2 degrees were rarely eroded, while drains on slopes > 4 degrees were rarely infilled. Nick-point retreat at the confluence of drains was often observed. Revegetation of drains was uncommon where drains have been cut or incised into the underlying mineral substrate. Where the drain floor was peat-based, revegetation was much more common. Revegetation of drain floors was affected by overhanging vegetation, which provided shading. Drain floors with less than 60% shading tended to have a greater vegetation cover than drains with 60-90% shading. However, drains that were almost totally shaded (> 90%) had the greatest floor vegetation. The intact drains were found to be major sources of suspended sediment within the survey catchments, with 18 center dot 3% of the sediment originating from the unblocked drains which drained 7 center dot 3% of the area. The winter quarter of the year was more important than other seasons for producing suspended sediment, even though precipitation totals were not greatest during this period. Drains which had been dammed at intervals along their length using peat blocks had very low sediment yields. Even poorly dammed drains, where water could still flow along the full course of the drain, had 54 times less suspended sediment production than unblocked drains.

AB Continuous water-table (WT) measurements from peatlands are scarce and - if existing at all-very short. Consequently, proxy indicators are critically needed to simulate hydrological changes in peatlands over longer time periods. In this study, we demonstrate that tree-ring width (TRW) records of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) growing in the Cepkeliai peatland (southern Lithuania) can be used as a proxy to reconstruct hydrological variability in a raised bog environment. A two-step modelling procedure was applied to extend existing measurements and to develop a new and longer peatland WT time series. To this end, we used instrumental WT measurements extending back to 2002, meteorological records, a P-PET (difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) series covering the period 1935-2014, so as to construct a tree-ring based time series of WT fluctuations at the site for the period 1870-2014. Strongest correlations were obtained between average annual WT measured at the bog margin and total P-PET over 7 years (r = 0.923, p < 0.00001), as well as between modelled WT and standardized TRW data with a two years lag (r = -0.602, p < 0.001) for those periods where WT fluctuated at the level of pine roots which is typically at <50 cm depth below the peat surface. Our results suggest that moisture is a limiting factor for tree growth at peatlands, but below a certain WT level (<50 cm under the soil surface), drought becomes a limiting factor instead. To validate the WT reconstruction from the Cepkeliai bog, results were compared to Nemunas river runoff since CE 1812 (r = 0.39, p < 0.00001, 1870-2014). We conclude that peatlands can act both as sinks and sources of greenhouse gases in case that hydrological conditions change, but that hydrological lags and complex feedbacks still hamper our understanding of several processes affecting the hydrology and carbon budget in peatlands. We therefore call for the development of further proxy records of water-table variability in peatlands to improve our understanding of peatland responses to climatic changes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Despite the many studies about peatland development and carbon dynamics in China, especially for Zoige peatlands on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, few apply modeling as an effective approach to study peatland development. In order to fill up the knowledge gaps of China alpine peatland development and to provide a comparison with previous research, we studied the Zoige peatlands in Holocene with a modeling approach.
   Simulated results were obtained by the Holocene peatland model (HPM). Driving data was reconstructed based on paleoclimate studies. Model calibration and performance index validation were done by comparing the model output with literature data about peat age depth.
   Based on our results, the peat cohort mass mean accumulation rate was 0.45 mm year(-1) (ranging from 0.38 to 0.50 mm year(-1)). The mean C accumulation rate was about 0.026 kg C m(-2) year(-1) (ranging from 0.023 to 0.029 kg C m(-2) year(-1)), with a peak accumulation rate around 7 ka to 6 ka BP during the Holocene. The peat depth was 5.38 m (ranging from 4.6 to 5.99 m). The total peat storage in Zoige was about 1.76 Pg (ranging from 1.58 to 2.29 pg), and the carbon stock was estimated as 0.432 pg C (ranging from 0.348 to 0.479 pg C) in Zoige peatlands during the Holocene. After model calibration and validation, simulated results indicated that peat development and carbon accumulation were controlled by variation of water table depth (WTD).
   Simulated results indicated that the Zoige peatlands are the most important component of peatlands in China in terms of carbon stock. Though HPM lacks in driving data of temperature and incomplete climate factors, its limitations in the parameter setting should not offset the added value of the modeling approach in improving our understanding of peatland carbon and their controlling factor dynamics at the long-term scales in the Zoige region where there are very few studies so far.

AB The limestone country of the eastern Burren includes permanent lakes, extensive fens, and turloughs-depressions characterised by large fluctuations in water levels that become dry in summer and have distinctive vegetation. Most of the larger lakes lie on an almost level surface, draining southwards via the River Fergus into the Shannon estuary; Lough Bunny drains through the limestone north towards Galway Bay. Field evidence indicates that the lakes and fens, whether they flood in winter or not, have a relatively constant summer water level, probably because the underlying limestone is sealed by glacial drift. Their vegetation follows a normal hydrosere succession from open-water deposits (mostly calcareous marl) to reed swamp and Schoenus fen, culminating locally in raised bog. Present-day exposed expanses of marl are products of erosion of a former peat cover. Turloughs are characterised by unconstrained fluctuations of the water level through most or all of its vertical range. They occur where there is no barrier at the surface to drainage into the limestone, but there is sufficient hydraulic resistance to underground flow to allow water levels to rise during winter and after heavy rain. The vegetation of typical turloughs has more in common with dune slack or flood meadow communities than with true fens.

AB Identifying the mechanisms that drive development of self-organized patterned landscapes is essential for guiding ecosystem management and restoration. In this work, we modeled flow through real and geostatistically simulated landscapes to test the hypothesis that feedbacks between patch anisotropy and hydroperiod may be sufficient to explain development of the flow-parallel ridge-slough mosaic of the Everglades (Florida, USA). Results show patch anisotropy to be a strong predictor of hydroperiod, with ecologically significant increases in flooding duration (> 40 days/year) in isotropic landscapes compared with areas of the Everglades with the best-conserved anisotropic patterning. Notably, hydroperiod differences among landscapes were largest in dry years, suggesting that low flow periods may be most influential in landscape pattern development, contrary to alternative models of pattern formation. This study demonstrates the potential for coupled feedbacks between landscape geometry and hydrology to drive anisotropic pattern formation via inundation frequency without requiring velocity-driven erosion and redistribution of particulates.

AB The A >> abieniec kettle hole is the first peatland in central Poland analyzed quantitatively with four biotic proxies (plant macrofossils, pollen, testate amoebae and chironomids) to reconstruct the past environmental change. Palaeoecological data were supported by historical and archaeological records. We focused on autogenic vegetation change and human impact in relation to climatic effects. The aims of our study were (a) to describe the development history of the mire during the last 2,000 years, (b) to date and reconstruct the anthropogenic land-use changes and (c) to discuss a possible climatic signal in the peat archive. The combination of proxies revealed dramatic shifts that took place in the peatland since the Roman Period. A >> abieniec was a very wet telmatic habitat until ca. AD 600. Then, the water table declined, and the site transformed into a Sphagnum-dominated mire. This dry shift took place mainly during the Early Medieval Period. Human impact was gradually increasing, and it was particularly emphasized by deforestation since AD 1250 (beginning of the Late Medieval Period). Consequently, surface run-off and aeolian transport from the exposed soils caused the eutrophication of the mire. Furthermore, chironomids and testate amoebae reveal the beginning of a wet shift ca. AD 1350. Openness considerably increased in the Late Medieval and the Modern Periods. The highest water table during the last 1,000 years was recorded between AD 1500 and 1800. This wet event is connected with deforestation, but it could be also associated with the Little Ice Age. Our study shows plant succession in the A >> abieniec peatland, which can be explained with the recent landscape transformation. However, such changes are also possibly linked with the major climatic episodes during the last two millennia, such as the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age.

AB Interpretation of proxy-climate records depends on a thorough understanding of the proxyclimate relationship. Peatland surface wetness records have been interpreted as reflecting changes between cool and/or wet conditions and warm and/or dry conditions. This paper analyses a high-resolution record of reconstructed water-table changes based on testate amoebae analysis in relation to instrumental weather records Since AD 1775. Replicate peat records are reconciled by multiple chronological techniques and tuning, and demonstrate that the reconstructions preserve many replicable high-frequency changes. Water-table variability is highly correlated with the total seasonal moisture deficit (precipitation evapotranspiration, P-E) expressed as the sum of all months with negative P-E. The reconstructed water-table record reflects antecedent periods of 5 or 10 years (maximum r(2) = 52.4%) and proxy bog surface wetness records can therefore be interpreted as reflecting the length and intensity of the summer water deficit period. Response surfaces of the summer deficit in relation to temperature and precipitation variability support the hypothesis that the summer deficit is determined by summer precipitation in mid-latitude oceanic peatlands and that summer temperature plays a greater but still subsidiary role in higher latitude, continental settings. These relationships apply for all plausible past Holocene climate changes and future twenty-first century climate scenarios. Non-linear responses to longer-term climate states prevent the direct application of a calibration of the reconstructed water-table records to infer quantitative estimates of climate variables. Models that combine peat accumulation, mire growth and hydrological processes are required to undertake this task.

AB A peat core from the Barschpfuhl kettlehole mire in north-east Germany was analysed for multiproxy indicators (plant macrofossils, pollen/non-pollen microfossils, testate amoebae, colorimetric humification, carbon/nitrogen ratios, bulk density, loss on ignition), to investigate the effects of climate change and human impact on vegetation and peat accumulation during the last c. 300 years. C-14 wiggle-match dating was applied for high-precision dating. Testate amoebae assemblages were used to reconstruct past water table depths and compared with other proxies and instrumental climate data from the mid-18th century onwards. The mire hydrology of this relatively small bog was heavily influenced by forestry changes in the area. The climate signal was therefore obscured. Afforestation with fast-growing conifers and drainage for agricultural purposes resulted in a lowering of the water level, changes in trophic status, changes in mire surface vegetation and increased decomposition of the peat. Variations in the openness and cultivated land indicators in the pollen data of Barschpfuhl reflect regional population density and land use changes. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Northern peatlands store similar to 30% of the global soil carbon, despite covering only 3% of the land. To understand the carbon balance of these systems and predict their response to changes in climate, robust and reliable models are needed. The McGill Wetland Model (MWM), originally developed to simulate the carbon dynamics of ombrotrophic bogs, was modified to simulate the CO2 biogeochemistry of sedge-dominated oligotrophic minerogenic peatlands, a prominent peatland type in boreal and subarctic landscapes. Three modifications were implemented: (1) a function to describe the impact of soil moisture on the optimal gross primary production, (2) a scheme to partition the peat profile into oxic and anoxic compartments based on the effective root depth as a function of daily sedge net primary production, and (3) a function to describe the fen moss water dynamics. The modified MWM was evaluated using eddy-covariance net ecosystem production (NEP) from Degero Stormyr in northern Sweden. The root mean square error for daily NEP was similar to 0.46g C m(-2) d(-1), and the index of agreement was 84%. This model adequately captures the magnitude and direction of the CO2 fluxes and simulates the seasonal and inter-annual variability reasonably well (r(2)>0.8). Sensitivity analysis confirms that specifically water table depth (WTD) and moss water content are key biogeochemical hydrology processes for the carbon biogeochemistry of a sedge-dominated oligotrophic minerogenic peatland. An increase of WTD by 15cm or air temperature by 3 degrees C could decrease NEP by up to 200% and make the peatland become a source of CO2.

AB Peatland development occurs naturally over long periods of time in response to climate, geology, hydrology and vegetation. Open-pit oil sands mining activities in Northern Alberta result in large-scale removal of the surficial landscape, which comprises many (similar to 50%) peatlands, approximately 90% of which are fens with a wide range of peat thicknesses (<1 m to similar to 5 m). Recently, the concept of peatland creation was adapted into the regulatory framework. Two experimental fen peatlands have now been constructed on post-mining landscapes in order to test the design implications and implementation methods and to develop knowledge to advance the concept. These two systems were guided by different conceptual approaches: one utilized numerical modelling for landscape optimization, while the other attempted to mimic the landscape position of natural fen systems (and supported the design with numerical modelling). Both system designs attempt to accelerate succession by adding peat substrate (0.5 m and 2 m) and revegetating, with the belief that the system will stabilize within decades as opposed to millennia. This paper provides an overview of the feasibility of peatland creation, from a primarily hydrologic perspective, and addresses the complexity of determining whether these projects can be deemed a success.
   Future landscape design plans could benefit from a change of perception of the role of peatlands in the landscape. This change should involve a shift away from viewing wetlands as landforms constrained to low-lying areas within the reclaimed landscape, and towards recognizing that peatlands can function as both a sink and source of water to the remainder of the catchment. Wetland interconnectivity within the reconstructed landscape could increase water detention and storage during wet periods, which would benefit both the wetlands and the forestlands during dry periods. The assessment of the success of these constructed systems should be a reflection of our ability to correctly and accurately predict the influence of external forcings (e.g., climate) on the processes operating within a newly constructed system. Short timeframes (similar to 5 years) are sufficient to characterize a range of processes operating in the constructed ecosystems; however, longer time periods will reduce uncertainty in the assessment of the system's successional pathway. The design of future constructed fen peatlands must employ an adaptive approach that assimilates the knowledge developed in the current research and the information attained over the longer-term to guide the design of future fen systems.

AB Drainage has turned peatlands from a carbon sink into one of the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG) sources from cultivated soils. We analyzed a unique data set (12 peatlands, 48 sites and 122 annual budgets) of mainly unpublished GHG emissions from grasslands on bog and fen peat as well as other soils rich in soil organic carbon (SOC) in Germany. Emissions and environmental variables were measured with identical methods. Site-averaged GHG budgets were surprisingly variable (29.2 +/- 17.4 t CO2-eq. ha(-1)yr(-1)) and partially higher than all published data and the IPCC default emission factors for GHG inventories. Generally, CO2 (27.7 +/- 17.3 t CO(2)ha(-1)yr(-1)) dominated the GHG budget. Nitrous oxide (2.3 +/- 2.4kg N2O-N ha(-1)yr(-1)) and methane emissions (30.8 +/- 69.8kg CH4-C ha(-1)yr(-1)) were lower than expected except for CH4 emissions from nutrient-poor acidic sites. At single peatlands, CO2 emissions clearly increased with deeper mean water table depth (WTD), but there was no general dependency of CO2 on WTD for the complete data set. Thus, regionalization of CO2 emissions by WTD only will remain uncertain. WTD dynamics explained some of the differences between peatlands as sites which became very dry during summer showed lower emissions. We introduced the aerated nitrogen stock (N-air) as a variable combining soil nitrogen stocks with WTD. CO2 increased with N-air across peatlands. Soils with comparatively low SOC concentrations showed as high CO2 emissions as true peat soils because N-air was similar. N2O emissions were controlled by the WTD dynamics and the nitrogen content of the topsoil. CH4 emissions can be well described by WTD and ponding duration during summer. Our results can help both to improve GHG emission reporting and to prioritize and plan emission reduction measures for peat and similar soils at different scales.

AB Few water budgets exist for specific types of wetlands such as peatlands, even though such information provides the basis from which to investigate linkages between wetlands and upland ecosystems. In this study, we first determined the water budget and then estimated nutrient loading from an upland farm field into a 1.5 ha, kettle-block peatland. The wetland contains highly anisotropic pest and has no distinct, active layer of groundwater flow. We estimated the depth of the active layer using Fick's law of diffusion and quantified groundwater flow using a chemical mass balance model. Evapotranspiration was determined using MORECS, a semi-physical model based on the Penman-Monteith approach. Precipitation and surface outflow were measured using physical means. Groundwater provided the major inflow, 84 percent (44,418 m(3)) in 1993 and 88 percent (68,311 m(3)) in 1994. Surface outflow represented 54 percent (28,763 m(3)) of total outflows in 1993 and 48 percent (37,078 m(3)) in 1994. A comparison of several published water budgets for wetlands and lakes showed that error estimates for hydrologic components in this study are well within the range of error estimates calculated in other studies. Groundwater inflow estimates and nutrient concentrations of three springs were used to estimate agricultural nutrient loading to the site. During the study period, nutrient loading into the peatland via groundwater discharge averaged 24.74 kg K ha(-1), 1.83 kg total inorganic P ha(-1), and 21.81 kg NO3-N ha(-1).

AB Low water tables typically found in peatlands during dry summer periods or in the vicinity of drainage ditches may lead to moisture deficiency in porous surface peats. Episodes of drought stress might compromise the growth benefits brought about by lower ground-water levels. We examined the water relations of black spruce (Picea mariana) trees on a natural peatland during relatively wet (1990) and relatively dry (1991) summers. Seasonal patterns of pre-dawn and mid-day shoot water potentials and stomatal conductance were not related to peat water content or to water-table depth. There was no evidence of water stress or osmotic adjustment in sampled trees during wet and dry growing seasons. Our soil moisture data showed that although water-table levels were as low as -66 cm in 1991, water availability in the root zone remained high. Even with the absence of mid-day water stress during the summer of 1991, a 50% reduction in stomatal conductance as compared with the previous year was found. We suggest that signals from the bulk of the roots located in dry peat top layer contributed to the regulation of stomatal conductance.

TI Peatland initiation in Central European Russia during the Holocene:
   Effect of climate conditions and fires
SO HOLOCENE

DT Article
DE basal peat dates; Holocene; peat inception; radiocarbon datasets;
   wildfires
AB Peatlands store massive amounts of organic carbon, but the fate of this carbon remains unclear as global climate continues to warm. The age of peatland inception and the main drivers of peat initiation are one of the most important issues in Holocene paleoecology, especially for the numerous but under investigated peatlands in European Russia. This paper introduces new peatland initiation ages for 44 mires in three areas located in the central part of European Russia within the Polesie landscape belt. This region is characterised by waterlogged sandy plains and flat surface topography. Phases of peatland initiation were compared with Holocene fire regime derived from macro-charcoal data as well as with regional climatic reconstructions. We found that peat inception in the region started around 12,000 cal yr BP, but the most active phases of peatland initiation took place during the periods 8500-7500, 7000-6000, 5300-5800, 4000-3500 and 1700-1200 cal yr BP. Expect for rapid peat growth during the early Holocene, peatland initiation mostly coincided with warm climatic periods and increased fire frequency. Forest soil paludification in poorly drained Polesie landscapes was presumably enhanced by reduced evapotranspiration and changes in water balance due to disturbance of forest cover after wildfires. We expect that rising air temperature in the current century will cause higher fire frequencies and may encourage waterlogging of forests and ecosystem transformation.

AB The wetlands of the James Bay Lowland comprise one of largest wetland complexes in the world, in part due to the properties (thickness and hydraulic conductivity) of the marine sediment (MS) that underlay them. Dewatering of an open-pit diamond mine is depressurizing the surrounding Silurian bedrock below the MS. Prior to mining, it was assumed that these MS would largely isolate the overlying peatlands from the depressurized regional bedrock aquifer. To assess this isolation, we instrumented a 1.5km long transect of wells and piezometers located within the zone of the mine's influence that crossed a sequence of bogs, fens, and bedrock outcrops (bioherms). Results were differentiated between those areas with no MS (near bioherms) and those underlain by MS (non-bioherm) along the transect. Between 2007 and 2010 at near-bioherm and non-bioherm locations, average peat water tables declined 71 and 31cm, and hydraulic head declined 66 and 32cm, in bioherm and non-bioherm locations, respectively. Gradients varied from near zero (-0.001) at the start of dewatering to -0.03 (after 5years) in non-bioherm areas and from -0.20 to -0.45 in near-bioherm areas. These gradients corresponded to fluxes (groundwater recharge) of approximately -0.26mm/day and -2.1mm/day, in non- and near-bioherm areas, respectively. Specific discharge (recharge) determined using the known mine dewatering rate and drawdown cone heads and areas corresponded well with measured recharge determined in the non-bioherm transect locations. A simple rearrangement of Darcy's Law used to calculate the specific discharge highlighted how the ratio of hydraulic conductivity to the thickness of the MS can be used to assess vulnerable areas. Therefore, given the increasing development in Ontario's Far North, considerable attention must be given to both the thickness and hydraulic conductivity of MS.

AB Peatland practitioners and scientists have increasingly recognised the damage resulting from various management methods, and the need to restore peatlands to achieve several potential benefits. Many of the hoped-for benefits of peatland restoration, such as Carbon storage, biodiversity conservation and water quality improvements, are thought to depend on a reinstatement of high water tables that had been reduced by drainage. Despite the current emphasis on restoring drained peatlands, many of the predicted responses to restoration are still not adequately proven and the mechanisms behind them still uncertain. This study reports on water table and discharge responses to drain blocking restoration of a degraded Welsh upland blanket bog. Restoration work and monitoring were designed to permit a novel catchment scale control-intervention experimental design. An information theoretic approach to examining the data provided evidence of increases in water retention and water tables within the bog after restoration. But the study also demonstrated the importance of small and large scale topography in determining the degree of these responses. The increases in water storage after restoration produced lower discharge rates observable at the level of both drains and hill streams; as well as greater water table stability, reduction in peak flows and increases in water residency after rainfall. Crucially, this study showed strong catchment scale differences in response, and a very gradual recovery of water tables, both of which highlight the need for more studies to be carried out at the landscape scale and over longer time periods.

AB The developmental stages, hydrological conditions, and net peat accumulation rates at three coring sites of Pare de Frontenac Peatland (Quebec) were reconstructed to examine the role of climate on pent accumulation. During the early to mid-Holocene, elevated temperatures proved to be a more critical factor for sustained peat production than precipitation, because peatland development occurred mostly under a dry climate according to a low lake-level stage lasting from 11000 to 7000 calibrated (cal.) BP in a nearby lake. Between 7000 and 6000 cal, BP, elevated net pent accumulation rates roughly correspond with a rise in lake water level, suggesting that higher precipitation and (or) less evapotranspiration then favored peat growth. A decrease in peat accumulation occurred from 5000 to 2500-1500 cal. BP, while the lake level was high from 4400 cal. BP. An important increase in net pent accumulation rate is recorded for this entire peatland from 1500 cal. BP. Lack of close timing between fake level changes and changes in pent accumulation rates or surface hydrology suggest that temperature and autogenic processes were often more important than regional water balance in the developmental history of the peatland.

AB Peatlands are important to global carbon (C) sequestration and surface water acid-base status, both of which are affected by peatland alkalinity and acidity cycling. Relationships among sulfate (SO4 (2-)), nitrate (NO3 (-)), organic acids (OA(-)), base cations (i.e., Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na+), proton (H+) acidity, and bicarbonate (HCO3 (-)) alkalinity were investigated in an intermediate fen peatland in northern Ontario during 2004 (an average precipitation year) and 2005 (a dry summer). Potential evapotranspiration was higher and the water table, groundwater input from the uplands, and runoff were lower during 2005. Net inputs of base cations, HCO3 (-), SO4 (2-), and OA(-), and to a lesser degree NO3 (-), were lower during the drier year, mainly due to lower groundwater transfer to the fen. Fen porewater HCO3 (-) concentration and net output were also lower in the drier year, whereas Ca2+, Mg2+, and SO4 (2-) concentrations and net output were higher. During the climatically average year, N immobilization, carbonic acid (H2CO3) dissociation, and OA dissociation were equally important H+-producing reactions. Peat cation exchange accounted for 50% of the H+ sink, while SO4 (2-) reduction and denitrification accounted for an additional 20 and 25% of the H+ sink, respectively. During the dry year, S oxidation accounted for 55% of the H+ net production, while that for H2CO3 dissociation was 70% lower than that during the climatically average year. Peat cation exchange consumed three times the acidity, and accounted for 92% of the H+ consumption during the dry year compared to the climatically average year. This was consistent with a three-fold higher net base cation export from the fen during the dry year. Based on the study results, a conceptual model was developed that describes the role of acidity formation and its implications to intermediate fen acidification.

AB A 0.05 km2 patterned bog and a 0.29 km2 ribbed fen were compared to determine the influence of their morphometry on runoff and evapotranspiration.  The bog hydrology was dominated by irregularly located and poorly linked pools less-than-or-equal-to 1.0 m deep, separated by prominent ridges containing local water-table maxima.  This small basin had an appreciable lag-to-peak time (e.g. 6 h), and a low runoff ratio (0.1 to 0.2), because of the large depression storage of the pools, and a long detention storage caused by the weak pool-to-pool linkage.  The ribbed fen was dominated by a 1.3 km water track, which consisted of shallow pools (less-than-or-equal-to 0.25 m deep), separated by low ridges that did not produce local water table maxima.  The pools were well linked, but their sequential arrangement resulted in a very large detention storage which trimmed the runoff ratio to only 0.003 to 0.07.  The lag-to-peak time was relatively short (approx. 3h), because of sheet flow in the lower water track, just above the weir.  The large depression and detention storage of both systems enhanced evapotranspiration losses.  Between July 5 and August 14, 1990, evapotranspiration from the bog was 97 mm, compared to 126 mm from the fen, while runoff was only 12 and 28 mm for the bog and fen, respectively.  Evapotranspiration from ridges was 67 and 84% of pool evaporation, in the bog and fen respectively.

AB As natural sources of methane (CH4), peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Climate models predict that evapotranspiration will increase under a 2 x CO2 scenario due to increased temperatures leading to lowered water tables at many northern latitudes. Given that the position of the water table within a peatland can have a large effect on CH4 emissions, climate change may alter the CH4 emissions from peatlands in this area. Research was conducted during 2001-2003 on natural and drained (8 years prior) sites within a poor fen in central Quebec. Flux measurements were made for each site at different microtopographical features that varied in depth to water table and vegetation cover. The quantity of CH4 dissolved in the pore water was measured in the field and the potential of the peat for CH4 production and consumption was determined in the laboratory. Methane emissions and storage were lower in the drained fen. Growing season CH4 emissions at the drained site were 55% lower than the control site, primarily due to significantly reduced fluxes from topographic highs (up to 97% reduction), while the flux from topographically low areas remained high. The maintenance of high fluxes at these hollow sites was related to hydrological and ecological effects of the water table drawdown. The removal of standing water removed a potential zone of CH4 oxidation. It also enabled plant colonization at these locations, leading to an increase in gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP). At the hollow sites, seasonal CH4 emissions were significantly correlated to seasonal GEP (R-2 = 0.85). These results suggest that the response of northern peatland CH4 dynamics to climate change depends on the antecedent moisture conditions of the site. Moreover, ecological succession can play an important role for determining future CH4 emissions, particularly from wetter sites.

AB Recent climate change has reduced the spatial extent and thickness of permafrost in many discontinuous permafrost regions. Rapid permafrost thaw is producing distinct landscape changes in the Taiga Plains of the Northwest Territories, Canada. As permafrost bodies underlying forested peat plateaus shrink, the landscape slowly transitions into unforested wetlands. The expansion of wetlands has enhanced the hydrologic connectivity of many watersheds via new surface and near-surface flow paths, and increased streamflow has been observed. Furthermore, the decrease in forested peat plateaus results in a net loss of boreal forest and associated ecosystems. This study investigates fundamental processes that contribute to permafrost thaw by comparing observed and simulated thaw development and landscape transition of a peat plateau-wetland complex in the Northwest Territories, Canada from 1970 to 2012. Measured climate data are first used to drive surface energy balance simulations for the wetland and peat plateau. Near-surface soil temperatures simulated in the surface energy balance model are then applied as the upper boundary condition to a three-dimensional model of subsurface water flow and coupled energy transport with freeze-thaw. Simulation results demonstrate that lateral heat transfer, which is not considered in many permafrost models, can influence permafrost thaw rates. Furthermore, the simulations indicate that landscape evolution arising from permafrost thaw acts as a positive feedback mechanism that increases the energy absorbed at the land surface and produces additional permafrost thaw. The modeling results also demonstrate that flow rates in local groundwater flow systems may be enhanced by the degradation of isolated permafrost bodies.

AB Permafrost degradation associated with a warming climate is second only to wildfires as a major disturbance to boreal forests. Permafrost temperatures have risen to 4 degrees C since the "Little Ice Age", resulting in widespread thawing of permafrost. The mode of permafrost degradation is highly variable, and its topographic and ecological consequences depend on the interaction of slope position, soil texture, hydrology, and ice content. We partitioned this variability into 16 primary modes: (1) thermokarst lakes from lateral thermomechanical erosion; (2) thermokarst basins after lake drainage; (3) thaw sinks from subsurface drainage of lakes; (4) glacial thermokarst of ice-cored moraines; (5) linear collapse-scar fens associated with shallow groundwater movement; (6) round isolated collapse-scar bogs from slow lateral degradation; (7) small round isolated thermokarst pits from surface thawing; (8) polygonal thermokarst mounds from advanced ice-wedge degradation; (9) mixed thermokarst pits and polygons from initial ice-wedge degradation; (10) irregular thermokarst mounds from thawing of ice-poor silty soils; (11) sinkholes and pipes resulting from groundwater flow; (12) thermokarst gullies and water tracks from surface-water flow; (13) thaw slumps related to slope failure and thawing; (14) thermo-erosional niches from water undercutting of ice-rich shores; (15) collapsed pingos from thawing of massive ice in pingos; and (16) nonpatterned ground from thawing of ice-poor soils. These modes greatly influence how thermokarst changes or disrupts the ground surface, ecosystems, human activities, infrastructure, and the fluxes of energy, moisture, and gases across the land-air interface.

The same treatments were applied in a glasshouse experiment in Neuchatel (Switzerland) in which the water table depth was artificially maintained at 7, 17 and 37 cm below the moss surface. In the held, N assimilation in excess of values in wet deposition occurred in the absence of growth, but varied widely between sites, being absent in Lakkasuo (moss N:P ratio 68) and greatest in Moidach More (N:P 21). In the glasshouse, growth was reduced by lowering the water table without any apparent effect on N assimilation. Total N content of the moss in field sites increased as the mean depth of water table increased indicating growth limitation leading to increased N concentrations which could reduce the capacity for N retention. Greater contents of NH4+ in the underlying peat at 30 cm depth, both in response to NH4NO3 addition and in the unamended cores confirmed poor retention of inorganic N by the moss at Lakkasuo. Nitrate contents in the profiles at Lakkasuo, Moidach More, and Cote de Braveix were extremely low, even in the N10 treatment, but in Mannikjarve, where the mean depth of water table was greatest and retention absent, appreciable amounts of NO3- were detected in all cores. It is concluded that peatland drainage would reduce the capture of inorganic N in atmospheric deposition by Sphagnum mosses.

AB Drained peatland catchments are reported to produce more colored, dissolved organic carbon (DOC)-rich water, presenting problems for potable water treatment. The blocking of peatland drainage ditches to restore the water table is increasingly being considered as a strategy to address this deterioration in water quality. However, the effect of ditch blocking on the potential of DOC to form trihalomethanes (THMs) has not been assessed. In this study, the effect of peat rewetting on pore water DOC concentration and characteristics (including THM formation potential [THMFP]) was assessed over 12 months using peat cores collected from two drained peatland sites. The data show little evidence of differences in DOC concentration or characteristics between the different treatments. The absence of any difference in the THMFP of pore water between treatments suggests that, in the short term at least, ditch blocking may not have an effect on the THMFP of waters draining peatland catchments.

AB Peatlands represent over 90% of Canadian wetlands and are the focus of considerable hydrological and biogeochemical research. Research on evapotranspiration (ET) has shown that it can exceed annual precipitation (P) where there are replenishing flood events. Evaporation from open water ponds in boreal peatlands exceeds ET from vegetated riparian zones by about two times, but surrounding forests can shelter small ponds by reducing turbulence. In an open bog, evaporation was modelled by separating the surface into vascular vegetation, hummock moss and hollow moss surfaces, and showed that vascular plants contribute 60-80% of ET, mosses making up the remainder with hummock mosses dominant over hollows. Runoff from peatlands is enhanced by features ranging from headwater swamps, ice-cored peat plateaus, patchy arctic wetlands and even sections of riverine peatlands. Groundwater fluxes can be quite erratic, and depend on transient properties of the peat that depend on moisture content (e.g., unsaturated hydraulic conductivity) to unsteady saturated hydraulic properties (e.g., hydraulic conductivity, specific yield) caused by peat compression and dilation associated with water storage changes. Surface elevation adjustments can result in a more stable depth to water table, increase evaporation losses, increase methane emission, and attenuate pore-water concentration of contaminants. Research on Canadian peatlands has also made significant methodological advances, including measurement of hydraulic properties of living mosses and peat pore-water and pore dimension characteristics. A considerable multi-annual effort has also been made in evaluating carbon dynamics from Canadian peatlands. Summer moisture availability is important to determining carbon fluxes with some peatlands experiencing enhanced productivity following drought (water table drawdown). Sudden changes in water table elevation promote DOC production and export. Methane bubbles confound hydraulic gradients and flows by creating local pockets of pressure, which are then released episodically when the entrapped gas reaches a threshold content. Canadian peatland hydrology continues to be actively researched in lab, field and modelling studies.

AB Peatland testate amoebae are important indicators of hydrology in fossil studies. The direct quantitative application of this principle has been limited due to a lack of suitable modern data and statistical techniques. This study gives results on the ecological relationships of testate amoebae faunas from Newfoundland, Canada, and explores techniques for modelling the relationship with water table depth. Water table, soil moisture and pH are the dominant influences on species composition in 60 samples from 14 peatland areas. Forty species occurred in > 6 samples and these are used to model the relationship with water table depth. Several models were tested. Tolerance downweighted weighted averaging (WA-Tol), weighted averaging with partial least squares (WA-PLS) and partial least squares (PLS) were assessed by jack-knifed error estimates. WA-Tol out-performed all other models and had an RMSE of 6.32 cm with a maximum bias along the gradient of 5.20 cm. WA-Tol probably performs better because the relatively high tolerance values of some species have less influence on the reconstructed values. A series of good indicator species can be identified on the basis of their narrow tolerances. These are Arcella discoides, Difflugia bacillifera, Nebela carinata, Cryptodifflugia sacculus, Nebela griseola, Nebela marginata, Quadrulella symmetrica, Amphitrema stenostoma, and Sphenoderia lenta. The analyses suggest that accurate quantitative reconstructions of past water tables are possible using these techniques and that experimentation with different models is worthwhile to improve their predictive capacity. In order to avoid problems with poor analogues, reconstructions should be based on larger more comprehensive data sets of modern faunas from a wider region.

AB Perennial pools are common natural features of peatlands, and their hydrological functioning and turnover may be important for carbon fluxes, aquatic ecology, and downstream water quality. Peatland restoration methods such as ditch blocking result in many new pools. However, little is known about the hydrological function of either pool type. We monitored six natural and six artificial pools on a Scottish blanket peatland. Pool water levels were more variable in all seasons in artificial pools having greater water level increases and faster recession responses to storms than natural pools. Pools overflowed by a median of 9 and 54 times pool volume per year for natural and artificial pools, respectively, but this varied widely because some large pools had small upslope catchments and vice versa. Mean peat water-table depths were similar between natural and artificial pool sites but much more variable over time at the artificial pool site, possibly due to a lower bulk specific yield across this site. Pool levels and pool-level fluctuations were not the same as those of local water tables in the adjacent peat. Pool-level time series were much smoother, with more damped rainfall or recession responses than those for peat water tables. There were strong hydraulic gradients between the peat and pools, with absolute water tables often being 20-30 cm higher or lower than water levels in pools only 1-4 m away. However, as peat hydraulic conductivity was very low (median of 1.5 x 10(-5) and 1.4 x 10(-6) cm s(-1) at 30 and 50 cm depths at the natural pool site), there was little deep subsurface flow interaction. We conclude that (a) for peat restoration projects, a larger total pool surface area is likely to result in smaller flood peaks downstream, at least during summer months, because peatland bulk specific yield will be greater; and (b) surface and near-surface connectivity during storm events and topographic context, rather than pool size alone, must be taken into account in future peatland pool and stream chemistry studies.

AB Bog ecosystems are sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance, including drainage and air pollution. Carbon (C) balance measurements to determine the effect of disturbance on bog functioning are laborious; therefore reliable proxies for C fluxes that could facilitate upscaling from single studies to a larger scale would be valuable. We measured peat CO2 emissions (R (s)), CH4 efflux and vegetation characteristics in four bog areas that formed a gradient from pristine to severely disturbed peatlands, affected by drainage, peat mining, alkaline air pollution and underground oil-shale mining. We expected that sites experiencing higher human impact (i.e., the vegetation was more distinct from that of a natural bog) would have higher R (s) and lower CH4 emissions, but differences in peat C emissions between the most disturbed and pristine sites were not significant. Growing period median R (s) ranged from 0.5 to 2.2 g C m(-2) day(-1) for our plots; methane emissions, measured from July to December were an order of magnitude lower, ranging from -5.9 to 126.7 mg C m(-2) day(-1). R (s) and CH4 emissions were primarily determined by water table depth, as was tree stand productivity. Therefore, stand structural parameters could potentially be good indicators of soil C emissions from poorly drained forested bogs.

AB Micro-scale properties of peat pore space and their influence on hydraulic and transport properties of peat soils have been given little attention so far. Characterizing the variation of these properties in a peat profile can increase our knowledge on the processes controlling contaminant transport through peatlands. As opposed to the common macro-scale (or bulk) representation of groundwater flow and transport processes, a pore network model (PNM) simulates flow and transport processes within individual pores. Here, a pore network modeling code capable of simulating advective and diffusive transport processes through a 3D unstructured pore network was developed; its predictive performance was evaluated by comparing its results to empirical values and to the results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. This is the first time that peat pore networks have been extracted from X-ray micro-computed tomography (mu CT) images of peat deposits and peat pore characteristics evaluated in a 3D approach. Water flow and solute transport were modeled in the unstructured pore networks mapped directly from mu CT images. The modeling results were processed to determine the bulk properties of peat deposits. Results portray the commonly observed decrease in hydraulic conductivity with depth, which was attributed to the reduction of pore radius and increase in pore tortuosity. The increase in pore tortuosity with depth was associated with more decomposed peat soil and decreasing pore coordination number with depth, which extended the flow path of fluid particles. Results also revealed that hydraulic conductivity is isotropic locally, but becomes anisotropic after upscaling to core-scale; this suggests the anisotropy of peat hydraulic conductivity observed in core-scale and field-scale is due to the strong heterogeneity in the vertical dimension that is imposed by the layered structure of peat soils. Transport simulations revealed that for a given solute, the effective diffusion coefficient decreases with depth due to the corresponding increase of diffusional tortuosity. Longitudinal dispersivity of peat also was computed by analyzing advective-dominant transport simulations that showed peat dispersivity is similar to the empirical values reported in the same peat soil; it is not sensitive to soil depth and does not vary much along the soil profile.

AB Globally, considerable carbon (C) is stored in soils, particularly in peatlands. These stores play a potentially significant role in atmospheric C-cycle feedbacks, and thus need to be accounted for in global models. However, present global soil models do not accurately represent peat C-stocks and -dynamics; thus, their climate-soil C feedback predictions are questionable. A major shortcoming of current models that are based on the decomposition of soil C pools is the lack of representation of long-term (non-equilibrium) soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation, as peat cohorts, with cohort age information. Whereas C-pool models are commonly 'spun up' to equilibrium over several hundred years using an average climate, in nature, soils actually evolve over many thousands of years with associated changes in litter amounts and quality, which affect SOC accumulation, and hence peat formation. Secondly, peat soils have a unique hydrology, and changes in the water table depth (WTD) of peat are important in regulating SOC turnover, yet current non-cohort C pool models fail to include such dynamic hydrological processes. We have developed an improved peat age-cohort model called MILLENNIA, with a variable WTD driving C-dynamics during Holocene peat accumulation, allowing validation with peat age data and the testing of a realistic WTD-driven peat SOC stock response to climate-change scenarios. Model C-dynamics showed particular sensitivity to water table dynamics through precipitation and runoff, as well as to litter quality and decomposition rates. We show that predicted SOC accumulation and peat ages compare well with observations from a UK peatland site, which is currently (on average) a weak net C source with strong climate sensitivity.

ID AGE CALIBRATION
AB The age and sequence of peat accumulation were investigated at a calcareous fen in northeastern Illinois, USA. The purpose of this study was to identify the processes that form and sustain marl flats, which are areas of marl or tufa substrate within the fen that contain numerous rare plant species. Geomorphic, stratigraphic, and radiocarbon evidence was used to establish the processes and chronology of peat accumulation and erosion adjacent to each marl flat. The age of the base of the peat deposit varies greatly throughout the fen, ranging from 14,679 calibrated years before present (cal. years BP) to nearly modem, indicating that colonization of the sand and gravel substrate by peat occurred throughout the period from the Late Pleistocene to present. Adjacent to one marl flat, trends in basal peat age and thickness show that peat accumulation has progressed laterally inward from both sides, suggesting that the marl flat has been infilling with peat progressively by accumulation at the margins since at least 5,370 cal. years BP or longer. A second marl flat in the fen is surrounded by older, thick peat of differing ages on either edge and is bounded by fresh scarps, indicating that the marl flat currently is expanding laterally by erosion into the preexisting peat blanket. These two examples suggest a continuously repeating process, where erosion of the accumulated peat blanket forms a marl flat, which is later covered by peat accumulation. Trends in basal peat age elsewhere in the fen suggest that other marl flats may have existed in the past that have been completely infilled with peat. This study suggests that marl flat formation is a natural process that has been occurring for millennia, continuously creating habitat for the rare plant species that occupy marl flats. There is no evidence that the marl flats at this site are indicative of anthropogenic disturbance, so that management options for these areas are limited to maintaining the quality and quantity of ground-water discharge that supports both peat formation and erosion.

AB Natural soil pipes are found in peatlands, but little is known about their hydrological role. This paper presents the most complete set of pipe discharge data to date from a deep blanket peatland in Northern England. In a 17.4-ha catchment, we identified 24 perennially flowing and 60 ephemerally flowing pipe outlets. Eight pipe outlets along with the catchment outlet were continuously gauged over an 18-month period. The pipes in the catchment were estimated to produce around 13.7% of annual streamflow, with individual pipes often producing large peak flows (maximum peak of 3.8ls1). Almost all pipes, whether ephemerally or perennially flowing, shallow or deep (outlets>1m below the peat surface), showed increased discharge within a mean of 3h after rainfall commencement and were dominated by stormflow, indicating good connectivity between the peatland surface and the pipes. However, almost all pipes had a longer period between the hydrograph peak and the return to base flow compared with the stream (mean of 23.9h for pipes, 19.7h for stream). As a result, the proportion of streamflow produced by the pipes at any given time increased at low flows and formed the most important component of stream discharge for the lowest 10% of flows. Thus, a small number of perennially flowing pipes became more important to the stream system under low-flow conditions and probably received water via matrix flow during periods between storms. Given the importance of pipes to streamflow in blanket peatlands, further research is required into their wider role in influencing stream water chemistry, water temperature and fluvial carbon fluxes, as well as their role in altering local hydrochemical cycling within the peat mass itself. Enhanced piping within peatlands caused by environmental change may lead to changes in the streamflow regime with larger low flows and more prolonged drainage of the peat.

AB Global peatlands store more carbon than is naturally present in the atmosphere(1,2). However, many peatlands are under pressure from drainage-based agriculture, plantation development and fire, with the equivalent of around 3 per cent of all anthropogenic greenhouse gases emitted from drained peatland(3-5). Efforts to curb such emissions are intensifying through the conservation of undrained peatlands and re-wetting of drained systems(6). Here we report eddy covariance data for carbon dioxide from 16 locations and static chamber measurements for methane from 41 locations in the UK and Ireland. We combine these with published data from sites across all major peatland biomes. We find that the mean annual effective water table depth (WTDe; that is, the average depth of the aerated peat layer) overrides all other ecosystem- and management-related controls on greenhouse gas fluxes. We estimate that every 10 centimetres of reduction in WTDe could reduce the net warming impact of CO2 and CH4 emissions (100-year global warming potentials) by the equivalent of at least 3 tonnes of CO2 per hectare per year, until WTDe is less than 30 centimetres. Raising water levels further would continue to have a net cooling effect until WTDe is within 10 centimetres of the surface. Our results suggest that greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands drained for agriculture could be greatly reduced without necessarily halting their productive use. Halving WTDe in all drained agricultural peatlands, for example, could reduce emissions by the equivalent of over 1 per cent of global anthropogenic emissions.

AB Experiments were performed to assess the nature of solute transport in peat by using step-inputs of a NaCl solution in laboratory columns of undisturbed peat. Feat has a dual-porosity matrix with inter-connected pores that actively transmit water, and dead-end and closed pores formed by the remains of plant cells. The proportion of dead-end and closed pores increased at depth, where the state of decomposition of organic material is more advanced. These dead-end and closed pores act as a sink for solute. Breakthrough at C/C-0 = 0.5 occurred much later than the total active pore volume in the column, indicating that solute retardation occurred. This retardation was attributed to diffusion of the flowing solute into the closed and dead-end pores (matrix diffusion). Greater retardation occurred at depth, increasing from 2.7 at 0.20 m to 7.3 at 0.62 m, corresponding to the greater volume of closed and dead-end pores there. Retardation was also velocity dependent, with higher velocity resulting in less retardation of solute since there was less time available for solute to be abstracted from the flowing water into closed pores. Matrix diffusion was shown to enhance dispersion at lower flow velocities, and dispersion increased with depth. Feat effectively attenuated the conservative solute through matrix diffusion, and heterogeneity in peat properties influenced the effectiveness of this retardation. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB We determined concentrations of major nutrients in the vegetation of six habitat types (hummock, scrub, lawn, fen meadow, hollow and marginal stream), spanning a broad range of environmental conditions as regards water-table depth and water chemistry, in five mires on the southern Alps of Italy. Our study was based on chemical analyses of living tissues of plant species, grouped into growth-form based plant functional types (PFTs). We aimed at assessing to what extent the observed differences in tissue nutrient content were accounted for by community composition (both in terms of species and PFTs) and by habitat. Nutrient concentrations were overall lowest in Sphagnum mosses and highest in forbs, although the latter showed large variations presumably due to heterogeneity in mechanisms and adaptations for acquiring nutrients among species within this PFT. Nutrient content patterns in the other three PFTs varied greatly in relation to individual nutrients, with evergreen shrubs showing low nitrogen (N) concentrations, graminoids showing high N concentrations but low potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg) concentrations and deciduous shrubs showing rather high phosphorus (P) concentrations. Habitat accounted for a modest fraction of variation in tissue concentration of all nutrients except P. We concluded that the nutrient status of mire vegetation is primarily controlled by community composition and structure although habitat does exert a direct control on P concentration in the vegetation, presumably through P availability for plant uptake.

Water-table depth, water pH, electrical conductivity, Ca-, Mg-, K- and Na-concen-trations in soil pore water, shade intensity, and distance from the mire margin were determined at each plot. At mire margins the water table was deeper than in the mire expanse, and K-, Ca- and Mg-concentrations, and conductivity were higher.

AB Forest productivity declines along the transition zones (ecotone) occupying the elevational gradient from upland boreal forest to peatlands. This decline is associated with water table rise and increasing peat depth from upper to lower topographic positions. We hypothesize that in boreal transition zones to poor fens, phosphorus limitations to plant growth are imposed by low pH, rising water table and increasing depth to mineral soil in the waterlogged peat. These phosphorus limitations, together with 02 limitations to root growth, cause sharp decline of productivity down to the fen. The ecosys model was applied to test these hypotheses in a boreal transition zone in central Saskatchewan, Canada. This zone extended from an upland black spruce forest down to a poor forested fen over an organic-mineral soil gradient with peat depth increasing from 60 cm to 160 cm. Model output was compared with field-derived tree carbon stocks, leaf area indexes, and moss net primary productivities at upper, middle, and lower undisturbed ecotone positions. Model results suggest that root contact with mineral soil through shallow peat over a deep water table at the upper ecotone sustained phosphorus uptake and plants did not experience phosphorus limitations. However deep peat and shallow water table towards the fen prevented root contact with mineral soil, imposing phosphorus limitations to plants growing in the poor, acidic peat, causing productivity decline by similar to 75-80%, and tree biomass decline from 6900 to 2100 g Cm-2 in the model vs. similar to 6600 to 800 g Cm-2 observed along the ecotone. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Intact rich fen soil cores with controlled water levels near the surface were installed in an open greenhouse. To simulate short term summer drought, water levels were lowered (20 cm) after two weeks in half of the cores (experimental cores) and remained near the surface in the other half (blanks). After two more weeks, the water levels were brought back to the surface in the experimental cores and remained there for another two weeks. In the blanks, reduction and alkalinization of the top peat layer occurred. In the experimental soil cores oxidation and acidification started within one week after drawdown. An indication for a drought induced rise in soluble reactive phosphorus has been found. The velocity of the acidification process illustrates the dynamic nature of the hydrochemical conditions in fen soils during drought. The processes controlling the acid/base status of rich fen, the effect of drought induced acidification on P availability and the significance for the vegetation are discussed.

AB Close association between hydrology and ecosystem productivity in boreal transition zones requires that modelling ecosystem productivity in these zones be based on accurate modelling of water table dynamics. We hypothesize that these dynamics are driven by transfers of water through surface and lateral boundaries of transition zones, and that lateral transfers can be calculated from hydraulic gradients with external water tables at upper and lower boundaries. In this study we implement these hypotheses in the ecosys model to simulate water table dynamics along a boreal transition zone (ecotone) in central Saskatchewan, Canada, extending from upland black spruce forest down to a poor forested fen. Simulated water table depths were compared to measured values at upper, middle and lower ecotone positions during the dry year 2003 when peat was dried, the very wet year 2004 when peat was rewetted, and the hydrologically average year 2005 when peat remained wet. These hypotheses enabled ecosys to simulate declines in water table depth with declines in elevation along the ecotone that matched well those observed during each of the three years. Observed:expected plots of modelled vs. measured water table depths at all positions indicated reasonable goodness of fit with slopes (with respect to 1:1 line) and R-2 of 0.92 and 0.53 in 2003-2005 period, 0.90 and 0.28 in 2003, 0.81 and 0.51 in 2004, 0.97 and 0.46 in 2005, confirming that our hypotheses enabled changes in water table depths along boreal transition zones to be properly modelled during successively dry, wet and normal years.

AB Annual and seasonal variations in precipitation have been shown to influence the hydrology of nontidal wetlands, including depth to water table. Water-table depth is assessed in wetlands for a variety of reasons, most notably for wetland delineations or determining the success of restoration projects. Many short-term assessment efforts probably occur during periods of abnormal precipitation and, as such, may not provide a thorough understanding of wetland hydrology. I have been evaluating water-table dynamics of a wetlands complex in western North Carolina for seven years in support of a wetlands restoration project. A series of water-table wells and piezometers were installed to determine the spatial and temporal patterns of the water table and vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG). For over three years, the area was classified as having conditions of moderate to severe drought. The drought lowered the average monthly water table by 26 cm in a mountain fen and 22 cm in the adjacent floodplain. The fen was a constant ground-water recharge area before the drought and a discharge area for three of 12 months during the drought. The drought also impacted a shallow, constant ground-water source to the fen on an adjacent hillslope. The impacts of the drought were greater during the active growing season, presumably due to increased evapotranspiration. The results support the need for long-term hydrologic assessment of wetlands and the need to relate wetland hydrology to annual, seasonal, and monthly precipitation patterns.

AB Spatial patterns on a very small scale (10 cm), and the effect of artificial barriers on the composition of phytobenthic algal assemblages along two transects within different microhabitat types were investigated. Samples were taken in a peat bog along linear transects on a scale of 10 cm, and water chemistry was examined. The distribution of algae along both transects was influenced by both spatial distance and environmental conditions in similar proportions. Differences in species composition in various parts of the transects were observed, but this pattern was primarily related to the abundance of species, rather than to their presence/absence in samples. Similarity in species composition correlated with spatial distance and environmental parameters in both microhabitat types. I concluded that, given a homogenous environment on a small scale, spatial distribution of algae is affected by both the environmental conditions of the microhabitats and their dispersal limitations. Moreover, an artificial barrier constituted an obstruction for water and nutrient flow, as well as algal migration, and had an impact on species composition. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Microtopography can have a large effect on flow processes at the soil surface and the composition of soil water. Microtopography is often represented by a roughness parameter in hydrological models. In areas without a strong topographical gradient, microtopography may be underestimated when accumulated in a single parameter, especially in shallow groundwater systems. This study reviews the intricate relationships between microtopography, surface runoff, and ecohydrology in systems featuring shallow water tables. We specifically focus on relations between microtopography and runoff, impact of microtopography on responsetimes of shallow groundwater ecosystems, and microtopography and spatial distribution of groundwater quality parameters and site factors. We advocate the use of microtopography in modeling approaches by examples that feature typical ecosystems with shallow groundwater under influence of microtopography. With a simple modeling approach, we show how microtopography could add flexibility to the acrotelm-catotelm concept in raised bog hydrology. The classic acrotelm-catotelm concept hinders progress in understanding small scale hydrological variations and other ecohydrological relations. Furthermore, we illustrate possible self-organization properties of wetlands. Finally, we show how microtopography and surface runoff affect the mixing of water with different chemical signatures, resulting in variations of the occurrence of plant species.

AB At the ecosystem scale, peatlands can be extremely resilient to perturbations. Yet, they are very sensitive to local disturbances, especially mechanical perturbations (e.g. trampling). The effects of these disturbances on vegetation, and potential effects on hydrochemical conditions along the peat surface, however, are largely unknown.
   We used three research tracks (paths researchers use to access their study sites) differing in time of abandonment to investigate the impact of local disturbance (trampling) on the vegetation and its short-term (<= 2 year) recovery in a flagship research blanket peatland. Additionally, we examined the effects of local disturbance on fluvial runoff events and the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) in runoff water.
   Local disturbance heavily impacted peat vegetation, resulting in large areas of scarred and churned peat. Recovery of vascular plants along abandoned tracks was slow, but a functional Sphagnum layer re-established after just one year.
   The absence of vegetation elicited an increase in the number of runoff events along the tracks, by which POC runoff from the tracks increased. POC concentrations were highest in the surface water from the recently abandoned track, while they were low in the runoff water from the track abandoned longest and the undisturbed control track. We attribute this to the relatively fast recovery of the Sphagnum vegetation. DOC concentrations did not differ significantly either spatially or temporally in surface runoff or soil solution waters. While at an ecosystem scale local disturbances may be negligible in terms of carbon loss, our data points to the need for further research on the potential long-term effects of local disturbance on the vegetation, and significant effects on local scale carbon fluxes. Moreover, the effects of disturbances could be long-lasting and their role on ecosystem processes should not be underestimated. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Descriptions of abiotic properties in bogs are often based on point measurements. To assess whether these point measurements are representative of their surrounding area, depth to water table (DTW), soil moisture, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), the degree of peat humification and ash content were measured at 25 points in a 4 m x 4m study site. The gravimetric moisture content of the peat samples varied little (coefficient of variation (CV): 2-4 %), while the volumetric moisture content (CV: 11 %) and DTW (CV: 48 %) were more variable. Pore water pH also varied little throughout the study site (CV: 1 %), but pore water EC was more variable (CV: 84 %). The degree of humification was generally within 1-2 points on the von Post scale. Ash content was fairly variable (CV: 61-100 %). Plant species composition varied across the study site in relation to microtopography and was, not surprisingly, most strongly influenced by DTW and near-surface soil moisture. Some point measurements in bogs (e.g. pH, gravimetric moisture content) are likely to be representative for an area of at least several square metres, while other variables (e.g. EC, volumetric moisture content, degree of humification, ash content) may need to be measured at more than one point to obtain a representative average.

However, understanding the symbiotic processes governing water and gas exchange is essential to the development of appropriate management plans for peatland restoration. In this paper, we highlight and contrast the suite of processes governing the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon on natural, harvested, and restored peatlands. Evapotranspiration from harvested sites is important throughout the spring and summer, and is not greatly different from the adjacent natural bog. On cutover peatlands, strong capillary water movement compensates for the lack of vascular plants, which on the natural bog become increasingly important as the capillary water movement within drying Sphagnum decreases. Methane emissions from cutover bogs are an order of magnitude lower than in natural sites, however, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are approximately three times greater. Peatland restoration enhances CO2 sequestration, although restoration (at least in the short term) does not restore the net carbon sink function to that in natural bogs. A conceptual model highlighting these changes in the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon from a natural bog through drainage, harvesting, abandonment, and restoration is presented.

AB Afforested peatlands account for about 25 % of human-affected peatlands worldwide. In some regions, particularly the British Isles, forest-to-bog conversions are now underway in the hope of increasing carbon storage and restoring original ecosystem functions. In this study, the effects on surface water quality of forest-to-bog restoration in the Flow Country peatlands of northern Scotland were monitored during 15 months. The hydrochemistry of rainwater, resurgence ground water, forestry drainage ditch water, open bog surface water, forestry-influenced loch water and stream water was examined before, during and after felling. The seasonal cycles of biologically active (C, Si, P) and organically complexed (Fe, Al) elements were characterised by major changes in concentration. The felling operations amplified these effects due to (i) the decomposition of felling residues (leaching K and C) and (ii) the disturbance and partial mineralisation of shallow peat soils (releasing P, Fe and Al). Shorter term changes (1-10 days) produced by rainfall events and associated changes in hydrological flow paths controlled the concentrations of Na, Ca, Mg, Mn, and to a lesser extent K and Al. There were significant negative correlations with flow of [K], [Ca] and [Mg] but a positive correlation between stream flow and [Al]. Concentration-flow relationships were not significantly altered by the felling operations because of the relatively low volume of water released from the felled area. Fluctuations in the water table represented another important control of surface water composition. Resurgence waters produced high [Fe] and [Si] values when water table levels were low. These contributions were diluted with runoff and surface soil waters enriched in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) when levels rose. Sequential ultrafiltration revealed that Fe, C and P co-occurred in the > 30 kDa molecular weight fraction in constant relative concentrations. Since forest-to-bog restoration raises the water table, it can be anticipated to result initially in more intense flushing of DOC, including the > 30 kDa molecular weight fraction where Fe and P co-occur.

AB Peatlands are important ecosystems for biodiversity conservation, global carbon cycling and water storage. Hydrological changes due to climate variability have accelerated the degradation of global and regional ecosystem services of peatlands. Diatoms are important producers and bioindicators in wetlands, but comprehensive diatom-based inference models for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction in peatlands are scarce. To explore the use of diatoms for investigating peatland hydrological change, this study established a training set consisting of diatom composition and twelve environmental factors from 105 surface samples collected from five Sphagnum peatlands in northeastern China. Diatom communities were dominated by Eunotia species. Ordination analyses showed that depth to the water table (DWT) was the most important factor influencing diatom distribution, independently accounting for 4.99% of total variance in diatom data. Accordingly, a diatom-based DWT transfer function was developed and thoroughly tested. The results revealed that the best-performing model was based on weighted averaging with inverse deshrinking (R-2 = 0.66, RMSEP = 8.8 cm with leave-one-out cross validation). Quantitative reconstruction of DWT on a short peat core collected from the Aershan Peatland (Inner Mongolia) recorded climate-mediated hydrological changes over the last two centuries. This study presents the first diatom-water table transfer function in Sphagnum peatlands, and highlights the potential of diatoms as a powerful tool to assess the magnitude of past hydrological changes in peatlands of northeastern China, as well as similar peaty environments worldwide.

AB Niche breadth and niche overlap values for water table depth, pH, conductivity, and base cation concentrations in mire water were calculated for nine Sphagnum species at true nutrient-poor mires in the southern Alps of Italy. Water table depth is more important than chemical status in controlling the distribution of Sphagnum species. The chemical status of mire water is best indicated by water pH. The Sphagnum species occupying the extremes of the water table gradient exhibit narrow niche breadth and a low niche overlap values. For these reasons they are best regarded as specialists. This is particularly evident for hollow species. The sharp segregation of hollow Sphagna along both the water table depth and the chemical gradient is thought to be determined by higher degree of competition taking place in hollow habitats. On the other hand, hummock species appear to be segregated by physiological tolerance rather than competition. The Sphagnum species occupying the middle of the moisture gradient exhibit broad niche breadth and overlap values, brit most of them tend to segregate at least along one of these two gradients.

AB In northeastern Canada, at the ecotonal limit of the forest tundra and lichen woodland, a rise of the regional water table in the peatland systems was registered since Little Ice Age resulting in increasing pool compartment at the expense of terrestrial surfaces. We hypothesized that, with a mean water table closer to peat surface and higher pool density, these ecosystems would be great CH4 emitters. In summers 2009 and 2010, methane fluxes were measured in a patterned fen located in the northeastern portion of the La Grande river watershed to determine the contribution of the different microforms (lawns, hollows, hummocks, string, pools) to the annual CH4 budget. Mean seasonal CH4 fluxes from terrestrial microforms ranged between 12.9 and 49.4 mg m(-2) day(-1) in 2009 and 15.4 and 47.3 mg m(-2) day(-1) in 2010. Pool fluxes (which do not include ebullition fluxes) ranged between 102.6 and 197.6 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) in 2009 and 76.5 and 188.1 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) in 2010. Highest fluxes were measured in microforms with water table closer to peat surface but no significant relationship was observed between water table depth and CH4 fluxes. Spatially weighted CH4 budget demonstrates that, during the growing season, the studied peatland emitted 66 +/- A 31 in 2009 and 55 +/- A 26 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) in 2010, 79 % of which is accounted by pool fluxes. In a context where climate projections predict greater precipitations in northeastern Canada, these results indicate that this type of peatlands could contribute to modify the methane balance in the atmosphere.

AB Testate amoebae assemblages were investigated in the peat deposits of the floodplain terrace swamp located in the southern taiga subzone of Western Siberia. It was revealed that tests of amoebae were well preserved in the minerotrophic peat. Variations in the structure of assemblages show that these bioindicators are sensitive to changes in the environment. The dynamics of the water table depth in the swamp within an 8500-year period was determined according to the analysis of testate amoebae. It reflects the fluctuations of climate humidity during the Holocene.

AB Daily measurements of the water table depth are sometimes needed to evaluate the influence of seasonal water stress on Sphagnum recolonization in restored ombrotrophic peatlands. However, continuous water table measurements are often scarce due to high costs and, as a result, water table depth is more commonly measured manually bimonthly with daily logs in few reference wells. A literature review identified six potential methods to estimate daily water table depth with bimonthly records and daily measurements from a reference well. A new estimation method based on the time series decomposition (TSD) is also presented. TSD and the six identified methods were compared with the water table records of an experimental peatland site with controlled water table regime located in Eastern Canada. The TSD method was the best performing method (R-2 = 0.95, RMSE = 2.48 cm and the lowest AIC), followed by the general linear method (R-2 = 0.92, RMSE = 3.10 cm) and support vector machines method (R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 3.24 cm). To estimate daily values, the TSD method, like the six traditional methods, requires daily data from a reference well. However, the TSD method does not require training nor parameter estimation. For the TSD method, changing the measurement frequency to weekly measurements decreases the RMSE by 16% (2.08 cm); monthly measurements increase the RMSE by 13% (2.80 cm).

AB The installation of green roofs has increased in the world's largest cities in the last 10 yr. Apart from aesthetic aspects, a main objective is to help regulate water fluxes in the urban environment and, under certain conditions, to reduce a building's heating requirements (by increasing thermal resistance) in winter and cooling requirements (by evaporation) in summer. We developed a theoretical approach using relevant thermal properties (heat capacity and thermal conductivity) for substrates being used for green roofs and propose an approach to modeling the interactions between water transport processes and heat flow and exchanges. Substrate water flow (using the van Genuchten approach) and heat flow were simulated for different mixtures of pozzolan and sphagnum peat. The main result was that substrate water retention properties and rain distribution throughout the year were more important for the rain/drainage balance than was substrate thickness. One-dimensional simulations of water and heat transfer at the scale of a few days showed that the overall thermal properties of the substrate were driven by its capacity to store water. While water storage capacity could appear as an advantage for rainwater management in urban areas, it could be a drawback for insulation purposes in winter. In summer, at relatively low water contents, the substrate layer limits sensible heat transfer toward the roof; however, this transfer probably remains much lower than latent heat flow from a green roof to the atmosphere due to evapotranspiration under non-limiting water uptake by plants.

AB The potential aerobic methane oxidation (an estimate of the viable biomass of methane-oxidizing microorganisms) was assessed in various plant communities of a boreal, Sphagnum-dominated, mixed mire in Sweden. The relationships between potential oxidation and probable controlling environmental factors, such as water table depth, soil temperature and pore-water methane concentrations were also examined. Finally, the relationship between potential methane oxidation and the rate of net methane emission was evaluated. Potential methane oxidation ranged between 0.0 and 4.7 mu g CH4 g(-1) wet peat h(-1), and the areal estimates for the 0-40 cm depth interval ranged between 0.04 and 16 g CH4 m(-2) d(-1). The depth of maximal potential oxidation was correlated with the depth of the water table (r(2) = 0.64). Most communities showed a positive relationship between average rate of potential methane oxidation and water table depth (r(2) = 0.66), i.e. the greater the vertical extension of aerated surface peat, the higher the methane oxidation capacity. In non-waterlogged communities (water table more than 5 cm below the vegetation surface), a positive correlation was found between the potential oxidation and methane concentration in peat pore-water (r(2) = 0.44). These results suggest that the supplies of methane and oxygen largely control the biomass of methanotrophs across plant communities. Overall, net methane emission rates were negatively, but only weakly, correlated with the potential oxidation, suggesting that aerobic oxidation often controls emission rates from comparatively dry communities of Sphagnum peatlands, but that other factors also influence the emission.

AB The testate amoeba, ciliate and rotifera communities living in interstitial waters in peatbog in eastern Poland were studied. Sampling was done on a monthly basis from April to November 2007-2008. Microbial communities were examined in a transect including three sites: (1) pine forest (site located 5 m from the lagg/forest contact zone), (2) lagg, (3) open peatbog (the centre of the peatbog). At each of the sites, interstitial water was sampled by means of piezometric wells placed to a depth of 1 m. The species richness and abundance of protozoa and rotifers significantly differed between the studied stations, with the lowest numbers in the pine forest and the highest in the lagg. These differences between macro-habitats may be due to differences in environmental conditions. The distribution of samples in ordination space led to conclude that studied habitats are distributed along the falling gradient of pH and rising gradient of total organic carbon, water table depth and nitrate nitrogen. Assemblages of all three groups showed a strong compositional gradient correlated with water-table depth, conductivity and total phosphorus. However, species composition of ciliates and rotifers was explained by nitrate nitrogen and/or phosphates concentrations. The results suggest that lagg zone of a raised bog can fulfil the function of an ecotone zone, distinguished by a significant increase in biodiversity, abundance and species specificity of micro-organisms. It can also be a place of very efficient matter and energy flow in a peat bog ecosystem.

AB Testate amoebae are an abundant and functionally important group of protists in peatlands, but little is known about the seasonal patterns of their communities. We investigated the relationships between testate amoeba diversity and community structure and water table depth and light conditions (shading vs. insolation) in a Sphagnum peatland in Northern Poland (Linje mire) in spring and summer 2010. We monitored the water table at five sites across the peatland and collected Sphagnum samples in lawn and hummock micro-sites around each piezometer, in spring (3 May) and mid-summer (6 August) 2010. Water table differed significantly between micro-sites and seasons (Kruskal Wallis test, p = 0.001). The community structure of testate amoebae differed significantly between spring and summer in both hummock and lawn micro-sites. We recorded a small, but significant drop in Shannon diversity, between spring and summer (1.76 vs. 1.72). Strongest correlations were found between testate amoeba communities and water table lowering and light conditions. The relative abundance of mixotrophic species Hyalosphenia papilio, Archerella flavum and of Euglypha ciliata was higher in the summer. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding travel times and hydrological pathways of rain and snowmelt water transported through the landscape to recipient surface waters is critical in many hydrological and biogeochemical investigations. In this study, a particle-tracking model approach in Mike SHE was used to investigate the pathway and its associated travel time of water in 14 partly nested, long-term monitored boreal subcatchments of the Krycklan catchment (0.12-68 km(2)). This region is characterized by long and snow-rich winters with little groundwater recharge and highly dynamic runoff during spring snowmelt. The geometric mean of the annual travel time distribution (MTTgeo) for the studied sub-catchments varied from 0.8 to 2.7 years. The variations were related to the different landscape types and their varying hydrological responses during different seasons. Winter MTTgeo ranged from 1.2 to 7.7 years, while spring MTTgeo varied from 0.5 to 1.9 years. The modelled variation in annual and seasonal MTTgeo and the fraction of young water (<3 months) was supported by extensive observations of both delta O-18 and base cation concentrations in the different streams. The travel time of water to streams was positively correlated with the area coverage of low-conductive silty sediments (r = 0.90, P<0 :0001). Catchments with mixed soil-landscape settings typically displayed larger variability in seasonal MTTgeo, as contrasting hydrological responses between different soil types (e.g. peat in mires, till and silty sediments) are integrated. The areal coverage of mires was especially important for the young water contribution in spring (r = 0.96, P<0 :0001). The main factor for this was attributed to extensive soil frost in mires, causing considerable overland flow during the snowmelt period. However, this lower groundwater recharge during snowmelt caused mire-dominated catchments to have longer stream runoff MTTgeo than comparable forest catchments in winter. Boreal landscapes are sensitive to climate change, and our results suggest that changes in seasonality are likely to cause contrasting responses in different catchments depending on the dominating landscape type.

AB Central European mountain bogs, among the most valuable and threatened of habitats, were exposed to intensive human impact during the 20th century. We reconstructed the subrecent water chemistry and water-table depths using diatom based transfer functions calibrated from modern sampling. Herbarium Sphagnum specimens collected during the period 1918-1998 were used as a source of historic diatom samples. We classified samples into hummocks and hollows according to the identity of dominant Sphagnum species, to reduce bias caused by uneven sampling of particular microhabitats. Our results provide clear evidence for bog pollution by grazing during the period 1918-1947 and by undocumented aerial liming in the early 90-ies. We advocate use of herbarized epibryon as a source of information on subrecent conditions in recently polluted mires. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands are important ecosystems for carbon (C) storage, provision of water resources and biodiversity. UK blanket peats represent 10-15% of those found worldwide. While many peatlands continue to be managed through artificial drainage and vegetation burning, it has long been recognized that local habitats and ecological diversity are strongly influenced by these practices. This paper reviews the hydrological, physicochemical and ecological effects of three widespread U K peatland management practices, namely artificial drainage, drain-blocking and rotational heather burning. Drainage and burning of peat often lead to altered runoff regimes, oxidation of organic matter, changes to C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling, and increased metal and suspended sediment concentrations in streams relative to intact peatlands. Although artificial drainage is now rarely implemented on UK upland peats, a great number of historical drains remain, thus drain-blocking is increasingly being applied to restore many peatlands. In contrast, recent increases in the intensity and extent of rotational heather burning may result in further changes to peatland ecosystems. Relatively little is known about the environmental effects of rotational heather burning compared with drainage and drain-blocking management, and for all three of these management techniques there is scarce information on river ecosystem response. We hypothesize some likely effects of basin-scale drainage, drain-blocking and heather burning on stream ecosystems and illustrate these with a schematic model. Such a holistic consideration of peatland river basins is particularly timely with respect to the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive.

TI EFFECT OF INSITU GAS ACCUMULATION ON THE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY OF PEAT
SO SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID WATER; TRANSMISSION; DEPTH; FLOW
AB The in situ hydraulic conductivity of moderately decomposed, catotelm (subsurface) peat is often anomalously low (10(-5) to 10(-7) cm s-1) considering that the porosity (n) of this peat is often as high as 80-97%, and the dry bulk density (rho(b)) as low as 0.05-0.25 g cm-3. It has recently been hypothesized that this is the result of a progressive occlusion of pores in the peat matrix by bubbles of gas (especially methane) which are generated in-situ by ongoing anaerobic respiration. To test this hypothesis, the change with time of hydraulic conductivity (K), volumetric water content (THETA), volumetric gas content (gamma), and gaseous methane concentration (M) were measured in three, repacked laboratory columns of catotelm peat through which de-aired, temperature equilibrated water flowed continuously under positive pressure. Two of the columns contained microbially active peat which was packed to average n and rho(b) values of 96.2% and 0.06 g cm-3, respectively. The third column was similarly packed (n = 95.5%, rho(b) = 0.07 g cm-3) and then sterilized using 5.5 Mrad Co-60 gamma radiation to render it microbially inactive. In the two unsterilized columns, K decreased on average from 7.0 x 10(-4) (+/- 6.1 x 10(-4)) cms-1  to 1.8 x 10(-5) (+/-1.7 x 10(-5)) cms-1; THETA decreased from 83.6% (+/- 3.6) to 64.6% (+/- 6.4); gamma increased from 12.5% (+/- 3.2) to 31.6% (+/- 6.4); and M increased from 3.9 (+/- 1.5)mu-mol ml-1 to 50.2 (+/- 14.9)mu-mol ml-1 during four separate measurement periods (two periods per column) which varied in length from 44 to 78 days. During a 41-day measurement period, K and THETA increased in the sterilized column to stable, relatively high values of 5.7 x 10(-3) cms-1 and 91.0%, respectively; gamma decreased to a stable low value of 4.5%; and only trace levels of M were detected. The changes and eventual stabilization of K, THETA and gamma in the sterilized column were due to the gradual removal by the flowing water of artifact carbon dioxide gas produced by the sterilization process. The lack of M and the low final gamma-value in the sterilized column indicate that no significant anaerobic respiration occurred during the measurement period. It was concluded that it is indeed possible for gas generated in situ by anaerobic respiration to cause a progressive and significant decrease in the K of moderately decomposed catotelm peat.

The main goal of our investigation was to deliver estimations of CH4 and N2O emission rates for this unique peatland type in Central Europe. CO2 and CH4 fluxes were also measured using a non-steady-state-flow-through manual chamber systems equipped with infrared gas analyzers and used to validate and adjust results obtained with the SIGMA system. The average methane fluxes for the 2009-2010 (excluding winter) period was 95.4 (+/- 32.4) mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) resulting in a cumulative CH4 emission of 23.4 (+/- 2.4) g CH4-C m(-2) A day growing season and 29.2 (+/- 3.2) g CH4-C m(-2) year(-1) for the whole of 2010. The average seasonal N2O fluxes were 13.6 (+/- 28.2) mu g N2O-N m(-2) d(-1). N2O fluxes were highly variable in time and sign (both uptake and emissions of N2O were observed during the accumulation periods). Maximum estimates of the annual emission rates of N2O were 0.004 g N2O-N m(-2) year(-1). Methane fluxes correlated significantly with the air and peat temperatures, but they were not dependent on water table depth. The N2O fluxes did not demonstrate a clear response to any environmental variables. Both CH4 and N2O emission rates were in the range of fluxes recorded in pristine peatlands in other climatic zones.

Drainage and irrigation activities intensified peat oxidation destruction, resulting in a more intense input of peat decomposition products (i.e., ammonium, nitrite and nitrate ions, as well as soluble organics). Surface and subsurface water draining the bog are favorable for the intense migration of iron and manganese ions in solution.

AB Laboratory columns (80 cm long, 10 cm diameter) of peat were constructed from samples collected from a subarctic fen, a temperate bog and a temperate swamp. Temperature and water table position were manipulated to establish their influence on emissions of CO2 and CH4 from the columns. A factorial design experiment revealed significant (P < 0.05) differences in emission of these gases related to peat type, temperature and water table position, as well as an interaction between temperature and water table. Emissions of CO2 and CH4 at 23-degrees-C were an average of 2.4 and 6.6 times larger, respectively, than those at 10-degrees-C. Compared to emissions when the columns were saturated, water table at a depth of 40 cm increased CO2 fluxes by an average of 4.3 times and decreased CH4 emissions by an average of 5.0 times. There were significant temporal variations in gas emissions during the 6-week experiment, presumably related to variations in microbial populations and substrate availability. Using columns with static water table depths of 0, 10, 20, 40 and 60 cm, CO2 emissions showed a positive, linear relation with depth, whereas CH4 emissions revealed a negative, logarithmic relation with depth. Lowering and then raising the water table from the peat surface to a depth of 50 cm revealed weak evidence of hysteresis in CO2 emissions between the falling and rising water table limbs. Hysteresis (falling > rising limb) was very pronounced for CH4 emissions, attributed to a release of CH4 stored in pore-water and a lag in the development of anaerobic conditions and methanogenesis on the rising limb. Decreases in atmospheric pressure were correlated with abnormally large emissions of CO2 and CH4 on the falling limb. Peat slurries incubated in flasks revealed few differences between the three peat types in the rates of CO2 production under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. There were, however, major differences between peat types in the rates of CH4 consumption under aerobic incubation conditions and CH4 production under anaerobic conditions (bog > fen > swamp), which explain the differences in response of the peat types in the column experiment.

AB We combined 13 months of daily isotope measurements in stream water with daily DOC and 15 min FDOM (fluorescent component of dissolved organic matter) data at three nested scales to identify how riparian peatlands generate runoff and influence DOC dynamics in streams. We investigated how runoff generation processes in a small, riparian peatland-dominated headwater catchment (0.65 km(2)) propagate to larger scales (3.2 km(2) and 31 km(2)) with decreasing percentage of riparian peatland coverage. Isotope damping was most pronounced in the 0.65 km(2) headwater catchment due to high water storage in the organic soils encouraging tracer mixing. At the largest scale, stream flow and water isotope dynamics showed a more flashy response. The isotopic difference between the sites was most pronounced in the summer months when stream water signatures were enriched. During the winter months, the inter site difference reduced. The isotopes also revealed evaporative fractionation in the peatland dominated catchment, in particular during summer low flows, which implied high hydrological connectivity in the form of constant seepage from the peatlands sustaining high baseflows at the headwater scale. This connectivity resulted in high DOC concentrations at the peatland site during baseflow (similar to 5 mg l(-1)). In contrast, at the larger scales, DOC was minimal during low flows (similar to 2 mgl(-1)) due to increased ground-water influence and the disconnection between DOC sources and the stream. High frequency data also revealed diel variability during low flows. Insights into event dynamics through the analysis of hysteresis loops showed slight dilution on the rising limb, the strong influence of dry antecedent conditions and a quick recovery between events at the riparian peatland site. Again, these dynamics are driven by the tight coupling and high connectivity of the landscape to the stream. At larger scales, the disconnection between the landscape units increases and the variable connectivity controls runoff generation and DOC dynamics. The results presented here suggest that the processes occurring in riparian peatlands in headwater catchments are less evident at larger scales which may have implications for the larger scale impact of peatland restoration projects.

AB We present here the phenomenon of gradual decay leading to plant mortality in vast stretches (measuring several square kilometres) of vibrant mangrove forests in the coastal wetlands of North and Middle Andaman. We interpret the phenomenon as an effect of static ground uplift following the 26 December 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake. The decimetre to metre scale uplift has cut-off tidal water flow into those parts of the wetlands that were elevated from intertidal to supratidal levels. The consequent thermal shock, desiccation and gradual depletion of soil salinity affected the plants in the elevated parts. However, desiccation due to lack of tidal-water inflow caused the plant mortality which took the proportions of an ecological disaster about three to four years after the earthquake. The voluminous forest debris produced by the withered plants is likely to be preserved in the coastal sedimentary sequences as peat beds and serve as palaeoseismic indicators.

AB Mire surface levels reflecting the water table depth are known to be an important vegetation gradient in boreal peatlands. We classified the vegetation by TWINSPAN, interpreted the vegetation gradients by ordination (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling) and analysed the peat thickness for the TWINSPAN communities and species (Indicator Species Analysis) from small-sized sample plots over extremely thin-peated to medium thick-peated, minerotrophic mire expanse vegetation from an aapa-mire complex Hirvisuo, Northern Ostrobothnia, Finland. The TWINSPAN communities and the ordination-result could be interpreted in relation to the mire surface levels and additionally in relation to the stability of the water regime on the basis of water level measurements made from the same habitat types in an earlier research. Peat thickness correlated with the stability of the water regime so that communities with an unstable water regime on sand were thin-peated (0-30 cm), while communities with a stable water regime were more thick-peated. We conclude here that the mire-ecological water-table gradient was dissected into two vegetation gradients in Hirvisuo: the gradient formed by mire surface levels reflecting the mean water table level and the stability of the water regime, which represents a gradient of local importance over boreal Fennoscandia. Peat procuding ability of the bottom layer in mires seems to be much dependent on it.

AB The abundance and shale-normalised fractionation patterns of rare earth elements (REEs) were studied in 121 streams of first and second order in an area where acid sulphate soils. developed on oxidised sulphide-bearing marine sediments. are abundant. During high-water flow events in autumn, on which this study focuses, the leaching of REEs from the acid sulphate soils is extensive, resulting in high total REE concentrations (up to > 1 mg/l) in streams draining such soils exclusively. In these streams, there is a general depletion of the heavy REEs explained by preferential scavenging of the latter by oxyhydroxides in the deepest soil-profile horizons. In streams draining areas of glacial till and peat, the REE concentrations are several orders of magnitude lower. In these streams, in contrast to the REE-enriched streams, there is a depletion of light REEs explained most likely by preferential complexation of the middle and heavy REEs by dissolved humic substances.

AB Understanding of the surface energy balance is important for predicting climate change effects on carbon cycling in peatlands. Modelling of surface energy fluxes is complicated in these environments because of microscale surface topography, non-vascular moss dynamics, and sparse overstory vegetation; thus traditional 'big leaf' approaches do not simulate peatland environments well. Here we adapted a three-source (leaf, hummock, hollow) energy balance model and applied it to energy flux and temperature data from the Mer Bleue bog peatland. Model results show that latent heat flux partitioning into components from the three sources was strongly tied to available energy, The model output suggests that the vascular plants contributed 60-80% of the latent beat flux, hummocks 10-30%, and hollows 10%. These component contributions to latent heat flux showed little variation throughout the study period. It appears that this behaviour resulted from offsetting controls imposed by the vascular plant physiology and moss and peat porosity and capillarity characteristics. Although there was no evidence of strong microadvection between the vascular shrubs and hummock and hollow microtopography, this study highlights the importance of moss in the overall peatland energy fluxes.

AB The Joux Valley (Swiss Jura Mountains) has a rather unusual history of human occupation, characterized by tardive but extensive settlement since the Late Middle Ages, followed by an intensive period of industrial development. To estimate the links between human activities and environmental consequences, sediment cores were retrieved in Lake Joux and submitted to a multiproxy analysis (high-resolution photographs, magnetic susceptibility, density, x-ray fluorescence, grain size, organic geochemistry, C-14, Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating). The diversity of anthropication phases, defined from historical data, is clearly recognized in the lake archive. The record suggests the region was mainly under climatic influence until the end of the 13th century. The growth of settlements in the valley and the associated massive deforestation is recorded by increasing terrestrial inputs, reflecting large-scale soil destabilization, which subsequently persists despite the transition from farming to industrial activities. Autochthonous contributions then dominate the record, both in response to climatic and anthropogenic influences. Construction works conducted at the outlet of the lake affected water flow, sedimentation and aquatic community (macrophytes, ostracods) dynamics. The substantial increase of anthropogenic heavy metals (Fe, Zn, Pb) recorded during the 20th century could reflect the development of the watch-making industry in the area, as well as the use of leaded gasoline. Historical information facilitated interpretation of the observed paleolimnological evolution in the context of varied coexisting human activities. This study highlights the importance of applying an integrated paleolimnological-historical approach in order to establish clear links between well-defined human activities and their subsequent environmental responses through time.

AB Northern peatlands constitute a significant source of atmospheric methane (CH4). However, management of undisturbed peatlands, as well as the restoration of disturbed peatlands, will alter the exchange of CH4 with the atmosphere. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to collate and analyze published studies to improve our understanding of the factors that control CH4 emissions and the impacts of management on the gas flux from northern (latitude 40 degrees to 70 degrees N) peatlands. The analysis includes a total of 87 studies reporting measurements of CH4 emissions taken at 186 sites covering different countries, peatland types, and management systems. Results show that CH4 emissions from natural northern peatlands are highly variable with a 95% CI of 7.6-15.7 g C m(-2) year(-1) for the mean and 3.3-6.3 g C m(-2) year(-1) for the median. The overall annual average (mean +/- SD) is 12 +/- 21 g C m(-2) year(-1) with the highest emissions from fen ecosystems. Methane emissions from natural peatlands are mainly controlled by water table (WT) depth, plant community composition, and soil pH. Although mean annual air temperature is not a good predictor of CH4 emissions by itself, the interaction between temperature, plant community cover, WT depth, and soil pH is important. According to short-term forecasts of climate change, these complex interactions will be the main determinant of CH4 emissions from northern peatlands. Drainage significantly (p < .05) reduces CH4 emissions to the atmosphere, on average by 84%. Restoration of drained peatlands by rewetting or vegetation/rewetting increases CH4 emissions on average by 46% compared to the original premanagement CH4 fluxes. However, to fully evaluate the net effect of management practice on the greenhouse gas balance from high latitude peatlands, both net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and carbon exports need to be considered.

AB The focus of this study is the relationship between water table depth (WTD) and water vapor [evapotranspiration (ET)] and carbon dioxide [CO2; net ecosystem exchange (NEE)] fluxes in a fen in western Canada. We analyzed hydrological and eddy covariance measurements from four snow-free periods (2003-2006) with contrasting meteorological conditions to establish the link between daily WTD and ET and gross ecosystem CO2 exchange (GEE) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco; NEE=R-eco-GEE), respectively: 2003 was warm and dry, 2004 was cool and wet, and 2005 and 2006 were both wet. In 2003, the water table (WT) was below the ground surface. In 2004, the WT rose above the ground surface, and in 2005 and 2006, the WT stayed well above the ground surface. There were no significant differences in total ET (similar to 316 mm period-1), but total NEE was significantly different (2003: 8 g C m-2 period-1; 2004: -139 g C m-2 period-1; 2005: -163 g C m-2 period-1; 2006: -195 g C m-2 period-1), mostly due to differences in total GEE (2003: 327 g C m-2 period-1; 2004: 513 g C m-2 period-1; 2005: 411 g C m-2 period-1; 2006: 556 g C m-2 period-1). Variation in ET is mostly explained by radiation (67%), and the contribution of WTD is only minor (33%). WTD controls the compensating contributions of different land surface components, resulting in similar total ET regardless of the hydrological conditions. WTD and temperature each contribute about half to the explained variation in GEE up to a threshold ponding depth, below which temperature alone is the key explanatory variable. WTD is only of minor importance for the variation in R-eco, which is mainly controlled by temperature. Our study implies that future peatland modeling efforts explicitly consider topographic and hydrogeological influences on WTD.

AB Water repellency alters soil hydrology after periods of wildfire, potentially modifying the ecosystem recovery to such disturbance. Despite this potential importance, the extent and severity of water repellency within burned peatlands and its importance in regulating peatland recovery to wildfire disturbance remains poorly understood. We characterised the water repellency of peat in a burned (one year post-fire) and unburned peatland in the Western Boreal Plain utilising the water drop penetration time and ethanol droplet molarity tests. Burned Sphagnum moss and feather moss sites had a more severe degree of water repellency than unburned sites, with differences being more pronounced between burned and unburned feather moss sites. Burned feather moss exhibited the most extreme water repellency, followed by unburned feather moss, and burned Sphagnum. The severity of water repellency varied with depth through the near surface of the moss/peat profile. This was most evident within the burned feathermoss where more extreme water repellency was observed at the near-surface compared to the surface, with the most extreme water repellency found at 1 and 5 cm depths. Unburned Sphagnum was completely hydrophilic at all depths. We suggest that the extreme water repellency in near-surface feather moss peat acts as a barrier that impedes the supply of water to the surface that replaces that lost via evaporation. This leads to drying of the near-surface vadose zone within feather moss areas and a concomitantly large decrease in peatland evaporation within feather moss dominated peatlands. This negative feedback mechanism likely enhances the resilience of such peatland to wildfire disturbance, maintaining a high water table position, thereby limiting peat decomposition. In comparison, such a feedback is not observed strongly within Sphagnum, leaving Sphagnum dominated peatlands potentially vulnerable to low water table positions post disturbance.

AB A process-based model (Forest-DNDC) was applied to describe the possible impacts of climate change on carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from a peat bog in European Russia. In the first step, Forest-DNDC was tested against CO2 fluxes measured by the eddy covariance method on an oligotrophic bog in a representative region of the southern taiga (56 degrees N33 degrees E). The results of model validations show that Forest-DNDC is capable of quantifying the CO2 fluxes from the bog ecosystem. In the second step, the validated model was used to estimate how the expected future changes of the air temperature and water table depth could affect the C dynamics in the bogs. It was shown that a decrease in the water table and an increase in temperature influence significantly the CO2 exchange between our bog ecosystem and the atmosphere. Under elevated temperature and deepened water table the bog ecosystems could become a significant source of atmospheric CO2.

AB Ecosystem respiration (ER) is an important but poorly understood part of the carbon (C) budget of peatlands and is controlled primarily by the thermal and hydrologic regimes. To establish the relative importance of these two controls for a large ombrotrophic bog near Ottawa, Canada, we analyzed ER from measurements of nighttime net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) determined by eddy covariance technique. Measurements were made from May to October over five years, 1998 to 2002. Ecosystem respiration ranged from less than 1 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in spring (May) and fall (late October) to 2-4 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) during mid-summer (July-August). As anticipated, there was a strong relationship between ER and peat temperatures (r(2) = 0.62). Q(10) between 5 degrees to 15 degrees C varied from 2.2 to 4.2 depending upon the choice of depth where temperature was measured and location within a hummock or hollow. There was only a weak relationship between ER and water-table depth (r(2) = 0.11). A laboratory incubation of peat cores at different moisture contents showed that CO2 production was reduced by drying in the surface samples, but there was little decrease in production due to drying from below a depth of 30 cm. We postulate that the weak correlation between ER and water table position in this peatland is primarily a function of the bog being relatively dry, with water table varying between 30 and 75 cm below the hummock tops. The dryness gives rise to a complex ER response to water table involving i) compensations between production of CO2 in the upper and lower peat profile as the water table falls and ii) the importance of autotrophic respiration, which is relatively independent of water-table position.

AB The protection of ecological functions of forested swamps and peatlands is the subject of legal and regulatory measures. In Quebec and elsewhere in Canada, wood harvesting is carried out on swamps and peatlands of merchantable forests. What is the impact of forestry practices on these wetlands hydrological functions such as sediment retention, groundwater recharge, flood reduction and low flow augmentation? The answer to this question is complex as the contribution of wetlands to these hydrological functions vary with each wetland type as underlined by the experts. With the aim of ascertaining the contribution of wetlands, and to infer the effects of forest management on forested swamps and peatlands, we carried out a literature review. The existing literature reviews only partially cover the subject or in the case of peatlands, they mainly consider drained sites. In this review, the links between the hydrologic functions and forest harvesting are treated by category of wetlands to take into account their anticipated specific contribution.

AB Understanding spatial variability of water table depth (WTD) in larger peatland area is crucial for peat conservation. This study investigated spatial patterns of WTDs in a peatland watershed of about 0.151 km(2), located in the Zoige basin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. Using conventional dipwells, we measured WTDs on 5/ 17/2017, 5/20/2017, 5/23/2017, 7/17/2017, and 9/18/2017 at 114, 103, 105, 77, and 81 locations, as well as peat depths (H) and elevations at 119 and 831 locations over the watershed, respectively. Then, we performed hotspot analysis and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) modeling, showing (1) highly localized spatial patterns of WTDs, H, and S (slope gradient, calculated from elevations), and (2) the area that had statistically significant local coefficients for H ranged between 51 and 57% of the total watershed area, while that for S was only < 11%. These complex spatial patterns of WTDs were further illustrated by our results of examining WTD changes in the lateral and longitudinal directions for two types of channels, deep gullies whose beds are deep and cut through the peat layer and shallow artificial ditches. The findings suggested that spatial and temporal changes of WTDs at the watershed scale may only be examined by collecting in situ samples, which may be achieved using an efficient sampling method provided in this study.

AB Three wetland sediment sections from two different locations (core CL-4 in the Chollipo area, and trenches HS and HY in the Pyeongtaek area) in west-central Korea yield crucial information on the timing and spatial pattern of century-scale climatic changes and subsequent surficial responses during the Holocene. In the Chollipo area, a lake environment developed from 7360 to 5000 calibrated years before present (cal. yr BP), the deposition of organic materials increased from 5000 to 2600 cal. yr BP, and peatland have formed since 2600 cal. yr BP. In the Pyeongtaek area, fluvial sediment was deposited prior to about 7000 cal. yr BP. From 7000 cal. yr BP onward, thick peat sequences started to develop. These two patterns of surficial responses to climate change through the Holocene are different from one another. While this might be due to the dissimilarity in geomorphic conditions, the approximate simultaneity of the environmental changes in the two areas shows that they both can be correlated with major climatic changes. Two such areas that have undergone major changes indicate that the hydrological factors including precipitation and strength of water flow were most responsible for the landscape and geomorphic evolution. The upward trend in relative sea level also played a primary role for environmental change in the coastal areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Researchers are developing techniques to mass produce Sphagnum fibers (SF) on a sustainable basis since this material has properties that could benefit the growing-media industry. The objective of this study was to incorporate SF into peat-based substrates to enhance the value of brown Sphagnum peat and/or replace perlite in blond peat mixes. Nine substrates were prepared by mixing brown Sphagnum peat (BrSP) or sieved brown Sphagnum peat (sBrSP) with 0, 15 and 30% of SF and substituting 0, 50 and 100% of the perlite in a 70% blond Sphagnum peat (BSP) and 30% perlite mix with SF. The growth of Pelargonium was unaffected by the addition of SF, with the exception of above-ground biomass which was 15% lower in the BrSP substrate containing 15% SF. In the case of Petunia, above-ground biomass increased with a 30% SF addition to sBrSP, and below-ground biomass increased with a 30% SF addition to BrSP and sBrSP. Adding SF to peat increased water retention and hydraulic conductivity, but either reduced or had no impact on air-filled porosity. Removing fine particles from BrSP and adding 30% SF provided promising results, although the effect varied with plant species. Moreover, it is clear that SF can be used as a substitute for perlite in BSP mixes.

AB In humid upland catchments wetlands are often a prominent feature in the vicinity of streams and have potential implications for runoff generation and nutrient export. Wetland surfaces are often characterized by distinct micro-topography (hollows and hummocks). The effects of such micro-topography on surface-subsurface exchange and runoff generation for a 10 by 20 m synthetic section of a riparian wetland were investigated in a virtual modeling experiment. A reference model with a planar surface was run for comparison. The geostatistically simulated structure of the micro-topography replicates the topography of a peat-forming riparian wetland in a small mountainous catchment in South-East Germany (Lehstenbach). Flow was modeled with the fully-integrated surface-subsurface code HydroGeoSphere. Simulation results showed that the specific structure of the wetland surface resulted in distinct shifts between surface and subsurface flow dominance. Surface depressions filled and started to drain via connected channel networks in a threshold controlled process, when groundwater levels intersected the land surface. These networks expanded and shrunk in a spill and fill mechanism when the shallow water table fluctuated around the mean surface elevation under variable rainfall inputs. The micro-topography efficiently buffered rainfall inputs and produced a hydrograph that was characterized by subsurface flow during most of the year and only temporarily shifted to surface flow dominance (>80% of total discharge) during intense rainstorms. In contrast the hydrograph in the planar reference model was much "flashier" and more controlled by surface runoff. A non-linear, hysteretic relationship between groundwater level and discharge observed at the study site was reproduced with the micro-topography model. Hysteresis was also observed in the relationship between surface water storage and discharge, but over a relatively narrow range of surface water storage values. Therefore it was concluded that surface water storage was a better predictor for the occurrence of surface runoff than groundwater levels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The bio-diversity (vegetation and fauna) of peatlands, like all wetland ecosystems, is very fragile as it requires specific wet conditions. Over the past 20 years, increasing efforts have been made to restore degraded wetlands, to re-create new wetlands where they were lost, and to sustainably manage for multiple benefits. However, actions to restore and preserve wetlands require an in-depth knowledge of the water cycle in the system. We used chemical and multi-isotopic approaches, combined with hydrological tools (measuring potentiometric levels and spring discharge), for tracing the water and dissolved-element fluxes in the Narces de la Sauvetat peatland (Central France) and for better understanding of water budget components involved in this ecosystem. This multi-pronged approach clearly demonstrated its effectiveness for improving our understanding of the hydrological functioning of this wetland ecosystem. The two main results are that: (1) The water volume flowing out of the peatland through the Fouragettes stream is often negligible; and (2) At least three strong groundwater fluxes with distinct chemical and isotopic signatures supply water to the peatland. This new understanding will help decision makers maintain the water balance of the peatland, which is essential for the preservation of this fragile ecosystem. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In hydrological terms, raised bogs are often approximated by simple models as in the acrotelm-catotelm concept. However, raised bogs are often characterized by a pronounced surface topography, causing large changes in connectivity of contributing areas on the bog. In this study, daily regression of measured discharges versus catchment areas is used to quantify the impact of surface topography on catchment connectivity within a raised bog. The resulting coefficient of determination shows the strength of the relationship between the discharge and catchment area over time under different hydrological conditions. Monitoring of discharge, water table, transmissivity, and basic weather data on a raised bog (1.9km(2)) in eastern central Estonia took place from May 2008 to June 2010. Contributing areas, calculated based on the outlet's discharge volume (V-Q) divided by the net precipitation volume ( VPnet), of the outlet containing the central pool-ridge system varied between 1x10(-3) and 0.7km(2), suggesting significant differences in connectivity between hydrological events. Correlation between discharge and theoretical catchment size was high (R-2>0.75) when the water table was close to the surface (less than 5cm below peat surface), and consequently, transmissivities were also high (up to 1,030m(2)d(-1)), which led to connectivity of local storage elements, such as pools and hollows. However, a water table below this threshold resulted in large parts of the catchment being disconnected. The importance of water table depths on catchment connectivity suggests the need to reconsider the hydrological concept of raised bogs; to incorporate these shallow flow components and better understand residence time and consequently transport of solutes, such as DOC, from patterned peatlands.

AB In the temperate climate of northeast Germany, a trade-off exists between water use in agricultural crop production and groundwater recharge which is important for urban water supply, irrigation, forestry and peat protection. The APSIM-Nwheat model was used to analyze the impact of climate change scenarios on deep drainage (DD), the water loss below the maximum root zone as the main source of groundwater recharge, and wheat production for two main soil types. A linear and a nonlinear climate scenario were used in this study: The linear scenario for 2001-2050 was based on a simple linearly modified historical climate record from 1951 to 2000. The nonlinear scenario used the same 1951-2000 historical climate record but combined it nonlinearly with a Global Circulation Model climate scenario for 2001-2050. Simulation results showed different distributions of deep drainage and grain yield with the linear and nonlinear scenarios, but no difference in the 50-year averages. Hence, a linear manipulation of climate records can be as effective for climate change impact studies on deep drainage and grain yield as nonlinearly manipulated climate data, if long-term average changes are of main interest. The simulation results indicated that a trade-off between deep drainage and grain yields can be potentially controlled through N management. However, such control mechanism was more effective under current climate conditions than under future climate and on a better water-holding silt soil compared to a poorer water-holding loamy sand. It is suggested that areas with poor water-holding soils should be managed extensively for groundwater recharge harvesting while better water-holding soils should be used for high input grain production.

AB Human alterations to hydrology have globally impacted wetland ecosystems. Preventing or reversing these impacts is a principal focus of restoration efforts. However, restoration effectiveness is often hampered by limited information on historical landscape properties and hydrologic regime. To help address this gap, we developed a novel statistical approach for inferring flows and inundation frequency (i.e., hydroperiod, HP) in wetlands where changes in spatial vegetation and geomorphic patterns have occurred due to hydrologic alteration. We developed an analytical expression for HP as a transformation of the landscape-scale stage-discharge relationship. We applied this model to the Everglades "ridge-slough'' (RS) landscape, a patterned, lotic peatland in southern Florida that has been drastically degraded by compartmentalization, drainage, and flow diversions. The new method reliably estimated flow and HP for a range of RS landscape patterns. Crucially, ridge-patch anisotropy and elevation above sloughs were strong drivers of flow-HP relationships. Increasing ridge heights markedly increased flow required to achieve sufficient HP to support peat accretion. Indeed, ridge heights inferred from historical accounts would require boundary flows 3-4 times greater than today, which agrees with restoration flow estimates from more complex, spatially distributed models. While observed loss of patch anisotropy allows HP targets to be met with lower flows, such landscapes likely fail to support other ecological functions. This work helps inform restoration flows required to restore stable ridge-slough patterning and positive peat accretion in this degraded ecosystem, and, more broadly, provides tools for exploring interactions between landscape and hydrology in lotic wetlands and floodplains.

Testate amoebae, plant macrofossils, pollen and microscopic charcoal were used to reconstruct environmental changes in Pomerania (northern Poland, Kaszuby Lakeland) from a 7-m thick peat archive of Stazki bog dated 5500 BC AD 1250. We obtained a record of proxies representing different spatial scales: regional vegetation changed simultaneously with local vegetation, and testate amoebae showed a pattern of change similar to that of pollen and plant macrofossils. On the basis of the combined proxies, we distinguished three hydroclimatic stages: moist conditions 5500-3450 BC, drier conditions with regionally increased fires up to 600 BC, and again moist conditions from 600 BC onward. During the drier interval, a first climatic shift to wetter conditions at 1700 BC is indicated by regional pollen as the replacement of Corylus by Carpinus, and locally by, e.g., the increase of Hyalosphenia elegans and mire plants such as Sphagnum sec. Cuspidata. Furthermore, we observed a correlation since 600 BC among the re-expansion of Carpinus (after a sudden decline ca. 950 BC), increased peat accumulation, increase of Hyalosphenia species, and fewer fires, suggesting lower evapotranspiration and a stable high water table in the bog. Fagus started to expand after AD 810 gradually replacing Carpinus, which was possibly due to a gradually more oceanic climate, though we cannot exclude human impact on the forests. Peat accumulation, determined by radiocarbon dating, varied with bog surface wetness. The hydroclimatic phases found in Stazki peatland are similar to moisture changes recorded in other sites from Poland and Europe. This is the first detailed record of hydroclimatic change during the Holocene in the southern Baltic region, so it forms a reference site for further studies on other southern Baltic bogs that are in progress.

AB Peatlands can play an important role in the hydrological dynamics of a watershed. However, interactions between groundwater and peat water remain poorly understood. Here, we present results of an exploratory study destined to test radon (Rn-222) as a potential tracer of groundwater inflows from fluvioglacial landform aquifers to slope peatlands in the Amos region of Quebec, Canada. Rn-222 occurs in groundwater but is expected to be absent from peat water because of its rapid degassing to the atmosphere. Any Rn-222 activity detected in peat water should therefore derive from groundwater inflow. Rn-222 activity was measured in groundwater from municipal, domestic wells and newly drilled and instrumented piezometers from the Saint-Mathieu-Berry and Barraute eskers (n = 9), from the Harricana Moraine (n = 4), and from the fractured bedrock (n = 3). Forty measurements of Rn-222 activity were made from piezometers installed in five slope peatlands, along six transects oriented perpendicular to the fluvioglacial deposits. The relationship between Rn-222 and total dissolved solids (TDS) measured in water from the mineral deposits underlying the peat layer suggests that Rn-222 is introduced by lateral inflow from eskers and moraine together with salinity. This input is then diluted by peat water, depleted in both TDS and Rn-222. The fact that a relationship between TDS and Rn-222 is visible calls for a continuous inflow of groundwater from lateral eskers/moraines, being Rn-222 rapidly removed from the system by radioactive decay. Although more research is required to improve the sampling and tracing techniques, this work shows the potential of Rn-222 tracer to identify groundwater inflow areas from granular aquifers found in eskers and moraines to slope peatlands.

AB Restoration and conservation of species-rich nature reserves requires inclusion of landscape-scale connections and transport processes such as hydrologic flows and species dispersal. These are important because they provide suitable habitat conditions and an adequate species pool. This study aimed at identifying the key hydrologic flows and plant dispersal processes affecting a landscape with species-rich fen reserves where restoration measures are carried out to set back succession. It also intended to use this information for delineating the area relevant for conservation planning on an Operational Landscape Unit map. The study was carried out for complexes of fen ponds in former turbaries in the Vechtplassen area, The Netherlands. A number of recent insights on plant dispersal were integrated with knowledge on hydrologic flows in the present approach. The results showed that groundwater discharge to ensure mesotrophic, base-rich conditions, should be enhanced by restoring the groundwater recharge areas NE of the reserves. A nearby lake with suitable water chemistry was also identified as a key source of surface water to feed the fens in dry periods. Water dispersal was identified as important within the fen reserves, whereas dispersal by daily migrating dabbling ducks, typically occurring over 2-3 km, was the most important route connecting the reserves with the surrounding landscape. The delineation of the Operational Landscape Unit for this region provides a basis for conservation and restoration that take fundamental landscape connections and transport processes into account. This unique approach simultaneously considers hydrological transport processes as well as species dispersal in the larger landscape beyond the reserves themselves and therefore leads to greater success of restoration and conservation.

AB Boreal peatlands contain approximately 500Pg carbon (C) in the soil, emit globally significant quantities of methane (CH4), and are highly sensitive to climate change. Warming associated with global climate change is likely to increase the rate of the temperature-sensitive processes that decompose stored organic carbon and release carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4. Variation in the temperature sensitivity of CO2 and CH4 production and increased peat aerobicity due to enhanced growing-season evapotranspiration may alter the nature of peatland trace gas emission. As CH4 is a powerful greenhouse gas with 34 times the warming potential of CO2, it is critical to understand how factors associated with global change will influence surface CO2 and CH4 fluxes. Here, we leverage the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) climate change manipulation experiment to understand the impact of a 0-9 degrees C gradient in deep belowground warming (Deep Peat Heat, DPH) on peat surface CO2 and CH4 fluxes. We find that DPH treatments increased both CO2 and CH4 emission. Methane production was more sensitive to warming than CO2 production, decreasing the C-CO2:C-CH4 of the respired carbon. Methane production is dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis but deep peat warming increased the C-13 of CH4 suggesting an increasing contribution of acetoclastic methanogenesis to total CH4 production with warming. Although the total quantity of C emitted from the SPRUCE Bog as CH4 is <2%, CH4 represents >50% of seasonal C emissions in the highest-warming treatments when adjusted for CO2 equivalents on a 100-year timescale. These results suggest that warming in boreal regions may increase CH4 emissions from peatlands and result in a positive feedback to ongoing warming.

AB Analyses of peat humification, testate amoebae, carbon and nitrogen content have been carried Out Oil a peat sequence from Altabergsmossen. At Gullbergbymossen testate amoebae and peat humification were analysed. Both bogs are located in eastern central Sweden. The longest sequence, Altabergsmossen, covers the last 150 yr and the data from Gullbergbymossen covers the last 60 yr, both with a time resolution of ca. 2-4 yr cm(-1). The different proxies were compared to each other and were also compared to instrumental meteorological data. Correlation between peat humification and C/N ratios is high whereas the correlation is low between these physical/chemical parameters and reconstructed water tables inferred from the testate amoebae assemblages. High peat humification values and C/N ratios greater than 50 indicate aerobic decay and are thought to reflect the thickness of the acrotelm. High humification values and low C/N ratios are recorded in peat deposited between 1965 and 1980, whereas the dry period starts in the early 1970s according to instrumental meteorological data and inferred water-table depth. The difference in the timing of the onset of a dry-shift between the physical/chennical proxies and meteorological data and testate amoebae derived water table changes is interpreted as renewed decay of already deposited peat. The term secondary decomposition is used for this process. The secondary decomposition process has implications for interpreting physical/chemical and biological parameters in peat as they may be Out of phase during the beginning of a dry-shift.

AB This paper presents a Holocene pollen record from an ombrotrophic bog in Southland, New Zealand, together with multiproxy data (testate amoebae, peat humification and plant macrofossils) from the same core to establish an independent semiquantitative record of peatland surface moisture. Linkages between reconstructed peatland surface moisture and regional forest composition are investigated using redundancy analysis of the forest pollen data constrained with predicted bog water-table depths. Over 32% of the pollen data variance can be explained by surface moisture changes in the bog, suggesting a common cause of water-table and regional vegetation change. Water tables were higher during the early to mid-Holocene when the forest was dominated by podocarp taxa. Water tables lowered after about 3300 cal. yr BP coevally with the expansion of Nothofagus species, culminating with the dominance of Nothofagus subgenus Fuscospora in the past 1200 cal. yr BP. This is in apparent opposition to the warm/dry to cool/wet trend suggested by subjective interpretation of pollen data alone, from this and other studies. We suggest that during the late Holocene, drier summers associated with shifts in solar insolation caused reduced surface wetness and summer humidity, which together with a trend to cooler winters, apparently favoured the regeneration of Nothofagus species.

AB The aim of this study was to build regression models between mean water table depth (WTD, cm) and net soil CO2 emissions (g m(-2) year(-1)) using data from boreal peatlands drained for forestry. We found that net soil CO2 emissions increased linearly with increasing WTD to depths of approximately 60 cm. The regression equations differed between nutrient rich (n = 33) and nutrient poor (n = 39) study sites: net soil CO2 emissions = -115 + 12 x WTD (nutrient rich); net soil CO2 emissions = -259 + 6 x WTD (nutrient poor). These regressions can be used to estimate changes in CO2 emissions associated with changes in forest management practices.

AB This study uses an integrated modeling framework that couples the dynamics of hydrology, soil thermal regime, and ecosystem carbon and nitrogen to quantify the long-term peat carbon accumulation in Alaska during the Holocene. Modeled hydrology, soil thermal regime, carbon pools and fluxes, and methane emissions are evaluated using observation data at several peatland sites in Minnesota, Alaska, and Canada. The model is then applied for a 10,000 year (15 ka to 5 ka; 1 ka = 1000 cal years before present) simulation at four peatland sites. We find that model simulations match the observed carbon accumulation rates at fen sites during the Holocene (R-2 = 0.88, 0.87, 0.38, and -0.05 using comparisons in 500 year bins). The simulated (2.04 m) and observed peat depths (on average 1.98 m) were also compared well (R-2 = 0.91). The early Holocene carbon accumulation rates, especially during the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) (35.9 g Cm-2 yr(-1)), are estimated up to 6 times higher than the rest of the Holocene (6.5 g Cm-2 yr(-1)). Our analysis suggests that high summer temperature and the lengthened growing season resulted from the elevated insolation seasonality, along with wetter-than-before conditions might be major factors causing the rapid carbon accumulation in Alaska during the HTM. Our sensitivity tests indicate that, apart from climate, initial water table depth and vegetation canopy are major drivers to the estimated peat carbon accumulation. When the modeling framework is evaluated for various peatland types in the Arctic, it can quantify peatland carbon accumulation at regional scales.

AB Understanding the processes controlling peatland carbon (C) sequestration is critical to anticipate potential changes in the global C cycle in response to climate change. Although identification of these factors may be relatively straightforward on seasonal timescales, at centennial to millennial timescales complexities arise because of interactions between climate, vegetation, hydrology and long-term ecological processes. To better understand the factors controlling long-term C accumulation, Holocene rates of C sequestration were quantified from three pristine ombrotrophic peatlands in boreal Quebec, northeastern Canada (52 degrees N, 75-76 degrees W). Bulk density and loss-on-ignition analyses, combined with radiocarbon dating and age-depth modelling, were used to estimate long-term apparent rates of carbon accumulation. Past changes in vegetation and water-table depth were obtained from plant macrofossil and testate amoeba analysis. Earliest regional peat accumulation started similar to 7520 cal. BP, with long-term rates of C sequestration varying between 14.9 and 22.6 g/m(2) per yr. High C sequestration rates occurred during the mid Holocene when relatively stable Sphagnum section Acutifolia communities were present, while low rates were found during the cooler late Holocene when Cyperaceae and ligneous vegetation were more dominant. However, C sequestration was highly variable among cores, implying that local topography, geomorphology and hydrology, or disturbance factors such as fire, mediate the influence of climate on C accumulation. Reconstructed water-table depths reveal several dry shifts since 3000 cal. BP, suggesting that episodic cold and dry conditions during the late Holocene may have contributed to lower C sequestration rates. Given the intensity of the water-table shifts at these times, we hypothesize that recurrent episodes of frozen subsurface peat might have intensified surface drying. As projected by climate scenarios, anticipated warmer and wetter conditions may lead to greater stability of hummock Sphagna cover and increased C sequestration potential in boreal peatlands.

AB Wetlands play an important role in preventing extreme low flows in rivers and groundwater level drawdowns during drought periods. This hydrological function could become increasingly important under a warmer climate. Links between peatlands, aquifers, and rivers remain inadequately understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the hydrologic functions of the Lanoraie peatland complex in southern Quebec, Canada, under different climate conditions. This peatland complex has developed in the beds of former fluvial channels during the final stages of the last deglaciation. The peatland covers a surface area of similar to 76 km(2) and feeds five rivers. Numerical simulations were performed using a steady-state groundwater flow model. Results show that the peatland contributes on average to 77% of the mean annual river base flow. The peatland receives 52% of its water from the aquifer. Reduced recharge scenarios (-20 and -50% of current conditions) were used as a surrogate of climate change. With these scenarios, the simulated mean head decreases by 0.6 and 1.6 m in the sand. The mean river base flow decreases by 16 and 41% with the two scenarios. These results strongly underline the importance of aquifer-peatland-river interactions at the regional scale. They also point to the necessity of considering the entire hydrosystem in conservation initiatives.

AB This study of an abandoned cutover bog aims to understand the processes controlling moisture conditions that have led to distinct spatial patterns of Sphagnum recolonization, and also how substrate conditions may have changed since abandonment and the implications for plant establishment. Two (unreplicated) symmetrical 12 x 3.5 m(2) quadrats either side of the centre-line of a block-cut trench were treated by removing all recolonized vegetation, including Sphagnum, from one quadrat (REMOV), examining Sphagnum-covered (SPHAG) peat in the other, and bare peat (BARE) in both. Average volumetric soil moisture contents 0 in the peat (2 cm below the surface) of the SPHAG and REMOV substrates were similar (similar to86%), but greater than in BARE peat (similar to78%). In a location not manipulated for this experiment, where Sphagnum cushions have re-established on bare cutover peat, theta beneath the cushions was 5-14% greater than in bare cutover peat directly adjacent to it, indicating that cushions can regulate local substrate water storage, and benefit from it during periods of increased water demand. This may have assisted in the lateral expansion of sphagnum. A loosely structured 0.5 to 1.0 cm thick organic litter layer (chiefly Ericaceae) overlying the BARE peat substrate slowed the rate of drying of bare peat in a laboratory sample. The laboratory tests found the capillary fringe to be up to 26 cm above the water table. The dry conditions and the larger pore structure of this litter layer hindered upward capillary flow and, therefore, plant water availability. In (occluded) ditches and low areas, the capillary fringe remained within 5 cm of the surface, and these locations supported the most complete Sphagnum cover. In slightly higher areas, where the capillary fringe was about 20 cm below the surface, and because of the leaf litter, capillary water supply to the surface is sufficiently restricted to limit Sphagnum recolonization. These locations may have to await lateral expansion of Sphagnum cushions to achieve a full cover. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Net CO, exchange measured under well-mixed atmospheric conditions in four different mires in Sweden and Finland were used to analyse which factors were controlling photosynthesis and respiration. The parameters of a light response function showed strong seasonal variations with similar behaviour for all mires. The half-monthly nighttime respiration rates in the central part of the growing season were about two times higher in the southernmost, warmest site. Faje. as compared to the northernmost, coldest site, Kaamanen. However. Kaamanen had high photosynthesis rates, and this in combination with the long daylight periods in the middle of the summer caused Kaamanen to have the largest net ecosystem exchange (NEE) during the summer period. Faje that showed the highest productivity had also the highest respiration and therefore. the lowest NEE during summer. Correlation between half-monthly components and different environmental variables showed the highest correlation between the components themselves. Thereafter came temperature except for Faje where water table depth (WTD) explained most of the variance both for detrended and temperature-normalized components. All sites showed dependencies between WTD and the respective components during drying up periods. Temperature sensitivity was higher for productivity than for respiration indicating that CO uptake would increase during global warming.

AB A 2700-year-old peat core from the southern West Siberian Lowlands was used to reconstruct past water-table depth using testate amoeba analysis and to compare hydrological changes with temperature variations associated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly, Little Ice Age', and 20th-century warming. The robustness of water-table results was assessed using comparisons of four separate transfer functions, a testate amoeba reconstruction from an additional site in southern West Siberia, and an independent hydrological proxy of the C-13 values of Sphagnum remains from the same core. The paleohydrology results were robust in that (1) all four transfer functions returned similar results, (2) both peatland sites displayed very similar water-table fluctuations despite their distance from each other, and (3) Sphagnum C-13 values showed similar overall changes as the testate amoeba-inferred hydrology, but at a coarser temporal resolution. When comparing reconstructed hydrology in southern West Siberia to Northern Hemisphere temperatures, we found that during most of the record warmer time intervals tended to be wet locally and cooler time intervals tended to be dry including during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (similar to 1150-650cal. BP). This pairing continued until the Little Ice Age' (similar to 650-100cal. BP) when conditions became cool and wet, and recently, conditions have become warm again, but unlike the earlier wet interval, the peatlands have dried. Drier conditions shown by the water-table depth reconstruction suggest that future warming may continue the drying of southern peatland surfaces in the West Siberian Lowlands and may promote peat carbon respiration.

AB Flowing water can disperse a high number of seeds and vegetative propagules over long distances and is therefore a very important dispersal vector in wetland habitats. Although the dispersal of seeds is relatively well studied, the dispersal of vegetative propagules has received less attention. However, in riparian and aquatic systems where many species have clonal growth forms, it can be very important. The relative importance of vegetative propagules in the dispersal of fen species was assessed first by determining their relative abundance in the field and second, by determining the buoyancy of plant fragments of ten fen species experimentally. On average, vegetative propagules made up 3.2-58.9% of the total propagule number (mainly Elodea nutallii). Buoyancy of the tested species ranged from 25 days to over 6 months. Surprisingly, the propagules of Stratiotes aloides and Hydrocharis morsus-ranae increased buoyancy when spring started (after ca. 100 days). The results demonstrate that vegetative propagules of riparian and aquatic fen species have a high capacity to disperse over long distances via water and are therefore likely to play an important role in the colonisation of new habitats. Especially because in nine out of the ten species tested, over 50% of the propagules were still viable after 6 months of floating.

AB Sorption and leaching of the organophosphate (OP) pesticides chlorpyrifos, profenofos, methyl parathion and malathion were investigated with four different types of biomass: coconut husk, rice husk, peat moss and peanut shell. Organic carbon contents of the biomass were in the range of 35.4-45.4%. Sorption studies were carried out by the batch (equilibrium) method at 4 different OP spike concentrations and at pH 3-7. Sorption isotherms conformed to a linear Freundlich equation and the Freundlich constant or sorption coefficient (K-D) confirmed that biomass organic carbon content was the principal sorbent factor affecting OP sorption. For a given sorbent, correlation of the extent of sorption with sorbate chemical properties was examined. Column leaching experiments involving different masses of coconut husk and peanut shell pre-spiked with OPs at the level equivalent to actual spraying concentrations in some Thai tangerine orchards were conducted. These experiments included repeated spikings and leaching. A water flow rate of 20 mL min(-1) was employed corresponding to the current average watering regime. Retardation and biodegradation with these sorbents were also examined.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the influence of land cover changes on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) in the Daqing Prefecture of China, where heavy industrialisation in the form of dense oil wells has impacted the environment. Time-series presentations for the period 1978 to 2008 of remotely sensed data and soil survey data were used to assess the extent of the changes. The study revealed soil degradation under all land cover types and in all soil types, grassland retreat (-15 per cent), swampland retreat (-45 per cent) and increases in the area of farmland (+19 per cent), sand land (+1450 per cent) and alkaline land (+52 per cent). Depletion of the SOC pool occurred in swampland (-64 per cent) both because of the decrease in the area of swampland and because of a decrease in SOC density (-34 per cent). An increase in the SOC pool occurred in alkaline land because of the increase in the area and also because of an increase in SOC density (+297 per cent), but there was little change in the SOC pool in farmland because the increase in area was largely offset by a decrease in SOC density (-14 per cent). The decrease in the STN pool was substantial (-44 per cent), with the largest contributor being the decrease in swamplands (-74 per cent), partly because of the decrease in the area of swampland and partly because of a decrease in STN density (-52 per cent). Large decreases in the STN pool also occurred in farmland (-22 per cent) and grassland (-41 per cent). The direct impacts of construction associated with the expansion of the oil industry were overshadowed by indirect impacts such as interference with water flows and water levels resulting in salinisation of soil. The study also revealed that land cover changes are much more dynamic than a simple analysis would reveal, and because of lag times in the loss of SOC, soil degradation will continue even if land cover changes cease.

AB A peat core from an ombrotrophic mire in central Sweden was analysed for multi-proxy indicators (plant macrofossils, pollen/non-pollen microfossils, restate amoebae, colorimetric humification, carbon/nitrogen ratios, bulk densities, loss on ignition), to evaluate the relative contributions of climate change and human impact on vegetation and peat accumulation during the last c. 350 years. C-14 wiggle-match daring was applied for high precision dating. Testate amoebae assemblages were used to reconstruct past water table depths and compared with other proxies and instrumental climate data from the mid-18th century onwards, Changes in mire surface wetness were mainly caused by climate change (precipitation and evaporation), but the internal dynamics of the local bog vegetation may also have played a role in the recorded water table changes. The human impact signal in the pollen data was compared with Swedish population and land-use data. A link between climate change, human impact (openness of the vegetation) and demographic change was found. Cold and wet periods show a decrease in human impact and open land indicators in the pollen data, followed by an increase in death rate and/or an increase in emigration. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

SO GEOGRAPHIE PHYSIQUE ET QUATERNAIRE

DT Article
AB Pollen and plant macrofossil sequence of a core at the margin of the Farnham bog provide a local developmental record that can be subdivided into five main stages for this part of the peatland. Organic sedimentation began around 8500 year BP in a shallow pound at the centre of the depression following the retreat of the Champlain Sea. Subsequent centrifugal paludification caused the onset of peat accumulation at the sampling point about 8100 year BP. An initial forested fen dominated by larch (1) has been rapidly followed by a treed fen (2) until 6900 year BP. This stage was succeeded by a fen characterized by sparse trees and the development of open-water pools (3) until 5800 year BP. At that time, the vegetation changed to oligotrophic bog (4) until the present. Recently, the influence of external factors such as fire and anthropogenic activity resulted (5) in the establishment of tree species typical of disturbed environments. Paludification and local developmental trends are closely controlled primarily by continuous peat accumulation, local hydrology, climate and fire. The formation of pools around 6900 year BP and the synchronous spread of Tsuga canadensis populations in the surrounding forests suggest an increasing trend towards moister conditions with higher precipitation and/or reduced summer evapotranspiration.

AB Predictive understanding of northern peatland hydrology is a necessary precursor to understanding the fate of massive carbon stores in these systems under the influence of present and future climate change. Current models have begun to address microtopographic controls on peatland hydrology, but none have included a prognostic calculation of peatland water table depth for a vegetated wetland, independent of prescribed regional water tables. We introduce here a new configuration of the Community Land Model (CLM) which includes a fully prognostic water table calculation for a vegetated peatland. Our structural and process changes to CLM focus on modifications needed to represent the hydrologic cycle of bogs environment with perched water tables, as well as distinct hydrologic dynamics and vegetation communities of the raised hummock and sunken hollow microtopography characteristic of peatland bogs. The modified model was parameterized and independently evaluated against observations from an ombrotrophic raised-dome bog in northern Minnesota (S1-Bog), the site for the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climatic and Environmental Change experiment (SPRUCE). Simulated water table levels compared well with site-level observations. The new model predicts hydrologic changes in response to planned warming at the SPRUCE site. At present, standing water is commonly observed in bog hollows after large rainfall events during the growing season, but simulations suggest a sharp decrease in water table levels due to increased evapotranspiration under the most extreme warming level, nearly eliminating the occurrence of standing water in the growing season. Simulated soil energy balance was strongly influenced by reduced winter snowpack under warming simulations, with the warming influence on soil temperature partly offset by the loss of insulating snowpack in early and late winter. The new model provides improved predictive capacity for seasonal hydrological dynamics in northern peatlands, and provides a useful foundation for investigation of northern peatland carbon exchange.

AB Peatlands are recognized as important carbon stores; despite this, many have been drained for agricultural improvement. Drainage has been shown to lower water tables and alter vegetation composition, modifying primary productivity and decomposition, potentially initiating peat loss. To quantify CO2 fluxes across whole landscapes, it is vital to understand how vegetation composition and CO2 fluxes vary spatially in response to the pattern of drainage features. However, Molinia caerulea-dominated peatlands are poorly understood despite their widespread extent.
   Photosynthesis (P-G600) and ecosystem respiration (R-Eco) were modelled (12 degrees C, 600 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), greenness excess index of 60) using empirically derived parameters based on closed-chamber measurements collected over a growing season. Partitioned below-ground fluxes were also collected. Plots were arranged 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 the distance between adjacent ditches in two catchments located in Exmoor National Park, southwest England.
   Water table depths were deepest closest to the ditch and non-significantly (p = 0.197) shallower further away. Non-Molinia species coverage and the Simpson diversity index significantly decreased with water table depth (p < 0.024) and increased non-significantly (p < 0.083) away from the ditch. No CO2 fluxes showed significant spatial distribution in response to drainage ditches, arguably due to insignificant spatial distribution of water tables and vegetation composition. Whilst R-Eco showed no significant spatial variation, P-G600 varied significantly between sites (p = 0.012), thereby controlling the spatial distribution of net ecosystem exchange between sites. As P-G600 significantly co-varied with water table depths (p = 0.034), determining the spatial distribution of water table depths may enable CO2 fluxes to be estimated across M. caerulea-dominated landscapes.

AB Drainage and cultivation of peat soils almost always result in rapid soil degradation and a loss of soil organic matter (SOM). Winter cover crop cultivation and subsequent incorporation and watertable elevation have been considered as potential strategies to improve soil quality and decrease nutrient loss in drained and cultivated peatlands. However, the combined effect of residue incorporation and watertable management on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in these highly productive fen peat soils remains unknown. In the present study, two winter cover crops with contrasting carbon/nitrogen ratios (vetch [Vicia sativa], 45-60; rye [Secale cereale], 13-14) were incorporated into peat soils as green manure (without extra synthetic/organic N addition) at two watertable depths (-50 and -30 cm). Our results showed that fast mineralization of incorporated residues can cause a large pulse of GHG release under favourable environmental conditions. Both vetch and rye incorporation increased CO2 emissions compared with the bare soil treatments due to labile C addition and removal of N constraints. However, the two cover crops had strongly contrasting effects on N2O emissions. Incorporation of low C/N ratio vetch stimulated N2O emissions (average 21.8 +/- 7.3 mg N m(-2) hr(-1)) compared with the bare soil treatments, whereas high C/N ratio rye decreased N2O emissions (average 0.09 +/- 0.03 mg N m(-2) hr(-1)). Raising the watertable slightly reduced CO2 emissions from an average of 1.3 +/- 0.4 (the bare soils) to 0.9 +/- 0.3 g C m(-2) hr(-1) by inhibiting SOM mineralization but significantly increased N2O emissions in the vetch treatments by stimulating denitrification. CH4 fluxes were not affected by watertable depth, and their contribution to total global warming potential was negligible. Therefore, we conclude that high C/N ratio cover crops (e.g., rye) in combination with a raised watertable may represent a viable management option to mitigate GHG fluxes in fen peat soils.

AB As compared with mineral soils, there are few in situ measurements of the unsaturated hydraulic properties of peat soils available. We used parameter estimation (inverse) methods to estimate the water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions of drained peat soils from both laboratory and field data. The laboratory data were obtained on small cores using the traditional evaporation method, while the field data were obtained by means of evaporation experiments using groundwater lysimeters with and without vegetation. The field experiments without vegetation produced highly uncertain parameters and were limited to a relatively small pressure head range. Better results were obtained for the lysimeter with a grass cover that caused the peat soil to dry out more. However, a physically realistic minimum in the objective function for the plant-covered lysimeter could be found only when prior information about several parameters was included in the optimization. Good agreement was obtained between the laboratory and field measurements. The hydraulic functions were subsequently tested by comparing forward simulations with independently measured pressure heads and water contents of an additional lysimeter experiment under grass. The dynamics of the drying process was described well using the optimized soil hydraulic properties.

AB Peatland vegetation is controlled primarily by the depth of the water table, making peat paleovegetation a useful climate archive. We applied a biochemical approach to quantitatively estimate the plant sources of peat carbon based on (1) neutral sugar compositions of Sphagnum, vascular plants, and lichens and (2) lignin phenol compositions of vascular plants. We used these biochemical indices to characterize vegetation change over the last 2000years in four peat cores from the West Siberian Lowland (Russia) to investigate climate change during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and Little Ice Age. The vegetation was dominated by Sphagnum in all four cores, but was punctuated by several rapid but transient transitions to vascular plant dominance in the two cores from the southern West Siberian Lowland (<60 degrees N latitude). Lichen contributions were evident at the end of the Medieval Climate Anomaly and during the Little Ice Age in the two cores from northern West Siberian Lowland (>60 degrees N), possibly indicating permafrost development. However, there was no evidence for sustained vegetation change in response to either climatic event in cores from southern West Siberian Lowland. This suggests that these climatic events were relatively mild in the southern West Siberian Lowland, although the sensitivity of bog plant communities to climate change remains poorly understood.

AB Peatlands in continuous permafrost regions represent a globally-important store of organic carbon, the stability of which is thought to be at risk under future climatic warming. To better understand how these ecosystems may change in a warmer future, we use a palaeoenvironmental approach to reconstruct changes in two peatlands near Toolik Lake on Alaska's North Slope (TFS1 and TFS2). We present the first testate amoeba-based reconstructions from peatlands in continuous permafrost, which we use to infer changes in water-table depth and porewater electrical conductivity during the past two millennia. TFS1 likely initiated during a warm period between 0 and 300 CE. Throughout the late-Holocene, both peatlands were minerotrophic fens with low carbon accumulation rates (means of 18.4 and 14.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for cores TFS1 and TFS2 respectively). However, since the end of the Little Ice Age, both fens have undergone a rapid transition towards oligotrophic peatlands, with deeper water tables and increased carbon accumulation rates (means of 59.5 and 48.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for TFS1 and TFS2 respectively). We identify that recent warming has led to these two Alaskan rich fens to transition into poor fens, with greatly enhanced carbon accumulation rates. Our work demonstrates that some Arctic peatlands may become more productive with future regional warming, subsequently increasing their ability to sequester carbon. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Testate amoebae (Protozoa) were studied in spring, summer, and fall from the same microhabitats in a small Sphagnum-dominated peatland in southern Ontario, Canada. A total of 32 sampling stations were established in two wetland plant communities, 19 in an open Ericaceae low-shrub community and 13 in a closed Picea mariana and Larix laricina swamp community. Sphagnum was collected in each station for analysis of testate amoebae and measurement of soil water content parameters and water table depth in May, August, and October 2001. pH and dissolved oxygen of the groundwater under the Sphagnum were measured also. A total of 52 taxa including the rotifer, Habrotrocha angusticollis, were identified. Soil water content and water table variables emerged as the primary factors separating testate amoebae between the open bog/fen community and swamp community. Testate amoebae in the open bog/fen community showed a clear separation between the May sampling period and the August and October sampling periods. Sampling stations in May had much higher water table and were wetter than those in August and October. Conversely, testate amoebae in the swamp community did not show a clear difference between sampling periods. Soil moisture and water tables appear to be more constant in the swamp communities. Biological factors or other microscale environmental factors may need to be considered to explain seasonal changes in testate amoebae. A greater understanding of relationships between testate amoebae and microenvironmental factors is necessary to track seasonality in testate amoebae distributions.

AB Eutrophication is a major threat for several species-rich habitat types e.g. fens and meadows in riparian discharge areas throughout Europe, but few data are available to support the supposition that nutrient-contaminated groundwater from agricultural land is the direct cause for the continued decline of these formerly widespread habitat types. In the present study we investigated the role of nitrogen for the distribution of groundwater-dependent vegetation types in discharge areas in Denmark. Specifically we hypothesised (1) that the nitrogen availability in riparian discharge areas is linked to agricultural intensity in the topographic catchment and (2) that the spatial distribution of vegetation in riparian areas is influenced by nitrogen in the groundwater e.g. high productive reed beds dominate in areas with high levels of groundwater nitrogen, whereas species rich fens occur in areas with lower levels of groundwater nitrogen reflecting that incoming nutrients influence the productivity within the areas. We find evidence that the percentage of agriculture in the topographic catchment directly influenced the amount of nitrate in the discharging groundwater in the study areas and that groundwater nitrogen is closely coupled to the distribution of groundwater-dependent vegetation. Meadow and reed bed vegetation being highly productive were associated with higher levels of nitrate in the groundwater compared to low productive rich fen vegetation. From these findings we recommend that protected groundwater-dependent vegetation is mapped in groundwater discharge areas and that only those without presence of protected habitats are considered in rewetting plans to mitigate nutrient loss from agricultural production.

TI A first estimate of ground water ages for the deep aquifer of the

SO GROUND WATER
LA English
DT Article
ID AUSTRALIA; CL-36
AB The Kathmandu Basin in Nepal contains up to 550 m of Pliocene-Quaternary fluvio-lacustrine sediments which have formed a dual aquifer system. The unconfined sand and gravel aquifer is separated by a clay aquitard, up to 200 m thick, from the deeper, confined aquifer, comprised of Pliocene sand and gravel beds, intercalated with clay, peat, and lignite. The confined aquifer currently provides an important water supply to the central urban area but there are increasing concerns about its sustainability due to overexploitation.
   A limited number of determinations of the radioisotope Cl-36 have been made on bore waters in the basin, allowing us to postulate on the age of ground water in the deeper, confined aquifer. Ground water evolution scenarios based on radioisotope decay, gradual dissolution of formational salts as the ground waters move downgradient, and flow velocity estimations produce comparable ground water ages for the deep waters, ranging from 200,000 to 400,000 years. From these ages, we deduce a mean ground water flow velocity of only 45 mm/year from recharge in the northeast to the main extraction region 15 km to the southwest. We thus estimate current recharge at about 5 to 15 mm/year, contributing 40,000 to 1.2 million m(3)/year to the ground water system. Current ground water extraction is estimated to be 20 times this amount. The low specific discharge confirms that the resource is being mined, and, based on current projections, reserves will be used up within 100 years.

AB To assess the effect of the invasion of vascular plants on the heat and water balance in a Sphagnum bog, evapotranspiration was compared throughout a growing season in the Sphagnum bog and in the adjoining transition peatland where vascular plants completely cover the ground surface in the Sarobetsu mire, northern Japan. Cumulative evapotranspiration over 152 days was 372 mm in the transition peatland and 285 mm in the bog, with the differences between the sites becoming clear from mid-August. Therefore, we consider the invasion of the vascular plants into the Sphagnum bog to accelerate water consumption. However, levels of evapotranspiration in mid-summer did not differ greatly between the sites. In mid-summer, the ratio of latent heat flux to net radiation decreased in the transition peatland on days when humidity deficit was large, although, in the bog, the ratio showed a large value in those days. We attribute the decrease in the ratio to stomatal closure with the increase in humidity deficit. We also conclude that the invading vascular plants developed a negative feedback mechanism of stomatal response to the humidity deficit of the ambient air in mid-summer.

AB To explore the use of testate amoeba for investigating the impacts of climate change on permafrost peatland hydrology, we established a new modern training set from Arctic permafrost peatlands in north-east European Russia and Finnish Lapland. Ordination analyses showed that water-table depth (WTD) was the most important control on testate amoeba distribution. We developed a new testate amoeba-based WTD transfer function and thoroughly tested it. We found that our transfer function had strong predictive power. The best-performing model was based on tolerance-downweighted weighted averaging with inverse deshrinking (R-2 = 0.77, RMSEP = 5.62 cm with leave-one-out cross validation). The new transfer function was applied to a short peat core from Arctic Russia and revealed two major hydrological shifts, which could be validated against plant macrofossil data. We also compared our model to another two models from more temperate peatlands. Comparison of the different testate amoeba datasets suggests that testate amoeba ecohydrological relationships are similar for permafrost peatlands to those in more temperate regions, but there are some differences that suggest a need for training datasets that are fully representative of permafrost peatlands.

AB Permafrost strongly controls hydrological processes in cold regions. Our understanding of how changes in seasonal and perennial frozen ground disposition and linked storage dynamics affect runoff generation processes remains limited. Storage dynamics and water redistribution are influenced by the seasonal variability and spatial heterogeneity of frozen ground, snow accumulation and melt. Stable isotopes are potentially useful for quantifying the dynamics of water sources, flow paths and ages, yet few studies have employed isotope data in permafrost-influenced catchments. Here, we applied the conceptual model STARR (the Spatially distributed Tracer-Aided Rainfall-Runoff model), which facilitates fully distributed simulations of hydrological storage dynamics and runoff processes, isotopic composition and water ages. We adapted this model for a subarctic catchment in Yukon Territory, Canada, with a time-variable implementation of field capacity to include the influence of thaw dynamics A multi-criteria calibration based on stream flow, snow water equivalent and isotopes was applied to 3 years of data. The integration of isotope data in the spatially distributed model provided the basis for quantifying spatio-temporal dynamics of water storage and ages, emphasizing the importance of thaw layer dynamics in mixing and damping the melt signal. By using the model conceptualization of spatially and temporally variable storage, this study demonstrates the ability of tracer-aided modelling to capture thaw layer dynamics that cause mixing and damping of the isotopic melt signal.

AB Cedar Bog Nature Preserve, located near Urbana, OH, encompasses several wetland types including an alkaline fen. in this fen, groundwater emerges in quicksand-like discharge zones consisting of porous Ca/Mg carbonates mixed with organic detritus. This study evaluates seasonal changes in the heterotrophic sediment microbial communities, their response to nutrient amendment, and in the groundwater chemistry from a fen discharge zone at Cedar Bog. The hypothesis that the microbial community in this fen upwelling is nutrient limited throughout the year, particularly by C and P, was tested. The activity of the heterotrophic bacterial community in the sediment compartment was measured. A series of single factor experiments were conducted to study organic and inorganic nutrient regulation of these communities and to determine what nutrients, if any, were limiting. Activities were based on H-3-thymidine incorporation into DNA by control and nutrient amended sediment slurries and verified with C-14-leucine incorporation into protein. Bacterial cell abundance was determined using Acridine Orange direct counts. Samples amended with carbon showed significant increases in activity in three of four seasons tested. Bog extract also stimulated activity above that of the control for the winter microcosm. The site bacterial activity also appears to be limited by inorganic nitrogen and possibly phosphorus in summer.

AB Permafrost thaw in continental lowlands produces large number of thermokarst (thaw) lakes, which act as a major regulator of carbon (C) storage in sediments and C emission in the atmosphere. Here we studied thaw lakes of the NE European permafrost peatlands - shallow water bodies located within frozen peat bogs and receiving the majority of their water input from lateral (surface) runoff. We also conducted mesocosm experiments via interacting lake waters with frozen peat and dominant ground vegetation - lichen and moss. There was a systematic decrease in concentrations of dissolved C, CO2, nutrients and metals with an increase in lake size, corresponding to temporal evolution of the water body and thermokarst development. We hypothesized that ground vegetation and frozen peat provide the majority of C, nutrients and inorganic solutes in the water column of these lakes, and that microbial processing of terrestrial organic matter controls the pattern of CO(2 )and nutrient concentrations in thermokarst lakes. Substrate mass-normalized C, nutrient (N, P. K), major and trace metal release was maximal in moss mesocosms. After first 16 h of reaction, the pCO(2) increased ten-fold in mesocosms with moss and lichen; this increase was much less pronounced in experiments with permafrost peat. Overall, moss and lichen were the dominant factors controlling the enrichment of the lake water in organic C. nutrients, and trace metals and rising the CO2 concentration. The global significance of obtained results is that the changes in ground vegetation, rather than mere frozen peat thawing, may exert the primary control on C, major and trace element balance in aquatic ecosystems of tundra peatlands under climate warming scenario.

AB Sediments and stratigraphy at the Tower Buried Forest site provide a glimpse into the immediate post-glacial environment of northern Lower Michigan, USA. At this site, sandy glacial outwash is overlain by (1) approximate to 37 cm of peat associated with a wetland, above which are (2) flat-lying spruce and larch logs and branches that date between approximate to 10 910 and 10 340 cal years BP. Above the woody materials are approximate to 55-75 cm of sand, interbedded with organic muck laminae, which we interpret as local alluvium. This stratigraphic sequence is overlain by muck soil materials associated with the modern wetland. Pollen and plant macrofossil analysis of the lower peat indicate that a tundra-boreal parkland had been established here, shortly after final deglaciation. Later, Picea glauca (white spruce), Picea mariana (black spruce), Larix laricina (larch), and Abies balsamea (balsam fir) became abundant in an open boreal forest - Spaghnum peatland. Subsequent increases in Pinus (pine) and Typha (cattail) indicate drying and possibly warming conditions. At ca. 10 340 cal years BP (or a few centuries prior), nearly two millennia after final deglaciation, water flowed across the site, possibly knocking over the trees.. Interbedded sand and muck deposits above the flat-lying logs are interpreted as alluvial deposits from this event, after which the wetland became quiescent again.

AB Response surfaces along gradients of water-table depth and water pH were obtained for the commonest vascular and bryophyte species in a nutrient-poor mire on the southern Alps of Italy. Depth to the water table was the major factor, whereas the chemical gradient was of lower importance in structuring vegetation. The distributional pattern of vascular plants is considered to be determined by physiological tolerance along the gradient in depth to the water table. Hence, interspecific competition in the field layer is considered of minor importance, except for interactions between ericaceous shrubs. Bryophytes probably interact to a greater extent, especially in lawns and carpets. Sphagnum species appear to be better competitors, as they almost totally exclude other mosses from those habitats. Interactions between species mainly result in dominance patterns, rather than in a clear habitat partitioning along the water-table gradient. Strong dominance by single species rather than clear habitat partitioning along the water-table gradient is interpreted as a result of interactions between species. Species showing ruderal traits are more typical of wet habitats (carpets and hollows), where disturbance is likely to play a major role in structuring the vegetation in the bottom layer.

AB Simulation of emissions of the greenhouse gas N2O from agricultural land is still a challenge. This is mainly due to its high temporal variability, with low background emissions and a few transient peaks. In this study, a first attempt was made to simulate observations of N2O fluxes with a daily time step from managed peat soils. We used a new N2O module added to the extensively tested hydrological-biogeochemical model combination SWAP-ANIMO, hypothesizing that accurate simulation of the controlling factors would imply accurate simulation of the dynamics of the N2O emissions as well. We used daily N2O emission data from three sites in the Netherlands, with complementary data on soil moisture, mineral N content, and soil N2O concentration. Simulation of soil moisture, mineral N, and N2O concentration was reasonable to good. Still, simulation of the daily N2O emissions was poor, with model efficiencies <0, mainly due to overestimation of N2O emission from denitrification in the topsoil. We expect that the model overestimated diffusion of N2O from the topsoil to the atmosphere, thereby underestimating further reductions of N2O to N-2. This was probably linked to the complex peat pore geometry. We concluded that the description of the N2O processes in our model was insufficient to accurately simulate daily N2O emissions from peat soils, even when the main controlling factors are accurately simulated. Improvement is expected from incorporation of the effects of (peat) pore geometry on soil moisture and consequently on N2O production, reduction, storage, and transport.

AB The input and output flux data of total Hg (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) from three catchments located in different geographical regions in Sweden and one catchment in southern Finland were compared to elucidate the role of current atmospheric Hg/MeHg deposition with regard to waterborne Hg/MeHg output.
   There was a negative co-variaton between the open field THg inputs and the ratio of THg output to open field input. The highest ratio (and lowest input) occurring in N. Sweden and S. Finland, while the lowest output ratio (and highest inputs) occurred in southwest Sweden. A much larger variation was found in the ratio of output to open field input for MeHg (14 to 160%). Examinations of MeHg input/output data in relation to catchment charateristics suggest that riparian peat, mires and wet organic soil contributed to the large MeHg output from certain catchments, probably due to in situ production of MeHg. This finding is consistent with other studies which have found that catchment characteristics such as wetland area, flow pathways, seasonal temperature and water flow are important in controlling the output of MeHg. These catchment characteristics govern the fate of the contemporary input of Hg and MeHg as well as the mobilization of the soil pools.

AB A suite of autogenic ecohydrological feedbacks and moss traits are important for protecting vast peatland carbon stocks following wildfire disturbance. Here, we examine how peat burn severity and water table depth (WTD) affect the strength of one such feedback-the hydrophobicity-evaporation feedback (HEF). The HEF is an evaporation-limiting feedback known to minimize water loss following wildfire. The peatland surface becomes hydrophobic creating an evaporative cap and thereby reducing post-fire evaporation; however, recent studies hypothesize that this is dependent on peat burn severity. To test this hypothesis, we studied plots along a peat burn severity gradient in a partially drained black spruce peatland that burned during the 2016 Fort McMurray Horse River wildfire. Evaporation rates were significantly lower in plots where hydrophobicity was present. Hydrophobicity was lowest in the severely burned area, and the average instantaneous evaporation rate (2.75 mm day(-1)) was significantly higher than moderately and typical-lightly burned areas (0.82 and 1.64 mm day(-1), respectively). Based on lab results, increasing WTD affected hydrophobicity within lightly burned (singed) feather moss samples but not in heavily burned feather moss, showing the importance of post-fire ground cover and in situ WTD. Our results provide evidence of a burn severity threshold where increased depth of burn removes the feather moss evaporative cap and causes the HEF to break down. We argue that this threshold has important implications for boreal peatlands, which are predicted to undergo climate-mediated pre-fire drying and increasing burn severities, potentially leading to further carbon losses due to enhanced post-fire drying and concomitant decomposition.

AB Peatlands are habitats for a range of fragile flora and fauna species. Their eco-physicochemical characteristics make them as outstanding global carbon and water storage systems. These ecosystems occupy 3% of the worldwide emerged land surface but represent 30% of the global organic soil carbon and 10% of the global fresh water volumes. In such systems, carbon speciation depends to a large extent on specific redox conditions which are mainly governed by the depth of the water table. Hence, understanding their hydrological variability, that conditions both their ecological and biogeochemical functions, is crucial for their management, especially when anticipating their future evolution under climate change. This study illustrates how long-term monitoring of basic hydro-meteorological parameters combined with statistical modeling can be used as a tool to evaluate i) the horizontal (type of peat), ii) vertical (acrotelm/catotelm continuum) and iii) future hydrological variability. Using cross-correlations between meteorological data (precipitation, potential evapotranspiration) and water table depth (WTD), we primarily highlight the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological reactivity across the Sphagnumdominated Frasne peatland (French Jura Mountain). Then, a multiple linear regression model allows performing hydrological projections until 2100, according to regionalized IPCC RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Although WTD re-mains stable during the first half of 21th century, seasonal trends beyond 2050 show lower WTD in winter and markedly greater WTD in summer. In particular, after 2050, more frequent droughts in summer and autumn should occur, increasing WTD. These projections are completed with risk evaluations for peatland droughts until 2100 that appear to be increasing especially for transition seasons, i.e. May-June and September-October. Comparing these trends with previous evaluations of phenol concentrations in water throughout the vegetative period, considered as a proxy of plant functioning intensity, highlights that these hydrological modifications during transitional seasons could be a great ecological perturbation, especially by affecting Sphagnum metabolism.

AB Microbial communities are important to ecosystem function and sensitive to hydrological dynamics. However, we lack predictable knowledge about how soil microorganisms respond to water table drawdown in different depths. This research used a high-throughput sequencing method to determine the responses of prokaryotic communities to the changes of water table and depth on Zoige peatlands. Our results showed that water table drawdown reduced alpha diversity indices (observed species, Shannon diversity and Chao1 richness) of prokaryotic communities. Intriguingly, the reduction of diversity varied in different depths, and was statistically significant in intermediate layers (20-30 cm and 50- 60 cm), but not in the surface (0-10 cm) or deep layer (90-100 cm). In deeper layers there was greater relative abundance of most anaerobic microorganisms (e.g. Chloroflexi, Planctomyctes and NC10), but lesser amounts of most aerobes (e.g. Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria). However, the vertical distribution of prokaryotic microbiota along the depth gradient was altered by water table drawdown, mainly by enriching oligotrophs (e.g. Acidobcteria) over copiotrophs (e.g. Bacteriodetes). In addition, we found that the most important soil parameters influencing community structure were soil pH, total organic carbon and total nitrogen. Our study illuminates that the variations of prokaryotic communities caused by water table drawdown are depth-dependent, and that water table drawdown leads to predictive changes of microbiota in peatlands.

AB Understanding the controls on carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange within saline boreal fens, appropriate natural analogs for landscape reclamation in areas affected by salinization in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region, can provide insights into the biogeochemical and carbon sink functioning of constructed wetlands under saline conditions. Hence, this study aims to assess net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (R), and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) of peatland and open-water areas within a saline boreal fen near Fort McMurray (Alberta, Canada) to determine environmental controls on CO(2)fluxes using community-scale CO(2)measurements along a salinity gradient. Strong positive correlations between NEE, GEP, leaf area index within peatland, and between GEP and vegetation density within open-water areas (ponds) were observed, demonstrating the importance of vegetation properties for carbon uptake. Strong negative correlations were found between NEE, GEP, R and water table depth and electrical conductivity within peatland. In contrast, GEP and R were positively correlated with phosphate concentrations in ponds, and electrical conductivity had no effect on CO(2)fluxes within ponds. In peatlands, links between CO(2)exchange and environmental factors were influenced by microtopography, and complex relationships between NEE, GEP, R and environmental variables were observed within depressions.

AB Northern peatlands store approximately one third of the global soil carbon (C) stocks. Peat extraction for horticulture changes C fluxes turning these soils from sinks into large sources of C emitted to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases. Restoring hydrological conditions may not be enough for returning the C sink function of these ecosystems and a recovery of the original Sphagnum-dominated vegetation cover could be necessary. Here we tested the effects of the moss layer-transfer technique (MLTT) on the CO2 and CH4 fluxes three years after restoration of a minerotrophic cutover peatland in Quebec, Canada. Gas emissions were compared to nearby undisturbed plots, and plots with restored hydrology but without vegetation transfer. The main drivers for the observed emissions were inferred from the relationships with relevant environmental variables (vegetation cover, water table depth and temperature). Restoration of the extracted minerotrophic fen through the MLTT produced significant changes in the exchange of CO2, bringing these fluxes closer to undisturbed plots than plots with restored hydrology only, which remained C sources throughout the study. Methane emissions were generally low across all the restored plots and far from natural levels, with only a slight increase at the MLTT restored plots observed during the third year. Even though the MLTT failed to recover the original bryophyte-dominated vegetation, the observed changes in the emissions of CO2 and CH4 at the restored plots were strongly associated with changes in vegetation cover (i.e. increase in vascular plants), supporting the use of this restoration technique to recover the C sink function of harvested minerotrophic peatlands.

AB The controls on methane (CH4) bubbling (ebullition) from peatlands are uncertain, but evidence suggests that physical factors related to gas transport and storage within the peat matrix are important. Variability in peat pore size and the permeability of layers within peat can produce ebullition that ranges from steady to erratic in time and can affect the degree to which CH4 bubbles bypass consumption by methanotrophic bacteria and enter the atmosphere. Here we investigate the role of peat structure on ebullition in structurally different peats using a physical model that replicates bubble production using air injection into peat. We find that the frequency distributions of number of ebullition events per time and the magnitude of bubble loss from the physical model were similar in shape to ebullition from peatlands and incubated peats. This indicates that the physical model could be a valid proxy for naturally occurring ebullition from peat. For the first time, data on bubble sizes from peat were collected to conceptualize ebullition, and we find that peat structure affects bubble sizes. Using a new method to measure peat macrostructure, we collected evidence that supports the hypothesis that structural differences in peat determine if bubble release is steady or erratic and extreme. Collected pore size data suggest that erratic ebullition occurs when large amounts of gas stored at depth easily move through shallower layers of open peat. In contrast, steady ebullition occurs when dense shallower layers of peat regulate the flow of gas emitted from peat.

AB Hydrogeologic setting strongly influences the hydrologic function of peatland systems. For base-rich fens in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) of the Western Boreal Plain, northern Alberta, local groundwater flow from gently sloping adjacent uplands has been shown to help sustain fen water tables and chemistry. Natural forest disturbance in the AOSR is dominated by wildfire, with peatlands susceptible to combustion and subsequent carbon release. However, few studies have aimed to characterize the degree of change to the hydrophysical properties of upland soils following wildfire. To address this, we measured differences in water repellency and hydrophysical properties of burned and unburned upland organic and mineral soils in a burned moderate-rich fen watershed (Poplar Fen), similar to 25 km north of Fort McMurray. Samples were taken in the fall of 2017, similar to 1.5 years after the watershed burned (May 2016). Study locations included burned and unburned jack pine-dominated upland and black spruce-dominated riparian areas. Results illustrated significantly lower water repellency and higher infiltration on burned locations of both land types. Furthermore, no significant differences were detected in organic soil moisture retention in uplands; however, burned organic soil samples had significantly lower water retention in riparian areas. We postulate the lower water retention in riparian areas was due to the greater organic layer thickness there, thus greater fuel load and potential for exceeding the temperature threshold of repellency destruction. Following retention, all soil cores exhibited high hysteresis, with differences in volumetric moisture content averaging 0.38 and 0.34 m(3) m(-3) at -10 cm pressure for upland and riparian locations, respectively. Our results are contrary to the increased hydrophobicity following burning that is commonly reported in boreal regions. The promoted infiltration, groundwater recharge and subsequent enhanced water supply to fens in the local groundwater system may help in accelerating the moss recovery process.

AB It is widely known that peatlands are a significant carbon (C) stock. Most peatlands are located in boreal and subarctic regions of the northern hemisphere but some occur also at high altitude and, contrary to the first; their contribution in terms of carbon sequestration is far less studied. In the Alps, there are numerous small peatlands, which are threatened by increasing temperatures and an alteration of their water balance. The aim of this study was to investigate the carbon fluxes of a small-scale fen in the Alps over three years (2012-2014).
   During the study period, the peatland experienced a high interannual variation in weather conditions while it acted as a carbon source based on CO2 emissions (NEE: 180.7 +/- 65.2 g C-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)) for all three years. This was mainly due to the short net C uptake period (73 7 days) and high respiration. Ecosystem respiration and summer gross primary production were both very high compared to other peatlands around the world and compared to a nearby low productive grassland. In wintertime, the soil did not freeze, resulting in a slow decomposition of the organic matter. Low methane fluxes were recorded during a 10-month measurement campaign, for a total of 3.2 g C-CH4 m(-2) over the December 2013-September 2014 period. Our findings suggest that the interannual variability of temperature and soil water content exert a strong influence on the carbon balance of peatlands of the Alps and that could further worsen depending upon the magnitude of climate change.

AB Peatlands are widely exploited archives of paleoenvironmental change. We developed and compared multiple transfer functions to infer peatland depth to the water table (DWT) and pH based on testate amoeba (percentages, or presence/absence), bryophyte presence/absence, and vascular plant presence/absence data from sub-alpine peatlands in the SE Swiss Alps in order to 1) compare the performance of single-proxy vs. multi-proxy models and 2) assess the performance of presence/absence models. Bootstrapping cross-validation showing the best performing single-proxy transfer functions for both DWT and pH were those based on bryophytes. The best performing transfer functions overall for DWF were those based on combined testate amoebae percentages, bryophytes and vascular plants; and, for pH, those based on testate amoebae and bryophytes. The comparison of DWT and pH inferred from testate amoeba percentages and presence/absence data showed similar general patterns but differences in the magnitude and timing of some shifts. These results show new directions for paleoenvironmental research, 1) suggesting that it is possible to build good-performing transfer functions using presence/absence data, although with some loss of accuracy, and 2) supporting the idea that multi-proxy inference models may improve paleoecological reconstruction. The performance of multi-proxy and single-proxy transfer functions should be further compared in paleoecological data. (C) 2012 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Phosphorus (P) losses from terrestrial soils contribute to eutrophication of surface waters. As priority non-point source pollution ways, rainfall runoff (RS1) and snowmelt runoff (RS2) are the main carrier of P loss from terrestrial ecosystem. The aim of this study was to investigate the similarities and differences between P loss with RS1 and RS2 of the same soil type. Six types of soil were used in this experiment. Results have shown that 1), Different types of soil have different P loss with RS1 and RS2 under different slope, and the changes ranged from 0.003 to 0.370 mg L-1. 2), The effects of soil type, slope and runoff type on P loss with surface runoff was not independent, both individual effects of all factors and their interaction with the other two factors effected the P loss with runoff. 3), In our experiment, some soils showed no significant difference between P content in RS1 and RS2. In some soils, P loss with RS1 was higher than that with RS2 while the opposite conclusion was showed in Bog soil (BS) which with higher soil water content. 4), The P loss with RS1 and RS2 of different soils were both mainly affected by soil water content (SW), Olsen-P content (OP) and soil organic matter content (OM). These results can help us understand the P loss with different patterns of surface runoff better and are expected to provide pertinent opinions on the analysis of P loss with runoff and its influencing factors of grassland soils.

AB In southern South America, a sharp macroclimatic gradient is found, triggered by the Pacific oceanic influence through the Andes. Mires are substantial landscape units along the gradient, where they play varying roles through the area and include varying plant communities. In this study, we analysed the relationship between vegetation and main abiotic factors in the minerotrophic mires (fens) at two different scales. We chose three fens in Isla Grande from Cordillera and Magellanic Steppe zones and their ecotone. There we characterized the distinct habitats by means of monitoring the water table fluctuations, the peat and the groundwater chemistry, and the vascular plant species composition. The main floristic patterns were revealed by means of classification and ordination of 75 vegetation plots. Thus, we classified the releves through multivariate analyses into six plant community types, two of which found in each fen. Behind the floristic distinctiveness of each site and each community type, structural vegetation descriptors such as species richness were similar. Overall, water table variables and groundwater chemistry showed the most important environmental differences between fens. Our data point that the main environmental force driving vegetation patterns was the macroclimatic gradient, which shapes the regional floristic pools. This gradient would be also responsible for modifying the local conditions of the fen habitats, mostly in the form of broadening the hydrological conditions within the fens of the Steppe. At each fen, the hydrological regime is the main factor in the distribution of vascular plants, particularly through the varying water table depths.

AB For implementation of sustainable land use strategies in Europe tools for evaluating long-term changes of peatland functions are essential. Therefore a semi-quantitative peatland management decision support system for agricultural used peatlands in Europe was developed. It is called Peatland Management Decision Support System (PMDSS). The aim of the tool is to better understand and to forecast long-term processes in peatland ecosystems in order to help scientists, water boards and environmental agencies in decision making about long-term management. PMDSS is based on derived indicators of ecosystem functions of peatlands, which are: harvest of plant products, land use category, mean summer water table (MSWT), nitrogen discharge, Global Warming Potential (GWP) and conservation value of plants. PMDSS is realized as an easy to use spreadsheet program in Excel. The model is one-dimensional and applicable for a site or field, where the input parameters, particularly land use category, vegetation type and MSWT are relatively homogenous. It is running with annual intervals and for a time span of 100 years (vegetation 50 years). Results are presented as values, text and diagrams. PMDSS is accessible via internet.
   PMDSS was applied to sites in several European countries. A case study in the Eider Valley peatland is presented, which is typical for Weichselian landscapes of northwest Germany. The site has a deep peat layer and is mainly influenced by groundwater discharge. It was used as a meadow and pasture during the past centuries and is left abandoned since the mid 1990s. Effects of different land use and water management scenarios onto the development of the site are determined. The scenarios are typical for peatland sites in northwest Germany and northwest Europe. Results are plausible as a rough estimate of magnitude and development trend. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CYLINDRICAL PIEZOMETERS; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; HYDROLOGY; PEATLAND
AB Standpipe piezometers are often used in wetland hydrologic studies for measuring pore-water pressures and, therefore, hydraulic heads. Here, we consider the errors associated with the use of simple standpipe piezometers in wetland soils. The performance of two typical piezometer designs was assessed. Rather than measure the performance of the piezometer designs in the field, we modelled their response to computer-generated changes in pore-water pressures for three 'model' floodplain soils. We showed that for some piezometer design/soil-type combinations, standpipe piezometers can be in considerable error. Greatest errors were found where the less efficient of the two piezometer designs (standpipe inside diameter = 5 cm, outside diameter of intake = 5.6 cm, intake length = 5 cm) was in a poorly permeable silt deposit (hydraulic conductivity = 6 cm d(-1)) overlain by a permeable sand (hydraulic conductivity = 210 cm d(-1)). If undetected, these errors could lead wetland researchers and/or consultants to make erroneous conclusions about both patterns and rates of ground-water flow in wetland soils. In field investigations, we recommend that selective use is made of rapidly responding piezometers, such as closed hydraulic piezometers, so that the performance of standpipe piezometers can be assessed.

AB Enhanced nutrient export from blanket peats and other peat soils after forest harvesting has been reported by several studies. As part of forest practices on afforested blanket peat, harvest residues are utilized as brash mats to improve the soil carrying capacity against heavy machinery to extract the harvested timber to the roadside, before being collected together to form brash windrows, between which the second rotation trees are planted. Three types of experiments were conducted to assess the impact of brash windrows, derived from lodgepole pine forests, on phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) release in blanket peat catchments. First, a field survey was conducted in 6 sites to study the easily extractable P and N contents in soil below brash windrows and respective brash free areas. The dynamics of N and P release when water flows from a windrow to a brash-free area was assessed using laboratory flume studies. Finally, the role of windrows in N and P export to adjacent watercourses under field conditions was assessed using artificially isolated mini-catchments with and without harvest residues. The study showed that windrows in blanket peat catchments are a significant source of P release to soil and soil water underneath and act as hot spots for P export to receiving waters. The windrows may act as a sink rather than a source for N during the early stages of their decomposition. However, more N was exported from brash-covered than brash-free areas, the probable reason being that microbial activity and soil N mineralization was increased under brash. Forest management options other than windrowing brash should be developed and studied to decrease N and P release and transport to watercourses from blanket peat catchments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background and aims Boreal peatlands are projected to face numerous stressors in the future, including changes in precipitation and nitrogen cycle perturbations. Nitrogen is currently believed to be the limiting factor to peatlands of western Canada, including to Sphagnum, however new insights suggest the possibility of multiple limiting factors.
   Methods Growth, nitrogen assimilation, and annual retention of Sphagnum angustifolium, a species with a broad niche, were observed across a depth to water table gradient for three years to further understand the partitioning of key limiting factors.
   Results Within each year differences of linear growth were responsible for variations in net primary production (NPP), yet yearly differences of NPP were attributed to annual differences in bulk density. Sphagnum angustifolium on the wet end of the depth to water gradient is characterized as nitrogen limited with high growth and low N concentrations, compared to less growth and high N concentrations at the water limiting dry end. Of the nitrogen that is annually assimilated by S. angustifolium, approximately 1.3 g N m(-2) is lost from biomass one year subsequent to assimilation, demonstrating the rapid turnover of this nutrient.
   Conclusion The depth to water table gradient is strongly related to many S. angustifolium growth parameters and is a pivotal mechanism in delineating limiting factors within a single complex peatland ecosystem.

AB Testate amoebae are a group of moisture-sensitive, shell-producing protozoa that have been widely used as indicators of changes in mean water-table depth within oligotrophic peatlands. However, short-term environmental variability (i.e., sub-annual) also probably influences community composition. The objective of this study was to assess the potential influence of short-term environmental variability on the composition of testate amoeba communities in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. Testate amoebae and environmental conditions, including hourly measurements of relative humidity within the upper centimeter of the peatland surface, were examined throughout the 2008 growing season at 72 microsites within 11 peatlands of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, USA. Relationships among testate amoeba communities, vegetation, depth to water table, pH, and an index of short-term environmental variability (EVI), were examined using nonmetric multidimensional scaling and correlation analysis. Results suggest that EVI influences testate amoeba communities, with some taxa more abundant under highly variable conditions (e.g., Arcella discoides, Difflugia pulex, and Hyalosphenia subflava) and others more abundant when environmental conditions at the peatland surface were relatively stable (e.g., Archerella flavum and Bullinularia indica). The magnitude of environmental variability experienced at the peatland surface appears to be primarily controlled by vegetation composition and density. In particular, sites with dense Sphagnum cover had lower EVI values than sites with loose-growing Sphagnum or vegetation dominated by vascular plants and/or non-Sphagnum bryophytes. Our results suggest that more environmental information may be inferred from testate amoebae than previously recognized. Knowledge of relationships between testate amoebae and short-term environmental variability should lead to more detailed and refined environmental inferences.

AB Forty percentage of UK peatlands have been drained for agricultural use, which has caused serious peat wastage and associated greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)). In this study, we evaluated potential trade-offs between water-table management practices for minimizing peat wastage and greenhouse gas emissions, while seeking to sustain romaine lettuce production: one of the most economically relevant crop in the East Anglian Fenlands. In a controlled environment experiment, we measured lettuce yield, CO2, CH4 fluxes and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released from an agricultural fen soil at two temperatures (ambient and +2 degrees C) and three water-table levels (-30 cm, -40 cm and -50 cm below the surface). We showed that increasing the water table from the currently used field level of -50 cm to -40 cm and -30 cm reduced CO2 emissions, did not affect CH4 fluxes, but significantly reduced yield and increased DOC leaching. Warming of 2 degrees C increased both lettuce yield (fresh leaf biomass) and peat decomposition through the loss of carbon as CO2 and DOC. However, there was no difference in the dry leaf biomass between the intermediate (-40 cm) and the low (-50 cm) water table, suggesting that romaine lettuce grown at this higher water level should have similar energetic value as the crop cultivated at -50 cm, representing a possible compromise to decrease peat oxidation and maintain agricultural production.

AB The late Holocene (from 3500 yr BP to present) in eastern North America is characterised by a marked rise of water levels in lakes and by the accumulation of numerous peat bogs. According to a number of researchers, this could be due to an increase in winter precipitations that would have resulted in large water volumes released by snowmelt, inducing groundwater recharge and rise of water bodies such as lakes and aquifers. This hypothesis seems to be confirmed by stratigraphical studies of small alluvial fans in Quebec. Radiocarbon dates from four small alluvial fans in the Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gaspesie regions indicate that these fans have been formed in the last 3500 years, due to an increase in forest runoff associated with spring snowmelt.

AB The lake-rich glacial landscapes of north-eastern central Europe play an important role in the preservation and use of water resources, including protection of biodiversity, carbon storage and promotion of tourism. With a view to the last c. 20 years and the future, a regional 'syndrome of water shortage' has been frequently stated, which impairs particularly peatlands, flowing waters and lakes. Accordingly, the overall question addressed in this study is: What can regional and local gauging records tell us about decadal hydrological changes of lakes and their catchments? In the study area, most of the gauging records of lakes begin only in the late 1990s. Forty-five lake-level records were analysed by hierarchical agglomerative clustering, looking for the trend in the 1999-2008 time window. The analyses show that lake levels had varying dynamics, namely a negative, unclear or even a positive trend. The proportional shares of these three groups are 23 (51 %) to 15 (34 %) to 7 lakes (15 %), respectively. In group 1, largely groundwater-fed lakes, lake-level changes depend on groundwater-level changes. These are controlled by decreasing groundwater recharge in the catchments, which are caused by specific seasonal weather conditions in the observation period, and the impact of the dominating pine forests, which consume high quantities of water. In group 2, mainly stream lakes, direct human impact drives the lake levels through the management of weirs and ground sills. Nearly all lakes in group 3, consisting of river, stream and spring lakes, were subject to impoundment measures initiated by local rewetting projects. Thus, an important finding with respect to the impact of climate and land use is the fact that the ('natural') lakes of the region, primarily fed by groundwater and precipitation, show a predominantly negative lake-level trend in the period studied. Beyond the 10-year-time window analysed, further regional data show that periodic lake-level fluctuations with amplitudes of c. 1-2(-3) m are characteristic for regional groundwater-fed lakes.

AB The factors affecting the adaptation of downy birch (Betula pubescens) to different environmental conditions were studied in 2002-2003 by measurement of the production characteristics of saplings, which were experimentally planted in contrasting habitats at a cut-away peatland in the Sumava Mts., Czech Republic. These habitats varied in groundwater table depth. Together with this factor, we tested for the effect of shading, using shade cloth, on sapling growth. We conducted a greenhouse manipulative experiment to investigate the growth response of the downy birch saplings to varying groundwater table depths and soil types. We examined whether spatial distribution of naturally established birch stems changes along pronounced moisture gradient represented by transects placed at three distances from draining ditches. In the field, birch plants exhibited higher growth increments as well as higher leaf production under high groundwater table depth. This result is the opposite of the manipulated greenhouse experiment, which showed higher biomass increments for saplings under the low groundwater table depth. This was probably because downy birch, in principle, indicates terrestrification of peat bogs and high water table depth in greenhouse inhibited its growth. In field, birch saplings were probably stressed by drought. Positive shading effect on sapling growth was proven by leaf production measurements. The two term local variance method (TTLQV) revealed two contrasting dispersion patterns, for the birch population at drier and wetter sites of the post-mined peatbog. The aggregation was clear mainly at the drier site with lower abundance of birch plants within each sampled square. Higher abundance of individuals were found in squares of the wetter site, whereas the pattern was random there.

AB Peat compression can significantly alter the hydraulic parameters that govern flow and storage of water. Physical properties of peat (bulk density, state of decomposition (von Post number, vP) and fibre content) were assessed to determine whether they can be used as indicators of peat compressibility. Bulk density and vP were related to each other (positively), and within a given core were related (negatively) to compressibility. Peat from different locations exhibited different compressibility characteristics for a given value of bulk density or vP. Fibre content was unrelated to bulk density, vP, or to peat compressibility. It was concluded that more commonly and relatively easily measured soil parameters are not good indicators of soil compressibility. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Artificial drainage networks established throughout peatlands during the peat extraction process often remain active following abandonment, maintaining a water table relatively far from the surface of the peat, and hindering the survival and reestablishment of Sphagnum mosses. As an initial restoration effort, the primary drainage network of an abandoned cutover peatland was blocked with a series of peat dams, consequently reducing the runoff efficiency and causing the site-average water table to rise by 32 cm. Higher water tables and a blocked drainage network resulted in increased runoff variability, dependent upon antecedent conditions (capacity to retain additional water on-site), and event-based precipitation dynamics. Evapotranspiration (ET) rates were 25% higher following rewetting (3.6 mm day(-1)) compared to pre-restoration ET rates of 2.7 mm day(-1). Total storage changes were restricted following rewetting, as a factor of the reduced runoff losses limiting water table drawdown, thereby constraining peat compression and preventing undue drying of the unsaturated zone. An average surface level rebound of 3 cm was observed, increasing the mean hydraulic conductivity by an order of magnitude. Changes to the system hydrology following restoration efforts produced hydrological conditions more favourable for the recolonization of Sphagnum mosses.

AB During the past similar to 50 years, the number and area of lakes have declined in several regions in boreal forests. However, there has been substantial finer-scale heterogeneity; some lakes decreased in area, some showed no trend, and others increased. The objective of this study was to identify the primary mechanisms underlying heterogeneous trends in closed-basin lake area. Eight lake characteristics (delta O-18, electrical conductivity, surface : volume index, bank slope, floating mat width, peat depth, thaw depth at shoreline, and thaw depth at the forest boundary) were compared for 15 lake pairs in Alaskan boreal forest where one lake had decreased in area since similar to 1950, and the other had not. Mean differences in characteristics between paired lakes were used to identify the most likely of nine mechanistic scenarios that combined three potential mechanisms for decreasing lake area (talik drainage, surface water evaporation, and terrestrialization) with three potential mechanisms for nondecreasing lake area (subpermafrost groundwater recharge through an open talik, stable permafrost, and thermokarst). A priori expectations of the direction of mean differences between decreasing and nondecreasing paired lakes were generated for each scenario. Decreasing lakes had significantly greater electrical conductivity, greater surface : volume indices, shallower bank slopes, wider floating mats, greater peat depths, and shallower thaw depths at the forest boundary. These results indicated that the most likely scenario was terrestrialization as the mechanism for lake area reduction combined with thermokarst as the mechanism for nondecreasing lake area. Terrestrialization and thermokarst may have been enhanced by recent warming which has both accelerated permafrost thawing and lengthened the growing season, thereby increasing plant growth, floatingmat encroachment, transpiration rates, and the accumulation of organic matter in lake basins. The transition to peatlands associated with terrestrialization may provide a transient increase in carbon storage enhancing the role of northern ecosystems as major stores of global carbon.

AB Forest harvesting activities on peatlands have long been associated with nutrient leaching and deterioration of downstream water quality. This study aims to assess the effect of grass seeding practice on harvested blanket peatlands to immobilize N and reduce its export to water courses. First, a plot-scale field experiment was conducted by seeding with two grass species (Holcus lanatus and Agrostis capillaris) to study the N uptake potential from a harvested area. Secondly, a simulated rainfall experiment was conducted to study the effect of these grasses on reducing N leaching from surface peat using laboratory flume approach. In the end, the role of seeded grasses in removing N from nutrient-rich throughflow water was assessed using simulated overland flow experiment. The results showed that the seeded grasses had the potential to uptake over 30 kg ha(-1) of N in the first year after seeding on harvested peatlands, whereas it takes over 2.5 years to establish the same level of N uptake by natural re-vegetation (non-grassed). In the simulated rainfall experiment, the inorganic N (NH4+-N and NO3--N) leaching in surface runoff from grassed flumes was 72% lower (453 mg m(-2)) than non-grassed flumes (1643 mg m(-2)). In the simulated overland flow experiment, the N retention by grassed flumes was significantly higher (98%) as compared to non-grassed flumes (70%) in the simulated overland flow experiment. Comparatively higher concentrations of NH4+-N and NO3--N in soil porewaters of non-grassed flumes suggest that this N retention by non-grassed flumes is less sustainable and is likely to be leached in runoff in subsequent flow events. The results from all three experiments in this study suggest that seeded grasses are a major sink of N on harvested blanket peatland forests. Immobilization of N onsite using the grass seeding and mini-buffer practice could be an efficient and a feasible mean of reducing N export from harvested blanket peatland forests in order to protect the sensitive water courses. However, the sustainability of retention and immobilization of N by grasses needs to be studied further in long-term field-scale experiments on multiple peatland sites.

DT Article
ID DRAINAGE
AB (1) Water-table depths on high-level blanket bog were compared at different distances from moor-drains and with depths on nearby undrained bog.  Cover-abundances of ten plant species were compared with the results for water-tables.
   (2) Water-table depths fluctuated with rainfall, but less so beside drains than farther away, and less than on undrained bog.
   (3) Mean water-tables near to drains were lower than at places farther away, but the lowering was slight and confined to a zone only a few metres wide on either side of the drain.  On sloping ground, the zone was narrower on the uphill side than the downhill side.
   (4) Plant species dependent on high water-tables had lower cover-abundance near to drains, and species with drier heathland affinities had higher cover than at places farther away.  As with water-tables, this effect was asymmetrical, but more so; several species showed altered cover on the downslope side alone.
   (5) Vegetation data for one site over 25 years showed that most long-term effects were confined to the downslope side of drains.  Cover of Calluna peaked after 8 years but declined thereafter, while declines in cover of Sphagnum were highly localized and took nearly 20 years to achieve statistical significance.
   (6) The conclusion is that drains acted mainly to intercept surface run-off, and withdrew water from the peat only alongside the drain edge.  Run-off entering the drain from above reduced or nullified plant responses to the water-table on the upslope side, and the reduced run-off below the drain enhanced the response there.

AB We compared the seasonal patterns of sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium concentrations, pH, and electrical conductivity in pore water in a nutrient-poor mire of the southern Alps to precipitation chemistry, water-table depth, and potential evapotranspiration, with the main objective to unravel differences between pore-water chemistry in hummock and hollow habitats. Sodium concentrations in mire water were primarily determined by precipitation inputs, with highest values in spring. Potassium concentrations were dependent on vegetation uptake, peaking before the growing season started, and showing lowest values in summer. Calcium and magnesium concentrations were highest in summer. Cation-exchange processes, evaporation, and humification affected the periodicity of bivalent cations. The pH decreased from spring to autumn, gradually in hollow water and more abruptely in hummock water. Electrical conductivity followed the bivalent cation concentration pattern both in hummocks and hollows.

   HISTORY
AB The mid to late-Holocene climates of most of Scotland have been reconstructed from seven peat bogs located across north-south and east-west geographical and climatological gradients. The main techniques used for palaeoclimatic reconstruction were plant macrofossil, colorimetric humification, and testate amoebae analyses, which were supported by a radiocarbon-based chronology, aided by markers such as tephra isochrons and recent rises in pine pollen and in spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs). Field stratigraphy was undertaken at each site in order to show that the changes detected within the peat profiles were replicable. Proxy climate records were reconstructed using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) of the plant rnacrofossil data and a mean water table depth transfer function on the testate amoebae data. These reconstructions, coupled with the humification data, were standardised for each site and used to produce a composite record of bog surface wetness (BSW) from each site. The results show coherent wet and dry phases over the last 5000 years and suggest regional differences in climate across Scotland, specifically between northern and southern Scotland. Distinct climatic cycles are identified, all of which record a millennial-scale periodicity which can be correlated with previously identified marine and ice core Holocene cycles. The key role of the macrofossil remains of Sphagnum imbricatum, a taxon now extinct on many sites, is discussed in relation to the identified climatic shifts.

ID BIOTOPE QUALITY; INDICATORS; CONSERVATION; FAUNA; LAKES
AB Larvae of almost all of the 5,680 species of the insect order Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) are dependent on freshwater habitats. Both larvae and adults are predators. The order is relatively well studied, and the actual number of species may be close to 7,000. Many species have small distributional ranges, and are habitat specialists, including inhabitants of alpine mountain bogs, seepage areas in tropical rain forests, and waterfalls. They are often successfully used as indicators for environmental health and conservation management. The highest diversity is found in flowing waters in rain forests of the tropics, the Oriental and Neotropical regions being the most speciose. This paper discusses diversity, summarises the biogeography of dragonflies in the different biogeographical regions and gives the total number of species and genera per family per biogeographical region. Examples are given of areas of particular diversity, in terms of areas of endemism, presence of ancient lineages or remarkable recent radiations but no well-based review of areas with high endemism of dragonflies is available so far. The conservation status of dragonflies is briefly discussed. Species confined to small remnants of forest in the tropics are most under threat of extinction by human activities.

AB Peatlands are common in many parts of the world. Draining and other changes in the use of peatlands increase atmospheric CO2 concentration. If we are to make reliable quantitative predictions of that effect, we need good information on the CO2 emission rates from peatlands. The present study uses two different methods for predicting CO2-C release of peatland soils: (i) a 40-year field investigation of balancing organic carbon stocks and (ii) short-term CO2-C release rates from laboratory experiments. To estimate long-term losses of peat, and its resulting C input to the atmosphere, we combined highly detailed maps of surface topography and its changes, and the organic C contents and bulk densities of a drained peatland from different years. Short-term CO2-C release rates were measured in the laboratory by incubating soil samples from several soil horizons at various temperatures and soil moistures. We then derived nonlinear CO2-C production functions, which we incorporated into a numerical simulation model (HYDRUS). Using HYDRUS, we calculated daily soil water components and CO2-release for (i) real-climate data from 1950 to 2003 and (ii) a climate scenario extending to 2050, including an increase in temperature of 2 degrees C and 20% less rainfall during the summer half year, i.e. from April to September inclusive. From our field measurements, we found a mean annual decrease of 0.7 cm in the thickness of the peat. Large losses (> 1.5 cm year(-1)) occurred only during periods when groundwater levels were low (i.e. a deep water-table). The annual CO2-C release results in a mean loss from the peat of about 700 g CO2-C m(-2), mostly as a direct contribution to the atmosphere. Both methods produced very similar results. The model scenarios demonstrated that CO2-C loss is mainly controlled by the groundwater (i.e. water-table) depth, which controls subsurface aeration. A local climate scenario estimated a c. 5% increase of CO2-C losses within the next 50 years.

Soil Sci. 89: 301-313 New legislation to reduce the amount of fertilizer leached into the environment by horticultural growers and the need to implement water-saving irrigation systems require an understanding of salt build-up and of nutrient cycles in order to develop efficient water-use strategies for growers. Solute transport in growing media is central to this process, but has received little attention thus far. The objectives of this study were to determine how solutes behave in sub-irrigated growing media and to assess a solute transport model for these media. A steady state evaporation (upward water flow) experiment was carried out with three different growing media in packed columns in the laboratory. Bromide, potassium and copper concentrations were determined using in-column pore water solution samplers and by sectioning the columns at the end of the experiment to obtain concentration profiles. The Hydrus-1D model was fitted to the solution sampler data assuming non-linear Freundlich adsorption, and then used to obtain favorable predictions of the measured concentration profiles. Independent adsorption isotherm results from batch experiments were found to be inadequate when used to predict Solute movement and the results indicate that the preferred approach is an in-column evaluation of the transport parameters.

AB We describe the relationships between vegetation patterns, depth of sediment accumulation, and distance to shore in Arcadia Bog, a small moat bog in Belchertown, Massachusetts. A Fringe Moat community occurs Primarily where sediment depths are 0-2 m and at 0-10 m from shore. Shrub Thickets are least restricted in their distribution, occurring at 0-30 m from shore above 0-10 m of sediment. The true bog community (Dwarf Tree/Shrub) is divided into two types-Tamarack/Spruce centered at 15-25 m from shore above 7-11 m of sediment and Spruce/Tamarack at the deeper, more distant central portion of the basin (20-40 m from shore, 10-13 m depth). This community is uncommon in central Massachusetts. Variations in surface-water pH suggest that the distributions of at least some species may be influenced by nutrient availability. Additional studies would be required to determine the relationship between physiographic location and water chemistry and flow, the ecological factors most likely controlling vegetation patterns in Arcadia Bog.

Mass movements of peat, reported usually as peat slides and bog bursts, have been well documented for over 150 years. However, the fundamental controls of this form of shallow instability are still poorly understood. The aim of this paper is to review critically the available evidence linking peat hydrology and slope instability. Then, using data from the North Pennine uplands in Northern England, we examine the importance of rainfall, macroscale drainage conditions and peat hydrological processes in initiating slope instability. Shear failure by loading, buoyancy effects, basal liquefaction and surface or marginal rupturing have all been proposed as potential failure mechanisms. Data from Northern England demonstrate that hydrological processes are fundamental in determining the spatial and temporal occurrence of peat slides. Most instabilities are associated with convective summer thunderstorms, although instances of rapid snowmelt and intense winter rainfall have also triggered these events. All instabilities occur in association with distinct drainage features. Slides are initiated along natural drainage lines or in association with artificial drainage often brought about by mining activity or agricultural practices. At the scale of the soil profile the special hydrological properties of peat, in particular shallow water tables and low soil hydraulic conductivity, offer important clues to failure mechanisms. Pore water pressures are generally low and vary little in the peat profile and throughout the year. It is clear from observations of subsurface flow that significant volumes of runoff reach considerable depths in the soil. Macropores (flow occurring in pores greater than 1 mm in diameter) are important in delivering surface runoff to deeper parts of the profile and in some instances high pipe water pressures may develop. These findings define several important hydrological controls for surficial mass movements in peat but the prospect of predicting the location and timing of such events is still a long way off.

AB Carbon dynamics in peatlands are controlled, in large part, by their wetness as defined by water table depth and volumetric liquid soil moisture content. A common type of peatland is raised bogs that typically have a multiple-layer canopy of vascular plants over a Sphagnum moss ground cover. Their convex form restricts water supply to precipitation and water is shed toward the margins, usually by lateral subsurface flow. The hydraulic gradient for lateral subsurface flow is governed by the peat surface topography at the mesoscale (similar to 200 m to 5 km). To investigate the influence of mesoscale topography on wetness, evapotranspiration (ET), and gross primary productivity (GPP) in a bog during the snow-free period, we compare the outputs of a further developed version of the daily Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) with observations made at the Mer Bleue peatland, located near Ottawa, Canada. Explicitly considering mesoscale topography, simulated total ET and GPP correlate well with measured ET (r = 0.91) and derived gross ecosystem productivity (GEP; r = 0.92). Both measured ET and derived GEP are simulated similarly well when mesoscale topography is neglected, but daily simulated values are systematically underestimated by about 10% and 12% on average, respectively, due to greater wetness resulting from the lack of lateral subsurface flow. Owing to the differences in moss surface conductances of water vapor and carbon dioxide with increasing moss water content, the differences in the spatial patterns of simulated total ET and GPP are controlled by the mesotopographic position of the moss ground cover.

AB Testate amoebae-based. transfer functions are commonly used in peatland palaeoclimate studies. These models have been developed in several regions of the world and are sometimes used for palaeohydrological reconstruction from fossil data in locations where no transfer functions exist. Limitations of this approach may include missing modern analogues and problems associated with site-specific or regional factors in testate amoebae ecology and biogeography. This study presents new testate amoebae-hydrology transfer functions based on data from six peatlands in Northern England. Transfer functions were generated for water table depth and moisture content using weighted averaging tolerance downweighted regression with inverse deshrinking and model performance was assessed using leave-one-out (jacknifing) cross-validation. To examine the robustness of applying transfer functions extra-regionally, we performed a number of spatially independent cross-validation (SICV) tests using contemporary testate amoebae and environmental data from established Northern Ireland and ACCROTELM transfer functions. Inferred water table depths were consistent with observed values in terms of position along the hydrological gradient, however magnitudes varied. We then applied the three independent transfer functions to fossil data from a peatland in Northern England to compare the reconstructions. The results show that the direction of the reconstructions is consistent in terms of wet/dry shifts. However, variation in the magnitudes of the reconstructed water tables is apparent. This probably reflects the sampling regime, including temporal/seasonal effects, and differences in testate amoebae ecology between regions and individual sites. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB The hydraulic conductivity (K) of peat beneath the water table varies over short (annual) periods. Biogenic gas bubbles block pores and reduce K, and seasonal changes in the water table position cause peat deformation, altering peat pore size distribution. Although it has been hypothesized that both processes reduce K during warm dry summer conditions, temporal variations in K under field conditions have been explained previously by peat volume changes (strain) alone. We determine the effect of both controls on K by monitoring changes in gas content (), strain and K within a poor fen. Over the growing season, K decreased by an order of magnitude. In the near-surface peat (0.3-0.7m), this reduction is more strongly correlated with , providing the first field-based evidence that biogenic gas bubbles reduce K. In the deeper peat (0.7-1.3m), K is correlated principally with strain. However, causality is uncertain because of multicollinearity between strain and . To mitigate for multicollinearity, we took advantage of a peatland drainage experiment where the water table was artificially dropped at the beginning of the growing season, reducing correlations between strain and . remained the primary cause of K variations just beneath the water table at a depth of 0.5-0.7m, although further down through the peat profile (0.7-1.2m) changes in K were controlled by strain. We suggest that the larger pore structure of the poorly decomposed peat just below the water table is impacted less by volume changes than that of the more decomposed peat at depth. However, within this poorly decomposed peat, K is reduced by the high gas contents that result from higher rates of methane production. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This study considers the relative performance of six different models to predict soil respiration from upland peat. Predicting soil respiration is important for global carbon budgets and gap filling measured data from eddy covariance and closed chamber measurements. Further to models previously published new models are presented using two sub-soil zones and season. Models are tested using data from the Bleaklow plateau, southern Pennines, UK. Presented literature models include ANOVA using logged environmental data, the Arrhenius equation, modified versions of the Arrhenius equation to include soil respiration activation energy and water table depth. New models are proposed including the introduction of two soil zones in the peat profile, and season. The first new model proposes a zone of high CO2 productivity related to increased soil microbial CO2 production due to the supply of labile carbon from plant root exudates and root respiration. The second zone is a deeper zone where CO2 production is lower with less labile carbon. A final model allows the zone of high CO2 production to become dormant during winter months when plants will senesce and will vary depending upon vegetation type within a fixed location. The final model accounted for, on average, 31.9% of variance in net ecosystem respiration within 11 different restoration sites whilst, using the same data set, the best fitting literature equation only accounted for 18.7% of the total variance. Our results demonstrate that soil respiration models can be improved by explicitly accounting for seasonality and the vertically stratified nature of soil processes. These improved models provide an enhanced basis for calculating the peatland carbon budgets which are essential in understanding the role of peatlands in the global C cycle. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions from managed peatlands are annually reported to the UNFCCC For the estimation of greenhouse gas (GHG) balances on a country-wide basis, It is necessary to know how soil-atmosphere fluxes are associated with variables that are available for spatial upscaling We measured momentary soil-atmosphere CO2 (heterotrophic and total soil respiration), CH4 and N2O fluxes at 68 forestry-drained peatland sites in Finland over two growing seasons We estimated annual CO2 effluxes for the sites using site-specific temperature regressions and simulations in half-hourly time steps Annual CH4 and N2O fluxes were interpolated from the measurements We then tested how well climate and site variables derived from forest inventory results and weather statistics could be used to explain between-site variation in the annual fluxes The estimated annual CO2 effluxes ranged from 1165 to 4437 g m(-2) year(-1) (total soil respiration) and from 534 to 2455 g m(-2) year(-1) (heterotrophic soil respiration) Means of 95% confidence intervals were +/- 12% of total and +/- 22% of heterotrophic soil respiration Estimated annual CO2 efflux was strongly correlated with soil respiration at the reference temperature (10 degrees C) and with summer mean air temperature. Temperature sensitivity had little effect on the estimated annual fluxes Models with tree stand stem volume, site type and summer mean air temperature as independent variables explained 56% of total and 57% of heterotrophic annual CO2 effluxes. Adding summer mean water table depth to the models raised the explanatory power to 66% and 64% respectively Most of the sites were small CH4 sinks and N2O sources The interpolated annual CH4 flux (range -0 97 to 12 50 g m(-2) year(-1)) was best explained by summer mean water table depth (r(2) = 64%) and rather weakly by tree stand stern volume (r(2) = 22%) and mire vegetation cover (r(2) = 15%) N2O flux (range. -0 03 to 092 g m(-2) year(-1)) was best explained by peat CN ratio (r(2) = 35%). Site type explained 13% of annual N2O flux We suggest that water table depth should be measured in national land-use inventories for improving the estimation of country-level GHG fluxes for peatlands (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID PRECISION BIDECADAL CALIBRATION; RADIOCARBON TIME SCALE; SOILS; BC
AB There is considerable speculation about relationships between soil development and local-scale blanket bog formation in southeastern Newfoundland. This study examined podzolization along a catena in southeastern Newfoundland. The specific objective was to investigate pedogenic processes, in particular placic and ortstein horizon development, as well as potential links between soil and peatland formation. Chemical, hydrological, and physical processes potentially responsible for pedogenesis were examined. Placic genesis appears to be linked to the precipitation of Fe at oxidizing and higher soil pH contacts at depth in the soil, Placic formation in the well-drained heathlands is apparently precluded by constraints on Fe mobilization at the surface, in particular, Fe-oxidizing conditions and the presence of sufficient supplies of metals neutralizing mobile organic substances. Organic-complexed Al is the dominant cementing agent in ortstein horizons. Cementation is augmented by minimal bioturbation by roots and high coarse-fragment content, which concentrates Fe and Al to a limited soil matrix. Weathering, podzolization, elevated water tables, and peatland processes are promoted by groundwater discharge from adjacent bogs as well as by sesquioxide pans that impede vertical drainage.

AB Peatlands are an important component of the Holocene global carbon (C) cycle and the rate of C sequestration and storage is driven by the balance between net primary productivity and decay. A number of studies now suggest that climate is a key driver of peatland C accumulation at large spatial scales and over long timescales, with warmer conditions associated with higher rates of C accumulation. However, other factors are also likely to play a significant role in determining local carbon accumulation rates and these may modify past, present and future peatland carbon sequestration. Here, we test the importance of climate as a driver of C accumulation, compared with hydrological change, fire, nitrogen content and vegetation type, from records of C accumulation at three sites in northeastern North America, across the N-S climate gradient of raised bog distribution. Radiocarbon age models, bulk density values and %C measurements from each site are used to construct C accumulation histories commencing between 11,200 and 8000 cal. years BP. The relationship between C accumulation and environmental variables (past water table depth, fire, peat forming vegetation and nitrogen content) is assessed with linear and multivariate regression analyses. Differences in long-term rates of carbon accumulation between sites support the contention that a warmer climate with longer growing seasons results in faster rates of long-term carbon accumulation. However, mid-late Holocene accumulation rates show divergent trends, decreasing in the north but rising in the south. We hypothesise that sites close to the moisture threshold for raised bog distribution increased their growth rate in response to a cooler climate with lower evapotranspiration in the late Holocene, but net primary productivity declined over the same period in northern areas causing a decrease in C accumulation. There was no clear relationship between C accumulation and hydrological change, vegetation, nitrogen content or fire, but early successional stages of peatland growth had faster rates of C accumulation even though temperatures were probably lower at the time. We conclude that climate is the most important driver of peatland accumulation rates over millennial timescales, but that successional vegetation change is a significant additional influence. Whilst the majority of northern peatlands are likely to increase C accumulation rates under future warmer climates, those at the southern limit of distribution may show reduced rates. However, early succession peatlands that develop under future warming at the northern limits of peatland distribution are likely to have high rates of C accumulation and will compensate for some of the losses elsewhere.

AB Peatland-inhabiting testate amoebae are sensitive indicators of substrate-moisture conditions and have increasingly been used in palaeohydrological studies. However, to improve accuracy of testate-amoeba-based hydrological inferences, baseline ecological data on rare taxa, a larger geographic network of calibration sites, and incorporation of long-term estimates of water-table depth are needed. Species-environment relationships at 369 sites from 31 peatlands in eastern North America were investigated. Long-term estimates of water-table depth were obtained using the method of polyvinyl (PVC) tape-discolouration. Transfer functions were developed using a variety of models, and validated through jackknifing techniques and with an independent dataset where water-table depths were directly measured throughout the growing season. Results indicate that mean annual water-table depth can be inferred from testate amoeba assemblages with a mean error of 6 to 8 cm, although there is a slight systematic bias. All transfer function models performed similarly and produced similar reconstructions on a fossil sequence. In a preliminary effort towards development of a comprehensive North American calibration dataset, data from this study were combined with previous studies in Michigan and the Rocky Mountains (n = 650). This combined dataset had slightly larger mean errors of prediction (8-9 cm) but includes data for several rare taxa. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; HYDROCHEMISTRY; PORTUGAL; URANIUM
AB The relations between groundwater composition, land use, soil conditions and flow patterns on a regional scale are studied for the Gooi and Vechtstreek area in the Netherlands. This densely populated area consists of a glacier-created ridge with dry sand soils bordered by the Vecht and Eem River plains with wet Peat and clay soils. R-mode factor analysis and Q-mode cluster analysis were applied to a set of 1349 groundwater analyses to determine the factors controlling groundwater composition and the main resulting water types.
   The results indicate that groundwater composition in the study area is affected on a regional scale by human activities through changes in land use and intervention in natural flow patterns. On the ridge, ground water is recharged by precipitation, which dissolves carbonates from the matrix of the sandy aquifer. Increased solute concentrations in shallow ground water, especially of nitrate, sulphate and potassium, indicate increased pollution resulting from urbanization and increasingly intensive agricultural activity over the past decades.
   In the Vecht River plain infiltration occurs as a result of drainage of polders and groundwater "traction on the ridge. Recharge occurs by precipitation and from polluted surface water to which ammonium, organic complexes and carbonic acid are added through decomposition of organic matter in the peat and clay soils. The carbonic acid results in enhanced dissolution of carbonates present in the soil and the underlying sandy aquifer. Oxygen depletion and subsequent low redox potentials result in denitrification, dissolution of manganese and iron oxides, and sulphate reduction. The flow of ground water from high-level to low-level polders causes displacement of a former stagnant brackish groundwater body under the Vecht River plain accompanied by increased mixing of fresh and brackish ground water.

AB We document accelerating invasion of woody vegetation into wetlands on the western Kenai Peninsula lowlands. Historical aerial photography for 11 wetland sites showed that herbaceous area shrank 6.2%/decade from 1951 to 1968, and 11.1%/decade from 1968 to 1996. Corresponding rates for converting herbaceous area to shrubland were 11.5% and 13.7%/decade, respectively, and, for converting nonforest to forest, were 7.8% and 8.3%/decade, respectively. Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) forests on three wetland perimeters established since the Little Ice Age concluded in the 1850s. Dwarf birch shrubs at three wetland sites showed median apparent tree-ring age of 13 years, indicating recent shrub colonization at these sites. Peat cores at 24 wetland sites (basal peat ages 1840-18 740 calibrated years before present) indicated that these peatlands originated as wet Sphagnum-sedge fens with very little woody vegetation. Local meteorological records show a 55% decline in available water since 1968, of which one-third is due to higher summer temperatures and increased evapotranspiration and two-thirds is due to lower annual precipitation. These results suggest that wet Sphagnum-sedge fens initiating since the end of the Wisconsin glaciation began to dry in the 1850s and that this drying has greatly accelerated since the 1970s.

AB In this study, we evaluated flow structure, effective flow area (A(eff)) and effective porosity (theta(eff)) in three peatlands using the stable isotope O-18/O-16 ratio and tracer tests. We also applied the readily available groundwater modelling MODFLOW code for wetland flow modelling and simulated in one study site how the hydraulic performance of the wetland will be improved by changing the design of the distribution ditch. Preferential flow paths occurred in all three studied wetlands and A(eff) varied from 40% to 90% of total wetland area while theta(eff) was 0.75-0.99. Constructed flow models accurately simulated the hydraulic head across wetlands (r(2)=0.95-0.99). Similarities between the flow models and the stable isotope distributions observed in this study suggest possibilities in using MODFLOW to design peatlands. The improvement of the inlet ditch configuration (ditch length/wetland width > 0.45) can prevent or reduce short-circuiting and dead zones in peatlands treating wastewater. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In arctic streams, depth of thaw beneath the stream channel is likely a significant parameter controlling hyporheic zone hydrology and biogeochemical cycling. As part of an interdisciplinary study of this system, we conducted a field investigation to test the effectiveness of imaging substream permafrost using ground-penetrating radar (GPR). We investigated three sites characterized by low-energy water flow, organic material lining the streambeds, and water depths ranging from 0-2 to 2 m. We acquired data using a 200 MHz pulsed radar system with the antennas mounted in the bottom of a small rubber boat that was pulled across the stream while triggering the radar at a constant rate. We achieved excellent results at all three sites, with a clear continuous image of the permafrost boundary both peripheral to and beneath the stream. Our results demonstrate that GPR can be an effective tool for measuring substream thaw depth. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We investigated the constraints on sulfide uptake by bacterial ectosymbionts on the marine peritrich ciliate Zoothamnium niveum by a combination of experimental and numerical methods. Protists with symbionts were collected on large blocks of mangrove-peat. The blocks were placed in a flow cell with flow adjusted to in situ velocity. The water motion around the colonies was then characterized by particle tracking velocimetry. This shows that the feather-shaped colony of Z. niveum generates a unidirectional flow of seawater through the colony with no recirculation. The source of the feeding current was the free-flowing water although the size of the colonies suggests that they live partly submerged in the diffusive boundary layer. We showed that the filtered volume allows Z. niveum to assimilate sufficient sulfide to sustain the symbiosis at a few micromoles per liter in ambient concentration. Numerical modeling shows that sulfide oxidizing bacteria on the surfaces of Z. niveum can sustain 100-times higher sulfide uptake than bacteria on flat surfaces, such as microbial mats. The study demonstrates that the filter feeding zooids of Z. niveum are preadapted to be prime habitats for sulfide oxidizing bacteria due to Z. niveum's habitat preference and due to the feeding current. Z. niveum is capable of exploiting low concentrations of sulfide in near norm-oxic seawater. This links its otherwise dissimilar habitats and makes it functionally similar to invertebrates with thiotrophic symbionts in filtering organs.

AB Testate amoebae analysis is used to provide the first quantitative reconstruction of Holocene surface wetness changes from a Southern Hemisphere ombrogenous bog. Water-table depth and surface moisture are the dominant environmental factors influencing testate amoebae species composition in a modem training set of 62 surface samples from 19 bogs in New Zealand. A transfer function based on partial least squares (PLS) performed well in cross-validation of modem samples, but produced unrealistic predictions of water-table depth and moisture for fossil samples. This resulted from poor overlap of species composition between modem and fossil samples. Peat humification data is used to examine decay-related species diversity trends and ordination is used to explore the differences between modem and fossil assemblages. Poor overlap can be explained by differential preservation in the fossil assemblages of those taxa with more robust tests. This enhances their abundance and reduces the overall diversity of the fossil assemblages. Human activities over the last 150 years have also influenced the surface environments and hydrology of the sampled bogs. In this situation, weighted average (WA) and tolerance downweighted weighted average (WA-Tol) models were more robust than PLS, and were applied, along with semi-quantitative scoring, to reconstruct more realistic Holocene surface wetness changes. Selection of the best model for reconstruction of surface wetness changes should be based on the characteristics of the fossil data rather than the predictive power of the model in cross-validation of the modem data alone.

Raised up to 2 m above the surrounding landscape and underlain by permafrost, these forested peatlands provide meltwater drainage to the surrounding wetlands, and to basin runoff. Understanding the factors that control the volume and timing of runoff from peat plateaus is the essential first step towards developing methods of accurately predicting basin runoff from wetland-dominated basins in the region of discontinuous permafrost, as well as understanding the basin response to hydrological changes brought on by the thermal degradation and thaw of permafrost peatlands. In this study, a water balance approach and the Dupuit-Forchheimer equation were used to quantify sub-surface runoff from a forested peat plateau at Scotty Creek, a small (152 km(2)), wetlanddominated discontinuous permafrost basin in Northwest Territories, Canada. These two computations yielded similar results in both years of study (2004-2005), and showed that runoff accounted for approximately half of the moisture loss from the peat plateau, most of which occurred in response to snowmelt inputs. The melt of ground ice was also a significant source of water during the study periods, which was largely detained in soil storage. Soil moisture conditions prior to soil freezing were a major factor controlling the volume of runoff from the hillslope. Sub-surface drainage rates declined dramatically after the snowmelt runoff period, when the majority of water inputs went to soil storage and evapotranspiration. The minimal lag between rain events and hydrograph response in both years suggests that much of the runoff produced from rain events is rapidly transported to the adjacent wetlands. These results give insight into how current climate warming predictions for northern latitudes could affect the hydrological response of forested peat plateaus, and the basins which they occupy.

AB Large-scale changes in climate may have unexpected effects on ecosystems, given the importance of climate as a control over almost all ecosystem attributes and internal feedbacks. Changes in plant community productivity or composition, for example, may alter ecosystem resource dynamics, trophic structures, or disturbance regimes, with subsequent positive or negative feedbacks on the plant community. At northern latitudes, where increases in temperature are expected to be greatest but where plant species diversity is relatively low, climatically mediated changes in species composition or abundance will likely have large ecosystem effects. In this study, we investigated effects of infrared loading and manipulations of water-table elevation on net primary productivity of plant species in bog and fen wetland mesocosms between 1994 and 1997.
   We removed 27 intact soil monoliths (2.1 m(2) surface area, 0.5-0.7 m depth) each from a bog and a fen in northern Minnesota to construct a large mesocosm facility that allows for direct manipulation of climatic variables in a replicated experimental design. The treatment design was a fully crossed factorial with three infrared-loading treatments, three water-table treatments, and two ecosystem types (bogs and fens), with three replicates of all treatment combinations. Overhead infrared lamps caused mean monthly soil temperatures to increase by 1.6-4.1 degreesC at 15-cm depth during the growing season (May-October). In 1996, depths to water table averaged -11, -19, and -26 cm in the bog plots, and 0, -10, and -19 cm in the fen plots.
   Annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of bryophyte, forb, graminoid, and shrub life-forms was determined for the dominant species in the mesocosm plots based on species specific canopy/biomass relationships. Belowground net primary production (BNPP) was estimated using root in-growth cores.
   Bog and fen communities differed in their response to infrared loading and water-table treatments because of the differential response of life-forms and species characteristic of each community. Along a gradient of increasing water-table elevation, production of bryophytes increased, and production of shrubs decreased in the bog community. Along a similar gradient in the fen community, production of graminoids and forbs increased. Along a gradient of in creasing infrared loading in the bog, shrub production increased whereas graminoid production decreased. In the fen, graminoids were most productive at high infrared loading, and forbs were most productive at medium infrared loading. In the bog and fen, BNPP:ANPP ratios increased with warming and drying, indicating shifts in carbon allocation in response to climate change.
   Further, opposing responses of species and life-forms tended to cancel out the response of production at higher levels of organization, especially in the bog. For example, total net primary productivity in the bog did not differ between water-table treatments because BNPP was greatest in the dry treatment whereas ANPP was greatest in the wet treatment.
   The differential responses of species, life-forms, and above- and belowground biomass production to the treatments suggest that bog and fen plant communities will change, in different directions and magnitudes, in response to warming and changes in water-table elevation. Further, results of this and complementary research indicate that these peatlands may mediate their energy, carbon, and nutrient budgets through differential responses of the plant communities. Thus, predictions of the response of peatlands to changes in climate should consider differences in plant community structure, as well as biogeochemistry and hydrology, that characterize and differentiate these two ecosystems.

AB Wetland buffer zones (WBZs) are riparian areas that form a transition between terrestrial and aquatic environments and are well-known to remove agricultural water pollutants such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). This review attempts to merge and compare data on the nutrient load, nutrient loss and nutrient removal and/or retention from multiple studies of various WBZs termed as riparian mineral soil wetlands, groundwatercharged peatlands (i.e. fens) and floodplains. Two different soil types ('organic' and 'mineral'), four different main water sources ('groundwater', 'precipitation', 'surface runoff/drain discharge', and 'river inundation') and three different vegetation classes ('arboraceous', 'herbaceous' and 'aerenchymous') were considered separately for data analysis. The studied WBZs are situated within the temperate and continental climatic regions that are commonly found in northern-central Europe, northern USA and Canada. Surprisingly, only weak differences for the nutrient removal/retention capability were found if the three WBZ types were directly compared. The results of our study reveal that for example the nitrate retention efficiency of organic soils (53 +/- 28%; mean +/- sd) is only slightly higher than that of mineral soils (50 +/- 32%). Variance in load had a stronger influence than soil type on the N retention inWBZs. However, organic soils in fens tend to be sources of dissolved organic N and soluble reactive P, particularly when the fens have become degraded due to drainage and past agricultural usage. The detailed consideration of water sources indicated that average nitrate removal efficiencies were highest for ground water (76 +/- 25%) and lowest for river water (35 +/- 24%). No significant pattern for P retention emerged; however, the highest absolute removal appeared if the P source was river water. The harvesting of vegetation will minimise potential P loss from rewetted WBZs and plant biomass yield may promote circular economy value chains and provide compensation to land owners for restored land now unsuitable for conventional farming.

AB The rewetting technique border irrigation was installed in a degraded fen peatland in northeastern Germany. Because of the prevailing site conditions, the technique resulted in two different rewetting variants (surface irrigation and temporary inundation) at the study site. This paper reports on the practicability of this technique and the influence of rewetting on vegetation development, decomposition processes and soil nutrient availability, and the possibilities for renewed peat accumulation. The technique proved to be suited for rewetting fen sites with a continuous slope, deep peat layer with low hydraulic conductivity, and upstream water recharge facilities. A subsidence of the ground-water levels during the summer months, however, could not be avoided in dry years. The vegetation changed slowly from species-poor grassland into typical fen plant communities, despite rewetting and soil tillage. Species richness, however, was higher in the surface irrigation than in the temporary inundation variant. A sufficient water supply proved to be absolutely necessary to retard decomposition processes because higher decomposition of root materials (i.e., higher k values) occurred under temporary inundated conditions. Generally, the higher water content in the soil after rewetting led to a lower nitrate-N-to-ammonium-N ratio in the topsoil in both rewetting variants. In the surface irrigation variant the mineral nitrogen content (Nmin) of the topsoil decreased from 7.8 to 4.4 g N/m(2), which is also correlated with the increase in water content of the soil. The low Nmin levels of fens which were never deeply drained (0.9-2.8 g N/m(2)), however, were not reached within the observation period of 3 years.

AB Ombrotrophic bogs are used to reliably assess past and present levels of heavy metal depositions through chemical analyses of peat layers. Instead, surface waters collected in ombrotrophic bogs were never tested as an alternative way to assess atmospheric precipitation quality, although the solely source of water in bogs is by atmospheric precipitation. In the present paper the reliability of bog water to mirror atmospheric precipitation quality has been tested. To this aim, heavy metal concentrations in bog water were compared to both rainwater chemistry, and tissue chemistry of Hylocomium splendens, a moss frequently used as biomonitor. Bog water was periodically sampled in three different microhabitats, i.e., a hummock, a carpet, and a hollow at two bogs, located in the south-eastern Alps of Italy. Microhabitats were selected in order to encompass a gradient of water table depth from relatively dry to relatively wet conditions, respectively. Basing on surface peat and bog water chemistry as well as on hydrological measurements, selected microhabitats were shown to be ombrotrophic, i.e., their mineral input was solely by atmospheric precipitation. Heavy metal concentrations in bog water did not differ significantly among microhabitats, with the only exception of Fe which showed significantly higher concentrations in hummock water. Because of the lack of rainwater chemical information for the study area, mean heavy metal concentrations in rainwater were obtained from a set of European stations monitoring atmospheric precipitation. A significant relationship was found between heavy metals in rainwater and bog water, further supported by the positive relationship between emission amounts of Cd, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Pb in Italy and the corresponding values in bog water during the study period. Concentrations of heavy metals in bog water were then compared with corresponding concentrations in H. splendens collected in the nearby of the study bogs. Moss chemistry has been here used as a proxy of atmospheric precipitation chemistry, basing on the reliability of mosses to mirror local precipitation chemistry as widely demonstrated by biomonitoring surveys. Bog water and moss tissues showed the same pattern of variation of concentrations, although moss tissues were characterised by higher absolute concentrations of heavy metals. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB In order to study the accumulation mechanism of "barkinite", eight Late Permian channel benches (approximately 15-cm across and 10-cm deep) were taken from the Jinshan Mine, Anhui Province, China. The samples were analyzed by microscopical and geochemical methods. The microscopical observations indicate that the occurrence modes of "barkinite" in this area are different from those in other areas of China. The ratios of structureless "barkinite" are much higher in the Jinshan Mine, probably due to the flow-water and marine influenced environments. Furthermore, vitrinite macerals also show a strong fluorescence. The vitrinite fluorescence characteristics have not been observed in the Permian "barkinite" coals from northern China. The composition and variation of minerals in the column section also showed that the swamps in the study area were seriously influenced by seawater in the early and late stage during the peat accumulation.

AB The influence of agriculture and settlement on the mire valley landscape and as well as the role of tree-covered belts in halting of pollution from arable land were examined.
   The natural mire valley landscape is slightly influenced by human activity, which consists in supplying the valley margins in N, P and K from arable land. The groundwater supplies the valley margins in Ca and HCO3-, whereas the river water brings N, P, K in area of river flooding and Mg, Cl- and Fe in the river margins zone.
   In the drained valley the human impact on landscape appears in changes of habitats, soils and vegetation which is related mainly to new water conditions caused by new river-bed. However human activity has an impact on the hydrogeochemical processes. The peatland is enriched with anthropogenic pollutants: K, Mg, Cl- and HCO3-. The valley margins are supplied with N, P and Fe leaching from arable land. Moreover, N, P and Fe are released in the mucking, process. The tree-covered belts situated on the valley margins play a significant role in stopping pollution.

Xylem was more efficient at conducting water and stomata were more sensitive to atmospheric evaporative demand in trees subjected to favorable growth conditions (control trees) than in trees growing in shade or waterlogged conditions. At the same soil water availability, shade-grown trees suffered more severely from water deficit than control trees. Under conditions of high atmospheric vapor pressure deficit, foliage of shade-grown trees exhibited low water potentials, as a result of low hydraulic conductance of the vascular system and inefficient stomatal control. Because of the increased internal resistance to water flow, more negative leaf water potentials (Psi (x)) must be reached to provide an adequate water supply to the foliage. It is concluded that dynamic water stress is one of the main causes of the continuing growth retardation in suppressed Norway spruce trees after their release from the overstory.
   Trees growing in waterlogged soil (bog-grown trees) were characterized by weak stomatal control, resulting in large water losses from the foliage. Although bog-grown trees exhibited uneconomical water use, they possessed mechanisms (e.g., osmotic adjustment) that allowed leaves to tolerate low Psi (x) while stomata remained open. Under conditions of sufficient soil water availability and moderate atmospheric vapor pressure deficit, soil-to-leaf conductance was highest in bog-grown trees (1.45 +/- 0.06 mmol m(-2) s(-1) MPa-1), followed by control and shade-grown trees (1.04 +/- 0.04 and 0.77 +/- 0.05 mmol m(-2) s(-1) MPa-1, respectively). The lowest soil-to-leaf conductance (0.45 +/- 0.04 mmol m(-2) s(-1) MPa-1) was recorded in control trees at high atmospheric evaporative demand, and was probably caused by tracheid cavitation.

AB In the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, fluxes of water, energy, and carbon determine the water and carbon balance of peat bogs. We used eddy covariance (EC) measurements to study surface atmosphere exchange and its drivers above an ombrotrophic peat bog (Odersprungmoor) in the Harz Mountains, Germany, with nonideal measurement conditions during the growing season in 2013. For montane peatlands, only very few EC flux measurements exist due to site constraints, for example, surface slope, limited fetch, and frequent dew formation on open path sensors. The measured data were carefully filtered resulting in valid and representative fluxes for the bog. The evapotranspiration (ET) was further characterized by determining the adjusted crop coefficient (K-c*) for July and August and comparing it with K-c* values from 7 years of the FLUXNET site Mer Bleue bog, Ontario, Canada. While soil moisture was taken into consideration, the adjustment was nevertheless necessary as plant health and nutrient supply were not evaluated as required by FAO guidelines. Actual ET at OM was well described by the K-c* model (K-c* = 0.85, R-2 = 0.85). The primary control on ET was available energy and atmospheric conditions and, marginally, the soil moisture conditions. This K-c* value is comparable to the calculated K-c* values for MB, which ranged between 0.82 and 0.86 (R-2 between 0.84 and 0.97). Since these K-c* ranges are narrow for the different sites and years, we hypothesize that these values are good estimates for the true crop coefficients of Sphagnum-dominated peat bogs.

AB Peatlands provide a widespread terrestrial archive for Holocene study. However, little is known about the grain-size characteristics of peaty sediments and their environmental significance. In order to study these phenomena in detail, two sections from the Hani and Gushantun peatlands in the Changbai Mountain Area were cored and sub-sampled. Based on reliable calibrated AMS C-14 ages, we established grain size variations in the peat cores since 15.6 ka cal. BP. Our results showed that the peaty sediments in the Changbai Mountains are mainly composed of silt. Moreover, the grain size component, which is related to paleoclimate variables, can be classified into three groups based on the "Grain size class vs. standard deviation" method. These sensitive grain size components are < 37.0 mm (Component 1 or C1), 37.0e497.8 mm (Component 2 or C2) and > 497.8 mm (Component 3 or C3). C1 comprises the finest silt in the peaty sediment and is mainly conveyed by the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM), whereas C2 is transported into the peatland by surface runoff related to the enhancement of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). C3 is conveyed in saltation and bed-load mode by strong surface runoff linked to high-energy flow caused by a strong EASM, and perhaps is an indicator of extreme rainfall events in the Changbai Mountains. Our results suggest that the study region was dominated by a cold/dry environment during the late-glacial period under a strong EAWM. However, there was a marked climatic shift from an EAWM-dominated cold/dry climate to an EASM-dominated more mesic environment during the early Holocene. Increased percentage of C2 in peat cores during the Holocene Optimum (9.0-4.5 ka) indicates abundant rainfall in the study region (even with extreme rainfall events) as a result of a significant enhancement of the EASM. Weak monsoon events occurred at 10.5 ka, 9.2 ka, 8.2 ka, 7.2 ka, 6.2ka, 5.5 ka and 4.2 ka shown by sharp decreases in C2, agreeing with the stalagmite delta O-18 records in China. The results obtained from environmentally sensitive grain-size component records are largely consistent with other palaeoenvironmental records in the East Asian monsoon area, substantiating the regional climate patterns and monsoon evolution since late-glacial time. Because intensity of the East Asian monsoon is likely responsible for the grain-size change in the peat samples, the grain size components in peat samples may be used for reconstructions of past environmental conditions and of variability in the East Asian monsoon.

AB The composition of the vegetation of fishpond mires in the Trebon Basin (Czech Republic) was studied in relation to temporal fluctuations in certain environmental factors. The water-table depth, water pH and electrical conductivity at 49 permanent plots were measured at approximately three-week intervals from March to October 2003. Minimum, maximum, mean, median and variation in the above-mentioned environmental factors were correlated with vegetation composition. The most important environmental factors explaining the variation in vegetation were mean pH and maximum water-table level. Median conductivity increased with increase in waterlogging and eutrophication. Some seasonal trends in the dynamics of these parameters were observed. The lowest conductivity was in spring, increased continuously throughout summer and peaked in autumn. In contrast, water level decreased in summer, when evapotranspiration was greatest, and rose in autumn after heavy rainfall. The pH increased from March to June, then was stable and decreased at the end of summer. Seasonal trends were generally identical in all vegetation types. The fluctuations in the environmental factors were so considerable that they may influence the reliability of vegetation environmental analyses.

AB The distribution of fresh and salt water in coastal aquifers is influenced by many processes. The influence of aquifer heterogeneity and human interference such as land reclamation is illustrated in the Belgian coastal plain where, around A.D. 1200, the reclamation of a tidally influenced environment was completed. The aquifer, which was filled with salt water, was thereafter freshened. The areal distribution of peat, clay, silt and sand influences the general flow and distribution of fresh and salt water along with the drainage pattern and results in the development of fresh-water lenses. The water quality in and around the fresh-water lenses below an inverted tidal channel ridge is surveyed. The hydrochemical evolution of the fresh water lens is reconstructed, pointing to cation exchange, solution of calcite and the oxidation of organic material as the major chemical reactions. The formation and evolution of the fresh water lens is modelled using a two-dimensional density-dependent solute transport model and the sensitivity of drainage and conductivities are studied. Drainage level mainly influences the depth of the fresh-water lens, whereas the time of formation is mainly influenced by conductivity.

AB Depth to water table is a simple, commonly used measure of hydrological function in raised bogs. The maximum depth of the water table or the average annual water table is often monitored over the long term to track the hydrological trajectory of the ecosystem. These measures, however, may not take into account the duration of the moisture deficit period. The annual water table moisture deficit (WTMD) at 67 sites in a single disturbed raised bog was calculated using the amount of time that the water table was at each depth below the surface during the moisture deficit season. The calculated value estimates a linearly developing deficit that dewaters the acrotelm during the moisture deficit season. At each site, plant species composition was assigned to one of eight plant community types. The approximate threshold above which bog plant communities will begin transitioning into drier types with taller shrubs and trees was a WTMD of 62 m-days. An annual climatic moisture deficit (CMD) was calculated using daily air temperature, spatially interpolated precipitation and estimated potential evapotranspiration for each site. Mixed-effects modelling of WTMD as a function CMD indicated a positive linear relation for most vegetation types, which was affected by the presence of drainage ditches, ditch blocking, fire and evapotranspiration by shrubs and trees. Tracking the WTMD and its relation to CMD may be useful for assessing ecosystem health and serve as a basis for estimating moisture deficit thresholds for bogs of conservation concern.

AB The companion paper (Guan et al., 2010) demonstrated variable interactions and correlations between shallow soil moisture and ground thaw in soil filled areas along a wetness spectrum in a subarctic Canadian Precambrian Shield landscape. From wetter to drier, these included a wetland, peatland and soil filled valley. Herein, water and energy fluxes were examined for these same subarctic study sites to discern the key controlling processes on the found patterns. Results showed the presence of surface water was the key control in variable soil moisture and frost table interactions among sites. At the peatland and wetland sites, accumulated water in depressions and flow paths maintained soil moisture for a longer duration than at the hummock tops. These wet areas were often locations of deepest thaw depth due to the transfer of latent heat accompanying lateral surface runoff. Although the peatland and wetland sites had large inundation extent, modified P,clet numbers indicated the relative influence of external and internal hydrological and energy processes at each site were different. Continuous inflow from an upstream lake into the wetland site caused advective and conductive thermal energies to be of equal importance to ground thaw. The absence of continuous surface flow at the peatland and valley sites led to dominance of conductive thermal energy over advective energy for ground thaw. The results suggest that the modified P,clet number could be a very useful parameter to differentiate landscape components in modeling frost table heterogeneity. The calculated water and energy fluxes, and the modified P,clet number provide quantitative explanations for the shallow soil moisture-ground thaw patterns by linking them with hydrological processes and hillslope storage capacity.

AB The importance of characterizing the ecohydrological interactions in natural, damaged/drained, and restored bogs is underscored by the importance of peatlands to global climate change and the growing need for peatland restoration. An understudied aspect of peatland ecohydrology is how shallow lateral flow impacts local hydrological conditions and water balance, which are critical for peatland restoration success. A novel method is presented using microcosms installed in the field to understand the dynamics of shallow lateral flow. Analysis of the difference in water table fluctuation inside and outside the microcosm experimental areas allowed the water balance to be constrained and the calculation of lateral flow and evapotranspiration. As an initial demonstration of this method, a series of four microcosm experiments were set up in locations with differing ecological quality and land management histories, on a raised bog complex in the midlands of Ireland. The timing and magnitude of the lateral flow differed considerably between locations with differing ecological conditions, indicating that shallow lateral flow is an important determining factor in the ecohydrological trajectory of a recovering bog system. For locations whereSphagnumspp. moss layer was present, a slow continuous net lateral input of water from the upstream catchment area supported the water table during drought periods, which was not observed in locations lackingSphagnum. Consistent with other studies, evapotranspiration was greater in locations with aSpaghnummoss layer than in locations with a surface of peat soil.

AB Ground water and Surface water interactions are of fundamental importance for the biogeochemical processes governing phosphorus (P) dynamics in riparian buffers. The four most important conceptual hydrological pathways for P losses from and P retention in riparian buffers are reviewed in this paper: (i) The diffuse flow path with ground water flow through the riparian aquifer, (ii) the overland flow path across the riparian buffer with water coming from adjacent agricultural fields, (iii) irrigation of the riparian buffer with tile drainage water from agricultural fields where disconnected tile drains irrigate the riparian buffer, and (iv) inundation of the riparian buffer (floodplain) with river water during short or longer periods. We have examined how the different flow paths in the :I riparian buffer influence P retention mechanisms theoretically and from empirical evidence. The different hydrological flow paths determine where and how water-borne P compounds meet and interact with iron and aluminum oxides or other minerals in the geochemical cycling of P in the complex and dynamic environment that constitutes a riparian buffer. The main physical process in the riparian buffer-sedimentation-is active along several flow paths and may account for P retention rates of up to 128 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1), while plant uptake may temporarily immobilize up to 15 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1). Retention of dissolved P in riparian buffers is not as pronounced as retention of particulate P and is often below 0.5 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1). Several studies show significant release of dissolved P (i.e., Lip to 8 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1)).

AB An understanding of the symbiotic water and gas exchange processes at the ecosystem scale is essential to the development of appropriate restoration plans of extracted peatlands. This paper presents ecosystem scale measurements of the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon dioxide (CO2) from a restored vacuum extracted peatland in eastern Quebec, utilizing full-scale micrometeorological measurements of both evaporation and CO2. The results indicate that the adopted restoration practices reduce the loss of water from the peat, but CO2 emissions are similar to 25% greater than an adjacent nonrestored comparison site. The blockage of drainage ditches and the existence of a mulch cover at the site keep the moisture conditions more or less constant. Consequently, the CO2 flux, which is predominantly soil respiration, is strongly controlled by peat temperature fluctuations. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ID GEOLOGICAL CONTROLS; FLOODPLAIN; RIVER
AB Dartmoor Vlei is a 42 ha unchannelled valley-bottom wetland located in the headwaters of the Mnyamvubu River in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, South Africa. The wetland and its catchment are underlain by a large dolerite sill that forms the Karkloof escarpment and plateau and the wetland terminates against a dolerite dyke that has intruded into the sill. The dolerite sill has been deeply weathered to depths in excess of 7 m, while the dolerite dyke at the toe of the wetland has not weathered such that water flows across bedrock at a depth of <0.2 m as it leaves the wetland. Coring established that the sedimentary fill overlying the weathered dolerite sill is generally <1 m thick, comprising upward fining sequences of sediment characterised by thin layers of sand and gravel at the contact with the weathered dolerite, which grade upwards into fine organic-rich silt sediments and peat at the surface. The wetland is characterised by a discontinuous stream. These findings confirm that the wetland evolved from a floodplain wetland characterised by laterally migrating meanders into a valley-bottom wetland characterised by peat accumulation with a discontinuous stream. The occurrence of a discontinuity between the residual saprolite beneath the wetland and fresh dolerite at the toe of the wetland indicates that the residual saprolite surface has sagged relative to the dolerite dyke. Chemical and mineralogical analyses of fresh and weathered dolerite confirmed that the chemical transformation of the dolerite sill bedrock into weathered products has resulted in both volume and thickness losses in the weathered dolerite sill mass. This has in turn resulted in sagging of the wetland surface over time, which was greatest at the head of the wetland and thus reduced the longitudinal slope downstream. This explains the extremely low energy conditions of Dartmoor Vlei and why the wetland is no longer shaped by lateral migration of meandering streams. The extensive chemical weathering of the dolerite sill underlying the wetland is attributed to the extremely long-time period that soils within the wetland have been saturated, given its occurrence on the African Erosion Surface.

AB Three permanent alpine springs and their associated pools in the Australian Alps were studied over a summer season to understand their hydrochemical function and characterise the (previously unreported) aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. These "source" pools represent an extremely limited habitat within Australian alpine peatlands and are likely vulnerable to groundwater flow changes associated with climate change. The pools provide an extremely stable habitat for 30 macroinvertebrate taxa in the harsh alpine environment with near chemostatic conditions and pool temperatures constrained to 5.6-6.3A degrees C despite air temperatures varying between -4.5A degrees C and 30.6A degrees C. Although small in area source pools have a significant effect on nitrate concentrations (decreases) and pH (increases) of waters flowing to downstream Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. The macroinvertebrate communities were distinctly different to that found in peatlands and headwater streams and were dominated by the amphipod Austrocrangonyx sp. (76.6% of total abundance), despite the low pH conditions (pH 5.27-5.56). Some of the macroinvertebrate taxa (Nannochorista, Anzacladius, and Parochlus) have a Gondwanan and circum-Antarctic distribution, similar to the bryophytes that also occur in these pools (Bartramia and Blindia). These source pools contribute to the diversity of alpine fauna and should be separately recognised and protected.

TI An Evaluation of Mitigation Measures to Reduce Impacts of Peat

   Brunswick, Canada
SO CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL
LA English

ID DRAINAGE; QUEBEC; MODEL
AB Tie evaluation of impacts of peat harvesting on riverine ecosystems is essential to the implementation of adequate mitigation measures. The objective of the present study was to determine the potential impacts of peat harvesting on the physical (e.g., flow, suspended sediment concentration (SSC), water temperature) and biological (fish abundance) parameters of the East Branch Portage River, New Brunswick. This study was initiated in 2005 and a before and after study design was used to assess impacts. When the operational activities were initiated (spring 2007), 19 ha of peatland (15% of the total area scheduled for harvesting) was drained. Tie exploited area was drained through a network of ditches which emptied into a sedimentation pond. Drained water subsequently flowed into a 250 m vegetated buffer zone and discharged into the East Branch Portage River. Drained water did not diffuse throughout the buffer zone as expected. Rather, water tended to concentrate in a natural depression (channel) in the buffer zone, thus connecting the outflow of the sedimentation pond directly to the river. Two main results deserve attention. First, elevated SSC events were recorded in the East Branch Portage River downstream of the confluence of the channel formed in the buffer zone and the river. Periods of elevated SSC Could be attributed to poor maintenance of the sedimentation pond. However, elevated SSC events were also recorded after pond maintenance and were concurrent with the timing of ditching activities within the peatland. Secondly, fish abundance was lower in 2007 compared to 2006 (pre-development period). However, potential impacts of peatland development on fish abundance Should be interpreted with caution at this stage of the study.

AB This paper investigates an alternative use of sterile aggregate materials which may arise from various construction applications in conjunction with other low-cost mineral raw materials to remediate the acid mine drainage phenomenon. This study is based on the combination of unprocessed mineral raw materials, as well as on the basic concept of the cyclic economy where the conversion of a waste into a raw material for another application can be achieved. In this study, in order to examine the remediation, in lab scale, of the drainage waste water of Agios Philippos mine, an experimental electrically continuous flow-driven forced device was constructed, enriching the research gap relative to this type of remediation approach. Through this experimental device, the use of certain mixes of mineral raw materials (serpentinite, andesite, magnesite, peat, and biochar) was studied. Our results focus on the impact of the studied mineral raw materials and especially on their synergy on the water purification potential under continuous water flow operation. Using the new 7-day experimental electrically continuous flow-driven forced device with certain mixes of mineral raw materials, the increase of pH values from 3.00 to 6.82 was achieved. Moreover, with use of the experimental device, the removal of toxic load was achieved, and more specifically the concentration of Fe was decreased from 6149 to 1300 ppb, Cu from 8847 to 35 ppb, and Zn from 285,458 to 50,000 ppb.

AB Montane fens are biologically diverse peat-forming wetlands that develop at points of groundwater discharge. To protect these ecosystems, it is critical to understand their locations on the landscape and the hydrogeologic systems that support them. The upper Deschutes Basin has a groundwater flow system that supports baseflow in many rivers, but little is known about the wetland types and groundwater dependence of the thousands of wetlands within the watershed. In 292 randomly selected wetlands, we quantified landscape metrics thought useful for discriminating montane fens from non-peat-forming wetlands. We inspected these wetlands and classified 67 of them as fens. Of the landscape metrics, only geology reliably differentiated fens from other types of wetlands. Nearly all fens develop in low-permeability glacial till found at approximately 1400-1800 m in elevation, and are concentrated in areas mantled by pumice deposits that originated primarily from the eruption of Mt. Mazama approximately 7700 years BP. Stratigraphic and hydrologic factors indicate the fens are supplied by perched aquifers in glacial till, instead of the deeper regional aquifer system. Their hydrogeologic setting makes the fens highly vulnerable to expected changes to recharge associated with climate change, but not to groundwater pumping from the regional aquifer.

ID EXPERIMENTAL WETLANDS
AB A former dewatered fen was flooded fora multi-purpose land use system including cattail production, fen protection, and water purification. These research plants with an area of 6 ha consist of three constructed surface-flow wetlands. The inflowing water is polluted by non-point sources due to intensive agriculture. The focus of this paper is the estimation of the potential of rewetted fens to reduce phosphorus and nitrogen. The dominating forms of nitrogen in the inflow are organic nitrogen and nitrate. The reduction rate is higher for nitrate than for organic nitrogen, although the nitrate reductions occur only during the summer season. If no nitrate is available for denitrification, there is a release of ammonia from the peat into the water. The main form of phosphorus in the in- and outflow is ortho-phosphate. In contrast to the values of nitrate, the concentrations of phosphorus are very regular with no significant seasonal pattern.
   When nitrate isn't available in the water any more, the release of phosphorus begins and the rewetted fens change from a sink for phosphorus to a source of it. Rewetted fens can be a sink for phosphorus and nitrogen with nitrate as the limiting factor. Only if denitrification can occur, can the release of ammonia and phosphorus from the peat layer be prevented.

AB The Tea Bag Index (TBI) method was used to estimate the litter decomposition rate in peatland exposed for climate manipulation (increased temperature and reduced precipitation) at two contrasting sites differing in water table depth (WTD) dynamics. To manipulate climate on peatland, the prototyped Open Top Chambers (OTC) and automated rain-out shelters were used. OTCs increased daytime air temperatures by similar to 1.7 degrees C at the driest plots exposed for an increase of air temperature and reduced precipitation, while the increase of the average daily air temperature was lower than 0.9 degrees C. However, OTCs cooled down the peat temperature even by 0.8 degrees C and this effect was most pronounced for daytime rather than night-time conditions. The precipitation amount was reduced by 26%. The tea bags were buried at 8 cm depth for 83 and 172 days starting from the 19th of April 2019. Our observation proved that although decomposition rates were dependent on temperature, WTD and its fluctuations are the main factors controlling the rates of litter decomposition in waterlogged ecosystems like ours. At waterlogged Sphagnum-dominated peatlands, the interrelation between different environmental factors may mitigate the impact of warming and reduced precipitation on litter decomposition.

TI Assessment of Components of the Water Balance of Drained Peatbog

DE water balance; peatland; dreinage; catchment
AB The need of the best utilization of water resources of catchments in Lubelszczyzna, results from the fact that region the water scarce areas of Poland. In addition this deficit is gradually deepening, when the annual sum of precipitation does not excess 550 mm. Improvement of water reserves in habitats is one of aims of so-called small retention.
   The object of study is to analyze the size of the components of the water balance in dreinage river valleys micro-catchments of peatland. The study used the results of research and field observations from the years 2010 - 14. Catchment ditch K-2 is located in the Sosnowica - Piwonia river basin. The catchment area of the ditch is 0.46 km2 and is 86% as a one-crop seminatural meadows land use. The soil cover is dominated by degraded soil muck-peat (MtIIbb). In the catchment area 75% of the habitat moorshed and moist with a high groundwater level.
   Carried out investigations indicate significant impact of meteorological conditions as well as habitats on runoff index and retention changes in analyzed hydrological years. The highest rates occurred in the summer half of the outflow year 2009/10, and have been associated with heavy rainfall in May and in August and September. They amounted to 90 mm and were almost three times higher than in an average year, similar to 2011/12. Water flow is composed equally of surface runoff and underground outflow. This balance is particularly true with regard to the flatness of the terrain and reduced absorbency of hindering drainage. Especially during the spring thaw the soil can not accumulate large amounts of water. Retention observed changes were low, because of the high capillary rise of organic soils. The observed mediocre in the year negative value retention demonstrates the need for irrigation of the land.
   Studies have confirmed the dominant role of surface evaporation in the water balance. This is evidenced by the lower outflows in the first half year compared to the first half of the winter and fall in the average retention. High evaporation mainly favors the occurrence of shallow water and the air temperature. Potential evapotranspiration of grassland areas sufficiently moisture exceed 500 mm.
   The resulting work results differ from the calculation for the Leczna-Wlodawa Lakeland. Indicator values for the period 1951-1995 are: rainfall 550 mm, 108 mm outflow, evaporation 442 mm, changing retention assumed 0 mm. While the similar results were achieved with research conducted in the catchment ditch the G-8, where in a normal water outflow amounted to 102 mm, and retention decreased by 33 mm.

AB Hydrological dynamics act as a primary control on ecosystem function in mountain peatlands, serving as an important regulator of carbon fluxes. In western North America, mountain peatlands exist in different hydro geological settings, across a range climatic conditions, and vary in floristic composition. The sustainability of these ecosystems, particularly those at the low end of their known elevation range, is susceptible to a changing climate via changes in the water cycle. We conducted a hydrological investigation of two mountain peatlands, with differing vegetation, hydrogeological setting (sloping vs basin), and climate (strong vs weak monsoon influence). Growing season saturated zone water budgets were modeled on a daily basis, and subsurface flow characterizations were performed during multiple field campaigns at each site. The sloping peatland expectedly showed a strong lateral groundwater potential gradient throughout the growing season. Alternatively, the basin peatland had low lateral gradients but more pronounced vertical gradients. A zero-flux plane was apparent at a depth of approximately 50 cm below the peat surface at the basin peatland; shallow groundwater above this depth moved upward towards the surface via evapotranspiration. The differences in groundwater flow dynamics between the two sites also influenced water budgets. Higher groundwater inflow at the sloping peatland offset higher rates of evapotranspiration losses from the saturated zone, which were apparently driven by differences in vegetative cover. This research revealed that although sloping peatlands cover relatively small portions of mountain watersheds, they provide unique settings where vegetation directly utilizes groundwater for transpiration, which were several-fold higher than typically reported for surrounding uplands.

DT Article
ID GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR; BLANKET PEAT; RUNOFF; INFILTRATION; PIPEFLOW
AB This paper presents, for the first time, evidence to show that Calluna species are one causative factor of piping in blanket peat catchments. Ground-penetrating radar survey on 960 plots illustrated that piping was prevalent throughout blanket peats. However, soil pipe occurrence was significantly higher where bare peat (149 pipes/ km) or Calluna (87 pipes/ km) were present compared to other species (67 pipes/ km). A case study catchment where there was an altitudinal limit to Calluna provided some control over potential factors that may lead to an association between piping and Calluna. Under the controlled conditions of topographic index, peat depth, and water table, piping was greater under the Calluna-covered peat than under other vegetation covers. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that 10 years worth of rainfall was enough to almost double the proportion of macropore flow occurring in recently colonized Calluna peatlands. This suggests that given enough water and time, the woody Calluna plants result in water being preferentially channeled through the upper peat. Improvements are therefore required in our understanding of the relationships between peatland plant nutrient and water supply and the feedbacks between ecosystem functioning and landform development. These results are also important given the propensity to encourage Calluna growth for game bird enhancement in many northern peatlands.

AB As most ecosystems, peatlands have been heavily exploited for different human purposes. For example, in Finland the majority is under forestry, agriculture or peat mining use. Peatlands play an important role in carbon storage, water cycle, and are a unique habitat for rare organisms. Such properties highlight their environmental importance and the need for their restoration. To monitor the success of peatland restoration sensitive indicators are needed. Here we test whether testate amoebae can be used as a reliable bioindicator for assessing peatland condition. To qualify as reliable indicators, responses in testate amoebae community structure to ecological changes must be stronger than random spatial and temporal variation. In this study, we simultaneously assessed differences between the effects of seasonality, intermediate scale spatial variation and land uses on living testate amoebae assemblages in natural, forested and restored peatlands. We expected the effects of seasonality on testate amoebae communities to be less pronounced than those of land use and within site variation. On average, natural sites harboured the highest richness and density, while the lowest numbers were found at forestry sites. Despite small changes observed in taxa dominance and differences in TA community structure between seasons and years at some sites, spatial heterogeneity, temperature, pH, nor water table depth seemed to significantly affect testate amoebae communities. Instead, observed differences were related to type of land use, which explained 75% of the community variation. Our results showed that testate amoebae community monitoring is a useful tool to evaluate impacts of human land use on boreal peatlands.

AB Drepanocladus turgescens is a moss of arctic-alpine distribution, very rare and declining in Central Europe, in the past known in Poland from four relict sites in the small basin area in the central Silesia-Cracow Upland (southern Poland), the only sites of the species in Central Europe outside the Alps. All of them were considered extinct thirty years ago. In May 2011 a new site was discovered in the same upland basin, only a few kilometers from the previous localities. The species occurs quite abundantly in patches of extremely rich-fen (Caricion davallianae alliance) of semi-natural origin, mostly in shallow depressions with slightly flowing, spring calcareous water, occasionally drying out.

AB Peatlands are ecosystems for which carbon budget relies strongly on the meteorological and hydrological conditions. Here, using a manipulative field experiment, we measured ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) over two years (2013-2014) in a poor fen in Poland to estimate the carbon emission in a changing climate. The experiment consisted of warming (open-top chambers - OTC) and water table manipulation. The application of OTC increased the mean values of daily maximum air temperature by approx. 1.1-1.8 A degrees C. Warming or the increased water table depth separately resulted in an increase in ecosystem respiration by approx. 0.1 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) and 0.3 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), respectively. However, our results show also the additive nature of warming and water table drawdown impact on daily R-ECO during the studied years (2013-0.80 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) and 2014-1.16 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). With the natural dry period event which occurred in 2014, the seasonal R-ECO increased by approx. 0.2 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) as compared to the previous year. Projected global warming will therefore significantly enhance C loss from poor fens in this region of Europe.

AB Variations in sulphate (SO42-) concentration of porewater and net SO42- mobilization were related to differences in water level fluctuations during wet and dry summers in two conifer swamps located in catchments which differed in till depth and seasonality of groundwater flow. Sulphate depletion at the surface and in 20 cm porewater coincided with anoxia and occurred mainly during the summer when water levels were near the peat surface and water flow rates were low in both catchments. There was an inverse relationship between net SO42- mobilization and water level elevation relative to the peat surface, explaining variation in SO42- dynamics between the swamps during summer drought periods. Aeration of peat to 40 cm and a large net SO42- mobilization (10-70 mg SO42- m(-2) d(-1)) occurred during a dry summer in which the water level dropped to 60 cm below the surface in the swamp receiving ephemeral groundwater inputs from shallow tills within the catchment. This resulted in high SO42- concentrations in the surface water and porewater (30-50 mg L-1), and elevated SO42- concentrations remained through the fall and winter. In contrast, within the swamp located in the catchment with greater till depth (> 1 m), continuous groundwater inputs maintained surface saturation during the dry summer, and SO42- mobilization and concentrations of SO42- in the pore water during the following fall did not increase. Susceptibility to large water table drawdown and mobilization of accumulated SO42- is influenced by the occurrence of ephemeral vs. continuous groundwater inputs to valley swamps during dry summer periods in the Canadian Shield landscape. This study reveals that extrapolation of results of SO42- cycling from one wetland to another requires knowledge of the hydrogeology of the catchment in which the wetlands are located.

AB Afforestation is a significant cause of global peatland degradation. In some regions, afforested bogs are now undergoing clear-felling and restoration, often known as forest-to-bog restoration. We studied differences in watertable depth (WTD) and porewater chemistry between intact, afforested, and restored bogs at a raised bog and blanket bog location. Solute concentrations and principal component analysis suggested that water-table drawdown and higher electrical conductivity (EC) and ammonium (NH4-N) concentrations were associated with afforestation. In contrast, higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and phosphate (PO4-P) concentrations were associated with deforestation. Drying-rewetting cycles influenced seasonal variability in solute concentrations, particularly in shallower porewater at the raised bog location. WTD was significantly deeper in the oldest raised bog restoration site (similar to 9 years post-restoration) than the intact bog (mean difference = 62 cm). However, WTD in the oldest blanket bog restoration site (similar to 17 years post-restoration), where furrows had been blocked, was comparable to the intact bog (mean difference = 1.2 cm). When averaged for all porewater depths, NH4-N concentrations were significantly higher in the afforested than the intact sites (mean difference = 0.77 mg L-1) whereas significant differences between the oldest restoration sites and the intact sites included higher PO4-P (mean difference = 70 mu g L-1) in the raised bog and higher DOC (mean difference 5.6 mg L-1), EC (mean difference 19 mu S cm(-1)) and lower SUVA(254) (mean difference = 0.13 L mg(-1) m(-1)) in the blanket bog. Results indicate felled waste (brash) may be a significant source of soluble C and PO4-P. Mean porewater PO4-P concentrations were between two and five times higher in furrows and drains in which brash had accumulated compared to other locations in the same sites where brash had not accumulated. Creating and maintaining brash-free buffer zones may therefore minimise freshwater impacts. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The depth distributions of anaerobic microbial methane production and potential aerobic microbial methane oxidation were assessed at several sites in both Sphagnum- and sedge-dominated boreal peatlands in Sweden, and compared with net methane emissions from the same sites. Production and oxidation of methane were measured in peat slurries, and emissions were measured with the closed-chamber technique. Over all eleven sites sampled, production was, on average, highest 12 cm below the depth of the average water table. On the other hand, highest potential oxidation of methane coincided with the depth of the average water table. The integrated production rate in the 0-60 cm interval ranged between 0.05 and 1.7 g CH4 m(-2) day(-1) and was negatively correlated with the depth of the average water table (linear regression: r(2) = 0.50, P = 0.015). The depth-integrated potential CH4-oxidation rate ranged between 3.0 and 22.1 g CH4 m(-2) day(-1) and was unrelated to the depth of the average water table. A larger fraction of the methane was oxidized at sites with low average water tables; hence, our results show that low net emission rates in these environments are caused not only by lower methane production rates, but also by conditions more favorable for the development of CH4-oxidizing bacteria in these environments.

AB Water circulation in the peat bog of a maar depression in the Massif Central (France) was traced with lithium isotopes on water samples collected in the area from springs, surface- and groundwaters, as well as on solid samples taken from peat bogs.
   Lithium contents fluctuate significantly in the groundwaters, ranging from 0.01 mu mol L(-1) in springs feeding the peat bog, up to 28 mu mol L(-1) in the groundwater collected in the peat bog. Lithium-isotope compositions (delta(7)Li, parts per thousand) are extremely variable within the site, ranging from +12 parts per thousand in the stream draining the area up to a (7)Li-rich value of + 1226 parts per thousand in groundwater from the peat bog. The delta(7)Li values in the streams agree with those reported in the literature for surface waters, while those of groundwater are far beyond the range of values measured in nature. In the present study, we explain the extremely enriched (7)Li signature of the groundwaters by an external input due to Ca-amendment, used in local agriculture. The relationships between U content and Ca, Mg and HCO(3) as well as the lack of a relationship between Li and Na plead in favour of (7)Li-enriched carbonate amendments. This hypothesis was tested by Li-isotope analyses on the peat and on several amendment samples (carbonates and NPK fertilizers), confirming the potential role of amendments in the control of Li isotopes in peat land groundwater and showing high delta(7)Li values in fertilizers. Application of delta(7)Li ratios to peat land waters provides a unique perspective on the hydrogeochemical dynamics at the scale of this site, as the delta(7)Li values for the surface water were quasi constant throughout the survey period, and the peat land groundwater does not supply the surface-water runoff and may evolve as a stagnant system. To conclude, the water within the peat land exhibits very high delta(7)Li values consistent with artificially enriched (7)Li associated with Ca amendments. This study opens a new field for Li isotope investigations in hydro-systems and highlights the possibility of using Li isotopes as environmental tracers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FLOODPLAIN WETLAND; NARBOROUGH-BOG
AB The valley mire 'Mittletes Trebeltal' in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania (northeast Germany) has recently been re-wetted in the course of an EU-funded conservation project. On the basis of geological cross-sections, a hydrological model applying the Boussinesq-equation has been developed to investigate the hydrological dynamics of the study area and to evaluate various management strategies. Modelled water levels corresponded well to measured ones. The optimised values of two of the main model parameters-the hydraulic conductivity and the proportions of vegetation types-agreed with measurement values, and, respectively, the real vegetation cover, while the third one, the specific yield, should pragmatically be used as a calibration parameter. Due to a proportion of around 30% of tall fen vegetation, the modelled evapotranspiration clearly exceeded grass evapotranspiration resulting in low groundwater levels in some parts of the fen during summer. Generally, the water levels are controlled by topographic features (i.e. former peat cuttings) and weather conditions during the summer months. When analyzing different management scenarios, even an optimal water supply (ditch water levels near the ground surface) could not raise the groundwater table to ecologically sound levels during summer. However, during winter, these ditch water levels enhanced flooding. The groundwater fluxes towards the river, and, respectively, towards the fen were low. The minor importance of these fluxes for the water balance was caused by very low hydraulic gradients. Therefore, it can be concluded that the risk of nutrient export from the fen into the river is very limited and compound transformations take place within the mire system itself. Hydrological analysis as a prerequisite for the assessment of nutrient and pollutant transport and transformation processes can be carried out-as a first approach-with simple models on the basis of a limited dataset.

AB Continuous measurements of ecosystem scale evapotranspiration (ET) were obtained using the eddy covariance method over the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons (May-September) at three adjacent peatlands that have undergone long-term water table manipulation. The three (wet, dry and intermediate) sites represent peatlands along a hydrological gradient, with different average depths to water table (WTD) and different resulting vegetation and microform assemblages. The 2010 growing season was warmer and wetter than normal, while 2011 conditions were near normal. The difference in maximum daily ET values (95th percentiles) between sites were greater in 2010 (3.14 mm d(-1) -4.17 mm d(-1)) compared to 2011 (3.68 mm d(-1) -3.95 mm d(-1)), yielding cumulative growing season ET that followed the wet to dry gradient in both 2010 and 2011. Synoptic weather conditions (i.e. air temperature, vapour pressure deficit, and incoming solar radiation, etc.) could not explain differences in ET between sites due to their proximity to one another. Peat surface wetness was more spatially homogeneous at the wet site due to small average microtopographic variations (0.15 m) compared to the intermediate (0.30 m) and dry (0.41 m) sites. Although average Bowen ratios were less than one at all three sites, greater surface wetness and heating at the wettest site lead to differences in energy partitioning, with higher average Bowen ratios at the sites with a shallow average WTD. No significant relation between normalized ET and WTD was found at any of the sites that were consistent across both study years. In addition, the lack of a relation between ET and near-surface moisture suggests that the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and the boundary layer resistance created by the vascular canopy combined with low surface roughness limits evaporative losses from the peat surface. This study suggests that the low ET of a dry site compared to a wet site may be due to the impact of a long-term change in WTD on leaf area and the relative distribution of plant functional groups.

AB The hydrology of a cutover fen was studied from May to October in 1995 and 1996. Rainfall equivalent depths were measured every 15 min and stream runoff was continuously monitored. Water table depths were measured bi-weekly during 1995 and continuously during 1996. Storm runoff was separated into different components; rain falling directly into channels and rapid groundwater response based on a contributing area method and on different electrical conductivities of rain-, ground- and streamwater. The results show three sources of storm runoff from cutover fens. Frequent small runoff peaks were caused by rain falling directly into channels. The amount of quick runoff increased when rain fell on wet soil, resulting in intermediate sized runoff peaks generated by rapid groundwater response. The largest runoff values were observed after prolonged rainfall when water from the upper part of the catchment flooded the fen. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB I evaluated production and decomposition characteristics of six dominant Sphagnum species in their natural microhabitats distributed along the gradient of water table in an open ombrotrophic bog. The growth in length was much higher in pools and hollows than in hummocks but the resulting annual production was roughly similar in the microhabitats due to a greater shoot density and consequently higher bulk density in hummocks. Although hummocks provided much higher potential for decomposition than hollows, the Sphagnum litter decomposed more slowly in hummocks due to much lower litter quality of the hummock sphagna. Thus the hummock Sphagnum species possess both principal mechanisms participating in maintaining hummocks above hollows - a sufficient production rate and limited decomposition rate. These mechanisms emphasize the role of Sphagnum mosses as autogenic ecosystem engineers controlling also the microhabitat diversification in patterned mires.

AB Permafrost peatlands store large amounts of carbon potentially vulnerable to decomposition. However, the fate of that carbon in a changing climate remains uncertain in models due to complex interactions among hydrological, biogeochemical, microbial, and plant processes. In this study, we estimated effects of climate forcing biases present in global climate reanalysis products on carbon cycle predictions at a thawing permafrost peatland in subarctic Sweden. The analysis was conducted with a comprehensive biogeochemical model (ecosys) across a permafrost thaw gradient encompassing intact permafrost palsa with an ice core and a shallow active layer, partly thawed bog with a deeper active layer and a variable water table, and fen with a water table close to the surface, each with distinct vegetation and microbiota. Using in situ observations to correct local cold and wet biases found in the Global Soil Wetness Project Phase 3 (GSWP3) climate reanalysis forcing, we demonstrate good model performance by comparing predicted and observed carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchanges, thaw depth, and water table depth. The simulations driven by the bias-corrected climate suggest that the three peatland types currently accumulate carbon from the atmosphere, although the bog and fen sites can have annual positive radiative forcing impacts due to their higher CH4 emissions. Our simulations indicate that projected precipitation increases could accelerate CH4 emissions from the palsa area, even without further degradation of palsa permafrost. The GSWP3 cold and wet biases for this site significantly alter simulation results and lead to erroneous active layer depth (ALD) and carbon budget estimates. Biases in simulated CO2 and CH4 exchanges from biased climate forcing are as large as those among the thaw stages themselves at a landscape scale across the examined permafrost thaw gradient. Future studies should thus not only focus on changes in carbon budget associated with morphological changes in thawing permafrost, but also recognize the effects of climate forcing uncertainty on carbon cycling.

AB This paper describes a fossil record from northeastern Poland of Sphagnum obtusum Warnst., a plant that has rarely been found in Holocene sediments. This species occurred circa 1710-1570 cal. BP on Mechacz Wielki peatland and was present in the transitional phase between a fen that developed on lake sediments and a bog. Sphagnum obtusum was a dominant species and was accompanied by such vascular plants such as Scheuchzeria palustris, Carex rostrata, Comarum palustre and Oxycoccus palustris. Using testate amoebae, we reconstructed the past habitat (water table and pH), with S. obtusum occurring in a moderately wet habitat (mean depth to the water table or DWT = 9.5, SD = 0.5) and under slightly acid conditions (mean pH = 5, SD = 0.1). A clear correlation was found between the distributions of the subfossil S. obtusum and those of the indicator testate amoebae Hyalosphenia papilio and Cyclopyxis arcelloides. The disappearance of S. obtusum is assumed to have been caused by a trophic shift and succession of a more acidophilic species, Sphagnum angustifolium.

AB Climate change and gullies (and ditches) on peatlands are well known factors altering peat hydrology. Yet, exactly how this alteration emerges from interaction of these factors with groundwater dynamics is still not fully understood. In this study, we tackled this issue by coupling field measurement with model simulation using Visual MODFLOW. Groundwater processes and the associated water budget during five months of the wet season, 2017 were examined in the Zoige peatland, located on the northeastern side of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China with elevations of 3400-3900 m. Simulations were performed for a peatland area of 3.89 x 10(4) m(2) and three sub-zones within it representing peatland with no gullies (NG), a deep gully cutting through the peat layer (CT), and a shallow gully whose bed is within the peat layer (NCT). Model input parameters were calibrated and validated using the field-measured data. Modeling outcomes led to water budget showing relative contributions of main hydrological pathways (MHPs) (i.e., precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), gully, groundwater flow, and boundary) to changes of water storage in peats (AS). Although these MHPs varied differently during rain and inter-rain periods, AS values were mainly controlled by the oscillated trend of the difference between P and ET. Variations of MHPs caused by NCT and CT were secondary to those due to those of P and ET during the wet season referred to as the short-term climate change. Vertical groundwater (VGW) flows were strongly correlated with water table (WT) levels in both rain and inter-rain periods, but their directions had different patterns in the two periods. Horizontal groundwater (HGW) flows tended to move into the deep (CT) gully, while move from the shallow (NCT) gully to the neighbor peats during both periods. Since HGW flows were about ten times greater than VGW ones, their effect on AS was significant during the long dry season. This would lead to continuous loss of groundwater stored in peats, demonstrating the coupled effect of long-term climate change and gullies on AS. These findings underline the necessity of controlling gully development and avoiding ditch excavation in future Zoige peatland management practices.

AB Peatlands are one of the major natural sources of methane (CH4), but the level of CH4 efflux is uncertain, especially in alpine peatlands. In this study, CH4 emission fluxes from natural and drained peatlands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, southwest China, were measured from June to October in 2013 using the opaque static chamber technique and the Fast Greenhouse Gas Analyzer (DLT-100, Los Gatos Research Corp.). CH4 emission fluxes ranged from 2.07 to 56.33 mg m(-2) h(-1) in natural peatlands and from 0.02 to 0.42 mg m(-2) h(-1) in drained peatlands. Mean CH4 emission flux was 19.13 mg m(-2) h(-1) in natural peatlands and 0.14 mg m(-2) h(-1) in drained peatlands. These results showed that drainage led to a significant decrease in CH4 emissions. CH4 emission fluxes for all sampling plots were significantly correlated with variation in water table depth for linear (R (2) = 0.453, P < 0.01) and exponential functions (R (2) = 0.429, P < 0.01).

The particular scientific effort utilized remotely sensed data, GIS techniques and hydrologic modeling to estimate land use alterations during a 40-years period as well as associated changes in hydrologic parameters such as overland and underground flow, infiltration, evapotranspiration and water storages on ground surface. The results indicated significant variations in the hydrologic regime including a 6% increase in the annual evapotranspiration and a 10% increase in the soil water deficit that impose substantial impacts on the regional wetlands.

AB Hydrological effects of groundwater abstraction near a Danish river valley have been assessed by integrated hydrological modelling. The study site contains groundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems in terms of fen and spring habitats that are highly dependent on regional and local scale hydrology. Fens are rare and threatened worldwide due to pressures from agriculture, to lack of appropriate management and to altered catchment hydrology. A solid foundation for hydrological modelling was established based on intensive monitoring at the site, combined with full-scale pumping tests in the area. A regional groundwater model was used to describe the dynamics in groundwater recharge and the large-scale discharge to streams. A local grid refinement approach was then applied in a detailed assessment of damage in order to balance the computational effort and the need for a high spatial resolution. A considerable flow reduction in the natural spring was monitored during a full-scale pumping test while no significant effects on the water table in the fen habitats were observed. A modelled abstraction scenario predicted a lowering of 2-3 cm in the centre of the main fen area during summer periods. The predicted change in water table conditions in the fen habitat is compared to the variability found in 35 Danish fens, and the ecological response is discussed based on statistical water-level vegetation relations. The results provide a rare quantitative foundation for decision making in relation to management of groundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Bryophyte growth and production can be critical measurements in quantifying carbon input into peatlands. For any species, total biomass produced in a given year is determined by three main factors: abundance of the species, bulk density, and annual (length) increment. We examined the relationship of these parameters to environmental factors (water table depth, tree canopy cover) and biotic interactions (presence of other species) in seven common peatland bryophytes. Correlations suggest that bulk density changed in response to environmental variation in Sphagnum angustifolium (C.aJens. ex Russ.) C.aJens. in Tolf, Sphagnumafuscum (Schimp.) Klinggr., and Aulacomnium palustre (Hedw.) Schwaegr., and it remained constant in Pleurozium schreberi (Brid.) Mitt., Hylocomium splendens (Hedw.) Schimp. in B.S.G., Tomenthypnum nitens (Hedw.) Loeske, and Hamatocaulis vernicosus (Mitt.) Hedenas. Length increment was dependent on water table depth in S.aangustifolium, P.aschreberi, and Hamatocaulisavernicosus, and changed with canopy cover in H.asplendens at one of two sites examined. Overall, our results suggest that (i) in some species, changes in bulk density are likely to be an important component of changes in productivity in response to environmental variation; (ii) local vigour tends to increase with abundance, but may not do so in all cases; and (iii) phenomena such as biotic interactions and environmental extremes may lead to non-linearity of productivity responses to environmental change.

AB Sphagnum bogs cover large continental areas and may play a major role as carbon sinks. They have also great biological, historical and palcoecological values. These features led to a large amount of research and publications, especially conceptual and numerical models in various scientific fields. Drawing on this literature, we propose an integrated conceptual model of bog functioning. The model is built on 8 basic assumptions acting at two scales: the ecosystem as a whole, the bog or mesotope and the microforms, the elementary systemic units. Five kinds of ecological constraints driving the ecosystem are defined too. Based on the assumptions, the constraints and bibliographical data, thresholds and positive and negative feedbacks are elucidated. The negative feedbacks controlling the development and homeostasis of the ecosystem are related to the balance between the vegetation which builds the peat body, the shape of the later and the water fluxes passing through it. The positive feedback allowing the establishment and the persistence of the ecosystem is related to peat moss engineering. Four positive feedback loops can stop the peat production, and lead to the destruction of the bog. Two loops are biological processes involving trees and blue moor grass (Molinia caerulea) which spread onto the bog. The two other loops are related to soil and shape disturbance and changes in production and degradation of the organic matter. The model is especially designed to help ecological monitoring and highlights the importance of an ecological diagnostic integrating plants, soil and water fluxes. Based on this model, action plans should focus on maintaining the negative feedbacks and the peat moss engineering while stopping the unfavourable other positive feedback loops.

AB New field techniques were developed and tested to evaluate peat storativity and hydraulic conductivity in a Boreal fen. Enclosed drainage tests and pumping tests were successfully completed in the thawed peat above an impermeable frozen layer and then repeated when the peat was fully thawed. A loading test experiment constrained values of vertical hydraulic conductivity within an order of magnitude for the peat below a depth of 2 m. An inherent advantage of these tests is that volumes of undisturbed peat on the scale of cubic metres may be characterized. Storativity of the fen peat as determined by enclosed drainage tests ranged from about 1.0 at the peat surface to 0.35 at a water table depth of 0.15 m. Laboratory drainage tests of peat cores gave similar, but widely scattered results. Hydraulic conductivity near the surface was as high as 9.0 x 10(-3) ms(-1) determined with pumping tests and in the range of 10(-6) to 10(-5) ms(-1) below a depth of 2 m, estimated with the loading test. Slug tests gave similar results. Pumping tests, enclosed storativity tests and loading tests are practical large-scale field tests for determining peat properties.

AB A high-resolution plant macrofossil analysis was applied to investigate wetness dynamics in a southern Finnish boreal bog, Kontolanrahka, during the last 5000 years. The chronological control and the age-depth model were based on 40 AMS radiocarbon dates. Pollen analysis provided information oil regional-scale vegelation changes. Macrofossil analysis revealed prominent changes in vegetation assemblages during the late Holocene, indicating fluctuations in water-table. The reconstruction Suggests that at the coring point, which nowadays is a relatively wet lawn, habitat type has repeatedly varied between transient communities similar to those currently represented in city hummocks, very wet lawns and even hollows. In order to quantify historical changes in water-table, Generalized Additive Models (GAM) were used to investigate the current relationships between surface plant species and water-table depth. Modern water-table measurements and a survey of associated plant communities along moisture gradients provided data for GAM-analyses. The plant species showed unimodal distributions with apparent optima and narrow tolerances along the water-table gradient. A transfer function for water-table reconstruction was created by calibrating plant macrofossil records against the modern vegetation/water-table relationship Using the weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) regression method. The quantitative water-table reconstruction for the late Holocene showed that the water-table depth had varied between 38 and 2.5 cm, the root mean square error of prediction being 3 cm. The detected historical wet and dry shifts were compared with other similar data from Finland, Sweden and Estonia, and from Western Europe. Despite some similarities, especially during the last c. 1000 years, noticeable differences in timing and duration occur, suggesting they may not have been driven only by climate, but also by local factors, including surface fires.

AB Methane emissions from northern peatlands are strongly dependent on soil temperatures. Therefore, to predict methane emissions from northern peatlands under future climatic conditions, it is important to simulate the effect of these changing climatic conditions on peat temperatures. This article reports on the development and testing of two one-dimensional (1D) models used to simulate soil temperatures at shallow depths in a northern peatland. First, the HIP-Dlet (Heat in Peat - Dirichlet) model applies measured temperatures to the surface boundary of a conduction-based temperature model. Secondly, the HIP-Nmann (Heat in Peat - von Neumann) model simulates the surface boundary from standard meteorological measurements. The HIP-Dlet model provides a reasonable to good approximation of measured temperatures showing that heat transport processes within the soil are adequately simulated. The model does not simulate an advective liquid heat flux. However, only substantial rainfall events (> 70 mm over 3 days) during the study period had any significant effect on model error. Errors in the HIP-Nmann model were of a similar magnitude to the HIP-Dlet model. Errors in the HIP-Dlet model resulted predominantly from errors in the measured soil temperatures. Errors in the HIP-Nmann were due to errors in the measured soil temperatures and the inaccurate simulation of the surface boundary condition. The development of future peatland temperature models should, therefore, focus on the simulation of the surface boundary condition, particularly the parameterisation of the surface resistance that is shown here to produce significant errors in the modelled soil temperatures.

AB Peatlands store globally significant quantities of soil carbon, and Sphagnum moss is the main peat forming vegetation type in bogs. Sphagnum moss productivity is driven by the moisture content of its apical cluster of branches, the capitulum. Capitulum moisture content is dependent on the arrangement of leaves, branches and stems for a given species and also on hydrological conditions of the underlying peat. Despite this link, the response of CO2 exchange in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands to extreme drought is still unclear, particularly under field conditions.
   We used drainage to expose Sphagnum rubellum to extreme drought and monitored water table, volumetric water content (VWC), gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) at plots in a 25 m transect perpendicular to a deep drainage ditch and compared results to an undrained site. VWC in the upper 10 cm of peat was strongly related to water table at depths shallower than 55 cm. Below this depth, near surface VWC remained relatively constant between 25 and 28% and Sphagnum GEP was effectively shut down. This also resulted in decreased ER at these locations. The combined effect was a linear relationship between VWC and NEE with moist sites acting as net CO2 sinks (up to -5 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)) whereas sites closest to the ditch were consistently small carbon sources. We suggest that understanding how climate change will alter peatland hydrology relative to the moisture thresholds of Sphagnum mosses is critical to determining the fate of their carbon sink function.

AB In this study, we used bi-temporal airborne lidar data to compare changes in vegetation height proximal to anthropogenic disturbances in the Oil Sands Region of Alberta, Canada. We hypothesize that relatively low impact disturbances such as seismic lines will increase the fragmentation of wetlands, resulting in shrub growth. Bi-temporal lidar data collected circa 2008 and 2018 were used to identify correspondence between the density of anthropogenic disturbances, wetland shape complexity and changes in vegetation height within >1800 wetlands near Fort McKay, Alberta, Canada. We found that up to 50% of wetlands were disturbed by anthropogenic disturbance in some parts of the region, with the highest proportional disturbance occurring within fens. Areas of dense anthropogenic disturbance in bogs resulted in increased growth and expansion of shrubs, while we found the opposite to occur in fens and swamps during the 10-year period. Up to 30% of bogs had increased shrubification, while shrub changes in fens and swamps varied depending on density of disturbance and did not necessarily correspond with shrub growth. As wetland shapes became increasingly elongated, the prevalence of shrubs declined between the two time periods, which may be associated with hydrological drivers (e.g. elongated may indicate surface and ground-water discharge influences). The results of this study indicate that linear disturbances such as seismic lines, considered to have relatively minimal impacts on ecosystems, can impact proximal wetland shape, fragmentation and vegetation community changes, especially in bogs.

AB Peatlands drained for agriculture are sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Resulting emissions may depend on land-use, often as grassland or cropland, but few studies have directly compared the effects of land-uses. Here, we measured annual emissions of CO2, N2O and methane (CH4) from five sites in a temperate bog, representing an undrained natural bog (NB) site, and four drained sites used as permanent grassland (PG) and croplands with rotations of oat-potato, oat-spring barley and potato-spring barley (PO:SB) in the study year. Gas fluxes were measured at 1-2 week intervals using static chambers, and auxiliary data were obtained, such as temperature, depth of water table, ratio-vegetation index, pH and soil mineral N. Annual CO2 emissions were derived from empirical modelling, whereas CH4 and N2O emissions were linearly interpolated between measurement dates by bootstrapping. Soil respiration was lower at the NB site (1.8 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1)) than at the drained sites where emissions were in the range of 5.0-8.8 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1). The N2O emission was negligible at NB (0.3 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)), low at three of the drained sites (1.5-3.7 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)), but high at PO:SB (37.7 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)). The CH4 emission was high at NB (172 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1)), but negligible at the drained sites (-1.5 to 1.5 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1)). The soil respiration at the drained sites indicated that peat losses were rather similar among the different cropping systems and depended mostly on drainage status, although soil respiration and peat mineralization may not scale directly. The pattern of N2O emissions suggested an increased risk of N2O emission from potato cultivation before and after the period of potato growth, likely due to microbial availability of NO3- outside the growing season. For initiatives aiming at reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural peat soils, this means that, e.g., conversion from cropland to permanent grassland should preferably be accompanied by measures of rewetting, whereas for potato cropping, N availability outside the growing season should be minimized.

AB Peatlands are characterized by their large carbon (C) storage capacity and represent important C sinks globally. In southern Chile, young peatlands (few centuries old) have originated due to clearcutting or fire at forest sites with high precipitation on poorly drained soils. These novel ecosystems are called anthropogenic peatlands here. Their role in the regional C cycle remains largely unknown. Here, we present 18 months of eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) in an anthropogenic peatland in northern Chiloe Island, part of which is kept undisturbed for 30-40 years, by excluding human uses, and another section of the same peatland that has been disturbed by cattle grazing and Sphagnum moss extraction. Gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) were modeled from NEE, based on measured photosynthetically active radiation and air temperature, separately for each section of the peatland. Uncertainties of the annual flux estimates were assessed from the variability of modelled fluxes induced by applying different time-windows for model development between 10 and 20 days. The undisturbed area of the peatland was on average (+/- SD) a larger net CO2 sink (NEE=-135 +/- 267 gCO(2)m(-2)year(-1)) than the disturbed area (NEE=-33 +/- 111 gCO(2)m(-2)year(-1)). These NEE CO2 balances are small even though GPP and R-eco were larger compared with other peatlands. R-eco had a direct relationship with water table depth (from soil surface) and a negative relationship with soil water fraction. Our results show that the disturbance by moss extraction and cattle grazing is likely to reduce the CO2 sink function of many anthropogenic and natural peatlands on Chiloe Island, which are subjected to the same impacts.

AB Relevance. Mires are simultaneously the indicator of the environment condition, including the river and ground waters connected to mires. It is especial in the area of accommodation of a large drinking water supply system, for example, the Tomsk system of drinking water supply from groundwaters.
   The aim of the research is to reveal the changes of the chemical composition (acid peat extracts) and mineral inclusions as indicators of mire formation conditions according to nature and anthropogenous influence in the peat deposit of the Timilyazevo mire (the western corner of Tomsk city, Western Siberia).
   Methods: methods of definition of chemical and mineral composition of peat and soils, statistical methods.
   Results and conclusions. An uneven change of ash content, Al, Ti, Cr and other elements was revealed with a maximum in the upper and lower layers of the peat deposit in proportion to mineral sources (atmospheric dust and underlying clays, respectively) for mesotrophic Timityazevo mire in the Tom river valley near the Tomsk city. An assumption is made about the presence of a general mechanism for peat formation and the transformation of mineral inclusions in mires based on the environment filtration properties taking into account the previously obtained data for the Vasyugan mire. The main features are the biochemical transformation of mineral substances coming from the atmosphere, or surface and ground flow from drylands. As a result, the substance is in a dissolved, colloidal and suspended form in the active horizon. Mineral phases are formed in the inert horizon. Trace elements co-precipitate on the surface of these particles (also particles of hydroxides) and authigenic minerals including phosphates of rare earth elements are formed. The velocity and direction of these processes depend on the geomorphological and hydrological conditions that determine the emergence and functioning of geochemical barriers.

AB The seasonal and spatial changes of content and composition of dissolved organic carbon in water flowing out from bog were studied. Water was sampled from the Kuke River flowing out from Koigi Bog (eastern Saaremaa, Estonia) and in comparison the water samples from the bog lake (Lake Pitkjarv) were analyzed regularly during 18 months. Absorptions of water samples were measured at 250, 254, 285, 365 and 436 nm on UV-Vis spectrophotometer and pH, conductivity and concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured. Specific ultraviolet absorptions (SUVA) and the ratios of absorptions were calculated to characterize the nature of dissolved organic carbons. The significant changes of the concentration of DOC were determined in water sampled from the Kuke River during the dry days, but it was much steadier during rest sampling time. Analysis of water from the Lake Pitkjarv showed relatively high content of macromolecular organic compounds rich in aromatics (SUVA(254) = 4.58 L mg(-1) m(-1)), whereas water samples from the Kuke River contained predominantly more homogeneous low-molecular-weight materials poor in aromatics (SUVA(254) = 2.96 L mg(-1) m(-1)). Calculated values of SUVA(285) confirmed that organic carbon in river water can be also originated from the decomposition of root litter. The values of ratio of UVA(250)/A(365) for water samples from Kuke River indicated the fulvic nature of DOC as conformed by the SUVA(254) and SUVA(285) values. The values of A(254)/A(436) for river were higher than 14 indicating that the organic matter in water from lake and river contained lots of UV absorbing functional groups. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Climate change has the capacity to alter physical and biological ecosystem processes, jeopardizing the survival of associated species. This is a particular concern in cool, wet northern peatlands that could experience warmer, drier conditions. Here we show that climate, ecosystem processes and food chains combine to influence the population performance of species in British blanket bogs. Our peatland process model accurately predicts water-table depth, which predicts abundance of craneflies (keystone invertebrates), which in turn predicts observed abundances and population persistence of three ecosystem-specialist bird species that feed on craneflies during the breeding season. Climate change projections suggest that falling water tables could cause 56-81% declines in cranefly abundance and, hence, 15-51% reductions in the abundances of these birds by 2051-2080. We conclude that physical (precipitation, temperature and topography), biophysical (evapotranspiration and desiccation of invertebrates) and ecological (food chains) processes combine to determine the distributions and survival of ecosystem-specialist predators.

AB Evaporation from a cutover raised bog in The Netherlands was modelled using a detailed, physically based evaporation model for heterogeneous vegetation and unsaturated soil water how ''SWAPS''. The model enables a quantification of the role of heterogeneity on evaporation. Micro-meteorological measurements above a vegetation of Molinia caerulea (purple moor grass) in the cutover raised bog ''Engbertsdijksvenen'' are used for calibration and validation of the model. In the present study, it is investigated how small scale heterogeneity affects the prediction of evaporation. Therefore, two hypothetical variants, which represent two possible types of small scale heterogeneity in peatlands, are evaluated: (1) peatland in which drainage has resulted in a vegetation cover of 50% purple moor grass and 50% birch, (2) peatland in which after rewetting the vegetation consists of 50% purple moor grass and 50% Sphagnum mosses. The results show that characteristics of the evaporation from purple moor grass in the two variants are dissimilar. The evaporation from purple moor grass, forming the lower components of a vegetation stand (variant I), can be accurately predicted via radiation based models. In case purple moor grass is the exposed part of the vegetation (variant 2), such models are not likely to predict the evaporation from purple moor grass correctly. An exposed, aerodynamically rough vegetation requires a model that accounts for the vapour pressure deficit as well. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Temperate Highland Peat Swamps on Sandstone (THPSS) are upland wetlands, similar to fens in the Northern Hemisphere and are found at the headwaters of low-order streams on the plateaus of Eastern Australia. They are classified as endangered ecological communities under State and National legislation. Previous works have identified particular geomorphic characteristics that are important to carbon storage in these low energy sediment accumulation zones. Changes in the geomorphic structure of THPSS, such as channelisation, may have profound implications for carbon storage. To assess the effect of channelisation on carbon budgets in these ecosystems it is essential to identify and quantify differences in carbon export, emissions and stocks of carbon of intact swamps and those that have become channelised. We undertook seasonal sampling of the perched swamp aquifers and surface waters of two intact swamps and two channelised fills in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia, to investigate differences in carbon exports and emissions between the two swamp types. We found that channelised fills' mean CO2 emissions were almost four times higher than intact swamps with mean CH4 emissions up to five times higher. Annual fluvial carbon exports for channelised fills were up to 18 times that of intact swamps. Channelised fill exports and emissions can represent up to 2% of the total swamp carbon stocks per annum which is 40 times higher than the intact swamps. This work clearly demonstrates that changes in geomorphic structure brought about by incision and channelisation results in profound changes to the carbon storage function of THPSS.

AB In wetlands and lakes, the movement of water is the primary vehicle for inorganic and organic chemical processes. The advective flow of ground water and surface water acts to import and export dissolved and suspended organic and inorganic constituents. Surface and groundwater also mediate inorganic and biochemical reactions. Except for many bogs and other wetlands developed in low-permeability sediments, most wetlands in the midwestern United States in humid climates are in direct contact with active groundwater systems. Wetlands in contact with ground water are ecosystems in which biospheric processes such as evaporation, transpiration, precipitation, and impacts from biological communities interact with physical-hydrogeologic processes to produce a complex array of responses to natural and anthropogenic stresses. Several of these complex responses are displayed in a mid-continental wetland and a northern peatland in North America. The variety of hydrogeologic characteristics present and the processes that operate in wetlands and lakes indicate that site-specific hydrogeologic investigations should be a part of any accurate assessment of an aquatic system.

AB The Kamchatka Peninsula in the far east of Russia is a substantial landmass that is poorly documented in terms of most elements of biodiversity. Here we provide the first study of modern assemblages of testate amoebae, a widespread group of protists that are particularly abundant in soils. We present a data set of 78 widely distributed samples, including forest, fen, scrub and bog habitats. Testate amoebae are abundant and diverse across Kamchatka with 119 taxa identified. The assemblage is primarily composed of widespread taxa, but rarer occurrences such asCyclopyxis puteushint at important biogeographical differences that will require confirmation with molecular data. Assemblages from mineral soils are significantly different from those of peatlands with the former characterized by small idiosome taxa and the latter by larger taxa, often with secretion tests. Water table depth explained significant variance in the peatland samples, supporting the use of testate amoebae in palaeoecological studies. This study adds to our knowledge of the biodiversity of Kamchatka and the global biogeography of protists, and it paves the way for palaeoecological studies to understand long-term environmental change in this region.

AB Inventories of natural assemblages of plant species are critical when planning ecological restoration of bogs. However, little is known about the regional variation in plant communities at the margins (laggs) of bogs, even though they are an integral element of raised bog ecosystems. Therefore, we investigated the regional patterns in the plant communities of bogs and laggs, and the factors that control them, for thirteen bogs in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Species richness was significantly higher in the bogs and laggs of the cooler, wetter Pacific Oceanic wetland region. Beta Diversity analyses showed that bogs in the Pacific Oceanic wetland region often shared species with their respective laggs, whereas half of the laggs in the warmer, drier Pacific Temperate wetland region had no species in common with the adjacent bogs and were thus more ecologically distinct from the bog. Primary climatic variables, such as mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature and latitude, as well as climate-influenced variables, such as pH, peat depth, and Na+ concentrations were the main correlates of plant species composition in the studied bogs. Site-specific factors, particularly depth to water table, and fraction of inorganic material in peat samples, were as strongly related to lagg plant communities as climate, while hydrochemistry appeared to have less influence.

AB The distribution of frost table depths on a peat-covered permafrost slope was examined in a discontinuous permafrost region in northern Canada over 4 consecutive years at a variety of spatial scales, to elucidate the role of active layer development on runoff generation. Frost table depths were highly variable over relatively short distances (0.25-1 m), and the spatial variability was strongly correlated to soil moisture distribution, which was partly influenced by lateral flow converging to frost table depressions. On an interannual basis, thaw rates were temporally correlated to air temperature and the amount of precipitation input. Simple simulations show that lateral subsurface flow is governed by the frost table topography having spatially variable storage that has to be filled before water can spill over to generate flow downslope, in a similar manner that bedrock topography controls subsurface flow. However, unlike the bedrock surface, the frost table is variable with time and strongly influenced by the heat transfer involving water. Therefore, it is important to understand the feedback between thawing and subsurface water flow and to properly represent the feedback in hydrological models of permafrost regions.

AB yThe hydrology of subarctic, discontinuous permafrost regions is sensitive to the effects of climatic warming, because pronounced changes in water storage and runoff pathways could occur with small additional ground heating. The objective of this study is to understand the hydrologic functions of unique land-cover types in this region (channel fens, flat bogs, and peat plateaus) using isotopic and chemical signatures of surface and subsurface water, as well as hydrometric measurements. The study was conducted in a 152-km(2) basin of Scotty Creek, located in the central part of the Mckenzie River basin in northern Canada. The headwater of Scotty Creek, Goose Lake had a strongly enriched isotopic composition due to evaporation. The stream water composition changed downstream, as the lateral drainage from the active layer of peat plateaus contributed isotopically light and chemically dilute water to channel fens that are part of the drainage network. flat bogs received drainage from peat plateau in addition to direct precipitation, and were internally drained or drained water to adjacent channel fens. Average evapotranspiration estimated from the chloride-balance method was 280-300 mm/yr, which was consistent with the hydrometric estimate (precipitation minus runoff) of 275 mm/yr indicating a potential applicability of this method to ungauged basins. Tracer-based hydrograph separation showed that the direct snowmelt contribution to spring runoff was less than half of total discharge, suggesting an importance of the water stored over winter in lakes and wetlands. The total amount of water stored over winter in the basin was estimated to be 140-240 mm, which was comparable to the average annual basin discharge (149 mm). (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Blanket peat covers the headwaters of many major European rivers. Runoff production in upland blanket peat catchments is flashy with large flood peaks and short lag times; there is minimal baseflow. Little is known about the exact processes of infiltration and runoff generation within these upland headwaters. This paper presents results from a set of rainfall simulation experiments performed on the blanket peat moorland of the North Pennines, UK. Rainfall was simulated at low intensities (3-12 mm h(-1)), typical of natural rainfall, on bare and vegetated peat surfaces. Runoff response shows that infiltration rate increases with rainfall intensity; the use of low-intensity rainfall therefore allows a more realistic evaluation of infiltration rates and flow processes than previous studies. Overland flow is shown to be common on both vegetated and bare peat surfaces although surface cover does exert some control. Most runoff is produced within the top few centimetres of the peat and runoff response decreases rapidly with depth. Little vertical percolation takes place to depths greater than 10 cm owing to the saturation of the peat mass. This study provides evidence that the quickflow response of upland blanket peat catchments is a result of saturation-excess overland flow generation. Rainfall-runoff response from small plots varies with season. Following warm, dry weather, rainfall tends to infiltrate more readily into blanket peat, not just initially but to the extent that steady-state surface runoff rates are reduced and more flow takes place within the peat, albeit at shallow depth. Sediment erosion from bare peat plots tends to be supply limited. Seasonal weather conditions may affect this in that after a warm, dry spell, surface desiccation allows sediment erosion to become transport limited. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The genusAulacoseirais cosmopolitan and often abundant in fresh waters. In Costa Rica, freshwater diatom surveys have been restricted to flowing waters, aside from our own explorations. Among sediment samples from some 90 lakes we have encountered an undescribed species which we herein propose to nameAulacoseira umanaiHaberyan sp. nov. In this species, the face of larger valves often bears ridges and tubercles (knobs); separation spines are short (<2.3 mu m) and longer spines are absent. The ringleiste is thick, solid, and very wide. This, in combination with its short collum, distinguishesA. umanaifrom many other species of the genus.Aulacoseira umanaiis abundant in the surficial sediments of multiple glacial lakes that are over 3450 m in elevation on Cerro Chirripo; it is also abundant in glacial-age deposits in La Chonta bog (2310 m a.s.l.). It seems to have evolved from an ancestor that resembledA. alpigena; the locality of this event is unknown but was likely to have been a high-altitude lake in the Central American isthmus.

AB We present the first testate amoeba-based palaeohydrological reconstruction from the Swiss Alps, and the first depth to the water table (DWT) calibration dataset for this region. Compared to existing models, Our new calibration dataset performs well (RMSEP=4.88), despite the length of the water table gradient covered (53 cm). The present-day topography and vegetation of the study mire Mauntschas suggest that it is partly ombrotrophic (large Sphagnum fuscum hummocks, one of which was the coring site) but mostly under the minerotrophic influence of springs in the mire and runoff from the surrounding area. Ombrotrophic Sphagnum fuscum hummocks developed at the sampling site only during the last 50 years, when testate amoebae indicate a shift towards dry and/or acid conditions. Prior to AD 1950 the water table was much higher, suggesting that the influence of the mineral-rich water prevented the development of ombrotrophic hummocks. The reconstructed DWT correlated with Pinus cembra pollen accumulation rates, suggesting that testate amoebae living on the mire and P. cembra growing Outside of it partly respond to the salve factor(s). Finally, temperature trends from the nearby meteorological station paralleled trends in reconstructed DWT. However, contrary to other studies made on raised bogs of northwestern Europe, the highest correlation was observed for winter temperature, despite the fact that testate amoebae would more logically respond to moisture conditions during the growing season. The observed correlation with winter temperature might reflect a control of winter severity on surface moisture during at least the first part of the growing season, through snow melt and soil frost phenomena influencing run-Off. More ecohydrological work on subalpine mires is needed to understand the relationships between climate, testate amoebae and peatland development. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from peatlands implies a loss of sequestered carbon. During the last two decades, an increase of DOC exports in Europe and North America has been reported. The influence of land use on DOC has been contradictorily discussed and a lack of knowledge exists particularly for fens in Northeastern Germany. Therefore, we aimed to investigate DOC release from fen soils with differing land use intensity. To exclude climatic influences and water level fluctuations, a lysimeter study was performed. The lysimeter vessels contained three histosols from Northeastern Germany and varied in peat quantity, substrate quality, water table depth, pH and vegetation, as these factors are strongly influenced by land use intensity. Water for DOC analysis was sampled biweekly over a two year period. DOC release ranged from 4 to 123 mg/L-1 with a median of 32 +/- 22 mg/L-1. Lowest DOC concentrations were found at deeply drained gleysols and at relatively slightly decomposed, acidic histosols. Highest concentrations were measured in the most degraded histosols. Degree of decomposition and pH were found to be the major driving factors for DOC release. Long-lasting rewetted lysimeters were not observed to release a lower amount of DOC than drained ones, which may be of importance when restoration of degraded peatlands is intended. As lysimeters from the same site released relatively similar amounts of DOC despite their varying management during the last 50 years, it appears that peatlands have an individual potential for DOC release.

AB Riparian lowlands act as interfaces between the streams and upland areas. This study identified and quantified local flow paths in four transects of a 26 ha Danish riparian lowland in a glacial till landscape. The riparian lowland was fed by drain water from the upland agricultural drainage catchments. Precipitation, stream stage, and drainage discharge into the riparian lowland were measured continuously, while groundwater hydraulic heads were measured in piezometer pipes twice per month. A water balance model was developed to quantify water fluxes leaving the riparian lowland area via evapotranspiration, leakage to a deeper aquifer, and via groundwater flow, drain flow, and overland flow to the adjacent stream. Overland flow originating from the tile drains was the main flow path in all four transects, and also fluxes to the stream via groundwater or lowland tile drains were significant in some subareas. The presence of a secondary tile drainage network within parts of the riparian lowland reduced overland flow and increased interaction with the riparian lowland soils. Area-normalized fluxes varied greatly between transects, largely reflecting variations in hydraulic loading rate (ratio of water input rate to the area of the receiving riparian lowland). This, combined with the significance of groundwater flow and riparian lowland tile drain flow in some of the investigated transects, revealed a heterogeneous distribution of flow paths within the small headwater lowland. The rate of overland flow was highly correlated to the hydraulic loading rate, which in turn was dominated by the drainage discharge rate at the hillslope boundary.
   Key Points
   Overland flow, bypassing the riparian lowland, is produced when the hydraulic loading exceeds riparian lowland infiltration Magnitudes of overland flow are correlated with the ratio of catchment area to riparian lowland area Riparian lowland drains reduce overland flow and increase water residence times

AB In the Alpine mountains, mire systems are found in the form of small, scattered landscape units. Nevertheless, they maintain noticeably high diversity in terms of plant specialists and community types. A unique, species-rich example in the central Pyrenees, Bassa Nera, is analysed here by describing the major gradients that drive species composition and their relationship with abiotic drivers. We studied the specific vegetation composition, water chemistry and seasonal dynamics of the water table at 35 sampling points. The floristic data confirmed the uniqueness of Bassa Nera in relation to similar Pyrenean mire systems, both in terms of total species richness and regionally rare mire specialists. We distinguished seven plant community types and identified the depth to the water table as the principal driver of the variation in species composition. The water chemistry determined smaller composition shifts, since variations in pH and cationic contents were moderate. Flooded areas were species poor whereas soligenous sub-alkaline fens supported the highest numbers of species. However, the harshest mire habitats (floating Sphagnum carpets and Sphagnum hummocks) stood out as they included the highest number of rare plants within relatively species-poor assemblages. Therefore, the high species richness and uniqueness of the Bassa Nera system mirrors a combination of a wide range of hydrological conditions and a moderate variation in water chemistry. This case study reveals how a few mire systems stand out as exceptional sites. Thus, in Alpine ranges a thorough survey on mire vegetation is needed to select and effectively protect these threatened relict ecosystems.

AB Mine reclamation requires the reconstruction of entire landforms and drainage systems. The hydrological regime of reclaimed landscapes will be a manifestation of the processes operating within the individual landforms that comprise it. Hydrology is the most important process regulating wetland function and development, via strong controls on chemical and biotic processes. Accordingly, this research addresses the growing and immediate need to understand the hydrological processes that operate within reconstructed landscapes following resource extraction. In this study, the function of a constructed fenwatershed the Nikanotee Fen watershed) is evaluated for the first two years following construction 2013-2014) and is assessed and discussed within the context of the construction-level design. The system design was capable of sustaining wet conditions within the Nikanotee Fen during the snow-free period in 2013 and 2014, with persistent ponded water in some areas. Evapotranspiration dominated the water fluxes from the system. These losses were partially offset by groundwater discharge from the upland aquifer, which demonstrated strong hydrologic connectivity with the fen in spite of most construction materials having lower than targeted saturated hydraulic conductivities. However, the variable surface infiltration rates and thick placement of a soil-capping layer constrained recharge to the upland aquifer, which remained below designed water contents in much of the upland. These findings indicate that it is possible to engineer the landscape to accommodate the hydrological functions of a fen peatland following surface oil sands extraction. Future research priorities should include understanding the storage and release of waterwithin coarse-grained reclaimed landforms as well as evaluating the relative importance of external water sources and internal water conservation mechanisms for the viability of fen ecosystems over the longer-term.

AB On patterned peatlands, open water pools develop within a matrix of terrestrial vegetation ('ridges'). Regional patterns in the distribution of ridge-pool complexes suggest that the relative cover of these two surface types is controlled in part by climate wetness, but landscape topography must also be an important controlling factor. In this paper, a functional model that relates relative cover of ridges and pools to climate and surface gradient was developed and tested. The model was formulated in terms of a water budget, based on the differential effects of ridges and pools on losses by evapotranspiration and subsurface flow. It predicts a positive relationship between surface gradient and ridge proportion, with a linear effect related to water supply and ridge hydraulic conductivity, modified at high ridge proportion by differences in evapotranspiration between ridges and pools. The limit to patterned peatland distribution occurs where the surface is completely covered by ridges. The model may be sensitive or insensitive to climate differences between localities, depending on whether hydraulic characteristics of ridge peat co-vary with water supply. To distinguish between these alternative hypotheses, surface gradient and ridge proportion were surveyed along 20 transects in each of three localities in Scotland that differ threefold in net precipitation to pools. The results of the field survey served to reject the climate-sensitive hypothesis, but were consistent with the climate-insensitive hypothesis. Analysis of the residuals suggested that variation within localities was related more to topographic control of water supply than to ridge hydraulic conductivity or developmental stage. Hence, within this maritime climate region, the distribution of ridge-pool complexes and the relative abundance of pools are controlled mainly by topographic variables. Field surveys across both maritime and continental regions are required to confirm a subtle climatic effect that allows pools to occur on higher gradients in drier climates than in wetter climates. Further development and testing of the functional model will provide a stronger basis for assessing potential feedback between climate change, peatland surface structure and methane emission from pools.

AB The differences in the air temperature, precipitation, evaporation, and relative humidity between wetlands and nonwetlands were analyzed to investigate the effects of alpine wetlands on regional climate. Meanwhile, the changes in precipitation and surface runoff fluxes before and after the typical wetland degradation were discussed, and the effects of wetland degradation on soil organic carbon were assessed. Correlation and regression analyses were applied to exhibit the relationships between wetland landscape areas and meteorological factors. Our results showed that the cooling effects of wetlands on ambient environment were very obvious, and soil temperature could be higher in the area with less surrounding wetland area. The evaporation capacity and relative humidity in wetlands were higher compared to the surrounding non-wetlands. Precipitation and surface runoff flux decreased due to serious wetland degradation, indicating that wetland degradation or expansion had close relation with regional precipitation. Once peat soils were converted to meadow soils or Aeolian sandy soils, soil organic carbon (SOC) would decline linearly. Correlation and regression analyses showed that there were significant correlations between wetland landscape areas and the annual average air temperature, the average air temperature in growing seasons, and the evaporation in growing seasons (P < 0.05).

AB Fog deposition on to a blanket bog near Cape Race, Newfoundland, was measured with a fog collector and a lysimeter. Fog is most frequently produced by warm southwesterly air flow over cold offshore water, although cooler northeasterly air is also important. Between 21 June and 14 July 1989 fog deposition was 50% of rainfall, averaging 1.8 mm day-1, with a maximum daily deposition of 10.2 mm. Evaporation was also restricted during fog and rain events; evaporation on days with fog or rain averaged < 1.1 mm, compared with 2.5 mm when it was not foggy or raining. The addition of water to the surface by fog, combined with low evaporation rates may be critical to the development of blanket bog in this area.

AB In this study, the ecosys model was used to simulate the hydrology of the Met Bleue bog, Ontario, Canada, with seasonally varying water tables in the upper 1 m. The soilprofile was divided into three zones of peat (fibric, hemic, and sapric). In the model, large, readily drained macropore fractions in the fibric peat caused low water-holding capacity and high infiltration rates, in contrast to hemic and sapric peat, with small macropore fractions, high water-holding capacities, and low infiltration rates. Model results for peat water contents, theta, and water table depths, Z, were tested with continuous hourly measurements from 2000 to 2004 using time domain reflectometry, probes and piezometers. Within the zone of pronounced water table variation, the theta and Z modeled with the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for macropore flow and Richards' equation for peat matrix flow corresponded better to the measured theta and Z (regression slopes between 0.62 and 1.03, intercepts between -0.05 and 0.02 m(3) m(-3), and R(2) between 0.40 and 0.56), than did the modeled theta and Z with Richards' equation alone (regression slopes between 0.33 and 1.43, intercepts between 0.11 and 0.22 m(3) m(-3), and R(2) between 0.27 and 0.41). The Richards equation done, even when parameterized with extremely high or low bulk saturated hydraulic conductivities of fibric pear, modeled slower infiltration, greater water retention, and lower Z than measured. The implications of macropore flow might be of great importance for peatland hydrology, therefore this experimental and modeling work should be extended to other wetlands as well.

AB Considerations and analyses of the consequences of climate change on hydrological processes focus on projections and predictions of the future runoff behaviour, potential risk of flooding, and groundwater recharge. Nature conservationists have tried both at national and regional levels to predict - mainly from changes in air temperature - shifts in species ranges and derive the extinction risks of species from their temperature preferences (CHMIELEWSKI et al. 2005, POMPE et al. 2009). Much less attention was granted to the site as an aggregate of all abiotic factors influencing vegetation. However, it must be presumed that climate change will alter - next to temperature - other site factors as well; in the first instance the water balance at the site (HERBST & HORMANN 1998). Fens, like all other water-influenced biotopes, depend in their emergence, distribution, form, and their ecological valuation closely on the regional and local water balance. That is why one expects that climate change will profoundly influence these habitats and their species communities (IPCC 2001). Because of their adaptation to a certain water-balance regime under a specific combination of the factors temperature", precipitation", and evaporation", plants are particularly vulnerable by climate change (DAWSON et al. 2003). This paper uses modelled water-balance scenarios of two nature reserves in Baden-Wuerttemberg, the alder-carr "Erlenbruch Lichteler Landturm" and the fen "Birkenweiher" to examine how climate changes may affect the water balance, the site characteristics, and the vegetation.

AB Open ditch drainage has historically been a common land management practice in upland blanket peats, particularly in the UK. However, peatland drainage is now generally considered to have adverse effects on the upland environment, including increased peak flows. As a result, drain blocking has become a common management strategy in the UK over recent years, although there is only anecdotal evidence to suggest that this might decrease peak flows. The change in the hydrological regime associated with the drainage of blanket peat and the subsequent blocking of drains is poorly understood, therefore a new physics-based model has been developed that allows the exploration of the associated hydrological processes. A series of simulations is used to explore the response of intact, drained and blocked drain sites at field scales. While drainage is generally found to increase peak flows, the effect of drain blocking appears to be dependent on local conditions, sometimes decreasing and sometimes increasing peak flows. Based on insights from these simulations we identify steep smooth drains as those that would experience the greatest reduction in field-scale peak flows if blocked and recommend that future targeted field studies should be focused on examining surface runoff characteristics.

AB Understanding the ecohydrological responses of peatlands to climate change is particularly challenging over the late Holocene owing to the confounding influence of anthropogenic activity. To address this, a core spanning the last similar to 2400 years from a raised bog in northern England was analysed using a comprehensive suite of proxy methods in an attempt to elucidate the drivers of change. A testate amoebae-based transfer function was used to quantitatively reconstruct changes in water table depth, supported by humification analysis and a plant macrofossil-derived hydroclimatic index. Pollen and plant macrofossil data were used to examine regional and local vegetation change, and human impacts were inferred from charcoal and geochemistry. Chronological control was achieved through a Bayesian age-depth model based on AMS radiocarbon dates and spheroidal carbonaceous particles, from which peat and carbon accumulation rates were calculated. Phases of both increased and decreased bog surface wetness (inferred effective precipitation) are present, with dry phases at c. AD 320-830, AD 920-1190 and AD 1850 present, and a marked period of increased effective precipitation at c. AD 1460-1850. Coherence with other records from across Northern Europe suggests that these episodes are primarily driven by allogenic climatic change. Periods of high bog surface wetness correspond to the Wolf, Sporer and Maunder sunspot activity minima, suggesting solar forcing was a significant driver of climate change over the last similar to 1000 years. Following the intensification of agriculture and industry over the last two centuries, the combined climatic and anthropogenic forcing effects become increasingly difficult to separate due to increases in atmospheric deposition of anthropogenically derived pollutants, fertilising compounds, and additions of wind-blown soil dust. We illustrate the need for multiproxy approaches based on high-resolution palaeoecology and geochemistry to examine the recent trajectories of peatlands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the pore pressure behaviour observed within peat beneath a newly constructed railway embankment. Piezometers installed at different depths beneath the structure showed episodic increases in pore pressure above hydrostatic pressure followed by a rapid pore pressure decrease. It was postulated that this fluctuation in pore pressure was due to the movement and expulsion of gases within the peat. Investigations were conducted in the laboratory to replicate this pore pressure response. The peat specimens were subjected to isotropic consolidation, within a triaxial cell, at constant confining pressure while measuring the change in the specimen's pore pressure and volume. The results of this investigation indicate that the gas bubbles move through the channeled network of voids towards the drainage boundary where they restrict the flow of water, which results in the increase of pore pressure towards an upper limit or escape pressure, ultimately causing an expulsion of gas bubbles. This expulsion of bubbles results in a rapid drop in pore pressure and volume change within the specimen. The implications of the volume change associated with this pore pressure behaviour are discussed.

AB Fens belong to the most threatened ecosystems in Europe. Maintaining a high water table through rewetting is an effective measure to rehabilitate many of their ecosystem functions. However, the impact of meteorological conditions such as vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and precipitation on water tables is still unclear for rewetted fens. Here, we compare the impact of meteorological factors on water table dynamics in a drained and a rewetted fen, using multiple regression with data from continuous high-resolution (temporal) water level monitoring and weather stations. We find that an increase in the daily mean VPD causes a higher drop in the water table at the drained and degraded fen compared to the rewetted fen. Precipitation contributes to recharge, causing the water table to rise higher at the drained site than at the rewetted site. We attribute the differential influence of meteorological conditions on water table dynamics to different soil specific yield values (i.e., water storage capacity) largely driven by lower water table position at the drained site. Our study underlines the importance of understanding how and why water tables in peatlands vary in response to meteorological factors for management decisions (e.g., rewetting). Continuous monitoring of water table and vegetation development in rewetted fen peatlands is advisable to ensure long-term success especially under climate change conditions and associated drought events.

DE Sydney Basin; Tonsteins; coal formation; peat; lowered mire
AB The Late Permian Newcastle Coal Measures of the northern Sydney Basin, Australia, contain numerous volcanic ash deposits occurring as both interseam tuffs and intraseam tonsteins. These tuffaceous units have been used to correlate seams of the Newcastle Coal Measures with the stratigraphically equivalent Wollombi Coal Measures in the adjacent Hunter Coalfield. Such correlations across the width of the northern Sydney Basin are based not on only tufflaceous markers, but also on chemical and maceral profiles within individual coal plies and carbonaceous shales. These correlations imply a lateral continuity of the peat-forming environment previously unrecognised in the Sydney Basin, and have led directly to the discovery of a new open-cut coal resource in the Hunter Coalfield. The uniform distribution of tonsteins and coal plies also challenges many existing concepts of peat formation. It is proposed that the peat surface was predominantly below the water table, and the term "lowered mire" is proposed to describe this environment. A subaqueous peat surface would protect thin volcanic ash deposits from subsequent redistribution by rainfall and surface runoff, and is consistent with a lack of tree preservation within the intraseam tonsteins. It is envisaged that trees were generally restricted to the peat margins, and to specific horizons where the peat surface was exposed by a fall in the water table. Long-distance correlations of tonstems also contradict models of coal formation incorporating lateral peat migration, where time constant horizons such as tonsteins should transgress the coal seam profile over large distances.

AB Water table depth (WTD) effects on net ecosystem CO2 exchange of boreal peatlands are largely mediated by hydrological effects on peat biogeochemistry and the eco-physiology of peatland vegetation. The lack of representation of these effects in carbon models currently limits our predictive capacity for changes in boreal peatland carbon deposits under potential future drier and warmer climates. We examined whether a process-level coupling of a prognostic WTD with (1) oxygen transport, which controls energy yields from microbial and root oxidation-reduction reactions, and (2) vascular and nonvascular plant water relations could explain mechanisms that control variations in net CO2 exchange of a boreal fen under contrasting WTD conditions, i.e., shallow vs. deep WTD. Such coupling of eco-hydrology and biogeochemistry algorithms in a process-based ecosystem model, ecosys, was tested against net ecosystem CO2 exchange measurements in a western Canadian boreal fen peatland over a period of drier-weather-driven gradual WTD drawdown. A May-October WTD drawdown of similar to 0.25m from 2004 to 2009 hastened oxygen transport to microbial and root surfaces, enabling greater microbial and root energy yields and peat and litter decomposition, which raised modeled ecosystem respiration (R-e) by 0.26 mu mol CO2 m(-2)s(-1) per 0.1m of WTD drawdown. It also augmented nutrient mineralization, and hence root nutrient availability and uptake, which resulted in improved leaf nutrient (nitrogen) status that facilitated carboxylation and raised modeled vascular gross primary productivity (GPP) and plant growth. The increase in modeled vascular GPP exceeded declines in modeled nonvascular (moss) GPP due to greater shading from increased vascular plant growth and moss drying from near-surface peat desiccation, thereby causing a net increase in modeled growing season GPP by 0.39 mu mol CO2 m(-2)s(-1) per 0.1m of WTD drawdown. Similar increases in GPP and Re caused no significant WTD effects on modeled seasonal and interannual variations in net ecosystem productivity (NEP). These modeled trends were corroborated well by eddy covariance measured hourly net CO2 fluxes (modeled vs. measured: R-2 similar to 0.8, slopes similar to 1 +/- 0.1, intercepts similar to 0: 05 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)), hourly measured automated chamber net CO2 fluxes (modeled vs. measured: R-2 similar to 0: 7, slopes similar to 1 +/- 0.1, intercepts similar to 0.4 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)), and other biometric and laboratory measurements. Modeled drainage as an analog for WTD drawdown induced by climate-change-driven drying showed that this boreal peatland would switch from a large carbon sink (NEP similar to 160 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) to carbon neutrality (NEP similar to 10 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) should the water table deepen by a further similar to 0.5 m. This decline in projected NEP indicated that a further WTD drawdown at this fen would eventually lead to a decline in GPP due to water limitation. Therefore, representing the effects of interactions among hydrology, biogeochemistry and plant physiological ecology on ecosystem carbon, water, and nutrient cycling in global carbon models would improve our predictive capacity for changes in boreal peatland carbon sequestration under changing climates.

AB Entrapped biogenic gas in peat can greatly affect peatland biogeochemical and hydrological processes by altering volumetric water content, peat buoyancy, and 'saturated' hydraulic conductivity, and by generating over-pressure zones. These over-pressure zones further affect hydraulic gradients which influence water and nutrient flow direction and rate. The dynamics of entrapped gas are of global interest because the loss of this gas to the atmosphere via ebullition (bubbling) is likely the dominant transport mechanism of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere from peatlands, which are the largest natural terrestrial source per annum of atmospheric CH4. We investigated the relationship between atmospheric pressure and temperature on volumetric gas content (VGC) and CH4 ebullition using a laboratory peat core incubation experiment.
   Peat cores were incubated at three temperatures (one core at 4 degrees C, three cores at 11 degrees C, and one core at 20 degrees C in sealed PVC cylinders, instrumented to measure VGC, pore-water CH4 concentrations, and ebullition (volume and CH4 concentrations). Ebullition events primarily occurred (71% of the time) during periods of falling atmospheric pressure. The duration of the drop in atmospheric pressure had a larger control on ebullition volume than the magnitude of the drop. VGC in the 20 degrees C core increased from the onset of the experiment and reached a fluctuating but time-averaged constant level between experiment day 30 and 115. The chance in VGC was low for the 11 degrees C cores for the initial period of the experiment but showed large increases when the growth chamber temperature increased to 20 degrees C due to a malfunction. The core maintained at 4 degrees C showed only a small increase in entrapped gas content throughout the experiment. The 20 degrees C core showed the largest increase in VGC. The increases in VGC occurred despite pore-water concentrations of CH4 being below the equilibrium solubility level. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Internal water storage and water exchanges that sustain hydration are critical for the physiological function of Sphagnum mosses that have recolonized cutover peatlands characterized by low soil-water pressures. The relative importance of water gains and losses for spontaneously regenerated Sphagnum moss cushions was addressed through investigation of the sensitivity of moss moisture dynamics to a range of environmental variables. Precipitation waters are poorly retained within the cushions, which indicated that rain event water can only be relied upon by the mosses for a short period. The relationship between water table depth and moisture content within moss cushions was strong when the water table was within 30cm of the surface of the cutover peat but weakened as conditions became drier, as reflected by weakened upward hydraulic gradients in the unsaturated zone below the moss cushions. Calculation of a water budget between 19 May and 16 August 2006 for relatively wet and dry cushions, respectively, identified a water deficit of 28 and 44mm. It is hypothesized that additional (small) sources of water during deficit conditions may be critical for maintaining physiological processes. Rewetting of the peatland by blocking drainage ditches created conditions more favourable for Sphagnum survival through increasing the moisture content and soil-water pressures within the remnant peat deposit although restoration efforts should aim to constrain the water table position to within the upper 30cm.

TI THE RIVER HAS NEVER DIVIDED US: BRONZE AGE METALWORK DEPOSITION IN
   WESTERN BRITAIN
SO OXFORD JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The significant quantities of Bronze Age metalwork recovered from the River Thames have focused archaeological attention on the presence of metalwork from riverine locations and led to the expectation that rivers should contain metalwork. Finds from bogs and marshes have also been considered to be part of this practice of deposition in wet places. Whilst rivers and bogs can indeed be thought of as wet, this overlooks the fundamental physical and cosmological differences between these two types of wetland. This paper will consider Bronze Age metalwork finds from rivers in the west of Britain, paying particular attention to Britain's longest river, the Severn. The finds will be compared to those from bogs and marshes, and an attempt will be made to explain these differences in terms of the opposing metaphorical qualities of flowing and standing water, and the landscapes in which these wet places are located.

TI Carbon Dioxide and Methane Flux Response and Recovery From Drought in a

SO FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE

DT Article
DE drought; blanket bog (peatland); carbon; methane; CO2; greenhouse gas;
   climate change
AB Globally peatlands store 500 Gt carbon (C), with northern blanket bogs accumulating 23 g C m(-2) y(-1) due to cool wet conditions. As a sink of carbon dioxide (CO2) peat bogs slow anthropogenic climate change, but warming climate increases the likelihood of drought which may reduce net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and increase soil respiration, tipping C sinks to sources. High water tables make bogs a globally important source of methane (CH4), another greenhouse gas (GHG) with a global warming potential (GWP) 34 times that of CO2. Warming may increase CH4 emissions, but drying may cause a reduction. Predicted species composition changes may also influence GHG balance, due to different traits such as erenchyma, e.g., Eriophorum vaginatum (eriophorum) and non-aerenchymatous species, e.g., Calluna vulgaris (heather). To understand how these ecosystems will respond to climate change, it is vital to measure GHG responses to drought at the species level. An automated chamber system, SkyLine2D, measured NEE and CH4 fluxes near-continuously from an ombrotrophic fen from August 2017 to September 2019. Four ecotypes were identified: sphagnum (Sphagnum spp), eriophorum, heather and water, hypothesizing that fluxes would significantly differ between ecotypes. The 2018 drought allowed comparison of fluxes between drought and non-drought years (May to September), and their recovery the following year. Methane emissions differed between ecotypes (p < 0.02), ordered high to low: eriophorum > sphagnum > water > heather, ranging from 23 to 8 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1). Daily NEE was similar between ecotypes (p > 0.7), but under 2018 drought conditions all ecotypes were greater sources of CO2 compared to 2019, losing 1.14 g and 0.24 g CO2-C m(-2) d(-1) respectively (p < 0.001). CH4 emissions were ca. 40% higher during 2018 than 2019, 17 mg compared to 12 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) (p < 0.0001), and fluxes exhibited hysteresis with water table depth. A lag of 84-88 days was observed between rising water table and increased CH4 emissions. A significant interaction between ecotype and year showed fluxes from open water did not return to pre-drought levels. Our findings suggest that short-term drought may lead to a net increase in C emissions from northern wetlands.

TI A Simple Method for Simulating Groundwater Interactions with Fens to
   Forecast Development Effects
SO GROUNDWATER
LA English
DT Article
ID FLOW; WATER; HYDROLOGY; RECHARGE; LAKE
AB Protection of fens-wetlands dependent on groundwater discharge-requires characterization of groundwater sources and stresses. Because instrumentation and numerical modeling of fens is labor intensive, easy-to-apply methods that model fen distribution and their vulnerability to development are desirable. Here we demonstrate that fen areas can be simulated using existing steady-state MODFLOW models when the unsaturated zone flow (UZF) package is included. In cells where the water table is near land surface, the UZF package calculates a head difference and scaled conductance at these "seepage drain" cells to generate average rates of vertical seepage to the land. This formulation, which represents an alternative to blanketing the MODFLOW domain with drains, requires very little input from the user because unsaturated flow-routing is inactive and results are primarily driven by easily obtained topographic information. Like the drain approach, it has the advantage that the distribution of seepage areas is not predetermined by the modeler, but rather emerges from simulated heads. Beyond the drain approach, it takes account of intracell land surface variation to explicitly quantify multiple surficial flows corresponding to infiltration, rejected recharge, recharge and land-surface seepage. Application of the method to a basin in southeastern Wisconsin demonstrates how it can be used as a decision-support tool to first, reproduce fen distribution and, second, forecast drawdown and reduced seepage at fens in response to shallow pumping.

AB The elemental composition and spectroscopic properties of dissolved fulvic acids isolated from different sampling media (topsoil, ground and surface water) of a natural fen area (high portion of organic soils) were examined to reveal the effects of land use history. These effects need to be known if dissolved humic substances are to be a major factor in identifying the impact of present and future changes in land use. Dissolved fulvic acids (topsoil, groundwater) from highly degraded peatlands (due to a long-term agricultural use) exhibit lower C/N ratios, higher absorption in the UV spectra, and higher absorption at 1,620 cm(-1) in the FTIR spectra compared with fulvic acids from relatively intact peatlands. These properties illustrate that long-term agricultural use with high inputs results in increased aromatic structures and a further humification of dissolved fulvic acids due to very strong peat decomposition compared with relatively intact peatlands. Synchronous fluorescence spectra also indicate the higher level of aromatic structures within fulvic acids isolated from sites with long-term agricultural use (high peat decomposition) compared with a land use history resulting in a lower peat decomposition. The different sources of fulvic acids in surface water (precipitation, runoff, interflow, groundwater) are the main reason for these effects not being detected in fulvic acids isolated from surface water. Short-term changes in land use characterized by a transition from crop farming to an unimproved grassland were found not to affect the spectroscopic properties of dissolved fulvic acids. A humification index deduced from the synchronous fluorescence spectra is proposed. We have strong evidence that dissolved humic substances indicate changes in the environmental conditions (both anthropogenic and natural) of wetlands with a high proportion of organic soils.

AB Peatlands in discontinuous permafrost regions occur as a mosaic of wetland types, each with variable sensitivity to climate change. Permafrost thaw further increases the spatial heterogeneity in ecosystem structure and function in peatlands. Carbon (C) fluxes are well characterized in end-member thaw stages such as fully intact or fully thawed permafrost but remain unconstrained for transitional stages that cover a significant area of thawing peatlands. Furthermore, changes in the environmental correlates of C fluxes, due to thaw, are not well described - a requirement for modeling future changes to C storage of permafrost peatlands. We investigated C fluxes and their correlates in end-member and a number of transitional thaw stages in a sub-arctic peatland. Across peatland-lumped CH4 and CO2 flux data had significant correlations with expected correlates such as water table depth, thaw depth, temperature, photosynthetically active radiation and vascular green area. Within individual thaw states, bivariate correlations as well as multiple regressions between C flux and environmental factors changed variably with increasing thaw. The variability in directions and magnitudes of correlates reflects the range of structural conditions that could be present along a thaw gradient. These structural changes correspond to changes in C flux controls, such as temperature and moisture, and their interactions. Temperature sensitivity of CH4 increased with increasing thaw in bivariate analyses, but lack of this trend in multiple regression analyses suggested cofounding effects of substrate or water limitation on the apparent temperature sensitivity. Our results emphasize the importance of incorporating transitional stages of thaw in landscape level C budgets and highlight that end-member or adjacent thaw stages do not adequately describe the variability in structure-function relationships present along a thaw gradient.

AB Understanding the climatic and biological factors that regulate soil carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux is crucial in peatlands because they contain a large proportion of terrestrial carbon (C). We predicted that rainfall reduction would increase soil CO2 efflux, and that cessation of below-ground allocation of recent plant assimilate would reduce soil CO2 efflux. These predictions were tested in the field using rainfall shelters that allowed a maximum of 40 % of rainfall onto 2 x 2 m plots by diverting rainwater from the shelter roofs with guttering, and by girdling stems of the dominant plant, Calluna vulgaris, for two years. We also used (CO2)-C-13-pulse labelling of intact monoliths at ambient CO2 concentrations to trace recent assimilate from plant shoots to roots, bulk soil, leachate, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and soil CO2 efflux. Soil CO2 efflux in the sheltered plots increased in Year 1 but not in Year 2, and we found a positive relationship between soil CO2 efflux and water table depth. Our data indicate that lowering the water table below a critical threshold (15-20 cm) affects soil CO2 efflux. Girdling of C. vulgaris shoots resulted in no measurable reduction in soil CO2 efflux, while only similar to 3 % of C-13 fixed by shoots was recovered in soil CO2 efflux and DOC in the 20 days after labelling. Our findings show that below-ground allocation of recent assimilate from C. vulgaris plants > 6 years old has little impact on soil CO2 efflux.

AB Testate amoebae are sensitive indicators of substrate moisture in peatlands. Over the last decades, they have been studied to reconstruct hydrological changes since the Holocene. However, these studies have been geographically restricted to North America and Europe. We conducted the first investigation of testate amoebae on the largest continental fresh water wetland in the Sanjiang Plain, China. The objectives of this study were to provide baseline data on the ecology of testate amoebae in the peatlands of Northeast China and to assess the potential of using them as environmental indicators in this ecosystem. We examined modern testate amoeba assemblages and species-environmental relationships at 46 microsites within 5 waterlogged depressions. The environmental parameters measured included: depth to water table, pH, and loss on ignition. The results showed that the dominant species were Trinema complanatum type, Euglypha rotunda type, Euglypha strigosa type, and Centropyxis cassis type. Redundancy analysis demonstrates that water table depth has the most important effect on testate amoeba assemblages, explaining 16.7% (p = 0.002) of the total variance. pH was not a statistically significant factor for testate amoeba assemblages. Weighted averaging and weighted averaging partial least squares models were used to build transfer functions for depth to water table. The best performing transfer function was generated by the weighted averaging partial least squares model with an r (2) (LOSO) of 0.62 and RMSEPLOSO of 6.96 cm. Results indicate that testate amoebae in waterlogged depression peatland have the potential to be used as indicators for hydrological changes and for palaeohydrologic reconstructions in the Sanjiang Plain.

AB This study compared the energy budget components of latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H), net radiation (Rn) and ground heat flux (G) between an undisturbed bog and an adjacent abandoned peatland pasture within the same peatland complex in western Newfoundland, Canada. The analysis was based on the period of April 2014 to August 2015 when measurements were concurrent at both sites, thus encompassing two growing seasons. The overall objective was to identify the impact of agricultural management and abandonment on peatland energy flux and partitioning. LE and H showed strong seasonal patterns for both sites. LE, which was higher at the pasture, peaked near the middle of the growing season. H at the bog was smaller than that at the pasture during the early growing season, but became larger during the middle and late growing seasons, with the maximum H occurring during the early growing season. G was the smallest flux in the energy budget at both sites, and it showed no obvious temporal pattern at either site. The variation in daytime average evapo-transpiration (ET) was related to net radiation and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) at both sites. However, it was more strongly related to Rn. ET at the pasture site exhibited greater sensitivity to changes in Rn and VPD. Daytime ET increased and decreased with water table depth (WTD) when WTD was above and below a threshold of -0.24 m at the bog and -0.46 m at the pasture. The between-site differences in growing season H and LE (Delta H and Delta LE) were mainly caused by their different vegetation conditions, and Delta H and Delta LE were negatively and positively related to Delta EVI (difference in enhanced vegetation index), respectively.

AB [1] In mires, which occupy large areas of the boreal region, net ecosystem CO2 exchange ( NEE) rates vary significantly over various timescales. In order to examine the effect of one of the most influencing variables, the water table depth, on NEE the general ecosystem model GUESS-ROMUL was modified to predict mire daily CO2 exchange rates. A simulation was conducted for a lawn, the most common microtopographical feature of boreal oligotrophic minerotrophic mires. The results were validated against eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements from Degero Stormyr, northern Sweden, obtained during the period 2001 - 2003. Both measurements and model simulations revealed that CO2 uptake was clearly controlled by interactions between water table depth and temperature. Maximum uptake occurred when the water table level was between 10 and 20 cm and the air temperature was above 15 degrees C. When the water table was higher, the CO2 uptake rate was lower, owing to reduced rates of photosynthetic carbon fixation. When the water table was lower, NEE decreased owing to the increased rate of decomposition of organic matter. When the water table level was between 10 and 20 cm, the NEE was quite stable and relatively insensitive to both changes within this range and any air temperature changes above + 15 degrees C. The optimal water table level range for NEE corresponds to that characteristic of mire lawn plant communities, indicating that the annual NEE will not change dramatically if climatic conditions remain within the optimal range for the current plant community.

TI SURFACE LEVEL AND WATER-TABLE FLUCTUATIONS IN A SUB-ARCTIC FEN
SO ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID EVAPORATION; PEATLAND; WETLAND
AB Fluctuations in the surface level of a subarctic fen, near Schefferville, Quebec, were measured from early June to mid-August 1988. Surface level, water table, and depth of thaw were measured at four sites representing three different topographic units of the fen: a flat central area; hummocks, islands and ridges; and the fen perimeter. Surface level changes of several centimeters a day were measured in the central portion of the fen, while the change was much less in the ridge and perimeter areas. Change in surface level at the perimeter and ridge sites was controlled by the depth of thaw. Levels of the central area were controlled by changes in water storage. A simple water balance model adequately predicted the lowering of the surface level of the central area of the fen. However, the same model underestimated rising surface levels. The adjusting surface level in the central area of the fen lead to a constantly saturated peat surface even during periods of persistent exfiltration. The constancy of saturation has important implications on the rate and magnitude of many biotic and abiotic processes, such as the biogenic production and consumption of trace gases and evapotranspiration.

AB The relevance of the work is due to insufficient observational data on small watercourses required for climate change monitoring, dangerous hydrological phenomena forecast, culvert installations calculation and efficient exploitation of micro-hydro power plants.
   The main aim of the study: to justify the choice of optimum methods of automated water runoff accounting and hydrological and climate information collecting for modeling the dynamics of water-balance elements, as well as, to ensure an adaptive land management and the needs of hydrological and geochemical monitoring.
   The methods used in the study. Of all the elements of water balance it is the surface water runoff that is most accurately measured, reflecting the current active layer moisture on a small watershed. Instruments (designed and manufactured at the Institute of Monitoring of Climatic and Ecological Systems of SB RAS) for the automatic monitoring of water level, of soil, water and air temperatures were established on three small catchments in the diverse climatic conditions. Model watersheds are located in a zone of oligotrophic swamps of southern taiga, in a zone of frost mound bog of forest tundra and mountain zone of southern taiga. Various methods of hydraulic calculations were used for water runoff account: the first one for free over fall round in section broadcrested weir, the second one for uniform motion in natural channels, the third one for the triangular weir with partial drowned downstream. To determine the surface roughness of a certain water flow the measurements of the flow were performed by means of a hydrometric method (current meter) or a volumetric method for low water discharge. The measurements of a level and other meteorological parameters were carried out with an interval of 1:00 and were saved in the control unit.

AB In three Scandinavian peatlands we studied to what extent plant and microbial community compositions are governed by local-scale microhabitat, with a special interest in the effect of aspect (i.e. exposition of slopes). Despite differences in solar irradiance between the south- and north-facing slopes, maximum temperature was elevated in the south-facing slopes at the most northern site only. Pore-water nutrient concentrations were not affected by aspect, yet dissolved organic carbon concentrations were higher in the south-facing microhabitats. This was likely caused by higher vascular plant biomass. Plant and microbial community composition clearly differed among sites. In all three sites, microhabitat (i.e. prevailing water-table depth) affected the plant and microbial community compositions. Aspect, however, did not affect community composition, even though microclimate significantly differed between the south- and the north-facing aspects at the northernmost site. Our results highlight the complex link between plant community composition, microbial community and environmental conditions, which deserves much more attention than currently in order to fully understand the effects of climate change on peatland ecosystem function.

AB A limited number of publications in the literature address the measurement of actual evapotranspiration (AET) from peat soils. AET is an important parameter in the description of water pathways of an ecosystem. In peatlands, where the water table is near the surface, the measurement of AET represents a challenge. This paper discusses the development of an automated lysimeter installed between July 12 and 27, 2010, at an 11-ha bog site, Pont-Rouge (42km west of Quebec City, Canada). This system was made of an isolated block of peat, maintained at the same water level as the surrounding water table by a system of submersible pressure transmitters and pumps. The change in water level in millimeters in the isolated block of peat was used to calculate the water lost through evapotranspiration while for accounting the precipitation. The rates of AET were calculated for each day of the study period. This relatively inexpensive and simple to install system may eventually be used to calculate AET on peaty soils in the years to come.

AB Sphagnum mosses contribute to the long-term carbon sequestration of many northern peatlands. Variability in both Sphagnum and peatland CO2 exchange is strongly influenced by water availability, but there is limited work examining the links between these relationships, particularly in a field setting. In this study, the effects of varying moss water content (WC), through precipitation exclusion (PE) and water addition (WA) treatments, on net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and component fluxes were assessed during a single growing season at Mer Bleue bog, a temperate ombrotrophic peatland. CO2 exchange by Sphagnum, vascular plants, and the total ecosystem were measured in situ using chambers. On average, the hummock species of Sphagnum dominant at the site maintained WCs within the optimal range for photosynthesis in all treatments and no treatment effect on CO2 exchange was observed. However, in a few samples associated with below optimal WCs, Sphagnum photosynthesis was reduced. Water table (WT) depth and direct precipitation were both important controls on Sphagnum WC, suggesting that frequent small rain events may be important in maintaining Sphagnum WC. This study only explored one variable associated with drought conditions (i.e. water availability through intercepted precipitation). Consequently, further study is necessary to assess the relative importance of deep WT positions and high temperatures on moss WC. Nevertheless, the results of this study suggest that decreased Sphagnum photosynthesis has the potential to influence peatland CO2 uptake at Mer Bleue in drought years, but only if moss WC is reduced below the optimal range.

AB Historically, northern peatlands have functioned as a carbon sink, sequestering large amounts of soil organic carbon, mainly due to low decomposition in cold, largely waterlogged soils(1,2). The water table, an essential determinant of soil-organic-carbon dynamics(3-10), interacts with soil organic carbon. Because of the high water-holding capacity of peat and its low hydraulic conductivity, accumulation of soil organic carbon raises the water table, which lowers decomposition rates of soil organic carbon in a positive feedback loop. This two-way interaction between hydrology and biogeochemistry has been noted(3,5-8), but is not reproduced in process-based simulations(9). Here we present simulations with a coupled physical-biogeochemical soil model with peat depths that are continuously updated from the dynamic balance of soil organic carbon. Our model reproduces dynamics of shallow and deep peatlands in northern Manitoba, Canada, on both short and longer timescales. We find that the feedback between the water table and peat depth increases the sensitivity of peat decomposition to temperature, and intensifies the loss of soil organic carbon in a changing climate. In our long-term simulation, an experimental warming of 4 degrees C causes a 40% loss of soil organic carbon from the shallow peat and 86% from the deep peat. We conclude that peatlands will quickly respond to the expected warming in this century by losing labile soil organic carbon during dry periods.

AB Drained peatlands are hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which could be mitigated by rewetting and land use change. We performed an ecological/economic analysis of rewetting drained fertile peatlands in a hemiboreal climate using different land use strategies over 80 years. Vegetation, soil processes, and total GHG emissions were modeled using the CoupModel for four scenarios: (1) business as usualNorway spruce with average soil water table of -40 cm; (2) willow with groundwater at -20 cm; (3) reed canary grass with groundwater at -10 cm; and (4) a fully rewetted peatland. The predictions were based on previous model calibrations with several high-resolution datasets consisting of water, heat, carbon, and nitrogen cycling. Spruce growth was calibrated by tree-ring data that extended the time period covered. The GHG balance of four scenarios, including vegetation and soil, were 4.7, 7.1, 9.1, and 6.2 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. The total soil emissions (including litter and peat respiration CO2 + N2O + CH4) were 33.1, 19.3, 15.3, and 11.0 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1), respectively, of which the peat loss contributed 35%, 24%, and 7% of the soil emissions for the three drained scenarios, respectively. No peat was lost for the wet peatland. It was also found that draining increases vegetation growth, but not as drastically as peat respiration does. The cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is sensitive to time frame, discount rate, and carbon price. Our results indicate that the net benefit was greater with a somewhat higher soil water table and when the peatland was vegetated with willow and reed canary grass (Scenarios 2 and 3). We conclude that saving peat and avoiding methane release using fairly wet conditions can significantly reduce GHG emissions, and that this strategy should be considered for land use planning and policy-making.

AB The melting of high-latitude permafrost peatlands is a major concern due to a potential positive feedback on global climate change. We examine the ecology of testate amoebae in permafrost peatlands, based on sites in Sweden (similar to 200 km north of the Arctic Circle). Multivariate statistical analysis confirms that water-table depth and moisture content are the dominant controls on the distribution of testate amoebae, corroborating the results from studies in mid-latitude peatlands. We present a new testate amoeba-based water table transfer function and thoroughly test it for the effects of spatial autocorrelation, clustered sampling design and uneven sampling gradients. We find that the transfer function has good predictive power; the best-performing model is based on tolerance-downweighted weighted averaging with inverse deshrinking (performance statistics with leave-one-out cross validation: R-2 = 0.87, RMSEP = 5.25 cm). The new transfer function was applied to a short core from Stordalen mire, and reveals a major shift in peatland ecohydrology coincident with the onset of the Little Ice Age (c. AD 1400). We also applied the model to an independent contemporary dataset from Stordalen and find that it outperforms predictions based on other published transfer functions. The new transfer function will enable palaeohydrological reconstruction from permafrost peatlands in Northern Europe, thereby permitting greatly improved understanding of the long-term ecohydrological dynamics of these important carbon stores as well as their responses to recent climate change.

AB Northern peatlands store nearly one-third of terrestrial carbon (C) stocks while covering only 3% of the global landmass; nevertheless, the drivers of C cycling in these often-waterlogged ecosystems are different from those that control C dynamics in upland forested soils. To explore how multiple abiotic and biotic characteristics of bogs interact to shape microbial activity in a northern, forested bog, we added a labile C tracer (C-13-labeled starch) to in situ peat mesocosms and correlated heterotrophic respiration with natural variation in several microbial predictor variables, such as enzyme activity and microbial biomass, as well as with a suite of abiotic variables and proximity to vascular plants aboveground. We found that peat moisture content was positively correlated with respiration and microbial activity, even when moisture levels exceeded total saturation, suggesting that access to organic matter substrates in drier environments may be limiting for microbial activity. Proximity to black spruce trees decreased total and labile heterotrophic respiration. This negative relationship may reflect the influence of tree evapotranspiration and peat shading effects; i.e., microbial activity may decline as peat dries and cools near trees. Here, we isolated the response of heterotrophic respiration to explore the variation in, and interactions among, multiple abiotic and biotic drivers that influence microbial activity. This approach allowed us to reveal the relative influence of individual drivers on C respiration in these globally important C sinks.

AB There is growing interest in the restoration of blanket bogs that were afforested during the 1960s to 1980s, to avoid further loss of carbon to the atmosphere and to regain and defragment important blanket bog habitat. This paper reports the findings from a ten-year experiment in the UK to test the effectiveness of restoration treatments on water table depth, peat bulk density and water content, ground surface height and vegetation development. Treatments used were the six combinations of damming or not damming plough furrows with leaving the trees alive, felling and leaving them on the ground or felling and removing them. Combining felling with damming furrows was most successful in raising the water table, whether or not the felled trees were removed. Only where felling was combined with damming did the water table continue to recover between Years 5 and 10. Over ten years, the water level in these treatments rose to slightly below that of non-afforested reference bog at the same sites. This occurred as a rapid initial rise, following which there was only very slight further improvement. Felling caused the species composition of the vegetation to change towards that of the reference bogs. The process was slow, with the vegetation becoming more dissimilar to non-forested reference bog in the first five years and then becoming more similar to the reference bog after Year 5. Surprisingly, damming plough furrows had little effect on the vegetation except that, in combination with felling, it increased differentiation between the plough furrows and other positions on the ploughed ground. Conifer seedlings established on the restored plots, most densely where they adjoined standing forest, and had similar density and growth in all the felled treatments. The restoration treatments resulted in a decrease in bulk density and increase in water content of the upper peat, probably due to an unloading effect caused by the raised water table buoying up the drained peat layer. In some treatments this was amplified by removal of the weight of the trees. Damming the plough furrows caused a 5-7 cm rise in ground surface height, suggesting that subsidence resulting from primary consolidation and secondary compression is at least partly reversible.

AB Sphagnum-dominated peatlands are major carbon pools and sinks, but these functions are threatened by climate change. There is, therefore, a need to better understand how microclimatic changes (soil temperature, soil moisture and water table depth) are affecting their functioning. Experimental studies on Sphagnum peatlands conducted under precisely controlled (e.g. mesocosm) conditions are relatively rare, especially those aiming to understand the system as a whole. Furthermore, mesocosm designs are generally described only briefly in the literature. In this article we provide a comprehensive account of a mesocosm experiment designed to study the response of Sphagnum peatlands to water table manipulation. We describe our experimental setup (3 water levels x 3 amplitudes of water table fluctuation x 5 replicates); and explain how we built the mesocosms, the issues we faced and the solutions we chose to solve them. We provide a detailed description of the devices we conceived to manipulate the water level, including software codes and electronic diagrams (as supplementary material), and explain how to address data loss in such an experimental design. We show that it is possible to build a reliable and powerful experimental setup at moderate cost using standard technology. The aim of this article is to provide a useful resource for researchers wishing to design similar experiments in the future.

AB We examined the influence of water table position, temperature, vegetation, and CH4 storage on CH4 flux at 22 wetland sites located in the zone of discontinuous permafrost, near Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories. Sites ranged from frozen peat plateaux and palsas with collapse scars to fens and bogs and ponds. Mean summer CH4 emissions ranged from -1.3 to 255 mg m(-2) d(-1), and the variation among sites was best explained by mean water table position (r(2) = 0.62, n = 19). Large CH4 fluxes (>30 mg m(-2) d(-1)) and high water tables occurred in ponds and graminoid sites, whereas small fluxes (<30 mg m(-2) d(-1)) and low water tables occur in shrub and woody sites. These relationships were upheld across several northern boreal regions, based on water table depth and broad ecological criteria. CH4 turnover times were generated by comparing surficial fluxes and storage within the saturated portion of the peat profile. Graminoid sites had CH4 turnover times from 1 to 4 days, whereas shrub or woody sites had longer turnover times, ranging from weeks to years. We estimated an overall flux of similar to 18 mg m(-2) d(-1) for the landscape around Fort Simpson. This CH4 flux may increase with the onset of global warming, owing to the fragility of permafrost, resulting in the formation of collapse scars with high CH4 emission rates.

AB Testate amoebae are common proxies of past hydrological conditions in peatlands and are increasingly used as indicators of ecosystems ecological integrity. The ecology of these microorganisms is relatively well documented in non-forested ombrotrophic peatlands but there is a lack of data from forested peatlands, which are important ecosystems in boreal regions. This study provides the first testate amoebae modem training set (n = 72) from forested peatlands of the James Bay lowlands, eastern Canada. The relationships between testate amoeba communities and environmental variables (pH, water table depth, canopy openness, mineral particles concentration) were investigated using canonical correspondence analyses. Our data have shown that testate amoebae are sensitive environmental indicators in forested peatlands and can be used to reconstruct past hydrological conditions for these environments. A transfer function for water table depth (WTD) reconstructions was developed using weighted averaging models and was tested on a fossil testate amoebae record. In comparing forested and non-forested peatlands datasets we have shown that testate amoebae occupy similar ecological niches with respect to surface wetness in both ecosystems, but that their WTD optima is much higher (drier) in forested peatlands. The results show that the diversity and composition of testate amoeba assemblages do not vary significantly at the microform scale. This study provides new knowledge on testate amoebae ecology in forested peatlands that will improve further transfer function development in peatland ecosystems. This will allow a better evaluation of the responses of boreal forested peatlands to climate change, ecological disturbances and human activities.

AB The south-eastern part of the Bohemian Massif (the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands, the Trebon basin, Czech Republic) is an important hotspot of fen biodiversity. Especially rich fens with calcium-tolerant peat mosses (the Sphagno warnstoifii-Tomentypnion alliance) currently harbour highly endangered organisms. In this study we gathered phytosociological and environmental (water chemistry, water table depth) data from 57 unique and well-preserved fens. The ISOPAM algorithm reproduced the expert-based classification at the alliance level presented in the Vegetation of the Czech Republic monograph. Particular types of vegetation were nearly completely differentiated in the PCA of environmental data and all their pairs differed significantly with respect to pH, which together with calcium was correlated with the major vegetation gradient. The secondary gradient coincided with the concentration of nitrate and potassium, but was not apparent in the bryophyte subset. When only data for vascular plants were analyzed, the major gradient reflected increasing number of species from poor to extremely-rich fens, including ubiquitous grassland species, and only partially coincided with pH and calcium. Contrary to expectations, neither the extremely rich or rich fens were associated with low concentration phosphorus in the water. In addition, particular vegetation types did not differ in the N:P ratio of bryophyte biomass. Species composition of extremely rich fens thus seemed to be determined predominantly by a high pH/calcium level and waterlogging, low iron concentration and absence of sphagna that would hamper regeneration of some competitively weak vascular plants. We demonstrated that the delimitation of the major vegetation types (alliances) along the poor-rich gradient makes great floristic and ecological sense also in the Hercynian Mountains and that pH and calcium rather than nutrient availability differentiate causally major vegetation types by determining structure of the moss layer.

AB Peatland areas provide a range of ecosystem services, including biodiversity, carbon storage, clean water, and flood mitigation, but many areas of peatland in the UK have been degraded through human land use including drainage. Here, we explore whether remote sensing can be used to monitor peatland resilience to drought. We take resilience to mean the rate at which a system recovers from perturbation; here measured literally as a recovery timescale of a soil surface moisture proxy from drought lowering. Our objectives were (1) to assess the reliability of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter as a proxy for water table depth (WTD); (2) to develop a method using SAR to estimate below-ground (hydrological) resilience of peatlands; and (3) to apply the developed method to different sites and consider the links between resilience and land management. Our inferences of WTD from Sentinel-1 SAR data gave results with an average Pearson's correlation of 0.77 when compared to measured WTD values. The 2018 summer drought was used to assess resilience across three different UK peatland areas (Dartmoor, the Peak District, and the Flow Country) by considering the timescale of the soil moisture proxy recovery. Results show clear areas of lower resilience within all three study sites, which often correspond to areas of high drainage and may be particularly vulnerable to increasing drought severity/events under climate change. This method is applicable to monitoring peatland resilience elsewhere over larger scales, and could be used to target restoration work towards the most vulnerable areas. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Carbon isotopic composition of Sphagnum macrofossils can potentially he used as a palaeohydrological tool for peat-based climatic studies since a relationship between Sphagnum delta C-13 Values and peatland Surface moisture has been presented in previous Studies. In order to verify this hypothesis, modern Sphagnum delta C-13 values were measured along a moisture (microtopographic) gradient in two boreal peat bogs, Isotopic measurements were performed oil bulk material of S. fuscum, S. magellanicum, S. capillifolium and S. pulchrum. Isotopic variations found within and between Sphagnum species along the microtopographic gradient were compared using analysis Journal of Quaternary Science of variance. A significant Positive Correlation (P < 0.0001) was found between Sphagnum delta C-13 Values and their position along the Surface moisture gradient. Results show that C-13-depleted values are related to low water table depths (WTD), while C-13-enriched values correspond to a water table that is close to the peat surface. Although the mechanisms underlying carbon fractionation processes in mosses are not Well understood, we demonstrate that water resistance to CO2 diffusion is an important fractionation process that is observed in bulk Sphagnum delta C-13 measurements, since drier and wetter samples exhibit consistent and very different isotopic signatures.

AB In regions with a distinct winter-period, nearly half of the annual runoff occurs during a short snow-melt period early in spring. During this time functioning buffer zones are important means of preventing the leaching of phosphorus from forest land into downstream watercourses. Sparse vegetation restricts biological P accumulation and high flows reduce the capacity of deeper soil layers to adsorb P, indicating that the effectiveness of buffer zones may be low. Our aim was to increase the understanding of phosphorus retention in a buffer zone area under such unfavourable conditions for P removal, and to estimate the amount of P sorbed by soil and taken up by vascular plants and mosses. Over a five-day period in spring we added 10 kg (60 kg ha(-1)) of PO(4)-P and 185 MBq (1100 MBq ha(-1)) (32)P to a 25-50 m wide buffer zone area (0.17 ha) in southern Finland. We measured the total P retention and recovery during ten days after the beginning of the experiment. Recovery of (32)P was 16% of added P, of which 90% was in soil, 3% in vascular plants and 5% in mosses. Thus, our results showed that the total P retention was low, most likely because the water flow did not slow down sufficiently and penetrate deeply enough to enable a close contact between P in the runoff and the soil matrix. Most of the recovered P was in the soil suggesting that adsorption by soil was the most important sink for P under early spring high flow conditions.

AB The dynamic pattern of soil water transport is a major factor in determining the chemistry of streamwater. In the acidified Birkenes catchment (southernmost Norway) the streamwater chemistry is, to a first approximation, explained by mixing solutions from the forest floor, the B horizon and the deep peat, in various proportions depending on the hydrological conditions. Paradoxically, a direct physical contact between the forest floor and the B horizon on the one hand and the stream on the other is lacking, as the stream banks largely consist of peats. To investigate this paradox, soils and their levels of exchangeable cations were studied in a 100 m x 100 m grid. Results indicate that the exchange sites of the surface peat along the stream are significantly enriched in Al, probably due to return flow of Al-rich B horizon water. This view is supported by the similarity of the solution chemistry in surface peats and B horizons. Exchangeable base cations dominate in the forest floor upslope. Forest floor solutions, an important component of streamwater during intensive storms, are depleted in Al and may bypass the Al-enriched surface peats via ephemeral flow channels. A parallel study in a pristine catchment in mid-Norway shows a similar accumulation of Al in return flow areas. This indicates that acid deposition is not a prerequisite for elevated levels of exchangeable Al in the surface organic layers of return flow areas.

AB Boreal peatlands may be vulnerable to projected changes in the wildfire regime under future climates. Extreme drying during the sensitive postfire period may exceed peatland ecohydrological resilience, triggering long-term degradation of these globally significant carbon stocks. Despite these concerns, we show low peatland evapotranspiration at both the plot- and landscape-scale postfire, in water-limited peatlands dominated by feather moss that are ubiquitous across continental western Canada. Low postfire evapotranspiration enhances the resilience of carbon stocks in such peatlands to wildfire disturbance and reinforces their function as a regional source of water. Near-surface water repellency may provide an important, previously unexplored, regulator of peatland evapotranspiration that can induce low evapotranspiration in the initial postfire years by restricting the supply of water to the peat surface.

AB Although temporal and spatial variations in peatland methane (CH4) emissions at broad scales are often related to water table (WT) using a linear relationship, a potentially complex relationship exists between these variables locally and over shorter time scales. To explore this issue, CH4 fluxes were measured using eddy covariance at the Mer Bleue bog over two summer seasons. Peak CH4 emissions (30 to 50 mg CH4-C m-2 d-1) occurred not when the WT was closest to the surface but instead, when it dropped to 40 to 55 cm below the surface. When the WT was below or above this zone, average fluxes were similar to 14 mg CH4-C m-2 d-1. We speculate this critical zone coincides with the necessary redox potentials and sources of fresh organic material that lead to maximum production of CH4 and/or with conditions that lead to degassing of stored CH4. However, as expected, total summer CH4 emissions were 47% lower during the drier year. This occurred in part because the WT was within the critical zone for fewer days in the drier year but also because after an extended midsummer dry period there was little recovery of CH4 emissions, even a month after rewetting.

AB The vegetation, environment, and ecological gradients present on three calcareous mires in the South Park valley, Park County, Colorado, were investigated. Vegetation was classified into four habitat classes, nine subclasses, and twelve species associations using two-way species indicator analysis (TWINSPAN). Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was used to ordinate vegetation samples along two axes representing the three predominant ecological gradients: water table height, miremargin to expanse, and region. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to directly relate local environmental conditions to vegetation. Water table depth, microtopographical development, soil and water pH and nutrient level, soil organic matter, and hydraulic head were significantly correlated with vegetation gradients. The mire soils consist of intermixed areas of organic and mineral soils. Mire soils and water are highly alkaline and nutrient-rich. Mean pore water calcium concentration on these mires is 115 mg/L, electrical conductivity averages 575 muS, and mean pH is 7.4. Owing to these conditions, the fen floras include a number of highly minerophilic species. Based on water chemistry and species criteria, each site was classified as rich to extremely rich fen, with the two fen types mixing in complex patterns according to local environmental conditions. The species Trichophorum pumilum, Salix candida, Salix myrtillifolia, Carex microglochin, Carex viridula, Carex scirpoidea, Eriophorum gracile, Triglochin maritimum, Triglochin palustris, Kobresia myosuroides, Kobresia simpliciuscula, Thalictrum alpinum, Scorpidium scorpioides, Scorpidium turgescens, and Calliergon trifarium were determined to be indicative of extremely rich fen conditions in the southern Rocky Mountains.

AB The turnover of radioactive caesium was studied experimentally and theoretically in a forested catchment that was covered by snow during the wet deposition of radioactive nuclides from the Chernobyl accident. The study spans from 1 week before to 8 years after the deposition event. A fraction of the catchment is covered by a mire (16%). From the edge of the mire a stream channel runs to the outlet of the catchment. Two phases of decreasing activity concentration in the stream water were found in addition to a positive influence of runoff on the activity concentration in the stream. The half-lives for Cs-137 in the stream water corresponding to the early and the later phase were estimated by non-linear regression to be 6.5 days and 4 years, respectively. During the first phase, which corresponded to the initial snow melt in 1986, 6.8% of the deposition was lost from the catchment, whereas the slow secondary loss during the following 8 years was 1.8%. The main contribution to the yearly discharge of Cs-137 occurred during spring and autumn when the areal contribution to saturated surface runoff was highest. The remaining deposition in soil a few years after the fallout was significantly lower in the mire than in the surrounding forest. By using the calculated activity concentration of Cs-137 in the stream water together with the remaining deposition in the different biotopes and information on stream flow for the catchment it was concluded that the loss originated from the mire. During the initial phase 44% of the deposition was lost from the mire, and during the following years the yearly loss was 30% from the fraction that constantly undergoes saturated surface runoff and 2% from the drier fractions of the mire. Until the end of the study it was not possible to demonstrate any loss from the recharge areas (podzol and cambisol soils), which means that physical decay will govern the decrease in activity in these areas.

AB Mountain fens are limited in their spatial extent but are vital ecosystems for biodiversity, habitat, and carbon and water cycling. Studies of fen hydrological function in northern regions indicate the timing and magnitude of runoff is variable, with atmospheric and environmental conditions playing key roles in runoff production. How the complex ecohydrological processes of mountain fens that govern water storage and release as well as peat accumulation will respond to a warmer and less snowy future climate is unclear. To provide insight, we studied the hydrological processes and function of Sibbald fen, located at the low end of the known elevation range in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, over a dry period. We added an evapotranspiration function to the Spence hydrological function method to better account for storage loss. When frozen in spring and early summer, the fen primarily transmits water. When thawed, the fen's hydrological function switches from water transmission to water release, leading to a summertime water table decline of nearly 1 m. Rainfall events larger than 5 mm can transiently switch fen hydrological function to storage, followed by contribution, depending on antecedent conditions. The evapotranspiration function was dominant only for a brief period in late June and early July when rainfall was low and the ground was still partially frozen, even though evapotranspiration accounted for the largest loss of storage from the system. This research highlights the mechanisms by which mountain peatlands supply baseflow during drought conditions, and the importance of frozen ground and rainfall in regulating their hydrological function. The study has important implications for the sustainability of low elevation mountain fens under climate change.

AB The importance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) for the organic, Fe and P reductions achieved in an overland flow area (OFA) was estimated and the changes in the nature of DOM studied by gel filtration at a site in northern Finland. In the OFAs peat mining water is purified conducting it across a natural mire of a given size. DOM plays an important role in the transport and reduction of organic matter, Fe and P in OFAs. The retention of Fe in filtrates, dissolved organic P and to some extent also DOM in the OFA under low flow conditions in summer is probably promoted by the high Fe content of the highest apparent molecular (HAMW) weight DOM in the peat mining water. On the other hand, the originally low Fe content of the DOM in the HAMW fraction may be one reason for the generally low reductions in these water quality parameters achieved during flood periods.

AB Peatland ecosystems have been consistent carbon (C) sinks for millennia, but it has been predicted that exposure to warmer temperatures and drier conditions associated with climate change will shift the balance between ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration providing a positive feedback to atmospheric CO2 concentration. Our main objective was to determine the sensitivity of ecosystem photosynthesis, respiration and net ecosystem production (NEP) measured by eddy covariance, to variation in temperature and water table depth associated with interannual shifts in weather during 2004-2009. Our study was conducted in a moderately rich treed fen, the most abundant peatland type in western Canada, in a region (northern Alberta) where peatland ecosystems are a significant landscape component. During the study, the average growing season (May-October) water depth declined approximately 38 cm, and temperature [expressed as cumulative growing degree days (GDD, March-October)] varied approximately 370 GDD. Contrary to previous predictions, both ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration showed similar increases in response to warmer and drier conditions. The ecosystem remained a strong net sink for CO2 with an average NEP (+/- SD) of 189 +/- 47 g C m-2 yr-1. The current net CO2 uptake rates were much higher than C accumulation in peat determined from analyses of the relationship between peat age and cumulative C stock. The balance between C addition to, and total loss from, the top 0-30 cm depth (peat age range 0-70 years) of shallow peat cores averaged 43 +/- 12 g C m-2 yr-1. The apparent long-term average rate of net C accumulation in basal peat samples was 19-24 g C m-2 yr-1. The difference between current rates of net C uptake and historical rates of peat accumulation is likely a result of vegetation succession and recent increases in tree establishment and productivity.

AB Aims This study assesses the relative effects of hydrology and colonization by vascular plants on belowground C and N mobilization, and emission of CO2 and CH4 in an extracted bog under restoration in Alberta (Canada). Methods A wet (high water table) and dry (low water table) area were identified at the site and plots with cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum) or bare peat were established in each area. Plant growth, peat and porewater dissolved C (DOC) and N (TDN), microbial biomass and the emissions of CO2 and CH4 were monitored at the plots throughout the growing season. Results The largest concentrations of DOC were measured in dry and bare sites. Lower E2:E3 ratios suggested a higher aromaticity of the DOC at these sites that were net sources of CO2 and CH4. The concentration of TDN was greater in plots with cottongrass and high water table, supporting a more abundant microbial biomass. Cottongrass dominated plots also had larger gas emissions as compared to bare plots even though they were net C sinks due to their high photosynthetic rates. Conclusion Maintaining a high water table is key to reducing peatland C losses. While vascular plant presence seems to prime the release of N and greenhouse gases, the inputs of C exceeded the losses and recovered the C sink function of the peatland ecosystem in the short term. Carbon inputs are maximized under high water table and plant presence.

AB Study Focus: This research examines a wetland environment before and after the construction of a beaver dam to determine the hydrologic impacts on regional groundwater flow and quantify changes to the capture zone of a wetland pond. Increased hydraulic head behind a newly built beaver dam can cause shifts in the capture zone of a wetland pond. Changes in groundwater flux, and the extent of both the capture and discharge zones of this wetland were examined with the use of a groundwater flow model, created using MODFLOW.
   New hydrological insights for the region: The construction of a beaver dam resulted in minimal changes to regional groundwater flow paths at this site, which is attributed to a clay unit underlying the peat, disconnecting this wetland from regional groundwater flow. However, groundwater discharge from the wetland pond increased by 90%. Simulating a scenario with the numerical model in which the wetland is connected to regional groundwater flow results in a much larger impact on flow paths. In the absence of the clay layer, the simulated construction of a beaver dam causes a 70% increase in groundwater discharge from the wetland pond and increases the surface area of both the capture zone and the discharge zone by 30% and 80%, respectively.

AB This study was conducted to assess the nitrogen removal potential of a minerotrophic peatland in Northern Germany, where hydrological conditions were partly restored in the beginning of the 1990s. Actual denitrification and the effect of nitrate (NO3-) and glucose additions on denitrification rates were determined in two flooded and one drained histosols in spring and summer 1998. In the flooded soils, denitrification was insignificant, but the drained field emitted significant rates. Additions of NO3- stimulated denitrification at all sites in spring and summer, whereas glucose additions had no effect. Low NO3- concentration in floodwater was obviously limiting denitrification in the flooded soils. In the drained soil, a coupled nitrification/denitrification might explain the low, but significant denitrification rates. No spontaneous production of nitrous oxide occurred in the flooded soils, whereas at the drained site an increase in spontaneous nitrous oxide concentration was measured during incubation in the summer samples. The suggested introduction of NO3- rich water from a stream flowing through the area would apparently induce denitrification in the flooded fields.

AB Ecosystem respiration (R (eco) ) is controlled by thermal and hydrologic regimes, but their relative importance in defining the CO2 emissions in peatlands seems to be site specific. The aim of the paper is to investigate the sensitivity of R (eco) to variations in temperature and water table depth (WTD) in a wet, geogenous temperate peatland with a wide variety of vegetation community groups.
   The CO2 fluxes were measured using chambers. Measurements were made at four microsites with different vegetation communities and peat moisture and temperature conditions every 3 to 4 weeks during the period 2008-2009, 2 years with contrasting WTD patterns. Models were used to examine the relative response of each microsite to variations in peat temperature and WTD and used to estimate annual total R (eco) .
   Temporal variations in R (eco) were strongly related to peat temperature at the 5 cm depth. However, two of the microsites did not show any significant change in this relationship while two others showed contrasting responses including an increase and decrease in temperature sensitivity with deeper WTD. Average R (eco) varied among the microsites and tended to be greatest for those with greatest leaf area which also positively correlated with deeper WTD, ash content and degree of peat decomposition at 20 cm. A combined temperature and WTD model explained up to 94 % of the temporal variation in daily average R (eco) and was used to show that on an annual basis, R (eco) was between 5 and 18 % greater in the warmer year with deeper WTD.
   Microsite-specific responses were related to differences in vegetation and peat characteristics among microsites. R (eco) may have remained insensitive to WTD variations at one microsite due to the dominance of autotrophic respiration from abundant sedge biomass. At a Sphagnum-dominated microsite, a lack of response may have been due to relatively small variations in WTD that did not greatly influence microbial respiration or due to offsets between decreasing and increasing respiration rates in near-surface and deeper peat. The microsite with the most recalcitrant peat had reduced R (eco) sensitivity to temperature under more aerobic conditions while another microsite showed the opposite response, perhaps due to less nutrient availability during the wet year. Ultimately, micro-site specific models with both soil temperature and WTD as explanatory variables described temporal variations in R (eco) and highlighted the significant spatial variations in respiration rates that may occur within a single wetland.

AB The transport of Th, Ra, and Pb-210 from a continental source region and through an estuarine environment was investigated. Unlike previous studies, here both short- and long-lived nuclide data were obtained for river inputs, river water, and estuarine waters. The mire-rich Kalix River drainage basin was chosen as a typical northern shield area because this river may represent typical waters flowing into the Arctic and northern seas.
   Groundwaters from bedrock and glacial tills have comparable Th isotope concentrations and do not exhibit significant Th isotopic shifts relative to host rocks. The extensive peat deposits of the basin receive groundwater discharges and concentrate Th and U (but not Ba and Ra), which cause high Th-230/Th-232 ratios in mire waters. However, mire outflows do not have a significant impact on Th and Ra isotopic compositions of the river.
   Overall weathering characteristics for the basin are obtained from the river data. The Th-230/Th-232, Ra-228/Ra-226, and Ra-226/Ba river ratios are comparable to those of source rocks, consistent with similar release rates of these nuclides from U-, Th-, and Ba-bearing minerals. River ratios of (Th-230/U-238)(AR) and (Ra-226/U-238)(AR) are <1, so that Th and possibly Ra are accumulating in the weathering regions, and the weathering profile is still evolving. Low (Ra-228/Th-232)(AR) and (Ra-226/Th-230)(AR) ratios indicate that Th is preferentially retained over Ra. River (Th-234/U-238)(AR) ratios are greater than (Th-230/U-238)(AR) ratios and suggest that in systems where river inputs are well characterized, these ratios can be used to calculate Th transit times through the watershed. Filtration data indicate that although a dominant fraction of the Th is transported in the river on particles, the rest is almost entirely carried by colloids.
   The Kalix River discharges into the Baltic Sea. Model calculations for the transport of Th and Ra isotopes in the Baltic Sea show that the high ratios of (Th-234/U-238)(AR) found here reflect long Th residence times relative to particle scavenging of similar to 50 d. The water column Th-232 budget is dominated by eolian inputs. The Ra-226 concentrations may be higher than those of water inflows, with less than or equal to 60% derived from underlying sediments. A greater fraction of Ra-228 is derived from sediments to balance the decay of Ra-228 within the water column during the 35-yr residence time of water in the Baltic. The Baltic (Ra-228/Ra-226)(AR) ratios, which are relatively constant over a range of salinities, are fortuitously similar to those of the river inflows. Copyright (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Nitrogen and phosphorus were added experimentally in a bog in the southern Alps. It was hypothesized that alleviating nutrient limitation will increase vascular plant cover. As a consequence, more carbon will be fixed through higher rates of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE).
   The vascular cover did increase at the expense of Sphagnum mosses. However, such vegetation changes were largely independent of the treatment and were probably triggered by an exceptional heatwave in summer 2003.
   Contrary to the tested hypothesis, NEE was unaffected by the nutrient treatments but was strongly influenced by temperature and water-table depth. In particular, ecosystem respiration in the hot summer of 2003 increased dramatically, presumably owing to enhanced heterotrophic respiration in an increased oxic peat layer.
   At the end of the experiment, the Sphagnum cover decreased significantly in the nitrogen-fertilized treatment at hummock microhabitats. In the long term, this will imply a proportionally greater accumulation of vascular litter, more easily decomposable than the recalcitrant Sphagnum litter. As a result, rates of carbon fixation may decrease because of stimulated respiration.

AB This paper defines landscape-scale patterns in the character of natural organic matter (NOM) and tests for relationships to catchment soil, vegetation and topography. The drainage network of a boreal catchment, subcatchment size 0.12-78 km(2), in Northern Sweden was sampled in August 2002 during a period of stable low water flow. The NOM was characterized with UV/Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence, XAD-8 fractionation (%humic substances), gel permeation chromatography (apparent molecular weight), and elemental composition (C:N). The largest spatial variation was found for C: N, absorbance ratio, and specific visible absorptivity. The lowest variation was in fluorescence index, %humic substances and molecular retention time. The variation in total organic carbon (TOC), iron and aluminium concentration was more than twice that of C: N. Between headwater and downstream sites no significant changes were distinguished in the NOM character. At stream reaches, junctions and lakes little change (<10%) in NOM character was observed. Common factor analysis and partial least squares regression (PLS) revealed that the spatial variation in surface coverage of lakes and mires could explain some of the variation of TOC and NOM character. Our suggestion is that the mosaic of landscape elements (different amounts of water from lakes, forest soil and mires) delivers NOM with varying characteristics to a channel network that mixes conservatively downstream, with possible small changes at some stream reaches, junctions and lakes.

AB Testate amoeba transfer functions are widely used for reconstruction of palaeo-hydrological regime in peatlands. However, the limitations of this approach have become apparent with increasing attention to validation and assessing sources of uncertainty. This paper investigates effects of peatland type and sampling depth on the performance of a transfer function using an independent test-set from four Sphagnum-dominated sites in European Russia (Penza Region). We focus on transfer function performance along localised hydrological gradients, which is a useful analogue for predictive ability through time. The performance of the transfer function with the independent test-set was generally weaker than for the leave-one-out or bootstrap cross-validations. However, the transfer function was robust for the reconstruction of relative changes in water-table depth, provided the presence of good modern analogues and overlap in water-table depth ranges. When applied to subsurface samples, the performance of the transfer function was reduced due to selective decomposition, the presence of deep-dwelling taxa or vertical transfer of shells. Our results stress the importance of thorough testing of transfer functions, and highlight the role of taphonomic processes in determining results. Further studies of stratification, taxonomy and taphonomy of testate amoebae will be needed to improve the robustness of transfer function output. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Testate amoebae are abundant in the surface layers of northern peatlands. Analysis of their fossilized shell (test) assemblages allows for reconstructions of local water-table depths (WTD). We have reconstructed WTD dynamics for five peat cores from peatlands ranging in distance from the Athabasca bituminous sands (ABS) region in western Canada. Amoeba assemblages were combined with plant macrofossil records, acid-insoluble ash (AIA) fluxes and instrumental climate data to identify drivers for environmental change. Two functional traits of testate amoebae, mixotrophy and the tendency to integrate xenogenic mineral matter in test construction, were quantified to infer possible effects of AIA flux on testate amoeba presence. Age-depth models showed the cores each covered at least the last 315years, with some spanning the last millennium. Testate amoeba assemblages were likely affected by permafrost development in two of the peatlands, yet the most important shift in assemblages was detected after 1960 CE. This shift represents a significant apparent lowering of water tables in four out of five cores, with a mean drop of 15cm. Over the last 50years, assemblages shifted towards more xerophilous taxa, a trend which was best explained by increasing Sphagnum s. Acutifolia and, to a lesser extent, mean summer temperature. This trend was most evident in the two cores from the sites located farthest away from the ABS region. AIA flux variations did not show a clear effect on mineral-agglutinating taxa, nor on S.s.Acutifolia presence. We therefore suggest the drying trend was forced by the establishment of S.s.Acutifolia, driven by enhanced productivity following regional warming. Such recent apparent drying of peatlands, which may only be reconstructed by appropriate indicators combined with high chronological control, may affect vulnerability to future burning and promote emissions of CO2.

AB The ability to predict the response of peatland ecosystems to hydrologic changes is imperative for successful conservation and remediation efforts. We studied a 1.25-ha Vermont kettlehole bog for one year (September 2001-October 2002) to identify hydrologic controls, temporal and spatial variability in flow regimes, and to link hydrologic processes to density of the carnivorous plant (Sarracenia purpurea), an ombrotrophic bog specialist. Using a spatial array of nested piezometers, we measured surface and subsurface flow in shallow peat and surrounding mineral soil. Our unique sampling array was based on a repeated measures factorial design with: (1) incremental distances from a central kettlehole pond; (2) equal distances between piezometers; and (3) at three depths from the peat surface.
   Local flow patterns in the peat were controlled by snowpack storage during winter and spring months and by evapotranspiration and pond water elevation during summer and fall months. Hydraulic head values showed a local reversal within the peat during spring months which was reflected in higher chemical constituent concentrations in these wells. On a regional scale, higher permeable soils diverted groundwater beneath the peatland to a nearby wetland complex. Horizontal water gradient magnitudes were larger in zones where the peatland was perched above regional groundwater and smaller in zones where a hydraulic connection existed between the peatland and the regional groundwater. The density of pitcher plants (S. purpurea) is strongly correlated to the distance from a central pond, [Fe3+], [Na+], [Cl-], and [SO42-]. The pH, conductivity, and [Ca2+] had significant effects of depth and time with horizontal distance correlations between 20 and 26 m. The pH samples had temporal correlations between 27 and 79 days. The link between pitcher plants and ion chemistry; significant effects of peatland chemistry on distance, depth, and time; and spatial and temporal correlations are important considerations for peatland restoration strategies.

AB . Fen meadows (Cirsio dissecti-Molinietum) are seriously threatened by desiccation, acidification and eutro-phication. In The Netherlands several projects were launched to restore damaged fen meadows. This review describes how successes and failures of these restoration projects depend on hydrological systems. Six hydrological systems have been distinguished, which all provide the site conditions required by this community. Nowadays, the best developed fen meadows are found in the higher Pleistocene landscape of The Netherlands, where they depend on base-rich groundwater discharging from local or large groundwater systems. Fen meadows of the lower Holocene landscape usually occur in man-made surface water systems. Almost all stands have been severely deteriorated. Restoration of fen meadows in the Pleistocene landscape is promising when the hydrology is only slightly disturbed or when hydrological measures are taken in combination with sod cutting. Restoration prospects of fen meadows in the Holocene landscape are low. Until now a complete regeneration of Cirsio-Molinietum meadows has not been realized. Restoration measures failed to restore high pH values in the top soil. It is hypothesized that viable seeds of many target species lack in the soil seed bank. In addition, the dispersal capacities of these species seem to be limited.

AB [1] Methane fluxes were measured at five sites representing oligotrophic peatlands along a European transect. Five study plots were subjected to elevated CO2 concentration (560 ppm), and five plots to NH4NO3 (3 or 5 g N yr(-1)). The CH4 emissions from the control plots correlated in most cases with the soil temperatures. The depth of the water table, the pH, and the DOC, N and SO4 concentrations were only weakly correlated with the CH4 emissions. The elevated CO2 treatment gave nonsignificantly higher CH4 emissions at three sites and lower at two sites. The N treatment resulted in higher methane emissions at three sites (nonsignificant). At one site, the CH4 fluxes of the N-treatment plots were significantly lower than those of the control plots. These results were not in agreement with our hypotheses, nor with the results obtained in some earlier studies. However, the results are consistent with the results of the vegetation analyses, which showed no significant treatment effects on species relationships or biomass production.

AB Although it is well established that moisture availability in south-eastern Australia has been decreasing through time recently, the driver(s) of this trend are contentious, and our understanding of any drivers is limited by a relatively short historic record. Testate amoebae have been widely used to reconstruct peatland hydrology in the Northern Hemisphere, but in the Southern Hemisphere research is still needed to assess their proficiency as a palaeohydrological proxy and to develop robust transfer functions. Here we examine the ecology of testate amoebae in several high altitude mires in south-eastern Australia and present the first transfer function for the continent. Euglypha tuberculata type, Centropyxis platystoma type and Assulina muscorum were the most common taxa in our modern samples. Water-table depth was the primary environmental variable determining testate amoebae assemblages and therefore transfer functions were developed for this ecological factor. We found that the performance of various all-species and species-pruned transfer functions were statistically robust, with R-2 values of around 0.8 and Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction (RMSEP) values of about 7 cm. All cross validation methods (leave-one-out RMSEP, cluster-bootstrap RMSEP, segment-wise RMSEP and leave-one-site out RMSEP from all-species and species-pruned transfer functions) suggested that the Modern Analogue Technique (MAT) was the best performing transfer function, with negligible bias evident from un-even sampling and spatial autocorrelation. We also used a new approach to evaluate the importance of taxa and the performance of our transfer functions using species-pruned methods. Our results suggest that the all-species MAT, with an RMSEP of 5.73 and R-2 of 0.86, provides the best reconstruction of water-table depth across our sites in south-eastern Australia.

AB The closed chamber technique has been widely employed to detect methane emissions, despite little being known about whether the absence or presence of light will impact the flux estimation. Here, we employed a laser greenhouse gas analyzer with an opaque-transparent chamber pair to measure the methane emission rate in a boreal peatland complex. Microtopography (i.e., hummocks and hollows) in natural and drained peatlands, and plant communities (i.e., grasses and shrubs) in a pasture converted from natural peatlands, were considered to cover the local heterogeneity. Our results indicated that opaque chambers (0.58-0.78 g CH4 m(-2) during the growing season) measured a significantly higher (similar to 2-3 times) methane emission at the hummocks than transparent chambers (similar to 0.24 g CH4 m(-2)); however, a similar phenomenon was not found at the hollows or at other measurement plots. Gross photosynthesis explained 44%-47% of the temporal variation of the 'artificial bias' (the difference in methane flux obtained by the opaque versus transparent chambers) at the hummocks. Additionally, both water table depth and surface soil moisture significantly explained spatial variations of methane emissions. Our study suggests that microtopography has a significant influence on the artificial bias in methane emission estimation and the artificial properties of a chamber (transparency/opacity) method can be vitally important in some cases (i.e., hummocks), and negligible in others (i.e., hollows). The observed connection between the photosynthesis process and the 'artificial bias' of closed chambers (opaque versus transparent) can be used to improve methane flux modeling. Separate parameterization schemes are needed for methane transportation under the presence or absence of light.

AB Variability of midday net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and respiration was measured using a transect of closed system chambers spanning transitions from channel fen, permafrost plateau, and ombrotrophic flat bog land cover types during the spring melt season (26 April-6 June 2008). The primary objective was to compare fluxes from different land cover types and topographic variability within zones adjacent to and including rapid permafrost thaw. During this period, the bog was the greatest net source of CO2 to the atmosphere, followed by plateau, and fen. NEE was slightly positive (indicating CO2 loss to the atmosphere) during the snowmelt period (average = 0.009 +/- 0.004 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), and increased to 0.025 +/- 0.012 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) on average, possibly due to soil thaw and increased microbial activity within two days of completely snow-free conditions. Near surface soil temperature and depth to the water table were the most significant controls of soil and ground cover CO2 fluxes within chambers at all sites (p<0.05). Analysis of historical aerial photographs and satellite imagery of the area from 1947 to 2008 indicates that plateaus are converting more rapidly into bogs than fen, where 73% of plateau areas (since 1970) that thawed had become bogs (as opposed to 27% conversion into fen). Future research requires establishment of a full ecosystem or land cover greenhouse gas and soil nutrient exchange/transfer program, including CO2 and water fluxes as well as dissolved organic and inorganic C, and CH4 losses from the soil. These results contribute to a better understanding of northern soil and ground-cover carbon exchanges as greater areas of permafrost plateaus collapse and form bogs.

AB Plant species-rich Calthion meadows on mesotrophic fen pear soil extensively cut for hay are among the endangered semi-natural vegetation types in northwestern Europe. They are often badly affected by lowering the groundwater table (drainage) and fertilization.
   In a comparative study of an undrained site with a Calthion meadow and an adjacent drained site, availability of N, P and K was biologically assessed under field conditions (for two years) as well as in a greenhouse (for 18 weeks) by measuring shoot responsiveness. Also, experimental wetting of intact turf samples taken from both sites was applied in order to study the interaction between nutrient supply and anaerobic soil conditions. It was concluded that the above-ground phytomass yield in the undrained site was restricted by a major shortage of N-supply and a moderate shortage of K-supply by the fen peat soil. The above-ground phytomass yield of the drained site was only reduced by a strongly limited supply of K by the soil. The extent of K-deficiency was larger for the drained site. No P-deficiency was observed in any of the drained or undrained sites. Rewetting turf samples, taken from the drained site, did not change above-ground phytomass yields, suggesting that nutrient supplies were not affected by rewetting. Leaching has likely resulted in a strong reduction of K-supply in the drained site. It is assumed that a shortage in K-supply from the peat soil may have become an important environmental constraint for characteristic plant species of Calthion meadows. This may hamper the development of this meadow type on drained peat soils after rewetting by groundwater discharge.

AB Boreal peatland energy balances using the eddy covariance technique have previously been made in Alaska, Canada, Scandinavia, and Western Siberia, but not in the European portion of the Russian Federation. European Russia contains approximately 200,000 km(2) of peatlands and has a boreal (subarctic), continental climate influencing the region's energy balance. To help fill this research gap, the surface energy balance was determined for a boreal peatland fen in the Komi Republic of Russia for an 11-month period in 2008-2009 using the eddy covariance method. The total measurement period's cumulative energy balance closure rate was 86%, with higher closure during the critical summer growing season. Similar to other boreal peatland sites, the mid-summer shortwave radiation demonstrated albedo between 0.13 and 0.19 as calculated on a cumulative monthly basis, whereas monthly albedo was >0.9 during the months with greatest snow (January, February 2009). Mid-summer Bowen ratios averaged 0.20-0.25 on a cumulative basis, with monthly averaged mid-day values in the range 0.35-0.53 during the growing season. Latent energy (LE) fluxes exceeded 70% of net radiation and 60% of potential evapotranspiration. During the study period, total evapotranspiration (406 mm) was slightly greater than rainfall (389 mm), with later snowfalls creating excess moisture in the atmospheric water budget. These characteristics together point to a peatland whose energy balance behavior is generally consistent with data from other boreal fens. The LE fluxes were dominantly controlled by net radiation, with less canopy resistance than at other northern fens and a lighter role for vapor pressure deficit to play in the energy balance. The aerodynamic and canopy conductance terms were of similar magnitude, both through the season and through any given diurnal cycle. The consequently high decoupling coefficient (0.65 +/- 0.16 in the growing season) allows further modeling of fens in this region with reduced effects from the uncertainties of parameterizing surface conductance terms and their responses to water table and vapor pressure deficit changes. The Priestley-Taylor method provides a reasonable approach to modeling evapotranspiration, given some assumptions about the site's energy balance closure. This understanding of the local drivers on the energy and water budgets has important implications for peatland ecology and growth, regional carbon dynamics, and downstream hydrology.

AB Characteristic species of sedge-moss fen communities occur in constantly wet, nutrient-poor sites with a high penetration of light through the vegetation canopy. We studied the effects of water table depth and differences in light intensity on the performance of fen species. Three fen species (Carex curta, Viola palustris, Hydrocotyle vulgaris) and one species with a wide range of occurrence (Poa trivialis) were grown for 10 weeks in a sedge-moss peat substrate at 4 different water levels and 3 light intensities. In all species differences in light availability had a larger effect on biomass production than differences in water level. Under a light availability reduced to only 10% the root weight ratio of all the species decreased while leaf weight ratio increased. The biomass allocation ratios were hardly affected by differences in water level. For Viol a and Hydrocotyle an interaction between the two factors was observed. Poa did not show particular differences compared to the other species. We discuss the results in the context of the establishment of fen species in riparian vegetation. It is suggested that the occurrence of fen species in the landscape is directly related to the availability of light, whereas the relationship between fen species occurrence and hydrological conditions seems to be an indirect one.

AB Similarly to drainage caused by land-use change, the predicted climate warming may cause a moderate water-level drawdown in northern peatlands due to increased evapotranspiration. This is likely to alter the frequency and severity of peatland fires. We surveyed the fire pattern in drainage-affected and unmanaged parts of a boreal raised bog using three sampling transects reaching from drainage-affected area to an unmanaged bog area. Throughout the bog, dry hummock surfaces provided spreading routes for fire while hollows remained intact. Drainage promoted succession that lead to the dominance of hummock vegetation close to the drained area. Consequently, drainage succession favoured fire. The results suggest an increase in fire impact as a consequence of lowered water levels. In warmer climate with increased evapotranspiration bogs are likely to become more vulnerable to fires.

AB The research was carried out in three catenas, in which the soils made a typical toposequence of the moraine landscape in Masurian Lakeland, i.e. eroded soils, deluvial soils, mucky soils as well as slightly and strongly silted peat-muck soils. The total content of Ca, Mg, K, P, Na, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu was analyzed in these soils. The amounts of soil organic matter and measured elements showed catenal variation. Mucky soils had the highest content of Mg, K, Fe and Na whereas strongly and slightly silted peat-muck soils contained the highest amounts of P, Mn, Ca and Cu. The content of Ca was positively correlated with organic matter content. The amount of Mg, K, Cu and Mn was positively correlated with the amount of clay fraction. As the studied soils are located at the bottom of a slope, downwards water flow, where mineral compounds are accumulated in deposits or dissolved in water, mucky soils and silted peat-muck soils contain high amounts of the analyzed elements. Mucky soils and silted peat-muck soils play a role of biogeochemical barriers protecting wetlands against nutrients from surrounding moraine uplands.
   Surface horizons of deluvial soils were depleted of the analyzed elements (excluding P) whereas AO horizons of mucky soils and Mt horizons of peat-muck soils were abundant in the measured elements (excluding Ca). Various amounts of the analyzed elements in the pedons of the catena sequences should be taken into consideration when planning land use in the moraine landscape, which has unique natural values.

SO SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY
LA English

ID SOUTHERN AUSTRALIA; CARBONATE
AB The sedimentary infill of the Acigol maar lake, one of the volcanic centres in the Cappadocia district of Anatolia, contains unusual, high-calorific sub-Recent peat deposits, of which the origin is' attributed to geothermal processes. The sedimentary facies record is analyzed to reconstruct the lake's depositional history and to disentangle the combined signal of climatic and geothermal factors. The facies succession comprises: a lake-fringe elastic apron shed from the maar walls; early-stage, coarse-grained tuffaceous deposits of the lake proper, intercalated with brecciated mudstones and limestones; and final-stage, fine-grained tuffaceous deposits of the lake proper, intercalated with peats and plant-bearing clastics and with some terminal travertines. The closed lake was highly dependent on climate, particularly precipitation, and the depositional conditions were further controlled by a connective hydrothermal system which itself was driven by the input of meteoric water. The associated heat flow played an important role by creating a microclimatic niche, where even the impoverished late-Quaternary (cold regional climate) vegetation could flourish and form substantial peats. The varying hydrological budget of the lake was the main ''switching'' mechanism for the peat-forming conditions, with two water-depth thresholds involved. If the lake level rose too high, the low vegetation was drowned and hemipelagic elastic sedimentation prevailed. If the lake level fell too low, the vegetation was killed and formation of travertine took place. The heat flow through the pore water and elastic sediments was crucial to the high maturation of the peat deposits.

AB Upland swamps are a form of topogenous mire that occur on the plateau areas of eastern Australia. These systems are well recognized for their ecological value, but little is known about their internal hydrological function and how this relates to their geomorphic structure and evolution. In this study, the geomorphic, sedimentological, and hydrological properties of an intact upland swamp on the Budderoo Plateau NSW are investigated. The geomorphic structure of the swamp is simple, and the sedimentology comprises basal layers of coarse sands, overlain by several layers of organic accumulation up to 3.3 m in thickness. Each of these sedimentary units has different hydrological behaviors (rates of water throughflow and discharge) that drive the overall function of the swamp in response to rainfall of various magnitudes and duration. Four hydrological response types have been identified in the functioning of this swamp. These response types (RT) are characterized by different peaks and recession responses to rainfall. The form of the hydrograph produced is controlled by antecedent water table position and the amount, timing and duration of rainfall. Depending on antecedent moisture conditions, the swamp can operate either as a store for water or as a rapid conduit for water throughflow and overland flow.

AB Despite their common global occurrence, little work has been done on characterizing the hydraulic properties of root mats, particularly their hydraulic conductivity K. A common method for estimating K in the field is the piezometer slug test. In some root mat systems, the piezometer slug test may be the only technique, field or laboratory, that is able to provide reliable estimates of K. We installed 17 piezometers in a Cladium mariscus L. (Pohl) and Phragmites australis Cav. (Streud.) root mat in a UK fen. Tests were initiated by both slug insertion and slug withdrawal. Repeat tests were conducted on some piezometers to check for test consistency. Rapid recoveries after both slug insertion and withdrawal were found, with 90% recovery reached for all tests within 1500 s and for many within 300 s. We found significant and highly reproducible differences between recovery after insertion and recovery after withdrawal, with the latter being more rapid than the former. We invoke a reversible pore blocking mechanism to explain this behaviour. Many of the piezometers showed recoveries after withdrawal that were broadly consistent with the assumption of a rigid porous medium in which Darcy's law holds. Tests on four further piezometers were used to examine the impact of piezometer 'development', different slug sizes and the use of 'clean' water on test behaviour. The results from these test piezometers were difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, it appears that replacing 'dirty' water in the piezometer standpipe with clean water leads to more rapid recoveries and reduces the difference between recovery after insertion and recovery after withdrawal. The K of the root mat, as estimated from withdrawal tests on 14 piezometers and standardized to 20degreesC, ranged between 0.00144 and 0.03022 cm s(-1). This appears to be at the very top end of K values reported for fen peats and suggests that water can flow readily through this medium given sufficiently large hydraulic gradients.

AB Water and energy fluxes control the development of northern peatlands and influence their carbon budget. Blanket bogs are peatlands that occur in temperate maritime regions where precipitation is much greater than evapotranspiration (ET). In this paper, five years (October 2002-September 2007) of ET and energy fluxes derived from eddy-covariance measurements were analyzed in the context of the predicted climate change for Ireland. Monthly ET at the Glencar Atlantic blanket bog varied little, ranging between a minimum of 12 mm month(-1) and a maximum of 56 mm month-1 over the five years, resulting in an annual ET average of 394 mm, with typical highest daily values of 2.5-3.0 mm. Compared to other peatland types, Glencar had lower summer ET and a lower ET/potential ET ratio, despite having higher precipitation and water table. The ET was limited not only by the low vapor pressure deficit and cool summer temperatures but also by the low cover of vascular plants and mosses (essential for transpiration). The energy budget was similar to other peatland types in terms of net radiation and sensible heat fluxes, but had lower latent and higher ground heat fluxes. A comparison among the five years suggests that the predicted climate change (greater winter precipitation, lower summer precipitation, and higher all year round temperatures) will probably increase winter ET, while the summer energy flux patterns will not be profoundly affected. However, if the frequency of summer rain events should diminish, the moss component of these ecosystems may become water stressed, ultimately leading to lower evapotranspiration.

AB In the absence of management and with sustained non-point source pollution, the diversity of European low productive herbaceous vegetation is under threat. In many cases dominant grasses exclude other species. Molinia caerulea is such a potential dominant species. In a Campine rich fen near Mol, aerial photos show progressive invasion by M. caerulea tussocks. Marginal zones are completely closed by M. caerulea, while in ground water discharge zones open low growing vegetation persists mixed with small M. caerulea tussocks or non-tussock individuals. During the tussock development process, M. caerulea shows a preference for the slightly drier marginal sites, contrary to the wettest ground-water discharge flushes where it is present as non-tussock individual shoots. This contrast was used to make a comparative study between zones and growth form of M. caerulea and its relation with neighbouring species. We investigate the hypothesis that differential M caerulea performance is caused by differences in nutrient availability. Biomass and nutrient concentrations of M . caerulea shoots were investigated in relation to their location (marginal I ground-water discharge) and in relation to their growth form (spread non-tussock individual shoots / tussock shoots). M. caerulea shoots from marginal sites grew larger than shoots from central sites and tussock shoots proved superior to individual shoots. From the nutrient concentrations and the known P-limitation of the site, it is concluded that the P-availability is responsible. It appears that M. caerulea tussocks set up an efficient retranslocation of P. The mechanism is also present in non-tussock individuals, where it proved more efficient in the marginal sites. The biomass and N- and P concentration in M. caerulea leaves from non-tussock individuals and tussocks of increasing height in the ground-water discharge sites were investigated. June leaf P-concentrations, were unexpectedly low in shoots from small (10-30 cm) tussocks as compared to non-tussock shoots. This invalidates a straightforward relation between P-availability and M. caerulea development in the wettest sites. Possible explanations are discussed. Overall the set-up of an efficient retranslocation of P seems crucial in the development of M. caerulea dominance in this type of fens.

AB Peatlands are large natural sources of atmospheric methane (CH4). While many studies have measured CH4 emissions to the atmosphere, less is known about the stock and residence time of subsurface CH4. In this study we examined dissolved CH4 concentration in near-surface peatland pore waters of a poor fen near Quebec City, Canada, in order to (1) investigate the variability in and potential controls on these concentrations and (2) combine measured dissolved CH4 concentration with estimated bubble CH4 stock and measured CH4 fluxes to estimate the mean residence time of subsurface CH4. Concentrations ranged from 1 to 450 mu M during both study seasons. Depth profiles were generally consistent at one location within the peatland throughout the sampling period but varied between locations. Patterns with depth were not well correlated to pore water pH or EC; however, changes in CH4 concentration through time in the upper 30 cm were related to temperature and water table at some locations. Depth profiles taken at 2- to 5-cm intervals revealed discrete concentration "spikes'' which were often maintained throughout the season and are likely related to bubble CH4 dynamics. Estimated subsurface CH4 stocks indicate that even when relatively low bubble volume (5% of peat volume) is assumed, bubble CH4 accounted for greater than half of total stocks. Calculated mean residence times were 28-120 days. This implies that CH4 flux may lag changes in water table and temperature which happen on shorter timescales (hours or days). To improve our description of subsurface CH4 stocks, links between dissolved and bubble CH4 stocks and peatland CH4 residence time, coincident measurement of pore water CH4 concentrations, entrapped gas content and composition, diffusive CH4 flux, and ebullition are required.

AB Eddy covariance measurements of evapotranspiration at a wetland tundra sedge fen near Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, from 15 June to 21 August, 2007, were used to calculate hourly resistance values for the peat component of the fen's surface. Inherent in the calculations were the assumptions that evaporation from the open water and transpiration from the living sedge components of the fen's surface, as well as the aerodynamic resistance, could be reasonably well modeled. Fitting a curve to these results provided a regression model for the daytime variation of the hourly surface resistance to evaporation from the peat. It was concluded that the surface resistance, which was relatively low during the morning hours and increased during the afternoon hours, reflected, in part, a diurnal wetting and drying of the near surface layer. This insight into the daytime variation of resistance to evaporation from the peat surface of a wetland tundra sedge fen may be of assistance in the formulation of land-surface schemes.

AB Peatland drainage results in several environmental impacts such as release of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere and leaching of nutrients to watercourses. These hazardous environmental effects can partly be controlled with soil management, and different drainage and remediation practices. Grading is a new method developed for soils with low conductivity suffering from poor drainage, water logging and ice. The soil surface is graded towards the ditch to increase surface runoff and drainage. The present study compares environmental effects of peatland grading compared to traditional intense pipe drainage. Detailed measurements of hydrology, climate, leaching and gas emissions were carried Out at adjacent drainage areas with grass cultivation. Additional measurements were made at plots that were abandoned, cultivated with perennial crops, and remained as pristine peatlands. The results show that the leaching of nutrients is highest from pipe drainage. Climate gas emission was considerably higher at all managed sites than from the reference pristine site. Drainage, soil hydrology and soil nutrient status seemed to control gas emissions. The gas emissions were higher than assumed for Norwegian cold conditions. The results confirm observations made on peat soils in other climatic regions. The highest emissions of CO2 were observed when the soil temperature was high and groundwater table low. The N2O emission showed a large variation with no clear pattern. However, at some locations it peaked after a dry period when NO3-N was leached. More CH4 was emitted from the intensively drained site than the graded site, but more CO2 was emitted from the graded site. The difference in leaching and emission properties is partly due to differences in near surface hydrology. At grade sites, a faster runoff response to rainfall occur probably due to shallow throughfall or overland flow which provides better drainage. The abandoned peat field no longer in cultivation continued to leach greenhouse gases in a same way as the Cultivated sites. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PEAT
AB Prediction of the effects of external influences such as climate change on wetland systems requires the prediction of hydrologic effects. Because wetland soils are typically heterogeneous, it is particularly important to understand the extent and connectedness of hydraulically conductive soil units, since water flow may be concentrated in such units while bypassing others of lower conductivity. However, subsurface hydrologic models typically do not represent heterogeneity adequately, being limited by sparse parameterization of soil properties. Conventional techniques for mapping units of soil within wetlands are highly laborious, requiring soil coring and laboratory testing. As an alternative, we developed a portable piezocone driver and highly sensitive piezocone designed to map wetland soil units with centimeter-scale resolution in the vertical and meter-scale resolution in the horizontal dimension. This system successfully delineated several different layers of peat, sand, and limnetic sediments, and their degree of interconnectedness in an eight-meter-thick peat deposit. Monitoring of wetland response to precipitation, changes in stream stage, and overbank flooding was then used in conjunction with the piezocone data and a two-dimensional flow model to constrain the hydraulic properties of the soil units. Thus parameterized, a standard subsurface flow model was able to realistically simulate a variety of hydrologic processes relevant to climate change, including wetland-stream water exchange, the movement of wetland porewaters to the root zone of plants, and wetland desaturation under dry conditions.

Existing tools mostly require species identification, thus allowing to estimating changes in biodiversity, and possibly inferring ecosystem functioning, using functional diversity and traits based approaches.
   Testate amoebae are good indicators of surface moisture conditions in Sphagnum peatlands and are routinely used in palaeoecology. Their shells (tests), on which identification is based, can also be used to define functional traits and thus to infer changes in ecosystem functioning.
   We investigated the response of testate amoeba communities to manipulated water table depth (wet: 4 cm, intermediate: -15 cm, and dry: -25 cm) over time (seven time points, 19 months) using mesocosms by comparing two approaches: community structure and functional traits responses, using a combination of morphological (biovolume, length, aperture size and position) and physiological (mixotrophy/heterotrophy, shell material) traits.
   This is the first study investigating the effect of water table depth on testate amoeba assemblages over time using a mesocosm approach. Taxonomical and functional approaches showed similar response patterns, confirming that water level acted as a strong environmental filter. After one year Hyalosphenia papilio decreased in the dry treatment, and the community structure shifted towards a dominance of dry indicators (Nebela tincta complex, Corythion dubiurn, Euglypha compressa) and the selected functional traits (smaller, heterotrophic, compressed species, with a ventral aperture) corresponded to drought adaptations.
   In line with recent observational and transfer function studies exploring the use of testate amoebae functional traits, our experimental results illustrate how well-selected traits could be used to monitor the impact of present and past climatic changes on Sphagnum peatlands.

AB Changes in surface wetness on Holocene ombrotrophic mires have principally been estimated from plant macrofossils and humification. Testate amoebae (Protozoa: Rhizopoda) provide an additional technique and have the potential to provide improved quantitative estimates of water-table depths and soil moisture. The relationship between hydrology and testate amoebae assemblages from 163 samples on nine British mires is explored using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Mean annual water-table depth and percentage soil moisture are two of the most important environmental variables related to the distribution of testate amoebae within pear. Transfer functions for these variables are developed using four underlying models; weighted averaging (WA), tolerance downweighted weighted averaging (WA-Tol), weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) and partial least squares (PLS). In 'jack-knifed' validation, WA produced the lowest prediction errors for water table, but was outperformed by WA-Tor for percentage moisture. WA and WA-Tol based transfer functions are then applied to a fossil data set from Bolton Fell Moss, Cumbria. This methodology offers a new technique for reconstructing surface wetness changes on British ombrotrophic and oligotrophic mires and provides data in terms of a meaningful environmental parameter. The cosmopolitan distribution of testate amoebae species suggests that the technique has a much wider geographical potential.

AB It is generally recognized that fens and the rare species they support can only be effectively managed and protected by treating them as part of a larger, connected groundwater system. However, this underlying groundwater system is often not well understood. In this research, a geographic information system (GIS)-enabled, hierarchical modeling approach was applied to simulate the multiscale groundwater flow systems for several critical habitat units of the endangered Hine's emerald dragonfly (HED) in Michigan. In particular, models for six habitat units were developed and calibrated to static water level measurements. Reverse particle tracking was used to trace source water and delineate the groundwater contribution areas for the habitat units. The results reveal that the units obtain water from regional groundwater mounds through direct or cascading connections. The travel time for groundwater from the mounds to reach the habitat units varied between 25days and almost 11years. These findings suggest that the current approach to fen conservation must be reassessed, from the protection of individual fens to conservation of the broad recharge areas and the multiple fens they support.

AB Wetland restoration management is an important tool for stakeholders and practitioners to mitigate climate change and preserve ecological functioning. Various approaches to modifying the water management of a catchment for restoration purposes exist and were performed in a preservation area in northwest Germany. To validate the effect of the re-wetting practice, a monitoring network of 46 wells was established and monthly readings were taken from 1997 onwards. A declining trend in water table depth was present at 39 wells and equaled on average a lowering of 20 cm during the study period from 1997 to 2012. So far, half of the trend lines are above 40 cm below ground, which is an indicator of an effective re-wetting practice, but they will decline below this threshold until 2032 according to linear regression analysis. The progress of water table depths might be accelerated by climate change. According to the meteorological forecast, air temperatures will rise and the annual precipitation pattern will change. Thus, the climatic water balance tends toward more negative values in the summer and positive values in the winter, favoring an earlier and more intense water table draw-down. Because root water extraction from shallow groundwater is limited to a certain depth, the forecast of water table depth development according to the recent trend depicts a worst-case scenario. Nevertheless, the results emphasize that restoration management should be validated and has to be adapted in certain ways when mitigating the impact of climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The low conductivity landfill barrier layers protect the groundwater and soil by limiting the water flow through the bottom layers of the landfill material. Many materials used in hydraulic barrier layers also have sorption properties which could be used to reduce environmental risks. The adsorption of lead, chromium, copper, and arsenic to peat was studied with a batch-type test and a column test for compacted peat, both without pH adjustment in acidic conditions. Peat adsorbed all the metals well, 40000 mg/kg of lead, 13000 mg/kg of chromium, and 8400 mg/kg of copper in the column test. Arsenic was only tested in a batch-type test, and in that peat adsorbed 60 mg/kg of arsenic. The column test showed heavy metals to be adsorbed on the surface layers of the compacted peat sample, on the first centimeter of the sample. The adsorption was much greater in the column test than in the batch-type test, partly due to the different pH conditions and the buffer capacity of the peat in the column test. The liquid/solid ratio of the column experiment represented a time period of approximately 40 years in a landfill, under Finnish climate conditions. The hydraulic conductivity of the peat decreased as it was compressed, but it already met the hydraulic conductivity limits set by European Union legislation for the hydraulic barrier layer (1 x 10(-9) m/s at a pressure of 150 kPa for a 5-m layer), with a pressure of 50 kPa. The results show that peat would be an excellent material to construct compacted, low hydraulic conductivity layers with adsorption properties in, e.g. industrial waste landfills.

AB Ditch networks in drained peatland forests are maintained regularly to prevent water table rise and subsequent decrease in tree growth. The growing tree stand itself affects the level of water table through evapotranspiration, the magnitude of which is closely related to the living stand volume. In this study, regression analysis was applied to quantify the relationship between the late summer water table depth (D(WT)) and tree stand volume, mean monthly summertime precipitation (P(s)), drainage network condition, and latitude. The analysis was based on several large data sets from southern to northern Finland, including concurrent measurements of stand volume and summer water table depth. The identified model demonstrated a nonlinear effect of stand volume on D(WT), a linear effect of P(s) on D(WT), and an interactive effect of both stand volume and P(s). Latitude and ditch depth showed only marginal influence on D(WT). A separate analysis indicated that an increase of 10 m(3).ha(-1) in stand volume corresponded with a drop of 1 cm in water table level during the growing season. In a subsample of the data, high bulk density peat showed deeper D(WT) than peat with low bulk density at the same stand volume.

   LIPIDS; CH4 EMISSION
AB Permafrost peatlands are both an important source of atmospheric CH4 and a substantial sink for atmospheric CO2. Climate change can affect this balance, with higher temperatures resulting in the conversion of permafrost soils to wetlands and associated accelerated mineralisation and increased CH4 emission. To better understand the impact of such processes on methanogen populations, we investigated the anaerobic decay of soil carbon in a low Arctic, discontinuous permafrost peatland. Cores were collected monthly from sedge and Sphagnum mires in north Sweden during the summer of 2006. We determined CH4 concentrations and production potentials, together with variations in the size of the methanogenic community as indicated by concentrations of archaeal lipid biomarkers (phosphorylated archaeol, archaeol and hydroxyarchaeol). Concentrations of methanogen biomarkers generally were higher at the sedge site, increased with depth for all sites and months, and were usually below the detection limits in shallow (<10cm) Sphagnum peat. The distribution of biomarkers reflects the strong influence of water table depth on anaerobic conditions and methanogen populations, while differences in biomarker concentrations can be explained by differences in vegetation cover and pH. However, methanogen populations inferred from biomarker data show a decoupling from in-situ CH4 production over the season and from CH4 production potential, suggesting that other factors such as the availability of labile organic substrates can influence methanogen abundance. Archaeal lipid biomarkers appear to offer a potential new means to investigate permafrost biogeochemical processes but the interpretation of signals remains complex.

DT Article
DE Canada; Holocene; Hudson Bay Lowlands; methane; peatlands; testate

AB Wetlands are the largest natural source of methane, yet the roles of source region and paleoclimate in explaining the variability in Holocene atmospheric methane concentrations remain poorly constrained. The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) is one of the world's largest continuous peatland regions and a significant source of methane. We present here, using a novel proxy-based approach, Holocene methane fluxes for the HBL. Paleo-methane fluxes were quantified based on water table depth (WTD), inferred from testate amoeba assemblages in nine peat records. WTDs were reconstructed using a North American transfer function and were used to estimate paleo-methane flux through a linear regression model of contemporary growing season methane fluxes and WTDs from 88 sites across the region. Following HBL peatland initiation in the Middle Holocene, total methane flux is closely related to the increasing area of land emerging from below sea level, controlled by rapid rates of glacial isostatic adjustment. In the Late Holocene, rates of uplift slowed, but methane fluxes remained high due to lower evapotranspiration in a wetter and cooler climate. We estimate that 4.8 +/- 1.6 Pg C has been released from HBL peatlands to the atmosphere as CH4 over the last 8,000 years, with an average annual methane emission of 1.1 Tg CH4 yr(-1) in the Late Holocene. The values estimated here are broadly consistent with those calculated from other independent methods, on modern and Holocene timescales, demonstrating that testate amoeba records provide an effective approach for scaling local processes to regional paleo-methane emissions.

AB Protecting soils from sheet, rill, and gully erosion, from leaching out soil solutions, and from contamination for different reasons and protecting peat soils from wind erosion cannot exist apart from considering the state of the subsoil layers and anthropogenic measures such as drainage. The drainage parameters predetermine the possibility of a rise in the ground water level (GWL) from the levels where the drains are laid to the plow layer as a result of infiltration. The throughput capacity of soils may be such that, even with drainage, a surface runoff may form and water erosion may appear.

AB Energy carried by warm tropical water, transported via the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), plays a vital role in regulating the climate of regions bordering the North Atlantic Ocean. Previous phases of elevated freshwater input to areas of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) production in the early to mid-Holocene have been linked with slow-downs in the AMOC and changes in regional climate. Newfoundland's proximity in the North Atlantic region to the confluence of the Gulf Stream and the Labrador Current and to an area of NADW production in the Labrador Sea makes it an ideal testing ground to investigate the influence of past fluctuations in ocean circulation on terrestrial ecosystems. We use multi-proxy peat-based records from the east coast of Newfoundland to derive a proxy-climate signal for the past 8000 years, which we have compared with changes in ocean circulation. Prominent shifts towards near-surface bog water-table levels, reflecting cooler/wetter climatic conditions, are evident in the early mid-Holocene at c. 7830, 7500, 7220 and 6600 cal. BP with minor changes occurring at c. 6340 and 6110 cal. BP. These events are coherent with evidence of meltwater injections into the N. Atlantic and of reduced NADW production. More recent increases in bog surface wetness in the mid- to late Holocene at c. 4290 and c. 2610 cal. BP are also consistent with reported periods of reduced NADW production. Coherence between the bog-derived palaeoclimate record developed from Newfoundland and evidence of fluctuations in ocean current strength is apparent in the early mid-Holocene.

AB Wetland peat deposits can be excellent archives of past changes in the depositional and ecological conditions under which they formed. Part of the story of these changes can be obtained from analysis of the palynomorphs preserved in these deposits; however, a more meaningful reconstruction can be achieved by combining organic petrography with palynology. An example of this approach is presented from a study of three sites in the northern Everglades of Florida. The primary purpose of this study was to test these combined methods for their utility in distinguishing between long-term, natural successions and recent, anthropogenically-derived disruptions of the ecosystem (such as diversions of drainage and introductions of contaminants from human sources). The combined palyno-petrographic method (supported by Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating) was able to establish with some certainty the first appearance of contaminant-driven plant types (such as cattails and duckweeds) into the region, with the organic petrography being more accurate in determining the actual presence of invading plants at a particular site and the palynologic analysis providing a broader picture of regional changes in the ecosystem (such as the direction of the plant invasion). The distribution of petrographic pyrite in these freshwater peats provided an additional new piece of evidence for contamination from the agricultural lands and also supported other evidence relative to the direction of contaminant infusion into the region. Additionally, the occurrence of significant quantities of pyrite at all three sites suggests that, in fact, none of these sites can be said to be totally unaffected by anthropogenic contamination. Longer hydroperiods were generally indicated by both methods for all sites before the early 1900s, confirming persistently wetter conditions in the Everglades prior to manmade changes in drainage. More specific paleohydrologic conditions could also be elucidated by this combined method, with all three sites displaying significant differences in hydrologic histories. Additionally, one of the sitesis hypothesized to have been, until recently, in the center of a surface-water flow pathway, as indicated by the continuous presence at this site of deeper water aquatics (such as water lilies) and the smaller number of zones containing algal-derived carbonates and/or other petrographic indicators of oxidation or bioturbation.

AB Everglades freshwater marshes were once carbon sinks, but human-driven hydrologic changes have led to uncertainty about the current state of their carbon dynamics. To investigate the effect of hydrology on CO2 exchange, we used eddy covariance measurements for 2 years (2008-2009) in marl (short-hydroperiod) and peat (long-hydroperiod) wetlands in Everglades National Park. The importance of site, season, and environmental drivers was evaluated using linear and nonlinear modeling, and a novel method was used to test for temporally lagged patterns in the data. Unexpectedly, the long-hydroperiod peat marsh was a small CO2 source (19.9 g C m(-2) from July to December 2008 and 80.0 g C m(-2) in 2009), and at no time over the study period was it a strong sink. Contrary to previous research suggesting high productivity rates from a short-hydroperiod marsh, we estimated that the marl site was a small CO2 sink in 2008 (net ecosystem exchange [NEE] = -78.8 g C m(-2)) and was near neutral for carbon balance in 2009. In addition, both sites had relatively low gross ecosystem exchange (GEE) over the 2 years of this study. The two sites showed similar responses for NEE versus air temperature, ecosystem respiration (R-eco) versus air temperature, and R-eco versus water depth, although the magnitude of the responses differed. We saw small lags (30 min in most cases) between carbon fluxes and environmental drivers. This study is foundational for understanding the carbon balance of these ecosystems prior to implementation of the planned Everglades restoration of historical water flow that will likely alter the future trajectory of the carbon dynamics of the Everglades as a whole.

AB Blocking drainage ditches and creating bunds to limit surface water losses are important for restoring abandoned peat-extraction sites in North America. However, these runoff control techniques have not been well characterized, particularly during the snowmelt period. Therefore, patterns of runoff timing and magnitude were evaluated in a peatland (Bois-des-Bel, Quebec, Canada) undergoing restoration (restored site), in comparison with an unrestored section of the same peatland (unrestored site). Snowmelt dominated runoff, representing over 79% of the April to August runoff for both sites in 2001. Low (25-35 cm) bunds constructed on the restored site detained water for much of the melt period, but some water loss occurred where bunds were breached. Overland flow and surface ponding were prevalent at the restored site, but were not evident at the unrestored site. At the restored site, the presence of bunds and frozen, saturated (thus impermeable) ground contributed to differences in snowmelt runoff patterns relative to the unrestored site. In the post-snowmelt period (May-August 2001 and 2002), restored site runoff was reduced to 25% of that lost at the unrestored site. Both hydrometric and chemical hydrograph separation analysis using electrical conductivity indicated that blocked ditches restricted water losses from much of the restored site during the summer months, when the bunds had little effect on runoff. However, discharge peaks were greater at the restored site relative to the unrestored site and generally occurred more quickly following rainfall, because of the wetter antecedent conditions.

AB We studied phosphorous (P) export after clear-felling from eight Scots pine dominated, hydrologically isolated catchment areas located on a low-P sorptive peatland site in southern Finland, using the paired-catchments approach. Four of the catchment areas were clear-felled traditionally with stem-only harvesting, two areas were clear-felled using whole-tree harvesting, and the remaining two areas were treated with both whole-tree harvesting and stump harvesting. The effect of clear-felling on P loads varied considerably between the catchment areas from no increase to an increase of over 1.5 kg ha(-1) of P during the three-year-study period. The most significant factor explaining the variation in P loads and the variation in P concentrations in outflow water from clear-felled peatland catchments was the post-harvest water level position. At water table levels <20 cm below ground level (bgl), the P release from peat was greatly increased, and no influence was observed on P release at levels greater than 30 cm bgl. The water table depth explained about 50% of the variation in harvest induced P export, while the harvest method and the peat P sorption characteristics were not significant in explaining harvest-induced P loads or P concentrations after harvesting. The results of our study suggest that management of harvest residues may not be an efficient means of managing P export in operational forestry. In addition, forest management practices that do not lead to a rising of water table level near the soil surface in the entire harvest area, such as strip cutting and small-scale clear-cutting or harvesting small canopy openings, should be studied in order to reduce P export.

AB Long term research has been conducted into the hydrological effects of different land usage of a wetland mire in southern Germany. Drainage for agriculture lowered the water table and reduced evaporation from about 110% of open water losses to just under the Penman short grass potential rate. The runoff regime was altered and peak flows increased. Afforestation of agricultural land increased evaporation losses to much higher levels than open water evaporation, and annual runoff was nearly halved. Forest growth reduced soil water and baseflows. Peak flows became smaller; the rate of reduction was particularly rapid in the early years of tree growth.

AB Peatland is a significant ecosystem that has accumulated one-third of the soil carbon in boreal regions. However, the net carbon balance, particularly with current carbon emissions, remains unclear. In this study, the annual ecosystem respiration and CH4 fluxes from a peatland located in Northeast China are reported. Ecosystem respiration fluxes from the shrub-moss-and Eriophorum-dominated communities in the peatland varied from 12 to 272 mg Cm-2 h(-2) during the snow-free season, and the Eriophorumdominated community emitted more CO2. Rates of ecosystem respiration were strongly regulated by temperature and water table depth. The CH4 fluxes emitted from the peatland throughout a year varied with the type of the vegetation community during the snow-free season. No distinct episodic CH4 efflux during the freeze-thaw cycles was observed from the shrub-moss-dominated community, whereas a subtle pulse of CH4 was found in the Eriophorum-dominated community. The annual ecosystem respiration and CH4 fluxes from the peatland were 356 and 1.51 g Cm-2 per year, respectively. The contributions of CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the snowy season to annual emissions were much lower than those found in other boreal peatlands, whereas 24% of the annual methane flux was emitted during the freeze-thaw cycles. The results highlight the importance of gaseous carbon efflux in the estimation of carbon flux from peatlands, as well as the contribution of carbon efflux during the snow-covered season.

AB We present a record of peatland development during the last 1000 years from Mauntschas mire in the eastern Swiss Alps (Upper Engadine valley; 1818 m a.s.l.) inferred from testate amoebae (pH and depth to the water table (DWT) reconstructions), stable oxygen isotopes in Sphagnum (delta O-18; proxy for water vapour pressure) and carbon isotopes in Sphagnum (delta C-13; proxy for mire surface wetness), peat accumulation rates, charcoal (indicating local burning), pollen and spores (proxies for human impact), and plant macrofossils (reflecting local vegetation and trophic state). Past human impact on the local mire conditions was strong but fluctuating during AD 1000-1570 (+/- 50 yr; depth-age model based on 29 C-14 AMS dates) with local irrigation of nutrient-enriched water and grazing. Human impact was minor AD 1570-1830 (+/- 30 yr) with partial recovery of the local mire vegetation, and it was absent AD 1830 (+/- 30 yr)-present when hummock formation took place. Correlations among DWT, pH, delta C-13, and delta O-18, carried out both with the raw data and with linear trends removed, suggest that the factors driving peatland development changed over time, since only testate amoeba-based pH and DWT co-varied during all the three aforementioned periods. delta O-18 correlates with delta C-13 only in the period AD 1830-present and with DWT only during AD 1570-1830, delta C-13 correlates with DWT only during AD 1000-1570. Part of this apparent instability among the four time series might be attributed to shifts in the local mire conditions which potentially formed very different (non-analogue) habitats. Lack of analogues, caused, for example, by pre-industrial human impact, might have introduced artefacts in the reconstructions, since those habitats are not well represented in some proxy transfer functions. Human impact was probably the main factor for peatland development, distorting most of the climate signals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We determined evapotranspiration in three experiments designed to study the effects of elevated CO2 and increased N deposition on ombrotrophic bog vegetation. Two experiments used peat monoliths with intact bog vegetation in containers, with one experiment outdoors and the other in a greenhouse. A third experiment involved monocultures and mixtures of Sphagnum magellanicum and Eriophorum angustifolium in containers in the same greenhouse. To determine water use of the bog vegetation in July-August for each experiment and each year we measured water inputs and outputs from the containers. We studied the effects of elevated CO2 and N supply on evapotranspiration in relation to vascular plant biomass and exposure of the moss surface (measured as height of the moss surface relative to the container edge).
   Elevated CO2 reduced water use of the bog vegetation in all three experiments, but the CO2 effect on evapotranspiration interacted with vascular plant biomass and exposure of the moss surface. Evapotranspiration in the outdoor experiment was largely determined by evaporation from the Sphagnum moss surface (as affected by exposure to wind) and less so by vascular plant transpiration. Nevertheless, elevated CO2 significantly reduced evapotranspiration by 9-10% in the outdoor experiment.
   Vascular plants reduced evapotranspiration in the outdoor experiment, but increased water use in the greenhouse experiments. The relation between vascular plant abundance and evapotranspiration appears to depend on wind conditions; suggesting that vascular plants reduce water losses mainly by reducing wind speed at the moss surface.
   Sphagnum growth is very sensitive to changes in water level; low water availability can have deleterious effects. As a consequence, reduced evapotranspiration in summer, whether caused by elevated CO2 or by small increases in vascular plant cover, is expected to favour Sphagnum growth in ombrotrophic bog vegetation.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O), a major greenhouse gas and ozone depleter, is emitted from drained organic soils typically developed in floodplains. We investigated the effect of the water table depth and soil oxygen (O-2) content on N2O fluxes and their nitrogen isotope composition in a drained floodplain fen in Estonia. Measurements were done at natural water table depth, and we created a temporary anoxic environment by experimental flooding. From the suboxic peat (0.5-6 mg O-2/L) N2O emissions peaked at 6 mg O-2/L and afterwards decreased with decreasing O-2. From the anoxic and oxic peat (0 and >6 mg O-2/L, respectively) N2O emissions were low. Under anoxic conditions the delta N-15/delta N-14 ratio of the top 10 cm peat layer was low, gradually decreasing to 30 cm. In the suboxic peat, delta N-15/delta N-14 ratios increased with depth. In samples of peat fluctuating between suboxic and anoxic, the elevated N-15/N-14 ratios (delta N-15 = 7-9 parts per thousand. ambient N-2) indicated intensive microbial processing of nitrogen. Low values of site preference (SP; difference between the central and peripheral N-15 atoms) and delta O-18-N2O in the captured gas samples indicate nitrifier denitrification in the floodplain fen.

AB The northern wetlands are one of the major sources of methane into the atmosphere. We measured annual methane emission from a boreal minerotrophic fen, Siikaneva, by the eddy covariance method. The average wintertime emissions were below 1 mg m(-2) h(-1), and the summertime emissions about 3.5 mg m(-2) h(-1). The water table depth did have any clear effect on methane emissions. During most of the year the emission depended on the temperature of peat below the water table. However, during the high and late summer the emission was independent on peat temperature as well. No diurnal cycle of methane flux was found. The total annual emission from the Siikaneva site was 12.6 g m(-2). The emissions of the snow free period contributed 91% to the annual emission. The emission pulse during the snow melting period was clearly detectable but of minor importance adding only less than 3% to the annual emission. Over 20% of the carbon assimilated during the year as carbon dioxide was emitted as methane. Thus methane emission is an important component of the carbon balance of the Siikaneva fen. This indicates need of taking methane into account when studying carbon balances of northern fen ecosystems.

AB Peatlands are recognised as an important but vulnerable ecological resource. Understanding the effects of existing damage, in this case erosion, enables more informed land management decisions to be made. Over the growing seasons of 2013 and 2014 photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration were measured using closed chamber techniques within vegetated haggs and erosional peat pans in Dartmoor National Park, southwest England. Below-ground total and heterotrophic respiration were measured and autotrophic respiration estimated from the vegetated haggs. The mean water table was significantly higher in the peat pans than in the vegetated haggs; because of this, and the switching from submerged to dry peat, there were differences in vegetation composition, photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration. In the peat pans photosynthetic CO2 uptake and ecosystem respiration were greater than in the vegetated haggs and strongly dependent on the depth to water table (r(2)>0.78, p<0.001). Whilst in the vegetated haggs, photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration had the strongest relationships with normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) (r(2)=0.82, p<0.001) and soil temperature at 15cm depth (r(2)=0.77, p=0.001). Autotrophic and total below-ground respiration in the vegetated haggs varied with soil temperature; heterotrophic respiration increased as water tables fell. An empirically derived net ecosystem model estimated that over the two growing seasons both the vegetated haggs (29 and 20gCm(-2); 95% confidence intervals of -570 to 762 and -873 to 1105 gCm(-2)) and the peat pans (7 and 8gCm(-2); 95% confidence intervals of -147 to 465 and -136 to 436gCm(-2)) were most likely net CO2 sources. This study suggests that not only the visibly degraded bare peat pans but also the surrounding vegetated haggs are losing carbon to the atmosphere, particularly during warmer and drier conditions, highlighting a need for ecohydrological restoration.

AB Carbon stable isotope (delta C-13) records from vascular plant dominated peatlands have been used as a palaeoclimate proxy, but a better empirical understanding of fractionation processes in these ecosystems is required. Here, we test the potential of delta C-13 analysis of ombrotrophic restiad peatlands in New Zealand, dominated by the wire rush (Empodisma spp.), to provide a methodology for developing palaeoclimatic records. We took surface plant samples alongside measurements of water table depth and (micro) climate over spatial (six sites spanning > 10 degrees latitude) and temporal (monthly measurements over 1 year) gradients and analysed the relationships between cellulose delta C-13 values and environmental parameters. We found strong, significant negative correlations between delta C-13 and temperature, photosynthetically active radiation and growing degree days above 0 degrees C. No significant relationships were observed between delta C-13 and precipitation, relative humidity, soil moisture or water table depth, suggesting no growing season water limitation and a decoupling of the expected link between delta C-13 in vascular plants and hydrological variables. delta C-13 of Empodisma spp. roots may therefore provide a valuable temperature proxy in a climatically sensitive region, but further physiological and sub-fossil calibration studies are required to fully understand the observed signal.

AB Proxy climate data can be obtained from reconstructions of hydrological changes on ombrotrophic (rain-fed) peatlands using biological indicators, such as testate amoebae. Reconstructions are based on transfer functions, relating modern assemblage composition to water table and moisture content, applied to fossil sequences. Existing transfer functions in Europe and elsewhere are limited geographically and there are often problems with missing or poor analogues. This paper presents a new palaeohydrological transfer function based on sampling raised mires from across Europe. Relationships between assemblages and hydrological variables are described using ordination analyses. Transfer functions are developed for depth to water table (n = 119) and moisture content (n = 132) with root mean squared errors (RMSEP) of 5.6 cm and 2.7% respectively. Both transfer functions have an r(2) of 0.71, based on 'leave one out' cross-validation. Comparisons with an existing transfer function for Britain show that the European transfer function performs well in inferring measured water tables in Britain but that the British data cannot be used to infer water tables for other European sites with confidence. Several of the key missing and poor analogue taxa problems encountered in previous transfer functions are solved. The new transfer function will be an important tool in developing peat-based palaeoclimatic reconstructions for European sites. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Northern peatlands contain an estimated 1/3 of the world's soil carbon pool. This large carbon pool is of concern due to its uncertain future in a changing climate. Blanket bogs are peatlands that occur in temperate maritime regions where precipitation is much greater than evapotranspiration. We describe five years (1 October 2002 to 30 September 2007) of eddy-covariance (EC) carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements in an Atlantic blanket bog in Ireland. The measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was partitioned into its components of ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross ecosystem production (GEP). The inter-annual variation of the CO2 fluxes was investigated using correlation coefficient analyses with measured hydro-meteorological parameters. The annual NEE was negative for all five years (thus the peatland was a sink of CO2), ranging between -16.5 +/- 5.1 and -96.5 +/- 23.2 g C-CO2 m(-2) (average of -54.9 +/- 15.6 g C-CO2 m(-2)). During the study period, NEE was negative for the same five months in each year (May-September). NEE showed the highest CO2 uptake (due to the highest GEP) in the summer with intermediate rather than extreme meteorological conditions, thus with low vapour pressure deficit, intermediate soil water content, air temperature and light radiation, which might be partly explained by the role of the bryophyte community. Under climate change predictions of higher temperature, the inter-annual variation analysis suggests that ER might increase in winter. Furthermore, the predicted lower precipitation and higher temperature in the summer are expected to lead to lower GEP. The resulting increase in NEE (thus lower CO2 uptake) will be partly compensated by a higher GEP in warmer winters and in dryer autumns. Moreover, the CO2 uptake will benefit by a longer growing season, while wetter conditions will likely lower the ecosystem respiration in the spring. The length of the growing season was found to be driven by warmer winter and September soil temperatures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MIRES
AB This study evaluates the hydrological conditions in a harvested bog where various water management schemes have been implemented to ameliorate conditions limiting Sphagnum regeneration. The study sites included a natural bog (natural), a recently drained and harvested bog (drained), which provided the hydrological extremes. Also included are a drained harvested bog with ditches blocked with (1) no other management (blocked), (2) peat bounded by open water at 5-m intervals (5-m), and (3) with straw mulch on the surface (mulch).
   The study period from May to September 1995 was drier than normal. The water table in the drained site descended to -107 cm by late August, compared with -72.5 cm at the blocked site. Both the 5-m and mulch sites (ditches also blocked) had water table recessions similar to the natural site (minimum approx. 62 cm). In the drained and blocked sites, little variation in water table depth occurred after early July, suggesting water exchanges with the atmosphere occurred to and from the unsaturated zone only. Soil moisture in the upper 3 cm layer on the drained and blocked site were similar, in spite of greatly different water table depths, dropping below 20% by volume, compared with a minimum of 30% when mulch was used. Soil water tension profiles suggest most of this storage change occurred in the upper 30 cm. The water table depth, therefore, was not a good indicator of water availability at the surface.
   Pressure head in the unsaturated zone (1 cm below the surface) in the drained and blocked sites was maintained between 0 and -100 cm (mb) 18 and 34% of the time, respectively, and with water management with open water (5-m) and mulch, increased to 55 and 97% of the time, respectively. The greatest tension, however, was observed on the blocked site (-355 cm), rather than the drained site (-247 cm), suggesting lower suitability for Sphagnum at the former. This was attributed to the higher bulk density (hence smaller pore structure) at the blocked site (rho(b) = 92.1 kg compared with 55.7 kg m(-3)). Higher bulk density at the blocked site was ascribed to its longer time since disturbance. This implies' restoration should begin as soon as possible after harvesting is finished.

AB Testate amoebae are common proxy for water table depth in peatlands and are commonly used to reconstruct past hydroclimatic conditions. In northeastern America, previous transfer function development was mostly limited to ombrotrophic peatlands from continental and/or oceanic contexts. This study provides a greater range of modern analogues (n = 206) from ombrotrophic to poor minerotrophic peatlands along an ecoclimatic gradient from boreal to subarctic in both continental and oceanic regions. Multivariate analysis confirmed that water table depth is the dominant control on species distribution, and a new transfer function was developed for this environmental parameter. The WA.inv model has a RMSEP of 5.44 cm and R-2 of 0.80. The effect of spatial autocorrelation on the predictive power and statistical significance of this transfer function was also tested using newly developed statistical tests. We also improved modern analogues for two problematic species (Hyalophenia subflava and Difflugia pulex). This new testate amoeba transfer function will improve paleohydrological reconstructions from high-latitude peatlands (e.g. subarctic fens) and increase our ability to evaluate their sensitivity to ongoing climate change.

ID FLUORESCENT DYES; INFILTRATION; RAINFALL; SOILS
AB Global warming might change the hydrology of upland blanket peats in Britain. We have therefore studied in laboratory experiments the impact of drought on peat from the North Pennines of the UK. Runoff was dominated by surface and near-surface flow; flow decreased rapidly with depth and differed from one type of cover to another. Infiltration depended on the intensity of rain, and runoff responded rapidly to rain, with around 50% of rainwater emerging as overland flow. Drought changed the structure of the peat and the subsequent behaviour of the peat in response to rain. Surface runoff was reduced, infiltration increased and flow increased within the deeper peat layers. Old and new water produced from the peat during simulated storms was identified by bromide tracing; the amount of old mobile water flushed out of the top few centimetres was small and there was less from deeper peat layers. No significant difference in the old and new water mixing processes could be identified between the control plots and the drought treatment plots. Lissamine staining showed preferential bypass flow through macropores in the peat, though only in the top 5 cm. Following drought, however, macroporosity increased within the upper peat layers, and preferential flow extended deeper than in controls. Peat structure recovered somewhat after drought, but the effects of the drought were long-lasting. If these effects extend to the field during drier summers then we can expect changes to the hydrology and associated chemistry of blanket peat catchments in the British uplands.

AB Harvested sites rarely return to functional ecosystems after abandonment because drainage and peat extraction lower the water table and expose relatively decomposed peat, which is hydrologically unsuitable for Sphagnum moss reestablishment. Some natural regeneration of Sphagnum has occurred in isolated pockets on traditionally harvested (block-cut) sites, for reasons that are poorly understood, but are related to natural functions that regulate runoff and evaporation. This study evaluates the water balance of a naturally regenerated cutover bog and compares it with a nearby natural bog of similar size and origin, near Riviere du Loup, Quebec. Water balance results indicated that evapotranspiration was the major water loss from the harvested bog, comprising 92 and 84% of total outputs (2.9 mm day(-1)) during the 1997 and 1998 seasons, respectively. Despite denser tree cover at the harvested site, evapotranspiration from the natural bog was similar, although less spatially variable. At the harvested site, evaporative losses ranged from 1.9 mm day(-1) on raised baulks and roads to 3.6 mm day(-1) from moist surfaces with Sphagnum. Although about half of the ditches were:inactive or operating at only a fraction of their original efficiency, runoff was still significant at 12 and 24% of precipitation during the 1997 and 1998 study seasons, respectively. This compares with negligible rates of runoff at the natural bog. Thus the cutover bog, although abandoned over 25 years ago, has not regained its hydrological function. This is both a cause and effect of its inability to support renewed Sphagnum regeneration. Without suitable management (e.g. blocking ditches), this site is not likely to improve for a very long time. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Peatlands in the Western Boreal Plains act as important water sources in the landscape. Their persistence, despite potential evapotranspiration (PET) often exceeding annual precipitation, is attributed to various water storage mechanisms. One storage element that has been understudied is seasonal ground ice (SGI). This study characterized spring SGI conditions and explored its impacts on available energy, actual evapotranspiration, water table, and near surface soil moisture in a western boreal plains peatland. The majority of SGI melt took place over May 2017. Microtopography had limited impact on melt rates due to wet conditions. SGI melt released 139mm in ice water equivalent (IWE) within the top 30cm of the peat, and weak significant relationships with water table and surface moisture suggest that SGI could be important for maintaining vegetation transpiration during dry springs. Melting SGI decreased available energy causing small reductions in PET (<10mm over the melt period) and appeared to reduce actual evapotranspiration variability but not mean rates, likely due to slow melt rates. This suggests that melting SGI supplies water, allowing evapotranspiration to occur at near potential rates, but reduces the overall rate at which evapotranspiration could occur (PET). The role of SGI may help peatlands in headwater catchments act as a conveyor of water to downstream landscapes during the spring while acting as a supply of water for the peatland. Future work should investigate SGI influences on evapotranspiration under differing peatland types, wet and dry spring conditions, and if the spatial variability of SGI melt leads to spatial variability in evapotranspiration.

AB Riparian lowlands are known to control catchment nitrogen (N) balances. This study examined the role of agricultural tile drainage systems, often present in clay till landscapes, on the transport, transformation, and mass balance of N species in four riparian peat lowland transects receiving agricultural tile drainage water. Monitoring of N speciation of drain, stream, and groundwater, combined with a previously established water balance, enabled the determination of N mass balances for different flow paths including groundwater, subsurface drain water, and overland flow for each piezometer transect. The type of overland flow largely affected nitrate-N (NO3-N) removal efficiency, as determined by the total N output from a transect relative to the NO3-N loading (%). Infiltration and subsurface flow followed by exfiltration (short return flow) allowed an efficient removal of NO3-N (71-94%), while direct overland flow strongly lowered NO3-N removal (25%) in one transect. The hydraulic loading rate versus the lowland infiltration capacity determined the transport pathways and thus the resulting NO3-N removal efficiency. For all transects there was a net export of organic N and/or ammonium, associated with in situ N release from peat decomposition, through overland flow and groundwater discharge. These exports partly counterbalanced NO3-N removal and significantly reduced the overall total N removal for the riparian lowlands. However, the N removal efficiencies remained positive (1-56%). The study indicates that N budgets for riparian lowlands need to account for overland flow as a transport pathway for N.
   Key Points
   Nitrate (NO3-) removal in riparian lowlands (RLs) depends on the infiltration of NO3- into organic riparian lowland sediments. Direct overland flow, bypassing the RL soil and sediment, decreases nitrate removal. RLs may be sinks or sources of nitrogen (N) depending on the balance between removal of nitrate and release of ammonium and organic N.

AB Forest harvesting on peatland sites during the frost-free season often creates water-filled ruts and transfers more humified layers of peat to the surface. Foresters have generally assumed that such disturbance has negative consequences related to proliferation of graminoid vegetation, disruption of surface drainage leading to raised water tables and, possibly, reduced site productivity. An experiment was established during 1996 near Cochrane, Ontario to examine the physical impacts of site disturbance on peatlands. Summer traffic by forest harvesting equip ment was imposed at three intensities on a Black Spruce-Speckled Alder site type. The fractional area of surface disturbance increased with the amount of traffic, but disturbance effects on the thickness of the aerated zone, depth to the water table, and microtopography were not significant. However, the consistency of the effects produced by the most intense disturbance treatment suggests that it reduced average elevations and aerobic layer thicknesses, and increased water levels, by 2 to 6 cm, The hydrological effect of site disturbance in this study was small compared with the typical effect of forest canopy removal on water levels.

AB Emissions of CH4, CO2 and N2O from peat land soil have important implications for the atmospheric greenhouse gases balance. Till now, little is known about the patterns and controls of greenhouse gas from peatland soil where lied by permafrost in Northeast China. In the present study, soil GHG fluxes were observed over three years from a peatland in Great Hing'an Mountains. The results show that pronounced seasonal variation was observed in soil CH4 and CO2 fluxes during the measurement periods, but was not appeared in soil N2O fluxes. Seasonal dynamics of CO? emissions were strongly regulated by air temperature and soil temperature at 5 cm. On seasonal scale, the Q(10) of soil CO2 in spring was much higher than other seasons, which implied more CO2 emission to atmosphere under spring warming. We also found a negative relationship between soil CO2 fluxes and water table depth, with the emissions decreasing as water table approach to soil surface. The annual emissions of greenhouse gas from peatland soil were 641.13 g m(-2) yr(-1) for CO2, 0.65 g m(-2) yr(-1) for CH4 and 29.7 mg m(-2) yr(-1) for N2O, respectively. Our results suggest that peatland soil CO2 emission was more sensitive to climate change, especially warming.

AB Net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE) and its components, gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), were compared between a bog and an abandoned peatland pasture within the same peatland complex in western Newfoundland, Canada. Measurements based on the eddy covariance technique from April 2014 to April 2016 were used to examine the influence of agricultural management and abandonment on peatland carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange. NEE, GPP and ER at both sites showed pronounced seasonal variation, peaking near the middle growing season. The maximum net CO2 uptake rate of -28.61 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and emission rate of 14.39 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at the pasture were significantly higher than those at the bog (-9.67 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 5.50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively). Daytime average GPP was related to photosynthetic photon flux density and air temperature and the nighttime average ER decreased with soil water content, but increased with surface soil temperature for both sites. Annual NEE of the pasture (-128 +/- 60 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15 and -124 +/- 56 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015-16) was considerably larger than that of the bog (-46 +/- 36 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15). GPP of 1086 +/- 141 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15 and 982 +/- 123 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015-16 and ER of 957 129 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15 and 858 +/- 112 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015-16 at the pasture were approximately twice the magnitude of the corresponding fluxes at the bog. The difference in GPP between the bog and pasture was mainly related to their different aboveground biomass. Higher ER at the pasture was probably related to its lower water table depth, greater substrate availability and higher autotrophic respiration. Unlike previous findings that managed peat lands are large CO2 emitters, our results suggest that abandoned peatland pastures can function like natural grasslands and sequester considerable amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere.

AB This paper investigates the peat saturation and the air entrapment dynamics in a peatland, estimated from the water table fluctuations. A reservoirs model of water table fluctuations in a double-porosity peat is proposed, by calculating the stored water in effective porosity of the peat from precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets. Calculations conceptualize vascular plant consumption through a crop coefficient. Changes in water storage, located in the effective porosity of the peat, are described through a maximum infiltration rate and a maximum storage capacity. Water discharges take place in runoff and percolation reservoirs. The runoff coefficient is considered to be water table dependent. This model was tested on a peatland that has experienced strong water table fluctuations caused by summer drought and/or by vascular plant water consumption. A water table dependent runoff model appeared to be adequate to describe the water table fluctuations in peatland. From this model, vascular plants were found to increase the crop coefficient and to limit percolation through the peat. The high water table depth in winter was found to change with the years and is related to an equilibrium between slow infiltration in peat versus percolation plus evapotranspiration. In this disturbed peatland, even if overland flows occurred after a drought, the re-saturation of effective porosity was slow with about 30% of air trapped in the porosity 6 months after the drought period. The effects of a drought on peat saturation were observed over more than a single hydrological cycle. This can affect the biogeochemical processes controlling the C cycle in peatland.

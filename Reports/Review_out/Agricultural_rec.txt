THE INITIATIVE UNDERLINES THE ROLE OF SOIL ORGANIC MATTER (SOM) IN ADDRESSING THE THREE-FOLD CHALLENGE OF FOOD AND NUTRITIONAL SECURITY, ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND MITIGATION OF HUMAN-INDUCED GREENHOUSE GASES (GHGS) EMISSIONS. IT SETS AN AMBITIOUS ASPIRATIONAL TARGET OF A 4 PER 1000 (I.E. 0.4%) RATE OF ANNUAL INCREASE IN GLOBAL SOIL ORGANIC CARBON (SOC) STOCKS, WITH A FOCUS ON AGRICULTURAL LANDS WHERE FARMERS WOULD ENSURE THE CARBON STEWARDSHIP OF SOILS, LIKE THEY MANAGE DAY-TO-DAY MULTIPURPOSE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS IN A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. IN THIS PAPER, THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR THE 4 PER 1000 INITIATIVE ARE DISCUSSED. WE SHOW THAT THE 4 PER 1000 TARGET, CALCULATED RELATIVE TO GLOBAL TOP SOIL SOC STOCKS, IS CONSISTENT WITH LITERATURE ESTIMATES OF THE TECHNICAL POTENTIAL FOR SOC SEQUESTRATION, THOUGH THE ACHIEVABLE POTENTIAL IS LIKELY TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER GIVEN SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONSTRAINTS. WE CALCULATE THAT LAND-BASED NEGATIVE EMISSIONS FROM ADDITIONAL SOC SEQUESTRATION COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING THE ANTHROPOGENIC CO2 EQUIVALENT EMISSION GAP IDENTIFIED FROM NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS PLEDGED BY COUNTRIES TO STABILIZE GLOBAL WARMING LEVELS BELOW 2 DEGREES C OR EVEN 1.5 DEGREES C UNDER THE PARIS AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE. THE 4 PER 1000 TARGET COULD BE IMPLEMENTED BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT DIFFERENTIATED SOC STOCK BASELINES, REVERSING THE CURRENT TREND OF HUGE SOIL CO2 LOSSES, E.G. FROM AGRICULTURE ENCROACHING PEATLAND SOILS. WE FURTHER DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF SOC STEWARDSHIP FOR BOTH DEGRADED AND HEALTHY SOILS ALONG CONTRASTING SPATIAL SCALES (FIELD, FARM, LANDSCAPE AND COUNTRY) AND TEMPORAL (YEAR TO CENTURY) HORIZONS. LAST, WE PRESENT SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS RELATIVE TO NON-CO2 GHGS EMISSIONS, WATER AND NUTRIENTS USE AS WELL AS CO-BENEFITS FOR CROP YIELDS AND CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION. WE UNDERLINE THE CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON-PERMANENCE OF SOC STOCKS AND SHOW HOW THE RATES OF ADOPTION AND THE DURATION OF IMPROVED SOIL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES COULD ALTER THE GLOBAL IMPACTS OF PRACTICES UNDER THE 4 PER 1000 INITIATIVE. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE 4 PER 1000 INITIATIVE HAS POTENTIAL TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) OF THE 2030 AGENDA. IT CAN BE REGARDED AS NO-REGRET SINCE INCREASING SOC IN AGRICULTURAL SOILS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO FOOD SECURITY BENEFITS THAT WILL ENHANCE RESILIENCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. HOWEVER, SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFEGUARDS WILL BE NEEDED TO ENSURE AN EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 4 PER 1000 TARGET.","MATCHING POLICY AND SCIENCE: RATIONALE FOR THE '4 PER 1000-SOILS FOR FOOD SECURITY AND CLIMATE' INITIATIVE","SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH","ARTICLE","MAY",2019,"10.1016/j.still.2017.12.002","SOIL SCIENCE","WOS:000459520700002"

IN THIS STUDY, WE USED THREE OF THESE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES APPLIED TO THE CAMPANIAN PLAIN LOCATED IN SOUTHERN ITALY: SINTACS, AVI AND LOS. HOWEVER, THEIR CAPABILITY TO DESCRIBE THE OBSERVED CHEMICAL POLLUTION OF THE AREA HAS RESULTED QUITE POOR. FOR SUCH A REASON, A MODIFIED SINTACS METHOD HAS BEEN THEN IMPLEMENTED IN THE AREA IN ORDER TO GET A MORE RELIABLE VIEW OF GROUNDWATER VULNERABILITY. NO3- AND SO42- FROM MORE THAN 400 MONITORING WELLS WERE USED FOR SPECIFIC VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT. LAND USE WAS CHOSEN AS KEY PARAMETER TO INFER THE RISK OF GROUNDWATER POLLUTION IN OUR AREA. THE NEW METHODOLOGY SEEMS TO SHOW A HIGHER CORRELATION WITH OBSERVED NO3- CONCENTRATIONS AND A MORE RELIABLE IDENTIFICATION OF AQUIFER'S POLLUTION HOT SPOTS. THE MAIN SOURCES OF NO3- WERE FOUND IN SUB-URBAN AREAS, WHERE VULNERABILITY AND RISK ARE HIGHER THAN IN OTHER AREAS. OTHERWISE DUE TO REDUCING CONDITIONS TRIGGERED BY THE PRESENCE OF ELEVATED SEDIMENTARY ORGANIC MATTER AND PEAT, CONCENTRATIONS BELOW AGRICULTURAL AREAS WERE LOWER THAN IN SUB-URBAN AREAS. THE SO42- SPECIFIC VULNERABILITY MAP SHOWED A POSITIVE CORRELATION WITH OBSERVED CONCENTRATIONS, DUE TO GEOGENIC AND ANTHROPOGENIC SO42- SOURCES PRESENT IN THE AREA. THE COMBINATION OF BOTH NO3- AND SO42- DERIVED RISK MAPS BECOMES ESSENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF AQUIFER POLLUTION IN THIS SEVERELY ANTHROPIZED AREA. THE APPLICATION OF THIS NEW AND ORIGINAL APPROACH SHED LIGHT ON THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF EACH OF THE DESCRIBED PREVIOUS METHODS AND CLEARLY SHOWED HOW ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS.

MANY COASTAL PEATLANDS ARE DRAINED TO CREATE ARABLE LAND. THIS IS NOT WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES; PHYSICAL COMPACTION OF PEAT AND ITS DEGRADATION BY OXIDATION LEAD TO SUBSIDENCE, AND OXIDATION ALSO LEADS TO EMISSIONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2). THIS STUDY COMPLEMENTS EXISTING STUDIES BY QUANTIFYING TOTAL LAND SUBSIDENCE AND ASSOCIATED CO2 RESPIRATION OVER THE PAST MILLENNIUM IN THE DUTCH COASTAL PEATLANDS, TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO THE CONSEQUENCES OF CULTIVATING COASTAL PEATLANDS OVER LONGER TIMESCALES. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PEAT VOLUME LOSS WAS 19.8 KM(3), WHICH LOWERED THE DUTCH COASTAL PLAIN BY 1.9 M ON AVERAGE, BRINGING MOST OF IT BELOW SEA LEVEL. AT LEAST 66 % OF THE VOLUME REDUCTION IS THE RESULT OF DRAINAGE, AND 34 % WAS CAUSED BY THE EXCAVATION AND SUBSEQUENT COMBUSTION OF PEAT. THE ASSOCIATED CO2 RESPIRATION IS EQUIVALENT TO A GLOBAL ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATION INCREASE OF SIMILAR TO 0.39 PPMV. CULTIVATION OF COASTAL PEATLANDS CAN TURN A CARBON SINK INTO A CARBON SOURCE. IF THE PATH TAKEN BY THE DUTCH WOULD BE FOLLOWED WORLDWIDE, THERE WILL BE DOUBLE TROUBLE: GLOBALLY SIGNIFICANT CARBON EMISSIONS AND INCREASED FLOOD RISK IN A GLOBALLY IMPORTANT HUMAN HABITAT. THE EFFECTS WOULD BE LARGER THAN THE HISTORIC ONES BECAUSE MOST OF THE CUMULATIVE DUTCH SUBSIDENCE AND PEAT LOSS WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH MUCH LESS EFFICIENT TECHNIQUES THAN THOSE AVAILABLE NOW.","DOUBLE TROUBLE: SUBSIDENCE AND CO2 RESPIRATION DUE TO 1,000 YEARS OF DUTCH COASTAL PEATLANDS CULTIVATION","HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL","ARTICLE","MAY",2016,"10.1007/s10040-016-1380-4","GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY; WATER RESOURCES","WOS:000374973500002"

OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATED CONSERVATIVE MIXING OF DOC FROM PEATLAND AND MOUNTAIN WATERS BUT INTERACTIVE EFFECTS WHEN PEATLAND WATER WAS MIXED WITH AGRICULTURAL AND ESTUARY WATERS AND EXPOSED TO SOLAR RADIATION. THE MIXING OF PEATLAND AND AGRICULTURAL WATERS LED TO NET DOC PRODUCTION, SUGGESTING THAT DOC WAS ONLY PARTIALLY DEGRADED BY SOLAR RADIATION AND THAT THE PRODUCTS OF THIS MIGHT HAVE FUELLED AUTOTROPHIC MICROBIAL GROWTH IN THE SAMPLES. THE MIXING OF PEATLAND WATER WITH SALINE ESTUARY WATER RESULTED IN NET DOC LOSS FOLLOWING IRRADIATION, SUGGESTING A ROLE FOR SUNLIGHT IN ENHANCING THE FLOCCULATION OF DOC TO PARTICULATE ORGANIC CARBON (POC) IN SALINE ENVIRONMENTS.","TRANSFORMATIONS IN DOC ALONG A SOURCE TO SEA CONTINUUM; IMPACTS OF PHOTO-DEGRADATION, BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND MIXING","AQUATIC SCIENCES","ARTICLE","JUL",2016,"10.1007/s00027-015-0461-0","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; LIMNOLOGY; MARINE & FRESHWATER BIOLOGY","WOS:000377360200003"

CO2 AND CH4. ABOUT A THIRD OF ANTHROPOGENIC GHGS ARE PRODUCED FROM AGRICULTURE, INCLUDING LIVESTOCK FARMING AND HORTICULTURE. A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE UK'S HORTICULTURAL FARMING TAKES PLACE ON DRAINED LOWLAND PEATLANDS, WHICH ARE A SOURCE OF SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CO2 INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. THIS STUDY SET OUT TO ESTABLISH WHETHER TAISING THE WATER TABLE FROM THE CURRENTLY USED 50 CM TO 30 CM COULD REDUCE GHGS EMISSIONS FROM AGRICULTURAL PEATLANDS, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY MAINTAINING THE CURRENT LEVELS OF HORTICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY. A FACTORIAL DESIGN EXPERIMENT USED AGRICULTURAL PEAT SOIL COLLECTED FROM THE NORFOLK FENS (AMONG THE LARGEST OF THE UK'S LOWLAND PEATLANDS UNDER INTENSIVE CULTIVATION) TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF WATER TABLE LEVELS, ELEVATED CO2, AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION ON GHG FLUXES AND CROP PRODUCTIVITY OF RADISH, ONE OF THE MOST ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT FENLAND CROPS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHOW THAT A WATER TABLE OF 30 CM CAN INCREASE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE RADISH CROP WHILE ALSO REDUCING SOIL CO2 EMISSIONS BUT WITHOUT A RESULTANT LOSS OF CH4 TO THE ATMOSPHERE, UNDER BOTH AMBIENT AND ELEVATED CO2 CONCENTRATIONS. ELEVATED CO2 INCREASED DRY SHOOT BIOMASS, BUT NOT BULB BIOMASS NOR ROOT BIOMASS, SUGGESTING NO IMMEDIATE ADVANTAGE OF FUTURE CO2 LEVELS TO HORTICULTURAL FARMING ON PEAT SOILS.

THE HIGHEST ORGANIC CARBON EXPORT ORIGINATED FROM PEAT DOMINATED CATCHMENTS, WHEREAS RIVERS DRAINING AGRICULTURAL CATCHMENTS HAD THE HIGHEST AREA-SPECIFIC INORGANIC CARBON FLUXES. BETWEEN 1975 AND 2014 TOTAL INORGANIC CARBON (TIC) CONCENTRATIONS ROSE MORE STEADILY THAN THE RESPECTIVE TOC CONCENTRATIONS. THERE WAS AN OVERALL DECREASE IN TOC CONCENTRATIONS BETWEEN 1975 AND THE MID-1990S. DECREASED POINT SOURCE LOADING CONTRIBUTED TO THIS PATTERN, ALTHOUGH DECREASES WERE ALSO DETECTED IN RIVERS WITHOUT ANY MAJOR POLLUTION SOURCES. FROM THE MID-1990S TOC CONCENTRATIONS STARTED TO RISE AND THE INCREASE WAS EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED THAN THE EARLIER DECREASE.

WARMING CLIMATE, CHANGES IN HYDROLOGY AND DECREASES IN ACIDIC DEPOSITION WERE THE MAJOR DRIVING FACTORS ALTHOUGH THEIR CONTRIBUTION VARIED GEOGRAPHICALLY. AT THE SAME TIME BOTH TOC AND TIC EXPORT INCREASED SLIGHTLY, BUT THE STRONG UPWARD TRENDS IN TOC CONCENTRATIONS WERE NOT REFLECTED AS CLEARLY IN TOC EXPORT TRENDS.

THE UPTAKE PEAK OF THE OAT FIELD IS MUCH LATER THAN THAT OF THE GRASSLAND, BUT LARGER DUE TO A RAPID PLANT GROWTH.

OUT OF THE 20 WELLS, NOTABLE UPWARD TRENDS WERE SIGNIFICANT (>95% LEVEL) FOR THE TOTAL HARDNESS (30%), TOTAL ALKALINITY (20%), TDS (15%), FE2+ (15%), MN2+ (15%), NO2- (10%), AND 10% FOR THE NH4+, PO43-, AND SIO2. ATTENUATION RATES (MG/L/YEAR) WERE HIGHER IN NH4+ (AV. 0.023) THAN MN2+ (AV. 0.013) AND FE+2 (AV. 0.010), AND REMARKABLE AVERAGE RATES WERE 6.77 (TDS), 3.27 (TOTAL ALKALINITY), 2.12 (TOTAL HARDNESS), 0.79 (SIO2), 0.011 (PO43-), AND 0.002 (NO2-) IN DECREASING ORDER. HIGH PRECISION OF THE TREND ESTIMATE WAS CONFIRMED FOR THE MN2+, NH4+, AND FE2+ DATA. FIVE FACTORS WERE FOUND TO EXPLAIN 78.8% OF THE TOTAL VARIANCE OF THE QUALITY VARIABLES AND IN PARTICULAR, A SIGNIFICANT LOAD OF HARDNESS PARAMETERS, TOTAL ALKALINITY, TDS, MN2+, NH4+, AND FE2+ IN DECREASING ORDER WERE IDENTIFIED.

GEOLOGICAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THESE SEA INGRESSIONS (EXPANSION OF NEW TIDAL SYSTEMS) WERE MAINLY CAUSED BY LAND SUBSIDENCE, WHICH OCCURRED DUE TO INTENSIFIED AGRICULTURAL USE OF ARTIFICIALLY DRAINED PEATLANDS SINCE THE LATE IRON AGE (250-12 BC). THIS MADE THE COASTAL PLAIN SENSITIVE TO STORM-SURGE INGRESSION THROUGH WEAK SPOTS, E.G., AT THE LOCATION OF EXISTING CREEKS, IN THE COASTLINE. USING THE NETHERLANDS AS A CASE STUDY, WE SHOW THAT NATURAL PRECONDITIONS (I.E., THE GEOLOGICAL SETTING AT THE TIME OF INGRESSION) PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE PACING AND EXTENT OF TIDAL AREA EXPANSION. INGRESSIVE TIDAL SYSTEMS EVENTUALLY REACHED MOST FAR INLAND IN COASTAL SEGMENTS WITH WIDE PEATY BACK-BARRIER PLAINS. IN CONTRAST, SEA INGRESSION FORMATION WAS HAMPERED IN COASTAL SEGMENTS WITH WELL-DEVELOPED NATURAL INGRESSION-PROTECTING GEOMORPHIC FEATURES (E.G., BEACH-BARRIERS, SUPRATIDAL LEVEES). FEEDBACK MECHANISMS, SUCH AS ADDITIONAL PEAT SUBSIDENCE BY LOADING OF SEDIMENT IMPORTED INTO THE NEW TIDAL AREA, CAUSED FURTHER TIDAL VOLUME INCREASE AND CREATED ACCOMMODATION SPACE FOR TIDAL DEPOSITS. THESE COMBINED EFFECTS CAUSED IRREVERSIBLE SEA INGRESSION OVER LARGE AREAS THAT CONSEQUENTLY BECAME UNSUITABLE FOR HABITATION FOR MANY CENTURIES. IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF SUCH SEA-INGRESSION MECHANISMS AND THEIR FACILITATING CONDITIONS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF THE SENSITIVITY OF MANY DENSELY POPULATED COASTAL PLAINS, WHICH EXPERIENCE MAJOR HUMAN-INDUCED SUBSIDENCE, EVENTUALLY LEADING TO COASTAL PLAIN DROWNING.

ALTHOUGH THE FACTS ARE WELL KNOWN, THE POLICIES LEADING TO DIMINISHED EMISSIONS ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT. WE HAVE ANALYSED THE REASONS WHY THE MITIGATION POTENTIAL IS NOT FULLY UTILIZED AND WHAT COULD BE DONE BETTER IN NATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION OF CLIMATE POLICIES. FOUR CASES ARE USED TO ILLUSTRATE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO REACH MITIGATION TARGETS: DETERMINING THE AMOUNT AND PROPERTIES OF PEAT SOILS, ESTIMATING THE POTENTIAL, COSTS AND FEASIBILITY OF THE MITIGATION MEASURES, AND SELECTING AND IMPLEMENTING THE BEST MEASURES. A COMMON FEATURE FOR ALL OF THE CASES WAS THAT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE POLICIES HAVE INCREASED THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN GHG EMISSIONS FROM PEAT SOILS AND INCREASED THE PRESSURE FOR MITIGATION. BASICALLY THE SAME FACTORS RESTRICT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MITIGATION MEASURES IN ALL COUNTRIES WITH SIGNIFICANT PEAT SOIL AREAS. THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE IS LACK OF POLICY COHERENCE, E.G. IGNORING CLIMATE POLICIES WHEN PLANNING LAND USE OR AGRICULTURAL POLICIES. WE CONCLUDE THAT GHG MITIGATION IS ACHIEVED ONLY IF OTHER POLICIES, ESPECIALLY NATIONAL REGULATIONS AND STRATEGIES, ARE IN LINE WITH CLIMATE POLICIES.

AGRICULTURE ON REWETTED PEATLANDS (PALUDICULTURE) PROVIDES A SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVE TO DRAINAGE-BASED AGRICULTURE. ONE FORM OF PALUDICULTURE IS THE CULTIVATION OF SPHAGNUM MOSS, WHICH CAN BE USED AS A RAW MATERIAL FOR HORTICULTURAL GROWING MEDIA. UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS, MOST SPHAGNUM MOSSES ELIGIBLE FOR PALUDICULTURE TYPICALLY PREDOMINATE ONLY IN NUTRIENT-POOR WETLAND HABITATS. IT IS UNKNOWN, HOWEVER, HOW THE PREVAILING HIGH NUTRIENT LEVELS IN REWETTED AGRICULTURAL PEATLANDS INTERFERE WITH OPTIMAL SPHAGNUM PRODUCTION. WE THEREFORE STUDIED THE EFFECT OF ENRICHED NUTRIENT CONDITIONS REMAINING EVEN AFTER TOP SOIL REMOVAL AND FURTHER CAUSED BY EXTERNAL SUPPLY OF NUTRIENT-RICH IRRIGATION WATER AND (GENERALLY) HIGH INPUTS OF ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN (N) TO HABITAT BIOGEOCHEMISTRY, BIOMASS PRODUCTION AND NUTRIENT STOICHIOMETRY OF INTRODUCED SPHAGNUM PALUSTRE AND S. PAPILLOSUM IN A REWETTED PEATLAND, WHICH WAS FORMERLY IN INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL USE. AIRBORNE N WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAJOR SUPPLY OF N. PHOSPHORUS (P) AND POTASSIUM (K) WERE MAINLY SUPPLIED BY IRRIGATION WATER. THE PREVAILING HIGH NUTRIENT LEVELS (P AND K) ARE A RESULT OF NUTRIENT-RICH IRRIGATION WATER FROM THE SURROUNDINGS. PEAT POREWATER (10 CM BELOW PEATMOSS SURFACE) CO2 CONCENTRATIONS WERE HIGH, BICARBONATE CONCENTRATIONS LOW, AND THE PH WAS AROUND 4.2. PROVIDED THAT MOISTURE SUPPLY IS SUFFICIENT AND DOMINANCE OF FAST-GROWING, LARGER GRAMINOIDS SUPPRESSED (IN ORDER TO AVOID OUTSHADING OF SPHAGNUM MOSSES), STRIKINGLY VERY HIGH BIOMASS YIELDS OF 6.7 AND 6.5 T DW HA(-1) YR(-1) (S, PALUSTRE AND S.

FALLAX) AT THE EXPENSE OF SLOWER GROWING BUT PREFERRED PEATMOSSES AS HORTICULTURAL SUBSTRATE (S. PALUSTRE AND S. PAPILLOSUM) TO OPTIMIZE THE QUALITY OF BIOMASS YIELDS. IN CONCLUSION, SPHAGNUM FARMING IS WELL ABLE TO THRIVE UNDER HIGH N INPUT PROVIDED THAT THERE IS A SIMULTANEOUS HIGH INPUT OF P AND K FROM IRRIGATION WATER, WHICH FACILITATES HIGH PRODUCTION RATES. DUE TO THE LACK OF SUITABLE, NUTRIENT POOR SITES, IT SEEMS TO BE USEFUL TO REMOVE THE TOPSOIL (MAINLY P REMOVAL) PRIOR TO START GROWING SPHAGNUM MOSSES. IN ADDITION, BICARBONATE CONCENTRATIONS HAVE TO STAY SUFFICIENTLYLOW TO ENSURE A LOW PH, CO2 SUPPLY FROM THE PEAT SOIL SHOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY HIGH TO PREVENT C LIMITATION, AND GRAMINOIDS SHOULD BE MOWN REGULARLY.

OVER A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS THE ALMOST SATURATED SOIL COLUMNS WERE DRAINED STEPWISE VIA SUCTION TO -300 HPA. THE CO2 FLUXES WERE LOWEST AT WATER-SATURATED AND DRY SOIL MOISTURE CONDITIONS, RESULTING IN A PARABOLIC DEPENDENCE OF CO2 FLUXES ON THE WATER-FILLED PORE SPACE (WFPS) PEAKING AT 56-92% WFPS. THE HIGHEST N2O FLUXES WERE FOUND AT BETWEEN 73 AND 95% WFPS.

NO SYSTEMATIC INFLUENCE OF PEAT TYPE OR SAND ADDITION ON GHG EMISSIONS WAS FOUND IN TOPSOILS, BUT CO2 FLUXES FROM SUBSOILS BELOW PEAT-SAND MIXTURES WERE HIGHER THAN FROM SUBSOILS BELOW EARTHIFIED PEAT.

SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF SUCH SOILS IS CONTINGENT UPON IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF THEIR MANAGEMENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT. IN THIS CONTEXT, WE REPORT THE FIRST ANNUAL BUDGET OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM TEMPERATE PEAT SOILS UNDER INTENSIVE HORTICULTURAL PRODUCTION.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL CONTROLS ON DOC CONCENTRATIONS IN A PEAT -SAND MIXTURE BY MEANS OF A SATURATED COLUMN EXPERIMENT WITH UNDISTURBED COLUMNS. THE SOIL CAME FROM A FORMER BOG IN NORTHERN GERMANY WHERE PEAT LAYERS REMAINING AFTER PEAT EXTRACTION WERE MIXED WITH THE UNDERLYING MINERAL SOIL BY PLOUGHING.

THE TRANSPORT PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL WERE OBTAINED BY ANALYSING BREAKTHROUGH CURVES OF POTASSIUM BROMIDE USING THE TRANSPORT MODEL STANMOD, WHICH IS BASED ON THE TWO -REGION NON -EQUILIBRIUM CONCEPT. THE RESULTS OF THE COLUMN STUDY WERE COMPARED TO DOC CONCENTRATIONS MEASURED BI-WEEKLY FOR TWO YEARS AT THE FIELD SITE FROM WHERE THE COLUMNS WERE TAKEN. DESPITE A SIMILAR TEXTURE AND SOIL ORGANIC CARBON (SOC) CONTENT, THE FRACTION OF THE MOBILE ZONE IN THE COLUMNS VARIED BETWEEN 51% AND 100% OF TOTAL POROSITY. THUS EVEN HEAVILY DEGRADED ORGANIC SOILS MIXED WITH SAND STILL SHOWED A DUAL POROSITY COMPARABLE TO DEGRADED PEAT SOILS. PERCOLATING THE COLUMNS WITH THE HIGH EC SOLUTION CAUSED LOW PH VALUES, PROBABLY DUE TO ION EXCHANGE AND CATION BRIDGING. THE COMBINATION OF HIGH EC AND LOW PH GREATLY DECREASED DOC CONCENTRATIONS AT THE OUTLET OF THE COLUMNS. DOC CONCENTRATIONS DECREASED AND FLUXES INCREASED AS THE PUMPING RATES INCREASED. TAKING PORE WATER VELOCITY IN THE MOBILE ZONE INTO ACCOUNT COULD HELP TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COLUMNS. OVERALL, TRANSPORT OF DOC DID NOT SEEM TO BE LIMITED BY PRODUCTION OF DOC, BUT BY RATE -LIMITED EXCHANGE PROCESSES. IN CONTRAST TO THE COLUMN EXPERIMENT, FIELD CONCENTRATIONS OF DOC WERE MUCH HIGHER AND WERE NOT RELATED TO PH, BUT INCREASED WITH HIGHER ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY.

TO DATE WE HAVE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THESE INTERVENTIONS INFLUENCE THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES IN PEATLANDS. WE COMPARED THE RESPONSES OF DOMINANT MICROBIAL CONSUMERS (TESTATE AMOEBAE) TO DRAINAGE DITCH RESTORATION RELATIVE TO UNBLOCKED DITCHES IN A UK UPLAND BLANKET PEATLAND (MIGNEINT, NORTH WALES). TWO TECHNIQUES WERE USED FOR RESTORATION: (I) DAMMED DITCHES WITH RE-PROFILING; AND (II) DAMMED DITCHES WITH POOLS OF OPEN WATER BEHIND EACH DAM.

THEREFORE, AN OPTIMIZATION MODEL AT THE FARM LEVEL THAT INCLUDES THE EMISSIONS FROM ALL RELEVANT SOURCES IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS IS USED.

THESE RESULTS CONTRAST WITH THE TREND OF COASTAL-DELTAIC SUBSIDENCE IN OTHER DELTAS, WITH CITIES SUBSIDING FASTER THAN AGRICULTURAL AREAS.

ON 30% (49,929 HA), BOTH CROPPING AND PERMANENT GRASSLAND PALUDICULTURE TYPES ARE POSSIBLE DEPENDING ON ADMINISTRATIVE CHECK. ON 17% (28,827 HA), NATURE CONSERVATION RESTRICTIONS ALLOW ONLY PERMANENT GRASSLAND PALUDICULTURE.

THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF MINERAL MATTER CONTENT ON THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY (LAMBDA) IN PARTIALLY FROZEN AND UNFROZEN PEAT SAMPLES. EFFECT OF CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE FROM -3 DEGREES C TO - 10 DEGREES C ON THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY WAS ALSO ESTIMATED. THREE EXISTING MODELS FOR ESTIMATING THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF ORGANIC SOILS WERE ASSESSED FOR THEIR SUITABILITY FOR CULTIVATED DRAINED PEAT SOILS.

THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT X VALUES DIFFERED BETWEEN PEAT SOILS DEPENDING ON MINERAL MATTER CONTENT, ICE CONTENT AND MOISTURE CONTENT. THE SAMPLES WITH THE HIGHEST MINERAL MATTER CONTENT AND BULK DENSITY HAD HIGHER THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY AT POSITIVE TEMPERATURES AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, AT FREEZING TEMPERATURES, WHEN VOLUMETRIC WATER CONTENT AND VOLUME OF WATER-FREE PORES WAS SIMILAR.

WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE ABUNDANT PRESENCE OF GRAY BIRCH IS A RELATIVELY RECENT PHENOMENON ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE CREATING CONDITIONS FAVORABLE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS SPECIES. WE ANALYZED DENDROCHRONOLOGICAL, PLANT-MACROFOSSIL, AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS AND CLIMATIC DATA FOR 10 SITES. ALL OF THE PEATLANDS RECENTLY EXPERIENCED A MAJOR INCREASE IN FOREST COVER. THE FIRST SIGN OF GRAY BIRCH ESTABLISHMENT DATES BACK TO THE 1950S, ALTHOUGH AT OVER HALF OF SITES, ESTABLISHMENT TOOK PLACE AFTER 1980. ABUNDANT MACROREMAINS OF THE SPECIES WERE FOUND ONLY IN THE UPPER PORTION OF PEAT DEPOSITS. BIRCH ENCROACHMENT MOST OFTEN OCCURRED AFTER A FIRE HAD SPREAD THROUGH THE PEATLAND.

COMPARED WITH MINERAL SOILS, OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES OF PEAT SOILS IS LIMITED, ESPECIALLY OF THE TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF PEAT PROPERTIES. A DATA SET OF PEAT SUBSIDENCE AS WELL AS THE BULK DENSITY (BD) CHANGE RATE FOLLOWING ARTIFICIAL DRAINAGE WAS ASSEMBLED FROM THE LITERATURE. THE COLLECTED DATA COVER A TIME PERIOD OF UP TO 272 YEARS OF LAND DRAINAGE FOR FORESTRY AND AGRICULTURE IN BOREAL AND TEMPERATE CLIMATE ZONES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SUBSIDENCE RATE AND BD CHANGE RATE, AND HYDROPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF PEAT CAN BE ESTIMATED BASED ON LAND DRAINAGE DURATION AND LAND USE. THE MOST SEVERE SHIFT IN PORE STRUCTURE OF PEAT OCCURS WITHIN THE FIRST 20 YEARS OF LAND DRAINAGE. PEATLAND DRAINAGE REDUCES MACROPOROSITY WITH PORE DIAMETER GREATER THAN 50 MU M, BUT INCREASES THE VOLUME OF PORES <5 MU M. IN THE LONG TERM, PEAT THICKNESS LOSS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN 80% OF WATER STORAGE LOSS. IN CONCLUSION, THE DERIVED FUNCTIONS BETWEEN SUBSIDENCE RATE, BD CHANGE RATE, AND DRAINAGE DURATION PROVIDE A NEW APPROACH TO ESTIMATE THE HYDROPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF PEAT (PORE STRUCTURE, SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY, SPECIFIC YIELD, AND SOIL WATER STORAGE) ON A CENTENNIAL SCALE.

SOIL-ATMOSPHERE GHG EXCHANGE, GHG CONCENTRATIONS WITHIN THE PEAT PROFILE AND SOIL WATER SOLUTE CONCENTRATIONS WERE MONITORED. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT HIGH WATER TABLE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION, WHILE IT HAD NO NET EFFECT ON N2O AND CH4 FLUXES. UPTAKE OF AVAILABLE N BY THE COVER CROP SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED NITRATE IN SOIL SOLUTION, THEREBY LOWERING THE POTENTIAL FOR LEACHING AND BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT N2O EMISSIONS.

OBJECTIVES: THE MAIN OBJECTIVE WAS TO RELATE THE EFFECTS OF INFLOWING TRIBUTARIES TO WATER QUALITY AND PHYTOPLANKTON ASSEMBLAGES IN THE MOOI RIVER. METHOD: PHYSICO-CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES WERE COMPARED WITH WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVES AND KNOWN LIMITS TO ASSESS GENERAL WATER QUALITY IN THE MOOI RIVER OVER A ONE-YEAR PERIOD.

WE FOCUSED ON THE ALGORITHM IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY THE DITCH NETWORKS FROM RAW AERIAL IMAGES AND LIDAR DATA BASED ON THE MODIFICATION OF MULTIPLE FILTERS AND NUMBER OF THRESHOLD VALUES. SUCH DATA ARE NEEDED TO RELATE SPATIOTEMPORAL DRAINAGE PATTERNS TO OBSERVED CHANGES IN MANY NORTHERN RIVERS. WE DEMONSTRATE OUR APPROACH USING DATA FROM THE SIMOJOKI RIVER CATCHMENT (3,160 KM2) IN NORTHERN FINLAND. THE CATCHMENT IS DOMINATED BY FORESTS AND PEATLANDS THAT WERE ALMOST ALL DRAINED AFTER 1960. FOR TWO REPRESENTATIVE LOCATIONS IN CULTIVATED PEATLAND (DOWNSTREAM) AND PEATLAND FOREST (UPSTREAM) AREAS OF THE CATCHMENT; WE FOUND TOTAL DITCH LENGTH DENSITY (KM/KM2), ESTIMATED FROM AERIAL IMAGES AND LIDAR DATA BASED ON OUR PROPOSED ALGORITHM, TO HAVE VARIED FROM 2% TO 50% COMPARED WITH THE MONITORED DITCH LENGTH AVAILABLE FROM THE NATIONAL LAND SURVEY OF FINLAND (NLSF) IN 2018. A DIFFERENT PATTERN OF SOURCE VARIATION IN DITCH NETWORK DENSITY WAS OBSERVED FOR WHOLE-CATCHMENT ESTIMATES AND FOR THE AVAILABLE DRAINED-PEATLAND DATABASE FROM NATURAL RESOURCES INSTITUTE FINLAND (LUKE).

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF WATER MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ON SOIL OXIDATION AND N RELEASE AS AFFECTED BY DIFFERENCES IN PROXIMITY TO THE BEDROCK. OXIDATION RATES (CO2 EFFLUX), AS WELL AS CH4 AND N2O EMISSIONS, WERE MEASURED IN LYSIMETERS FILLED WITH SHALLOW AND DEEP PEAT SUBJECTED TO FOUR WATER TREATMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, NO3-N, NH4-N, SOLUBLE ORGANIC N, AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC C WERE MEASURED IN LEACHATE OBTAINED FROM THE COLLECTED SOILS. AVERAGE ANNUAL EMISSIONS FROM CONSTANTLY DRAINED SOILS WERE 298 G CO2-C M(-2) YR(-1), WITH MOST OF THE OXIDATION TAKING PLACE BETWEEN JUNE AND OCTOBER. SHORT FLOOD CYCLES INCREASED ANNUAL OXIDATION RATES COMPARED WITH CONSTANTLY DRAINED SOILS, WHICH HAD THE SECOND HIGHEST OXIDATION RATE. CONSTANTLY FLOODED SOILS HAD THE LOWEST ANNUAL OXIDATION RATES, FOLLOWED BY SUMMER FLOODED SOILS. TOTAL N LOST IN LEACHATE WAS HIGHEST FOR CONSTANTLY DRAINED SOILS, WITH NO3 BEING THE DOMINANT FORM. THE DEEP SOILS HAD HIGHER LOSSES OF SOLUBLE N AND C, WHEREAS NO3 LOSSES FROM SHALLOW SOILS WERE HIGHER. SOIL OXIDATION RATES DID NOT DIFFER DEPENDING ON PROXIMITY TO THE BEDROCK.

THAT ARE RELEVANT TO UNDERSTANDING ITS ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND BEHAVIOUR. THE MAIN TOPICS ARE PRESENTED WITHIN THE STANDARD FRAMEWORK OF THE BIOLOGICAL FLORA OF THE BRITISH ISLES: DISTRIBUTION, HABITAT, COMMUNITIES, RESPONSES TO BIOTIC FACTORS, RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENT, STRUCTURE AND PHYSIOLOGY, PHENOLOGY, FLORAL AND SEED CHARACTERS, HERBIVORES AND DISEASE, HISTORY AND CONSERVATION. 2. SERRATULA TINCTORIA IS A GYNODIOECIOUS PERENNIAL FORB OF OPEN OR SEMI-SHADED HABITATS INCLUDING GRASSLAND, HEATH, MIRE, OPEN WOODLAND AND SCRUB AND THEIR ECOTONES. IT IS FOUND THROUGHOUT MOST OF ENGLAND AND WALES BUT IT IS VERY RARE IN SCOTLAND AND ABSENT FROM IRELAND. SERRATULA TINCTORIA IS FOUND IN EUROPE AS FAR NORTH AS SOUTHERN SWEDEN AND NORWAY. IT IS ABSENT FROM MUCH OF THE BOREAL BIOGEOGRAPHICAL ZONE, INCLUDING MOST OF FENNOSCANDIA AND NORTHERN POLAND, RUSSIA AND THE BALTIC STATES, AND FROM THE LOWLAND MEDITERRANEAN ZONE. 3. SERRATULA TINCTORIA OCCURS ON SOILS OVERLYING A WIDE VARIETY OF SUPERFICIAL DEPOSITS AND SEDIMENTARY, METAMORPHIC AND IGNEOUS ROCKS, INCLUDING ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS. THE PH RANGE OF THESE SOILS IS WIDE, RANGING FROM ACIDIC TO MODERATELY ALKALINE BUT WITH NUTRIENT STATUS CLASSED AS OLIGOTROPHIC, OR MORE RARELY MESOTROPHIC. IN MIRE OR FEN HABITATS, IT OCCURS IN TOPOGENOUS OR SOLIGENOUS SITUATIONS WITH A SIMILAR SOIL WATER PH RANGE. IT IS ABLE TO TOLERATE A WIDE SPECTRUM OF SOIL WATER-TABLE CONDITIONS, RANGING FROM VERY DRY TO FLOODED. 4. SERRATULA TINCTORIA IS POLLINATED BY VARIOUS INSECTS OF THE ORDERS HYMENOPTERA, DIPTERA AND LEPIDOPTERA, PARTICULARLY BUMBLEBEES, HOVERFLIES AND BUTTERFLIES. IT PRODUCES PHYTOECDYSTEROIDS, WHICH MIMIC A HORMONE THAT REGULATES INSECT DEVELOPMENT. 5. THE SEED HAS A FEATHERY PAPPUS FOR WIND DISPERSAL AND ESTABLISHMENT IS PRIMARILY FROM SEED. HOWEVER, IT HAS STRONG DISPERSAL LIMITATION WITH SLOW MIGRATION RATES INTO RESTORED GRASSLANDS OF 1 M YEAR(-1). THE SPECIES HAS A SHORT-TERM PERSISTENT SEED BANK. SEEDLING RECRUITMENT IS ENHANCED BY DISTURBANCE THAT CREATES BARE GROUND, INCREASING LIGHT FLUX AND LOWER COVER OF BRYOPHYTES AND LITTER, AND REDUCED BY HIGHER NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY AND LACK OF MANAGEMENT. 6. FORMERLY THE SOURCE OF A YELLOW DYE, S. TINCTORIA HAS DECLINED IN BRITAIN SINCE AT LEAST THE LATE 19TH CENTURY PRIMARILY DUE TO A COMBINATION OF DRAINAGE, PLOUGHING AND AGRICULTURAL IMPROVEMENT AND, CONVERSELY, LACK OF MANAGEMENT BY CUTTING AND GRAZING IN ITS GRASSLAND, HEATH AND MIRE HABITATS. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE DECLINE SLOWED OR STABILISED BETWEEN THE LATE-1980S AND THE MID-2000S, IN PART DUE TO THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF CONSERVATION VIA STATUTORY PROTECTION ON DESIGNATED SITES AND WIDER MEASURES DELIVERED THROUGH AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES.","BIOLOGICAL FLORA OF THE BRITISH ISLES: SERRATULA TINCTORIA","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","ARTICLE","SEP",2017,"10.1111/1365-2745.12824","PLANT SCIENCES; ECOLOGY","WOS:000407838200026"

IN SWITZERLAND, ONLY 10 % TO 15 % OF AGRICULTURAL SOILS HAVE BEEN MAPPED SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE SPATIAL DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS, PRESENTING AN URGENT NEED FOR RAPID QUANTITATIVE SOIL CHARACTERIZATION. THE CURRENT SWISS SOIL SPECTRAL LIBRARY (SSL; N = 4374) IN THE MID-INFRARED RANGE INCLUDES SOIL SAMPLES FROM THE BIODIVERSITY MONITORING PROGRAM (BDM), ARRANGED IN A REGULARLY SPACED GRID ACROSS SWITZERLAND, AND TEMPORALLY RESOLVED DATA FROM THE SWISS SOIL MONITORING NETWORK (NABO). GIVEN THAT LESS THAN 2 % OF THE SAMPLES IN THE SSL ORIGINATE FROM ORGANIC SOILS, WE AIMED TO DEVELOP BOTH AN EFFICIENT CALIBRATION SAMPLING SCHEME AND ACCURATE MODELING STRATEGY TO ESTIMATE THE SOIL CARBON (SC) CONTENTS OF HETEROGENEOUS SAMPLES BETWEEN 0 AND 2 M DEPTH FROM 26 LOCATIONS WITHIN TWO DRAINED PEATLAND REGIONS (SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURAL, FOREST AND FOOD SCIENCES (HAFL) DATA SET; N = 116). THE FOCUS WAS ON MINIMIZING THE NEED FOR NEW REFERENCE ANALYSES BY EFFICIENTLY MINING THE SPECTRAL INFORMATION OF THE SSL. WE USED PARTIAL LEAST SQUARE REGRESSIONS (PLSRS), TOGETHER WITH FIVE REPETITIONS OF A LOCATION-GROUPED, 10-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION, TO PREDICT SC RANGING FROM 1 % TO 52 % IN THE LOCAL HAFL DATA SET. WE COMPARED THE VALIDATION PERFORMANCE OF DIFFERENT CALIBRATION SCHEMES INVOLVING LOCAL MODELS (1), MODELS USING THE ENTIRE SSL COMBINED WITH LOCAL SAMPLES (2), COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS SPIKING, AND SUBSETS OF LOCAL AND SSL SAMPLES OPTIMIZED FOR THE PEATLAND TARGET SITES USING THE RESAMPLING LOCAL (RS-LOCAL) ALGORITHM (3). USING LOCAL AND RS-LOCAL CALIBRATIONS WITH AT LEAST FIVE LOCAL SAMPLES, WE ACHIEVED SIMILAR VALIDATION RESULTS FOR PREDICTIONS OF SC UP TO 52 % (R-2 = 0.93 TO 0.97; BIAS = -0.07 TO 1.65; ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR (RMSE) = 2.71 % TO 3.89 % TOTAL CARBON; RATIO OF PERFORMANCE TO DEVIATION (RPD) = 3.38 TO 4.86; AND RATIO OF PERFORMANCE TO INTERQUARTILE RANGE (RPIQ) = 4.93 TO 7.09). HOWEVER, CALIBRATIONS USING RS-LOCAL ONLY REQUIRED FIVE OR 10 LOCAL SAMPLES FOR VERY ACCURATE MODELS (RMSE = 3.16 % AND 2.71 % TOTAL CARBON, RESPECTIVELY), WHILE PURELY LOCAL CALIBRATIONS REQUIRED 50 SAMPLES FOR SIMILARLY ACCURATE RESULTS (RMSE < 3 % TOTAL CARBON). OF THE THREE APPROACHES, THE ENTIRE SSL SPIKED WITH LOCAL SAMPLES FOR MODEL CALIBRATION LED TO VALIDATIONS WITH THE LOWEST PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF R-2, BIAS, RMSE, RPD AND RPIQ.

ON THE OTHER HAND, POVERTY OFTEN CORRELATES DIRECTLY WITH THE TYPE OF ENERGY SUPPLY AND FOOD SECURITY. ENERGY IS PROVIDED MAINLY BY BIOMASS THROUGH FIREWOOD, CHARCOAL, PEAT, AND AGRICULTURAL RESIDUES, WHICH IMPLIES FURTHER DEFORESTATION. THESE FACTORS INCREASE THE PRESSURE ON EXISTING FOREST AREAS BOTH FOR THE RECLAMATION OF NEW AGRICULTURAL LAND AND FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FIREWOOD AND CHARCOAL. FINALLY, BURUNDI IS CLASSIFIED BY THE UN AS A COUNTRY WITH ECONOMIC WATER SCARCITY DUE TO THE POPULATION GROWTH RATE, LOW LEVEL OF EDUCATION, AND A HIGH POVERTY RATE. THE ECONOMIC WATER SCARCITY IS CLOSELY LINKED TO ENERGY PRODUCTION AND TO AGRICULTURE. MORE HYDROPOWER COULD REDUCE THE EXTENT OF DEFORESTATION. THE HIGH DEFORESTATION RATE REDUCES THE INFILTRATION RATE (LESS GROUNDWATER RECHARGE) AND INCREASES SURFACE RUN-OFF. THE LATTER IS LEADING TO HIGHER EROSION AND LOSS OF SOIL FERTILITY, THUS INFLUENCING AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY NEGATIVELY. (C) 2020 S.

AS SUCH, THEY COMPRISE AN UPCOMING CLASS OF FUNCTIONAL FOODS. HOWEVER, APART FROM BIOACTIVE SECONDARY METABOLITES, MICROGREENS ALSO ACCUMULATE ANTINUTRITIVE AGENTS SUCH AS NITRATE, ESPECIALLY UNDER CONDUCIVE PROTECTED CULTIVATION CONDITIONS. THE CURRENT WORK EXAMINED NUTRIENT DEPRIVATION BEFORE HARVEST (DBH), APPLIED BY REPLACING NUTRIENT SOLUTION WITH OSMOTIC WATER FOR SIX AND TWELVE DAYS, AS A STRATEGY FOR REDUCING MICROGREEN NITRATE LEVELS IN DIFFERENT SPECIES (LETTUCE, MUSTARD, AND ROCKET). THE THREE SPECIES WERE SOWN ON A PEAT-BASED SUBSTRATE, CULTIVATED IN A CONTROLLED CLIMATE CHAMBER, AND HARVESTED 18 DAYS AFTER SOWING, WHEN THE FIRST TWO TRUE LEAVES EMERGED. DBH IMPACT ON MAJOR CONSTITUENTS OF THE SECONDARY METABOLOME, MINERAL CONTENT, COLORIMETRIC, AND YIELD TRAITS WAS APPRAISED. NITRATE AND MINERAL CONTENT WERE DETERMINED THROUGH ION CHROMATOGRAPHY, PHENOLIC COMPOSITION THROUGH UHPLC-Q-ORBITRAP HRMS, AND CAROTENOID COMPOSITION THROUGH HPLC-DAD. NUTRIENT DEPRIVATION WAS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING NITRATE CONTENT; HOWEVER, EFFECTIVE TREATMENT DURATION DIFFERED BETWEEN SPECIES AND DECLINE WAS MORE PRECIPITOUS IN NITRATE HYPERACCUMULATING SPECIES SUCH AS ROCKET. QUERCETIN AND KAEMPFEROL GLYCOSIDES WERE THE FLAVONOL GLYCOSIDES MOST ABUNDANT IN BRASSICACEOUS MICROGREENS, WHEREAS LETTUCE MICROGREENS WERE STEEPED IN CAFFEOYL QUINIC ACID. DBH INTERACTED WITH SPECIES AS IT INCREASED THE TOTAL PHENOLIC CONTENT OF LETTUCE, DECREASED THAT OF ROCKET, BUT DID NOT AFFECT MUSTARD. FURTHER RESEARCH TO LINK CHANGES IN PHENOLIC COMPOSITION TO THE SENSORY AND IN VIVO BIOACTIVE PROFILE OF MICROGREENS IS WARRANTED. NOTABLY, BRIEF (<= 6 DAYS) DBH CAN BE APPLIED ACROSS SPECIES WITH MODERATE OR NO IMPACT ON THE PHENOLIC, CAROTENOID, AND MINERAL COMPOSITION OF MICROGREENS. BRIEF DBH APPLICATIONS ALSO HAVE LIMITED IMPACT ON MICROGREENS' YIELD AND COLORIMETRIC TRAITS HENCE ON THE COMMERCIAL VALUE OF THE PRODUCT. THEY CAN THEREFORE BE APPLIED FOR REDUCING MICROGREEN NITRATE LEVELS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTING KEY SECONDARY METABOLIC CONSTITUENTS AND THEIR POTENTIAL BIOACTIVE ROLE.","PREHARVEST NUTRIENT DEPRIVATION RECONFIGURES NITRATE, MINERAL, AND PHYTOCHEMICAL CONTENT OF MICROGREENS","FOODS","ARTICLE","JUN",2021,"10.3390/foods10061333","FOOD SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY","WOS:000666428400001"

THE DRAINAGE MODULE IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF THE HYDROGEOLOGICAL EFFECT OF DRAINAGE AND SOIL DRAINAGE. FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE DRAINAGE CALCULATION MODULE, AN EMPIRICAL, ANALYTICAL, WATER-BALANCE METHOD IS USED, OR IT IS ACCEPTED ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS WITHOUT SUFFICIENT ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTALJUSTIFICATION. THIS DOES NOT MEET THE MODERN REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CREATION AND OPERATION OF SUCH OBJECTS. TRADITIONALLY, THE DESIGNS AND PARAMETERS OF AGRICULTURAL DRAINAGE ARE DETERMINED BY THE DRAINAGE MODULE. IT PROVIDES THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR THE REMOVAL OF EXCESS MOISTURE OF THE ACTIVE SOIL LAYER IN THE SPRING (AS THE MAIN CALCULATION) AND CORRESPONDS TO A CERTAIN LEVEL OF THE CALCULATED SECURITY OF THE FORMATION OF THE RUNOFF HYDROGRAPH. ACCORDING TO THE GENERALIZED RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH, IN THE CALCULATION OF DRAINAGE PARAMETERS, THE VALUES OF DRAINAGE MODULES WERE TAKEN WITHIN: FOR MINERAL SOILS - 0.4... 0.6 I/S.HA, FOR PEAT SOILS 0.2... 0.6 I/S.HA. THESE RECOMMENDED VALUES ARE NOT CORRECT BECAUSE THEN THE DEFINED DRAINAGE PARAMETERS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ONLY THE TECHNOLOGICAL CONDITIONS OF ITS OPERATION. BUT THIS DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE CONDITIONS OF FORMATION OF ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECT WITHIN THE SYSTEM, AND THEY ARE NOT ECONOMICALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY OPTIMAL FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE DRAINAGE SYSTEM AND ITS ELEMENTS. WE HAVE PERFORMED RESEARCH AND EVALUATION OF THE HYDROGEOLOGICAL EFFECT OF THE DRAINAGE AND DRAINAGE SYSTEMS. THE RESULTS OF THESE RESEARCHES SHOWED THE VARIABILITY OF VALUES OF DRAINAGE MODULES IN TIME AND SPACE. WE HAVE ALSO IDENTIFIED MANY INFLUENCING FACTORS AND CONFIRMED THEIR DIFFERENCE WITH THE CALCULATED VALUE. A NEW EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DRAINAGE SYSTEMS AND THE CALCULATION OF DRAINAGE MODULES ARE PROPOSED. THIS EVALUATION INCLUDES THE YIELD CRITERION FOR VARIABLE NATURAL (CLIMATIC) AND AGRICULTURAL CONDITIONS. NEW OPTIMAL VALUES OF DRAINAGE MODULES ARE PROPOSED.

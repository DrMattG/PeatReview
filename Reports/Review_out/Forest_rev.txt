MASS OF HG IN FOREST VEGETATION (ROUGHLY 0.1 MG M(-2)) IS ABOUT AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE SMALLER THAN THAT IN THE FOREST FLOOR (1 MG M(-2)) AND TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE SMALLER THAN THAT IN THE MINERAL SOIL (10 MG M(-2)). MASS OF HG IN PEAT (20 MG M(-2)) IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THAT IN MINERAL SOIL AND THE FOREST FLOOR; WETLANDS USUALLY SEQUESTER MORE HG THAN ASSOCIATED UPLANDS. THE STRONG RELATIONSHIP OF HG TO ORGANIC MATTER, ASSOCIATED WITH BINDING BY REDUCED S GROUPS, IS FUNDAMENTAL TO UNDERSTANDING HG DISTRIBUTION AND BEHAVIOR IN TERRESTRIAL SYSTEMS. THE STOICHIOMETRY OF THE HG-C RELATIONSHIP VARIES; HG-S RELATIONSHIPS, THOUGH LESS VARIABLE, ARE NOT CONSTANT. BECAUSE OF THE HG-ORGANIC MATTER LINK, LANDSCAPE CONDITIONS THAT LEAD TO DIFFERENTIAL SOIL ORGANIC MATTER ACCUMULATION ARE LIKELY TO LEAD TO DIFFERENTIAL HG ACCUMULATION. THE RATIO OF METHYLMERCURY (MEHG) TO TOTAL HG IS GENERALLY LOW IN BOTH VEGETATION (NEAR 1.5%) AND SOIL (< 1%), BUT AREAS OF POORLY DRAINED SOILS AND WETLANDS ARE SITES OF MEHG PRODUCTION. THE ANNUAL EMISSION OF ANTHROPIC HG FROM THE 48;CONTIGUOUS STATES OF THE USA (144 MG) IS TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE LESS THAN THE POOL OF HG IN FORESTS OF THOSE STATES (30 300 MG). PEATTANDS, LESS THAN 2% OF TOTAL LAND AREA, SEQUESTER MORE THAN 20 TIMES ANNUAL EMISSIONS (2930 MG). IF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECTS C STORAGE IT WILL INDIRECTLY AFFECT HG STORAGE, HAVING A MAJOR EFFECT ON THE BALANCE BETWEEN EMISSIONS AND SEQUESTRATION AND ON THE GLOBAL HG CYCLE.","MERCURY SEQUESTRATION IN FORESTS AND PEATLANDS: A REVIEW","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY","REVIEW","MAR-APR",2003,NA,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000181618300002"

UNDISTURBED PEATLANDS ARE CURRENTLY A WEAK CARBON SINK (SIMILAR TO 0.1 PG C Y(-1)), A MODERATE SOURCE OF METHANE (CH4; SIMILAR TO 0.03 PG CH4 Y(-1)), AND A VERY WEAK SOURCE OF NITROUS OXIDE (N2O; SIMILAR TO 0.00002 PG N2O-N Y(-1)). ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE, PRIMARILY AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY DRAINAGE (10%-20% OF GLOBAL PEATLANDS), RESULTS IN NET CO2 EMISSIONS, REDUCED CH4 EMISSIONS, AND INCREASED N2O EMISSIONS. THIS LIKELY CHANGES THE GLOBAL PEATLAND GREENHOUSE GAS BALANCE TO A C SOURCE (SIMILAR TO 0.1 PG C Y(-1)), A 10% SMALLER CH4 SOURCE, AND A LARGER (BUT STILL SMALL) N2O SOURCE (SIMILAR TO 0.0004 PG N2O-N Y(-1)). THERE IS NO STRONG EVIDENCE THAT PEATLANDS SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTED TO 20TH CENTURY CHANGES IN THE ATMOSPHERIC BURDEN OF CO2, CH4, OR N2O; WILL THIS PICTURE CHANGE IN THE 21ST CENTURY? A REVIEW OF EXPERIMENTAL AND OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES OF PEATLAND DYNAMICS INDICATES THAT THE MAIN GLOBAL CHANGE IMPACTS ON PEATLANDS THAT MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE IMPACTS ARE (1) DRAINAGE, ESPECIALLY IN THE TROPICS; (2) WIDESPREAD PERMAFROST THAW; AND (3) INCREASED FIRE INTENSITY AND FREQUENCY AS A RESULT OF DRIER CLIMATIC CONDITIONS AND (OR) DRAINAGE. QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATES OF GLOBAL CHANGE IMPACTS ARE LIMITED BY THE SPARSE FIELD DATA (PARTICULARLY IN THE TROPICS), THE LARGE VARIABILITY PRESENT IN EXISTING DATA, UNCERTAINTIES IN THE FUTURE TRAJECTORY OF PEATLAND USE, INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF INDIVIDUAL IMPACTS, AND THE UNPRECEDENTED RATES OF CLIMATE CHANGE EXPECTED IN THE 21ST CENTURY.","PEATLANDS IN THE EARTH'S 21ST CENTURY CLIMATE SYSTEM","ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS","REVIEW",NA,2011,"10.1139/A11-014","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000297028000018"
"3","MOORE PD, 2002, ENVIRON CONSERV","MOORE PD","THE TEMPERATE PEATLANDS ARE EXTENSIVE, COVERING AROUND 3.5 MILLION KM(2) OF LAND. THEY CONTAIN ABOUT 455 GT OF CARBON, ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO THE CARBON STORED IN ALL OF THE LIVING THINGS ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET, AND REPRESENTING AROUND 25% OF ALL THE SOIL CARBON ON EARTH. THESE BOGS ARE A SINK FOR ATMOSPHERIC CARBON AND THEIR CARBON UPTAKE ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 12% OF CURRENT HUMAN EMISSIONS. THEY VARY CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR FORM AND STRUCTURE AND ARE AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, INCLUDING THE STUDY OF PAST ENVIRONMENTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THEY ARE ALSO VALUABLE IN ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION. THEY ARE LOW IN BIODIVERSITY, BUT THEIR FAUNA AND FLORA ARE DISTINCTIVE AND MANY GROUPS ARE CONFINED TO THIS HABITAT. FOR ALL THESE REASONS, THE FUTURE CONSERVATION OF PEATLANDS IS A MATTER FOR CONCERN. THREATS TO PEATLANDS COME FROM DIRECT HUMAN EXPLOITATION IN THE FORM OF PEAT HARVESTING FOR ENERGY AND HORTICULTURE, AND DRAINAGE FOR FORESTRY. RISING ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS SHOULD CONTROL BOTH OF THESE PROCESSES IN THE WESTERN WORLD, BUT CONTINUED NORTHERN PEATLAND LOSSES ARE LIKELY LOCALLY, ESPECIALLY IN ASIA. PEATLAND DRAINAGE FOR FORESTRY OR AGRICULTURE WILL RESULT IN LOSSES OF CARBON TO THE ATMOSPHERE, ADDING TO THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT. HUMAN POPULATION PRESSURES, INDUSTRIALIZATION AND URBANIZATION ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE INFLUENCE IN THE BOREAL ZONE. FRAGMENTATION OF THE HABITAT IS NOT AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION BECAUSE BOGS ARE BY THEIR VERY NATURE 'ISLAND' HABITATS. ACIDIFICATION BY AERIAL POLLUTION MAY BE A LOCAL PROBLEM CLOSE TO SOURCES, BUT THE HABITAT IS NATURALLY ACID AND SHOULD NOT BE SEVERELY AFFECTED, THE INPUT OF AERIAL NUTRIENTS, HOWEVER, PARTICULARLY NITROGEN, COULD HAVE WIDESPREAD IMPACT ON BOGS, ENHANCING THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND ALTERING THEIR VEGETATION COMPOSITION. THE PHYSICAL REHABILITATION OF BOGS DAMAGED BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES PRESENTS MANY PROBLEMS, PARTICULARLY RELATING TO THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF PEAT STRUCTURE AND VEGETATION, BUT THE PROCESS CAN RESULT IN THE RE-FORMATION OF A CARBON SINK SO IT IS WORTH THE EFFORT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN ITS IMPACT ON BOGS. HIGHER TEMPERATURE (ESPECIALLY IF ACCOMPANIED BY RAISED ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS AND INCREASED NITRATE DEPOSITION) WILL ENHANCE PRODUCTIVITY, BUT WILL ALSO RESULT IN FASTER DECOMPOSITION RATES. THE OUTCOME OF THESE OPPOSING FACTORS FOR PEAT FORMATION WILL ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON THE FUTURE PATTERN OF PRECIPITATION. IF, AS SEEMS MOST LIKELY, SUMMER CONDITIONS BECOME WARMER AND DRIER IN CONTINENTAL REGIONS AND WINTERS BECOME MILDER AND WETTER, THE SUMMER DROUGHT COULD CAUSE PEAT LOSS AND BOG CONTRACTION. AN EXCESS OF DECOMPOSITION WILL LEAD TO BOGS BECOMING A CARBON SOURCE AND THUS A POSITIVE FEEDBACK IN GLOBAL WARMING. EMISSIONS OF METHANE AND NITROUS OXIDE WOULD ADD TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS PROBLEM, BUT LIKELY OXIDATION OF METHANE AND LOW N(2)O PRODUCTION MAY WELL MEAN THAT THIS IMPACT WILL NOT PROVE TO BE SIGNIFICANT. TREE INVASION OF BOGS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUMMER DROUGHT COULD LOCALLY LEAD TO INCREASED WATER LOSS THROUGH TRANSPIRATION, AND HIGHER HEAT ABSORPTION THROUGH ALBEDO CHANGE. THIS WILL ENHANCE THE DRYING EFFECT ON THE BOG SURFACE. OCEANIC MIRES WILL BE LESS SEVERELY AFFECTED IF THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN PRECIPITATION TAKES PLACE IN THESE REGIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT OVERALL FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE FUTURE OF THE NORTHERN BOGS IS LIKELY TO BE THE QUANTITY AND PATTERN (BOTH SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY) OF FUTURE PRECIPITATION IN THE ZONE.","THE FUTURE OF COOL TEMPERATE BOGS","ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION","REVIEW","MAR",2002,"10.1017/S0376892902000024","BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000175924000002"

SINCE WOOD ASH CONTAINS NUTRIENTS THAT TREES NEED IN THE RIGHT PROPORTIONS, EXCEPT FOR N, IT IS A POTENTIALLY EXCELLENT FOREST FERTILISER. HOWEVER, ANY HARMFUL ELEMENTS, E.G., HEAVY METALS ARE ALSO CONCENTRATED IN THE ASH, WHICH HAS RAISED CONCERN ABOUT POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS THAT ASH FERTILISATION COULD INDUCE IN THE ENVIRONMENT. A CONSIDERABLE BODY OF NEW RESULTS HAS BEEN PUBLISHED ON ASH FERTILISATION IMPACTS ON, E.G., HEAVY METAL CONCENTRATIONS IN BERRIES AND MUSHROOMS, GROUND VEGETATION, SOIL MICROBIAL PROCESSES, GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND WATERCOURSES. IN THIS REVIEW, WE SYNTHESISE THIS INFORMATION TO MAP THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND RISKS RELATED TO ASH FERTILISATION. WE PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO PEATLAND FORESTS, N-RICH ECOSYSTEMS WHERE ASH MAY INDUCE CONSIDERABLE INCREASES IN TIMBER PRODUCTION, BUT FOR WHICH A THOROUGH EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS HAS BEEN LACKING. THE LONGEST MONITORING PERIODS CURRENTLY SPAN MORE THAN FIVE DECADES. IN WELL-TARGETED SITES, ASH INCREASES TREE PRODUCTION AND/OR REDUCES SOIL ACIDITY FOR DECADES. NO ENRICHMENT OF HEAVY METALS IN THE FOOD WEBS OR LEACHING OF HEAVY METALS TO WATERCOURSES HAS BEEN REPORTED. CO2 EMISSIONS INCREASE IN THE LONGER TERM (10-50 YEARS), ESPECIALLY FROM N-RICH PEAT SOILS. ALSO, CHANGES IN PLANT COMMUNITY MAY BE SO EXTENSIVE THAT ASH APPLICATION CANNOT BE RECOMMENDED WHERE CONSERVATION OF THE ORIGINAL VEGETATION IS REQUIRED. IMMOBILISATION OF HEAVY METALS IN SOIL DEPENDS ON THE NEUTRALISING EFFECT OF ASH ON SOIL ACIDITY. THE MOST CRUCIAL QUESTION THAT REMAINS TO BE ANSWERED IS HOW LONG THIS EFFECT LASTS, AND WHAT HAPPENS THEREAFTER. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD INVESTIGATE FURTHER WHETHER HEAVY METALS MAY ACCUMULATE IN PLANT ROOTS, EVEN IF ABOVE-GROUND PARTS REMAIN UNAFFECTED. FINALLY, THE DURATION OF THE IMPACT OF ASH FERTILISATION ON THE NUTRITION OF PEATLAND TREES, AS WELL AS OPTIMAL SCHEDULES OF REPEATED FERTILISATIONS FOR DIFFERENT ROTATIONS, STILL NEED TO BE VERIFIED.

PLANT FOSSIL REMAINS REPRESENT THE PRE-ERUPTION VEGETATION OF THE SWAMP, WHICH RESULTED FROM ACCUMULATION OF PEAT IN A HIGH-ASH, PLANAR (RHEOTROPHIC) MIRE SITUATED IN A NARROW PALAEOVALLEY CONTAINING AN ACTIVE FLUVIAL SYSTEM. A TUFF BED (THE BELKA) AT THE BASE OF THE VOLCANICLASTIC WHETSTONE HORIZON WAS EXPOSED IN TWO CONTIGUOUS EXCAVATIONS OVER AN AREA OF 50 M(2) IN THE RADNICE BASIN OF WESTERN BOHEMIA, CZECH REPUBLIC. TWENTY-SEVEN MORPHOTAXA WERE IDENTIFIED, REPRESENTING 20 WHOLE-PLANT SPECIES WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF GROWTH FORMS. THE CANOPY OF THE PEAT-FORMING COMMUNITY WAS DOMINATED BY CORDAITES BORASSIFOLIUS TREES TOGETHER WITH THE ARBORESCENT LYCOPSID ""LEPIDODENDRON"" (= PARALYCOPODITES), WHEREAS LEPIDOPHLOIOS CF. ACEROSUS WAS SUBDOMINANT. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE LATERALLY EXTENSIVE ""CROWNS"" OF THESE ARBORESCENT LYCOPSIDS; WOULD HAVE OVERLAPPED DURING THE FINAL PHASE OF THEIR LIFE CYCLES, BUT DIFFERENCES IN THE HEIGHT OF TREE SPECIES RESULTED IN A COMPLEX AND VERTICALLY VARIABLE CANOPY INTERRUPTED BY RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED GAPS. THE UNDERSTOREY WAS DOMINATED BY MEDULLOSAN PTERIDOSPERMS AND MARATTIALEAN TREE FERNS, WHEREAS ZYGOPTERID FERNS AND SPHENOPHYLLS; COMPRISED THE BULK OF THE GROUND COVER. IN COMPARISON WITH THE CANOPY, UNDERSTOREY AND GROUND COVER SPECIES WERE LESS ABUNDANT AND PATCHIER IN DISTRIBUTION, WITH ALMOST COMPLETE ABSENCE BENEATH THE DEEP SHADE OF C. BORASSIFOLIUS TREES. LIANAS THAT ENTWINED ARBORESCENT TREES WERE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE PEAT-FORMING FOREST. THREE LYGINOPTERID PTERIDOSPERM SPECIES ALONG WITH A SPHENOPHYLL HAD A LIANESCENT HABIT BASED ON THEIR CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH UPRIGHT OR PRONE LYCOPSID TRUNKS AND ""CANOPY"" BRANCHES. SPECIES RICHNESS IN THE SWAMP SUPERFICIALLY APPEARS LOW. HOWEVER, CONSIDERING THE SMALL AREA OF EXCAVATION, ALONG WITH THE HIGHER DIVERSITY KNOWN FROM THE SAME TUFF BED IN THE ADJACENT, FORMER OPENCAST OVCIN MINE, IT APPEARS THAT SPECIES RICHNESS IN THE FOREST WAS COMPARABLE TO SOME OF THE LESS DIVERSE WESTPHALIAN PEAT-FORMING SWAMPS IN THE U.S.A. THE LOWER RADNICE MIRE VEGETATION WAS COMPOSITIONALLY HOMOGENEOUS, BUT HAD A HETEROGENEOUS DISTRIBUTION WITH PATCHINESS OCCURRING AT A VERY FINE SCALE.

PICEA MARIANA ROOTS WERE COLLECTED AT FOUR STRONGLY DIFFERING BOREAL FOREST SITES: AN UNDISTURBED FOREST SITE WITH DEEP LITTER AND HUMUS LAYERS; A RECENTLY REGENERATED FOREST; A CLEARCUT, FORMER PORTABLE SAWMILL SITE WITH A FEW SMALL, NATURALLY REGENERATED TREES; AND AN OPEN PEAT BOG PENETRATED BY ROOTS FROM TREES GROWING ALONG THE MARGIN. COMPARISONS WERE DONE ON ISOLATE ASSEMBLAGES PRIMARILY FROM SERIALLY WASHED MYCORRHIZAE, SUPPLEMENTED WITH COMPARISON SAMPLES FROM WASHED ROOT BARK AND ADHERENT RHIZOSPHERE SOIL. THE BRAY & CURTIS SIMILARITY INDEX AND NODAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS WERE UTILISED TO IDENTIFY TRENDS WITHIN THE DATA. ROOT ENDOPHYTE FUNGI, MAINLY PHIALOCEPHALA FORTINII AND MELINIOMYCES VARIABILIS, WERE AMONG THE MOST COMMON ISOLATES FROM SERIALLY WASHED MYCORRHIZAE AND SHOWED STRONG TRENDS AMONG THE SITE TYPES, WITH THE FORMER MOST COMMON FROM SITES LOW IN HUMUS AND ALSO LOW IN KNOWN HUMUS-ASSOCIATED MICROFUNGI, AND THE LATTER MOST COMMON FROM THE PEAT BOG SITE. THE OVERALL COMPOSITION OF THE ISOLATE ASSEMBLAGES FROM WASHED MYCORRHIZAE MAINLY REFLECTED SITE FACTORS, WITH ASSEMBLAGES FROM THE UNDISTURBED AND REGENERATED FOREST SITES SIMILAR TO ONE ANOTHER AND THOSE FROM THE CLEARCUT AND PEAT BOG SITES STRONGLY DISTINCT. A MAJOR DIFFERENCE WAS ALSO SEEN BETWEEN TWO SEASONAL SAMPLES AT THE EXPOSED CLEARCUT SITE, BUT FEW SEASONAL DIFFERENCES WERE SEEN AT THE OTHER SITES. THE REGENERATED AND UNDISTURBED FOREST SITES WERE HIGH IN UMBELOPSIS ISABELLINA, MORTIERELLA VERTICILLATA AND PENICILLIUM SPINULOSUM, FUNGI TYPICAL OF HUMIC HORIZONS IN BOREAL PODZOLS; THE CLEARCUT YIELDED THE GREATEST NUMBERS OF FUSARIUM PROLIFERATUM, UMBELOPSIS NANA AND PENICILLIUM MONTANENSE ISOLATES, AN ASSEMBLAGE TENDING TO INDICATE EXPOSED MINERAL SOIL; WHILE THE PEAT BOG WAS TYPIFIED BY THE PRESENCE OF CHARACTERISTIC NORTHERN PEAT INHABITANTS MORTIERELLA PULCHELLA AND P SPINULOSUM, AS WELL AS TEMPERATE PEAT INHABITANT PENICILLIUM LIVIDUM. A SYNTHESIS OF THESE RESULTS WITH OTHER DATA SUGGESTS THAT AS A MICROHABITAT, THE MYCORRHIZOSPHERE, AS ORIGINALLY DEFINED BY FOSTER & MARKS, IS OF LITTLE SIGNIFICANCE IN DETERMINING THE STRUCTURE OF FILAMENTOUS FUNGAL POPULATIONS IN SOIL INFLUENCED BY THE PRESENCE OF ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FOREST TREE ROOTS.

KA. THE CHRONOLOGY WAS DEVELOPED USING TEPHROCHRONOLOGY, PALAEOMAGNETISM AND RADIOCARBON DATING TOGETHER WITH CLIMATO- AND PALYNO-STRATIGRAPHY. TWO OF 14 TEPHRA LAYERS IN THE CORES PROVIDE MARKERS FOR CORRELATING THE RECORD WITH OTHER NEW ZEALAND CLIMATO-STRATIGRAPHIC SEQUENCES, DEEP-SEA CORES AND THE GLOBAL MARINE ISOTOPE RECORD. POLLEN, DIATOM, PALAEOMAGNETIC, SEDIMENTOLOGIC AND PIGMENT ANALYSES SHOW THAT LAKE OMAPERE, CURRENTLY SIMILAR TO 2 M DEEP, HAS HAD A DISCONTINUOUS HISTORY. OCCUPYING A SHALLOW BASIN PERCHED PARTLY WITHIN OLD BASALT LAVAS, THE INITIAL (ALKALINE) LAKE FORMED TOWARDS THE END OF MIS 5A AT CA. 80 CAL.

THE LAKE FILLED RAPIDLY TO A LEVEL SIMILAR TO 1-2 M ABOVE THAT AT PRESENT. SUCH FILLING WAS PROBABLY UNRELATED TO CLIMATE BUT A SUBSEQUENT PHASE OF VARIABLE BUT GENERALLY FAILING LAKE LEVELS AND INCREASING DYSTROPHY MAY HAVE BEEN CLIMATICALLY CONTROLLED, COMMENCING DURING MIS 4 AND CULMINATING IN PERIODS EARLY IN MIS 3 WHEN THE LAKE BECAME SWAMPY OR DRY. CONDITIONS OF NON-DEPOSITION (OR NON-PRESERVATION) OBTAINED FOR MOST OF THE PERIOD AFTER CA. 55 CAL. KA (ROTOEHU ASH) UNTIL FORMATION OF THE MODEM LAKE APPROXIMATELY 600-700 CAL. YEARS AGO OR SOON AFTER, AS INDICATED BY THE PRESENCE OF TEPHRA-1, IDENTIFIED IN PART AS KAHAROA TEPHRA (AD 1314), NEAR THE TOP OF THE CORE. THE MODEM LAKE ORIGINATED POSSIBLY THROUGH DAMMING OF THE WESTERN OUTLET AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ACCELERATED EROSION ACCOMPANYING EARLIEST POLYNESIAN DEFORESTATION, AN INTERPRETATION SUPPORTED BY MAORI ORAL TRADITION. THE POLLEN RECORD INDICATES THAT BEECH NOTHOFAGUS (PRESUMABLY N. TRUNCATA) WAS MUCH MORE COMMON IN NORTHLAND DURING THE LAST GLACIAL, AND THAT FOR THIS REGION THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF NOTHOFAGUS VS. AGATHIS POLLEN SERVES AS A BETTER INDICATOR OF COOLER VERSUS WARMER INTERVALS DURING THE QUATERNARY THAN THE RATIO OF TREE TO NON-TREE POLLEN. HOWEVER, IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT MOISTURE BALANCE WAS A MORE CRITICAL FACTOR THAN TEMPERATURE IN VEGETATION COMPOSITION AND DISTRIBUTION, PARTICULARLY DURING THE LGM, AND THE LONG PERIODS OF HIATUS MAY ALSO BE LINKED TO A DRIER CLIMATE THAN PRESENT. CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS BETWEEN THE POLLEN CURVES CONFIRM THAT SEVERAL TREE SPECIES (HALOCARPUS BIDWILLII, H. BIFORMIS AND PHYLLOCLADUS ALPINUS), PREVIOUSLY PALYNOLOGICALLY CONCEALED WITHIN GENERIC TAXONOMIC GROUPS, OCCURRED ABOUT TWO DEGREES LATITUDE FURTHER NORTH AND AT A MUCH LOWER ALTITUDE THAN THEIR CURRENT LIMITS DURING COOLER OR DRIER PHASES OF THE LAST GLACIAL. A TEMPERATURE DEPRESSION IN NORTHLAND OF 4 DEGREESC AT VARIOUS TIMES DURING THE LAST GLACIAL IS INFERRED FROM THESE RANGE EXPANSIONS. NEVERTHELESS, THE PERSISTENCE OF WIDESPREAD FOREST COVER SUGGESTS THAT THE LATE PLEISTOCENE CLIMATE OF NORTHLAND WAS LESS SEVERE THAN FOR MOST OF THE REST OF NEW ZEALAND AND STRENGTHENS THE ARGUMENT FOR A HEIGHTENED TEMPERATURE GRADIENT ACROSS NORTHERN NEW ZEALAND DURING THE LAST GLACIAL.

TO CONSERVE PEATLANDS AND HELP IN REALISING THE PARIS AGREEMENT, WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEIR EXTENT, STATUS, AND C STOCKS. HOWEVER, CURRENT PEATLAND KNOWLEDGE IS VAGUE ESTIMATES OF GLOBAL PEATLAND EXTENT RANGES FROM 1 TO 4.6 MILLION KM(2), AND C STOCK ESTIMATES VARY BETWEEN 113 AND 612 PG (OR BILLION TONNE C).

THIS REVIEW SHOWS THAT DIGITAL MAPPING USING FIELD OBSERVATIONS COMBINED WITH REMOTELY-SENSED IMAGES AND STATISTICAL MODELS IS AN AVENUE TO MORE ACCURATELY MAP PEATLANDS AND DECREASE THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP. WE DESCRIBE PEAT MAPPING EXPERIENCES FROM 12 COUNTRIES OR REGIONS AND REVIEW 90 RECENT STUDIES ON PEATLAND MAPPING.

MANY STUDIES HAVE DELINEATED PEAT EXTENT USING LAND COVER FROM REMOTE SENSING, ECOLOGY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL FIELD STUDIES, BUT RARELY PERFORM VALIDATION, AND CALCULATING THE UNCERTAINTY OF PREDICTION IS RARE. THIS PAPER THEN REVIEWS VARIOUS PROXIMAL AND REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES THAT CAN BE USED TO MAP PEATLANDS. THESE INCLUDE GEOPHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS (ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION, RESISTIVITY MEASUREMENT, AND GAMMA RADIOMETRICS), RADAR SENSING (SRTM, SAR), AND OPTICAL IMAGES (VISIBLE AND INFRARED).

PEATLAND DEVELOPMENT AND THE ASSOCIATED CARBON ACCUMULATION, WHICH ARE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY HYDROLOGICAL FLUCTUATIONS, ARE ALSO OF PRIME IMPORTANCE AS PEATLANDS REPRESENT LONG-TERM SINKS OF ATMOSPHERIC CARBON. IMPROVED KNOWLEDGE OF PEATLAND DEVELOPMENT AND SOIL MOISTURE VARIABILITY DURING THE HOLOCENE IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF LONG-TERM HYDROCLIMATE CHANGES, THE TERRESTRIAL CARBON CYCLE, AND TO ENABLE MORE ROBUST PREDICTIONS OF PEATLAND RESPONSE TO FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGES.

SINCE THE 1970S, ABSOLUTELY DATED TREE-RING CHRONOLOGIES COVERING SUBSTANTIAL PARTS OF THE HOLOCENE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FROM EXCAVATED REMAINS OF OAK (QUERCUS SPP.) AND PINE (PINUS SYLVESTRIS L).

MANAGING CCF FORESTS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE GROUND WATER LEVELS ARE LOWER THAN IN CLEAR-CUT EM FORESTS BUT HIGHER THAN IN MATURE EM FORESTS COULD DECREASE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND NEGATIVE WATER QUALITY IMPACTS CAUSED BOTH BY ANOXIC REDOX REACTIONS AND OXIDATION AND MINERALIZATION OF DEEP PEAT LAYERS. REGENERATION STUDIES INDICATED POTENTIAL FOR SATISFACTORY NATURAL REGENERATION UNDER CCF ON DRAINED PEATLANDS. AN ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE IN CCF OVER EM IS THAT FEWER INVESTMENTS ARE NEEDED TO ESTABLISH THE FOREST STAND AND SUSTAIN ITS GROWTH. THUS, EVEN IF THE GROWTH OF TREES IN CCF FORESTS WERE LOWER THAN IN EM FORESTS, CCF COULD AT LEAST IN SOME PEATLAND SITES TURN OUT TO BE A MORE PROFITABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT REGIME. AN ADVANTAGE OF CCF FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF SOCIALLY OPTIMAL FOREST MANAGEMENT IS THAT IT PLAUSIBLY REDUCES THE NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES OF MANAGEMENT COMPARED TO EM.

THIS PHENOMENON HAS ATTRACTED MUCH PALAEOECOLOGICAL INTEREST AND SEVERAL HYPOTHESES HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS OFTEN SYNCHRONOUS AND RAPID REDUCTION IN PINE FROM MID-HOLOCENE WOODLAND. EXPLANATIONS FOR THE 'PINE DECLINE' INCLUDE PREHISTORIC HUMAN ACTIVITY, CLIMATIC CHANGE, IN PARTICULAR A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN PRECIPITATION RESULTING IN INCREASED MIRE WETNESS, AND AIRBORNE POLLUTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPOSITION OF TEPHRA. HITHERTO, ONE LARGELY UNTESTED HYPOTHESIS IS THAT MINERAL DEFICIENCY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PINE GROWTH AND REGENERATION ON MIRE SURFACES. THE DISCOVERY OF PINE-TREE REMAINS (WOOD PIECES, STUMPS AND TRUNKS) WITHIN A PEAT LOCATED AT CADOGAN'S BOG ON THE MIZEN PENINSULA, SOUTHWEST IRELAND, PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO INVESTIGATE THE HISTORY OF PINUS SYLVESTRIS AND ALSO TO ASSESS THE IMPORTANCE OF MINERAL NUTRITION IN MAINTAINING PINE GROWTH ON MIRES.

ANALYSES OF THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT PEAT ACCUMULATION COMMENCED AT THE SITE AROUND 6000 YEARS BP WHEN PINE WAS THE DOMINANT LOCAL TREE. THEREAFTER PINUS POLLEN PERCENTAGES DIMINISH IN TWO STAGES, WITH THE SECOND DECLINE TAKING PLACE AROUND 4160 +/- 50 YEARS BP. CONCOMITANT WITH THIS DECLINE IN PINUS POLLEN, THERE IS A NOTICEABLE, SHORT-LIVED INCREASE IN WET-LOVING MIRE TAXA AND A DECREASE IN THE CONCENTRATION OF PHOSPHORUS, POTASSIUM, MAGNESIUM, CALCIUM, SODIUM, IRON AND ZINC. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT INCREASED MIRE SURFACE WETNESS, POSSIBLY THE RESULT OF A CHANGE IN CLIMATE, CREATED CONDITIONS UNSUITABLE FOR PINE GROWTH C. 4000 YEARS BP.

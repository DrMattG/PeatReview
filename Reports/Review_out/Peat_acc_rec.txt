HERE WE COMPARE THEIR POTENTIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS REGARDING NITROGEN AND LAND DEMAND. IN THE EVENT THAT NO FURTHER AREAS ARE EXPLOITED, DRAINED PEATLANDS WILL CUMULATIVELY RELEASE 80.8 GT CARBON AND 2.3 GT NITROGEN. THIS CORRESPONDS TO A CONTEMPORARY ANNUAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION OF 1.91 (0.31-3.38) GT CO2-EQ. THAT COULD BE SAVED WITH PEATLAND RESTORATION. SOIL CARBON SEQUESTRATION ON ALL AGRICULTURAL LAND HAS COMPARABLE MITIGATION POTENTIAL. HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL NITROGEN IS NEEDED TO BUILD UP A SIMILAR CARBON POOL IN ORGANIC MATTER OF MINERAL SOILS, EQUIVALENT TO 30-80% OF THE GLOBAL FERTILIZER NITROGEN APPLICATION ANNUALLY. RESTORING PEATLANDS IS 3.4 TIMES LESS NITROGEN COSTLY AND INVOLVES A MUCH SMALLER LAND AREA DEMAND THAN MINERAL SOIL CARBON SEQUESTRATION, CALLING FOR A STRONGER CONSIDERATION OF PEATLAND REHABILITATION AS A MITIGATION MEASURE.","THE UNDERAPPRECIATED POTENTIAL OF PEATLANDS IN GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION STRATEGIES","NATURE COMMUNICATIONS","ARTICLE","MAR 14",2018,"10.1038/s41467-018-03406-6","MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES","WOS:000427377100001"

THE OXYGEN-RICH ATMOSPHERE AND IRON-RICH CORE REPRESENT TWO END-MEMBERS OF THE OXYGEN-IRON (O-FE) SYSTEM, OVERLAPPING WITH THE ENTIRE PRESSURE-TEMPERATURE-COMPOSITION RANGE OF THE PLANET. THE EXTREME PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS OF THE DEEP INTERIOR ALTER THE OXIDATION STATES(1), SPIN STATES(2) AND PHASE STABILITIES(3,4) OF IRON OXIDES, CREATING NEW STOICHIOMETRIES, SUCH AS FE4O5 (REF. 5) AND FE5O6 (REF. 6). SUCH INTERACTIONS BETWEEN O AND FE DICTATE EARTH'S FORMATION, THE SEPARATION OF THE CORE AND MANTLE, AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE ATMOSPHERE. IRON, IN ITS MULTIPLE OXIDATION STATES, CONTROLS THE OXYGEN FUGACITY AND OXYGEN BUDGET, WITH HYDROGEN HAVING A KEY ROLE IN THE REACTION OF FE AND O (CAUSING IRON TO RUST IN HUMID AIR). HERE WE USE FIRST-PRINCIPLES CALCULATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS TO IDENTIFY A HIGHLY STABLE, PYRITE-STRUCTURED IRON OXIDE (FEO2) AT 76 GIGAPASCALS AND 1,800 KELVIN THAT HOLDS AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF OXYGEN. WE SHOW THAT THE MINERAL GOETHITE, FEOOH, WHICH EXISTS UBIQUITOUSLY AS 'RUST' AND IS CONCENTRATED IN BOG IRON ORE, DECOMPOSES UNDER THE DEEP LOWER-MANTLE CONDITIONS TO FORM FEO2 AND RELEASE H-2. THE REACTION COULD CAUSE ACCUMULATION OF THE HEAVY FEO2-BEARING PATCHES IN THE DEEP LOWER MANTLE, UPWARD MIGRATION OF HYDROGEN, AND SEPARATION OF THE OXYGEN AND HYDROGEN CYCLES. THIS PROCESS PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION FOR THE ORIGIN OF SEISMIC AND GEOCHEMICAL ANOMALIES IN THE DEEP LOWER MANTLE, AS WELL AS A SPORADIC O-2 SOURCE FOR THE GREAT OXIDATION EVENT OVER TWO BILLION YEARS AGO THAT CREATED THE PRESENT OXYGEN-RICH ATMOSPHERE.","FEO2 AND FEOOH UNDER DEEP LOWER-MANTLE CONDITIONS AND EARTH'S OXYGEN-HYDROGEN CYCLES","NATURE","ARTICLE","JUN 9",2016,"10.1038/nature18018","MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES","WOS:000377475100039"

THE INITIATIVE UNDERLINES THE ROLE OF SOIL ORGANIC MATTER (SOM) IN ADDRESSING THE THREE-FOLD CHALLENGE OF FOOD AND NUTRITIONAL SECURITY, ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND MITIGATION OF HUMAN-INDUCED GREENHOUSE GASES (GHGS) EMISSIONS. IT SETS AN AMBITIOUS ASPIRATIONAL TARGET OF A 4 PER 1000 (I.E. 0.4%) RATE OF ANNUAL INCREASE IN GLOBAL SOIL ORGANIC CARBON (SOC) STOCKS, WITH A FOCUS ON AGRICULTURAL LANDS WHERE FARMERS WOULD ENSURE THE CARBON STEWARDSHIP OF SOILS, LIKE THEY MANAGE DAY-TO-DAY MULTIPURPOSE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS IN A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. IN THIS PAPER, THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR THE 4 PER 1000 INITIATIVE ARE DISCUSSED. WE SHOW THAT THE 4 PER 1000 TARGET, CALCULATED RELATIVE TO GLOBAL TOP SOIL SOC STOCKS, IS CONSISTENT WITH LITERATURE ESTIMATES OF THE TECHNICAL POTENTIAL FOR SOC SEQUESTRATION, THOUGH THE ACHIEVABLE POTENTIAL IS LIKELY TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER GIVEN SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONSTRAINTS. WE CALCULATE THAT LAND-BASED NEGATIVE EMISSIONS FROM ADDITIONAL SOC SEQUESTRATION COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING THE ANTHROPOGENIC CO2 EQUIVALENT EMISSION GAP IDENTIFIED FROM NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS PLEDGED BY COUNTRIES TO STABILIZE GLOBAL WARMING LEVELS BELOW 2 DEGREES C OR EVEN 1.5 DEGREES C UNDER THE PARIS AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE. THE 4 PER 1000 TARGET COULD BE IMPLEMENTED BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT DIFFERENTIATED SOC STOCK BASELINES, REVERSING THE CURRENT TREND OF HUGE SOIL CO2 LOSSES, E.G. FROM AGRICULTURE ENCROACHING PEATLAND SOILS. WE FURTHER DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF SOC STEWARDSHIP FOR BOTH DEGRADED AND HEALTHY SOILS ALONG CONTRASTING SPATIAL SCALES (FIELD, FARM, LANDSCAPE AND COUNTRY) AND TEMPORAL (YEAR TO CENTURY) HORIZONS. LAST, WE PRESENT SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS RELATIVE TO NON-CO2 GHGS EMISSIONS, WATER AND NUTRIENTS USE AS WELL AS CO-BENEFITS FOR CROP YIELDS AND CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION. WE UNDERLINE THE CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON-PERMANENCE OF SOC STOCKS AND SHOW HOW THE RATES OF ADOPTION AND THE DURATION OF IMPROVED SOIL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES COULD ALTER THE GLOBAL IMPACTS OF PRACTICES UNDER THE 4 PER 1000 INITIATIVE.

IT CAN BE REGARDED AS NO-REGRET SINCE INCREASING SOC IN AGRICULTURAL SOILS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO FOOD SECURITY BENEFITS THAT WILL ENHANCE RESILIENCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

OBJECTIVE THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICE HOT-SPOTS, AND FACTORS THAT CHARACTERIZE SUCH HOT-SPOTS AND DEFINE THE SPATIAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN SOUTHERN PATAGONIA (ARGENTINA). METHODS THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN SOUTHERN PATAGONIA (243.9 THOUSAND KM 2) LOCATED BETWEEN 46 DEGREES AND 55 DEGREES SL WITH THE ANDES MOUNTAINS ON THE WESTERN FRINGE AND THE ATLANTIC OCEAN ON THE EASTERN FRINGE OF THE STUDY AREA. THE STUDY REGION HAS A RANGE OF DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES (GRASSLANDS, SHRUB-LANDS, PEAT-LANDS AND FORESTS) THOUGH THE COLD ARID STEPPE IS THE MAIN VEGETATION TYPE. WE USED GEO-TAGGED DIGITAL IMAGES THAT LOCAL PEOPLE AND VISITORS POSTED IN THE PANORAMIO WEB PLATFORM TO IDENTIFY HOT-SPOTS OF FOUR CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES (AESTHETIC VALUE, EXISTENCE VALUE, RECREATION AND LOCAL IDENTITY) AND RELATE THESE HOT-SPOTS WITH SOCIAL AND BIOPHYSICAL LANDSCAPE FEATURES. RESULTS AESTHETIC VALUE WAS THE MAIN CULTURAL SERVICE TAGGED BY PEOPLE, FOLLOWED BY THE EXISTENCE VALUE FOR BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, FOLLOWED BY LOCAL IDENTITY AND THEN RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY. THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THESE CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT SOCIAL AND BIOPHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS THE PRESENCE OF WATER BODIES, VEGETATION TYPES, MARINE AND TERRESTRIAL FAUNA, PROTECTED AREAS, URBANIZATION, ACCESSIBILITY AND TOURISM OFFER. THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS ARE THE PRESENCE OF WATER IN SANTA CRUZ AND TOURISM OFFER IN TIERRA DEL FUEGO. CONCLUSIONS OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS METHODOLOGY IS USEFUL FOR ASSESSING CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AT THE REGIONAL SCALE, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WITH LOW DATA AVAILABILITY AND FIELD ACCESSIBILITY, SUCH AS SOUTHERN PATAGONIA.

USING BOTH PUBLISHED AND NEW UNPUBLISHED GEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL DATA FROM EUROPE WE CRITICALLY REVIEW THIS MODEL, SHOW HOW IT IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE EUROPEAN CONTEXT, AND EXAMINE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND RIVERINE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES (RES) INCLUDING RIVER REWILDING. THIS PAPER BRINGS TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME, ALL THE PERTINENT STRANDS OF EVIDENCE WE NOW HAVE ON THE LONG-TERM TRAJECTORIES OF FLOODPLAIN SYSTEM FROM SEDIMENT-BASED DATING TO SEDADNA. FLOODPLAIN CHRONOSTRATIGRAPHY SHOWS THAT EARLY HOLOCENE STREAMS WERE PREDOMINANTLY MULTI-CHANNEL (ANABRANCHING) SYSTEMS, OFTEN CHOKED WITH VEGETATION AND RELATIVELY RARELY SINGLE-CHANNEL ACTIVELY MEANDERING SYSTEMS. FLOODPLAINS WERE EITHER NON-EXISTENT OR LIMITED TO ADJACENT ORGANIC-FILLED PALAEOCHANNELS, SPRING/VALLEY MIRES AND FLUSHES. THIS APPLIED TO MANY, IF NOT MOST, SMALL TO MEDIUM RIVERS BUT ALSO MAJOR SECTIONS OF THE LARGER RIVERS SUCH AS THE THAMES, SEINE, RHONE, LOWER RHINE, VISTULA AND DANUBE. AS SHOWN BY RADIOCARBON AND OPTICALLY STIMULATED LUMINESCENCE (OSL) DATING DURING THE MID-LATE HOLOCENE C. 4-2 KA BP, OVERBANK SILT-CLAY DEPOSITION TRANSFORMED EUROPEAN FLOODPLAINS, COVERING FORMER WETLANDS AND SILTING-UP SECONDARY CHANNELS. THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY DIRECT INTERVENTION IN THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD INCORPORATING WEIR AND MILL BASED SYSTEMS- PART OF A DEEP ENGAGEMENT WITH RIVERS AND FLOODPLAINS WHICH IS EVEN REFLECTED IN RIVER AND FLOODPLAIN SETTLEMENT PLACE NAMES. THE FINAL TRANSFORMATION WAS THE ""INDUSTRIALISATION OF CHANNELS"" THROUGH HARD-ENGINEERING - PART OF THE ANTHROPOCENE GREAT ACCELERATION. THE PRIMARY CAUSATIVE FACTOR IN TRANSFORMING PRISTINE FLOODPLAINS WAS ACCELERATED SOIL EROSION CAUSED BY DEFORESTATION AND ARABLE FANNING, BUT WITH EFFECTIVE SEDIMENT DELIVERY ALSO REFLECTING CLIMATIC FLUCTUATIONS. LATER FLOODPLAIN MODIFICATIONS BUILT ON THESE TRANSFORMED FLOODPLAIN TOPOGRAPHIES. SO, UNLIKE NORTH AMERICA WHERE CHANNEL-FLOODPLAIN TRANSFORMATION WAS RAPID, THE TRANSFORMATION OF EUROPEAN STREAMS OCCURRED OVER A MUCH LONGER TIME-PERIOD WITH CONSIDERABLE SPATIAL DIVERSITY REGARDING TIMING AND KIND OF MODIFICATION. THIS HAS HAD IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EVOLUTION OF RES INCLUDING REDUCED CARBON SEQUESTRATION OVER THE PAST MILLENNIA. DUE TO THE MULTI-FACETED COMBINATION OF CATCHMENT CONTROLS, ECOLOGICAL CHANGE AND CULTURAL LEGACY, IT IS IMPRACTICAL, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, TO IDENTIFY AN ORIGINALLY NATURAL CONDITION AND THUS RESTORE EUROPEAN RIVERS TO THEIR PRE-TRANSFORMATION STATE (NATURALISATION). NEVERTHELESS, ATTEMPTS TO RESTORE TO HISTORICAL (PRE-INDUSTRIAL) STATES ALLOWING FOR NATURAL FLOODPLAIN PROCESSES CAN HAVE BOTH ECOLOGICAL AND CARBON OFFSET BENEFITS, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL ABIOTIC BENEFITS SUCH AS FLOOD ATTENUATION AND WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS. THIS INCLUDES REWILDING USING BEAVER REINTRODUCTION WHICH HAS OVERALL POSITIVE BENEFITS ON RIVER CORRIDOR ECOLOGY. NEW DEVELOPMENTS, PARTICULARLY BIOMOLECULAR METHODS OFFER THE POTENTIAL OF UNIFYING MODERN ECOLOGICAL MONITORING WITH THE RECONSTRUCTION OF PAST ECOSYSTEMS AND THEIR TRAJECTORIES. THE SUSTAINABLE RESTORATION OF RIVERS AND FLOODPLAINS DESIGNED TO MAXIMISE DESIRABLE RES AND NATURAL CAPITAL MUST BE PREDICATED ON THE AWARENESS THAT ANTHROPOCENE RIVERS ARE STILL LARGELY IMPRISONED IN THE BANKS OF THEIR HISTORY AND THIS REQUIRES ACCEPTANCE OF AN INCREASED COMPLEXITY FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF DESIRABLE RESTORATION GOALS.","NATURAL VS ANTHROPOGENIC STREAMS IN EUROPE: HISTORY, ECOLOGY AND IMPLICATIONS FOR RESTORATION, RIVER-REWILDING AND RIVERINE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES","EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS","ARTICLE","MAY",2018,"10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.02.001","GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000433645900010"

LONG-TERM MONITORING IS ESSENTIAL TO CAPTURE INTERANNUAL VARIATIONS IN GHG EMISSIONS AND ASSOCIATED ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES AND TO REDUCE THE UNCERTAINTY LINKED WITH GHG EMISSION FACTOR CALCULATIONS. IN THIS STUDY, WE PRESENT GHG BALANCES: CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), METHANE (CH4) AND NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) CALCULATED FOR A 5-YEAR PERIOD AT A REWETTED INDUSTRIAL CUTAWAY PEATLAND IN IRELAND (REWETTED 7YEARS PRIOR TO THE START OF THE STUDY); AND COMPARE THE RESULTS WITH AN ADJACENT DRAINED AREA (2-YEAR DATA SET), AND WITH TEN LONG-TERM DATA SETS FROM INTACT (I.E. UNDRAINED) PEATLANDS IN TEMPERATE AND BOREAL REGIONS. IN THE REWETTED SITE, CO2 EXCHANGE (OR NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE (NEE)) WAS STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION (R-ECO) RATHER THAN GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION (GPP). CH4 EMISSIONS WERE RELATED TO SOIL TEMPERATURE AND EITHER WATER TABLE LEVEL OR PLANT BIOMASS. N2O EMISSIONS WERE NOT DETECTED IN EITHER DRAINED OR REWETTED SITES. REWETTING REDUCED CO2 EMISSIONS IN UNVEGETATED AREAS BY APPROXIMATELY 50%.

VARIOUS STATISTICAL MEASURES WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE PREDICTIVE ABILITY OF THE MODEL, SHOWING THAT IT WAS SUITABLE FOR PREDICTING THE CARBON STOCKS OF SOILS. THE NEURAL NETWORK MODEL WAS USED TO MAKE PREDICTIONS FROM THE SURFACE TO 1 M IN 1 CM INTERVALS, AT 100 M SPATIAL RESOLUTION, ACROSS SCOTLAND. THIS ALLOWED US TO MAKE A PREDICTION OF THE DISTRIBUTION, SPATIALLY AND AT DEPTH, OF CARBON STOCKS TO 1 M ACROSS SCOTLAND AND TO MAKE ESTIMATES OF THE TOTAL CARBON STOCK OF SCOTTISH SOILS (2954 TG) AND THE AMOUNT STORED IN DIFFERENT SOIL TYPES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE FOUND THAT OUR ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF CARBON STORED IN SCOTTISH SOILS WAS IN AGREEMENT WITH PREVIOUS ESTIMATES. MINERAL AND ORGANO-MINERAL SOILS ARE PREDICTED TO HOLD A LARGE AMOUNT OF CARBON IN THE UPPER PORTION, AND IN TERMS OF CARBON STOCK ARE ALMOST AS IMPORTANT AS PEAT SOILS. AT INCREASED DEPTH, A MUCH SMALLER PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL SCOTTISH SOIL CARBON STOCK IS HELD IN SOILS NOT CLASSIFIED AS ORGANIC.

TO EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF PERMAFROST THAW AND RESULTANT PLANT SUCCESSION ON DOM REACTIVITY, WE USED A COMBINATION OF FOURIER TRANSFORM ION CYCLOTRON RESONANCE MASS SPECTROMETRY (FT-ICR MS), UV/VIS ABSORBANCE, AND EXCITATION-EMISSION MATRIX SPECTROSCOPY (EEMS) TO EXAMINE THE DOM ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION AND OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF 27 PORE WATER SAMPLES GATHERED FROM VARIOUS SITES ALONG A PERMAFROST THAW SEQUENCE IN STORDALEN MIRE, A THAWING SUBARCTIC PEATLAND IN NORTHERN SWEDEN. THE PRESENCE OF DENSE SPHAGNUM MOSS, A FEATURE THAT IS DOMINANT IN THE INTERMEDIATE THAW STAGES, APPEARED TO BE THE MAIN DRIVER OF VARIATION IN DOM ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION AND OPTICAL PROPERTIES AT STORDALEN. SPECIFICALLY, DOM FROM SITES WITH SPHAGNUM HAD GREATER AROMATICITY, HIGHER AVERAGE MOLECULAR WEIGHTS, AND GREATER O/C, CONSISTENT WITH A HIGHER ABUNDANCE OF PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS THAT LIKELY INHIBIT DECOMPOSITION. THESE COMPOUNDS ARE RELEASED BY SPHAGNUM AND MAY ACCUMULATE DUE TO INHIBITION OF PHENOL OXIDASE ACTIVITY BY THE ACIDIC PH AT THESE SITES. IN CONTRAST, SITES WITHOUT SPHAGNUM, SPECIFICALLY FULLY-THAWED RICH FENS, HAD MORE SATURATED, MORE REDUCED COMPOUNDS, WHICH WERE HIGH IN N AND S. OPTICAL PROPERTIES AT RICH FENS INDICATED THE PRESENCE OF MICROBIALLY-DERIVED DOM, CONSISTENT WITH THE HIGHER DECOMPOSITION RATES PREVIOUSLY MEASURED AT THESE SITES.

IN THIS WORK, WE INVESTIGATE THE UPWARD SPREAD OF PEAT FIRE FROM THE UNDERGROUND TO THE SURFACE AFTER FORCED IGNITION WHICH IS A RELEVANT CONFIGURATION BUT RARELY STUDIED. IN THE EXPERIMENT, IGNITION IS NOT POSSIBLE IF THE IGNITER IS DEEPER THAN 15 CM BELOW THE FREE SURFACE, REGARDLESS OF MOISTURE CONTENT OR DENSITY. ONCE IGNITED, THE 1ST-STAGE UPWARD FIRE SPREAD IS INITIATED TOWARDS THE FREE SURFACE (OPPOSED SMOLDERING) WITH A PEAK TEMPERATURE OF 300 DEGREES C, LEAVING BEHIND A CHAR STRUCTURE THAT DOES NOT COLLAPSE. THEN, A 2ND-STAGE DOWNWARD SPREAD (FORWARD SMOLDERING) IS ACTIVATED WITH A PEAK TEMPERATURE OF 600 DEGREES C AND REGRESSION OF FREE SURFACE. THE UPWARD SPREAD IS FASTER THAN THE DOWNWARD SPREAD. THE RATES OF BOTH UPWARD AND DOWNWARD SPREAD DECREASE AS THE PEAT DENSITY OR DEPTH IS INCREASED. THESE EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS ARE SUCCESSFULLY CAPTURED BY A ID COMPUTATIONAL MODEL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER WITH 5-STEP KINETICS.

IN THIS STUDY, WE AIM TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF MULTI-COIL OFFSET ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION (EMI) MEASUREMENTS TO PROVIDE SPATIAL ESTIMATES OF SOC CONTENT, BULK DENSITY, AND SOC STOCK FOR A HIGHLY VARIABLE AND DISTURBED PEATLAND RELICT (SIMILAR TO 35 HA) WITH A REMAINING PEAT LAYER THICKNESS OF LESS THAN 1 M.

UB WAS PREPARED THROUGH PYROLYSIS OF 2: 1 RATIO OF BIOSOLIDS TO GREENWASTE ON A DRY MASS BASIS. TWO INCUBATION EXPERIMENTS ARE REPORTED BOTH WITH FIVE DIFFERENT GROWING MEDIA MIXTURES WHICH WERE SUBJECTED TO PERIODIC WETTING AND DRYING. MEDIA MIXTURES CONSISTED OF DIFFERENT RATES OF UB (100%, 60%, 40%, 20%) MIXED WITH COMPOSTED PINE BARK ON A VOLUME BASIS AND COMPARED TO AN INDUSTRY STANDARD MEDIA WITH 0% UB. THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE MIXTURES WERE COMPARED PRE AND POST INCUBATION. SUBSTITUTING COIR PEAT WITH UB INCREASED MEDIA PH, C:N MASS RATIO, NUTRIENT CONTENT, AIR FILLED POROSITY AND BULK DENSITY. FURTHERMORE, ADDITION OF UB TO MEDIA ALSO INCREASED THE PROPORTION OF PARTICLES IN THE DESIRABLE RANGE FOR GROWING MEDIA (0.25-2 MM). UB AMENDED MIXES WERE FOUND TO BE MOST STABLE IN TERMS OF BOTH BULK DENSITY AND RESISTANCE TO PARTICLE BREAKDOWN. FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY ANALYSIS SUGGESTED THAT PERIODIC WETTING AND DRYING ENHANCED SURFACE OXIDATION.

HOWEVER, THERE IS ALSO LARGE VARIATION IN DECOMPOSITION DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS, CLIMATE AND SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT. HERE WE STUDIED THE ROLE OF SOM COMPOSITION ON PEAT DECOMPOSABILITY IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENTLY MANAGED DRAINED ORGANIC SOILS. WE COLLECTED A TOTAL OF 560 SAMPLES FROM 21 ORGANIC CROPLAND, GRASSLAND AND FOREST SOILS IN SWITZERLAND, MONITORED THEIR CO2 EMISSION RATES IN LAB INCUBATION EXPERIMENTS OVER 6 MONTHS AT TWO TEMPERATURES (10 AND 20 DEGREES C) AND RELATED THEM TO VARIOUS SOIL CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING BULK DENSITY, PH, SOIL ORGANIC CARBON (SOC) CONTENT AND ELEMENTAL RATIOS (C = N, H / C AND O / C). CO2 RELEASE RANGED FROM 6 TO 195 MG CO(2-)CG(-1) SOC AT 10 DEGREES C AND FROM 12 TO 423 MG G(-1) AT 20 DEGREES C. THIS VARIATION OCCURRING UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS SUGGESTS THAT BESIDES SOIL WATER REGIME, WEATHER AND MANAGEMENT, SOM COMPOSITION MAY BE AN UNDERESTIMATED FACTOR THAT DETERMINES CO2 FLUXES MEASURED IN FIELD EXPERIMENTS. HOWEVER, CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE INVESTIGATED CHEMICAL SOM CHARACTERISTICS AND CO2 EMISSIONS WERE WEAK. THE LATTER ALSO DID NOT SHOW A DEPENDENCE ON LAND-USE TYPE, ALTHOUGH PEAT UNDER FOREST WAS DECOMPOSED THE LEAST. HIGH CO2 EMISSIONS IN SOME TOPSOILS WERE PROBABLY RELATED TO THE ACCRUAL OF LABILE CROP RESIDUES. A COMPARISON WITH PUBLISHED CO2 RATES FROM INCUBATED MINERAL SOILS INDICATED NO DIFFERENCE IN SOM DECOMPOSABILITY BETWEEN THESE SOIL CLASSES, SUGGESTING THAT ACCUMULATION OF RECENT, LABILE PLANT MATERIALS THAT PRESUMABLY ACCOUNT FOR MOST OF THE EVOLVED CO2 IS NOT SYSTEMATICALLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN MINERAL AND ORGANIC SOILS. IN OUR DATA SET, TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY OF DECOMPOSITION (Q(10) ON AVERAGE 2.57 +/- 0.05) WAS THE SAME FOR ALL LAND USES BUT LOWEST BELOW 60 CM IN CROPLANDS AND GRASSLANDS.

THE LARGE STORE OF MERCURY (HG) IN PEATLANDS COULD BE A SOURCE OF HG FOR OVER A CENTURY EVEN IF DEPOSITION IS DRAMATICALLY REDUCED.

WE FOUND THAT IN UNFLOODED POSITIONS, LIVING SHOOTS OF SPHAGNUM AND BROWN MOSSES LOWERED [CA2+] AND PH IN THEIR CAPILLARY WATER, IN CONTRAST TO DEAD FRAGMENTS; YET WITHOUT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SPECIES. SURVIVAL AND EXPANSION OF SPHAGNUM FRAGMENTS, WHICH DID NOT DIE OF ACUTE CALCIUM TOXICITY DURING FIRST WEEKS/MONTHS, WAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY DRY WEATHER AND ALKALINE WATER CHEMISTRY, REFLECTING SPHAGNUM INTOLERANCE TO DESICCATION AND TO COMBINED HIGH [CA2+] AND PH.

THIS MECHANISM WOULD FACILITATE SPHAGNUM SURVIVAL IN ELEVATED, FREQUENTLY DESICCATED MICROHABITATS OF CALCAREOUS FENS SUCH AS BROWN-MOSS HUMMOCKS. HOWEVER, SINCE WATER-RETAINING CAPACITY OF FEW SPHAGNUM SHOOTS IS INSUFFICIENT TO CHANGE WATER CHEMISTRY IN ITS SURROUNDINGS, SURFACE ACIDIFICATION MAY OCCUR ONLY ONCE THE ENVIRONMENT (E.G.

THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT PEAT PORE NETWORKS HAVE BEEN EXTRACTED FROM X-RAY MICRO-COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (MU CT) IMAGES OF PEAT DEPOSITS AND PEAT PORE CHARACTERISTICS EVALUATED IN A 3D APPROACH.

RESULTS PORTRAY THE COMMONLY OBSERVED DECREASE IN HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY WITH DEPTH, WHICH WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE REDUCTION OF PORE RADIUS AND INCREASE IN PORE TORTUOSITY. THE INCREASE IN PORE TORTUOSITY WITH DEPTH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE DECOMPOSED PEAT SOIL AND DECREASING PORE COORDINATION NUMBER WITH DEPTH, WHICH EXTENDED THE FLOW PATH OF FLUID PARTICLES. RESULTS ALSO REVEALED THAT HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY IS ISOTROPIC LOCALLY, BUT BECOMES ANISOTROPIC AFTER UPSCALING TO CORE-SCALE; THIS SUGGESTS THE ANISOTROPY OF PEAT HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY OBSERVED IN CORE-SCALE AND FIELD-SCALE IS DUE TO THE STRONG HETEROGENEITY IN THE VERTICAL DIMENSION THAT IS IMPOSED BY THE LAYERED STRUCTURE OF PEAT SOILS.

METHODS: FIRST, WE REVISITED HISTORICAL VEGETATION PLOTS TO COLLECT PRESENT-DAY DATA AND THEN IDENTIFIED THE MOST SIMILAR PRESENT-DAY RECORD ( THE PRESENT-DAY COUNTERPART) BECAUSE NO PERMANENT PLOTS WERE AVAILABLE. SECOND, WE INFERRED WATER LEVEL, PH AND CONDUCTIVITY (A PROXY OF MINERAL RICHNESS) USING A TRAINING SET OF PRESENT-DAY FIELD MEASUREMENTS, AND CALCULATED ELLENBERG INDICATOR VALUES. THEN WE APPLIED MODIFIED TWINSPAN CLASSIFICATION, CCA, PERMANOVA, PERMDISP AND RMANOVA IN ORDER TO TEST CHANGES IN THE SPECIES COMPOSITION, BETA-DIVERSITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS BETWEEN THE HISTORICAL RECORDS AND THEIR PRESENT-DAY COUNTERPARTS. RESULTS: FEN VEGETATION HAS PERSISTED ON HALF OF THE SITES.

METHODS WE USED 3-YEAR DATA OBTAINED WITH MODIFIED INGROWTH CORE METHOD AND TESTED TWO CALCULATION METHODS: 'INGROWTH-DIVIDING' AND `INGROWTH-SUBTRACTING'. RESULTS THE INGROWTH-DIVIDING METHOD COMBINED WITH A 2-YEAR INCUBATION OF INGROWTH CORES CAN BE USED FOR THE 'BEST ESTIMATE' OF FRP. THE FRP IN THE NUTRIENT-RICH FEN FOREST (561 G M(-2)) WAS MORE THAN TWICE THAT IN THE NUTRIENT-POOR BOG FOREST (244 G M(-2)). MOST FRP OCCURRED IN THE TOP 20-CM LAYER (76-82 %).

AGRICULTURE ON REWETTED PEATLANDS (PALUDICULTURE) PROVIDES A SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVE TO DRAINAGE-BASED AGRICULTURE. ONE FORM OF PALUDICULTURE IS THE CULTIVATION OF SPHAGNUM MOSS, WHICH CAN BE USED AS A RAW MATERIAL FOR HORTICULTURAL GROWING MEDIA. UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS, MOST SPHAGNUM MOSSES ELIGIBLE FOR PALUDICULTURE TYPICALLY PREDOMINATE ONLY IN NUTRIENT-POOR WETLAND HABITATS. IT IS UNKNOWN, HOWEVER, HOW THE PREVAILING HIGH NUTRIENT LEVELS IN REWETTED AGRICULTURAL PEATLANDS INTERFERE WITH OPTIMAL SPHAGNUM PRODUCTION. WE THEREFORE STUDIED THE EFFECT OF ENRICHED NUTRIENT CONDITIONS REMAINING EVEN AFTER TOP SOIL REMOVAL AND FURTHER CAUSED BY EXTERNAL SUPPLY OF NUTRIENT-RICH IRRIGATION WATER AND (GENERALLY) HIGH INPUTS OF ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN (N) TO HABITAT BIOGEOCHEMISTRY, BIOMASS PRODUCTION AND NUTRIENT STOICHIOMETRY OF INTRODUCED SPHAGNUM PALUSTRE AND S. PAPILLOSUM IN A REWETTED PEATLAND, WHICH WAS FORMERLY IN INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL USE. AIRBORNE N WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAJOR SUPPLY OF N. PHOSPHORUS (P) AND POTASSIUM (K) WERE MAINLY SUPPLIED BY IRRIGATION WATER. THE PREVAILING HIGH NUTRIENT LEVELS (P AND K) ARE A RESULT OF NUTRIENT-RICH IRRIGATION WATER FROM THE SURROUNDINGS. PEAT POREWATER (10 CM BELOW PEATMOSS SURFACE) CO2 CONCENTRATIONS WERE HIGH, BICARBONATE CONCENTRATIONS LOW, AND THE PH WAS AROUND 4.2. PROVIDED THAT MOISTURE SUPPLY IS SUFFICIENT AND DOMINANCE OF FAST-GROWING, LARGER GRAMINOIDS SUPPRESSED (IN ORDER TO AVOID OUTSHADING OF SPHAGNUM MOSSES), STRIKINGLY VERY HIGH BIOMASS YIELDS OF 6.7 AND 6.5 T DW HA(-1) YR(-1) (S, PALUSTRE AND S.

DESPITE HIGH P AND K SUPPLY AND UPTAKE, N:P AND N:K RATIOS IN THE SPHAGNUM CAPITULA WERE STILL LOW. SPHAGNUM MOSSES ACHIEVED HIGH NUTRIENT SEQUESTRATION RATES OF 34 KG N, 17 KG K AND 4 KG P HA(-1) YR(-1) FROM MAY 2013 TO MAY 2014, WHICH SHOWS THAT THE SITE ACTED AS AN ACTIVE NUTRIENT SINK.

FALLAX) AT THE EXPENSE OF SLOWER GROWING BUT PREFERRED PEATMOSSES AS HORTICULTURAL SUBSTRATE (S. PALUSTRE AND S. PAPILLOSUM) TO OPTIMIZE THE QUALITY OF BIOMASS YIELDS. IN CONCLUSION, SPHAGNUM FARMING IS WELL ABLE TO THRIVE UNDER HIGH N INPUT PROVIDED THAT THERE IS A SIMULTANEOUS HIGH INPUT OF P AND K FROM IRRIGATION WATER, WHICH FACILITATES HIGH PRODUCTION RATES. DUE TO THE LACK OF SUITABLE, NUTRIENT POOR SITES, IT SEEMS TO BE USEFUL TO REMOVE THE TOPSOIL (MAINLY P REMOVAL) PRIOR TO START GROWING SPHAGNUM MOSSES. IN ADDITION, BICARBONATE CONCENTRATIONS HAVE TO STAY SUFFICIENTLYLOW TO ENSURE A LOW PH, CO2 SUPPLY FROM THE PEAT SOIL SHOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY HIGH TO PREVENT C LIMITATION, AND GRAMINOIDS SHOULD BE MOWN REGULARLY.

THIS STUDY AIMED AT EXPLORING THE EFFECT OF BIOCHAR ON CH4 EMISSION IN THE PADDY SOIL WITH STRAW INCORPORATION. IN THIS STUDY, THE LOW-TEMPERATURE BIOCHAR (BC300) AND HIGH-TEMPERATURE BIOCHAR (BC500 AND BC700) WERE INCUBATED WITH OR WITHOUT STRAW IN SOIL. SOIL CH4 FLUXES WERE MONITORED DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD OF LABORATORY INCUBATION. SOIL PROPERTIES WERE MEASURED, INCLUDING PH, REDOX POTENTIAL (EH) AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC). THE ABUNDANCE AND COMPOSITION OF METHANOGENIC ARCHAEAL AND METHANOTROPHIC BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES WERE ANALYZED BY REAL-TIME QUANTITATIVE PCR (QPCR) AND HIGH-THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING, RESPECTIVELY. WHEN NO STRAW WAS APPLIED, LOW-TEMPERATURE BIOCHAR DECREASED SOIL EH, INCREASED THE ABUNDANCES OF METHANOGENIC ARCHAEA, AND THUS PROMOTED THE EMISSION OF CH4, WHILE HIGH-TEMPERATURE BIOCHAR HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON CH4 EMISSION. WHEN STRAW WAS APPLIED, BIOCHAR INHIBITED CH4 EMISSION BY DECREASING THE CONTENT OF AVAILABLE CARBON FOR METHANOGENIC ARCHAEA. THE INHIBITION EFFECT OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE BIOCHAR WAS STRONGER THAN THAT OF LOW-TEMPERATURE BIOCHAR. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT CH4 EMISSION WAS AFFECTED BY BOTH BIOCHAR TYPE AND STRAW APPLICATION. BIOCHAR COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE CH4 EMISSION WHEN STRAW WAS RETURNED TO PADDY SOIL, AND THE DECREASE INDUCED BY HIGH-TEMPERATURE BIOCHAR WAS STRONGER THAN THAT OF LOW-TEMPERATURE BIOCHAR.","EFFECTS OF BIOCHAR ON CH4 EMISSION WITH STRAW APPLICATION ON PADDY SOIL","JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS","ARTICLE","FEB",2018,"10.1007/s11368-017-1761-x","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; SOIL SCIENCE","WOS:000422913000027"

THE MICRO-FTIR DATA OF MACERALS OF HUMINITE GROUP INDICATE HIGHER CONTRIBUTIONS OF ALIPHATIC HYDROGEN IN TEXTINITE, COMPARED TO MORE AROMATIC LEVIGELINITE. THE SEMI-QUANTITATIVE DIFFERENCES IN THE RATIOS OF SELECTED FUNCTIONAL GROUPS SUGGEST THAT AROMATICITY AND THE EXTENT OF OXIDATION ARE HIGHER IN LEVIGELINITE.

WE EXPECTED THAT NEAR THE EDGE OF THE THAW FEATURE, ACTIVELY THAWING PERMAFROST AND GREATER ABUNDANCE OF SEDGES WOULD INCREASE CARBON, OXYGEN AND NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY, ENABLING FASTER MICROBIAL RATES RELATIVE TO THE CENTER OF THE THAW FEATURE. WE DEVELOPED THREE DIFFERENT CONCEPTUAL REACTION NETWORKS THAT EXPLAINED THE TEMPORAL CHANGE IN POREWATER CO2, CH4, DELTA C-13-CO2 AND DELTA C-13-CH4. ALL THREE REACTION-NETWORK MODELS INCLUDED METHANE PRODUCTION, METHANE OXIDATION AND CO2 PRODUCTION, AND TWO OF THE MODELS INCLUDED HOMOACETOGENESIS-A REACTION NOT PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN ISOTOPE-BASED POREWATER MODELS. ALL THREE MODELS FIT THE DATA EQUALLY WELL, BUT RATES RESULTING FROM THE MODELS DIFFERED. MOST NOTABLY, INCLUSION OF HOMOACETOGENESIS ALTERED THE MODELED PATHWAYS OF METHANE PRODUCTION WHEN THE REACTION WAS DIRECTLY COUPLED TO METHANOGENESIS, AND IT DECREASED GROSS METHANE PRODUCTION RATES BY UP TO A FACTOR OF FIVE WHEN IT REMAINED DECOUPLED FROM METHANOGENESIS. THE ABILITY OF ALL THREE CONCEPTUAL REACTION NETWORKS TO SUCCESSFULLY MATCH THE MEASURED DATA INDICATE THAT THIS TECHNIQUE FOR ESTIMATING IN SITU REACTION RATES REQUIRES OTHER DATA AND INFORMATION FROM THE SITE TO CONFIRM THE CONSIDERED SET OF MICROBIAL REACTIONS.

IT HAS ALSO BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE RATHER ERRATIC ATMOSPHERIC DELTA C-13 AND DELTA C-14 SIGNALS SEEN DURING DEGLACIATION(1.4) COULD PARTLY BE EXPLAINED BY THE PRESENCE OF A LARGE TERRESTRIAL INERT LGM CARBON STOCK, DESPITE THE BIOSPHERE BEING LESS PRODUCTIVE (AND THEREFORE STORING LESS CARBON)(5,6).

A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN THE PERMAFROST AREA FROM THE LGM TO THE PRESENT DAY HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY A ROUGHLY 400-PETAGRAM INCREASE IN THE TOTAL SOIL CARBON STOCK. THIS INCREASE IN SOIL CARBON SUGGESTS THAT PERMAFROST CARBON HAS MADE NO NET CONTRIBUTION TO THE ATMOSPHERIC CARBON POOL SINCE THE LGM. HOWEVER, OUR RESULTS ALSO INDICATE POTENTIAL POSTGLACIAL REDUCTIONS IN THE PORTION OF THE CARBON STOCK THAT IS TRAPPED IN PERMAFROST, OF AROUND 1,000 PETAGRAMS, SUPPORTING EARLIER STUDIES(7).

HERE WE EVALUATE THE SIMULATION OF TUNDRA CARBON STOCKS AND FLUXES IN THREE LAND SURFACE SCHEMES THAT EACH FORM PART OF MAJOR EARTH SYSTEM MODELS (JSBACH, GERMANY; JULES, UK; ORCHIDEE, FRANCE). WE USE A SITE-LEVEL APPROACH IN WHICH COMPREHENSIVE, HIGH-FREQUENCY DATASETS ALLOW US TO DISENTANGLE THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT PROCESSES. THE MODELS HAVE IMPROVED PHYSICAL PERMAFROST PROCESSES AND THERE IS A REASONABLE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE SIMULATED AND MEASURED PHYSICAL VARIABLES, INCLUDING SOIL TEMPERATURE, SOIL MOISTURE AND SNOW. WE SHOW THAT IF THE MODELS SIMULATE THE CORRECT LEAF AREA INDEX (LAI), THE STANDARD C3 PHOTOSYNTHESIS SCHEMES PRODUCE THE CORRECT ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF CARBON FLUXES. THEREFORE, SIMULATING THE CORRECT LAI IS ONE OF THE FIRST PRIORITIES. LAI DEPENDS QUITE STRONGLY ON CLIMATIC VARIABLES ALONE, AS WE SEE BY THE FACT THAT THE DYNAMIC VEGETATION MODEL CAN SIMULATE MOST OF THE DIFFERENCES IN LAI BETWEEN SITES, BASED ALMOST ENTIRELY ON CLIMATE INPUTS. HOWEVER, WE ALSO IDENTIFY AN INFLUENCE FROM NUTRIENT LIMITATION AS THE LAI BECOMES TOO LARGE AT SOME OF THE MORE NUTRIENT-LIMITED SITES. WE CONCLUDE THAT INCLUDING MOSS AS WELL AS VASCULAR PLANTS IS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE TO THE CARBON BUDGET, AS MOSS CONTRIBUTES A LARGE FRACTION TO THE SEASONAL CO2 FLUX IN NUTRIENT-LIMITED CONDITIONS. MOSS PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACTIVITY CAN BE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THE MOISTURE CONTENT OF MOSS, AND THE CARBON UPTAKE CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM VASCULAR PLANTS WITH A SIMILAR LAI. THE SOIL CARBON STOCKS DEPEND STRONGLY ON THE RATE OF INPUT OF CARBON FROM THE VEGETATION TO THE SOIL, AND OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT AN IMPROVED SIMULATION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS WOULD ALSO LEAD TO AN IMPROVED SIMULATION OF SOIL CARBON STOCKS. HOWEVER, THE STOCKS ARE ALSO INFLUENCED BY SOIL CARBON BURIAL (E.G. THROUGH CRYOTURBATION) AND THE RATE OF HETEROTROPHIC RESPIRATION, WHICH DEPENDS ON THE SOIL PHYSICAL STATE.

THE ACTIVE LAYER SOIL SHOWED A RANGE OF PARTICLE SIZES WITH A PEAK AT 229 MU M, AND THIS WAS SIMILAR TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF PARTICLES IN THE UPPER PERMAFROST CORES. THE PARTICLE SPECTRUM FOR THE LAKE WATER OVERLAPPED WITH THOSE FOR THE SOIL, BUT EXTENDED TO LARGER (SURFACE WATER) OR FINER (BOTTOM WATER) PARTICLES. ON AVERAGE, MORE THAN 50% OF THE BACTERIAL CELLS AND BACTERIAL PRODUCTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PARTICLES > 3 MU M. THIS RELATIVELY LOW CONTRIBUTION OF FREE-LIVING CELLS (OPERATIONALLY DEFINED AS THE < 1 MU M FRACTION) TO BACTERIAL PRODUCTION WAS A GENERAL FEATURE OF ALL OF THE NORTHERN LAKES SAMPLED, INCLUDING OTHER THAW LAKES AND SHALLOW ROCK-BASIN LAKES (AVERAGE +/- SE OF 25 +/- 6 %). HOWEVER, A DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF THE PEATLAND THAW LAKES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BACTERIAL SPECIFIC GROWTH RATES, WHICH AVERAGED 4 TO 7 TIMES HIGHER VALUES THAN IN THE OTHER LAKE TYPES. THE IN SITU ENRICHMENT EXPERIMENT SHOWED NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ORGANIC CARBON OR PHOSPHORUS ENRICHMENT TREATMENTS AT DAY 5 RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL, HOWEVER THERE WAS AN APPARENT INCREASE IN BACTERIAL GROWTH RATES BETWEEN DAYS 1 AND 5 IN THE SOIL AND THE CARBON PLUS PHOSPHORUS ENRICHMENTS. COLLECTIVELY THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT PARTICLES, NUTRIENTS AND CARBON ARE RELEASED BY DEGRADING PERMAFROST PEATLAND SOILS INTO THEIR ASSOCIATED THERMOKARST LAKES, CREATING FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR PRODUCTION BY PARTICLE-BASED AS WELL AS FREE-LIVING AQUATIC BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES.

IN ADDITION, WE INCLUDED DATA FROM A REWETTED PEATLAND WHERE THE DEGRADED PEAT HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM ABOUT HALF OF THE AREA AND GROUNDWATER LEVEL WAS JUST BENEATH THE SOIL SURFACE. 3. THE RESULTS EMPHASIZED THAT FOLLOWING INUNDATION NEWLY FORMED DETRITUS MUD LAYERS OVERLYING THE FORMER PEAT SURFACE ARE THE DOMINATING SOURCE FOR P AND METHANE IN PARTICULAR IN SITES WITHOUT TSR BUT ALSO IN SITES WITH TSR, ALTHOUGH AT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RATES. ALTHOUGH HIGHLY DECOMPOSED PEAT RELEASED MORE OR LESS NO METHANE, DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER MOBILIZATION WAS HIGHEST IN THIS SUBSTRATE WHILE LESS DECOMPOSED PEAT WAS CHARACTERIZED IN GENERAL BY LOWEST RATES OF MOBILIZATION. 4.

WE DEVELOPED A SIMPLE DECISION SUPPORT SCHEMATIC TO ASSIST THE PEATLAND RESTORATION PROCESS AND TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF TOP SOIL REMOVAL. DESPITE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS, TOP SOIL REMOVAL SHOULD NOT BE DECLARED AS A UNIVERSAL METHOD, AS IT REQUIRES DETAILED CONSIDERATION PRIOR TO APPLICATION.

PEATLAND MARGINS DOMINATED BY LOCAL GROUNDWATER FLOW FROM ADJACENT PEATLAND MIDDLES WERE CHARACTERIZED BY DYNAMIC HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS THAT, WHEN COUPLED WITH LOWERED PEATLAND MARGIN SURFACE ELEVATIONS DUE TO DEEP BURNING, PRODUCED TWO COMMON HYDROLOGICAL STATES: 1) FLOODING DURING WET PERIODS AND 2) RAPID WATER TABLE DECLINES DURING DRY PERIODS. THESE DYNAMIC HYDROLOGICAL STATES WERE UNFAVORABLE TO PEATLAND MOSS RECOLONIZATION AND BRYOPHYTES TYPICAL OF POST-FIRE RECOVERY IN MINERAL UPLANDS BECAME ESTABLISHED.

FYM, SLURRY, PEAT, COMPOST) OR SOIL MANAGEMENT (TILLAGE VS. NO-TILL). THE TREATMENTS WERE APPLIED TO DIFFERENT, DIVERSE CROP ROTATIONS OR GRASS MIXTURES THAT ARE REPRESENTATIVE FOR SWITZERLAND. WE FOUND THAT TOPSOILS LOST C AT AN AVERAGE RATE OF 0.29 MG C HA(-1) YR(-1), ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE INVESTIGATED TREATMENTS WERE EXPECTED TO LEAD TO SOC INCREASES. BASED ON A LINEAR MIXED EFFECTS MODEL WE SHOWED THAT SOC CHANGE RATES (DELTA SOC) WERE DRIVEN BY C INPUTS TO SOIL (HARVEST RESIDUES AND ORGANIC FERTILIZER), SOIL COVER AND INITIAL SOC STOCKS. THE TYPE OF LAND USE OR SOIL TILLAGE HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT CURRENT EFFORTS TO MANAGE SOILS SUSTAINABLY NEED TO BE INTENSIFIED AND COMPLEMENTED WITH FURTHER TECHNIQUES IF SWITZERLAND WANTS TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF THE 4 PER 1000 INITIATIVE.","LOSS OF SOIL ORGANIC CARBON IN SWISS LONG-TERM AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENTS OVER A WIDE RANGE OF MANAGEMENT PRACTICES","AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","ARTICLE","DEC 1",2019,"10.1016/j.agee.2019.106654","AGRICULTURE, MULTIDISCIPLINARY; ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000500215400008"

OUR AIMS WERE TO MEASURE RATE OF RECOVERY TOWARDS BOG CONDITIONS AND TO IDENTIFY THE BEST SUITE OF WATER CHEMISTRY VARIABLES TO INDICATE RECOVERY. OUR RESULTS SHOW PROGRESS IN RECOVERY TOWARDS BOG CONDITIONS OVER A 0-17 YEAR PERIOD POST-RESTORATION. ELEMENTS SCAVENGED BY TREES (MG, NA, S) COMPLETELY RECOVERED WITHIN THAT PERIOD.

THE DATA WERE SUMMARIZED BY BOG, POOR FEN AND RICH-INTERMEDIATE FEN CATEGORIES FOR THE SEVEN MAJOR PEATLAND CONTAINING TERRESTRIAL ECOZONES (ATLANTIC MARITIME, MIXEDWOOD PLAINS, BOREAL SHIELD, BOREAL PLAINS, HUDSON PLAINS, TAIGA SHIELD, TAIGA PLAINS) THAT COMPRISE > 96% OF ALL PEATLANDS NATIONALLY. REPORTS OF MULTIPLE YEARS OF DATA FROM A SINGLE SITE WERE AVERAGED AND DIFFERENT MICROFORMS (E.G., HUMMOCK OR HOLLOW) WITHIN THESE PEATLAND TYPES WERE KEPT SEPARATE. A NEW PEATLANDS MAP WAS CREATED FROM FOREST COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE INFORMATION THAT DISTINGUISHES BOG FROM RICH AND POOR FEN. NATIONAL FOREST INVENTORY K-NN FOREST STRUCTURE MAPS, BIOCLIMATIC VARIABLES (MEAN DIURNAL RANGE AND SEASONALITY OF TEMPERATURES) AND GROUND SURFACE SLOPE WERE USED TO CONSTRUCT THE NEW MAP. THE EARTH OBSERVATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT MAP OF WETLANDS WAS USED TO IDENTIFY OPEN PEATLANDS WITH MINOR TREE COVER. RESULTS: THE NEW MAP WAS COMBINED WITH AVERAGES OF OBSERVED NEE AND CH4 EMISSIONS TO ESTIMATE A GROWING SEASON INTEGRATED NEE (+/- SE) AT - 108.8 (+/- 41.3) MT CO2 SEASON(-1) AND CH4 EMISSION AT 4.1 (+/- 1.5) MT CH4 SEASON(-1) FOR THE SEVEN ECOZONES. CONVERTING CH4 TO CO2 EQUIVALENT (CO2 E; GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL OF 25 OVER 100 YEARS) RESULTED IN A TOTAL NET SINK OF - 7.0 (+/- 77.6) MT CO2 E SEASON(-1) FOR CANADA. BOREAL PLAINS PEATLANDS CONTRIBUTED MOST TO THE NEE SINK DUE TO HIGH CO2 UPTAKE RATES AND LARGE PEATLAND AREAS, WHILE BOREAL SHIELD PEATLANDS CONTRIBUTED MOST TO CH4 EMISSIONS DUE TO MODERATE EMISSION RATES AND LARGE PEATLAND AREAS.

IN THIS RESEARCH, SOIL OF DIFFERENT DEPTHS FROM ZOIGE PLATEAU WAS INCUBATED IN FOUR SCENARIOS (8 DEGREES C-ANAEROBIC, 8 DEGREES C-AEROBIC, 18 DEGREES C-ANAEROBIC AND 18 DEGREES C-AEROBIC) TO DETECT THE EXPORTED CARBON. OUR RESULT SHOWED THAT SOIL RESPIRATION (RS) INCREASED OBVIOUSLY WITH ENHANCED TEMPERATURE AND OXYGEN.

ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGISTS ARE CONTINUOUSLY ASSESSING HOW GLOBAL WARMING IS GOING TO IMPACT THE CURRENT POPULATION. PEATLANDS ARE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS WHICH MAKES ONLY 3% OF THEM BUT CONTAIN AROUND 40% OF SOIL ORGANIC CARBON. THE COMPOSITION OF PEATLAND VEGETATION IMPACTS A RANGE OF ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS, THEREFORE, WITH A CHANGE IN COMPOSITION, THE BEHAVIOR AND STRUCTURE OF PEATLAND PLANT COMMUNITIES ARE PREDICTED TO CHANGE. THIS WORK IS FOCUSED ON THE RESPONSE OF SPHAGNUM PEATLAND (IN POLAND), TO THE MANIPULATED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. THE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN CONSISTED OF FOUR TREATMENTS (CONTROL, WARMING, REDUCED PRECIPITATION, AND A COMBINATION OF WARMING & REDUCED PRECIPITATION), THREE REPLICATES OF EACH. ACTIVE WARMING WITH INFRARED HEATERS ((SIMILAR TO)1.0-1.4 DEGREES C PEAT TEMPERATURE INCREASE) AND AN AUTOMATIC CURTAIN TO REDUCE PRECIPITATION ((SIMILAR TO)30% REDUCTION IN THE RAIN) WAS APPLIED CONTINUOUSLY SINCE 2015. THE WARMING AND REDUCED PRECIPITATION CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN THE VEGETATION INDICES SUCH AS NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX (NDVI), PHOTOCHEMICAL REFLECTANCE INDEX (PRI), WATER BAND INDEX (WBI), AND CHLOROPHYLL GREEN INDEX (CIGREEN) BETWEEN MANIPULATED SITES. THE ABUNDANCE OF MAJOR PLANT SPECIES WAS RECORDED BETWEEN MANIPULATED SITES. THE PROMPT CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE MEASUREMENT WAS PERFORMED IN THE PEAK OF THE VEGETATION SEASON OF AUGUST 2017 WHICH HAD SHOWN A SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN PHOTOSYNTHETIC INDUCTION CURVE AND DIFFERENT PHOTOSYNTHETIC PARAMETERS FROM THE SAME PLANT SPECIES IN BETWEEN THE MANIPULATED SITES. THE DATA CLEARLY INDICATE THAT A SHORT-TERM CLIMATE MANIPULATION RESULTED IN THE CHANGE OF PLANT ABUNDANCE AND ITS PHYSIOLOGY, WHICH VARIED FOR DIFFERENT PLANT SPECIES.

VASCULAR PLANTS, WHICH OFTEN DOMINATE RESTORED SITES, PLAY A KEY ROLE IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF EMITTED CH4: THE PLANTS CAN EITHER FUEL METHANOGENESIS BY SUPPLYING LABILE CARBON OR ATTENUATE METHANOGENESIS BY TRANSFERRING OXYGEN INTO THE RHIZOSPHERE. TO QUANTIFY THE NET EFFECT OF THESE COUNTERACTING PROCESSES, WE TESTED IN A TWO-PRONGED APPROACH CH4 PRODUCTION, EMISSION, AND THE UNDERLYING PROCESSES IN (1.)

WHILE INORGANIC ELECTRON ACCEPTOR POOLS WERE SMALL AND RAPIDLY DIMINISHED, DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER PROVIDED CONSTANT ELECTRON ACCEPTOR CAPACITY, INDICATING THAT REDUCIBLE MOIETIES IN THE ORGANIC MATTER WERE CONTINUOUSLY RE-OXIDIZED IN THE RHIZOSPHERE OF ALL TESTED VASCULAR PLANT SPECIES.

HERE, WE PRESENT A NEW MODEL OF HOLOCENE SEDIMENT DYNAMICS IN THE BARRIER-REEF LAGOON OF BORA BORA BASED ON SEDIMENTOLOGICAL, PALEONTOLOGICAL, GEOCHRONOLOGICAL AND GEOCHEMICAL DATA. THE LAGOONAL SUCCESSION STARTED WITH A PLEISTOCENE SOIL REPRESENTING THE LOWSTAND SYSTEMS TRACT. AS THE RISING HOLOCENE SEA INUNDATED THE CARBONATE PLATFORM, PEAT ACCUMULATED LOCALLY SIMILAR TO 10,650-9400 YEARS BP. MIXED CARBONATE-SILICICLASTIC SEDIMENTATION STARTED CA. 8700-5500 YEARS BP AND REPRESENTS THE TRANSGRESSIVE SYSTEMS TRACT. DURING THAT TIME, SEDIMENTS WERE CHARACTERIZED BY RELATIVELY COARSE GRAIN SIZE AND CONTAINED HIGH AMOUNTS OF TERRESTRIAL MATERIAL FROM THE VOLCANIC HINTERLAND AS WELL AS CARBONATE SEDIMENTS MAINLY PRODUCED WITHIN THE LAGOON. SILICICLASTIC CONTENT DECREASES THROUGHOUT THE HOLOCENE. AFTER THE RISING SEA HAD REACHED ITS MODERN LEVEL, SAND APRONS FORMED BETWEEN REEF CREST AND LAGOON CREATING TRANSPORT PATHWAYS FOR REEF-DERIVED MATERIAL LEADING TO CARBONATE-DOMINATED SEDIMENTATION CA. 6000-3009 YEARS BP DURING THE HIGHSTAND SYSTEMS TRACT. HOWEVER, MAINLY FINE MATERIAL WAS TRANSPORTED AND ACCUMULATED IN THE LAGOON WHILE COARSER GRAINS WERE RETAINED ON THE PROGRADING SAND APRON. FROM CA. 4500-500 YEARS BP, SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN GRAIN-SIZE, TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON AS INDICATOR FOR PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY, CA AND CL ELEMENT INTENSITIES AS QUALITATIVE INDICATORS FOR CARBONATE AVAILABILITY AND LAGOONAL SALINITY ARE SEEN. SUCH PATTERNS COULD INDICATE EVENT (RE-)DEPOSITION AND CORRELATE WITH CONTEMPORANEOUS EVENT DEPOSITS FOUND IN THE LAGOON OF NEARBY TAHAA, WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO BE INDUCED BY ELEVATED CYCLONE ACTIVITY. CORRESPONDINGLY, ENHANCED EROSION AND RUN-OFF FROM THE VOLCANIC HINTERLAND AS WELL AS LOWER LAGOONAL SALINITY WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH INTENSE RAINFALL DURING REPEATED CYCLONE LANDFALL. INCREASED AMOUNTS OF COARSE-GRAINED SEDIMENT FROM MARGINAL REEF AREAS WOULD BE TRANSPORTED INTO THE LAGOON.

ALSO, BENTHIC FORAMINIFERAL FAUNAS DO NOT VALIDATE REEF-TO-LAGOON TRANSPORT OF SEDIMENT.

ENHANCED SOIL EROSION OCCURRED AT SIMILAR TO AD 1660-1800 (SE1), SIMILAR TO AD 1830-1920 (SE2) AND SIMILAR TO AD 1940-1970 (SE3), ALTHOUGH A MINOR INCREASE IN SI FLUXES WAS ALSO DETECTED BY SIMILAR TO AD 1460-1580. ALL PHASES COINCIDED WITH HIGHER ABUNDANCES OF FIRE INDICATORS, BUT THE CHANGES RECORDED DURING THE SIMILAR TO AD 1460-1580 EVENT AND SE1 COINCIDE WITH THE SPORER AND MAUNDER MINIMA, SO A CLIMATIC INFLUENCE ON SOIL EROSION CANNOT BE DISCOUNTED.

THE HIGHEST EMISSIONS OCCURRED WHEN THE WATER TABLE WAS MAINTAINED 15 CM BELOW THE SURFACE (168 +/- 11 KG CO2-E HA(-1) D(-1)), AS THIS STIMULATED N2O LOSS. PLACEMENT OF HORTICULTURAL FLEECE OVER THE SOIL SURFACE DURING SPRING HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON GWP100, BUT PROLONGED FLEECE APPLICATION EXACERBATED GHG EMISSIONS.

FOR MAXIMUM ABATEMENT POTENTIAL, MITIGATION MEASURES SHOULD BE APPLIED DURING THE GROWING SEASON, WHEN GHG EMISSIONS ARE GREATEST.

OLD C (>1,000YEARS BP) MAY BE MASKED BY POSTBOMB C (FIXED FROM THE ATMOSPHERE POST-1950 CE), POTENTIALLY RENDERING BULK AQUATIC DISSOLVED ORGANIC C (DOC) C-14 MEASUREMENTS INSENSITIVE TO OLD C. WE COLLECTED DOC WITH A MODERN C-14 SIGNATURE FROM A TEMPERATE SCOTTISH PEATLAND STREAM AND DECOMPOSED IT TO PRODUCE CO2 UNDER SIMULATED NATURAL CONDITIONS OVER 140DAYS. WE MEASURED THE C-14 OF BOTH DOC AND CO2 AT SEVEN TIME POINTS AND FOUND THAT WHILE DOC REMAINED CLOSE TO MODERN IN AGE, THE RESULTANT CO2 PROGRESSIVELY INCREASED IN AGE UP TO 2,356767YEARS BP. THE RESULTS OF THIS EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATE THAT THE BULK (DOC)-C-14 POOL CAN HIDE THE PRESENCE OF OLD C WITHIN PEATLAND STREAM DOC EXPORT, DEMONSTRATING THAT BULK (DOC)-C-14 MEASUREMENTS CAN BE AN INSENSITIVE INDICATOR OF PEATLAND DISTURBANCE. OUR EXPERIMENT ALSO DEMONSTRATES THAT THIS OLD C COMPONENT IS BIOLOGICALLY AND PHOTOCHEMICALLY AVAILABLE FOR CONVERSION TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS CO2, AND AS SUCH, BULK (DOC)-C-14 MEASUREMENTS DO NOT REFLECT THE C-14 SIGNATURE OF THE LABILE ORGANIC C POOL EXPORTED BY INLAND WATER SYSTEMS MORE BROADLY. MOREOVER, OUR EXPERIMENT SUGGESTS THAT OLD C MAY BE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF CO2 EMISSIONS TO THE ATMOSPHERE FROM PEATLAND AQUATIC SYSTEMS, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR TRACING AND MODELING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE HYDROLOGICAL AND TERRESTRIAL C CYCLES. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY THE INTRODUCTION OF OLD CARBON PREVIOUSLY STORED IN SOILS FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS INTO RIVERS CAN INCREASE THE NET FLUX OF GREENHOUSE GASES TO THE ATMOSPHERE, IMPACTING GLOBAL CLIMATE. THIS IS BECAUSE RIVERS TRANSPORT THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE THIRD OF HUMAN CARBON EMISSIONS ANNUALLY FROM LAND TO THE OCEANS. MUCH RIVER-BORNE CARBON IS PLANT AND SOIL (ORGANIC) MATTER THAT CAN DECOMPOSE DURING TRANSPORT, RELEASING GREENHOUSE GASES TO THE ATMOSPHERE. RADIOCARBON DATING CAN REVEAL THE AGE OF RIVER-BORNE CARBON, BUT PREVIOUS MEASUREMENTS MAY HAVE UNDERESTIMATED THE AGE OF CARBON RELEASED INTO RIVERS BY NOT CONSIDERING THE POTENTIAL FOR OLD CARBON HIDDEN WITHIN INDIVIDUAL BULK WATER SAMPLES. USING AN INCUBATION EXPERIMENT, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON FROM A SCOTTISH PEATLAND STREAM THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED MODERN IN AGE USING TRADITIONAL BULK RADIOCARBON DATING CAN READILY DECOMPOSE TO PRODUCE CARBON DIOXIDE WITH AN OLD RADIOCARBON SIGNATURE UP TO SIMILAR TO 2,500YEARS OLD. THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT RADIOCARBON DATING OF BULK RIVERINE DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON CAN HIDE THE PRESENCE OF OLD CARBON.

THE ABILITY TO ASSESS ECOSYSTEM CARBON BALANCE CAN HELP LAND MANAGERS UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS AND TRADEOFFS BETWEEN DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. THIS PAPER DEMONSTRATES AN APPLICATION OF THE LAND USE AND CARBON SCENARIO SIMULATOR (LUCAS) MODEL DEVELOPED FOR LOCAL-SCALE LAND MANAGEMENT AT THE GREAT DISMAL SWAMP NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE. WE ESTIMATE THE NET ECOSYSTEM CARBON BALANCE BY CONSIDERING PAST ECOSYSTEM DISTURBANCES RESULTING FROM STORM DAMAGE, FIRE, AND LAND MANAGEMENT ACTIONS INCLUDING HYDROLOGIC INUNDATION, VEGETATION CLEARING, AND REPLANTING. RESULTS: WE MODELED THE ANNUAL ECOSYSTEM CARBON STOCK AND FLOW RATES FOR THE 30-YEAR HISTORIC TIME PERIOD OF 1985-2015, USING AGE-STRUCTURED FOREST GROWTH CURVES AND KNOWN DATA FOR DISTURBANCE EVENTS AND MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. THE 30-YEAR TOTAL NET ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTION WAS ESTIMATED TO BE A NET SINK OF 0.97 TG C. WHEN A HURRICANE AND SIX HISTORIC FIRE EVENTS WERE CONSIDERED IN THE SIMULATION, THE GREAT DISMAL SWAMP BECAME A NET SOURCE OF 0.89 TG C. THE CUMULATIVE ABOVE AND BELOW-GROUND CARBON LOSS ESTIMATED FROM THE SOUTH ONE AND LATERAL WEST FIRE EVENTS TOTALED 1.70 TG C, WHILE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES REMOVED AN ADDITIONAL 0.01 TG C. THE CARBON LOSS IN BELOW-GROUND BIOMASS ALONE TOTALED 1.38 TG C, WITH THE BALANCE (0.31 TG C) COMING FROM ABOVE-GROUND BIOMASS AND DETRITUS. CONCLUSIONS: NATURAL DISTURBANCES SUBSTANTIALLY IMPACT NET ECOSYSTEM CARBON BALANCE IN THE GREAT DISMAL SWAMP. THROUGH ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT ACTIONS SUCH AS RE-WETTING, BELOW-GROUND BIOMASS LOSS MAY HAVE BEEN AVOIDED, RESULTING IN THE ADDED CARBON STORAGE CAPACITY OF 1.38 TG. BASED ON TWO MODEL ASSUMPTIONS USED TO SIMULATE THE PEAT SYSTEM, (A BURN SCAR TOTALING 70 CM IN DEPTH, AND THE SOIL CARBON ACCUMULATION RATE OF 0.36 T C/HA(-1)/YEAR(-1) FOR ATLANTIC WHITE CEDAR), THE TOTAL SOIL CARBON LOSS FROM THE SOUTH ONE AND LATERAL WEST FIRES WOULD TAKE APPROXIMATELY 1740 YEARS TO RE-AMASS. DUE TO THE IMPRACTICAL TIME HORIZON THIS PRESENTS FOR LAND MANAGERS, THIS PARTICULAR LOSS IS CONSIDERED PERMANENT.

A QUESTION ARISES IF THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY OF PEAT WHICH IS USED FOR ARTIFICIAL SOIL PREPARATION AFFECTS THE MEASURED VALUES OF BAFS. IN THIS STUDY THE EFFECT OF SOIL MICROORGANISMS ON BIOAVAILABILITY OF HOCS WAS STUDIED AND A PORTION OF EACH SOIL WAS STERILIZED BY GAMMA IRRADIATION. RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE STERILIZATION PROCESS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE FATE OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS (PAHS; PHENANTHRENE AND PYRENE) AND INCREASED BIOAVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPOUNDS TO EARTHWORMS WITH BAFS SEVERAL TIMES HIGHER IN THE STERILE SOILS COMPARED TO THEIR NON-STERILE VARIANTS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT STERILIZATION OF SOILS CAN BE USED AS THE ""WORST-CASE SCENARIO"" FOR LABORATORY TESTS OF TOXICITY OR BIOACCUMULATION OF BIODEGRADABLE HOCS SUCH AS PAHS.

HOWEVER, TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, NO STUDIES HAVE COMPARED THE USE OF BIOCHAR FROM GASIFICATION AND TORREFACTION AS GROWING MEDIA COMPONENT FOR GROWING MEDIA FORMULATION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK WAS TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF TWO BIOCHARS ON PEAT-BASED GROWING MEDIA: A PINEWOOD GASIFICATION BIOCHAR (BG) AND A BIOCHAR (BT) OBTAINED BY TORREFACTION OF THE ORGANIC FRACTION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE. GROWING MEDIA MIXING PT (PEAT) WITH 50%VOL OF BG OR BT WERE PREPARED AND CHARACTERIZED ACCORDING TO THEIR CHEMICAL, THERMAL AND HYDROPHYSICAL PROPERTIES. PHYTOTOXIC EXPERIMENTS AND GROWTH OF LOLIUM PERENNE WERE ALSO PERFORMED. RESULTS INDICATED THAT PEAT SUBSTITUTION IN GROWING MEDIA BY BG AND BT AT A 50%VOL RATIO IMPROVED THEIR HYDROPHYSICAL PROPERTIES. SPECIFICALLY, BULK DENSITY INCREASED MORE THAN 50%, AIR SPACE INCREASED BY 43%, THE INCREMENT OF THE TOTAL POROSITY WAS 20%, AND, FINALLY, THE WATER HOLDING CAPACITY INCREASED BY 18.3%. SIGNIFICANTLY, A POSITIVE EFFECT ON PLANT BIOMASS PRODUCTION (YIELD INCREMENT: 274%) WAS OBSERVED AFTER ADDITION OF BT, WHEREAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED AFTER ADDITION OF BG BIOCHAR. THEREFORE, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT BOTH BT AND BG COULD BE USED AS PEAT SUBSTITUTES IN GROWING MEDIA FORMULATION.","VALORIZATION OF BIOCHARS FROM PINEWOOD GASIFICATION AND MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE TORREFACTION AS PEAT SUBSTITUTES","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH","ARTICLE","SEP",2018,"10.1007/s11356-018-2703-x","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000443329100072"

THIS DETERMINATION RELIES ON DATA ABOUT STRATIGRAPHY AND PEAT PROPERTIES, WHICH ARE CONVENTIONALLY COLLECTED BY CORING. GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR (GPR) AND ELECTRICAL RESISTIVITY IMAGING (ERI) CAN SUPPORT THESE POINT DATA BY PROVIDING SUBSOIL INFORMATION IN TWO-DIMENSIONAL CROSS-SECTIONS. IN THIS STUDY, GPR AND ERI WERE CONDUCTED AT TWO GROUNDWATER-FED FEN SITES LOCATED IN THE TEMPERATE ZONE IN NORTH-EAST GERMANY. THE FENS OF THIS REGION ARE EMBEDDED IN LOW CONDUCTIVE GLACIAL SAND AND ARE CHARACTERISED BY THICK LAYERS OF GYTTJA, WHICH CAN BE EITHER MINERAL OR ORGANIC. THE TWO STUDY SITES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THIS REGION WITH RESPECT TO STRATIGRAPHY (TOTAL THICKNESS, PEAT AND GYTTJA TYPES) AND ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS (PH-VALUE, TROPHIC CONDITION). THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE SUITABILITY OF GPR AND ERI TO DETECT STRATIGRAPHY AND PEAT PROPERTIES UNDER THESE CHARACTERISTIC SITE CONDITIONS. RESULTS SHOW THAT GPR CLEARLY DETECTS THE INTERFACES BETWEEN (I) CAREX AND BROWN-MOSS PEAT, (II) BROWN-MOSS PEAT AND ORGANIC GYTTJA, (III) ORGANIC- AND MINERAL GYTTJA, AND (IV) MINERAL GYTTJA AND THE PARENT MATERIAL (GLACIAL SAND). THESE LAYERS DIFFER IN BULK DENSITY AND THE RELATED ORGANIC MATTER CONTENT. ERI, HOWEVER, DOES NOT DELINEATE THESE LAYERS; RATHER IT DELINEATES REGIONS OF VARYING PROPERTIES. AT OUR BASE-RICH SITE, PORE FLUID CONDUCTIVITY AND CATION.EXCHANGE CAPACITY ARE THE MAIN FACTORS THAT DETERMINE PEAT ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY (REVERSE OF RESISTIVITY), WHEREAS ORGANIC MATTER AND WATER CONTENT ARE MOST INFLUENTIAL AT THE MORE ACIDIC SITE. THUS THE CORRELATION BETWEEN PEAT PROPERTIES AND ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY ARE DRIVEN BY SITE-SPECIFIC CONDITIONS, WHICH ARE MAINLY DETERMINED BY THE SOLUTE LOAD IN THE GROUNDWATER AT FENS. WHEN THE TOTAL ORGANIC DEPOSITS EXCEED A THICKNESS OF 5 M, THE DEPTH OF INVESTIGATION BY GPR IS LIMITED DUE TO INCREASING ATTENUATION. THIS IS NOT A LIMITING FACTOR FOR ERI, WHERE THE TRANSITION FROM ORGANIC DEPOSITS TO GLACIAL SAND IS VISIBLE AT BOTH SITES. DUE TO THESE SPECIFIC SENSITIVITIES, A COMBINED APPLICATION OF GPR AND ERI MEETS THE DEMAND FOR UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON CARBON STORAGE OF PEATLANDS, WHICH IS, MOREOVER, VERY SITE-SPECIFIC BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT VARIETY OF ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND STRATIGRAPHY BETWEEN PEATLANDS IN GENERAL AND BETWEEN FENS AND BOGS IN PARTICULAR.

MICROBIAL BIOMASS CARBON (MBC) AND V-MAA OF BETA-GLUCOSIDASE AND N-ACETYL GLUCOSAMINIDASE INCREASED BY 30-70% FROM HUMMOCKS AND LAWNS TO HOLLOWS IN THE TOP 15 CM, CONTRADICTING THE HYPOTHESIS. SIMILARLY, K-M AND THE CATALYTIC EFFICIENCY OF ENZYMES (K-A = V-MAX/K-M) WERE BEST RELATED TO MBC DISTRIBUTION AND NOT TO THE AERATION GRADIENT. WITH DEPTH, V-AMA OF BETA-GLUCOSIDASE, XYLOSIDASE AND LEUCINE AMINOPEPTIDASE FOLLOWED THE HYPOTHESIZED PATTERN IN HOLLOWS. IN CONTRAST, MBC WAS 1.3-4 TIMES HIGHER AT 50 CM, FOLLOWED BY SUCCESSIVELY LOWER CONTENTS AT 15 AND 200 CM IN ALL MICROFORMS. THE SAME DEPTH PATTERN CHARACTERIZED THE V-AMA DISTRIBUTION OF 6 OUT OF 8 ENZYMES. PHOSPHATASE ACTIVITY DECREASED FROM DRIER HUMMOCK TO WETTER HOLLOWS AND THE HIGHER ACTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE PEAT PROFILE SUGGESTED A HIGH MICROBIAL DEMAND FOR P. ENZYME ACTIVITIES AND CATALYTIC EFFICIENCY IN PEAT WERE CLOSELY LINKED TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF MICROBIAL BIOMASS WITH DEPTH, WHICH IN TURN WAS BEST EXPLAINED BY P CONTENT. FROM THE ECOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE, THESE RESULTS CLEARLY SHOW THAT PEAT DECOMPOSITION WILL BE ACCELERATED WHEN MICROBIAL ACTIVITY IS STIMULATED E.G.

THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF (I) MIXING PEAT WITH SAND AND (II) WATER TABLE DEPTH (WTD) ON DOC CONCENTRATIONS AT THREE GRASSLAND SITES ON SHALLOW ORGANIC SOILS.

THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF SOIL ORGANIC CARBON (SOC) CONTENT OR WTD ON MEAN DOC CONCENTRATIONS. AT ALL SITES, DOC CONCENTRATIONS WERE HIGHEST AT THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE SOC-RICH HORIZON AND THE MINERAL SUBSOIL. IN CONTRAST TO THE MEAN CONCENTRATIONS, THE TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF DOC CONCENTRATIONS, THEIR DRIVERS AND THE PROPERTIES OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER (DOM) DIFFERED BETWEEN PEAT-SAND MIXTURES AND PEAT.

AT THE SITES WITH A PEAT-SAND MIXTURE, TEMPERATURE AND THEREFORE PROBABLY BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY DETERMINED THE DOC CONCENTRATIONS. AT THE PEAT SITE, THE CONTRIBUTION OF VEGETATION DERIVED DOM WAS HIGHER. THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS OCCURRED DURING LONG, COOL PERIODS OF WATERLOGGING, SUGGESTING A STRONGER PHYSICOCHEMICAL-BASED DOC MOBILISATION.

IN CLEAR-CUTTING, STEM WOOD IS REMOVED AND THE LOGGING RESIDUES ARE EITHER REMOVED OR LEFT ON SITE. CLEAR-CUTTING CHANGES THE MICROCLIMATE AND VEGETATION STRUCTURE AT THE SITE, BOTH OF WHICH AFFECT THE SITE'S CARBON BALANCE. PEAT SOILS WITH POOR AERATION AND HIGH CARBON DENSITIES ARE ESPECIALLY PRONE TO SUCH CHANGES, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN GREENHOUSE GAS EXCHANGE CAN BE EXPECTED. WE MEASURED CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) AND ENERGY FLUXES WITH THE EDDY COVARIANCE METHOD FOR 2 YEARS (APRIL 2016-MARCH 2018) AFTER CLEAR-CUTTING A DRAINED PEATLAND FOREST. WE OBSERVED A SIGNIFICANT RISE (23 CM) IN THE WATER TABLE LEVEL AND A LARGE CO2 SOURCE (FIRST YEAR: 3086 +/- 148 G CO2 M(-2) YR(-1); SECOND YEAR: 2072 +/- 124 G CO2 M(-2) YR(-1)). THESE LARGE CO2 EMISSIONS RESULTED FROM THE VERY LOW GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION (GPP) FOLLOWING THE REMOVAL OF PHOTOSYNTHESIZING TREES AND THE DECLINE OF GROUND VEGETATION, UNABLE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE DECOMPOSITION OF LOGGING RESIDUES AND PEAT.

IN APRIL-SEPTEMBER, THE MEAN DAYTIME SENSIBLE HEAT FLUX WAS 33% LOWER AND LATENT HEAT FLUX 40% HIGHER IN 2017, PROBABLY DUE TO THE RECOVERY OF GROUND VEGETATION THAT INCREASED EVAPOTRANSPIRATION AND ALBEDO OF THE SITE.

FOR THE PURPOSE, AUTHENTIC SOIL ORGANIC MATTER (HUMUS AND PEAT) WAS INCUBATED IN MESH BAGS UNDER PILES AND AT CONTROL PLOTS. THE EFFECT OF PILES WAS ASSUMED TO RESULT FROM PHYSICAL (SHADING AND INSULATION ON SOIL SURFACE) AND CHEMICAL-BIOLOGICAL (LEACHING OF NUTRIENTS AND FRESH ORGANIC MATTER) SOURCES. TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO, ARTIFICIAL PILES OF INORGANIC MATTER WERE ESTABLISHED TO MIMIC THE BARE PHYSICAL EFFECTS. ENHANCEMENT OF DECOMPOSITION IN THE SOIL UNDER THE REAL AND ARTIFICIAL PILES WAS ASSESSED BY MEASURING THE MASS LOSS OF CELLULOSE STRIPS. LOGGING RESIDUE PILES HAD CLEAR PHYSICAL EFFECTS ON SOIL: TEMPERATURES WERE LOWERED AND THEIR DIURNAL VARIATION SUBDUED, AND RELATIVE HUMIDITY AT THE SOIL SURFACE WAS HIGHER. THE EFFECT ON SOIL MOISTURE WAS ALSO EVIDENT, BUT MORE VARIABLE, INCLUDING BOTH DECREASES AND INCREASES.

IN THESE CONTEXTS, A PREFERENCE FOR SALINITY-RESISTANT SPECIES AND CULTIVATION TECHNIQUES BASED ON THE SUBSTITUTION OF LOW-IMPACT MATERIALS COULD BE BENEFICIAL.

FOR THIS STUDY, A TOTAL OF 154 COAL CORE SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM THREE RESEARCH WELLS THAT WERE DRILLED IN THE TECTONICALLY COMPLEX SETTINGS OF THE KOZLU COALFIELD. ALL THE COAL SAMPLES WERE STUDIED BY MEANS OF COAL PETROGRAPHY, MINERALOGY, AND GEOCHEMISTRY. SPECIAL ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO THE COMPOSITIONS AND ORIGINS OF FRACTURE/CLEAT-FILLING MINERALS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED BY SEM-EDX ON POLISHED BLOCKS. THE COAL SEAMS INVESTIGATED ARE OF BITUMINOUS RANK. THEY ARE CHARACTERIZED BY LOW TOTAL SULPHUR CONTENTS (<= 1.0%, ON DRY BASIS) AND HIGH GROSS CALORIFIC VALUES (22.5-40.2 MJ/KG, ON DRY, ASH-FREE BASIS), WHEREAS ASH YIELDS AND VOLATILE MATTER CONTENTS ARE VARIABLE. X-RAY POWDER DIFFRACTION DATA INDICATE THAT THE MINERALOGICAL COMPOSITIONS OF THE STUDIED COAL SEAMS ARE RATHER SIMILAR, AND CLAY MINERALS, ALONG WITH QUARTZ AND CARBONATE MINERALS, WERE IDENTIFIED IN ALMOST ALL SEAMS. THE STATISTICAL EVALUATIONS AND SEM DATA SHOW THAT SOME ELEMENTS SUCH AS MG, TI, ZR, NB, AND TH ARE GENERALLY AFFILIATED WITH SILICATE MINERALS, WHEREAS ELEMENTS LIKE CU, ZN, MO, AND PB ARE MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH SULPHIDE MINERALS.

WE MEASURED THE DECOMPOSITION OF THREE COMMON PEATLAND PLANT FUNCTIONAL TYPES (MOSS, SEDGE, SHRUB), AND ASSOCIATED MICROARTHROPOD COMMUNITIES USING LITTERBAGS PLACED IN HOLLOWS (WET DEPRESSIONS) AND HUMMOCKS (DRY, RAISED AREAS) OF A BOREAL PEATLAND IN ONTARIO, CANADA. DECOMPOSITION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN ALL PLANT LITTER TYPES, AND GREATEST IN SEDGE, BUT WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN HUMMOCK AND HOLLOW MICROHABITATS. THE DECOMPOSER COMMUNITY DISPLAYED AN OPPOSITE PATTERN, SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY MICROHABITAT WHERE RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF MICROARTHROPODS WAS GREATER IN HOLLOWS THAN HUMMOCKS. ORIBATID MITES WERE THE DOMINANT MICROARTHROPOD WITH RESPECT TO BOTH RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE. PLANT LITTER TYPE DID NOT AFFECT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN HOLLOWS, BUT WAS A DETERMINANT OF ORIBATID DOMINANCE IN HUMMOCKS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ABIOTIC ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ARE THE MAIN DRIVERS OF COMMUNITY STRUCTURE FOR DECOMPOSERS, WHILE PLANT LITTER QUALITY IS A MORE IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF DECOMPOSITION DYNAMICS IN BOREAL PEATLANDS.","DRIVERS OF DECOMPOSITION AND THE DETRITAL INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY DIFFER ACROSS A HUMMOCK-HOLLOW MICROTOPOLOGY IN BOREAL PEATLANDS","ECOSCIENCE","ARTICLE","MAR",2018,"10.1080/11956860.2017.1412282","ECOLOGY","WOS:000423613800004"

THEY PROVIDE IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES INCLUDING CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND STORAGE. DRAINAGE DISTURBS PEATLAND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. MAPPING DRAINS IS DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE AND THEIR SPATIAL EXTENT IS, IN MANY CASES, UNKNOWN. AN OBJECT BASED IMAGE ANALYSIS (OBIA) WAS PERFORMED ON A VERY HIGH RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGE (GEOEYE-1) TO EXTRACT INFORMATION ABOUT DRAIN LOCATION AND EXTENT ON A BLANKET PEATLAND IN IRELAND. TWO ACCURACY ASSESSMENT METHODS: ERROR MATRIX AND THE COMPLETENESS, CORRECTNESS AND QUALITY (CCQ) WERE USED TO ASSESS THE EXTRACTED DATA ACROSS THE PEATLAND AND AT SEVERAL SUB SITES. THE COST OF THE OBIA METHOD WAS COMPARED WITH MANUAL DIGITISATION AND FIELD SURVEY. THE DRAIN MAPS WERE ALSO USED TO ASSESS THE COSTS RELATING TO BLOCKING DRAINS VS. A BUSINESS-AS-USUAL SCENARIO AND ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF EACH ON CARBON FLUXES AT THE STUDY SITE. RESULTS: THE OBIA METHOD PERFORMED WELL AT ALMOST ALL SITES. ALMOST 500 KM OF DRAINS WERE DETECTED WITHIN THE PEATLAND. IN THE ERROR MATRIX METHOD, OVERALL ACCURACY (OA) OF DETECTING THE DRAINS WAS 94% AND THE KAPPA STATISTIC WAS 0.66. THE OA FOR ALL SUB-AREAS, EXCEPT ONE, WAS 95-97%. THE CCQ WAS 85%, 85% AND 71% RESPECTIVELY. THE OBIA METHOD WAS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO MAP PEATLAND DRAINS AND WAS AT LEAST 55% CHEAPER THAN EITHER FIELD SURVEY OR MANUAL DIGITISATION, RESPECTIVELY. THE EXTRACTED DRAIN MAPS WERE USED CONSTRAIN THE STUDY AREA CO(2 )FLUX WHICH WAS 19% SMALLER THAN THE PRESCRIBED PEATLAND CODE VALUE FOR DRAINED PEATLANDS. CONCLUSIONS: THE OBIA METHOD USED IN THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACCURATELY EXTRACT MAPS OF FINE SCALE PEATLAND DRAINS OVER LARGE AREAS IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER. THE DEVELOPMENT OF METHODS TO MAP THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF DRAINS IS IMPORTANT AS THEY PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN PEATLAND CARBON DYNAMICS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXTRACT DATA ON THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF DRAINS ON A BLANKET BOG IN THE WEST OF IRELAND.

WE FIND TOTAL BIOMASS BURNING HG EMISSIONS TO BE HIGHLY VARIABLE FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND ESTIMATE AVERAGE 2010-2015 TOTAL ATMOSPHERIC BIOMASS BURNING EMISSIONS OF HG IN CANADA TO BE BETWEEN 6 AND 14 T DURING THE BIOMASS BURNING SEASON (I.E. FROM MAY TO SEPTEMBER), WHICH IS 37 TIMES THE MERCURY EMISSION FROM ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES IN CANADA FOR THIS PERIOD. ON AVERAGE, 65% OF THE EMISSIONS OCCUR IN THE PROVINCES WEST OF ONTARIO. WE FIND THAT WHILE EMISSIONS FROM BIOMASS BURNING HAVE A SMALL IMPACT ON SURFACE AIR CONCENTRATIONS OF GEM AVERAGED OVER INDIVIDUAL PROVINCES/TERRITORIES, THE IMPACT AT INDIVIDUAL SITES CAN BE AS HIGH AS 95% DURING BURNING EVENTS. WE ESTIMATE AVERAGE ANNUAL MERCURY DEPOSITION FROM BIOMASS BURNING IN CANADA TO BE BETWEEN 0.3 AND 2.8 T, COMPARED TO 0.14 T OF MERCURY DEPOSITION FROM ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES DURING THE BIOMASS BURNING SEASON IN CANADA. COMPARED TO THE BIOMASS BURNING EMISSIONS, THE RELATIVE IMPACT OF FIRES ON MERCURY DEPOSITION IS SHIFTED EASTWARD, WITH ON AVERAGE 54% PERCENT OF THE DEPOSITION OCCURRING IN PROVINCES WEST OF ONTARIO. WHILE THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF CANADIAN BIOMASS BURNING TO THE TOTAL MERCURY DEPOSITION OVER EACH PROVINCE/TERRITORY IS NO MORE THAN 9% BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015, THE LOCAL CONTRIBUTION IN SOME LOCATIONS (INCLUDING AREAS DOWNWIND OF BIOMASS BURNING) CAN BE AS HIGH AS 80% (E.G. NORTHWEST OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE IN 2014) FROM MAY TO SEPTEMBER. WE FIND THAT NORTHERN ALBERTA AND SASKATCHEWAN, CENTRAL BRITISH COLUMBIA, AND THE AREA AROUND GREAT SLAVE LAKE IN THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES ARE AT GREATER RISK OF MERCURY CONTAMINATION FROM BIOMASS BURNING. GEM IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE DOMINANT MERCURY SPECIES EMITTED FROM BIOMASS BURNING; HOWEVER, THERE REMAINS AN UNCERTAINTY IN THE SPECIATION OF MERCURY RELEASED FROM BIOMASS BURNING. WE FIND THAT THE IMPACT OF BIOMASS BURNING EMISSIONS ON MERCURY DEPOSITION IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE UNCERTAINTY IN SPECIATION OF EMITTED MERCURY BECAUSE PBM IS MORE READILY DEPOSITED CLOSER TO THE EMISSION SOURCES THAN GEM; AN ADDITION OF SIMILAR TO 18% PERCENT OF MERCURY EMISSION FROM BIOMASS BURNING IN THE FORM OF PBM IN THE MODEL INCREASES THE 6-YEAR AVERAGE DEPOSITION BY SIMILAR TO 4 TIMES.","HOW IMPORTANT IS BIOMASS BURNING IN CANADA TO MERCURY CONTAMINATION?","ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS","ARTICLE","MAY 25",2018,"10.5194/acp-18-7263-2018","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; METEOROLOGY & ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES","WOS:000433159600004"

NO CHANGES IN AERATION DEPTH OR VEGETATION PARAMETERS WERE DETECTED AS A FUNCTION OF DITCH BLOCKING, TIME SINCE BLOCKING, OR DISTANCE FROM THE DITCH, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NON-SPHAGNUM BRYOPHYTES WHICH HAD LOWER COVER IN QUADRATS ADJACENT TO DITCHES THAT HAD BEEN BLOCKED FOR 5 YEARS. ANALYSIS OF LIDAR DATA AND THE OBSERVED PROXIMITY OF THE WATER TABLE TO THE PEAT SURFACE LED US TO CONCLUDE THAT THE SUBDUED ECOSYSTEM RESPONSES TO DITCH-BLOCKING WERE THE RESULT OF HISTORICAL PEAT SUBSIDENCE WITHIN A 4-5 M ZONE EITHER SIDE OF EACH DITCH, WHICH HAD EFFECTIVELY LOWERED THE PEAT SURFACE TO THE NEW, DITCH INFLUENCED WATER TABLE. WE ESTIMATE THAT THIS PROCESS LED TO THE LOSS OF AROUND 500,000 M(3) PEAT WITHIN THE 38 KM(2) STUDY AREA FOLLOWING DRAINAGE, DUE TO A COMBINATION OF OXIDATION AND COMPACTION. ASSUMING THAT 50% OF THE VOLUME LOSS WAS DUE TO OXIDATION, THIS AMOUNTS TO A CARBON LOSS OF 11,000 MG C OVER THIS AREA, I.E. 3 MG C HA(-1). THE APPARENT 'SELF-REWETTING' OF BLANKET BOGS IN THE DECADES FOLLOWING DRAINAGE HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THEIR RESTORATION AS IT SUGGESTS THAT THERE MAY NOT BE LARGE QUANTITIES OF DRY PEAT LEFT TO REWET, AND THAT THERE IS A RISK OF INUNDATION (POTENTIALLY LEADING TO HIGH METHANE EMISSIONS) ALONG SUBSIDED DITCH LINES. MANY PEATLAND PROCESSES ARE LIKELY TO BE MAINTAINED IN DRAINED BLANKET BOG, INCLUDING SUPPORT OF TYPICAL PEATLAND VEGETATION, BUT INFILLING OF LOST PEAT AND RECOVERY OF ORIGINAL C STOCKS ARE LIKELY TO TAKE LONGER THAN IS GENERALLY ANTICIPATED.

THE TOTAL (CO2)-C-14 LOSS FROM SOIL INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH INCREASING TEMPERATURE DURING 72-H INCUBATION, REGARDLESS OF PEAT LAYER THICKNESS. WARMING ALTERED THE DYNAMICS OF LMWOS MINERALIZATION BY CHANGING C ALLOCATION AND THE TURNOVER RATE OF DIFFERENT MICROBIAL C POOLS.

LEAF AREA INDEX INCREASED FROM A GROWING SEASON PEAK OF 0.9 IN 2003 TO 4.0 IN 2014 AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED GROWING SEASON GROSS ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY (4.9 TO 8.9G C M(-2) DAY(-1)), AN INCREASED EVAPOTRANSPIRATION (1.6 TO 3.4MM DAY(-1)), AND A DECREASED PARTITIONING OF ENERGY TO SENSIBLE HEAT (BOWEN'S RATIO DECREASED FROM 1.1 TO 0.4). ALTHOUGH CANOPY CONDUCTANCE INCREASED THROUGHOUT THE 12YEARS, THE SHIFT FROM EARLY SUCCESSIONAL SPECIES TO TREES WITH MORE CONSERVATIVE WATER USE RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN CONDUCTANCE NORMALIZED BY LEAF AREA. WATER USE EFFICIENCY HAS INCREASED SLIGHTLY SINCE 2008 WITH AN AVERAGE OF 10.0G CO2 KG(-1) H2O FOR THE LAST 6 YEARS. NO PROLONGED DRY PERIODS WERE OBSERVED DURING THE STUDY PERIOD.

TREATMENTS USED WERE THE SIX COMBINATIONS OF DAMMING OR NOT DAMMING PLOUGH FURROWS WITH LEAVING THE TREES ALIVE, FELLING AND LEAVING THEM ON THE GROUND OR FELLING AND REMOVING THEM. COMBINING FELLING WITH DAMMING FURROWS WAS MOST SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING THE WATER TABLE, WHETHER OR NOT THE FELLED TREES WERE REMOVED. ONLY WHERE FELLING WAS COMBINED WITH DAMMING DID THE WATER TABLE CONTINUE TO RECOVER BETWEEN YEARS 5 AND 10. OVER TEN YEARS, THE WATER LEVEL IN THESE TREATMENTS ROSE TO SLIGHTLY BELOW THAT OF NON-AFFORESTED REFERENCE BOG AT THE SAME SITES. THIS OCCURRED AS A RAPID INITIAL RISE, FOLLOWING WHICH THERE WAS ONLY VERY SLIGHT FURTHER IMPROVEMENT. FELLING CAUSED THE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF THE VEGETATION TO CHANGE TOWARDS THAT OF THE REFERENCE BOGS. THE PROCESS WAS SLOW, WITH THE VEGETATION BECOMING MORE DISSIMILAR TO NON-FORESTED REFERENCE BOG IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS AND THEN BECOMING MORE SIMILAR TO THE REFERENCE BOG AFTER YEAR 5. SURPRISINGLY, DAMMING PLOUGH FURROWS HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON THE VEGETATION EXCEPT THAT, IN COMBINATION WITH FELLING, IT INCREASED DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE PLOUGH FURROWS AND OTHER POSITIONS ON THE PLOUGHED GROUND. CONIFER SEEDLINGS ESTABLISHED ON THE RESTORED PLOTS, MOST DENSELY WHERE THEY ADJOINED STANDING FOREST, AND HAD SIMILAR DENSITY AND GROWTH IN ALL THE FELLED TREATMENTS. THE RESTORATION TREATMENTS RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN BULK DENSITY AND INCREASE IN WATER CONTENT OF THE UPPER PEAT, PROBABLY DUE TO AN UNLOADING EFFECT CAUSED BY THE RAISED WATER TABLE BUOYING UP THE DRAINED PEAT LAYER. IN SOME TREATMENTS THIS WAS AMPLIFIED BY REMOVAL OF THE WEIGHT OF THE TREES.

USING A FEN CONSTRUCTED IN THE POST-MINING LANDSCAPE OF THE ATHABASCA OIL SANDS REGION, A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO QUANTIFY THE FLUXES OF CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), METHANE (CH4) AND NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) DURING THE PEAK GROWING SEASONS OVER THE FIRST TWO YEARS FOLLOWING REVEGETATION. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF REVEGETATION STRATEGIES AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS ON THE FEN GHG EMISSIONS OVER THE GROWING SEASON. RELATIVE TO A NATURAL FEN, OUR RESULTS SHOW SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER FLUXES OF CH4 (P < 0.001), WHICH CORRELATE WITH HIGHER BULK DENSITY, LOWER ORGANIC MATTER CONTENT, AND HIGHER PH AND SO42- CONCENTRATION IN THE CONSTRUCTED FEN. REVEGETATION DID NOT STIMULATE CH4 PRODUCTION, BUT INCREASED CO2 UPTAKE AND REDUCED N2O EMISSIONS RELATIVE TO THE NON-VEGETATED CONTROL. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT REVEGETATION STRATEGIES AND WATER CHEMISTRY MIGHT BE MORE IMPORTANT CONTROLS ON GHG FLUXES THAN SUBSTRATE QUALITY IN A CONSTRUCTED FEN. ALTHOUGH THE CURRENT EDAPHIC CONDITIONS IN THE CONSTRUCTED FEN SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL FOR A NET UPTAKE OF GHGS OVER THE GROWING SEASON, ADDITIONAL MONITORING IS REQUIRED TO EVALUATE IF THESE CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST IN THE LONG-TERM.

WE QUANTIFIED VERTICAL PATTERNS OF N CHEMISTRY IN A MINEROGENIC MIRE, ESTIMATED THE SEASONAL AND ANNUAL HYDROLOGIC EXPORT OF ORGANIC AND INORGANIC N FROM THIS SYSTEM, AND EVALUATED THE BROADER INFLUENCE OF MIRE COVER ON N CHEMISTRY ACROSS A STREAM NETWORK. RELATIVELY HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF AMMONIUM (UP TO 2 MG L(-1)) WERE OBSERVED IN GROUNDWATER SEVERAL METERS BELOW THE PEAT SURFACE, AND N WAS ROUTED TO THE OUTLET STREAM ALONG DEEP, PREFERENTIAL FLOWPATHS. AREAL ESTIMATES OF INORGANIC N EXPORT FROM THE MIRE WERE SEVERAL TIMES GREATER THAN FROM AN ADJACENT, FORESTED CATCHMENT, WITH MARKEDLY HIGHER LOSS RATES DURING THE GROWING SEASON, WHEN PLANT N DEMAND IS OSTENSIBLY GREATEST. AT BROADER SCALES, MIRE COVER WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH LONG-TERM CONCENTRATIONS OF INORGANIC AND ORGANIC N IN STREAMS ACROSS THE DRAINAGE NETWORK. THIS STUDY PROVIDES AN EXAMPLE OF HOW MIRE FORMATION AND PEAT ACCUMULATION CAN CREATE BROAD-SCALE HETEROGENEITY IN NUTRIENT SUPPLY AND DEMAND ACROSS BOREAL LANDSCAPES.

THE DAILY CH4 EXCHANGE RANGED FROM 1.8 MG CH4 M(-2) D(-1) TO 40.2 MG CH4 M(-2) D-1 IN 2014 AND RANGED FROM 3.9 TO 15.0 MG CH4 M(-2) D(-1) IN 2015. THERE WERE NO PEAKS OF CH4 FLUXES DURING THE SPRING THAWING PERIOD. HOWEVER; LARGE PEAKS OF CH4 EMISSION WERE FOUND IN THE SECOND HALF OF BOTH GROWING SEASONS.

LOCATION: RICH FEN NEAR FORT MCMURRAY, ALBERTA, CANADA. METHODS: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SUBMERGENCE DURATION ON FEN MOSS SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES, WE HARVESTED AND SUBMERGED MONOCULTURE PLUGS DOMINATED BY HAMATOCAULIS VERNICOSUS, SPHAGNUM WARNSTORFII, TOMENTYPNUM NITENS AND AULACOMNIUM PALUSTRE IN THE FIELD UNDER RICH FEN WATER FOR 1-8 WEEKS.

RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT MOSS SPECIES RESPONSE TO DURATION OF SUBMERGENCE IS NOT STRICTLY RELATED TO THEIR OCCURRENCE ALONG A HUMMOCK-HOLLOW GRADIENT AND THAT TOLERANT SPECIES MAINTAIN OR RESTORE MOSS COVER. H. VERNICOSUS WAS MOST TOLERANT TO SUBMERGENCE OF ALL DURATIONS, WHEREAS S. WARNSTORFII WAS NEARLY ELIMINATED BY SUBMERGENCE.

THE ABOVE-AND BELOW-GROUND STRUCTURE, SOIL CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS, AND PORE WATER CONSTITUENTS IN VEGETATED NATURAL MARSH SEDIMENTS AND SAND-AMENDED SEDIMENTS WERE EXAMINED AT VARYING INUNDATION REGIMES BETWEEN MEAN SEA LEVEL AND MEAN HIGH WATER (0.82 M NAVD88 TO 1.49 M NAVD88) IN A FIELD EXPERIMENT AT LAWS POINT, PART OF THE PLUM ISLAND SOUND ESTUARY (MA). SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SALINITIES, PH, SULFIDES, PHOSPHATES, AND AMMONIUM WERE MEASURED IN THE SAND-AMENDED SEDIMENTS THAN IN THE NATURAL SEDIMENTS. IN NATURAL SEDIMENTS THERE WAS A PATTERN OF INCREASING SALINITY WITH INCREASING ELEVATION WHILE IN THE SAND-AMENDED SEDIMENTS THE TREND WAS REVERSED, SHOWING DECREASING SALINITY WITH INCREASING ELEVATION. SULFIDE CONCENTRATIONS GENERALLY INCREASED FROM LOW TO HIGH INUNDATION WITH HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS AT THE HIGHEST INUNDATION (I. E., AT THE LOWEST ELEVATIONS).

FOR SEVERAL DECADES, THIS HAS MADE THE ISSUE OF WETLAND EVOLUTION OF PARTICULAR INTEREST AMONG THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WORLDWIDE. A NUMBER OF AUTHORS HAVE STUDIED DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF WETLAND GEOCHEMISTRY AND EVOLUTION: THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF BOG WATER AND PEAT, INCLUDING NUTRIENT DYNAMICS, BOG VEGETATION, HYDROLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS, AND THE MINERALOGICAL COMPOSITION OF PEAT. HOWEVER, SOME ISSUES REMAINED INSUFFICIENTLY STUDIED, INCLUDING THE DISTRIBUTION OF CHEMICAL ELEMENTS IN PEAT DEPOSITS AND, PARTICULARLY, THE CAUSES OF THE FORMATION OF SOME MINERALS IN THE PEAT DEPOSITS. TO RESEARCH THESE ISSUES, WE ESTIMATED THE GEOCHEMICAL CONDITIONS OF THE FORMATION OF SOME MINERALS IN THE OLIGOTROPHIC PINE-SHRUB-SPHAGNUM BOG AND ADJACENT AREA (PART OF THE VASYUGAN SWAMP, WESTERN SIBERIA) IN THE WINTER PERIOD OF 2017 AND 2018. IT WAS REVEALED THAT THERE WERE NO LESS THAN TWO COMPLEX GEOCHEMICAL BARRIERS IN THE PEAT DEPOSIT. THESE BARRIERS CORRESPOND TO CHANGES IN ADVECTIVE AND DIFFUSION FLOWS AND RESULT IN THE ACCUMULATION OF FE AND SOME OTHER CHEMICAL ELEMENTS IN THE PEAT DEPOSIT. THE UPPER COMPLEX GEOCHEMICAL BARRIER OF REDOX, SULFIDE, AND SORPTION TYPE IS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY AT A DEPTH OF 0.40-1.25 M. THE BOTTOM BARRIER, WHICH IS THE COMBINATION OF COMPLEX GEOCHEMICAL BARRIER OF ALKALINE AND SORPTION TYPE WITH MECHANICAL BARRIER, ARE LOCATED AT THE BOTTOM LAYER OF THE PEAT DEPOSIT, AT A DEPTH OF 2.25-2.50 M. ACCUMULATION OF SUBSTANCES IN THE UPPER GEOCHEMICAL BARRIER IS ALWAYS LESS SIGNIFICANT THAN IN THE BOTTOM BARRIER. THEREFORE, THE PROBABILITY OF DETECTING HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF VARIOUS SUBSTANCES IS VERY HIGH IN THE BOTTOM PART OF THE PEAT DEPOSIT, THE ORGANOMINERAL SEDIMENTS, AND THE UPPER PART OF THE UNDERLYING MINERAL GROUND.","GEOCHEMICAL BARRIERS IN OLIGOTROPHIC PEAT BOG (WESTERN SIBERIA)","APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY","ARTICLE","FEB",2020,"10.1016/j.apgeochem.2019.104519","GEOCHEMISTRY & GEOPHYSICS","WOS:000514814800028"

WE COMPARED THE RESPONSES OF DOMINANT MICROBIAL CONSUMERS (TESTATE AMOEBAE) TO DRAINAGE DITCH RESTORATION RELATIVE TO UNBLOCKED DITCHES IN A UK UPLAND BLANKET PEATLAND (MIGNEINT, NORTH WALES). TWO TECHNIQUES WERE USED FOR RESTORATION: (I) DAMMED DITCHES WITH RE-PROFILING; AND (II) DAMMED DITCHES WITH POOLS OF OPEN WATER BEHIND EACH DAM.

ALTHOUGH THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE VARIABILITY IN THE RESPONSE OF TESTATE AMOEBAE COMMUNITIES TO PEATLAND DRAIN BLOCKING, THERE WERE CLEARLY MORE PRONOUNCED CHANGES IN SAMPLES FROM THE DAMMED AND REPROFILED TREATMENTS INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN DIVERSITY, AND THE APPEARANCE OF UNAMBIGUOUS WET-INDICATOR SPECIES IN RELATIVELY HIGH ABUNDANCES (INCLUDINGAMPHITREMA STENOSTOMA, ARCHERELLA FLAVUM, ARCELLA DISCOIDES TYPE, DIFFLUGIA BACILLIFERA AND DIFFLUGIA BACILLARIUM).

HOWEVER, THE RELATIONS OF BM AND BMP TO WT VARIATION ARE POORLY KNOWN. HERE WE INVESTIGATED, HOW THE ABOVE- AND BELOW-GROUND BM AND BMP OF THREE DIFFERENT PLANT FUNCTIONAL TYPES (PFTS), DWARF SHRUBS, SEDGES AND SPHAGNUM MOSSES, RELATE TO NATURAL WT VARIATION WITHIN AN OMBROTROPHIC BOREAL BOG. IN ADDITION, WE ESTIMATED ECOSYSTEM-LEVEL BMP AND COMPARED THAT WITH ECOSYSTEM NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION (NPP) DERIVED FROM EDDY COVARIANCE (EC) MEASUREMENTS. LOCATION: SIIKANEVA BOG, RUOVESI, FINLAND. METHODS: WE QUANTIFIED ABOVE- AND BELOW-GROUND BM AND BMP OF PFTS ALONG THE WT GRADIENT, DIVIDED INTO SIX PLANT COMMUNITY TYPES. PLANT COMMUNITY SCALE BM AND BMP WERE UP-SCALED TO THE ECOSYSTEM LEVEL. NPP WAS DERIVED FROM EC MEASUREMENTS USING A LITERATURE-BASED RATIO OF HETEROTROPHIC RESPIRATION TO TOTAL ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION. RESULTS: BM VARIED FROM 211 TO 979 G/M(2) AMONG THE PLANT COMMUNITY TYPES, DECREASING GRADUALLY FROM DRY TO WET COMMUNITY TYPES. IN CONTRAST, BMP WAS SIMILAR BETWEEN PLANT COMMUNITY TYPES (162-216 G/M(2)), EXCEPT ON NEARLY VEGETATION-FREE BARE PEAT SURFACES WHERE IT WAS LOW (38 G/M(2)). VASCULAR PLANT BM TURNOVER RATE (BMP:BM, PER YEAR) VARIED FROM 0.14 TO 0.30 AMONG THE PLANT COMMUNITY TYPES, BEING HIGHEST IN SEDGE-DOMINATED HOLLOWS. ON AVERAGE 56% OF THE VASCULAR BM WAS PRODUCED BELOW GROUND. MOSSES, WHEN PRESENT, PRODUCED ON AVERAGE 31% OF THE TOTAL BM, RANGING FROM 16% TO 53% DEPENDING ON COMMUNITY TYPE.

CONCLUSIONS: WE FOUND THAT THE DIVERSITY OF PFTS DECREASES THE SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN PRODUCTIVITY OF A BOREAL BOG ECOSYSTEM.

SIMULTANEOUSLY, EC MEASUREMENTS OF NEE WERE CONDUCTED ON THE SITES. TWO REASONS FOR OCCASIONALLY GREAT DEVIATIONS IN NEE BETWEEN THE METHODS COULD BE OBSERVED: (1) THE ACCORDANCE OF BOTH METHODS WAS MOST HAMPERED DURING TRANSITION PERIODS SUCH AS THE BEGINNING OF THE GROWING SEASON AND THE ONSET OF REGROWTH AFTER A GRASSLAND DEFOLIATION DUE TO DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES OF EC AND CHAMBER MEASUREMENTS AND (2) R-ECO AND GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION (GPP) PARTITIONED FROM EC NEE MEASUREMENTS WERE SYSTEMATICALLY LOWER THAN THOSE FROM THE CHAMBER-BASED MODEL, WHICH COULD BE A RESULT OF THE EC ENERGY BALANCE GAP.

HYDROPRIMING AND OSMOPRIMING IMPROVED SEED GERMINATION, SEEDLING GROWTH, BIOMASS PRODUCTION, CHLOROPHYLL INTENSITY, SUGAR ACCUMULATION AND REDUCED THE OXIDATIVE STRESS IN LENTIL UNDER WATER DEFICIT. HOWEVER, OSMOPRIMING (1% CACL2) WAS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE HYDROPRIMING IN IMPROVING THE LENTIL GROWTH, BIOMASS PRODUCTION, CA ACCUMULATION AND SUGAR METABOLISM UNDER BOTH WELL-WATERED AND WATER DEFICIT CONDITIONS. SEED SURFACE DRYING, AFTER PRIMING, WAS MORE BENEFICIAL IN IMPROVING THE LENTIL PERFORMANCE, UNDER BOTH WELL-WATERED AND WATER DEFICIT CONDITIONS, THAN RE-DRYING TO ORIGINAL WEIGHT. OSMOPRIMING (1% CACL2) INCREASED THE SEEDING DRY WEIGHT (67%), SPAD VALUE (140%), LEAF CA CONCENTRATION (56%), ALPHA-AMYLASE ACTIVITY (55%), TOTAL SOLUBLE SUGARS (48%) AND REDUCED MALANODIALDEHYDE CONTENT (35.9%) AND TOTAL ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY (29.2%) THAN UN-PRIMED SEEDS UNDER WATER DEFICIT. IN CONCLUSION, OSMOPRIMING IMPROVED THE LENTIL PERFORMANCE UNDER OPTIMAL AND WATER DEFICIT CONDITIONS THROUGH EARLY AND SYNCHRONIZED EMERGENCE, BETTER SUGAR AND CA ACCUMULATION WHICH REDUCED THE OXIDATIVE DAMAGE AND RESULTED IN BETTER SEEDLING GROWTH AND BIOMASS PRODUCTION.","MORPHOLOGICAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ASPECTS OF OSMOPRIMING-INDUCED DROUGHT TOLERANCE IN LENTIL","JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE","ARTICLE","APR",2020,"10.1111/jac.12384","AGRONOMY","WOS:000502025500001"

TUNDRA WILDFIRE COULD ALTER TERRESTRIAL SILICA (SIO2) CYCLING BY RESTRUCTURING SURFACE VEGETATION AND BY DEEPENING THE SEASONALLY THAWED ACTIVE LAYER. THESE CHANGES COULD INFLUENCE THE AVAILABILITY OF SILICA IN TERRESTRIAL PERMAFROST ECOSYSTEMS AND ALTER LATERAL EXPORTS TO DOWNSTREAM MARINE WATERS, WHERE SILICA IS OFTEN A LIMITING NUTRIENT. IN THIS CONTEXT, WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF THE LARGEST ARCTIC TUNDRA FIRE IN RECENT TIMES ON PLANT AND PEAT AMORPHOUS SILICA CONTENT AND DISSOLVED SILICA CONCENTRATION IN STREAMS. TEN YEARS AFTER THE FIRE, VEGETATION IN BURNED AREAS HAD 73% MORE SILICA IN ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS COMPARED TO ADJACENT, UNBURNED AREAS. THIS INCREASE IN PLANT SILICA WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PLANT SILICA CONCENTRATION IN BRYOPHYTES AND INCREASED PREVALENCE OF SILICA-RICH GRAMMINOIDS IN BURNED AREAS. TUNDRA FIRE REDISTRIBUTED PEAT SILICA, WITH BURNED AREAS CONTAINING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AMORPHOUS SILICA CONCENTRATIONS IN THE O-LAYER, BUT 29% LESS SILICA IN PEAT OVERALL DUE TO SHALLOWER PEAT DEPTH POST BURN. DESPITE THESE DRAMATIC DIFFERENCES IN TERRESTRIAL SILICA DYNAMICS, DISSOLVED SILICA CONCENTRATION IN TRIBUTARIES DRAINING BURNED CATCHMENTS DID NOT DIFFER FROM UNBURNED CATCHMENTS, POTENTIALLY DUE TO THE INCREASED UPTAKE BY TERRESTRIAL VEGETATION. TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TUNDRA WILDFIRE ENHANCES TERRESTRIAL AVAILABILITY OF SILICA VIA PERMAFROST DEGRADATION AND ASSOCIATED WEATHERING, BUT THAT CHANGES IN LATERAL SILICA EXPORT MAY DEPEND ON VEGETATION UPTAKE DURING THE FIRST DECADE OF POSTWILDFIRE SUCCESSION. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE ARCTIC IS LEADING TO MORE FREQUENT AND SEVERE WILDFIRE IN ARCTIC TUNDRA ECOSYSTEMS. STUDYING THE SILICA (SIO2) CYCLE IN ARCTIC ECOSYSTEMS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF SILICA EXPORTED FROM LAND TO SEA CAN CONTROL UPTAKE BY MARINE PRIMARY PRODUCERS IN ARCTIC COASTAL WATERS. WE INVESTIGATED HOW TUNDRA WILDFIRE AFFECTS SILICA CYCLING BY RETURNING TO A LARGE ARCTIC WILDFIRE 10 YEARS AFTER THE BURN TO COLLECT SAMPLES OF STREAM WATER, VEGETATION, AND PEAT. WE FOUND THAT PLANTS GROWING ON BURNED LANDSCAPES CONTAINED 73% MORE SILICA IN THEIR ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS COMPARED TO UNBURNED AREAS NEARBY. WHILE THE FIRE THAWED PERMAFROST UNDERNEATH IT, WE DID NOT OBSERVE INCREASED LEVELS OF SILICA IN STREAMS DRAINING BURNED AREAS. THIS PATTERN INDICATES THAT ELEVATED RATES OF SILICA UPTAKE VIA PLANTS MAY PREVENT INCREASED SILICA EXPORT TO MARINE WATERS FOLLOWING TUNDRA WILDFIRE. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE EFFECT OF TUNDRA FIRE ON SILICA CYCLING DEPENDS ON THE RECOVERY TRAJECTORIES OF TERRESTRIAL AND AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS IN THE ARCTIC. KEY POINTS AFTER THE LARGEST ARCTIC TUNDRA FIRE IN RECENT TIMES, BURNED VEGETATION HAD 73% MORE SILICA IN ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS, DUE TO HIGHER PLANT SILICA CONCENTRATION IN BRYOPHYTES AND INCREASED PREVALENCE OF SILICA-RICH GRAMMINOIDS IN BURNED AREAS WILDFIRE REDISTRIBUTED PEAT SILICA STOCKS, WITH HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS, BUT 29% LOWER TOTAL STOCKS DUE TO SHALLOWER PEAT LAYER POSTBURN DISSOLVED SILICA CONCENTRATION IN TRIBUTARIES DRAINING BURNED CATCHMENTS DID NOT DIFFER FROM UNBURNED CATCHMENTS, INDICATING THAT ACCELERATED VEGETATION UPTAKE MAY LIMIT LATERAL SILICA EXPORT DURING THE FIRST DECADE OF POST WILDFIRE SUCCESSION","PLANT UPTAKE OFFSETS SILICA RELEASE FROM A LARGE ARCTIC TUNDRA WILDFIRE","EARTHS FUTURE","ARTICLE","SEP",2019,"10.1029/2019EF001149","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY; METEOROLOGY & ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES","WOS:000491418700003"

THE FCCM ARE DIFFERENTIATED FROM UNDERLYING, RELATIVELY HIGH VITRINITE MORANBAH COAL MEASURES, AND OVERLYING HIGHER INERTINITE RANGAL COAL MEASURES IN THE BOWEN BASIN BY THEIR INTERCALATION WITH ABUNDANT TUFF AND SILICICLASTIC PARTINGS AND INTERBEDS. BESIDES THIS, THERE IS LITTLE DESCRIBED ABOUT THE VARIATION IN THE ORGANIC COMPOSITION OF THE FCCM AND ITS CAUSES.

THE COALS ARE DOMINANTLY DULL WITH MINOR BRIGHT BANDS THAT ARE MORE ABUNDANT IN THE BURNGROVE FORMATION REPRESENTING A CHANGE IN PLANT COMPOSITION. THE MACERAL ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE COALS IN THE FAIR HILL FORMATION AND MIDDLE MAIN SEAMS ARE VITRINITE-RICH (80-90% MMF) ALBEIT WITH HIGH MINERAL MATTER SUGGESTING THE FORMATION OF PRECURSORY PEAT UNDER RISING WATER LEVELS AND WITH HIGH SEDIMENT (TUFF) INFLUX AND PRESERVATION. THE COALS IN THE BURNGROVE FORMATION HAVE AN INCREASED INERTINITE CONTENT (30% MUFF) BUT ARE ALSO HIGH IN MINERAL MATTER SUGGESTING A SHIFT TO INCREASED DECOMPOSITION ARISING FROM A FLUCTUATING WATER TABLE, POSSIBLY INCREASED ARIDITY AND/OR MICROBIAL ACTIVITY. TUFFS OCCUR THROUGHOUT, AND ALTHOUGH THEIR FREQUENCY IS HIGHER IN THE LOWER FAIR HILL FORMATION, THE PRESERVATION OF THICKER TUFFS IN THE UPPER BURNGROVE FORMATION INDICATES INCREASED INTENSITY OF VOLCANISM THAT COULD HAVE MODIFIED THE ENVIRONMENT. VARIATION IN CARBON ISOTOPE COMPOSITIONS SHOW A PARABOLIC TREND, FROM AROUND -24.1%A IN THE FAIR HILL FORMATION TO MORE VARIABLE VALUES IN THE MIDDLE MAIN SEAMS WITH AN OVERALL C-13-ENRICHMENT UPWARDS IN THE BURNGROVE FORMATION, PRIOR TO THE DELTA C-13 VALUES BECOMING NEGATIVE (DEPLETED BETWEEN -1 TO -4% FROM THE AVERAGE -24.1%0) IN THE TOP SEAMS AND INTO THE OVERLYING RANGAL COAL MEASURES. THE C-13-DEPLETION TREND IN THE UPPER PART OF THE SECTION IS UNEXPECTED IN VIEW OF CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN INERTINITE CONTENT OF THE COALS INDICATING THAT THE DELTA C-13 VALUES/PLANT COMPOSITION AND INERTINITE CONTENT ARE DECOUPLED, UNLESS THE INERTINITE ORIGIN IS FROM INTENSE MICROBIAL DECAY. SIMILAR STABLE CARBON ISOTOPE DEPLETION TRENDS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED ELSEWHERE IN AN EQUIVALENT STRATI GRAPHIC INTERVAL OF THE BOWEN BASIN SUGGESTING THAT THE CARBON ISOTOPE VALUES ARE RESPONDING TO GLOBAL CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE NEGATIVE EXCURSIONS IN CARBON ISOTOPES BEFORE THE P-T BOUNDARY.

THE STUDY SHOWS THAT THE STORAGE OF OC IN MINERAL SOILS LEADS TO THE SEQUESTRATION OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS (OP) SINCE SOM IN MINERAL SOILS IS VERY RICH IN P.

THE SPRINGFIELD COAL WAS FOUND TO BE MODERATELY LOW IN ASH YIELD AND HIGH IN TOTAL SULFUR CONTENT. PETROGRAPHICALLY, THE COAL IS HIGH IN VITRINITE CONTENT AND LOW IN LIPTINITE AND INERTINITE. PALYNOLOGICALLY, THE BED IS CO-DOMINATED BY SPORES OF ARBORESCENT LYCOPOD AND TREE FERN AFFINITIES. THE EXAMINATION OF CLOSELY-SPACED BENCH SAMPLES REVEALED VERTICAL SPECIES VARIATION WITHIN BOTH OF THESE PLANT GROUPS. LYCOSPORA MICROPAPILLATA + L. ORBICULA, BOTH OF WHICH WERE PRODUCED BY PARAIYCOPODITES, ARE MOST ABUNDANT IN BASAL COAL BENCHES, WHEREAS LYCOSPORA GRANULATE, PRODUCED BY LEPIDOPHLOIOS IS THE DOMINANT ARBORESCENT LYCOPOD SPORE THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE BED. THYMOSPORA PSEUDOTHIESSENII IS THE DOMINANT TREE FERN SPORE THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE COAL, WITH LAEVIGATOSPORITES GLOBOSUS BECOMING DOMINANT IN THE TOP-MOST COAL BENCHES. THE HERRIN COAL BED IS ALSO MODERATELY LOW IN ASH YIELD AND HIGH IN TOTAL SULFUR CONTENT. UNLIKE THE SPRINGFIELD COAL, IT CONTAINS TWO DISTINCT INORGANIC PARTINGS THAT HAVE REGIONAL EXTENT. THE HERRIN COAL ALSO HAS SEVERAL COAL BENCHES WITH INCREASED ASH AND SULFUR THAT WERE NOT PRESENT IN THE SPRINGFIELD COAL BED. PETROGRAPHICALLY, IT IS DOMINATED BY VITRINITE, WITH THE PARTINGS AND HIGH ASH COAL BENCHES CONTAINING MORE INERTINITE, AND LIPTINITE. PALYNOLOGICALLY, THE HERRIN COAL IS DOMINATED BY ARBORESCENT LYCOPOD SPORES WITH SUBDOMINANT TREE FERN SPORES. AS WITH THE SPRINGFIELD COAL, LYCOSPORA MICROPAPILLATA + L. ORBICULA ARE THE DOMINANT ARBORESCENT LYCOPOD SPORES AT THE BASE OF THE COAL, WITH LYCOSPORA GRANULATA DOMINATING THE REST OF THE BED. GRANASPORITES MEDIUS, WHICH WAS PRODUCED BY DIAPHORODENDRON AND SYNCHYSIDENDRON, OCCURS MORE FREQUENTLY IN THE HERRIN COAL BED, AND ARE MOST ABUNDANT IN, AND IN PROXIMITY TO, THE TWO INORGANIC PARTINGS. TREE FERN SPORES ARE LESS ABUNDANT IN THE HERRIN COAL, AND DO NOT DISPLAY ANY DISCERNABLE VERTICAL SPECIES VARIATION. COLLECTIVELY, BOTH THE SPRINGFIELD AND HERRIN COAL BEDS ARE INTERPRETED TO HAVE FORMED IN EXTENSIVE PLANAR, TOPOGENOUS MIRES. CONSISTENTLY SATURATED PEAT CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF BOTH PALEOMIRES ARE INDICATED BY THE HIGH VITRINITE CONTENTS, AND PREVALENCE OF ARBORESCENT LYCOPODS. THE DEPOSITION OF WIDESPREAD INORGANIC PARTINGS IN THE HERRIN COAL REPRESENTS SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN PEAT ACCUMULATION, WITH HIGH ASH COAL BENCHES REPRESENTING SMALLER, MORE LOCAL EVENTS. BOTH OF THE COALS ARE OVERLAIN BY BLACK, VERY ORGANIC-RICH (AVG. TOC +/- 20%) MARINE SHALES.

TO PROVIDE SALTMARSH PROTECTION AND ENSURE THE CONTINUING DELIVERY OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, THERE IS A NEED TO INCENTIVISE LAND MANAGERS TO STOCK ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSIBLE DENSITIES. WE THEREFORE INVESTIGATED THE POSSIBILITY OF AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL SCHEMES AND PAYMENTS FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES (PES) TO COMPENSATE FOR LOST LIVESTOCK REVENUE UNDER REDUCED GRAZING REGIMES AND PROVIDE CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND OTHER BENEFITS. THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO CONSIDER THE BENEFITS ARISING FROM A POTENTIAL CARBON MARKET TO SALTMARSHES, ALTHOUGH SIMILAR SCHEMES EXIST FOR PEATLAND AND WOODLAND. WE CALCULATED THE NET ECONOMIC BENEFIT (COSTS OF LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION ARE REMOVED FROM REVENUE) TO FARMERS OBTAINED FROM A HECTARE OF GRAZED SALTMARSH UNDER LOW (0.3 LIVESTOCK UNITS PER HECTARE PER YEAR), MODERATE (0.6), HIGH (1.0) AND VERY HIGH (2.0) STOCKING DENSITIES ACCOUNTING FOR LIVESTOCK REVENUE, CARBON BENEFITS, AND AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL SUBSIDIES. WE REPEATED THE PROCEDURE CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL BENEFITS TRANSFERRED FROM THE LITERATURE IN TERMS OF PROVISIONING, REGULATING AND CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES PROVIDED BY PROTECTED SALTMARSHES. THE NET BENEFITS WERE ASSESSED FOR A RANGE OF MARKET CARBON PRICES AND SOCIAL COSTS OF CARBON, E.G. THE OPPORTUNITY COST OF CARBON FOR SOCIETY. APPLYING THE MODEL TO SCOTTISH SALTMARSHES WE FIND THAT THE CURRENT RANGE OF MARKET PRICES COULD PROMPT TRANSITIONS FROM HIGH TO MODERATE REGIMES IN AREAS WHERE LIVESTOCK VALUE IS LOW, HOWEVER BREAK-EVEN PRICES FOR TRANSITIONS SHOWED HIGH SPATIAL VARIABILITY DUE TO SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN LIVESTOCK VALUES. IN SOME AREAS OF THE WEST HIGHLANDS, THE BREAK-EVEN CARBON PRICE IS NEGATIVE, INDICATING THAT THE CURRENT AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL SCHEMES ARE ABLE TO MORE THAN COMPENSATE FOR THE LOST REVENUE ACCRUING TO FARMERS BY A REDUCED GRAZING DENSITY. HOWEVER, IN OTHER AREAS, SUCH AS THE OUTER HEBRIDES, THE BREAKEVEN CARBON PRICE IS POSITIVE. PRIVATE PES SCHEMES OR INCREASED PUBLIC SUBSIDIES SHOULD THEN BE PROVIDED TO GENERATE NET BENEFITS. IT IS REASONABLE TO INFER THAT A PURE CARBON MARKET MAY HAVE LIMITED SCOPE IN INCENTIVISING CONSUMERS TO BUY CARBON SERVICES, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WITH LIMITED LOCAL NUMBER OF BUYERS AND CORPORATES OF SMALL SIZE. UNDER THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, A PREMIUM CARBON MARKET OFFERING BUNDLED ECOSYSTEM SERVICES MAY HELP REDUCE GRAZING PRESSURE ACROSS A LARGER NUMBER OF SCOTTISH SALTMARSHES, THEREBY PROVIDING GLOBALLY IMPORTANT CLIMATE REGULATION SERVICES AND AT THE SAME TIME PROTECTING SENSITIVE HABITATS.","ASSESSING THE FEASIBILITY OF CARBON PAYMENTS AND PAYMENTS FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES TO REDUCE LIVESTOCK GRAZING PRESSURE ON SALTMARSHES","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT","ARTICLE","NOV 1",2018,"10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.07.060","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000445988400006"

WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT (A) PRODUCTION IN LICHEN-SHRUB HUMMOCKS IS LESS THAN IN SPHAGNUM-SHRUB HUMMOCKS; (B) THE DECAY OF LICHEN LITTER IS FASTER THAN THAT OF SPHAGNUM MOSS, SO THE MASS LITTER INPUT TO THE PEAT PROFILE IS REDUCED; AND (C) FASTER DECOMPOSITION OF THE UNDERLYING PEAT IS STIMULATED BY LICHEN LEACHATES, RESULTING IN GREATER MASS LOSS. WE FOUND THAT THICK LICHEN MATS ALTER VEGETATION COMPOSITION IN PEATLANDS, REDUCING SPHAGNUM COVER AND INHIBITING THE GROWTH OF SMALL SHRUBS. COUPLED WITH LOW LICHEN PRODUCTIVITY THAT IS CONSTRAINED BY MOISTURE CONDITIONS, PRODUCTION FOR LICHEN-SHRUB HUMMOCKS IS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER THAN FOR SPHAGNUM-SHRUB HUMMOCKS, CONFIRMING HYPOTHESIS (A). OUR DATA ALSO SUPPORT HYPOTHESIS (B), WITH CHEMICAL ANALYSES OF LICHEN MATS AND LEACHATES FROM LICHEN MATS INDICATING FASTER DECAY OF LICHENS COMPARED TO SPHAGNUM MOSS, AND THEREFORE REDUCED MASS LITTER INPUT TO THE PEAT PROFILE IN LICHEN-DOMINATED HUMMOCKS. ALTHOUGH WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST LEACHATES FROM LICHENS ENHANCE DECOMPOSITION PROCESSES IN PEATLANDS (HYPOTHESIS C), LARGER DRY BULK DENSITIES FOR PEAT UNDER LICHEN MATS INDICATE A LOSS OF STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY AND POTENTIAL COLLAPSE OF THE PEAT COLUMN.SYNTHESIS.

THE COST-EFFICIENT VERSION OF TOPMODEL AND THE SCHEME OF PEATLAND INITIATION AND DEVELOPMENT FROM THE DYPTOP MODEL ARE IMPLEMENTED AND ADJUSTED TO SIMULATE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF PEATLAND. THE MODEL IS TESTED ACROSS A RANGE OF NORTHERN PEATLAND SITES AND FOR GRIDDED SIMULATIONS OVER THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE (> 30 DEGREES N). SIMULATED NORTHERN PEATLAND AREA (3.9 MILLION KM(2)), PEAT CARBON STOCK (463 PG C), AND PEAT DEPTH ARE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH OBSERVED ESTIMATES OF PEATLAND AREA (3.4-4.0 MILLION KM2), PEAT CARBON (270-540 PG C), AND DATA COMPILATIONS OF PEAT CORE DEPTHS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT BOTH NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION (NPP) AND HETEROTROPHIC RESPIRATION (HR) OF NORTHERN PEATLANDS INCREASED OVER THE PAST CENTURY IN RESPONSE TO CO2 AND CLIMATE CHANGE.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION THE ADDITION OF ORGANIC GEO-SORBENTS EFFECTIVELY IMMOBILIZED THE PTE CONCENTRATIONS IN MINE-DEGRADED SOIL, AND INCREASED THE MAJOR NUTRIENT CONTENTS AND THEREBY REDUCED THE BIOACCUMULATION OF PTE (CR, AS, NI, CD, ZN, AND PB) IN SPINACH. CONSEQUENTLY, B2, B5, FYM2, FYM5, PTM2, AND PTM5 AMENDMENTS SIGNIFICANTLY (P<0.001) INCREASED THE BIOMASS, WHEREAS THE B1, FYM1, AND PTM1 ADDITION SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SPINACH BIOMASS AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL TREATMENT. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT ALL THE ORGANIC GEO-SORBENTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY (P<0.001) REDUCED THE AS UPTAKE IN SPINACH, WHILE B2, B5, FYM2, FYM5, AND PTM5 SIGNIFICANTLY (P<0.001) DECREASED PTE BIOACCUMULATION AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL TREATMENT.

LOCATION LAKE ATURTAUN, ROUNDSTONE BOG, IRELAND. METHODS IN A FLOATING FEN, TRANSECTS WERE SET OUT TO ANALYZE THE RELATION BETWEEN VEGETATION TYPE AND ROCK-PEAT DISTANCE AND POREWATER ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY.

BIOGEOCHEMICAL MEASUREMENTS WERE CONDUCTED IN A VERTICAL PROFILE TO DISTINGUISH ABIOTIC CONDITIONS OF DISTINCT VEGETATION TYPES. RESULTS GEOHYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS MAY DRIVE THE DISTRIBUTION OF POOR AND RICH FEN SPECIES AT A LARGER SCALE IN THE FLOATING FEN, DUE TO THE SUPPLY OF MINEROTROPHIC GROUNDWATER. INTERESTINGLY, BOTH RICH AND POOR FEN VEGETATION OCCURRED IN A MOSAIC, WHEN ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY VALUES AT 50 CM DEPTH WERE BETWEEN 300 MU S/CM AND 450 MU S/CM. ALTHOUGH ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WERE HOMOGENEOUS AT 50 CM, THEY DIFFERED MARKEDLY BETWEEN RICH AND POOR FEN VEGETATION AT 10 CM DEPTH.

TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE EVALUATED THE BIODEGRADABILITY OF FEN DOC IN A FACTORIAL DESIGN WITH AND WITHOUT ALGAL DOC IN BOTH AMBIENT (15 DEGREES C) AND ELEVATED (20 DEGREES C) WATER TEMPERATURES DURING A LABORATORY BIOASSAY. WHEN DOC SOURCES WERE EVALUATED SEPARATELY, DECOMPOSITION RATES WERE HIGHER IN TREATMENTS WITH ALGAL DOC ONLY THAN WITH FEN DOC ONLY, INDICATING THAT THE QUALITY OF THE ORGANIC MATTER INFLUENCED DEGRADABILITY. A MIXTURE OF SUBSTRATES (1/2 ALGAL DOC + 1/2 FEN DOC) EXCEEDED THE EXPECTED LEVEL OF BIODEGRADATION (I.E.

IN THE STUDY AREA, THE VANCLEVE COAL IS RELATIVELY THIN (<76 CM), LOW IN ASH YIELD (AVG. 7.0%, DRY BASIS), AND HIGH IN OVERALL TOTAL SULFUR CONTENT (AVG. 33%, DRY BASIS). THREE VERY THIN (<10 CM THICK) LEADER COALS ARE PRESENT AT TWO OF THE SIX SAMPLE LOCATIONS. THE LEADER COALS ARE HIGH IN ASH YIELD (AVG. 29.4%, DRY BASIS), AND HIGH, BUT VARIABLE, TOTAL SULFUR CONTENT (AVG. 5.0%, RANGE 1.1 TO 8.8%, DRY BASIS). PALYNOLOGICALLY, THE COAL IS DOMINATED BY LYCOSPORA (AVG. 80.4%), THE DISPERSED SPORE GENUS OF LEPIDOPHLOIOS, LEPIDODENDRON, AND PARALYCOPODITES. LYCOSPORA MICROPAPILLATA AND LYCOSPORA ORBICULA, BOTH OF WHICH WERE PRODUCED BY PARALYCOPODITES, AN ECOTONAL, COLONIZING LYCOPOD, ARE MORE PREVALENT NEAR THE BASE OF THE COAL BED. LYCOSPORA PELLUCIDA, LYCOSPORA GRANULATA (PRODUCED BY LEPIDOPHLOIOS), AND LYCOSPORA PUSILLA (PRODUCED BY LEPIDODENDRON) ARE MORE ABUNDANT IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER PORTIONS OF THE BED. SPORES AND POLLEN FROM OTHER PENNSYLVANIAN PLANT GROUPS ARE MINOR IN OCCURRENCE. BIOSTRATIGRAPHICALLY, THE COAL IS TRANSITIONAL WESTPHALIAN A/B IN AGE, CONTAINING BOTH LATE LANGSETTIAN, AND EARLY DUCKMANTIAN ELEMENTS. PETROGRAPHICALLY, THE COAL IS HIGH IN VITRINITE CONTENT (AVG. 80.5%, MMF), WITH TELOVITRINITE OCCURRING MORE COMMONLY THAN DETROVITRINITE AND GELOVITRINITE (AVG. TV / DV + GV = 33). LIPTINITE (AVG. 9.4%, MMF) AND INERTINITE (10.2%, MMF) OCCUR IN MINOR AMOUNTS BY COMPARISON. THE AVERAGE RANDOM VITRINITE REFLECTANCE OF THE VANCLEVE COAL IS 0.54%, AND THE AVERAGE CALCULATED MAXIMUM VITRINITE REFLECTANCE IS 0.58%, INDICATING THE VANCLEVE COAL TO BE HIGH VOLATILE C/B BITUMINOUS IN RANK, IN THE STUDY AREA. LOW ASH YIELDS ARE OFTEN CONSIDERED INDICATIVE, AT LEAST IN PART, OF OMBROTROPHIC (RAISED) MIRE ORIGINS IN PENNSYLVANIAN COAL BEDS. HOWEVER, THE DOMINANCE OF LYCOSPORA, VITRINITE MACERALS, AND HIGH SULFUR CONTENTS INDICATES THAT THE VANCLEVE COAL BED IS MOST LIKELY FORMED FROM A PLANAR, RHEOTHROPHIC MIRE, WITH A CONSISTENTLY HIGH WATER TABLE. LOW ASH YIELDS INDICATE THAT THE PALEOMIRE WAS NOT SUBJECTED TO ANY LARGE INFLUXES OF SEDIMENT DURING PEAT ACCUMULATION FROM EXTRA-MIRE SOURCES.

A 5-YEAR NATIVE PLANT REVEGETATION OF POLLUTED SOIL AND RELATIVE POST-WASHING SLUDGES FROM A STEEL PLANT WAS ACHIEVED IN SITU AND EX SITU IN POT AND IN THE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OF PEAT AS ORGANIC AMENDMENT. DURING THE EXPERIMENT, THE VEGETATION GROWTH WAS MONITORED (ADAMO ET AL. IN INT J ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL 12(6):1811-1824, 2015). BEFORE AND AFTER PLANT GROWTH, THE SUBSTRATES WERE STUDIED FOR PH, ORGANIC CARBON, AND CARBONATE CONTENTS. LEAD, ZN, AND OTHER METAL MOBILITY AND LEACHABILITY WERE INVESTIGATED BY WATER EXTRACTION. THE METAL BIOAVAILABILITY WAS ESTIMATED BY DIETHYLENETRIAMINEPENTAACETIC ACID (DTPA) EXTRACTION AT PH 7.3. SEQUENTIAL EXTRACTIONS (BCR PROCEDURE) WERE USED TO FRACTIONATE PB AND ZN IN SOIL MAIN GEOCHEMICAL FORMS. PLANT ABILITY TO UPTAKE METALS WAS EVALUATED ON THE THREE MOST REPRESENTATIVE SPECIES: BITUMINARIA BITUMINOSA, DAUCUS CAROTA, AND DACTYLIS GLOMERATA. AFTER 5 YEARS OF REVEGETATION WITH NATIVE PLANTS, THE SUBSTRATE PH AND ORGANIC CARBON CONTENT WERE RESPECTIVELY DECREASED AND INCREASED BY PLANT GROWTH, WITH CHANGES MASKED BY PEAT TREATMENTS. ALTHOUGH METAL POLLUTANTS IN BOTH SUBSTRATES WERE CHARACTERIZED BY LOW WATER SOLUBILITY AND DTPA AVAILABILITY, AFTER PLANT GROWTH, AN INCREASE OF RHIZOSPHERIC ZN, CU, FE, AND MN SOLUBILITY IN H2O WAS DETECTED. ACCORDING TO METAL SPECIATION, PB AND ZN WERE LARGELY OCCLUDED IN EASILY REDUCIBLE MANGANESE/IRON OXIDES AND TRAPPED IN THE MINERAL STRUCTURE OF SILICATES, WITH NO VISIBLE CHANGES OF DISTRIBUTION AFTER PLANTS. WATER EXTRACTION ALWAYS UNDERESTIMATED PLANT UPTAKE, WHEREAS DTPA AND SEQUENTIAL EXTRACTIONS BETTER PREDICTED PB AND ZN UPTAKE. DESPITE THE ORIGINAL EXTREMELY LOW MOBILITY AND BIOAVAILABILITY OF METAL POLLUTANTS IN BOTH SOIL AND POST-WASHING SLUDGES, THE ACIDIFICATION AND INCREASE OF ORGANIC CARBON CONTENT INDUCED BY PEAT AMENDMENTS AND PLANT GROWTH ENHANCE THE SOLUBILITY IN WATER OF METAL-CONTAINING COMPOUNDS. THEREFORE, ATTENTION MUST BE PAID TO THESE EFFECTS IN THE LONG PERIOD.

ALTHOUGH THERE WAS VERY GOOD AGREEMENT BETWEEN MONITORED AND MODELED WTD, TA-RECONSTRUCTED WATER TABLE WAS CONSISTENTLY DEEPER.

IN A SECOND STUDY, PEAT CHEMISTRY AND SOIL/AIR MICROCLIMATE WERE EVALUATED IN PLANTATIONS ESTABLISHED ON SHALLOW RESIDUAL PEAT (A 21-YEAR-OLD LARIX LARICINA PLANTATION AND AN 18-YEAR-OLD PICEA MARIANA PLANTATION) AND COMPARED TO ADJACENT UNRESTORED SHALLOW BARE-PEAT FIELDS.

THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT AFFORESTATION IS AN APPROPRIATE APPROACH TO START AN ECOLOGICAL RECOVERY.

POTENTIAL LIMITATION OF THESE PLANTS TO AREAS WITH LOW SULFATE WAS ANALYZED WITH A SPATIAL MATCH-UP OF TWO LARGE DATABASES. THE PEAT POLDERS ARE GENERALLY USED FOR DAIRY FARMING OR NATURE CONSERVATION, AND HAVE CONSIDERABLE AREAS OF SHALLOW SURFACE WATER (MEAN 16%, RANGE 6-43%). AS A CONSEQUENCE OF CONTINUOUS DRAINAGE, THE PEAT IN THESE POLDERS MINERALIZES CAUSING SUBSIDENCE RATES GENERALLY RANGING BETWEEN 2 AND 10 MM Y(-1). TOGETHER WITH PYRITE OXIDATION, THIS PEAT MINERALIZATION THE MOST IMPORTANT INTERNAL SOURCE OF SULFATE, PROVIDING AN ESTIMATED 96 KG SO4 HA(-1) MM(-1) SUBSIDENCE EXTERNAL SOURCES ARE PRECIPITATION AND WATER SUPPLIED DURING SUMMER TO COMPENSATE FOR WATER SHORTAGE, BUT THESE WERE FOUND TO BE MINOR COMPARED TO INTERNAL RELEASE. THE MOST IMPORTANT OUTPUT FLUX IS DISCHARGE OF EXCESS SURFACE WATER DURING AUTUMN AND WINTER. IF ONLY EXTERNAL FLUXES IN AND OUT OF A POLDER ARE EVALUATED, INPUTS AVERAGE 37 +/- 9 AND EXPORTS 169 +/- 17 KG S HA(-1) Y(-1). DURING SUMMER, WHEN EVAPOTRANSPIRATION EXCEEDS RAINFALL, SULFATE ACCUMULATES IN THE UNSATURATED ZONE, TO BE FLUSHED AWAY AND DRAINED OFF DURING THE WET AUTUMN AND WINTER. IN SOME POLDERS, UPWARD SEEPAGE FROM EARLY HOLOCENE, BRACKISH SEDIMENTS CAN BE A SOURCE OF SULFATE. PEAT POLDERS EXPORT SULFATE TO THE REGIONAL WATER SYSTEM AND THE SEA DURING WINTER DRAINAGE. THE AVAILABLE SULFATE PROBABLY ONLY PLAYS A MINOR ROLE IN THE OXIDATION OF PEAT: WE ESTIMATE THAT THIS IS LESS THAN 10% WHEREAS AEROBIC MINERALIZATION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. MOST SURFACE WATERS IN THESE POLDERS HAVE HIGH SULFATE CONCENTRATIONS, WHICH GENERALLY DECLINE DURING THE GROWING SEASON WHEN AQUATIC SEDIMENTS ARE A SINK. IN THE SEDIMENT, THIS SULFUR IS REDUCED AND BINDS IRON MORE STRONGLY THAN PHOSPHORUS, WHICH CAN BE RELEASED TO THE OVERLYING WATER AND POTENTIALLY FUELS EUTROPHICATION.

THE OBSERVED INCREASE OF VASCULAR PLANTS IN PEATLANDS COULD ALTER THE DECOMPOSITION RATE AND THE CARBON (C) CYCLE THROUGH A LITTER MIXING EFFECT, WHICH IS STILL POORLY STUDIED. HERE, WE EXAMINE THE LITTER MIXING EFFECT OF A PEAT MOSS (SPHAGNUM FALLAX) AND TWO VASCULAR PLANTS (PINUS UNCINATA AND ERIOPHORUM VAGINATUM) IN THE FIELD AND LABORATORY-BASED EXPERIMENT. DURING THE LABORATORY INCUBATION, MASS LOSS, CO2 PRODUCTION, AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON CONCENTRATION WERE PERIODICALLY MONITORED DURING 51 DAYS. THE COLLECTED DATA WERE THEN PROCESSED IN A C DYNAMICS MODEL. THE CALCULATED ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY WAS CORRELATED TO THE MEASURED BETA-GLUCOSIDASE ACTIVITY IN THE LITTER. IN THE FIELD EXPERIMENT, MASS LOSS AND CO2 PRODUCTION FROM LITTER BAGS WERE ANNUALLY MEASURED FOR 3 YEARS. BOTH LABORATORY AND FIELD EXPERIMENTS CLEARLY SHOW THAT THE LITTER MIXTURE, I.E., SPHAGNUM-PINUS-ERIOPHORUM, HAD A SYNERGISTIC EFFECT ON DECOMPOSITION BY ENHANCING THE MASS LOSS. SUCH ENHANCED MASS LOSS INCREASED THE WATER EXTRACTABLE C AND CO2 PRODUCTION IN THE LITTER MIXTURE DURING THE LABORATORY EXPERIMENT. THE SYNERGISTIC EFFECT WAS MAINLY CONTROLLED BY THE SPHAGNUM-ERIOPHORUM MIXTURE THAT SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED BOTH MASS LOSS AND CO2 PRODUCTION.

RESULTS SHOWED THAT DESORPTION OF AGED PHENANTHRENE FROM SOILS WAS PREDOMINANTLY DEPENDENT ON SOIL ORGANIC CARBON CONTENT. THE PRESENCE OF DOC AND OXALATE RESULTED IN HIGHER DESORPTION OF PHENANTHRENE COMPARED TO WATER ALONE, AND THE EFFECTS WERE POSITIVELY RELATED TO SOIL ORGANIC CARBON CONTENT AND DOC/OXALATE CONCENTRATION.

THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE ADSORPTION AND DESORPTION BEHAVIORS OF N2O ON DIFFERENT RANK COALS FROM PEAT TO ANTHRACITE. THE POTENTIAL ADSORPTION MECHANISM IS ALSO ELUCIDATED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SIPS MODEL CAN WELL DESCRIBE THE EQUILIBRIUM RELATIONSHIP OF N2O ADSORPTION ON COALS. THE FITTING RESULTS DERIVED FROM THE SIPS MODEL INDICATE THAT THE ADSORPTION AFFINITY OF N2O ON COALS DECREASES WITH THE INCREASING COAL RANK, WHILE THE HETEROGENEITY OF THE ADSORPTION SYSTEM TENDS TO BE STRONGER WITH THE DECREASING COAL RANK. THE MICROPORE SURFACE AREA OF COALS GREATLY DETERMINES THE MAXIMUM ADSORPTION CAPACITY OF N2O DERIVED FROM THE SIPS MODEL. THE KINETICS PROCESS OF N2O ADSORPTION ON COALS FOLLOWS THE SIMPLIFIED BIDISPERSE MODEL, AND IT IS CONTROLLED BY THE MICROPORE DIFFUSION. THE APPARENT DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT IN MICROPORES MAINLY DEPENDS UPON MICROPORE SURFACE AREA OF COALS. THE ADSORPTION AND DESORPTION PROCESS OF N2O ON THE HIGH-RANK FUMIN (FM) COAL (R-O,R-MAX = 2.59%) IS A COMPLETELY REVERSIBLE AND PHYSICAL ADSORPTION PROCESS. IN CONTRAST, THE ADSORPTION AND DESORPTION HYSTERESIS OF N2O ON COALS BECOMES MORE SIGNIFICANT WITH THE COAL RANK DECREASING FROM 0.83 TO 0.23%, INDICATING THAT THE CHEMICAL ADSORPTION OF N2O EXISTS FOR THE LOW-RANK COALS. THE X-RAY PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY CHARACTERIZATION FURTHER REVEALS THAT THE OXYGENIC AND NITRIC SPECIATION COMPOSITIONS OF THE HIGH-RANK FM COAL AFTER N2O ADSORPTION REMAIN UNCHANGED. HOWEVER, THE OXYGENIC FUNCTIONAL GROUPS IN THE LOW-RANK COALS ACT AS THE MAIN ACTIVE SITES FOR THE CHEMICAL ADSORPTION OF N2O. INTERACTION WITH N2O ONLY INCREASES THE TOTAL NITROGEN CONTENT OF THE THREE LOW-RANK COALS BUT ALSO CHANGES THEIR NITRIC SPECIATION COMPOSITIONS, WHICH ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THE INCREASING CONTENT OF PYRIDINE N AND OXIDE N AND THE DECREASING CONTENT OF PYRROLE/PYRIDONE N.

THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF MINERAL MATTER CONTENT ON THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY (LAMBDA) IN PARTIALLY FROZEN AND UNFROZEN PEAT SAMPLES. EFFECT OF CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE FROM -3 DEGREES C TO - 10 DEGREES C ON THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY WAS ALSO ESTIMATED. THREE EXISTING MODELS FOR ESTIMATING THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF ORGANIC SOILS WERE ASSESSED FOR THEIR SUITABILITY FOR CULTIVATED DRAINED PEAT SOILS. THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF PEAT SAMPLES WITH THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF MINERAL MATTER CONTENT WAS DETERMINED, USING THE SINGLE PROBE METHOD, IN THE SATURATED STATE AND WHEN SUBJECTED TO AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT MATRIC POTENTIALS AT FIVE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES ( + 10 DEGREES C, + 1 DEGREES C, - 3 DEGREES C, - 5 DEGREES C AND -10 DEGREES C). THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT X VALUES DIFFERED BETWEEN PEAT SOILS DEPENDING ON MINERAL MATTER CONTENT, ICE CONTENT AND MOISTURE CONTENT. THE SAMPLES WITH THE HIGHEST MINERAL MATTER CONTENT AND BULK DENSITY HAD HIGHER THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY AT POSITIVE TEMPERATURES AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, AT FREEZING TEMPERATURES, WHEN VOLUMETRIC WATER CONTENT AND VOLUME OF WATER-FREE PORES WAS SIMILAR.

THE ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN CHEMICAL AND MINERAL COMPOSITION OF PEAT AND SOILS IS THE IMPORTANT STAGE OF SEARCHES OFMINERALS, DEVELOPMENT OF CORRESPONDING METHODOLOGY, AND METHODOLOGY OF ECOLOGICAL MONITORING AS WELL. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH IS TO REVEAL THE CHANGES IN CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF PEAT AND SOIL ACID EXTRACTS IN EAST PART OF THE VASYUGAN MIRE. METHODS: LANDSCAPE-GEOCHEMICAL AND STATISTICAL METHODS, METHODS OF DEFINITION OF CHEMICAL AND MINERAL COMPOSITION OF PEAT AND SOILS, IMITATING MATHEMATICAL MODELLING. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. ACCORDING TO APPROBATION OF PEATS AND MINERAL SOILS IN MARCH 2017 AND 2018 IN EAST PART OF THE VASYUGAN MIRE (WESTERN SIBERIA, THE OB RIVER BASIN, THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION) THE AUTHORS HAVE ANALYZED: CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF ACID EXTRACTS FROM PEATS AND SOILS USING 1CP MS; COMPOSITION OF MINERAL INCLUSIONS IN PEAT AND SOILS USING THE METHOD OF SCANNING ELECTRONIC MICROSCOPY AND XRD-ANALYSIS. CONCENTRATION OF 73 CHEMICAL ELEMENTS WAS DETERMINED AND THREE GROUPS OF ELEMENTS WERE ALLOCATED: 1) WITH RATHER STEADY INCREASE FROM A SURFACE TO BOTTOM SOILS AND/OR A STRONGLY PRONOUNCED MAXIMUM IN BOTTOM SOILS; 2) WITH WELL EXPRESSED MAXIMA IN THE TOP AND BOTTOM PARTS OF PEAT DEPOSITS; 3) WITH OTHER TYPES OF DISTRIBUTION. THE MAJOR FACTORS OF SPATIAL CHANGES IN CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF PEAT AND SOILS ARE MAINLY NATURAL BIOGEOCHETNICAL CONDITIONS, WATER EXCHANGE INTENSITY, RATIO OF THE ATMOSPHERIC AND GROUND WATER AND MINERAL FEED WHICH DETERMINE THE COMMON AVAILABILITY OF WATER AND NUTRIENTS FOR BOG VEGETATION, REMOVAL OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES FOR THIS VEGETATION.","CHANGES IN CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF ACID EXTRACTS ON DEPTH OF PEAT DEPOSIT OF THE VASYUGAN MIRE ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS (WESTERN SIBERIA)","BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING","ARTICLE",NA,2018,NA,"ENGINEERING, GEOLOGICAL","WOS:000445748100010"

HOWEVER, IN ORGANICALLY-DOMINATED UPLAND CATCHMENTS WITH A HIGH SEDIMENT LOAD, ERODED PARTICULATE ORGANICS MAY ALSO BE FLUVIALLY DEPOSITED WITH POTENTIAL FOR STORAGE AND/OR OXIDATION. UNDERSTANDING THE REDISTRIBUTION OF TERRESTRIAL CARBON LATERALLY, BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF RIVER CHANNELS IS IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY IN ERODING PEATLAND SYSTEMS WHERE FLUVIAL PARTICULATE ORGANIC CARBON EXPORTS ARE OFTEN ASSUMED TO BE OXIDISED. FLOODPLAINS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE BOTH CARBON CYCLING HOTSPOTS AND AREAS OF SEQUESTRATION.

THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE FORMATION OF HIGHLY ORGANIC FLOODPLAINS DOWNSTREAM OF HEAVILY ERODED PEATLANDS IN THE PEAK DISTRICT, UK.

IN THE EXPERIMENT, WE COMPARED YIELD, NUTRIENT UPTAKE, PENETRATION RESISTANCE AND LOSS OF ORGANIC MATTER MEASURED AS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS (CO2, N2O AND CH4). YIELD OF TIMOTHY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT OF REED CANARY GRASS AND TALL FESCUE IN 2016, AND LOWER THAN THAT OF REED CANARY GRASS IN 2017. YIELD LEVEL INCREASED OVER TIME, WITH TOTAL DRY MATTER YIELD IN 2017 OF 11.7 MG HA(-1) YR(-1) FOR TIMOTHY, 13.5 MG HA(-1) YR(-1) FOR TALL FESCUE AND 14.3 MG HA(-1) YR(-1) FOR REED CANARY GRASS.

IN THIS PAPER WE HAVE EVALUATED THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT LAND USES AS SOURCES OF DOC BY COMBINING THREE DAMSELS OBTAINED FROM THE EXE CATCHMENT, UK. THE FIRST DATASET COMPRISES A WEEKLY MONITORING RECORD AT THREE SITES FOR SIX YEARS, THE SECOND, A MONTHLY MONITORING RECORD OF 25 SITES IN THE SAME CATCHMENT FOR ONE YEAR, AND THE THIRD, AN ASSESSMENT OF DOC EXPORT FROM LITTER AND SOIL CARBON STOCKS.

MODEL EXPERIMENTS UNDER WELL CONTROLLED EXTERNAL CONDITIONS ARE A GOOD TOOL TO DETERMINE THE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH FACTOR TO THE DECOMPOSITION PROCESS. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO QUANTIFY THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE (T) AND MOISTURE (W) OF PEAT ON THE DECOMPOSITION RATE OF THE MAIN PEAT-FORMING PLANT RESIDUES OF THE OLIGOTROPHIC WETLAND IN THE SOUTHERN TAIGA SUBZONE OF WESTERN SIBERIA. IN A 3-MONTH INCUBATION EXPERIMENT, WE STUDIED THE INITIAL STAGES OF DECOMPOSITION OF 4 TYPES OF PLANT SUBSTRATES AT VARIOUS TEMPERATURES (T = 2, 12, 22 DEGREES C) AND CONTRASTING MOISTURE LEVELS CORRESPONDING TO 30, 60 AND 90% OF THEIR WATER HOLDING CAPACITY (WHC). WE COLLECTED PLANT RESIDUES OF SPHAGNUM FUSCUM KLINGGR., CHAMAEDAPHNE CALYCULATA MOENCH., AND ERIOPHORUM VAGINATUM L. IN THE BAKCHARSKOE OLIGOTROPHIC BOG (BAKCHARSKY DISTRICT, TOMSK REGION, 56 DEGREES 58'N, 82 DEGREES 36'E) IN SEPTEMBER 2017. BESIDES THE INDIVIDUAL TYPES OF PLANT RESIDUES, A MIXED SAMPLE OF S. FUSCUM (60%) AND CH. CALYCULATA (40%) WAS ALSO STUDIED. WE DETERMINED THE BASIC PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS IN THE ORIGINAL PLANT SUBSTRATES: PH VALUE IN WATER AND SALT EXTRACTS (1M KC1) (LITTER : SOLUTION = 1:25), WHC, HYGROSCOPIC MOISTURE, ASH CONTENT, TOTAL CARBON (C) AND NITROGEN (N) CONTENT, C TO N RATIO, AND SOME ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (ALCOHOL-SOLUBLE COMPOUNDS, CELLULOSE, LIGNIN AND LIGNIN-LIKE SUBSTANCES) BY THE GRAVIMETRIC METHOD (SEE TABLE 1-2). LIGNIN AND BIOGENETICALLY RELATED LIGNANS AND FLAVONOIDS WERE DETERMINED AFTER REMOVAL OF BITUMINOUS SUBSTANCES AND TREATMENT WITH 72 % SULFURIC ACID. CELLULOSE WAS EXTRACTED USING A MIXTURE OF CONCENTRATED NITRIC ACID AND ETHANOL. FOR THE EXPERIMENT, WE PLACED PLANT RESIDUES (1-3 G OF AIR-DRY MASS) IN 110-ML GLASS BOTTLES AND MOISTENED TO 30, 60 AND 90% OF THEIR WHC WITH BOG WATER, WHICH CONTAINED NATIVE MICROFLORA. THE BOTTLES WITH MOISTENED PLANT RESIDUES STAYED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE FOR 7 DAYS (PRE-INCUBATION PERIOD) AND, THEN, WERE PLACED IN THERMOSTATS FOR A 3-MONTH INCUBATION AT 2, 12, AND 22 DEGREES C. DURING THE EXPERIMENT, THE MOISTURE CONTENT OF PLANT MATERIAL WAS MAINTAINED AT A CONSTANT LEVEL BY ADDING BOG WATER. THE EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED IN 3 REPLICATES. CO2 EMISSION RATE (OR DECOMPOSITION RATE, DECR) OF THE MAIN PEAT-FORMING PLANT RESIDUES WAS MEASURED USING LI-820 (USA) INFRARED GAS ANALYZER 3-5 TIMES PER WEEK FOR THE 1ST MONTH OF THE EXPERIMENT AND 2 TIMES PER WEEK OVER THE NEXT 2 MONTHS. THE DECOMPOSITION CONSTANT (K) OF PLANT RESIDUES WAS CALCULATED BASED ON THE CURVES OF CUMULATIVE C(CO2) LOSSES OVER THE ENTIRE EXPERIMENT USING AN EXPONENTIAL REGRESSION MODEL. DECR (MU G C/G SAMPLE/HOUR) WAS CALCULATED ACCORDING TO KURGANOVA I ET AL. (2018), KURGANOVA I ET AL. (2012). THE IMPACT OF THE TEMPERATURE FACTOR WAS ESTIMATED USING Q(10) TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT ACCORDING TO KURGANOVA I ET AL (2012), WHICH WAS DETERMINED FOR TWO TEMPERATURE INTERVALS (2-12 DEGREES C AND 12-22 DEGREES C). WE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE DYNAMICS AND INTENSITY OF C (CO2) RELEASE DURING THE EXPERIMENT WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY ALL THREE FACTORS: TEMPERATURE, MOISTURE CONTENT, AND TYPE OF PLANT RESIDUES. IN THE INITIAL STAGES OF DECOMPOSITION, WE OBSERVED AN ENHANCED RELEASE OF C (CO2) FOR ALL PLANT SAMPLES CAUSED BY A SURGE IN THE ACTIVITY OF DESTRUCTOR MICROORGANISMS AND THE PRESENCE OF READILY AVAILABLE COMPOUNDS IN THE LITTER COMPOSITION. AN INCREASE IN THE DECOMPOSITION RATE AT 22 DEGREES C WAS RECORDED DURING THE FIRST 1-2 DAYS OF INCUBATION AND AT 2 DEGREES C AFTER 1-2 WEEKS OF EXPERIMENT. AT THE SAME TIME, THE DECREASE IN THE DECOMPOSITION ACTIVITY OF PLANT RESIDUES AT 2 DEGREES C WAS MUCH SLOWER THAN AT 22 DEGREES C (SEE FIG. 1-3). THE TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT Q(10) FOR DECR DEPENDED ON THE TYPE OF PLANT RESIDUE AND ITS MOISTURE AND VARIED FROM 0.97 TO 1.53 IN THE LOW TEMPERATURE RANGE (2-12 DEGREES C) AND FROM 1.05 TO 2.18 IN THE TEMPERATURE RANGE OF 12-22 DEGREES C (SEE FIG. 6). THE HIGHEST TOTAL C (CO2) LOSSES THROUGHOUT THE 3 MONTHS OF THE EXPERIMENT (C-CUM) WERE OBSERVED FOR CH. CALYCULATA AND E. VAGINATUM. C-CUM VALUE VARIED FROM 67 TO 93 MG C/G AT 22 DEGREES C AND DECREASED TO 29-46 MG C/G AT 2 DEGREES C (SEE FIG. 4, D-F). DEPENDING ON TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE, S. FUSCUM LOST ONLY 3-5% OF THE INITIAL AMOUNT OF C OVER THE 3 MONTHS OF THE EXPERIMENT. THE MIXED SAMPLE LOST 6-11% OF THE INITIAL C CONTENT WHEREAS THE C(CO2) LOSSES FROM CH. CALYCULATA AND E. VAGINATUM VARIED FROM 6 TO 18% (SEE FIG. 4, D-F). BASED ON THE RESULT OF 3-WAY ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA), WE REVEALED THAT ALL THE FACTORS STUDIED (TYPE OF PLANT SUBSTRATE, TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE CONTENT) SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED THE VARIABILITY OF C-CUM VALUE FOR 3 MONTHS OF THE EXPERIMENT. THE TYPE OF SUBSTRATE IS THE MAIN FACTOR WHICH AFFECTED THE TOTAL C(CO2), EXPLAINING 61% OF THE TOTAL VARIANCE OF C-CUM (SEE TABLE 3). TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY ACCOUNTED FOR 31 AND 2% OF THE VARIANCE EXPLAINED, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2-WAY ANOVA WAS CARRIED OUT INDIVIDUALLY FOR EACH PLANT SUBSTRATE AND SHOWED THAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS THE MAIN FACTOR THAT AFFECTED THE TOTAL C(CO2) LOSS FROM THE STUDIED PLANT SUBSTRATES EXPLAINING 75-90% OF THE C-CUM DISPERSION (SEE TABLE 4). THE LOWEST VALUES OF THE DECOMPOSITION CONSTANT (K = 0.0003-0.0004 DAY(-1)) WERE ATTRIBUTED TO THE S. FUSCUM AT 12 AND 2 DEGREES C. DECOMPOSITION CONSTANTS FOR E. VAGINATUM AND CH. CALYCULATA WERE THE HIGHEST (K> 0.001 DAY(-1)) AT ALL STUDIED TEMPERATURES AMONG ALL TYPES OF PLANT SUBSTRATES (SEE FIG. 5). WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT DUE TO THE SLOW DECOMPOSITION RATE, S.

SINCE THESE ECOSYSTEMS STORE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF SOIL ORGANIC CARBON, WHICH CAN BE MINERALIZED TO CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) AND METHANE (CH4), RISING TEMPERATURES MAY CAUSE INCREASING GREENHOUSE GAS FLUXES TO THE ATMOSPHERE. TO UNDERSTAND HOW NET THE ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE (NEE) OF CO2 WILL RESPOND TO CHANGING CLIMATIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES OF THE PROCESSES CONTRIBUTING TO NEE. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY AIMED TO PARTITION NEE AT THE SOIL-PLANT-ATMOSPHERE INTERFACE IN AN ARCTIC TUNDRA ECOSYSTEM AND TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS OF THESE FLUXES. NEE WAS PARTITIONED INTO GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY (GPP) AND ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION (R-ECO) AND FURTHER INTO AUTOTROPHIC (R-A) AND HETEROTROPHIC RESPIRATION (R-H). THE STUDY EXAMINED CO2 FLUX DATA COLLECTED DURING THE GROWING SEASON IN 2015 USING CLOSED-CHAMBER MEASUREMENTS IN A POLYGONAL TUNDRA LANDSCAPE IN THE LENA RIVER DELTA, NORTHEASTERN SIBERIA. TO CAPTURE THE INFLUENCE OF SOIL HYDROLOGY ON CO2 FLUXES, MEASUREMENTS WERE CONDUCTED AT A WATER-SATURATED POLYGON CENTER AND A WELL-DRAINED POLYGON RIM. THESE CHAMBER-MEASURED FLUXES WERE USED TO MODEL NEE, GPP, R-ECO, R-H, R-A, AND NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION (NPP) AT THE PEDON SCALE (1-10 M) AND TO DETERMINE CUMULATIVE GROWING SEASON FLUXES. HERE, THE RESPONSE OF IN SITU MEASURED R-A AND R-H FLUXES FROM PERMAFROST-AFFECTED SOILS OF THE POLYGONAL TUNDRA TO HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN EXAMINED. ALTHOUGH CHANGES IN THE WATER TABLE DEPTH AT THE POLYGON CENTER SITES DID NOT AFFECT CO2 FLUXES FROM R-H, RISING WATER TABLES WERE LINKED TO REDUCED CO2 FLUXES FROM R-A. FURTHERMORE, THIS WORK FOUND THE POLYGONAL TUNDRA IN THE LENA RIVER DELTA TO BE A NET SINK FOR ATMOSPHERIC CO2 DURING THE GROWING SEASON. THE NEE AT THE WET, DEPRESSED POLYGON CENTER WAS MORE THAN TWICE THAT AT THE DRIER POLYGON RIM. THESE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO SITES WERE CAUSED BY HIGHER GPP FLUXES DUE TO A HIGHER VASCULAR PLANT DENSITY AND LOWER R-ECO FLUXES DUE TO OXYGEN LIMITATION UNDER WATER-SATURATED CONDITIONS AT THE POLYGON CENTER IN COMPARISON TO THE RIM.

PRIOR EXPECTATIONS, BASED ON THE IPCC DEFAULT EMISSION FACTOR, WERE THAT 1% OF THE ADDED NITROGEN WOULD BE EMITTED AS N2O. IN THE PLOTS TREATED WITH NH4+ AND NO3- SOLUTION, NO RESPONSE WAS SEEN, AND THERE WAS A TENDENCY FOR N2O FLUXES TO BE REDUCED BY ADDITIONAL NITROGEN, THOUGH THIS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT. AREAS SUBJECTED TO HIGH NH3 EMITTED MORE N2O THAN EXPECTED, UP TO 8.5% OF THE ADDED NITROGEN. DIFFERENCES IN THE RESPONSE ARE RELATED TO THE IMPACT OF THE NITROGEN TREATMENTS ON THE VEGETATION.

THE MODEL TREATS IN A CONSISTENT MANNER THE INTERACTION BETWEEN ATMOSPHERE, TERRESTRIAL VEGETATION AND SOIL THROUGH THE FLUXES OF ENERGY, WATER AND CARBON. ENERGY, WATER AND CARBON ARE CONSERVED. PALADYN EXPLICITLY TREATS PERMAFROST, BOTH IN PHYSICAL PROCESSES AND AS AN IMPORTANT CARBON POOL. IT DISTINGUISHES NINE SURFACE TYPES: FIVE DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES, BARE SOIL, LAND ICE, LAKE AND OCEAN SHELF. INCLUDING THE OCEAN SHELF ALLOWS THE TREATMENT OF CONTINUOUS CHANGES IN SEA LEVEL AND SHELF AREA ASSOCIATED WITH GLACIAL CYCLES. OVER EACH SURFACE TYPE, THE MODEL SOLVES THE SURFACE ENERGY BALANCE AND COMPUTES THE FLUXES OF SENSIBLE, LATENT AND GROUND HEAT AND UPWARD SHORTWAVE AND LONGWAVE RADIATION. THE MODEL INCLUDES A SINGLE SNOW LAYER. VEGETATION AND BARE SOIL SHARE A SINGLE SOIL COLUMN. THE SOIL IS VERTICALLY DISCRETIZED INTO FIVE LAYERS WHERE PROGNOSTIC EQUATIONS FOR TEMPERATURE, WATER AND CARBON ARE CONSISTENTLY SOLVED. PHASE CHANGES OF WATER IN THE SOIL ARE EXPLICITLY CONSIDERED. A SURFACE HYDROLOGY MODULE COMPUTES PRECIPITATION INTERCEPTION BY VEGETATION, SURFACE RUNOFF AND SOIL INFILTRATION. THE SOIL WATER EQUATION IS BASED ON DARCY'S LAW. GIVEN SOIL WATER CONTENT, THE WETLAND FRACTION IS COMPUTED BASED ON A TOPOGRAPHIC INDEX. THE TEMPERATURE PROFILE IS ALSO COMPUTED IN THE UPPER PART OF ICE SHEETS AND IN THE OCEAN SHELF SOIL. PHOTOSYNTHESIS IS COMPUTED USING A LIGHT USE EFFICIENCY MODEL. CARBON ASSIMILATION BY VEGETATION IS COUPLED TO THE TRANSPIRATION OF WATER THROUGH STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE. PALADYN INCLUDES A DYNAMIC VEGETATION MODULE WITH FIVE PLANT FUNCTIONAL TYPES COMPETING FOR THE GRID CELL SHARE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY. PALADYN DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN MINERAL SOIL CARBON, PEAT CARBON, BURIED CARBON AND SHELF CARBON. EACH SOIL CARBON TYPE HAS ITS OWN SOIL CARBON POOLS GENERALLY REPRESENTED BY A LITTER, A FAST AND A SLOW CARBON POOL IN EACH SOIL LAYER. CARBON CAN BE REDISTRIBUTED BETWEEN THE LAYERS BY VERTICAL DIFFUSION AND ADVECTION. FOR THE VEGETATED MACRO SURFACE TYPE, DECOMPOSITION IS A FUNCTION OF SOIL TEMPERATURE AND SOIL MOISTURE. CARBON IN PERMANENTLY FROZEN LAYERS IS ASSIGNED A LONG TURNOVER TIME WHICH EFFECTIVELY LOCKS CARBON IN PERMAFROST. CARBON BURIED BELOW ICE SHEETS AND ON FLOODED OCEAN SHELVES IS TREATED DIFFERENTLY. THE MODEL ALSO INCLUDES A DYNAMIC PEAT MODULE. PALADYN INCLUDES CARBON ISOTOPES C-13 AND C-14, WHICH ARE TRACKED THROUGH ALL CARBON POOLS. ISOTOPIC DISCRIMINATION IS MODELLED ONLY DURING PHOTOSYNTHESIS. A SIMPLE METHANE MODULE IS IMPLEMENTED TO REPRESENT METHANE EMISSIONS FROM ANAEROBIC CARBON DECOMPOSITION IN WETLANDS (INCLUDING PEATLANDS) AND FLOODED OCEAN SHELF.

WE TESTED ENROOT'S ACCURACY AND PRECISION FOR MEASURING FINE ROOT LENGTH AND DIAMETER, AND IT YIELDED LIN'S CONCORDANCE CORRELATION COEFFICIENT VALUES OF 0.95 FOR ROOT DIAMETER AND 0.92 FOR LENGTH. AS A PROOF OF CONCEPT, WE TESTED ENROOT IN A MESOCOSM STUDY, AND IN THE FIELD IN A TROPICAL MANGROVE. ENROOT PROVED ITS CAPACITY TO CAPTURE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ROOTS OF A LEGUME (MEDICAGO SATIVA) AND A MANGROVE SPECIES (SEEDLINGS OF RHIZOPHORA MANGLE) IN LABORATORY MESOCOSMS. ENROOT'S FIELD INSTALLATION WAS POSSIBLE IN THE ROOT-DENSE TROPICAL MANGROVE BECAUSE ITS NARROW DIAMETER ALLOWED IT TO BE INSTALLED BETWEEN LARGER ROOTS AND BECAUSE IT IS FULLY WATERPROOF.

BOTH BIOCHAR MIXES INCREASED MEDIA PH, AIR FILLED POROSITY, BULK DENSITY AND NUTRIENT CONTENT RELATIVE TO BO. THE BO HAD THE HIGHEST CATION EXCHANGE CAPACITY AND ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY. THE UB-BASED MIXES, B20 AND B60, HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON SILVERBEET BIOMASS AFTER 11 WEEKS OF GROWTH BUT HAD HIGHER N USE EFFICIENCY AND P AVAILABILITY THAN BO. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT UB CAN COMPLETELY REPLACE SPHAGNUM PEAT FROM GROWING MEDIA AND CAN BE USED AT THE RATE OF 60% ON VOLUME BASIS WHILE IMPROVING N AND P AVAILABILITY. USING A HIGHER RATE OF BIOCHAR IN GROWING MEDIA HAS THE ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGE OF SEQUESTERING MORE CARBON AND REDUCING URBAN WASTE STREAMS AND LANDFILL COSTS.","URBAN BIOCHAR IMPROVES NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS AVAILABILITY IN GROWING MEDIA","SOIL RESEARCH","ARTICLE",NA,2018,"10.1071/SR18022","SOIL SCIENCE","WOS:000447742800003"

IN FENS, THE VARIATION OF TRADITIONALLY USED PLOT SIZES SEEMS TO LIMIT CONTINENTAL-SCALE SYNTHESES FOLLOWING THE BRAUN-BLANQUET APPROACH. WHICH PLOT SIZES HARBOUR THE ANALOGOUS NUMBER OF HABITAT SPECIALISTS (I.E., DIAGNOSTIC/INDICATOR SPECIES) AND CAPTURE THE MAIN COMPOSITIONAL GRADIENTS IDENTICALLY? LOCATION SCANDINAVIA, CENTRAL EUROPE. METHODS THE DATA SET OF FEN VEGETATION PLOT RECORDS WAS COMPILED USING LARGE DATABASES AND CATEGORISED INTO FOUR DISTINCT HABITATS. FOR EACH HABITAT, SEMI-LOG SPECIES-AREA CURVES OF SPECIALISTS AND OTHER SPECIES WERE FITTED USING GENERALISED ADDITIVE MODELS (GAM). IN ADDITION, WE SURVEYED 72 SITES IN A SERIES OF PLOT SIZES (0.07, 0.25, 1, 4, 16 M(2)) WHERE WE APPLIED, SEPARATELY FOR EACH PLOT SIZE, NON-METRIC MULTI-DIMENSIONAL SCALING (NMDS) AND COMPARED THE RESULTING PATTERNS WITH PROCRUSTES ANALYSIS. RESULTS CONSISTENTLY ACROSS DIFFERENT FEN HABITATS, THE SPECIES-AREA CURVES OF SPECIALISTS INCREASED STEEPLY UP TO THE PLOT SIZE OF 1 M(2), WHILE INCREASING NEGLIGIBLY IN THE PLOT SIZE RANGE OF 1-25 M(2). IN CONTRAST, THE SPECIES-AREA CURVES OF OTHER SPECIES DISPLAYED MOSTLY LINEAR TO LINEAR-EXPONENTIAL TRENDS. NMDS ORDINATIONS OF MEDIUM (1 AND 4 M(2)) AND LARGE PLOTS (16 M(2)) WERE THE MOST CONGRUENT, WHILE THE PATTERNS CAPTURED IN THE ORDINATION OF THE SMALLEST PLOTS (0.07 M(2)) DIFFERED MOST FROM THE OTHERS. CONCLUSIONS IN FENS, PLOT SIZES OF AT LEAST 1 M(2) DESCRIBE SUFFICIENTLY THE BROAD-SCALE PATTERN IN SPECIALISTS' DIVERSITY AS WELL AS THE MAIN ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS.

THIRTY-TWO SAMPLES OF COAL AND CARBONACEOUS SHALE, COLLECTED FROM SURFACE MINE, OUTCROP, AND DRILL CORE LOCATIONS WERE ANALYZED GEOCHEMICALLY, PETROGRAPHICALLY AND PALYNOLOGICALLY TO ASCERTAIN THE ORIGIN OF THE BELL COAL BED IN WESTERN KENTUCKY. THE BELL COAL EXHIBITS A GREAT DEAL OF VARIABILITY IN THICKNESS AND COMPOSITION, BOTH TEMPORALLY AND SPATIALLY.

WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF LONG-TERM DRAINAGE AND HYDROLOGICAL REWETTING ON METHANOGENIC ABUNDANCE, COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND CH4 PRODUCTION POTENTIAL IN BOGS AND SPRUCE SWAMP FORESTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE SUBSTRATE LIMITATION OF METHANOGENS WAS TESTED WITH A FOCUS ON ORIGINAL PEATLAND PLANT SPECIES AND THEIR SPREADING AFTER REWETTING BY ADDITION OF NATURAL SUBSTRATES. DRAINAGE STRONGLY REDUCED THE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF THE METHANOGENIC COMMUNITY.

THIS ARTICLE DRAWS CONCLUSIONS ABOUT CHANGES IN REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS BY ANALYSING DATA FROM A GEOCHEMICALLY INTERRELATED COEVOLUTIONARY SOIL SERIES, OBTAINED BY USING A COMBINATION OF CONVENTIONAL SOIL STUDIES, PHYTOLITH ANALYSES, AND ACCELERATOR MASS SPECTROMETRY (AMS) DATING OF PHYTOLITH-OCCLUDED CARBON (PHYTOC) AND HUMIC ACIDS.

RECORDS OF SUCH HYPERTHERMALS FROM THE MARINE-TERRESTRIAL INTERFACE (E.G., ESTUARINE SWAMPS AND MIRE DEPOSITS) ARE THEREFORE OF GREAT INTEREST AS THEIR PRESENT-DAY COUNTERPARTS ARE HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO FUTURE CLIMATE AND SEA LEVEL CHANGE. HERE, WE ASSESS PALEOENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES OF MIDLATITUDINAL LATE PALEOCENE-EARLY EOCENE PEAT MIRE RECORDS ALONG THE PALEO-NORTH SEA COAST. WE PROVIDE CARBON ISOTOPE DATA OF BULK ORGANIC MATTER (DELTA(TOC)-T-13C), ORGANIC CARBON CONTENT (% TOC), AND PALYNOLOGICAL DATA FROM AN EXTENSIVE PEAT MIRE DEPOSITED AT A MIDLATITUDINAL (CA. 41 DEGREES N) COASTAL SITE (SCHONINGEN, GERMANY).

OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT HIGH WATER TABLE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION, WHILE IT HAD NO NET EFFECT ON N2O AND CH4 FLUXES. UPTAKE OF AVAILABLE N BY THE COVER CROP SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED NITRATE IN SOIL SOLUTION, THEREBY LOWERING THE POTENTIAL FOR LEACHING AND BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT N2O EMISSIONS.

HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE NOT FOUND AMONG DIFFERENT SOIL TYPES. IN TERMS OF THE WETLAND TYPE, THE HIGHEST SOCC WAS FOUND IN BOGS (P<0.05), PROBABLY DUE TO THE HIGHER MAP AND LOWER MAT.

THE CONCENTRATIONS OF NO3-, SO42- AND MG2+ WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN PEAT-VERMICULITE AND COIR SUBSTRATES THAN IN WATER CULTURE. THE PEAT-VERMICULITE SUBSTRATES GENERALLY ENHANCED CA UPTAKE BUT REDUCED P UPTAKE BY PLANTS, WHEN COMPARED TO BOTH COIR AND WATER CULTURE. COMPARED TO WATER CULTURE, FUNCTIONAL ANNOTATION ANALYSIS OF THE ROOT PROTEOME REVEALED THAT THE EXCESS NUTRIENT ACCUMULATION INDUCED COMPLEX PROTEOMIC ALTERATIONS INVOLVED IN MINERAL ION BINDING AND TRANSPORT.

LIPTINITE GROUP IS CHARACTERIZED BY PREDOMINANCE OF MICROSPORINITE AND LIPTODETRINITE, LOCALLY WITH CUTINITE AND FLUORINITE. TERPENE RESINITE AND SUBERINITE ARE RARE. LOW TPI AND HIGH GI INDICES INDICATE PEAT FORMATION FROM VEGETATION WITH LOW PRESERVATION POTENTIAL, DEPOSITED UNDER WATER-LOGGED ENVIRONMENT OF MARSH- OR FEN-TYPE. THE PALYNOLOGICAL RESULTS REVEAL A VEGETATIONAL COMMUNITY REPRESENTING DIFFERENT HABITATS (I.E. MESOPHYTIC, MARGINAL AND AQUATIC). THE RELATIVELY POOR PRESERVATION OF THE PALYNOMORPHS, HOWEVER, SUGGESTS VEGETATION THAT WAS MORE DIVERSE DURING PEAT FORMATION. ALTHOUGH GYMNOSPERM PALYNOMORPHS PREDOMINATE, THE GYMNOSPERM ORGANIC MATTER CONTRIBUTION WAS PROBABLY MINOR AS INDICATED BY THE LOW CONTENTS OF SESQUI- AND DITERPENOID BIOMARKERS. BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF TRITERPENOID BIOMARKERS OF NEITHER OLEANANE, NOR LUPANE OR URSANE-TYPE, IT IS CONSIDERED THAT ANGIOSPERMS THAT DO NOT SYNTHESIZE THEIR PRECURSORS PREDOMINATED, OR THE DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT HAD UNFAVORABLE CHARACTERISTICS, WHICH PREVENTED THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE TRITERPENOID PRECURSORS.

PAST STUDIES USING CS DATA HAVE IDENTIFIED CLEAR CONTRASTING TRENDS IN TOPSOIL ORGANIC CARBON (TSOC) CONCENTRATIONS (0-15 CM) RELATED TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HABITAT TYPES. HEREWE FIRSTLY EXAMINE CHANGES IN TSOC RESULTING FROM LAND USE CHANGE, AND SECONDLY CONSTRUCT MIXED MODELS TO DESCRIBE THE IMPACT OF INDIRECT DRIVERS WHERE LAND USE HAS BEEN CONSTANT. WHERE IT OCCURS, LAND USE CHANGE IS A STRONG DRIVER OF SOC CHANGE, WITH LARGEST CHANGES IN TSOC FOR TRANSITIONS INVOLVING SOC-RICH SOILS IN UPLAND AND BOG SYSTEMS. AFFORESTATION DID NOT ALWAYS INCREASE TSOC, AND THE EFFECT OF TRANSITIONS INVOLVINGWOODLANDWAS DEPENDENT ON THE OTHER VEGETATION TYPE. THE OVERALL NATIONAL SPATIAL PATTERN OF TSOC CONCENTRATION WHERE LAND USE HAS BEEN CONSTANT ISMOST STRONGLY RELATED TO VEGETATION TYPE AND TOPSOIL PH, WITH CONTRIBUTIONS FROM CLIMATE VARIABLES, DEPOSITION AND GEOLOGY. COMPARISONS OF MODELS FOR TSOC ACROSS TIME PERIODS SUGGEST THAT DECLINING SO4 DEPOSITION HAS ALLOWED RECOVERY OF TOPSOILS FROM ACIDIFICATION, BUT THAT THIS HAS NOT RESULTED IN THE INCREASED DECOMPOSITION RATES AND LOSS OF TSOC WHICH MIGHT BE EXPECTED. AS A RESULT, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PH AND TSOC IN UK TOPSOILS HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN 1978 AND 2007. THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OTHER INDIRECT DRIVERS IN THE MODELS SUGGEST NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIPS TO SEASONAL TEMPERATURE METRICS AND POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS TO SEASONAL PRECIPITATION AT THE DRY END OF THE SCALE. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE CS APPROACH OF LONG-TERM COLLECTION OF CO-LOCATED VEGETATION AND SOIL BIOPHYSICAL DATA PROVIDES ESSENTIAL TOOLS BOTH FOR IDENTIFYING TRENDS IN TSOC AT NATIONAL AND HABITAT LEVELS, AND FOR IDENTIFYING AREAS OF RISK OR AREAS WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR MANAGING TOPSOIL SOC AND VEGETATION CHANGE.

THE UPPER LAYER OF THE SUBGRADE ON PARTS OF THE RAIL SECTION IS PEAT (DEPTHS OF UP TO 2 M), WHILE IT IS MORAINE ON OTHERS LEADING TO A SIGNIFICANT LONGITUDINAL VARIATION IN SUBSTRUCTURE STIFFNESS. THE DEGRADATION RATES OF IRREGULARITIES IN THE LONGITUDINAL LEVEL AND THE INFLUENCE OF TRACK MAINTENANCE (TAMPING) ON THE TRACK GEOMETRY ARE STUDIED. IN PARALLEL, A METHOD FOR CONTINUOUS MEASUREMENT OF TRACK VERTICAL STIFFNESS ALONG THE LINE, ALLOWING FOR THE DETECTION OF TRACK SECTIONS WITH POOR SUPPORT CONDITIONS, IS DESCRIBED AND DEMONSTRATED. SYNCHRONISED MEASUREMENTS OF THE LONGITUDINAL LEVEL AND THE TRACK VERTICAL STIFFNESS ARE EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN A HIGH STIFFNESS GRADIENT DUE TO VARIATIONS IN SUBSTRUCTURE STIFFNESS AND A HIGH GROWTH RATE OF LOCAL TRACK GEOMETRY IRREGULARITIES. IT IS SHOWN THAT RECURRENT SEVERE LOCAL TRACK GEOMETRY IRREGULARITIES OFTEN OCCUR ON TRACK SECTIONS WHERE THERE IS A COMBINATION OF A LOW MAGNITUDE AND A HIGH GRADIENT IN THE SUBSTRUCTURE STIFFNESS. IN SUCH CASES, TAMPING MAY NOT BE A COST-EFFICIENT LONG-TERM SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. INSTEAD, UPGRADING OF BALLAST AND SUBGRADE LAYERS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS AN OPTION.

RESULTS SOIL FE WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN REGION OR SOIL CA, AND P AVAILABILITY TO THE VEGETATION INCREASED FROM FE-POOR TO FE-RICH FENS. CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS, PRECIPITATION OF IRON PHOSPHATES PLAYED A MINOR ROLE IN FE-RICH FENS.

SUCH P WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY DERIVED FROM VOLCANIC SOURCES, WITH P BEING PRESENT IN THE VOLCANIC GLASS AT MOANATUATUA, AND MANY OF THE ERUPTIONS DESCRIBED BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOCAL DEPOSITION OF THE P RICH MINERAL APATITE. WE FOUND PEATLAND C ACCUMULATION TO BE TIGHTLY COUPLED TO N AND P ACCUMULATION, SUGGESTING NUTRIENT INPUTS EXERT A STRONG CONTROL ON RATES OF PEAT ACCUMULATION. NUTRIENT STOICHIOMETRY INDICATED A STRONG ABILITY TO RECOVER P WITHIN THE ECOSYSTEM, WITH C:P RATIOS BEING HIGHER THAN MOST OTHER PEATLANDS IN THE LITERATURE. WE CONCLUDE THAT NUTRIENT INPUTS, DERIVING FROM VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS, HAVE BEEN VERY IMPORTANT FOR C ACCUMULATION RATES IN THE PAST. THEREFORE, THE ELEVATED NUTRIENT INPUTS OCCURRING IN THE PRESENT DAY COULD OFFER A MORE PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION, AS OPPOSED TO A CLIMATIC COMPONENT, FOR OBSERVED HIGH CONTEMPORARY C ACCUMULATION IN NEW ZEALAND PEATLANDS.

PHENOL OXIDASE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE DECOMPOSITION OF ORGANIC MATTER IN PEATLANDS, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""ENZYMATIC LATCH"". HOWEVER, OUR RECENT STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT THE FORMATION OF IRON-ORGANIC MATTER (FE-OM) ASSOCIATIONS IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE PRESENCE OF LACCASE, THE LARGEST CLASS OF PHENOL OXIDASES IN SOILS. AS THE FORMATION OF FE-OM ASSOCIATIONS IS RECOGNIZED AS AN IMPORTANT STABILIZATION MECHANISM FOR SOIL ORGANIC MATTER, FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF THE POTENTIAL MECHANISMS CONTRIBUTES TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF LACCASE IN PEATLAND CARBON SEQUESTRATION. IN THIS STUDY, A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS USING DIFFERENT PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS AND PEAT-DERIVED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER (DOM) WERE PERFORMED. THE RESULTS FROM LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY-HIGH-RESOLUTION MASS SPECTROMETRY (LC-HRMS) AND GEL PERMEATION CHROMATOGRAPHY (GPC) ANALYSES INDICATED THAT LACCASE CATALYZED THE POLYMERIZATION OF PHENOLICS AND PEAT-DERIVED DOM BY COUPLING OF THE C-O BOND, THE C-C BOND AND THE C-C/C-O BONDS. THE POLYMERIZED PRODUCTS CAN COMBINE MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH FE TO FORM FE-OM ASSOCIATIONS.

WE USED LARGE MESOCOSMS IN THE PEATCOSM EXPERIMENT TO ASSESS CHANGES IN PEATLAND DOM AND REDOX POTENTIAL IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATIONS OF WATER TABLE (WT) POSITION AND PLANT FUNCTIONAL GROUPS (PFGS). WT POSITION AND PFGS INTERACTED IN THEIR EFFECTS ON REDOX POTENTIAL AND QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF DOM. PHENOLICS WERE GENERALLY OF HIGHER MOLECULAR WEIGHT AND MORE OXIDIZED WITH SEDGES IN LOWERED WTS. ALTERED DOM CHARACTER INCLUDED CHANGES IN DISSOLVED NITROGEN (N), WITH HIGHER N: [PHENOLICS] WITH HIGHER E4:E6 (ABSORBANCE RATIO LAMBDA = 465:665) DOM IN THE LOWERED WT AND SEDGE PFG TREATMENTS.

PEAT C STAYS LOCKED UP IN THESE ECOSYSTEMS LARGELY OWING TO COOL AND WET CONDITIONS, AND AS SUCH, THESE C STORES ARE VULNERABLE TO RELEASE BACK TO THE ATMOSPHERE IF THE CLIMATE OR WATER LEVELS CHANGE.

WE MANIPULATED BOTH FACTORS IN AN EXPERIMENTAL SETTING COMPOSED OF 24 LARGE BINS INTO WHICH WE PUT INTACT PEATLAND MINIECOSYSTEMS.

IN ADDITION, ACTIVITIES OF SEDGE ROOTS AND OTHER DOMINANT PLANT COMMUNITIES (SUCH AS SHRUBS IN THE HEATH FAMILY OF PLANTS) MAY INTERACT IN THE SYNTHESIS OF OXIDIZED, LARGER MOLECULES.

THE DECOMPOSITION OF PEAT C IN THESE SYSTEMS DEPENDS ON ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS - SUCH AS WATER TABLE LEVELS AND CORRESPONDING AVAILABILITY OF ELECTRON ACCEPTORS FOR MICROBIAL RESPIRATION. DUE TO THE LATTER, POTENTIAL PEAT DECOMPOSITION DEPENDS ALSO ON WHETHER THE MATERIAL IS INITIALLY OXIDIZED OR REDUCED PRIOR TO DECOMPOSITION EXPERIMENTS. RECENT STUDIES REVEALED THE IMPORTANCE OF SILICON (SI) FOR PEAT DECOMPOSITION. HIGH AMOUNTS OF BIOGENIC SI WERE FOUND IN PEATLANDS, IN PARTICULAR IN MINEROTROPHIC FENS, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SI FOR GRAMINOIDS AND DECOMPOSABILITY OF RESPECTIVE LITTER HAS BEEN WIDELY DISCUSSED. FURTHERMORE, THE AVAILABILITY OF SI WAS REPORTED TO INFLUENCE THE BINDING OF PHOSPHORUS (P) TO IRON (FE) AND THEREBY THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH DECOMPOSITION PROCEEDS. YET THE INFLUENCE OF SI ON GREENHOUSE GAS PRODUCTION IN PEAT UNDER DIFFERENT INITIAL REDOX CONDITIONS IS LARGELY UNKNOWN. THEREFORE, WE INTENDED TO TEST THE EFFECT OF SI ON GREENHOUSE GAS PRODUCTION UNDER DIFFERENT INITIAL ELECTRON ACCEPTOR AVAILABILITIES FOR MICROBIAL RESPIRATION, SUCH AS THE AVAILABILITY OF FERRIC FE. WE CONDUCTED TWO INCUBATION EXPERIMENTS WITH INITIALLY OXIDIZED AND REDUCED PEAT ORGANIC MATTER (OM). WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT SI CAN MOBILIZE P FROM FE MINERALS, WHICH INCREASES MICROBIAL ACTIVITY, AND LEADS TO HIGHER PRODUCTION RATES OF CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) AND METHANE (CH4). USING THE TWO DIFFERENT MATERIALS, WE STUDIED HOW INITIAL REDOX CONDITIONS WOULD MODIFY EFFECTS OF SI. AS THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF FE AS EITHER FERRIC FE-(OXY)HYDROXIDES OR AS FERROUS FE MINERALS (SULFIDES, CARBONATES) IS IMPORTANT FOR INTERACTION WITH SI, WE FURTHER HYPOTHESIZED THAT SI EFFECTS SHOULD BE STRONGER IN INITIALLY OXIDIZED PEAT IN PRESENCE OF FERRIC FE, COMPARED TO INITIALLY REDUCED PEAT WITH FERROUS FE ONLY. FOR INCUBATION EXPERIMENTS USING FORMERLY OXIDIZED MATERIAL THE SI ADDITION INCREASED P CONCENTRATIONS IN THE PORE WATER, AND MORE CO2 WAS PRODUCED. THE ONSET OF METHANOGENESIS WAS MUCH STRONGER WITH THAN WITHOUT ADDITION OF SI, INDICATING A MORE RAPID DEPLETION OF ELECTRON ACCEPTORS BY FASTER RATES OF RESPIRATION. WE EXPLAIN THIS BY MORE P BEING AVAILABLE STIMULATING MICROBIAL ACTIVITY, AND ALSO BY A DIRECT EFFECT OF SI ON MICROBIAL ACTIVITY AND METHANOGENESIS. THE INCUBATION OF FORMERLY REDUCED OM DID NOT SHOW ANY EFFECTS OF SI ON RESPIRATION PROCESSES, PRESUMABLY DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF FERRIC FE PHASES. IN CONCLUSION, THERE WAS A CLEAR DIFFERENCE IN THE EFFECT OF SI ADDITION ON DECOMPOSITION OF FORMERLY OXIDIZED COMPARED TO LONG TERM REDUCED OM, WITH ONLY OXIDIZED PEAT OM OR PEAT WITH FERRIC FE PHASES PRESENT SHOWING CLEAR SI EFFECTS. CONSEQUENTLY, REDOX CONDITIONS AND AVAILABILITY OF FERRIC FE ARE A MAIN CONTROL FOR SI EFFECTS ON OM DECOMPOSITION AND NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY.

THE PROFILE DISTRIBUTION OF THE NUMBER AVERAGE MOLECULAR WEIGHTS OF HUMIC ACIDS OF THE TWO PLOTS HAS A BIMODAL CHARACTER, WITH MAXIMUM VALUES IN THE UPPER AND LOWER PARTS OF THE PROFILE. HIGH VALUES IN THE UPPER PART OF THE PROFILE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESENCE OF LONG UNBRANCHED CARBON CHAINS OF PARAFFIN FRAGMENTS AND FRAGMENTS OF OLIGO- AND POLYSACCHARIDES, LEADING TO INCREASE IN THE LINEAR DIMENSIONS OF HUMIC ACID MOLECULES.

ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH RESTORING THE UNDERSTORY IS THE PRESENCE OF NON-NATIVE SPECIES THAT COMPETE WITH DESIRABLE NATIVE SPECIES FOR RESOURCES. IN A GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENT, WE STUDIED THE GROWTH OF TWO NATIVE UNDERSTORY SPECIES (GALIUM BOREALE AND VICIA AMERICANA) AND A NON-NATIVE INVASIVE SPECIES (MATRICARIA PERFORATA) GROWN WITH EITHER INTRA- OR INTERSPECIFIC NEIGHBORS ACROSS THREE COMMON LAND RECLAMATION SOILS AND A NITROGEN FERTILIZER TREATMENT. RESULTS: WHEN GROWN BY ITSELF, V. AMERICANA ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS DID NOT DIFFER AMONG SOIL OR FERTILIZER TREATMENTS, LIKELY DUE TO ITS ABILITY TO FIX NITROGEN. GROWTH OF M. PERFORATA WAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO SOIL NITROGEN, AND IT HAD THE GREATEST INCREASE IN BIOMASS WITH FERTILIZATION. GROWTH AND BIOMASS OF G.

HOWEVER, NOT ALL SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS ARE SUITABLE FOR THIS DUE TO LARGE DISTANCE FROM HUMAN SETTLEMENTS OR ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. IN THIS STUDY WE ADDRESS THE QUESTION WHETHER NATURAL WILD LARGE UNGULATES CAN BE A USEFUL MANAGEMENT TOOL AS WELL. IN NUTRIENT-LIMITED SYSTEMS, LARGE HERBIVORES CAN AFFECT VEGETATION DYNAMICS BY REDISTRIBUTION OF NUTRIENTS NEXT TO THEIR DIRECT EFFECTS ON THE VEGETATION. THEY CAN PREFERENTIALLY FORAGE PLANT SPECIES AND DEPOSIT THEIR PELLETS AT OTHER LOCATIONS LEADING TO NUTRIENT REDISTRIBUTION. WE STUDIED WHETHER MOOSE (ALCES ALCES) IN THE BIEBRZA NATIONAL PARK (POLAND), PLAYS A ROLE IN NITROGEN DYNAMICS. MICROSCOPIC ANALYSES OF FAECES SHOWED THAT 57% OF THE DIET CONSISTED OF SALIX CINEREA, WHICH WAS PREFERENTIALLY FORAGED UPON INDICATED BY A POSITIVE JACOBS' SELECTIVITY INDEX. PELLET DENSITY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN PATCHES OF S. CINEREA COMPARED TO THE SURROUNDING VEGETATION. BASED ON THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF MOOSE PELLETS AND THE PELLET DENSITY, WE CALCULATED THAT MOOSE-DERIVED N (FAECES AND URINE) LEADS TO A RELEVANT N-INPUT IN WILLOW PATCHES COMPARED TO OTHER SOURCES OF N IN THE SYSTEM. WE SHOW THAT MOOSE DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE NITROGEN BETWEEN DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES BUT INSTEAD SPEED UP THE LOCAL RECYCLING OF NITROGEN IN PATCHES DOMINATED BY WILLOWS DURING THE GROWING SEASON. AS A CONSEQUENCE, NUTRIENTS BECOME QUICKER AVAILABLE HERE THAN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE SYSTEM.

IN THIS STUDY, P FORMS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION WITH DEPTH WERE INVESTIGATED IN TWO CULTIVATED HISTOSOL PROFILES, USING A COMBINATION OF WET CHEMICAL EXTRACTION AND P K-EDGE X-RAY ABSORPTION NEAR-EDGE STRUCTURE (XANES) SPECTROSCOPY. BOTH PROFILES HAD ELEVATED P CONTENT IN THE TOPSOIL, AMOUNTING TO AROUND 40 MMOL KG(-1), AND P SPECIATION IN BOTH PROFILES WAS STRONGLY DOMINATED BY ORGANIC P. TOPSOILS WERE PARTICULARLY RICH IN ORGANIC P (P-ORG), WITH RELATIVE PROPORTIONS OF UP TO 80%. INORGANIC P IN THE PROFILES WAS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ADSORBED TO SURFACE REACTIVE ALUMINIUM (AL) AND IRON (FE) MINERALS. IN ONE OF THE PRO-FILES, SMALL CONTRIBUTIONS OF CA-PHOSPHATES WERE DETECTED. A COMMONLY USED P SATURATION INDEX (PSI) BASED ON AMMONIUM-OXALATE EXTRACTION INDICATED A LOW TO MODERATE RISK OF P LEACHING FROM BOTH PROFILES. HOWEVER, THE CAPACITY OF SOIL AL AND FE TO RETAIN P IN ORGANIC SOILS COULD BE REDUCED BY HIGH COMPETITION FROM ORGANIC COMPOUNDS FOR SORPTION SITES. THIS IS NOT DIRECTLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN PSI AND SIMILAR INDICES. ACCUMULATION OF P-ORG IN THE TOPSOIL MAY BE ATTRIBUTABLE BY MICROBIAL PEAT DECOMPOSITION AND TRANSFORMATION OF MINERAL FERTILISER P BY BOTH MICROBIOTA AND CROPS.

MOST BASAL PEAT AGES OCCURRED AFTER SEA-LEVEL RISE SLOWED (AFTER SIMILAR TO 4,000 YEARS BEFORE PRESENT), BUT PREDOMINANCE OF SEA-LEVEL RISE STUDIES MAY SKEW AGE ESTIMATES TOWARD OLDER SITES. NEAR-COASTAL SITES TENDED TO BE YOUNGER, INDICATING CREATION OF WETLANDS THROUGH BASIN INFILLING AND OVERWASH EVENTS. AGE DISTRIBUTIONS DIFFERED AMONG REGIONS, WITH YOUNGER WETLANDS IN THE NORTHEAST AND SOUTHEAST CORRESPONDING TO EUROPEAN COLONIZATION AND DEFORESTATION. ACROSS ALL CORES, WETLAND AGE CORRELATED STRONGLY WITH BASAL PEAT DEPTH. MARSH AGE ELUCIDATES THE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SEA-LEVEL RISE, SEDIMENT SUPPLY, AND GEOMORPHIC SETTING IN DETERMINING TIMING AND LOCATION OF MARSH FORMATION AND FUTURE WETLAND PERSISTENCE. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY MARSHES, A TYPE OF COASTAL WETLAND, FORM UNDER STABLE, SLOW RATES OF SEA-LEVEL RISE (SLR). ALTHOUGH MANY MARSHES ALONG THE EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES FORMED AFTER THE MOST RECENT SLOWING OF SLR (APPROXIMATELY 4,000-6,000 YEARS AGO), THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT SEDIMENT EROSION FROM COLONIAL DEFORESTATION EXPANDED MARSHES. THIS STUDY USES SEDIMENT CORES TO DETERMINE WHEN AND WHERE MARSHES FORMED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT DRIVES MODERN MARSH FORMATION. WE FOUND THAT MOST MARSHES DID FORM FOLLOWING SLR SLOWING AFTER AROUND 4,000 YEARS AGO. WE ALSO FOUND EVIDENCE OF MARSHES FORMING DURING EUROPEAN COLONIZATION IN THE NORTHEASTERN AND SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. FINALLY, WE FOUND RECENT FORMATION OF MARSHES CLOSEST TO THE COAST, POSSIBLY DRIVEN BY STORM EVENTS AND ASSOCIATED OVERWASH. THROUGH THIS STUDY, WE OUTLINE A NOVEL WAY TO EASILY DETERMINE MARSH AGE AND TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHY MARSHES FORM THROUGH FUTURE RESEARCH.","HOW OLD ARE MARSHES ON THE EAST COAST, USA?

PALEOENVIRONMENTAL RECONSTRUCTIONS DOCUMENTING THE INCEPTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THESE ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT WATER BODIES ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO PLEISTOCENE-AGE PERMAFROST DEPOSITS OF SIBERIA, ALASKA, AND THE WESTERN CANADIAN ARCTIC. HERE WE PRESENT THE GRADUAL TRANSITION FROM SYNGENETIC ICE-WEDGE POLYGON TERRAIN TO A THERMOKARST LAKE IN HOLOCENE SEDIMENTS OF THE EASTERN CANADIAN ARCTIC. WE COMBINE GEOMORPHOLOGICAL SURVEYS WITH PALEOLIMNOLOGICAL RECONSTRUCTIONS FROM SEDIMENT CORES IN AN EFFORT TO CHARACTERIZE LOCAL LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION FROM A TERRESTRIAL TO FRESHWATER ENVIRONMENT.

CURRENTLY, AREAS WITH UNDISTURBED SOILS ARE MAINLY PRESERVED WITHIN SPECIALLY PROTECTED NATURAL AREAS. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF REFERENCE SOILS SERVE AS A STARTING POINT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING. ONE OF THESE OBJECTS IS POLISTOVSKY RESERVE IN PSKOV REGION, CREATED TO PROTECT THE UPPER MARSHES. ON THE TERRITORY OF THE RESERVE AMONG THE WETLANDS, UNIQUE LANDSCAPES ARE PRESENT, I.E. MINERAL ISLANDS, FORMED BY POSTGLACIAL MORAINIC DEPOSITS, NOT BURIED UNDER A LAYER OF PEAT, ON WHICH SOILS, THAT ARE UNUSUAL FOR THE GIVEN TERRAIN, DEVELOPED UNDER MIXED FORESTS. AUTOMORPHIC SOILS, FORMED WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THESE ISOLATED FORMATIONS, REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THE RELEVANCE OF THE PRESENTED RESEARCH IS DUE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF MINERAL ISLAND SOILS AS ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS OF THE NATURAL SYSTEMS OF THE POLISTOVO-LOVATSKY BOG MASSIF. DATA ON THE COMPOSITION AND PROPERTIES OF AUTONOMOUS SOILS CAN BE USED IN THE PLANNING OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MEASURES, AS WELL AS TO PREDICT THEIR STABILITY IN THE INTENSIFICATION OF ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACT. THE AIM OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO IDENTIFY ACCUMULATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF TOTAL CONTENT AND MOBILE FORMS OF MN, FE, NI, CU, ZN, AND PB IN VARIOUS TYPES OF AUTOMORPHIC SOILS IN POLISTOVSKY STATE NATURE RESERVE. THE AUTOMORPHIC SOILS OF POLISTOVSKY RESERVE (57 DEGREES 10'N, 30 DEGREES 30'E), FORMED WITHIN THE MINERAL ISLANDS, WERE INVESTIGATED: EUTRIC CAMBISOL, HAPLIC LUVISOL, RENDZIC LEPTOSOL AND RUBIC ARENOSOL (SEE FIG. 1). WE STUDIED SOILS USING PROFILE AND GENETIC METHODS BASED ON THE CLASSIFICATION AND DIAGNOSTICS OF RUSSIAN SOILS (SHISHOV LL ET AL., 2004). INTERNATIONAL NAMES ARE GIVEN ACCORDING TO THE WORLD REFERENCE BASE OF SOIL RESOURCES, VERSION 2015 (IUSS WORKING GROUP WRB, 2015). THE FOLLOWING SOIL PROPERTIES WERE DETERMINED: PARTICLE SIZE FRACTIONS BY PIPET ANALYSIS (KATSCHINSKI NA, 1956, BURT R, 2011), ORGANIC CARBON CONTENT BY BICHROMATE OXIDATION METHOD ACCORDING TO IV TYURIN, EXCHANGEABLE BASES BY COMPLEXOMETRIC METHOD, CATION EXCHANGE CAPACITY BY AMMONIUM ACETATE METHOD, KCL PH AND PH OF AQUEOUS SUSPENSION BY POTENTIOMETRIC METHOD (VOROBEVA LA, 2006; BURT R, 2011). THE TOTAL CONTENT OF MN, FE, NI, CU, ZN AND PB WAS DETERMINED BY X-RAY FLUORESCENCE ANALYSIS USING A SPECTROMETER SPECTROSCAN MAX-GV ""SPECTRON"" (RUSSIA), AND THE CONTENT OF MOBILE FORMS EXTRACTED FROM THE SOIL BY AMMONIUM ACETATE BUFFER (MOTUZOVA GV ET AL., 2014) WAS DETERMINED BY ATOMIC ABSORPTION USING A SPECTROMETER NOVAA300 ""ANALYTIK JENA"" (GERMANY). CLARKES OF CONCENTRATION AND CLARKES OF DISPERSION OF ELEMENTS IN THE STUDIED SOILS WERE CALCULATED RELATIVE TO THE CLARKE OF ELEMENTS IN THE SOILS ACCORDING TO AP VINOGRADOV (1957). A CORRELATION ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT TO EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF SOILS AND THE CONTENT OF ELEMENTS WITH THE CALCULATION OF SPEARMANS RANK ORDER CORRELATION COEFFICIENT. IN THIS RESEARCH, WE FOUND OUT THAT THE LITHOLOGICAL HETEROGENEITY OF THE SOIL-FORMING ROCKS OF MINERAL ISLANDS LEADS TO A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENTIATION OF SOILS BOTH BY MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES AND BY PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES. EUTRIC CAMBISOLS FORM ON MORAINE LOAMS ON THE SLOPES UNDER OAK FORESTS WITH THIN GRASS COVER, WHILE HAPLIC LUVISOLS ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF SPRUCE FORESTS. RUBIC ARENOSOLS ARE COMMON IN BINOMIAL DEPOSITS UNDER A MIXED BIRCH AND SPRUCE FOREST. RENDZIC LEPTOSOLS ARE CONFINED TO SANDY SEDIMENTS. THE CONSIDERED SOILS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT IN A RANGE OF PARAMETERS (SEE TABLE 1). THE TYPICAL DIFFERENTIATION OF THE PROFILE ACCORDING TO THE CONTENT OF PHYSICAL CLAY IS CHARACTERISTIC OF EUTRIC CAMBISOLS AND HAPLIC LUVISOLS. IN TERMS OF PH VALUES, EUTRIC CAMBISOLS AND HAPLIC LUVISOLS ARE DEFINED AS ACIDIC SOILS, RUBIC ARENOSOLS ARE SLIGHTLY ACIDIC OR NEUTRAL, AND RENDZIC LEPTOSOLS ARE SLIGHTLY OR MODERATELY ALKALINE. THE ORGANIC CARBON CONTENT IN THE HORIZON AY OF RENDZIC LEPTOSOLS IS 2 TIMES LOWER, WHILE IN EUTRIC CAMBISOLS AND HAPLIC LUVISOLS IT IS 4-7 TIMES LOWER THAN IN RUBIC ARENOSOLS. THE STUDIED SOILS ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY THE CONTENT AND PROFILE DISTRIBUTION OF ELEMENTS (SEE TABLE 2). WITH THE DEPTHS, THE TOTAL CONTENT OF ELEMENTS IN HAPLIC LUVISOLS AND RUBIC ARENOSOL INCREASES, WHILE IN RENDZIC LEPTOSOL IT DECREASES. IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT THE TOTAL CONTENT OF ELEMENTS IN AUTOMORPHIC SOILS WAS REDUCED IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER: FE> MN> ZN> NI> CU> PB. THE PROPORTION OF MOBILE FORMS RELATIVE TO THE TOTAL CONTENT WAS MINIMAL FOR FE (0.002-0.08%), ESPECIALLY IN RENDZIC LEPTOSOLS (0.003-0.02%), FOR OTHER ELEMENTS IT VARIED FROM 0.3 TO 10.7%. THE TOTAL CONTENT OF NI, PB AND FE IS HIGHER IN RUBIC ARENOSOLS THAN IN A HAPLIC LUVISOLS AND RENDZIC LEPTOSOLS (SEE TABLE 3). THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MORAINE DEPOSITS DETERMINE THE CONDITIONS FOR MIGRATION AND ACCUMULATION OF ELEMENTS (SEE TABLE 4). AN INCREASE IN THE TOTAL CONTENT OF NI, CU, ZN, AND FE IS LINKED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF SILTY PARTICLES IN THE SOILS; THEIR MAXIMUM VALUES ARE NOTED IN THE LOWER HORIZONS OF THE SOIL. MN ACCUMULATION WAS OBSERVED IN SANDY HORIZONS WITH HIGH HUMUS CONTENT. HIGH PH VALUES LEAD TO ACCUMULATION OF MOBILE FORMS OF NI AND MN, WHILE LOW VALUES LEAD TO ACCUMULATION OF MOBILE FORMS OF FE. MOBILE FORMS OF MN, FE, NI AND PB ARE ACCUMULATED IN THE ORGANOGENIC HORIZONS. IT WAS REVEALED THAT FE AND MN IN THE SOILS OF THE CONSIDERED LANDSCAPES WERE TYPOMORPHIC ELEMENTS WHOSE CONTENT SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCES THE BEHAVIOR OF NI, CU, ZN AND PB. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SOILS OF AUTONOMOUS POSITIONS, EVEN DESPITE THE LIMITED DISTRIBUTION AREA WITHIN POLISTOVSKY RESERVE, DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT DIVERSITY.

WE SPECIFICALLY EVALUATED TOLERANCE OF CORN TO SALINITY STRESS AND CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF SALINE SOIL (VIZ., REDOX POTENTIAL, CONDUCTIVITY, AND PHYTOTOXICITY) USING A FACTORIAL POT EXPERIMENT, MODELING NACL SALINITY LEVELS OF 0, 50, 100, 150, AND 200 MM UNDER GREENHOUSE CONDITIONS. GROWTH, WATER BALANCE, PHOTOSYNTHESIS, CATALASE ACTIVITY, AND ACCUMULATION OF NONENZYMATIC ANTIOXIDANTS (FLAVONOIDS AND ANTHOCYANINS) WERE MEASURED AND EVALUATED. SALINITY STRESS REDUCED SHOOT AND ROOT BIOMASS BY 8-49%, PHOTOSYNTHETIC PIGMENT CONTENT IN LEAVES BY 15-30%, DETERIORATED WATER BALANCE, AND ACTIVATED NONSPECIFIC ADAPTIVE REACTIONS (I.E., ACCUMULATION OF ENZYMATIC AND NONENZYMATIC ANTIOXIDANTS) IN THE CORN SEEDLINGS.

THE AREA UNDER STUDY WERE DRAINED IN 1980 BY A NETWORK OF OPEN CHANNELS FOR THE PURPOSE OF FOREST MELIORATION AND PEAT EXTRACTION. THE LACK OF PLANTING AND REPAIR OF THE DRAINAGE NETWORK HAS LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SELF-RECOVERY PROCESSES IN DRAINED MIRES. FIELD STUDIES OF THE SITES INCLUDED THE ACCESS OF PEAT DEPOSIT DEPTHS, SELECTING STRATIGRAPHIC LAYER BY TYPE AND DEGREE OF DECOMPOSITION OF PEAT BY VISUAL METHOD; SAMPLING PEAT IN STEPS OF 5 CM TO A DEPTH OF 90 CM USING A RUSSIAN PEAT CORER.

AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY, IT IS SHOWN THAT THE BULK DENSITY OF PEAT CHARACTERIZES THE RATE OF ACCUMULATION OF PEAT AND IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE ASH CONTENT AND THE DEGREE OF DECOMPOSITION. THE INCREASE IN DENSITY IN THE PEAT LAYER AT DEPTHS UP TO 25 CM CORRESPONDS TO THE PERIOD OF PEAT ACCUMULATION DURING THE MAXIMUM EFFECT OF DRAINAGE. THE CHANGE IN ASH CONTENT WITH DEPTH AND A MAXIMUM VALUE IN THE LAYER OF 15-35 CM IS AN INDICATOR OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE PEAT LAYER LOCATED ON THE SURFACE DURING THE FIRST YEARS AFTER DRAINAGE, AND IS GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE LAWS OF BULK DENSITY CHANGES IN DEPTH.

BOGS OCCUR FREQUENTLY ON THE NORTHERN ALBERTA LANDSCAPE, ESTIMATED TO COVER 6% OF THE ATHABASCA OIL SANDS AREA. AS A RESULT OF OIL SAND EXTRACTION AND PROCESSING, EMISSIONS OF NITROGEN (N) AND SULFUR (S) TO THE ATMOSPHERE HAVE LED TO INCREASING N AND S DEPOSITION THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ALTER THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THESE TRADITIONALLY NUTRIENT-POOR ECOSYSTEMS. AT PRESENT, NO DETAILED PROTOCOL IS AVAILABLE FOR MONITORING POTENTIAL CHANGE OF THESE SENSITIVE ECOSYSTEMS. WE PROPOSE A USER-FRIENDLY PROTOCOL THAT WILL MONITOR POTENTIAL PLANT AND LICHEN RESPONSES TO FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL INPUTS OF NUTRIENTS AND PROVIDE A STRUCTURED MEANS FOR COLLECTING ANNUAL DATA. THE PROTOCOL CENTERS ON MEASUREMENT OF FIVE KEY PLANT/LICHEN ATTRIBUTES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN (1) PLANT ABUNDANCES, (2) DOMINANT SHRUB ANNUAL GROWTH AND PRIMARY PRODUCTION, (3) LICHEN HEALTH ESTIMATED THROUGH CHLOROPHYLL/PHAEOPHYTIN CONCENTRATIONS, (4) SPHAGNUM ANNUAL GROWTH AND PRODUCTION, AND (5) ANNUAL GROWTH OF THE DOMINANT TREE SPECIES (PICEA MARIANA). WE PLACED FIVE PERMANENT PLOTS IN EACH OF SIX BOGS LOCATED AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES FROM THE CENTER OF OIL SAND EXTRACTION AND SAMPLED THESE FOR 2 YEARS (2018 AND 2019). WE COMPARED LINE INTERCEPT WITH POINT INTERCEPT PLANT ASSESSMENTS USING NMDS ORDINATION, CONCLUDING THAT BOTH METHODS PROVIDE COMPARABLE DATA. THESE DATA INDICATED THAT EACH OF OUR SIX BOG SITES DIFFER IN KEY SPECIES ABUNDANCES. STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES WERE APPARENT FOR THE SIX SITES BETWEEN YEARS. THESE DIFFERENCES WERE MOSTLY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN VACCINIUM OXYCOCCOS, NOT THE DOMINANT SHRUBS. WE DEVELOPED ALLOMETRIC GROWTH EQUATIONS FOR THE DOMINANT TWO SHRUBS (RHODODENDRON GROENLANDICUM AND CHAMAEDAPHNE CALYCULATA). EQUATIONS DEVELOPED FOR EACH OF THE SIX SITES PRODUCED GROWTH VALUES THAT WERE NOT DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER NOR FROM ONE DEVELOPED USING DATA FROM ALL SITES. ANNUAL GROWTH OF R. GROENLANDICUM DIFFERED BETWEEN SITES, BUT NOT YEARS, WHEREAS GROWTH OF C. CALYCULATA DIFFERED BETWEEN THE 2 YEARS WITH MORE GROWTH IN 2018 COMPARED WITH 2019. IN COMPARISON, SPHAGNUM PLANT DENSITY AND STEM BULK DENSITY BOTH HAD STRONG SITE DIFFERENCES, WITH STEM MASS DENSITY HIGHER IN 2019. WHEN COMBINED, ANNUAL PRODUCTION OF S. FUSCUM WAS GREATER IN 2019 AT THREE SITES AND NOT DIFFERENT AT THREE OF THE SITES. CHLOROPHYLL AND PHAEOPHYTIN CONCENTRATIONS FROM THE EPIPHYTIC LICHEN EVERNIA MESOMORPHA ALSO DIFFERED BETWEEN SITES AND YEARS. THIS PROTOCOL FOR FIELD ASSESSMENTS OF FIVE KEY PLANT/LICHEN RESPONSE VARIABLES INDICATED THAT BOTH SITE AND YEAR ARE FACTORS THAT MUST BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN FUTURE ASSESSMENTS.

THE DISEASE CAUSES SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC LOSSES DUE TO ITS EFFECT ON FEED CONVERSION RATIO AND LIVER CONDEMNATIONS AT SLAUGHTER (LIVER MILK SPOTS). THIS STUDY AIMED TO CHARACTERISE THE BETWEEN-FARM AND SPATIAL VARIANCE IN PORCINE ASCARIASIS IN ENGLAND AND TO ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE PERCENTAGE OF INFECTED ANIMALS AND POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING PRODUCTION SYSTEM, SOCIOECONOMIC DEPRIVATION, SOIL CHARACTERISTICS (PH, TOPSOIL BULK DENSITY, TOPSOIL ORGANIC MATTER, TOPSOIL TEXTURE CLASS, SOIL WATER REGIME, TOPSOIL AVAILABLE WATER CAPACITY, AND ELEVATION), AND CLIMATIC CONDITIONS (RELATIVE HUMIDITY, AIR TEMPERATURE, AND RAINFALL) BEFORE SLAUGHTER. POST-MORTEM INSPECTION RESULTS WERE PROVIDED BY THE FOOD STANDARDS AGENCY AND COMPRISED INFORMATION ABOUT THE NUMBER OF REJECTED LIVERS, THE NUMBER OF ANIMALS SENT TO SLAUGHTER AND THE PRODUCTION SYSTEM. ALL FARMS WERE GEOREFERENCED BASED ON THE POSTCODE, WHICH ALLOWED THE ASSESSMENT OF THE AREA INDEX OF SOCIOECONOMIC DEPRIVATION AND THE EXTRACTION OF SOIL AND CLIMATIC CHARACTERISTICS AVAILABLE IN DIFFERENT ONLINE DATABASES. UNDER A MULTILEVEL FRAMEWORK WITH ADJUSTMENT FOR SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION, A STANDARD LINEAR MIXED MODEL WAS FITTED TO ESTIMATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THESE DETERMINANTS AND THE PERCENTAGE OF INFECTED ANIMALS. FROM 2,513,973 ENGLISH FARMED PIGS INCLUDED IN THE STUDY, 4.3% HAD THEIR LIVERS REJECTED DUE TO MILK SPOTS. THE PERCENTAGE OF INFECTED PIGS PER BATCH RANGED FROM 0% TO 100%. THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGES WERE FOUND IN SURREY, EAST AND WEST SUSSEX (8.9%) AND LOWEST IN LEICESTERSHIRE, RUTLAND AND NORTHAMPTONSHIRE (2.0%). SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS WERE FOUND AT MULTIVARIABLE ANALYSIS BETWEEN THE PROPORTION OF INFECTION AND THE NUMBER OF ANIMALS SENT TO SLAUGHTER (BETA = -0.005; 95%CI = - 0.005, - 0.004), SOIL TEXTURE (PEAT COMPARED TO COARSE TEXTURED SOILS; BETA = - 0.516; 95%CI = -1.010, - 0.063), RELATIVE HUMIDITY (BETA = 0.011; 95%CI = 0.006, 0.015), MEAN TEMPERATURE (BETA = 0.007; 95%CI = 0.003, 0.012), AND RAINFALL (BETA = 0.022; 95%CI = 0.004, 0.037).

THE PROPORTIONS REPRESENTED STEPS WHEN 15%, 30%, 45%, 60%, 75% AND 100% OF THE DRAINED PEATLAND IS RESTORED. WE MODELLED THE HABITAT SUITABILITY FOR 48 RED-LISTED PLANT SPECIES IN THE AAPA MIRE REGION IN BOREAL FINLAND. MODEL OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED AT THE LEVEL OF FIVE SPECIES GROUPS: CALCAREOUS SPECIES, RICH FEN SPECIES, DECAYING WOOD SPECIES, MESOTROPHIC FEN SPECIES, AND SPRUCE SWAMP SPECIES. THE PREDICTED DISTRIBUTION INCREASED FOR 34 (71%) OF THE 48 RED LISTED PLANT SPECIES WHEN 15% OF DRAINED PEATLAND AREA WAS PREDICTED TO BE RESTORED. AT THE SAME TIME THE POTENTIALLY OCCUPIED AREA OF SPECIES INCREASED BY 9%. IN THE SCENARIO WHERE ALL PEATLANDS WERE RESTORED, THE PREDICTED DISTRIBUTION OF 43 (90%) OF SPECIES INCREASED, AND ON AVERAGE THE DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIES QUADRUPLED. ACCORDING TO OUR PREDICTIONS, MEETING THE 15% ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION TARGET, SET IN THE PREVIOUS CBD AND EU BIODIVERSITY STRATEGY TARGETS WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR MOST OF THE BOREAL RED-LISTED MIRE PLANT SPECIES, BUT A LARGER RESTORATION AREA WOULD EXPAND THEIR DISTRIBUTION CONSIDERABLY MORE.

THE STUDY SHOWS THAT THE MIRE LIES IN ITS OWN BASIN WHILE BEING PART OF A COMPLEX MIRE SYSTEM.

THE REGION HAS A WIDE VARIETY OF PEATLANDS WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THEIR BIOGEOCHEMICAL, GEOMORPHOLOGICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS INTO DIFFERENT TYPES OF BOGS AND FENS. 2. MOST OF THE PEATLANDS OCCUR IN THE ATLANTIC REGION FOLLOWED BY THE MEDITERRANEAN AND ALPINE REGIONS.

PEATLAND RECOVERY IS OFTEN MONITORED SHORTLY AFTER RESTORATION, BUT INITIAL TRENDS MAY NOT CONTINUE, AND RESULTS MIGHT DIFFER AMONG TAXONOMIC GROUPS. THIS STUDY ANALYZES TRENDS IN PLANT, DRAGONFLY, AND BUTTERFLY DIVERSITY WITHIN 18 YEARS AFTER REWETTING OF MONTANE PEATLANDS IN CENTRAL GERMANY. WE COMPARED DIVERSITY AND SPECIES COMPOSITION OF 19 RESTORED SITES WITH THREE DRAINED PEATLANDS AND ONE NEAR-NATURAL REFERENCE SITE. RESTORATION RESULTED IN IMPROVED HABITAT CONDITIONS AND BENEFITED SPECIES DIVERSITY, BUT THERE WERE MARKED DIFFERENCES AMONG TAXONOMIC GROUPS. DRAGONFLIES RAPIDLY COLONIZED SMALL WATER BODIES BUT THEIR DIVERSITY DID NOT FURTHER INCREASE IN OLDER RESTORATION SITES. CHARACTERISTIC PEATLAND VEGETATION RECOVERED SLOWLY, SINCE IT DEPENDED ON A HIGH WATER HOLDING CAPACITY THAT WAS ONLY REACHED AFTER PEAT STARTED ACCUMULATING. GENERALLY, PLANT DIVERSITY DEVELOPED TOWARD REFERENCE CONDITIONS ALBEIT INCOMPLETELY, EVEN 18 YEARS AFTER RESTORATION. BUTTERFLIES RESPONDED LESS TO PEATLAND RESTORATION; GENERALISTS INCREASED ONLY TEMPORARILY AND SPECIALISTS COULD NOT ESTABLISH. IN CONCLUSION, PEATLAND RESTORATION IMPROVES HABITAT CONDITIONS AND BIODIVERSITY, WHILE TRAJECTORIES OF RECOVERY ARE NONLINEAR AND INCOMPLETE AFTER TWO DECADES.

AIMS: TO IDENTIFY ENVIRONMENTAL CORRELATES OF CURLEW BREEDING DISTRIBUTION, NESTING SUCCESS AND CHANGE IN DISTRIBUTION. METHODS: THIRTY RANDOM 1 KM SQUARES STRATIFIED BY HISTORICAL POPULATION TREND WERE SURVEYED FOR CURLEW DENSITY AND NESTING SUCCESS, AND HABITAT-AND PREDATION-RELATED VARIABLES IN A LANDSCAPE CONTAINING AGRICULTURALLY IMPROVED FARMLAND, AND MOORLAND THAT WAS PARTLY PROTECTED AND SUBJECT TO GRAZING REDUCTIONS FOR NATURE CONSERVATION. ANALYSES TESTED FOR ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CURLEW MEASURES AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES.

THE DRILL TEST HAS BEEN USED TO ASSESS CHANGES IN LAYERING AND THICKNESS OF THE FEN SOILS. THE FOLLOWING SOIL PARAMETERS, SUCH AS PH AND TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON CONTENT, WERE DETERMINED AT EACH DISTINGUISH LAYER. THE DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTION PATTERN OF SOIL MICROARTHROPODS, REPRESENTED BY COLLEMBOLA, WAS EXAMINED IN TWO PARTS OF THE FEN: RESTORED AND NOT-RESTORED. THE SOIL PARAMETERS, SUCH AS PH, ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY, TOTAL EXCHANGEABLE BASE, TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON, AND NITROGEN CONTENT, WERE DETERMINED IN THE SOIL SAMPLES SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE ASSESSMENT OF THE VEGETATION STRUCTURE RECOVERY WITHIN STUDIED MOUNTAIN FEN AFTER LANDSLIDE WAS REFERRED TO AVERAGE PARAMETERS OF THE COMMUNITY COMPLETED FOR OTHER NATURAL MOUNTAIN FENS UNDER THE CALTHO-ALNETUM COMMUNITY.

THE GRADUAL RISE IN WATER LEVELS IN THE MIRES THAT STARTED IN THE SUBBOREAL PERIOD AND INTENSIFIED DURING THE SUBATLANTIC PERIOD WAS RECORDED AS A SLOW SHIFT IN VEGETATION TOWARDS NON-FOREST, SEDGE-MOSS COMMUNITIES BELONGING TO THE MAGNOCARICION ALLIANCE OR THE SCHEUCHZERIO-CARICETEA NIGRAE CLASS. ONE CONSEQUENCE OF THE MECHANISM OF HSDP FORMATION IS THE EXISTENCE OF LIMITATIONS ON THE DATING OF THE DURATION OF THE DRY PHASE OWING TO THE PRESENCE OF ORGANIC MATTER OF DIFFERENT AGES IN THE DEGRADED PEAT LAYER. THE DETERMINATION OF THE AGE OF WET PHASES OFFERS BETTER PROSPECTS.

THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND DROUGHT EFFECTS ON VEGETATION DEVELOPMENT AND THE EXCHANGE OF THE TWO IMPORTANT GREENHOUSE GASES CO2 AND CH4, ESPECIALLY IN REWETTED FENS. BASED ON LONG-TERM REFERENCE RECORDS, WE INVESTIGATED ANOMALIES IN VEGETATION DYNAMICS, CH4 EMISSIONS, AND NET CO2 EXCHANGE, INCLUDING THE COMPONENT FLUXES OF ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION (R-ECO) AND GROSS ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY (GEP), IN A REWETTED FEN DURING THE EXTREME EUROPEAN SUMMER DROUGHT IN 2018. DROUGHT-INDUCED VEGETATION DYNAMICS WERE DERIVED FROM REMOTELY SENSED DATA. SINCE FLOODING IN 2010, THE FEN WAS CHARACTERIZED BY A PATCHY MOSAIC OF OPEN-WATER SURFACES AND VEGETATED AREAS. AFTER YEARS OF STAGNANT VEGETATION DEVELOPMENT, DROUGHT ACTED AS A TRIGGER EVENT FOR PIONEER SPECIES SUCH AS TEPHROSERIS PALUSTRIS AND RANUNCULUS SCELERATUS TO RAPIDLY CLOSE PERSISTENT VEGETATION GAPS. THE MASSIVE SPREAD OF VEGETATION ASSIMILATED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF CO2. IN 2018, THE ANNUAL GEP BUDGET INCREASED BY 20 % IN COMPARISON TO AVERAGE YEARS (2010-2017). R-ECO INCREASED EVEN BY 40 %, BUT ENHANCED PHOTOSYNTHETIC CO2 SEQUESTRATION COULD COMPENSATE FOR HALF OF THE DROUGHT-INDUCED INCREASE IN RESPIRATORY CO2 RELEASE. ALTOGETHER, THE RESTORED FEN REMAINED A NET CO2 SINK IN THE YEAR OF DROUGHT, THOUGH NET CO2 SEQUESTRATION WAS LOWER THAN IN OTHER YEARS. CH4 EMISSIONS WERE 20 % BELOW AVERAGE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, THOUGH STRONGER REDUCTION EFFECTS OCCURRED FROM AUGUST ONWARDS, WHEN DAILY FLUXES WERE 60 % LOWER THAN IN REFERENCE YEARS. OUR STUDY REVEALS AN IMPORTANT REGULATORY MECHANISM OF RESTORED FENS TO MAINTAIN THEIR NET CO2 SINK FUNCTION EVEN IN EXTREMELY DRY YEARS.

WATERS DRAINING SUCH DEGRADED PEATLANDS ARE LIKELY TO HAVE INCREASED LEVELS OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC) AND OTHER NUTRIENTS, WHICH CAN ADVERSELY IMPACT THE GLOBAL CLIMATE, DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES AND FRESHWATER ECOLOGY. CONSEQUENTLY PEATLAND REVEGETATION EFFORTS HAVE BECOME WIDESPREAD. THIS PAPER PRESENTS RESULTS FROM A FOUR-YEAR STUDY CONDUCTED TO MONITOR THE WATER QUALITY IMPACTS OF A BARE PEAT REVEGETATION APPROACH, WHICH USED LANDSCAPE SCALE APPLICATION OF LIME AND FERTILISER TO ENCOURAGE A GRASS NURSE CROP. THIS STUDY CONSIDERS AN AREA OF SEVERELY DEGRADED BLANKET PEAT IN THE UK UPLANDS, WITH LARGE AREAS OF BARE PEAT PRIOR TO REVEGETATION AND PROVIDES THE LARGEST FIELD DATASET TO DATE ON THE EFFECTS OF THIS METHOD ON CATCHMENT RUN-OFF WATERS.

RESULTS WE FOUND THAT CLIMATIC AND WATER QUALITY VARIABLES WERE ALMOST EQUALLY IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING SPECIES COMPOSITION IN SUBARCTIC SPRINGS, WITH CLIMATIC VARIABLES EXPLAINING 26.62% OF VARIATION IN SPECIES COMPOSITION AND WATER QUALITY VARIABLES EXPLAINING 26.14%. SPATIAL VARIABLES EXPLAINED THE LEAST VARIATION (21.53%). WHEN LOOKING AT THE VARIABLES INDIVIDUALLY, ALTITUDE (10.93%) AND MEAN SUMMER TEMPERATURE (9.25%) EXPLAINED THE MOST VARIATION.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF NUTRIENTS AND ORGANIC CARBON ON THE RELATIVE PROPORTION OF PRIMARY PRODUCERS (MICROALGAE) AND HETEROTROPHIC DECOMPOSERS (BACTERIA AND FUNGI) DURING AQUATIC BIOFILM DEVELOPMENT IN A BOREAL PEATLAND. GIVEN THAT DECOMPOSERS ARE OFTEN BETTER COMPETITORS FOR NUTRIENTS THAN PRIMARY PRODUCERS IN AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS, WE PREDICTED THAT LABILE CARBON SUBSIDIES WOULD SHIFT THE BIOFILM COMPOSITION TOWARDS HETEROTROPHY OWING TO THE ABILITY OF DECOMPOSERS TO OUTCOMPETE PRIMARY PRODUCERS FOR AVAILABLE NUTRIENTS IN THE ABSENCE OF CARBON LIMITATION. WE MANIPULATED NUTRIENTS (NITRATE AND PHOSPHATE) AND ORGANIC CARBON (GLUCOSE) IN A FULL FACTORIAL DESIGN USING NUTRIENT-DIFFUSING SUBSTRATES IN AN ALASKAN FEN. HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIA WERE LIMITED BY ORGANIC CARBON AND ALGAE WERE LIMITED BY INORGANIC NUTRIENTS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOMES OF COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS DEPENDED ON BACKGROUND NUTRIENT LEVELS.

FUNGAL BIOMASS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE PRESENCE OF GLUCOSE ALONE, POSSIBLY OWING TO ANTAGONISTIC INTERACTIONS WITH HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIA. IN CONTRAST TO BACTERIA, FUNGI WERE STIMULATED ALONG WITH ALGAE FOLLOWING NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT. THE DECOUPLING OF ALGAE AND HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIA IN THE PRESENCE OF GLUCOSE ALONE SHIFTED THE BIOFILM TROPHIC STATUS TOWARDS HETEROTROPHY.

THE SAMPLES WERE HEATED UP TO 900 DEGREES C WITH DIFFERENT HEATING RATES OF 10, 15, AND 20 DEGREES C/MIN. THEREAFTER, PYROLYSIS EXPERIMENTS WITH PEAK TEMPERATURES OF 450, 500, 550 AND 600 DEGREES C WERE PERFORMED IN A BENCH-SCALE PYROLYZER. IT WAS FOUND THAT THERE ARE FOUR MAIN STAGES AND TWO MICRO STAGES OF MASS LOSS DURING PEAT MOSS PYROLYSIS FROM ROOM TEMPERATURE TO 900 DEGREES C. ALSO, KINETIC PARAMETERS WERE CALCULATED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF TG AND DTG BY THE KISSINGER-AKAHIRA-SUNOSE (KAS) METHOD AND THE COATS-REDFERN (CR) METHOD. IN THE BENCH-SCALE PYROLYSIS EXPERIMENTS, FOUR PHASES, I.E., CHAR, TAR, AQUEOUS PHASE, AND GAS, WERE OBTAINED AND CHARACTERIZED. THE CARBON DISTRIBUTION AND THE GHG EMISSION FROM PEAT MOSS PYROLYSIS WERE DETERMINED.","PYROLYSIS PERFORMANCE OF PEAT MOSS: A SIMULTANEOUS IN-SITU THERMAL ANALYSIS AND BENCH-SCALE EXPERIMENTAL STUDY","FUEL","ARTICLE","OCT 1",2020,"10.1016/j.fuel.2020.118173","ENERGY & FUELS; ENGINEERING, CHEMICAL","WOS:000541255200060"

LOCATION: WEST AND FUEGIAN PATAGONIA, AND THE FALKLAND ISLANDS (ISLAS MALVINAS), SOUTHERN SOUTH AMERICA. METHODS: DNA SEQUENCE DATA FROM SEVEN AND FOURTEEN, RESPECTIVELY, NUCLEAR LOCI CONTAINING SIMPLE SEQUENCE REPEATS OF 371 AND 328 INDIVIDUALS OF THE TWO STUDY SPECIES WERE ANALYSED USING POPULATION GENETIC SUMMARY STATISTICS, PHYLOGENETIC NETWORKS AND BAYESIAN AND MULTIVARIATE METHODS TO DETERMINE GENETIC STRUCTURE. ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELLING WAS USED TO RECONSTRUCT THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF SUITABLE HABITAT AT THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM. RESULTS: ALL A. PUMILA POPULATIONS BELONG TO A SINGLE POPULATION GENETIC CLUSTER. IN THE CASE OF D. FASCICULARIS, ONLY THE NORTHERNMOST SAMPLED POPULATION FROM NAHUELBUTA (CHILE) IS GENETICALLY DISTINCT, WHEREAS THE REMAINDER FORMS A CLUSTER WITHOUT MUCH FURTHER SUBSTRUCTURE. ACCORDING TO PALAEODISTRIBUTION MODELS, SOUTH-CENTRAL CHILE OFFERED SUITABLE HABITAT DURING THE LAST GLACIAL. MAIN CONCLUSION: BOTH ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELLING AND THE VERY LOW GENETIC SUBDIFFERENTIATION ARE CONGRUENT WITH A TABULA RASA SCENARIO FOR THE PATAGONIAN CHANNELS.

NATURAL ARCHIVES OF PALEO-TYPHOON VARIABILITY CAN BE USED TO ASSESS HOW CHANGES IN THE PLANETARY CLIMATIC SYSTEM DURING THE HOLOCENE COULD INFLUENCE TC FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY IN THIS PART OF PACIFIC. EXTREME TYPHOON-RELATED RAINS ARE THE MAIN CAUSE OF CATASTROPHIC FLOODS ON SAKHALIN ISLAND AND DEPOSITS OF THESE FLOODS ARE EVIDENCE OF PALEO-TYPHOON. THE PALEO-TYPHOONS THAT TRIGGERED EXTREME FLOODS ON SOUTHERN SAKHALIN DURING THE LAST 6.6 KYR ARE RECORDED IN THE SEQUENCE ON THE INTERFLUVIAL SURFACE IN THE NORTHERN SUSUNAY LOWLAND (NAIBA RIVER BASIN). THE SEQUENCE INCLUDES PEAT BOG WITH NUMEROUS LOAM INTERLAYERS DEPOSITED DURING EXTREME FLOODS INUNDATING THE BOG.

THE FREQUENCY OF EXTREME TYPHOONS INCREASED BOTH DURING WARM (WET AND DRY) PHASES AND IN COLD DRY PHASES OF THE CLIMATE FLUCTUATIONS.

COAL DEPOSITS ARE BECOMING IMPORTANT SOURCES OF MANY STRATEGIC METAL RESOURCES. HOWEVER, ORE DEPOSIT THEORY STUDY FOR COAL-METAL RESOURCES HAS NOT BEEN SYSTEMATIC. THIS PAPER SUMMARIZES THE MINERALIZATION CHARACTERISTICS OF GERMANIUM, GALLIUM, LITHIUM, AND REES IN COAL ON THE BASIS OF PREVIOUS RESEARCH RESULTS AND FIELD INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE ON SEVEN METALLOGENIC ZONES OF COAL METAL DEPOSITS IN CHINA. COAL-GERMANIUM DEPOSITS, PRODUCTS OF MAGMATIC HYDROTHERMAL ACTIVITY, MAINLY OCCUR IN LOW RANK COAL IN THE AREAS OF ERLIAN, THE HAILAER BASIN, INNER MONGOLIA, AND THE SANJIANG DISTRICT IN THE YUNNAN PROVINCE. OCCASIONALLY, RICH-GERMANIUM-COAL CAN BE FOUND IN OTHER AREAS. COAL-GALLIUM DEPOSITS ARE MAINLY IN THE PERMIAN COAL OF NORTH CHINA, JURASSIC COAL OF NORTHWEST CHINA, AND LATE-PERMIAN COAL OF SOUTH CHINA. THE ACCUMULATION OF GALLIUM IN COAL IS CLOSELY RELATED TO ALUMINUM-CONTAINING MINERALS. COAL-LITHIUM DEPOSITS MAINLY OCCUR IN THE ZHUNGEER COAL FIELD, INNER MONGOLIA, THE PINGSHUO COAL FIELD, AND THE JINGCHENG COAL FIELD IN THE SHANXI PROVINCE, AND SOME COAL FIELDS IN SOUTH CHINA. SIMILARLY TO GALLIUM, THE ACCUMULATION OF LITHIUM IN COAL IS ALSO CLOSELY RELATED TO ALUMINUM-CONTAINING MINERALS. COAL-REE DEPOSITS MAINLY OCCUR IN THE EARLY JURASSIC COAL OF THE ERLIAN BASIN AND INNER MONGOLIA, AND LATE PERMIAN COAL IN SOUTH CHINA. REES OF ERLIAN BASIN COAL LIKELY ENTERED IN IONIC FORMS IN EARLY STAGES OF COAL OR PEAT BOG FORMATION. REES OF SOUTH CHINA COAL ARE LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH REE-RICH TRASS VOLCANIC ASH WHICH DEPOSITED SYNCHRONOUSLY WITH PEAT BOG ACCUMULATION. ABUNDANT ABNORMAL METAL ELEMENTS IN COAL ARE IMPORTANT FOR CLASSIFICATION OF METALLOGENIC ZONES. REGIONAL TECTONIC BACKGROUND AND EVOLUTION, CHARACTERISTICS OF STRATIGRAPHIC SEDIMENTARY ENVIRONMENT, AND COAL QUALITY ARE ALSO IMPORTANT FACTORS. (1) DELINEATION OF GERMANIUM METALLOGENIC ZONES IN THE COAL FOLLOWS THE PRINCIPLES THAT: COAL IN THE COAL AREA SHOULD BE LOW-METAMORPHIC BITUMINOUS (LONG-FLAME) COAL; THE BASEMENT OF THE COAL-BEARING BASIN WAS BROKEN AND FAULTS DEVELOPED IN THE REGION; AND THERE ARE OBVIOUS TRACES OF HYDROTHERMAL INTRUSION IN OR AROUND THE COAL MEASURES IN THE ZONE. (2) DELINEATION OF GALLIUM METALLOGENIC ZONES IN COAL IS BASED ON THESE TRAITS: AN OBVIOUS GALLIUM SOURCE SHOULD EXIST IN THE REGION; THE PROVENANCE AREA HAS FAVORABLE WEATHERING AND DENUDATION CONDITIONS; AND AN ALUMINUM-GALLIUM FORMATION UNDER STRONG LEACHING IS CONTAINED WITHIN. (3) DELINEATION OF LITHIUM METALLOGENIC ZONES IN COAL REQUIRES: RELATIVELY CLEAR SOURCES OF LITHIUM IN THE ZONES; FAVORABLE WEATHERING AND DENUDATION CONDITIONS IN THE PROVENANCE AREA; AND ALUMINUM-LITHIUM CONTAINING ROCKS UNDER STRONG LEACHING. (4) DELINEATION OF RARE EARTH MINERALIZATION ZONES IN COAL IS BASED ON: LARGE SCALE VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS IN OR NEAR PEAT BOGS DURING THE ACCUMULATION PERIOD, WITH TUFF IN THE COAL-BEARING STRATA; AND HYDROTHERMAL INTRUSION INTO COAL-MEASURE STRATA DURING THE PEAT BOG PERIOD OR EARLY COAL-FORMING PERIOD.

DESPITE THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF HS FRACTIONS, THE DECISIVE FACTOR IN THE EFFICIENCY OF DNA ISOLATION FROM SOIL SAMPLES WAS THE TOTAL CARBON CONTENT IN HS.

WE SELECTED THREE STUDY SITES, EACH REPRESENTING A DIFFERENT STATE OF PEAT DEGRADATION (NATURAL, DEGRADED AND EXTREMELY DEGRADED).

THE SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY (KS), SOIL WATER RETENTION CURVES, TOTAL POROSITY, MACROPOROSITY (PORE DIAMETER >30 MU M), BULK DENSITY AND SOIL ORGANIC MATTER CONTENT (SOM) WERE DETERMINED FOR ALL SAMPLING LOCATIONS. THE VAN GENUCHTEN (VG) MODEL PARAMETERS (THETA(S), ALPHA, AND N) WERE OPTIMIZED USING THE RETC SOFTWARE PACKAGE.

HOWEVER, THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MACROPOROSITY AND KS DIFFERED BETWEEN THE NATURAL AND THE DRAINED PEATLANDS.

THE GEOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE SPATIAL DEPENDENCE OF SOIL HYDRO-PHYSICAL PROPERTIES VARIES DEPENDING ON THE CONSIDERED PROPERTY AS WELL AS LAND MANAGEMENT (E.G. DRAINAGE). BULK DENSITY AND SOM ARE SPATIALLY DEPENDENT, WHEREAS K-S AND MACROPOROSITY ARE SPATIALLY INDEPENDENT IF THE PEAT IS SEVERELY DEGRADED.

WE INVESTIGATED THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MIXED SUBSTRATES, I.E., PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION, CONTAINER CAPACITY, AIR SPACE, TOTAL POROSITY, BULK DENSITY, AND THE MOISTURE RETENTION CURVE; AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES, I.E., PH, ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY, AND NUTRIENT CONTENT. LARGE PARTICLES (1.4-5.6 MM IN DIAMETER) INCREASED AS THE RATIO OF CBA INCREASED, WHILE SMALL PARTICLES (< 710 MU M IN DIAMETER) INCREASED AS THE RATIO OF COIR DUST INCREASED. AS THE RATIO OF FBA INCREASED, SMALL PARTICLES (< 106 MU M) INCREASED. AS CBA INCREASED, THE CONTAINER CAPACITY DECREASED BUT AIR SPACES INCREASED, WHILE INCREASING FBA REDUCED THE AIR SPACES IN THE SUBSTRATE MIX. IN 100% FBA MEDIUM, THE MAXIMUM CONTAINER CAPACITY WAS LOW (32.5%), AND HAD VERY LOW EASILY AVAILABLE WATER (BELOW 2%); THIS SUGGESTS THAT, ON ITS OWN, FBA HAS POOR POTENTIAL FOR USE AS A HORTICULTURAL MEDIUM. IN SUBSTRATE MIXES OF ACIDIC COIR DUST (PH 4.99) AND CBA, INCREASING THE PROPORTION OF BOTTOM ASH GRADUALLY INCREASED THE PH, WHICH IS SIMILAR TO PERLITE. ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY OF THE SUBSTRATE INCREASED AS THE RATIO OF FBA IN THE SUBSTRATE MIX INCREASED, LARGELY CAUSED BY THE HIGH CA AND NA CONTENT OF FBA. WHEN THE PROPORTION OF FBA WAS INCREASED IN THE SUBSTRATE MIX BY MORE THAN 30%, CD CONTENTS WERE HIGHER THAN THE ACCEPTABLE LEVEL FOR USE IN HORTICULTURE. OTHER HEAVY METALS (AS, PB, CR, CU, NI, AND ZN) WERE DETECTED AT LOW CONCENTRATIONS IN ALL SUBSTRATE MIXES, BUT WITHIN THE ACCEPTABLE RANGE FOR USE IN HORTICULTURAL MEDIA.

BASE ON THE PROPERTIES AND DEPOSITIONAL RATES (LI ET AL., 2019) OF JC1 (50-CM LONG) AND JCA (92-CM LONG), CARBON ACCUMULATION RATES (RCAS) HAVE BEEN CALCULATED FOR DIFFERENT PERIODS AND PROCESSES OF PEATLAND DEVELOPMENT OVER THE PAST 1000 YEARS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED. THE LONG TERM VARIATIONS OF THE RCAS BETWEEN JINCHUAN MIRE AND NEARBY BAIJIANGHE MIRE (XIA ET AL., 2019) DURING THE PAST 1000 YEARS MATCHED REASONABLY WELL, REFLECTING SIMILAR CARBON ACCUMULATION RATES UNDER THE SAME CLIMATIC CONTROL EVEN THOUGH THE PLANT SPECIES COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT IN THE TWO MIRES. ENHANCED DETRITAL CONTENT CAUSED BY SURFACE RUNOFF DUE TO HEAVY RAINS WITH DECLINE OF WOOD% IN PLANT REMAINS PROBABLY REFLECT WET CLIMATES; AND VICE VERSA. IN COMPARISONS WITH REGIONAL CLIMATIC RECORDS, WE DESCRIBE THE DEVELOPMENT OF JINCHUAN MIRE AS FOLLOW: (1) RELATIVELY WARM AND WET CLIMATES BETWEEN 1000 CE AND 1150 CE REFLECTED BY DOMINANT HERB SPECIES (> 95%) WITH LOW WOOD% AND NO SPHAGNUM%, LOW DBD AND DETRITUS, AND HIGH TOC% AND POROSITY. A DRY CLIMATE OCCURRED DURING 1150-1200 CE TO LOWER THE WATER TABLE AND ENABLE GROWTH OF MOSSES IN THE MIRE. (2) WET AND COOLING CONDITIONS DURING 1200-1370 CE SUPPORTED WELL DEVELOPMENT OF SPHAGNUM MOSSES AND GOOD DEVELOPMENT OF THE MIRE. (3) A CLIMATIC CHANGE FROM WET/COOL TO COLD/DRY BETWEEN 1370 CE AND 1440 CE CAUSED DISAPPEAR OF SPHAGNUM MOSSES.

GROUND PENETRATING RADAR (GPR), A RAPID TECHNIQUE FOR FIELD DATA COLLECTION, HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY DEMONSTRATED AS AN APPROPRIATE METHOD OF MAPPING PEAT THICKNESS. LIGHT DETECTION AND RANGING (LIDAR) DATA AS A METHOD FOR UNDERSTANDING PEATLAND SURFACE ELEVATION ARE ALSO BECOMING MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE. RELIABLE MAPPING AND QUANTIFICATION OF SITE-SPECIFIC CARBON STOCKS (E.G. UPLAND RAISED BOGS) IS THEREFORE, BECOMING INCREASINGLY FEASIBLE, PROVIDING A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO REGIONAL, NATIONAL AND POTENTIALLY GLOBAL CARBON STOCK ASSESSMENTS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE RAISED BOGS, SUCH AS THOSE FOUND IN SOUTH WALES ARE CONSIDERABLE CARBON STORES. THEY ARE, HOWEVER, SUSCEPTIBLE TO CLIMATE WARMING OWING TO THEIR SOUTHERLY LOCATION WITHIN THE UK. ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF PEATLAND CARBON STOCKS HAS BROADER IMPORTANCE BECAUSE WORLD-WIDE PEATLAND CARBON STORES ARE SIGNIFICANT AND THREATENED BY CLIMATE CHANGE, POSING A SUBSTANTIAL CHALLENGE NOT ONLY DUE TO CLIMATE FEEDBACKS IF THIS STORED CARBON IS RELEASED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE, BUT ALSO THE IMPACT ON THE OTHER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE. HERE, WE ASSESS THE VALUE OF AN INTEGRATED GPR, LIDAR AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) APPROACH TO IMPROVE ESTIMATION OF REGIONAL CARBON STOCKS. WE APPLY THE APPROACH TO THREE OMBROTROPHIC RAISED BOGS IN SOUTH WALES, UK, SELECTED FOR THEIR CONSERVATION VALUE AND THEIR TOPOGRAPHICALLY-CONFINED RAISED BOG FORM. GPR AND LIDAR ARE FOUND TO BE WELL SUITED, RESPECTIVELY, TO MAPPING PEAT THICKNESS AT BOG SCALE AND SURFACE ELEVATION, THUS ALLOWING SURFACE AND BASAL TOPOGRAPHIES TO BE EVALUATED USING GIS. IN TURN, THIS ALLOWS PEAT VOLUMES TO BE ESTIMATED. FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE RECORD VALUES BETWEEN 55,200 M(3) AND 163,000 M(3) FOR THE SITES CONSIDERED HERE. THE GREATER CONFIDENCE IN THESE PEAT VOLUME ESTIMATES RESULTS FROM THE ABILITY TO CALIBRATE THE GPR VELOCITY USING A DEPTH-TO-TARGET CALIBRATION WITH PEAT CORES EXTRACTED AT LOCATIONS ENCOMPASSING THE DEEPEST BOG AREA. PEAT THICKNESS IS MAPPED AT THE BOG SCALE WITH NEAR CENTIMETRE PRECISION, IMPROVING THE ROBUSTNESS OF SUBSEQUENT VOLUME CALCULATIONS AND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF THESE SMALL BUT NUMEROUS SITES TO REGIONAL CARBON STOCKS. OUR EVALUATION SHOWS THAT GPR CORRESPONDS WELL WITH CONVENTIONAL MANUAL PROBING BUT IS MINIMALLY INVASIVE AND THEREFORE LESS DISTURBING OF SENSITIVE PEATLAND SITES, WHILE ALSO OFFERING IMPROVED COVERAGE AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION WITH LESS TIME AND COST. IN COMBINATION WITH MEASURED BULK DENSITY AND ORGANIC CARBON CONTENTS, THESE PEAT VOLUMES ALLOW CARBON STOCKS TO BE ESTIMATED WITH GREATER CONFIDENCE COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL APROACHES, HAVING VALUES BETWEEN 2181 +/- 122 TONNES CARBON AND 6305 +/- 351 TONNES CARBON AT OUR THREE SITES.","AN INTEGRATED GEOPHYSICAL AND GIS BASED APPROACH IMPROVES ESTIMATION OF PEATLAND CARBON STOCKS","GEODERMA","ARTICLE","NOV 15",2021,"10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115176","SOIL SCIENCE","WOS:000670660600004"

THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THE POINTS IN THE TRANSECT, AS WELL AS THE INTERVAL BETWEEN TRANSECTS, WAS 3 METERS. THE TOTAL AREA OF THE POLYGON WAS 1,134 M(2). THE TREE SPECIES GROWING WITHIN THE POLYGON WERE QUERCUS ROBUR, SOPHORA JAPONICA, AND ACER CAMPESTRE. SHRUBS WERE REPRESENTED BY ULMUS LAEVIS, TILIA CORDATA, CELTIS OCCIDENTALIS, AND MORUS NIGRA. THE LOCATIONS OF THE TREES AND SHRUBS WERE MAPPED. THE CROWNS OF TREE AND SHRUB PLANTS FORMED A DENSE CANOPY AND A SHADY LIGHT REGIME. THE GRASS COVER WAS PRACTICALLY ABSENT. THE SOIL MECHANICAL RESISTANCE, SOIL AGGREGATE-SIZE DISTRIBUTION, ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY OF SOIL, SOIL MOISTURE AND BULK DENSITY WERE MEASURED. WE RECORDED 618 INDIVIDUALS OF VALLONIA PULCHELLA, 120 INDIVIDUALS OF COCHLICOPA LUBRICA, AND 58 INDIVIDUALS OF ACANTHINULA ACULEATA WITHIN THE SURVEYED POLYGON. WE EXTRACTED THREE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS, WHICH COULD EXPLAIN 60.9% OF THE VARIATION IN THE FEATURE SPACE OF THE SOIL PROPERTIES. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT 1 EXPLAINED 42.0% OF THE VARIATION OF THE FEATURE SPACE AND DEPENDED ON THE SOIL PENETRATION RESISTANCE THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE PROFILE, AGGREGATE COMPOSITION, DENSITY, ELECTRIC CONDUCTIVITY AND MOISTURE CONTENT OF SOIL. THIS COMPONENT REFLECTED A TENDENCY FOR SOIL PENETRATION RESISTANCE AND SOIL DENSITY TO INCREASE NEAR RECREATIONAL TRAILS. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT 1 WAS USED TO INDICATE THE GRADIENT OF RECREATIONAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE SOIL. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT 2 WAS ABLE TO EXPLAIN 10.6% OF THE VARIATION IN THE FEATURE SPACE. IT NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE DISTANCE FROM THE RECREATIONAL TRAIL, SOIL PENETRATION RESISTANCE AT THE DEPTH OF 35 CM OR MORE, SOIL ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY, AND THE PROPORTION OF AGGREGATES GREATER THAN 3 MM IN SIZE. THIS COMPONENT POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH SOIL PENETRATION RESISTANCE AT 0-5 CM DEPTH AND THE PROPORTION OF AGGREGATES LESS THAN 0.5 MM IN SIZE. THIS COMPONENT CAN BE INTERPRETED AS A ""HALO"" FROM THE RECREATIONAL TRAIL, OR A GRADIENT OF INDIRECT SOIL TRANSFORMATIONS ADJACENT TO THE ZONE OF INTENSE RECREATIONAL LOAD. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT 3 WAS ABLE TO EXPLAIN 8.3% OF THE VARIATION IN THE FEATURE SPACE. IT POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH SOIL PENETRATION RESISTANCE AT THE DEPTH OF 20-40 CM, THE PROPORTION OF 0.5-7.0 MM AGGREGATES, AND SOIL MOISTURE. IT NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE PROPORTION OF AGGREGATES LARGER THAN 7 MM AND SMALLER THAN 0.25 MM. THIS COMPONENT INDICATED A VARIATION IN SOIL PROPERTIES THAT WAS INDUCED BY CAUSES INDEPENDENT OF RECREATIONAL EXPOSURE. THE EXTRACTED GRADIENTS OF SOIL PROPERTIES SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED THE ABUNDANCE OF MICROMOLLUSC POPULATIONS. THE ABUNDANCE OF ALL SPECIES DECREASED AFTER INCREASE IN RECREATIONAL LOAD.

THIS MIRE CONSISTS OF A COMPLEX OF VALLEY-BOTTOM AND SEEPAGE WETLANDS WITH SMALL ELEVATED PEAT DOMES. THE OCCURRENCE OF ONE DECAYING PEAT DOME, WHICH HAS BURNT, AND DESICCATED WETLAND AREAS WITH TERRESTRIAL VEGETATION HAS RAISED CONCERNS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO UNDERSTAND THE MIRE FEATURES AND WATER FLOWS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE POTENTIAL DRIVERS CAUSING WETLAND DEGRADATION. WELLS AND PIEZOMETERS WERE INSTALLED TO MONITOR THE HYDRAULIC HEAD AND COLLECT WATER SAMPLES FOR ANALYSIS OF ION COMPOSITION, O-18 AND H-2 STABLE ISOTOPE CONTENT, AND DELTA C-13 AND C-14 ISOTOPE CONTENT FOR RADIOCARBON DATING. MOREOVER, PEAT TEMPERATURE PROFILES WERE MEASURED AND PEAT DEPOSITS WERE ALSO DATED USING RADIOCARBON. RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE MATLABAS MIRE DEVELOPED IN THE LOWEST CENTRAL-EAST SIDE OF THE VALLEY BY PALUDIFICATION AT THE ONSET OF THE HOLOCENE. DURING THE MID-HOLOCENE, PEAT DEVELOPMENT WAS EXTENDED LATERALLY BY AUTOGENIC AND ALLOGENIC PROCESSES. THREE TYPES OF WATER FLOWS DRIVING PEAT DEVELOPMENT WERE IDENTIFIED - SHEET FLOW, PHREATIC GROUNDWATER FLOW AND DEEP GROUNDWATER FLOW - TWO OF WHICH ARE SURFACE OR NEAR SURFACE FLOWS. THE RECENT OCCURRENCE OF DECAYING PEAT DOMES AND DESICCATED WETLAND AREAS IS POSSIBLY RELATED TO LOSS OF EXFILTRATING DEEP GROUNDWATER FLOWS THAT HAVE RESULTED FROM DRAINAGE BY THE HEAD-CUT CHANNELS IN THE MIRE AND INTERCEPTION OF NEAR SURFACE WATER FLOW BY AN ACCESS ROAD, RESPECTIVELY.

WE TESTED THE POSSIBILITIES FOR APPLYING SUCH STUDIES TO LOW-MOOR BOGS WHICH ARE THE MOST COMMONLY OCCURRING TYPE OF BOG IN THE WORLD. MATERIALS AND METHODS REPRESENTATIVE PEAT SAMPLES WERE TAKEN FROM TWO PROFILES IN A PEATLAND LOCATED IN THE VISTULA VALLEY (SOUTHERN POLAND), AND THEY WERE ANALYSED FOR THE OCCURRENCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF BIOMARKERS. THE DISTRIBUTION OF N-ALKANES WAS DETERMINED USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROMETRY (GC-MS). THE BOTANICAL COMPOSITION OF THE SAMPLES WAS DETERMINED BY ANALYSIS OF PLANT MACROFOSSIL REMAINS, AND THE DEGREE OF PEAT DECOMPOSITION WAS ALSO DETERMINED. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION SAMPLES OF LOW-MOOR PEAT WERE CHARACTERISED BY A PREVALENCE OF MEDIUM- AND LONG-CHAIN N-ALKANE HOMOLOGUES, WHICH IS TYPICAL FOR HIGHER PLANTS. THE VARIABLE VALUES OF THE CPI, CPI ((25-31)), AND THE C-23/C-25 RATIO HAVE PROVIDED INFORMATION ON THE STAGES OF FORMATION OF THE ZAPADZ BOG. THE SOURCE OF N-ALKANE DIFFERENTIATION IS VEGETATION CHANGE RELATED TO PALAEOHYDROLOGICAL DYNAMICS AND PALAEOENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WITHIN THE PEATLAND.

THE UNDERLYING SHALLOW PEAT MANTLE GLEY SOILS HAVE BEEN FORMED ON DIFFERENT GEOLOGICAL ORIGIN (GLACIOLACUSTRINE, GLACIAL, GLACIOFLUVIAL, MARINE) PARENT MATERIALS. THE PEAT MANTLE OVERLYING GLEY SOILS HAS ACCUMULATED IN THE PROCESS OF LANDSCAPE PALUDIFICATION DURING THE POST GLACIAL PERIOD. USING THE ESTONIAN SOIL CLASSIFICATION (ESC), THE PEAT LAYER THICKNESS OF PEATY SOILS IS 10-30 CM AND OF SHALLOW PEAT SOILS, 30-100 CM. THE STUDIED PEATY SOILS MAY BE CHARACTERIZED AS POLYGENETIC SOILS. DEPENDING ON PARENT MATERIAL PROPERTIES (CALCAREOUSNESS, ACIDITY, TEXTURE) AND FEEDING WATER THE PEATY SOILS ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO TYPES SPECIFIED BY ESC AS PEATY GLEY SOILS AND PEATY PODZOLS, AND BY WRB AS HISTIC GLEYSOLS AND HISTIC PODZOLS. THE MINERAL SOILS UNDERLYING PEAT SOILS MAY BE DEFINED AS PALEOSOLS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH SOILS HAS PROCEEDED ACCORDING TO THE CHRONOSEQUENCE: GLEY SOILS OR PROTOSOLS -> PEATY SOILS -> FEN SOILS -> TRANSITIONAL BOG SOILS -> BOG SOILS, WHEREAS MINERAL PALEOSOLS MAY BE FOUND UNDER FEN, TRANSITIONAL BOG AND BOG SOILS.

AS SHOWN, THE COMPOSITION OF LIPIDS IN WATERS IS EXPOSED TO SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS AND FORMED DUE TO COMPOUNDS GENERATED IN A PEAT DEPOSIT AND FALLING WITH ATMOSPHERIC PRECIPITATION, AND ALSO TO COMPONENTS OF PLANTS. LIPID CONTENT IS LINKED TO LEVEL DYNAMICS OF WATERS, THE QUANTITY OF FALLEN ATMOSPHERIC PRECIPITATION, AND AIR TEMPERATURE. THE AMOUNT OF LIPIDIC COMPONENTS IN WATERS IS MAXIMUM IN THE BEGINNING OF SPRING; THEIR COMPOSITION IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO PEAT COMPOUNDS.

HEREWITH, THE FRACTION OF THE MAIN GROUPS OF LIPIDS: N-ALKANES, AND N-ALDEHYDES, AND ALSO CYCLIC MONO- AND SESQUITERPENOIDS PRESENT IN PLANTS OF THE EARLY GROWING SEASON IN THE SNOW IS INCREASED. AN INCREASE IN AIR TEMPERATURE AND A LOW AMOUNT OF ATMOSPHERIC PRECIPITATION LEAD TO AN INCREASED FRACTION OF LIPIDS PRODUCED BY WATER PLANTS AND COMPOUNDS THAT ARE A PART OF CONIFER RESIN (DEHYDROABIETIC ACID AND ITS DERIVATIVES) IN WATER. WHEN THE AMOUNT OF RAIN PRECIPITATION IS INCREASED, THE DIVERSITY OF COMPOSITION AND LIPID CONTENT ARE REDUCED IN WATER; C-25 AND C-27 N-ALKANES, AND ALSO CARBOXYLIC ACIDS ARE PREVAILING IN THIS CASE.

OVER ALL YEARS AND LOCATIONS, HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FOUND, DESPITE THE 6-18 CM HIGHER GWT IN SUMMER AND 1-20 CM LOWER GWT IN WET CONDITIONS AT SSI SITES. DIFFERENCES IN MEAN ANNUAL GWT REMAINED LOW (< 5 CM). DIRECT COMPARISON OF MEASURED N2O AND CH4 FLUXES BETWEEN SSI AND CONTROL SITES DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES. CO2 FLUXES VARIED ACCORDING TO TEMPERATURE AND MANAGEMENT EVENTS, WHILE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CONTROL AND SSI SITES REMAINED SMALL. THEREFORE, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ANNUAL GAP-FILLED NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE (NEE) OF THE SSI AND CONTROL SITES. THE NET ECOSYSTEM CARBON BALANCE (NECB) WAS ON AVERAGE 40 AND 30 T CO2 HA(-1) YR(-1) IN 2017 AND 2018 ON THE SSI SITES AND 38 AND 34 T CO2 HA(-1) YR(-1 )IN 2017 AND 2018 ON THE CONTROL SITES. THIS LACK OF SSI EFFECT IS PROBABLY BECAUSE THE GWT INCREASE REMAINS LIMITED TO DEEPER SOIL LAYERS (60-120 CM DEPTH), WHICH CONTRIBUTE LITTLE TO PEAT OXIDATION. WE CONCLUDE THAT SSI MODULATES WATER TABLE DYNAMICS BUT FAILS TO LOWER ANNUAL CARBON EMISSION. SSI SEEMS UNSUITABLE AS A CLIMATE MITIGATION STRATEGY.

THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE FIRE IS CURRENTLY OCCUPIED BY A SHRUB-SEDGE-GREEN MOSS-HYPNUM BIRCH FOREST (BETULA PUBESCENS EHRH.) BELONGING TO THE GROUP OF SHORT-TERM-SECONDARY POSTFIRE GRASS FORESTS. THE PYROGENIC PEAT SOILS (I.E., MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL UNDERBURNING) THAT FORMED AS A RESULT OF PASSIVE SMOLDERING (I.E., THERMAL IMPACT BELOW THE IGNITION POINT) FEATURE A HIGH VARIABILITY OF PHYSICOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS (CV = 26-37%). THE APPLICATION OF MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES (CLUSTER, DISCRIMINANT, AND CANONICAL ANALYSIS) HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH AND STATISTICALLY SUBSTANTIATE FOUR CLUSTERS THAT CORRELATE WITH THE SERIES OF PYROGENIC PEAT SOILS. ORGANIC CARBON MAKES THE GREATEST (83%) INPUT INTO THE TOTAL CONTRIBUTION OF CHEMICAL PARAMETERS TO THE DIFFERENTIATION OF CLUSTERS, WHILE THE INPUT OF THE VOLUMETRIC WATER CONTENT IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS (15%). BASED ON THE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF FIRE TRACES IN THE PROFILE OF PYROGENIC PEAT SOILS, THE DISTINGUISHED CLUSTERS HAVE BEEN CONDITIONALLY ASSOCIATED WITH SLIGHT, MODERATE, MEDIUM, AND STRONG THERMAL IMPACTS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS INCUBATION OF HIGH-MOOR PEAT SOILS COLLECTED FROM MARSH VEGETATION AND DWARF BAMBOO WAS CONDUCTED FOR 108 DAYS AT EACH TEMPERATURE OF 25 DEGREES C AND 35 DEGREES C. THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ALKALINE EXTRACT AND DOM IN SOIL SAMPLES DURING INCUBATION WERE ANALYZED BY TETRAMETHYLAMMONIUM HYDROXIDE THERMOCHEMOLYSIS-GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROMETRY (TMAH-GC/MS) AND FLUORESCENCE ANALYSIS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION THE CUMULATIVE CO2 EMISSION FROM PEAT UNDER DWARF BAMBOO WAS HIGHER THAN THAT OF PEAT UNDER MARSH VEGETATION.

THE COALS RANGE IN RANK FROM LIGNITE TO SEMIANTHRACITE. PETROGRAPHICALLY, THE COAL IS COMPOSED DOMINANTLY OF MACERALS OF THE VITRINITE GROUP (> 50% BY VOLUME). THE COALS FROM THE REGIONS OF ANTIOQUIA, CORDOBA, AND CALDAS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RELATIVELY HIGH PROPORTIONS OF LIPTINITE (UP TO 30 VOL%). THE INERTINITE CONTENTS VARY UP TO 30 VOL%, AND THE COALS FROM THE REGIONS OF BOYACA AND GUAJIRA CONTAIN THE HIGHEST QUANTITIES OF THIS MACERAL GROUP.

THESE ARE PRIMARILY AFFORESTED SWAMPS WITH LOW-QUALITY FOREST STANDS. A SIGNIFICANT PART OF RAISED BOGS IS GENERALLY FORESTLESS. MEANWHILE, ABOUT 60 % OF THE EUTROPHIC AND MESOTROPHIC SWAMPS ARE POTENTIALLY RICH. HERE, ONLY EXCESS OF WATER INTERFERES WITH SUCCESSFUL FOREST GROWTH. THE WORLD FORESTRY HAS ACCUMULATED WIDE EXPERIENCE IN REGULATION OF SOIL WATER RETENTION THROUGH IRRIGATION IMPROVEMENT AND DRAINAGE. IN RUSSIA THERE ARE CLASSIC EXAMPLES WHEN STANDS OF THE 1ST QUALITY CLASS GREW IN THE LARGE (SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF HECTARES) AREAS AFTER IRRIGATION IMPROVEMENT. ONE SUCH CASE IS THE KHEYNOVSKOYE SWAMP WITH AN AREA OF OVER 2 THS. HA LOCATED IN THE LISINO TRAINING AND EXPERIMENTAL FOREST OF THE SAINT-PETERSBURG STATE FOREST TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY AND DRAINED IN 1847. HOWEVER, THERE ARE ENOUGH CASES OF UNSUCCESSFUL DRAINAGE. THE BETTER HALF OF THE DRAINED SWAMPS BEFORE DRAINAGE WERE GROWN OVER WITH FORESTS. IRRIGATION IMPROVEMENT HAS TURNED AROUND THE GROWTH CONDITIONS OF ALL STANDS EXISTED BEFORE DRAINAGE, BUT IN POOR EUTROPHIC SWAMPS FOREST GROWTH IS INSUFFICIENT. THE RESEARCH PURPOSE WAS TO STUDY BRAND NEW STANDS IN THE DRAINED TERRITORY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE WHOLE FORMATION CYCLE OF THE BIOTOPE AND ITS CHANGE WITH TIME. IN ORDER TO GET THAT DONE, A PILOT PLOT WAS LAID OUT ON A EUTROPHIC-MCSOTROPHIC TREELESS PEAT. WHERE DRAINAGE WAS CARRIED OUT USING A FREQUENT NETWORK OF SMALL GROOVES (FURROWS). THEY WERE DUG WITH THE HELP OF A DOUBLE MOLDBOARD (TRENCH DIGGER) AND DIRECTED INTO THE CHANNELS OF THE DRAINAGE NETWORK, THUS PROVIDING FOR CONSTANT WATER DRAINAGE. FOREST PLANTATIONS WERE LAID OUT ON THE LAYERS FORMED ALONG THE FURROWS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE AUTHOR. WE HAD BEEN ASSESSING CHANGES IN THE STAND CONDITION EACH 5-10 YEARS FOR ALMOST 60 YEARS. THE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IN THE FIRST YEARS AFTER REMOVAL OF EXCESS WATER AND BETTER SOIL WARMING, SEDIMENTATION AND DEPLETION OF PEAT OCCURRED. AT A DEPTH OF 0.4-0.5 M IN 20 YEARS AFTER PLANTING THE TREES, THE DEPTH OF PEAT DECREASED BY ALMOST 2 TIMES.

IT CAN BE ASSUMED THAT WHEN GROWING WOOD PULP FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSES IN 100 YEARS TWO YIELDS CAN BE HARVESTED. CHANGES IN PEAT SOIL HAVE TAKEN PLACE DURING THE LAST 50 YEARS.

HOWEVER, SO FAR LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT POTENTIAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL OR THERMODYNAMIC INDICATORS FOR THE OBSERVED INHIBITION OF FURTHER DECOMPOSITION. FOR EXAMPLE, THEORETICAL ENERGY YIELDS FOR METHANOGENESIS, HYDROGEN PARTIAL PRESSURES, STABLE ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION FACTORS BETWEEN CO2 AND CH4, AND ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AS THERMODYAMIC INDICATORS FOR SUCH INHIBITION. TO TEST THE APPLICABILITY AND EXPLANATORY POWER OF THESE INDICATORS TO IDENTIFY CONDITIONS INHIBITING ORGANIC MATTER DECOMPOSITION, WE INCUBATED HOMOGENIZED OMBROTROPHIC PEAT FOR 300 DAYS AT 20 DEGREES C UNDER DIFFUSIVE FLUX CONDITIONS AS CONTROL, AND COMPARED THE OBSERVED EFFECTS TO A TREATMENT WITH VERTICAL ADVECTIVE TRANSPORT BY WATER CIRCULATION AND TO A TREATMENT IN WHICH BOTH THE UNSATURATED AND WATER-SATURATED ZONE OF THE PEAT PROFILE WERE KEPT ANOXIC.

WHILE CO2 AND CH4 PRODUCTION SLOWED SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE DEEP PEAT PROFILE, A CONCOMITANT DECREASE OF GIBS FREE ENERGY YIELDS AVAILABLE TO HYDROGENOTROPHIC AND ACETOCLASTIC METHANOGENSIS AND HYDROGEN AND ACETATE CONCENTRATIONS OVER TIME SUPPORTED A THERMODYNAMIC CONSTRAINT ON METHANOGENESIS.

TRANSIENTLY ELEVATED H-2 CONCENTRATIONS, NOT RELATED TO ACTUAL METHANOGENESIS RATES WERE OBSERVED FOR ABOUT 150-225 DAYS. THEREAFTER, HYDROGEN CONCENTRATIONS DIMINISHED TO LEVELS BELOW THRESHOLDS TO THERMODYNAMICALLY SUPPORT ONGOING METHANOGENESIS.

CRYOSTRATIGRAPHIC EVIDENCE IMPLIES ONLY ONE OF THE SEVEN STUDIED DTLBS UNDERWENT MULTIPLE THERMOKARST CYCLES.

IT IS SHOWN THAT THE PROCESS OF HUMUS ACCUMULATION IS CHARACTERIZED BY LOW INTENSITY, WHICH IS CAUSED BY A COMPLEX OF REASONS, IN PARTICULAR, THE SANDY COMPOSITION OF SOD-PODZOLIC SOILS (PARTICLE CONTENT < 0,01 MM 7,5 %).THE THICKNESS OF THE PROFILE HUMUS PORTION IS 18 CM.

WE EXPERIMENTALLY ADDRESSED THIS CRITICAL QUESTION BY SUBJECTING INTACT PLANT-SOIL SYSTEMS IN A UK UPLAND ECOSYSTEM TO SIMULATED CLIMATE WARMING UNDER NATURAL FIELD CONDITIONS. WE REPORT THE RESULTS OF A 13-YEAR FIELD-BASED CLIMATE MANIPULATION EXPERIMENT COMBINING IN SITU RESPIRATION MEASUREMENTS WITH RADIOCARBON (C-14) ANALYSES OF RESPIRED CO2, DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC), SOIL AND THE TISSUE CONTENTS OF THE DOMINANT SOIL FAUNA (ENCHYTRAEIDS). WE FOUND THAT WARMING DURING THE GROWING SEASON PRODUCED THE LARGELY EXPECTED INCREASES IN ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION (63%) AND LEACHING OF DOC (19%) WITH NO EVIDENCE FOR THERMAL ACCLIMATION OR SUBSTRATE EXHAUSTION OVER THE WHOLE 13-YEAR EXPERIMENTAL PERIOD. CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS, WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT AN INCREASED RELEASE OF OLD SOIL C AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE OF SIMULATED CLIMATIC CHANGE, AND INDEED, C-14 ANALYSES INDICATED THAT WARMING CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT TOWARDS MINERALISATION OF MORE RECENT PLANT-DERIVED C INPUTS. FURTHER SUPPORT CAME FROM THE RADIOCARBON ANALYSES OF THE ENCHYTRAEID TISSUES, WHICH SHOWED A GREATER ASSIMILATION OF THE MORE RECENT (PLANT-DERIVED) C SOURCES FOLLOWING WARMING.

THE COALS IN THE SEAM XI REPRESENT POLYMETALLIC ORES OF OF NB-TA-ZR-HF-Y-REE-GA COMPOSITION. THEIR FORMATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE THICK (6-15 ) NON-COAL LAYERS, CONTRASTIVELY ENRICHED WITH NB, TA, ZR, HF, Y, REE, GA, TH, U, SN AND OTHER LITHOPHYLIC ELEMENTS, IN THE COAL SEAM. GEOCHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE LAYERS AND THE COMPOSITION OF RELICT MINERALS ALLOWS CONNECTING THESE HORIZONS WITH THE INPUT OF ACID VOLCANIC PYROCLASTIC MATERIAL OF ALKALINE COMPOSITION DURING PEAT ACCUMULATION. THE RESTORED COMPOSITION SHOWS THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE VOLCANOGENIC PYROCLASTICS TO COMENDITES-PANTELLERITES. A POSSIBLE SOURCE ARE PANTELLERITE ASHES OF MONGOLIA AND SOUTH-EAST OF SIBERIA. THEY ARE CONTRASTIVELY ENRICHED WITH NB, TA, ZR, HF, Y, REE, GA, TH AND U. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT THE PROCESS OF COALIFICATION WAS ACCOMPANIED BY REDISTRIBUTION OF THESE ELEMENTS IN THE COAL SEAM AND THE FORMATION OF RARE METAL MINERALIZATION. THE REDISTRIBUTION OCCURRED IN THE EARLY STAGES OF COALIFICATION WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF SODA WATER. DISTRIBUTION OF MAIN ORE ELEMENTS IN THE VERTICAL SECTION OF THE COAL SEAM EMPHASIZES THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE VOLCANOGENIC PYROCLASTIC HORIZON AND REFLECTS THE GEOCHEMICAL ZONATION DUE TO THE CHEMICAL ELEMENTS MIGRATION WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS.

SOME ELEMENTS ARE FOUND IN THE SCATTERED FORM IN ORGANIC MATTER. THE EPIGENETIC GENESIS OF MOST MINERALS IS CLEARLY VISIBLE BY THEIR DISTRIBUTION IN THE COAL MATRIX, CONFINEDNESS TO THE PORE VOLUME, MICRO-VEINS AND PARTS DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE VOLCANIC LAYER. THE STUDIES ALLOW TO DEVELOP A MODEL OF FORMATION WITH SIMILAR MINERALIZATION IN COALS AND TO OFFER A SET OF SEARCH CRITERIA FOR ITS DISCOVERY. THE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF SUCH ORES IS THE LAYER OF VOLCANIC PYROCLASTIC ROCKS OF ALKALINE COMPOSITION, CHARACTERIZED BY INCREASED RADIOACTIVITY. THIS FEATURE ALLOWS FINDING SUCH HORIZONS WITH GAMMA-RAY LOGGING EVEN AT THE PRELIMINARY STAGE OF COAL-BEARING AREAS STUDY. THE CONNECTION OF COMPLEX NB-TA-ZR-HF-Y-REE-GA MINERALIZATION WITH VOLCANOGENIC PYROCLASTICS OF ALKALINE COMPOSITION SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDS THE PERSPECTIVES FOR THE DETECTION OF SUCH MINERALIZATION IN THE COALS OF EAST AND CENTRAL ASIA.

ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES AND ADVANCES IN INSTRUMENTATION ARE DISCUSSED, FOCUSING ON THE MEASUREMENT OF LIGHT STABLE ISOTOPE RATIOS (I.E., FOR C, H, N, S, AND O) USING ISOTOPE RATIO MASS SPECTROMETRY (IRMS). EARLY SOIL ISOTOPE WORK (1950-2000S) FOCUSED ON AGRICULTURAL SOILS AND SOIL FERTILITY ISSUES. THESE STUDIES INCLUDED THE USE OF RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES SUCH AS C-14 AND S-35, AND (OR) ARTIFICIALLY ENRICHED STABLE ISOTOPES INCLUDING N-15-LABELLED FERTILIZERS.

EARLY IN THE LATE HOLOCENE THERE WERE BIRCH FORESTS WITH OAK AND OTHER BROADLEAF TREES; VAST AREAS WERE OCCUPIED BY FORB MEADOWS. UNDER COOLING (3250 YR BP) THE SHRUB PINE (PINUS PUMILA) BECAME THE LANDSCAPE-FORMING SPECIES, AND SINCE 2490 YR BP SELAGINELLA SELAGINOIDES APPEARED IN ABUNDANCE. THE LITTLE ICE AGE WAS MARKED BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF BROADLEAF TREES AND WIDELY SPREAD HEATH LAND COMMUNITIES. THE HIGHER STANDS OF THE LAKE LEVEL WERE RELATED TO WARMINGS (3660-3590; 3450-3180; 2960-2840; 2410-2260 CAL YR BP). SHALLOWING COINCIDED WITH SHORT-TERM COOLINGS (3590-3450; 3180-2960; 2840-2410; 2260-2150 CAL YR BP) MARKED BY REDUCED PRECIPITATIONS. THE DUNE RIDGE FORMATION BEGAN DURING THE LONGEST COOLING ACCOMPANIED BY A MINOR REGRESSION. THE DUNES WERE STABILIZED AND A PALEOSOL DEVELOPED SIMILAR TO 2340-2260 YR BP. A YOUNGER GENERATION OF EOLIAN SANDS DEVELOPED DURING THE LITTLE ICE AGE. AN ECOLOGICAL EFFECT OF VOLCANIC ASHFALLS HAS BEEN ESTIMATED. THE LOCAL BIOTIC COMPONENTS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN MOST AFFLICTED BY THE ERUPTION IN THE NORTH OF ITURUP IN SIMILAR TO 2100-2300 CAL YR BP, WHEN CKR TEPHRA UP TO 30 CM THICK WAS DEPOSITED. THE AGES OF 4 STRONGEST TSUNAMIS THAT OCCURRED OVER THE LAST 3660 YEARS WERE DETERMINED. THEY APPEARED TO BE RELATED TO THE EARTHQUAKES WITH FOCUSES CLOSE TO URUP ISLAND OR SOUTH OF IT.

BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE MOLECULAR COMPOSITION OF HUMIC ACIDS, WE ASSESSED THE PROCESSES OF ACCUMULATION OF THE KEY STRUCTURAL FRAGMENTS, THEIR TRANSFORMATIONS AND THE STABILIZATION RATES OF CARBON POOLS IN SOILS IN GENERAL. THE LANDSCAPE OF THE LENA RIVER DELTA IS THE LARGEST STORAGE OF STABILIZED ORGANIC MATTER IN THE ARCTIC. THERE IS ACTIVE ACCUMULATION AND DEPOSITION OF A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SOIL ORGANIC CARBON FROM TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS IN A PERMAFROST STATE. UNDER ONGOING CLIMATE CHANGE, CARBON EMISSION FLUXES INTO THE ATMOSPHERE ARE ESTIMATED TO BE HIGHER THAN THE SEQUESTRATION AND STORING OF CARBON COMPOUNDS. THUS, INVESTIGATION OF SOIL ORGANIC MATTER STABILIZATION MECHANISMS AND RATES IS QUITE AN URGENT TOPIC REGARDING POLAR SOILS. FOR STUDY OF MOLECULAR ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION, HUMIC ACIDS WERE SEPARATED FROM THE SOILS OF THE LENA RIVER DELTA. KEY STRUCTURAL FRAGMENTS OF HUMIC MATTER WERE IDENTIFIED AND QUANTIFIED BY CP/MAS C-13 NMR SPECTROSCOPY: CARBOXYL (-COOR); CARBONYL (-C=O); CH3-; CH2-; CH-ALIPHATIC; -C-OR ALCOHOLS, ESTERS AND CARBOHYDRATES; AND THE PHENOLIC (AR-OH), QUINONE (AR = O) AND AROMATIC (AR-) GROUPS AS BENCHMARK CRYOSOLS OF THE LENA DELTA RIVER TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEM. UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF THERMODYNAMIC EVOLUTIONARY SELECTION, DURING THE CHANGE BETWEEN THE DRY AND WET SEASONS, UP TO 41% OF AROMATIC AND CARBOXYL FRAGMENTS ACCUMULATED IN HUMIC ACIDS. DATA OBTAINED SHOWED THAT THREE MAIN GROUPS OF CARBON PLAYED THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE IN SOIL ORGANIC MATTER STABILIZATION, NAMELY C, H-ALKYLS ((CH2)N/CH/C AND CH3), AROMATIC COMPOUNDS (C-C/C-H, C-O) AND AN OCH GROUP (OCH/OCQ). THE VARIATIONS OF THESE CARBON SPECIES' CONTENT IN SEPARATED HUMICS, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO SOIL-PERMAFROST ORGANIC PROFILES' RECALCITRANCE IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT, IS DISCUSSED.","ASSESSMENTS OF ORGANIC CARBON STABILIZATION USING THE SPECTROSCOPIC CHARACTERISTICS OF HUMIC ACIDS SEPARATED FROM SOILS OF THE LENA RIVER DELTA","SEPARATIONS","ARTICLE","JUN",2021,"10.3390/separations8060087","CHEMISTRY, ANALYTICAL","WOS:000666254300001"

THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH IS TO STUDY CHEMICAL ELEMENTS CONTENT LEVEL IN SOILS AND SURFACE WATERS OF THE CENTRAL, SOUTHERN AND SOUTH-EASTERN PARTS OF THE UKOK PLATEAU, TO GIVE AN ECOLOGICAL AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL ASSESSMENT OF THIS LITTLE-STUDIED AREA. OBJECTS: MAIN SOIL TYPES (MOLLIC LEPTOSOLS EUTRIC, UMBRIC LEPTOSOLS DYSTRIC, LITHIC LEPTOSOLS BRUNIC) AND SURFACE WATER (RIVERS ZHUMALY, KALGUTY, ARGAMZHI, AK-ALAKH, TARKHAT AND LAKE UKOK) OF THE PLATEAU UKOK (ALTAI REPUBLIC, RUSSIAN FEDERATION). METHODS. METAL CONTENT IN SOILS WAS DETERMINED BY THE APPROXIMATE-QUANTITATIVE EMISSION SPECTRAL ANALYSIS AT THE INSTITUTE OF GEOCHEMISTRY AND MINERALOGY OF SB RAS, WHILE THE CONTENT OF TRACE ELEMENTS IN NATURAL WATERS WAS DEFINED BY MEANS OF THE ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROMETRY USING ELECTROTHERMAL ATOMIZATION AT THE CHEMICAL ANALYTICAL CENTER OF IWEP SB RAS. RESULTS. THE PAPER PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF STUDYING CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOILS AND SURFACE WATERS OF THE HIGH-MOUNTAIN PLATEAU UKOK. THE CONCENTRATIONS OF CHEMICAL ELEMENTS IN SOILS OF THE PLATEAU DO NOT EXCEED THEIR CLARKS IN THE SOIL COVER AND CORRESPOND TO THOSE IN THE MOUNTAIN-TUNDRA SOILS OF ALTAI, EXCEPT FOR THE SOILS AND PARENT ROCKS ABOVE THE KALGUTY W-MO-V-CU DEPOSIT DISTINGUISHED BY THE ABNORMALLY HIGH CONTENT OF TUNGSTEN (UP TO 30-60 MG/KG). THE INCREASED CONTENT OF CU IN THE WATERS OF THE RIVER KALGUTY (16 MU G/DM(3)) AND THE SOILS OF THE BASIN IS RELATED TO THE HALOS AND THE INFLUENCE OF PILINGS AND TAILINGS OF THE CONCENTRATION PLANT. THE PLATEAU SOILS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY LOW GROSS CONTENT OF P AND CA NEEDED FOR PLANTS, BUT ENRICHED WITH POTASSIUM, THE CONTENT OF WHICH EXCEEDS 2 % IN MORE THAN HALF OF THE SAMPLES. IN SOILS OF THE UKOK PLATEAU, P CONTENT INCREASES FROM WEST TO EAST, FROM TRUE SURFACE (CENTRAL) PART TO THE EDGING MOUNTAINS THAT IS DUE TO PHOSPHOR PRESENCE IN INDIGENOUS ROCKS OF THE ALTAI-SAYAN MOUNTAIN COUNTRY. AT PRESENT, LOW ELUVIAL-ACCUMULATIVE RATIOS OF METALS IN THE STUDIED SOILS OF THE PLATEAU ARE EVIDENCE OF THE LACK OF PRONOUNCED ANTHROPOGENIC POLLUTION. THE CONTENT OF MOST ELEMENTS IN SOILS INCREASES WITH DEPTH. IN MOUNTAIN-TUNDRA PEAT SOILS, THE BIOGENIC ACCUMULATION OF MN WAS FOUND UNDER DWARF BIRCHES. FOR STEPPE SOILS, SOME ACCUMULATION OF ZN, CR, V AND NI WAS OBSERVED IN SURFACE HORIZONS. PB AND ZN HAD THE MOST UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION. THE INITIAL HETEROGENEITY OF MORAINE AND LAKE-GLACIAL DEPOSITS DETERMINES THE DIVERSITY OF INTRA-PROFILE DISTRIBUTION OF METALS IN THE FORMED SOILS. CLEAR DEPENDENCE OF MOST MACRO-AND MICROELEMENTS CONTENT IN SURFACE WATERS ON THEIR CONCENTRATIONS IN SOILS WAS NOT ESTABLISHED. NEVERTHELESS, THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN THE INTENSITY OF WATER MIGRATION OF IRON IN WETLANDS OF THE BERTEK PART OF THE AK-ALAKH RIVER BASIN, WHERE ITS CONTENT WAS THE HIGHEST.","CHEMICAL ELEMENTS IN SOILS AND SURFACE WATERS OF THE UKOK PLATEAU (SOUTH-EASTERN ALTAI)","BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING","ARTICLE",NA,2020,"10.18799/24131830/2020/1/2445","ENGINEERING, GEOLOGICAL","WOS:000510838300004"

THE LATTER COULD BE SUBJECTED TO VARIOUS TYPES OF ENVIRONMENTAL INSULTS. IN MANY CASES, CRIMINALS TRY TO DISPOSE OF OR CONCEAL THE EVIDENCE IN SEVERAL WAYS, SUCH AS THROWING IN THE WATERWAYS OR BURYING IN THE SOIL TO AVOID DETECTION FROM THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THUS, CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATORS OFTEN FACE CHALLENGES TO DETECT AND DEVELOP LATENT FINGERMARKS IN SUCH ENVIRONMENTS. THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE PERSISTENCE AND AGEING OF LATENT FINGERMARKS IN A BURIAL ENVIRONMENT FOR PARTICULAR PERIODS. TO DATE, THERE IS A LIMITED STUDY THAT ATTEMPTED TO INVESTIGATE THE SURVIVABILITY OF FINGERMARKS IN A BURIAL ENVIRONMENT. METHODOLOGY: THE EXPERIMENT WAS CARRIED OUT IN TWO SETTINGS: PRELIMINARY AND MAIN EXPERIMENTS. A PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED INDOOR TO DETERMINE THE MOST EFFECTIVE CHEMICAL FOR FINGERMARK DEVELOPMENT ON BURIED METAL SUBSTRATES. FIVE DIFFERENT CHEMICALS WERE EMPLOYED TO DEVELOP THE LATENT FINGERMARKS, NAMELY FINGERMARK POWDER DUSTING, SMALL PARTICLE REAGENT (SPR), SUDAN BLACK, OIL RED 0, AND CRYSTAL VIOLET THE MAIN EXPERIMENT WAS CARRIED OUT TO SIMULATE THE REALISTIC SITUATION IN WHICH THE METAL SUBSTRATES BEARING LATENT FINGERMARKS WERE BURIED IN THE SOIL WITHIN 2 MONTHS PERIOD. IN BOTH EXPERIMENTS, THE SUBSTRATES WERE BURIED IN PEAT SOIL AT A DEPTH OF 10 CM FROM THE SURFACE. RESULTS: THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT LATENT FINGERMARKS COULD BE EFFECTIVELY RECOVERED AFTER BEING BURIED IN THE SOIL UP TO 8 WEEKS USING SUDAN BLACK THE POSITION OF THE SUBSTRATES WHETHER UNDERLYING IN ""FACE UP"" OR ""FACE DOWN"" ORIENTATIONS WHEN BURIED HAD ALSO INFLUENCED THE QUALITY OF THE DEVELOPED FINGERMARKS. FINGERMARKS BURIED IN THE ""FACE UP"" POSITION DEMONSTRATED BETTER QUALITY AND MORE RIDGE DETAILS AS COMPARED TO THOSE BURIED IN THE ""FACE DOWN"" POSITION. SECONDARY FINGERMARKS WERE ALSO OBSERVED IN THIS STUDY AND FOUND TO BE USEFUL FOR IDENTIFICATION AND MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN DEVELOPING FINGERMARKS ON BURIED ITEMS IN FORENSIC CASES. CONCLUSION: THE DEVELOPMENT OF FINGERMARKS RECOVERED FROM BURIAL ENVIRONMENTS IS FEASIBLE AS EXCELLENT RIDGE CHARACTERISTICS CAN STILL BE IDENTIFIED. HENCE, ANY EVIDENCE RECOVERED FROM BURIAL SITES SHOULD BE EXAMINED FOR FINGERMARKS AND CANNOT BE DISCOUNTED.","RECOVERY OF LATENT FINGERMARKS FROM BURIAL ENVIRONMENTS","EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES","ARTICLE","OCT 2",2020,"10.1186/s41935-020-00206-2","MEDICINE, LEGAL","WOS:000576935000002"

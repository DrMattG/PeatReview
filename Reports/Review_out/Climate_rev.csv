DAVIDSON EA, 2006, NATURE;"DAVIDSON EA;JANSSENS IA";SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CARBON IS STORED IN THE WORLD'S SOILS-INCLUDING PEATLANDS, WETLANDS AND PERMAFROST-THAN IS PRESENT IN THE ATMOSPHERE. DISAGREEMENT EXISTS, HOWEVER, REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON GLOBAL SOIL CARBON STOCKS. IF CARBON STORED BELOWGROUND IS TRANSFERRED TO THE ATMOSPHERE BY A WARMING-INDUCED ACCELERATION OF ITS DECOMPOSITION, A POSITIVE FEEDBACK TO CLIMATE CHANGE WOULD OCCUR. CONVERSELY, IF INCREASES OF PLANT-DERIVED CARBON INPUTS TO SOILS EXCEED INCREASES IN DECOMPOSITION, THE FEEDBACK WOULD BE NEGATIVE. DESPITE MUCH RESEARCH, A CONSENSUS HAS NOT YET EMERGED ON THE TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY OF SOIL CARBON DECOMPOSITION. UNRAVELLING THE FEEDBACK EFFECT IS PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT, BECAUSE THE DIVERSE SOIL ORGANIC COMPOUNDS EXHIBIT A WIDE RANGE OF KINETIC PROPERTIES, WHICH DETERMINE THE INTRINSIC TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY OF THEIR DECOMPOSITION. MOREOVER, SEVERAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS OBSCURE THE INTRINSIC TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY OF SUBSTRATE DECOMPOSITION, CAUSING LOWER OBSERVED 'APPARENT' TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY, AND THESE CONSTRAINTS MAY, THEMSELVES, BE SENSITIVE TO CLIMATE.;TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY OF SOIL CARBON DECOMPOSITION AND FEEDBACKS TO CLIMATE CHANGE;NATURE;REVIEW;mar.09;2006;10.1038/nature04514;MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES;WOS:000235839500036
BRIDGHAM SD, 2006, WETLANDS;"BRIDGHAM SD;MEGONIGAL JP;KELLER JK;BLISS NB;TRETTIN C";"WE EXAMINE THE CARBON BALANCE OF NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS BY REVIEWING AND SYNTHESIZING THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE AND SOIL DATABASES. NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS CONTAIN ABOUT 220 PG C, MOST OF WHICH IS IN PEAT. THEY ARE A SMALL TO MODERATE CARBON SINK OF ABOUT 49 TG C YR(-1), ALTHOUGH THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THIS ESTIMATE IS GREATER THAN 100%, WITH THE LARGEST UNKNOWN BEING THE ROLE OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION BY SEDIMENTATION IN FRESHWATER MINERAL-SOIL WETLANDS. WE ESTIMATE THAT NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS EMIT 9 TG METHANE (CH4) YR(-1); HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTY OF THIS ESTIMATE IS ALSO GREATER THAN 100%. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ESTUARINE WETLANDS, CH4 EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS MAY LARGELY OFFSET ANY POSITIVE BENEFITS OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN SOILS AND PLANTS IN TERMS OF CLIMATE FORCING. HISTORICALLY, THE DESTRUCTION OF WETLANDS THROUGH LAND-USE CHANGES HAS HAD THE LARGEST EFFECTS ON THE CARBON FLUXES AND CONSEQUENT RADIATIVE FORCING OF NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS. THE PRIMARY EFFECTS HAVE BEEN A REDUCTION IN THEIR ABILITY TO SEQUESTER CARBON (A SMALL TO MODERATE INCREASE IN RADIATIVE FORCING), OXIDATION OF THEIR SOIL CARBON RESERVES UPON DRAINAGE (A SMALL INCREASE IN RADIATIVE FORCING), AND REDUCTION IN CH4 EMISSIONS (A SMALL TO LARGE DECREASE IN RADIATIVE FORCING). IT IS UNCERTAIN HOW GLOBAL CHANGES WILL AFFECT THE CARBON POOLS AND FLUXES OF NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS. WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PREDICT ACCURATELY THE ROLE OF WETLANDS AS POTENTIAL POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE FEEDBACKS TO ANTHROPOGENIC GLOBAL CHANGE WITHOUT KNOWING THE INTEGRATIVE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE CONCENTRATIONS, AND ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION OF NITROGEN AND SULFUR ON THE CARBON BALANCE OF NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS.";THE CARBON BALANCE OF NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS;WETLANDS;REVIEW;DEC;2006;"10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[889:TCBONA]2.0.CO;2";"ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES";WOS:000243370000002
AERTS R, 2006, J ECOL;AERTS R;1 DECOMPOSITION OF PLANT LITTER, A KEY COMPONENT OF THE GLOBAL CARBON BUDGET, IS HIERARCHICALLY CONTROLLED BY THE TRIAD: CLIMATE > LITTER QUALITY > SOIL ORGANISMS. GIVEN THE SENSITIVITY OF DECOMPOSITION TO TEMPERATURE, ESPECIALLY IN COLD BIOMES, IT HAS BEEN HYPOTHESIZED THAT GLOBAL WARMING WILL LEAD TO INCREASED LITTER DECOMPOSITION RATES, BOTH THROUGH DIRECT TEMPERATURE EFFECTS AND THROUGH INDIRECT EFFECTS ON LITTER QUALITY AND SOIL ORGANISMS. 2 A META-ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL WARMING STUDIES IN COLD BIOMES (34 SITE-SPECIES COMBINATIONS) SHOWED THAT WARMING RESULTED IN SLIGHTLY INCREASED DECOMPOSITION RATES. HOWEVER, THIS RESPONSE WAS STRONGLY DEPENDENT ON THE METHOD USED: OPEN TOP CHAMBERS REDUCED DECOMPOSITION RATES, WHEREAS HEATING LAMPS STIMULATED DECOMPOSITION RATES. THE LOW RESPONSIVENESS WAS MAINLY DUE TO MOISTURE-LIMITED DECOMPOSITION RATES IN THE WARMING TREATMENTS, ESPECIALLY AT MESIC AND XERIC SITES. THIS CONTROL OF LITTER DECOMPOSITION BY BOTH TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE WAS CORROBORATED BY NATURAL GRADIENT STUDIES. 3 INTERSPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN LITTER QUALITY AND DECOMPOSABILITY ARE SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER THAN WARMING-INDUCED PHENOTYPIC RESPONSES. THUS, THE CHANGES IN THE SPECIES COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF PLANT COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN MEDIUM-TERM WARMING STUDIES IN COLD BIOMES WILL HAVE A CONSIDERABLY GREATER IMPACT ON ECOSYSTEM LITTER DECOMPOSITION THAN PHENOTYPIC RESPONSES. 4 SOIL FAUNA COMMUNITIES IN COLD BIOMES ARE RESPONSIVE TO CLIMATE WARMING. MOREOVER, TEMPERATURE-DRIVEN MIGRATION OF THE, HITHERTO ABSENT, LARGE COMMINUTERS TO HIGH-LATITUDE SITES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE DECOMPOSITION RATES. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT KNOW HOW FAR-REACHING THE CONSEQUENCES OF CHANGES IN THE SPECIES COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF THE SOIL COMMUNITY ARE FOR LITTER DECOMPOSITION, AS THERE IS A LACK OF DATA ON FUNCTIONAL SPECIES REDUNDANCY AND THE SPECIES' DISPERSAL ABILITY. 5 GLOBAL WARMING WILL LEAD TO INCREASED LITTER DECOMPOSITION RATES ONLY IF THERE IS SUFFICIENT SOIL MOISTURE. HENCE, CLIMATE SCENARIO AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES SHOULD FOCUS MORE ON BOTH FACTORS AND THEIR INTERACTION. AS INTERSPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN POTENTIAL DECOMPOSABILITY AND LITTER CHEMISTRY ARE SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER THAN PHENOTYPIC RESPONSES TO WARMING, THE FOCUS OF FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD BE ON THE FORMER. IN ADDITION, MORE LIGHT SHOULD BE SHED ON THE BELOW-GROUND 'DARKNESS' TO EVALUATE THE ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF WARMING-INDUCED SOIL FAUNA COMMUNITY CHANGES FOR LITTER DECOMPOSITION PROCESSES IN COLD BIOMES.;THE FREEZER DEFROSTING: GLOBAL WARMING AND LITTER DECOMPOSITION RATES IN COLD BIOMES;JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY;REVIEW;JUL;2006;10.1111/j.1365-2745.2006.01142.x;"PLANT SCIENCES; ECOLOGY";WOS:000237972700001
JOABSSON A, 1999, TRENDS ECOL EVOL;"JOABSSON A;CHRISTENSEN TR;WALLEN B";METHANE EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS ARE HIGHLY VARIABLE, BOTH SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY AND AT SCALES RANGING FROM MICROTOPOGRAPHIC TO REGIONAL DIFFERENCES. TO COMPREHEND THIS VARIATION FULLY AND ALSO TO PREDICT RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE, AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTIMATE LINKAGE BETWEEN CARBON CYCLING AND METHANE EMISSION IN THESE SYSTEMS IS NEEDED. THE PRESENCE OF VASCULAR PLANTS HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED RECENTLY AS ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS CONTROLLING THE SCALE OF METHANE FLUXES BECAUSE IT AFFECTS PROCESSES COUPLED TO TRANSPORT, PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF METHANE.

ADDITIONAL CARBON SOURCES ASSOCIATED WITH METHANE HYDRATE RELEASE (E.G. PORE-WATER VENTING AND TURBIDITE OXIDATION) ARE ALSO INSUFFICIENT. WE FIND THAT THE OXIDATION OF AT LEAST 5000 GT C OF ORGANIC CARBON IS THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION FOR THE OBSERVED GEOCHEMICAL AND CLIMATIC CHANGES DURING THE PETM, FOR WHICH THERE ARE SEVERAL POTENTIAL MECHANISMS. PRODUCTION OF THERMOGENIC CH4 AND CO2 DURING CONTACT METAMORPHISM ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTRUSION OF A LARGE IGNEOUS PROVINCE INTO ORGANIC RICH SEDIMENTS [H. SVENSEN, S. PLANKE, A. MALTHE-SORENSSEN, B.

IN ADDITION, THIS HYPOTHESIS REQUIRES AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF CARBON STORED IN PEAT. THE ISOLATION OF A LARGE EPICONTINENTAL SEAWAY BY TECTONIC UPLIFT ASSOCIATED WITH VOLCANISM OR CONTINENTAL COLLISION, FOLLOWED BY DESICCATION AND BACTERIAL RESPIRATION OF THE AERATED ORGANIC MATTER IS ANOTHER POTENTIAL MECHANISM FOR THE RAPID RELEASE OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF CO2. IN ADDITION TO THE OXIDATION OF THE UNDERLYING MARINE SEDIMENTS, THE DESICCATION OF A MAJOR EPICONTINENTAL SEAWAY WOULD REMOVE A LARGE SOURCE OF MOISTURE FOR THE CONTINENTAL INTERIOR, RESULTING IN THE DESICCATION AND BACTERIAL OXIDATION OF ADJACENT TERRESTRIAL WETLANDS.

DALAL RC, 2008, AUST J BOT;"DALAL RC;ALLEN DE";"BESIDES WATER VAPOUR, GREENHOUSE GASES CO2, CH4, O-3 AND N2O CONTRIBUTE SIMILAR TO 60%, 20%, 10% AND 6% TO GLOBAL WARMING, RESPECTIVELY; MINOR CONTRIBUTION IS MADE BY CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS AND VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC). WE PRESENT CO2, CH4 AND N2O FLUXES FROM NATURAL AND RELATIVELY UNMANAGED SOIL-PLANT ECOSYSTEMS (THE ECOSYSTEMS MINIMALLY DISTURBED BY DIRECT HUMAN OR HUMAN- INDUCED ACTIVITIES). ALL NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS ARE NET SINKS FOR CO2, ALTHOUGH TUNDRA AND WETLANDS (INCLUDING PEATLANDS) ARE LARGE SOURCES OF CH4, WHEREAS SIGNIFICANT N2O EMISSIONS OCCUR MAINLY FROM TROPICAL AND TEMPERATE FORESTS. MOST NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS DECREASE NET GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) FROM - 0.03 +/- 0.35 T CO2-EHA(-1) Y(-1) (TROPICAL FORESTS) TO - 0.90 +/- 0.42 T CO2-E HA(-1) Y(-1) (TEMPERATE FORESTS) AND - 1.18 +/- 0.44 T CO2-E HA(-1) Y(-1) (BOREAL FORESTS), MOSTLY AS CO2 SINKS IN PHYTOBIOMASS, MICROBIAL BIOMASS AND SOIL C. BUT NET GWP CONTRIBUTIONS FROM WETLANDS ARE VERY LARGE, WHICH IS PRIMARILY DUE TO CH4 EMISSIONS. ALTHOUGH THE TROPICAL FOREST SYSTEM PROVIDES A LARGE CARBON SINK, THE NEGLIGIBLE CAPACITY OF TROPICAL FORESTS TO REDUCE GWP IS ENTIRELY DUE TO N2O EMISSIONS, POSSIBLY FROM RAPID N MINERALISATION UNDER FAVOURABLE TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE CONDITIONS. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS REDUCE THE NET ATMOSPHERIC GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS BY 3.55 +/- 0.44 GTCO(2)-EY(-1) OR SIMILAR TO 0.5 PPM(V) CO2-E Y(-1), HENCE, THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE OF NATURAL AND RELATIVELY UNMANAGED ECOSYSTEMS IN SLOWING GLOBAL WARMING AND CLIMATE CHANGE. HOWEVER, THE IMPACT OF INCREASING N DEPOSITION ON NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD, AND FURTHER UNDERSTANDING IS REQUIRED REGARDING THE USE OF DRAINAGE AS A MANAGEMENT TOOL, TO REDUCE CH4 EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS AND TO INCREASE GHG SINK FROM THE RESTORATION OF DEGRADED LANDS, INCLUDING SALINE AND SODIC SOILS.

MOORE PD, 2002, ENVIRON CONSERV;MOORE PD;THE TEMPERATE PEATLANDS ARE EXTENSIVE, COVERING AROUND 3.5 MILLION KM(2) OF LAND. THEY CONTAIN ABOUT 455 GT OF CARBON, ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO THE CARBON STORED IN ALL OF THE LIVING THINGS ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET, AND REPRESENTING AROUND 25% OF ALL THE SOIL CARBON ON EARTH. THESE BOGS ARE A SINK FOR ATMOSPHERIC CARBON AND THEIR CARBON UPTAKE ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 12% OF CURRENT HUMAN EMISSIONS. THEY VARY CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR FORM AND STRUCTURE AND ARE AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, INCLUDING THE STUDY OF PAST ENVIRONMENTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THEY ARE ALSO VALUABLE IN ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION. THEY ARE LOW IN BIODIVERSITY, BUT THEIR FAUNA AND FLORA ARE DISTINCTIVE AND MANY GROUPS ARE CONFINED TO THIS HABITAT. FOR ALL THESE REASONS, THE FUTURE CONSERVATION OF PEATLANDS IS A MATTER FOR CONCERN. THREATS TO PEATLANDS COME FROM DIRECT HUMAN EXPLOITATION IN THE FORM OF PEAT HARVESTING FOR ENERGY AND HORTICULTURE, AND DRAINAGE FOR FORESTRY. RISING ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS SHOULD CONTROL BOTH OF THESE PROCESSES IN THE WESTERN WORLD, BUT CONTINUED NORTHERN PEATLAND LOSSES ARE LIKELY LOCALLY, ESPECIALLY IN ASIA. PEATLAND DRAINAGE FOR FORESTRY OR AGRICULTURE WILL RESULT IN LOSSES OF CARBON TO THE ATMOSPHERE, ADDING TO THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT. HUMAN POPULATION PRESSURES, INDUSTRIALIZATION AND URBANIZATION ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE INFLUENCE IN THE BOREAL ZONE. FRAGMENTATION OF THE HABITAT IS NOT AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION BECAUSE BOGS ARE BY THEIR VERY NATURE 'ISLAND' HABITATS. ACIDIFICATION BY AERIAL POLLUTION MAY BE A LOCAL PROBLEM CLOSE TO SOURCES, BUT THE HABITAT IS NATURALLY ACID AND SHOULD NOT BE SEVERELY AFFECTED, THE INPUT OF AERIAL NUTRIENTS, HOWEVER, PARTICULARLY NITROGEN, COULD HAVE WIDESPREAD IMPACT ON BOGS, ENHANCING THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND ALTERING THEIR VEGETATION COMPOSITION. THE PHYSICAL REHABILITATION OF BOGS DAMAGED BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES PRESENTS MANY PROBLEMS, PARTICULARLY RELATING TO THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF PEAT STRUCTURE AND VEGETATION, BUT THE PROCESS CAN RESULT IN THE RE-FORMATION OF A CARBON SINK SO IT IS WORTH THE EFFORT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN ITS IMPACT ON BOGS. HIGHER TEMPERATURE (ESPECIALLY IF ACCOMPANIED BY RAISED ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS AND INCREASED NITRATE DEPOSITION) WILL ENHANCE PRODUCTIVITY, BUT WILL ALSO RESULT IN FASTER DECOMPOSITION RATES. THE OUTCOME OF THESE OPPOSING FACTORS FOR PEAT FORMATION WILL ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON THE FUTURE PATTERN OF PRECIPITATION. IF, AS SEEMS MOST LIKELY, SUMMER CONDITIONS BECOME WARMER AND DRIER IN CONTINENTAL REGIONS AND WINTERS BECOME MILDER AND WETTER, THE SUMMER DROUGHT COULD CAUSE PEAT LOSS AND BOG CONTRACTION. AN EXCESS OF DECOMPOSITION WILL LEAD TO BOGS BECOMING A CARBON SOURCE AND THUS A POSITIVE FEEDBACK IN GLOBAL WARMING. EMISSIONS OF METHANE AND NITROUS OXIDE WOULD ADD TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS PROBLEM, BUT LIKELY OXIDATION OF METHANE AND LOW N(2)O PRODUCTION MAY WELL MEAN THAT THIS IMPACT WILL NOT PROVE TO BE SIGNIFICANT. TREE INVASION OF BOGS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUMMER DROUGHT COULD LOCALLY LEAD TO INCREASED WATER LOSS THROUGH TRANSPIRATION, AND HIGHER HEAT ABSORPTION THROUGH ALBEDO CHANGE. THIS WILL ENHANCE THE DRYING EFFECT ON THE BOG SURFACE. OCEANIC MIRES WILL BE LESS SEVERELY AFFECTED IF THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN PRECIPITATION TAKES PLACE IN THESE REGIONS.

ANDERSEN R, 2013, SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM;"ANDERSEN R;CHAPMAN SJ;ARTZ RRE";EVEN THOUGH LARGE EXTENTS OF BOREAL PEATLANDS ARE STILL IN A PRISTINE CONDITION, ESPECIALLY IN NORTH AMERICA, EXTENSIVE AREAS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY NATURAL OR ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES THAT CHANGE SOME OF THE SYSTEMS FROM BEING SINKS TO SOURCES OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND SHIFT THE METHANE PRODUCTION/CONSUMPTION PATTERNS THROUGH ALTERATIONS OF BOTH ABOVE- AND BELOW-GROUND COMMUNITIES AND FUNCTIONS. IN ORDER TO FULLY ASSESS THE ROLE OF PEATLANDS ON GLOBAL C BALANCE, NOW AND IN THE FUTURE, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE DEEPEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF VARIOUS GROUPS OF MICROORGANISMS TO ORGANIC MATTER TRANSFORMATIONS. HERE, WE REVIEW THE DRIVERS STRUCTURING FUNGAL, BACTERIAL AND ARCHAEAL COMMUNITIES IN NATURAL PEATLANDS AND THE RESPONSE OF THESE MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES TO NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES, INCLUDING FIRE, DRAINAGE, NUTRIENT DEPOSITION, PEAT MINING AND CLIMATE CHANGE. THE MICROBIAL DIVERSITY IN PEATLANDS IS CHARACTERIZED BY ORGANISMS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED PHYSIOLOGICAL AND METABOLIC ADAPTATIONS TO COPE WITH THE CONSTRAINING CONDITIONS FOUND IN THESE ECOSYSTEMS, SUCH AS LOW OXYGEN AVAILABILITY, COLD TEMPERATURE, ACIDITY AND OLIGOTROPHY. FURTHERMORE, THESE UNIQUE ORGANISMS SOMETIMES APPEAR TO BE ORGANIZED AS REPEAT MOSAICS RESPONDING TO VEGETATION, PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS MORE THAN TO GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE, IN OTHER WORDS, SIMILAR TO THE MUCH VALUED BIODIVERSITY ASPECTS OF THE PEATLAND VEGETATION ITSELF AND ASSOCIATED HIGHER ORGANISMS. THE RESPONSE OF MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES TO DISTURBANCES IS FAR FROM FULLY UNDERSTOOD. IN PARTICULAR, WHILST MANY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED CHANGES IN MICROBIAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OR ON MICROBIALLY DRIVEN PROCESSES FOLLOWING A GIVEN DISTURBANCE, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR HOW THE TWO COMPONENTS, DIVERSITY AND FUNCTION, RELATE WITH EACH OTHER. FUTURE CHALLENGES INVOLVE DESIGNING STUDIES THAT WILL TEST WHETHER ECOLOGICAL THEORIES LIKE SPECIES SORTING, STRESS PHYSIOLOGY, TEMPORAL NICHE OR FUNCTIONAL REDUNDANCY CAN BE USED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT REGULATES MICROBIAL POPULATIONS AND ACTIVITY IN PEATLANDS, AND STUDIES THAT WILL ALLOW US TO PREDICT MORE ACCURATELY HOW PEATLANDS RESPOND TO GLOBAL CHANGE OR ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES.

KURZ WA, 2013, ENVIRON REV;"KURZ WA;SHAW CH;BOISVENUE C;STINSON G;METSARANTA J;LECKIE D;DYK A;SMYTH C;NEILSON ET";CANADA'S MANAGED BOREAL FOREST, 54% OF THE NATION'S TOTAL BOREAL FOREST AREA, STORES 28 PG CARBON (C) IN BIOMASS, DEAD ORGANIC MATTER, AND SOIL POOLS. THE NET C BALANCE IS DOMINATED BY THE DIFFERENCE OF TWO LARGE CONTINUOUS FLUXES: C UPTAKE (NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION) AND RELEASE DURING DECOMPOSITION (HETEROTROPHIC RESPIRATION). ADDITIONAL RELEASES OF C CAN BE HIGH IN YEARS, OR IN AREAS, THAT EXPERIENCE LARGE ANTHROPOGENIC OR NATURAL DISTURBANCES. FROM 1990 TO 2008, CANADA'S MANAGED BOREAL FOREST HAS ACTED AS C SINK OF 28 TG C YEAR(-1), REMOVING CO2 FROM THE ATMOSPHERE TO REPLACE THE 17 TG OF C ANNUALLY HARVESTED AND STORE AN ADDITIONAL 11 TG OF C YEAR-1 IN ECOSYSTEM C POOLS. A LARGE FRACTION (SIMILAR TO 57%) OF THE C HARVESTED SINCE 1990 REMAINS STORED IN WOOD PRODUCTS AND SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL SITES IN CANADA AND ABROAD, REPLACING C EMITTED FROM THE DECAY OR BURNING OF WOOD HARVESTED PRIOR TO 1990 AND CONTRIBUTING TO NET INCREASES IN PRODUCT AND LANDFILL C POOLS. WOOD PRODUCT USE HAS REDUCED EMISSIONS IN OTHER SECTORS BY SUBSTITUTING FOR EMISSION-INTENSIVE PRODUCTS (CONCRETE, STEEL). THE C BALANCE OF THE UNMANAGED BOREAL FOREST IS CURRENTLY UNKNOWN. THE FUTURE C BALANCE OF THE CANADIAN BOREAL FOREST WILL AFFECT THE GLOBAL ATMOSPHERIC C BUDGET AND INFLUENCE THE MITIGATION EFFORTS REQUIRED TO ATTAIN ATMOSPHERIC CO2 STABILIZATION TARGETS. THE SINGLE BIGGEST THREAT TO C STOCKS IS HUMAN-CAUSED CLIMATE CHANGE. LARGE C STOCKS HAVE ACCUMULATED IN THE BOREAL BECAUSE DECOMPOSITION IS LIMITED BY COLD TEMPERATURES AND OFTEN ANOXIC ENVIRONMENTS. INCREASES IN TEMPERATURES AND DISTURBANCE RATES COULD RESULT IN A LARGE NET C SOURCE DURING THE REMAINDER OF THIS CENTURY AND BEYOND. UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF GLOBAL CHANGE REMAIN HIGH, BUT WE EMPHASIZE THE ASYMMETRY OF RISK: SUSTAINED LARGE-SCALE INCREASES IN PRODUCTIVITY ARE UNLIKELY TO BE OF SUFFICIENT MAGNITUDE TO OFFSET HIGHER EMISSIONS FROM INCREASED DISTURBANCES AND HETEROTROPHIC RESPIRATION. REDUCING THE UNCERTAINTIES OF THE CURRENT AND FUTURE C BALANCE OF CANADA'S 270 MHA OF BOREAL FOREST REQUIRES ADDRESSING GAPS IN MONITORING, OBSERVATION, AND QUANTIFICATION OF FOREST C DYNAMICS, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO 125 MHA OF UNMANAGED BOREAL FOREST WITH EXTENSIVE AREAS OF DEEP ORGANIC SOILS, PEATLANDS, AND PERMAFROST CONTAINING LARGE QUANTITIES OF C THAT ARE VULNERABLE TO GLOBAL WARMING.;CARBON IN CANADA'S BOREAL FOREST - A SYNTHESIS;ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS;REVIEW;NA;2013;10.1139/er-2013-0041;ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES;WOS:000328470300004

BECAUSE SIBERIA IS LOCATED WHERE SOME OF THE LARGEST TEMPERATURE INCREASES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR UNDER CURRENT CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS, STORED CARBON HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE RELEASED WITH ASSOCIATED CHANGES IN FIRE REGIMES. OUR CONCENTRATION IS ON ESTIMATING A WIDE RANGE OF CURRENT AND POTENTIAL EMISSIONS FROM SIBERIA ON THE BASIS OF THREE MODELED SCENARIOS. AN AREA BURNED PRODUCT OF SIBERIA IS INTRODUCED, WHICH SPANS FROM 1998 THROUGH 2002. EMISSIONS MODELS ARE SPATIALLY EXPLICIT; THEREFORE AREA BURNED IS EXTRACTED FROM ASSOCIATED ECOREGIONS FOR EACH YEAR. CARBON CONSUMPTION ESTIMATES ARE PRESENTED FOR 23 UNIQUE ECOREGIONS ACROSS SIBERIA, WHICH RANGE FROM 3.4 TO 75.4 T C HA(-1) FOR THREE CLASSES OF SEVERITY. TOTAL DIRECT CARBON EMISSIONS RANGE FROM THE TRADITIONAL SCENARIO ESTIMATE OF 116 TG C IN 1999 (6.9 M HA BURNED) TO THE EXTREME SCENARIO ESTIMATE OF 520 TG C IN 2002 (11.2 M HA BURNED), WHICH ARE EQUIVALENT TO 5 AND 20%, RESPECTIVELY, OF TOTAL GLOBAL CARBON EMISSIONS FROM FOREST AND GRASSLAND BURNING. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT DISPARITIES IN THE AMOUNT OF CARBON STORED IN UNIQUE ECOSYSTEMS AND THE SEVERITY OF FIRE EVENTS CAN AFFECT TOTAL DIRECT CARBON EMISSIONS BY AS MUCH AS 50%. ADDITIONALLY, IN EXTREME FIRE YEARS, TOTAL DIRECT CARBON EMISSIONS CAN BE 37 - 41% GREATER THAN IN NORMAL FIRE YEARS, OWING TO INCREASED SOIL ORGANIC MATTER CONSUMPTION.

KING GM, 1997, GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL;KING GM;"SOILS CONSUME ABOUT 40 TG METHANE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE ANNUALLY. THUS, SOILS CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE ATMOSPHERIC METHANE BUDGET. HOWEVER, RESPONSES OF ATMOSPHERIC METHANE CONSUMPTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE ARE UNCERTAIN. PREDICTING THESE RESPONSES REQUIRES AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECT ON METHANE CONSUMPTION OF SPECIFIC VARIABLES (TEMPERATURE AND SOIL WATER CONTENT) AS WELL AS INTERACTIONS AMONG PARAMETERS (METHANE, AMMONIUM, WATER CONTENT). KEY CONSIDERATIONS INVOLVE THE LIMITATIONS OF DIFFUSIVE TRANSPORT AND CONTROLS OF METHANE DIFFUSIVITY; LIMITATION OF METHANOTROPHIC ACTIVITY BY WATER STRESS; RELATIVELY SLOW GROWTH RATES OF METHANE-OXIDIZING BACTERIA ON ATMOSPHERIC METHANE; AMMONIUM TOXICITY, INTERACTIONS AMONG THESE PARAMETERS MAY BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT, AND LEAD TO RESPONSES CONTRARY TO THOSE PREDICTED FROM CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE AND WATER CONTENT ALONE. RESULTS FROM A NUMBER OF ANALYSES INDICATE THAT ATMOSPHERIC METHANE CONSUMPTION IS ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES, WHICH TYPICALLY DECREASE ACTIVITY. CONTINUED INCREASES IN WET AND DRY AMMONIUM DEPOSITION ARE LIKELY TO EXACERBATE INHIBITION RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN LAND USE. CHANGES IN HYDROLOGICAL REGIMES COULD FURTHER DECREASE ACTIVITY IF DRY PERIODS INCREASE WATER STRESS AT SOIL DEPTHS CURRENTLY COLONIZED BY METHANOTROPHS.

A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE LITERATURE HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN WITH A FOCUS ON CATCHMENT DRIVERS OF DOM CHARACTER, REMOVAL OF DOM VIA COAGULATION AND THE FORMATION OF DISINFECTANT BY-PRODUCTS (DBPS). WE SUGGEST THAT: (1) UPLAND CATCHMENTS RECOVERING FROM ACIDIFICATION WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE MORE DOM WITH A GREATER HYDROPHOBIC FRACTION AS SOLUBILITY CONTROLS DECREASE; (2) GREATER SEASONALITY IN DOM EXPORT IS LIKELY IN FUTURE DUE TO ALTERED PRECIPITATION PATTERNS; (3) CHANGES IN SPECIES DIVERSITY AND WATER PROPERTIES COULD ENCOURAGE ALGAL BLOOMS; AND (4) THAT LAND MANAGEMENT AND VEGETATIVE CHANGES MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON DOM EXPORT AND TREATABILITY BUT REQUIRE FURTHER RESEARCH.

ELLISON JC, 2008, AQUAT BOT;ELLISON JC;MANGROVES ARE BIOGENIC SYSTEMS THAT ACCUMULATE SEDIMENTARY SEQUENCES, WHERE CORES CAN PROVIDE RECORDS OF MANGROVE SPECIES VARIATION IN DISTRIBUTION WITH PAST CLIMATE CHANGE AND SEA-LEVEL CHANGE. FOSSIL EVIDENCE USED FORPALAEOECOLOGICAL RECONSTRUCTION IS BASEDON ORGANIC REMAINS THAT PRESERVE IDENTIFYING FEATURES SO THAT THEY CAN BE IDENTIFIED TO GENERIC LEVELS AT LEAST. THIS INCLUDES MACROFOSSILS SUCH AS FRUIT, FLOWERS, WOOD OR LEAVES, OR MICROFOSSILS PARTICULARLY POLLEN. ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS IN MANGROVE SEDIMENT ALLOW THE LONG-TERM PRESERVATION OF THESE FOSSIL RECORDS. FOSSIL POLLEN FROM CORE SAMPLES IS CONCENTRATED FOR MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION BY USE OF STANDARD CHEMICAL TREATMENTS, BUT REFINEMENTS OF THESE ARE NECESSARY FOR THE PECULIARITIES OF MANGROVE PEAT. POLLEN DIAGRAMS ARE EXPRESSED IN CONCENTRATIONS, OR MORE USEFULLY IN MANGROVE ENVIRONMENT AS PROPORTIONS RELATIVE TO OTHERS, ITS THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO DEMONSTRATE THE DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT ACTUALLY UNDERNEATH THE MANGROVE FOREST. RADIOCARBON DATING OF SEDIMENTARY SEQUENCES IS USED TO DATE PALAEOECOLOGICAL SUCCESSIONS SHOWN BY FOSSIL SEQUENCES, OR LONG-TERM SEDIMENTATION RATES.

FROM POLLEN AND MACROFOSSILS MOSTLY RECOVERED FROM STRATIGRAPHIC CORES OF SEDIMENTARY ROCK AND MORE RECENT SEDIMENT, THE EVOLUTION AND DISPERSAL OF MANGROVES THROUGH GEOLOGICAL TIME HAS BEEN RECONSTRUCTED. WHILE RECONSTRUCTION OF ACTUAL TEMPERATURES IN THESE EARLIER RECORDS IS ASSOCIATIVE TO THE FOSSIL TYPES PRESENT, IT IS APPARENT THAT MANGROVES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TROPICAL SPECIES, EXTENDING TO HIGHER LATITUDES ONLY DURING GLOBAL WARM PERIODS. MANY SEDIMENTARY RECORDS SHOW MANGROVES DEEPER THAN THE PRESENT LOWER LIMIT OF MAN,,ROVE GROWTH AT MEAN SEA-LEVEL. THESE INDICATE SEA-LEVEL RISING OVER TIME, AND MANGROVES KEEPING PACE WITH RISING SEA-LEVEL. STRATIGRAPHIC DATING SHOWS ACCRETION RATES OF 1 MIN A(-1) FOR LOW ISLAND LOCATIONS, AND UP TO 1.5 MIN A(-1) IN HIGH ISLANDS/CONTINENTAL MARGINS. SEDIMENTARY RECORDS CAN ALSO SHOW DIE-OFF OF MANGROVES WITH MORE RAPID SEA-LEVEL RISE AND REPLACEMENT BY OPEN WATER DURING RISING SEA-LEVEL, LANDWARD RETREAT OF MANGROVE ZONES, OR REPLACEMENT OF MANGROVES BY FRESHWATER FOREST WITH SEDIMENTARY INFILL. THE CAUSES OF MANGROVE COMMUNITY CHANGES IDENTIFIED IN THE PALAEOCCOLOGICAL RECORD CAN ONLY BE INFERRED BY COMPARISON WITH ECOLOGICAL STUDIES IN THE MODERN ENVIRONMENT, THE LINK BETWEEN THE TWO THAT MAY BE POSSIBLE THROUGH LONG-TERM MANGROVE MONITORING BEING POORLY ESTABLISHED.

STRATIGRAPHIC RECORDS OF LAND-SURFACE PROCESSES AND VEGETATION CHANGE IN THE ARCTIC FOOTHILLS OF NORTHERN ALASKA REVEAL HOW TUNDRA LANDSCAPES RESPONDED TO CLIMATIC CHANGES BETWEEN 13,000 AND 8000 C-14 YR BP. PEAT DEPOSITION BEGAN AND SHRUB VEGETATION BECAME WIDESPREAD CA. 12,500 C-14 YR BP, PROBABLY IN RESPONSE TO THE ADVENT OF WARMER AND WETTER CLIMATE. INCREASED SLOPE EROSION CAUSED RAPID ALLUVIATION IN VALLEYS, AND POPULUS TREES SPREAD NORTHWARD ALONG BRAIDED FLOODPLAINS BEFORE 11,000 C-14 YR BP. LAKE LEVELS FELL AND STREAMS INCISED THEIR FLOODPLAINS DURING THE YOUNGER DRYAS (YD) (11,000-10,000 C-14 YR BP). A HIATUS IN RECORDS OF POPULUS SUGGEST THAT ITS GEOGRAPHIC RANGE CONTRACTED, AND POLLEN RECORDS OF OTHER SPECIES SUGGEST A COOLER AND DRIER CLIMATE DURING THIS INTERVAL. BASAL PEATS DATING TO THE YD ARE RARE, SUGGESTING THAT RATES OF PALUDIFICATION SLOWED. IMMEDIATELY AFTER 10,000 C-14 YR BP, LAKE LEVELS ROSE, STREAMS AGGRADED RAPIDLY AGAIN, INTENSE SOLIFLUCTION OCCURRED, AND POPULUS RE-INVADED THE AREA.

ALSO, UNLIKE MANY MORE INTENSIVELY STUDIED REGIONS OF EUROPE, HUMAN IMPACT IN THE REGION WAS RATHER LIMITED UNTIL THE 19TH CENTURY. WE PRESENT A 1200-YEAR HIGH-RESOLUTION RECORD FROM STAZKI MIRE, AN OMBROTROPHIC BOG LOCATED 35 KM FROM THE BALTIC SEA COAST. USING TESTATE AMOEBAE, STABLE ISOTOPES (DELTA C-13) OF SPHAGNUM STEMS, POLLEN, PLANT MACROFOSSILS AND DENDROECOLOGICAL ANALYSES, OUR AIMS WERE TO: 1) RECONSTRUCT THE LAST MILLENNIUM PALAEOENVIRONMENT IN THE STUDY SITE AND ITS SURROUNDINGS, 2) IDENTIFY THE MAJOR WET-DRY SHIFTS, 3) DETERMINE IF THOSE EVENTS CORRELATE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND HUMAN IMPACT, 4) ASSESS THE RESILIENCE OF THE BALTIC BOG ECOSYSTEM FOLLOWING HUMAN IMPACT, AND 5) COMPARE THE PALAEO-MOISTURE SIGNAL FROM THE BALTIC COAST WITH RECORDS FROM MORE OCEANIC REGIONS. TWO DRY PERIODS ARE INFERRED AT AD 1100-1500 AND 1650-1900 (-2005). THE FIRST DRY SHIFT IS PROBABLY CLIMATE-DRIVEN AS POLLEN RECORD SHOWS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF HUMAN INDICATORS. THE SECOND DRY SHIFT CAN BE RELATED TO LOCAL PEAT EXPLOITATION OF THE MIRE. IN THE 20TH CENTURY ADDITIONAL LIMITED DRAINAGE TOOK PLACE AND SINCE CA. AD 1950 THE MIRE HAS BEEN RECOVERING. FROM 1500 AD ONWARDS ALL PROXIES INDICATE WETTER CONDITION. THE BEGINNING OF THIS WET SHIFT OCCURRED DURING THE LITTLE ICE AGE AND MAY THEREFORE BE A CLIMATIC SIGNAL. THE MACROFOSSIL DATA SHOW THAT SPHAGNUM FUSCUM DOMINATED THE PRISTINE MIRE VEGETATION BUT THEN DECLINED AND FINALLY DISAPPEARED AT CA. AD 1900. THIS PATTERN IS COMPARABLE WITH THE TIMING OF EXTINCTION OF SPHAGNUM AUSTINII (-SPHAGNUM IMBRICATUM) IN THE UK.

JEFFERIES RL, 2010, SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM;"JEFFERIES RL;WALKER NA;EDWARDS KA;DAINTY J";DURING WINTER WHEN THE ACTIVE LAYER OF ARCTIC AND ALPINE SOILS IS BELOW 0 DEGREES C, SOIL MICROBES ARE ALIVE BUT METABOLIZING SLOWLY, PRESUMABLY IN CONTACT WITH UNFROZEN WATER. THIS UNFROZEN WATER IS AT THE SAME NEGATIVE CHEMICAL POTENTIAL AS THE ICE. WHILE BOTH THE HYDROSTATIC AND THE OSMOTIC COMPONENTS OF THE CHEMICAL POTENTIAL WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THIS NEGATIVE VALUE, WE ARGUE THAT THE OSMOTIC COMPONENT (OSMOTIC POTENTIAL) IS THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR. HENCE, THE SOIL MICROORGANISMS NEED TO BE AT LEAST HALOTOLERANT AND PSYCHROTOLERANT TO SURVIVE IN SEASONALLY FROZEN SOILS. THE LOW OSMOTIC POTENTIAL OF UNFROZEN SOIL WATER WILL LEAD TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF CELL WATER, UNLESS BALANCED BY ACCUMULATION OF COMPATIBLE SOLUTES. MANY MICROBES APPEAR TO SURVIVE THIS DEHYDRATION, SINCE MICROBIAL BIOMASS IN SOME SITUATIONS IS HIGH, AND RISING, IN WINTER. IN LATE WINTER HOWEVER, BEFORE THE SOIL TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE ZERO, THERE CAN BE A CONSIDERABLE DECLINE IN SOIL MICROBIAL BIOMASS DUE TO THE LOSS OF COMPATIBLE SOLUTES FROM VIABLE CELLS OR TO CELL RUPTURE. THIS DECLINE MAY BE CAUSED BY CHANGES IN THE PHYSICAL STATE OF THE SYSTEM, SPECIFICALLY BY SUDDEN FLUXES OF MELT WATER DOWN CHANNELS IN FROZEN SOIL, RAPIDLY RAISING THE CHEMICAL POTENTIAL. THE DEHYDRATED CELLS MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCOMMODATE A RAPID RISE IN OSMOTIC POTENTIAL SO THAT CELL MEMBRANES RUPTURE AND CELLS LYSE. THE EXHAUSTION OF SOLUBLE SUBSTRATES RELEASED FROM SENESCING PLANT AND MICROBIAL TISSUES IN AUTUMN AND WINTER MAY ALSO LIMIT MICROBIAL GROWTH, WHILE IN ADDITION THE RISING TEMPERATURES MAY TERMINATE A WINTER BLOOM OF PSYCHROPHILES. CLIMATE CHANGE IS PREDICTED TO CAUSE A DECLINE IN PLANT PRODUCTION IN THESE NORTHERN SOILS, DUE TO SUMMER DROUGHT AND TO AN INCREASE IN FREEZE-THAW CYCLES. BOTH OF THESE MAY BE EXPECTED TO REDUCE SOIL MICROBIAL BIOMASS IN LATE WINTER. AFTER LYSIS OF MICROBIAL CELLS THIS BIOMASS PROVIDES NUTRIENTS FOR PLANT GROWTH IN EARLY SPRING. THESE FEEDBACKS IN TURN, COULD AFFECT HERBIVORY AND PRODUCTION AT HIGHER TROPHIC LEVELS. (C) 2009 ELSEVIER LTD.

ALTHOUGH PAST INTERVALS OF WARMING WERE FORCED DIFFERENTLY THAN FUTURE ANTHROPOGENIC CHANGE, SUCH PERIODS CAN PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO POTENTIAL FUTURE CLIMATE IMPACTS AND ECOSYSTEM FEEDBACKS, ESPECIALLY OVER CENTENNIAL-TO-MILLENNIAL TIMESCALES THAT ARE OFTEN NOT COVERED BY CLIMATE MODEL SIMULATIONS. OUR OBSERVATION-BASED SYNTHESIS OF THE UNDERSTANDING OF PAST INTERVALS WITH TEMPERATURES WITHIN THE RANGE OF PROJECTED FUTURE WARMING SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS A LOW RISK OF RUNAWAY GREENHOUSE GAS FEEDBACKS FOR GLOBAL WARMING OF NO MORE THAN 2 DEGREES C. HOWEVER, SUBSTANTIAL REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS CAN OCCUR. A GLOBAL AVERAGE WARMING OF 1-2 DEGREES C WITH STRONG POLAR AMPLIFICATION HAS, IN THE PAST, BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY SIGNIFICANT SHIFTS IN CLIMATE ZONES AND THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF LAND AND OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS. SUSTAINED WARMING AT THIS LEVEL HAS ALSO LED TO SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS OF THE GREENLAND AND ANTARCTIC ICE SHEETS, WITH SEA-LEVEL INCREASES OF AT LEAST SEVERAL METRES ON MILLENNIAL TIMESCALES.

CRAWFORD RMM, 2000, NEW PHYTOL;CRAWFORD RMM;A CYCLIC BEHAVIOUR IN THE INTENSITY OF MARITIME CONDITIONS WHICH VARIES WITH THE PERIODIC BEHAVIOUR OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC OSCILLATION HAS RECENTLY BECAME APPARENT IN THE CLIMATIC RECORD OF NORTHERN EUROPE. PERIODIC INCREASES IN OCEANICITY ARE USUALLY VIEWED AS HAVING A POSITIVE EFFECT ON PLANT SURVIVAL, AS MILDER WINTERS, REDUCTION OF TEMPERATURE EXTREMES, LOW RISK OF EXPOSURE TO FROST, AND FREEDOM FROM DROUGHT REDUCE MANY ASPECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS. HOWEVER, WARMER WINTERS IN MARITIME ENVIRONMENTS MAY ALSO HAVE A POWERFUL INFLUENCE IN CREATING HABITATS THAT ARE UNFAVOURABLE FOR MANY SPECIES. THE DANGERS OF LONG PERIODS OF SOIL SATURATION FOR OVERWINTERING PLANTS, SOAKING INJURY TO GERMINATING SEEDS, PREMATURE BUD BURST IN SPRING, DEPRESSION OF TREELINES BY INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND HIGH LAPSE RATES, AS WELL AS THE CONSTANT LEACHING OF SOILS, ARE ALL NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF THE MARITIME ENVIRONMENT. WOODY SPECIES IN WHICH ROOT DORMANCY IS DELAYED BY MILD WINTERS ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF WINTER FLOODING. SUBSEQUENT RE-EXPOSURE TO OXYGEN AS WATER TABLES FALL IN SPRING CAN AGGRAVATE FLOODING DAMAGE THROUGH POST-ANOXIC INJURY, LEADING TO SEVERE DIEBACK OF ANCHORING ROOTS. SOIL LEACHING, PARTICULARLY AFTER HUMAN DISTURBANCE, CAN INDUCE NUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OLIGOTROPHIC COMMUNITIES WITH REDUCED PRODUCTIVITY. PODZOLIZATION AND IRON PAN FORMATION HAVE IN THE PAST FACILITATED THE PROCESSES OF PALUDIFICATION IN OCEANIC REGIONS. THE RESULTING SPREAD OF BOGS AND ACID MOORLANDS CAN FURTHER REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR PRODUCTIVITY IN BOTH AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL PLANT COMMUNITIES.

METHODS: WE DEVELOPED A BOG ECOSYSTEM MODEL THAT INCLUDES VEGETATION, CARBON, NITROGEN AND WATER DYNAMICS. TWO GROUPS OF VASCULAR PLANT SPECIES AND THREE GROUPS OF SPHAGNUM SPECIES COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER FOR LIGHT AND NITROGEN. THE MODEL WAS TESTED BY COMPARING THE OUTCOME WITH LONG-TERM HISTORIC VEGETATION CHANGES IN PEAT CORES FROM DENMARK AND ENGLAND. A CLIMATE SCENARIO WAS USED TO ANALYSE THE FUTURE EFFECTS OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2, TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION. RESULTS: THE MAIN CHANGES IN THE SPECIES COMPOSITION SINCE 1766 WERE SIMULATED BY THE MODEL. SIMULATIONS FOR A FUTURE WARMER, AND SLIGHTLY WETTER, CLIMATE WITH DOUBLING CO2 CONCENTRATION SUGGEST THAT LITTLE WILL CHANGE IN SPECIES COMPOSITION, DUE TO THE CONTRASTING EFFECTS OF INCREASING TEMPERATURES ( FAVOURING VASCULAR PLANTS) AND CO2 ( FAVOURING SPHAGNUM). FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE SHOWED THAT SIMULATED CARBON SEQUESTRATION IS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO VASCULAR PLANT EXPANSION. MODEL RESULTS SHOW THAT INCREASING TEMPERATURES MAY STILL INCREASE CARBON ACCUMULATION AT COOL, LOW N DEPOSITION SITES, BUT DECREASE CARBON ACCUMULATION AT HIGH N DEPOSITION SITES. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, N-DEPOSITION AND ATMOSPHERIC CO2 ARE NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD, BUT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THESE COMPONENTS OF GLOBAL CHANGE EXIST. THESE INTERACTIONS ARE THE RESULT OF CHANGES IN VEGETATION COMPOSITION.

HOWEVER, CLOSER EXAMINATION OF THE TUNDRA-TAIGA INTERFACE ACROSS ITS CIRCUMPOLAR EXTENT REVEALS A MORE COMPLEX SITUATION.

INVESTIGATIONS REVEAL CONSIDERABLE STABILITY AT PRESENT IN THE POSITION OF THE TREELINE AND WHILE THERE MAY BE A LONG-TERM ADVANCE NORTHWARDS THERE ARE OCEANIC REGIONS WHERE CLIMATIC WARMING MAY RESULT IN A RETREAT SOUTHWARDS DUE TO INCREASED BOG DEVELOPMENT. REINFORCING THIS TREND IS AN INCREASING HUMAN IMPACT, PARTICULARLY IN THE FOREST TUNDRA OF RUSSIA, WHICH FORCES THE LIMIT OF THE FORESTED AREAS SOUTHWARDS.

HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT OF UNDISTURBED PEATLANDS, AS WELL AS THE RESTORATION OF DISTURBED PEATLANDS, WILL ALTER THE EXCHANGE OF CH4 WITH THE ATMOSPHERE. THE AIM OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS WAS TO COLLATE AND ANALYZE PUBLISHED STUDIES TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS THAT CONTROL CH4 EMISSIONS AND THE IMPACTS OF MANAGEMENT ON THE GAS FLUX FROM NORTHERN (LATITUDE 40 DEGREES TO 70 DEGREES N) PEATLANDS. THE ANALYSIS INCLUDES A TOTAL OF 87 STUDIES REPORTING MEASUREMENTS OF CH4 EMISSIONS TAKEN AT 186 SITES COVERING DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, PEATLAND TYPES, AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. RESULTS SHOW THAT CH4 EMISSIONS FROM NATURAL NORTHERN PEATLANDS ARE HIGHLY VARIABLE WITH A 95% CI OF 7.6-15.7 G C M(-2) YEAR(-1) FOR THE MEAN AND 3.3-6.3 G C M(-2) YEAR(-1) FOR THE MEDIAN. THE OVERALL ANNUAL AVERAGE (MEAN +/- SD) IS 12 +/- 21 G C M(-2) YEAR(-1) WITH THE HIGHEST EMISSIONS FROM FEN ECOSYSTEMS. METHANE EMISSIONS FROM NATURAL PEATLANDS ARE MAINLY CONTROLLED BY WATER TABLE (WT) DEPTH, PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, AND SOIL PH. ALTHOUGH MEAN ANNUAL AIR TEMPERATURE IS NOT A GOOD PREDICTOR OF CH4 EMISSIONS BY ITSELF, THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TEMPERATURE, PLANT COMMUNITY COVER, WT DEPTH, AND SOIL PH IS IMPORTANT. ACCORDING TO SHORT-TERM FORECASTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, THESE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS WILL BE THE MAIN DETERMINANT OF CH4 EMISSIONS FROM NORTHERN PEATLANDS. DRAINAGE SIGNIFICANTLY (P < .05) REDUCES CH4 EMISSIONS TO THE ATMOSPHERE, ON AVERAGE BY 84%. RESTORATION OF DRAINED PEATLANDS BY REWETTING OR VEGETATION/REWETTING INCREASES CH4 EMISSIONS ON AVERAGE BY 46% COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL PREMANAGEMENT CH4 FLUXES.

THE DELTA O-18 VALUES OF NATURAL GOETHITES RANGE FROM -15.5 PARTS PER THOUSAND TO +3.3 PARTS PER THOUSAND, WHEREAS DELTA O-18 VALUES OF LOW-TEMPERATURE HEMATITES RANGE FROM -16.7 PARTS PER THOUSAND TO +4.7 PARTS PER THOUSAND. PLOTS OF SD AGAINST DELTA O-18 FOR CONTINENTAL GOETHITES ARE APPROXIMATELY PARALLEL TO THE METEORIC WATER LINE OF CRAIG (H CRAIG. 1961. SCIENCE 133:1702-3). THIS SUGGESTS THAT GOETHITE-WATER FRACTIONATION FACTORS ARE SYSTEMATIC OVER A WIDE RANGE OF SURFICIAL ENVIRONMENTS AND MAY INDICATE THAT ISOTOPIC EQUILIBRIUM IS COMMONLY ATTAINED OR CLOSELY APPROACHED. SEVERAL EXPERIMENTAL OR CALCULATED MINERAL-WATER, OXYGEN ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION CURVES HAVE BEEN DETERMINED FOR BOTH GOETHITE AND HEMATITE. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NOT YET A CONSENSUS ON WHICH OF THESE CURVES BEST APPROXIMATES ISOTOPIC FRACTIONATION IN NATURAL SAMPLES, OXYGEN ISOTOPE MEASUREMENTS OF BOTH GOETHITE AND HEMATITE HAVE PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF SIGNIFICANT CONTINENTAL CLIMATE CHANGE ON TIME SCALES THAT RANGE FROM THOUSANDS TO MILLIONS OF YEARS. THE CONCENTRATION AND DELTA C-13 VALUES OF AN FE(CO3)OH COMPONENT IN APPARENT SOLID SOLUTION IN GOETHITE ARE PROXIES FOR THE PARTIAL PRESSURE AND DELTA C-13 VALUES, RESPECTIVELY, OF COL IN THE ENVIRONMENT AT THE TIME OF GOETHITE CRYSTALLIZATION.

WHITE JR, 2008, J GEOPHYS RES-BIOGEO;"WHITE JR;SHANNON RD;WELTZIN JF;PASTOR J;BRIDGHAM SD";BOREAL PEATLANDS CONTAIN A LARGE PORTION OF THE EARTH'S TERRESTRIAL ORGANIC CARBON AND MAY BE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO CHANGES IN CLIMATE. TEMPERATURES IN BOREAL REGIONS ARE PREDICTED TO INCREASE DURING THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY WHICH MAY ACCELERATE CHANGES IN SOIL MICROBIAL PROCESSES AND PLANT COMMUNITY DYNAMICS. IN PARTICULAR, CLIMATE-DRIVEN CHANGES IN PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION MIGHT AFFECT THE PATHWAYS AND RATES OF METHANOGENESIS, THE PLANT-MEDIATED EMISSION OF METHANE, AND THE SCAVENGING OF METHANE BY METHANOTROPHIC BACTERIA. CLIMATE CHANGE MAY ALSO AFFECT METHANE CYCLING THROUGH CHANGES IN PORE WATER CHEMISTRY. TO DATE, THESE FEEDBACKS HAVE NOT BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE CARBON CYCLING COMPONENTS OF CLIMATE MODELS. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF SOIL WARMING AND WATER TABLE MANIPULATIONS ON METHANE CYCLING IN A FIELD MESOCOSM EXPERIMENT IN NORTHERN MINNESOTA, USA. LARGE INTACT SOIL MONOLITHS REMOVED FROM A BOG AND FEN RECEIVED INFRARED WARMING TREATMENTS CROSSED WITH WATER TABLE TREATMENTS FOR 6 YEARS. IN YEARS 5 AND 6, CONCENTRATIONS, FLUXES, AND ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS OF METHANE WERE MEASURED ALONG WITH ABOVEGROUND AND BELOWGROUND NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY AND PORE WATER CONCENTRATIONS OF ACETATE, SULFATE, AMMONIUM, NITRATE, AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON. WATER TABLE LEVEL WAS THE DOMINANT CONTROL OVER METHANE FLUX IN THE FEN MESOCOSMS, LIKELY THROUGH ITS EFFECT ON METHANE OXIDATION RATES. HOWEVER, PORE WATER CHEMISTRY AND PLANT PRODUCTIVITY WERE IMPORTANT SECONDARY FACTORS IN EXPLAINING METHANE FLUX IN THE FEN MESOCOSMS, AND THESE FACTORS APPEARED TO BE THE PREDOMINANT CONTROLS OVER METHANE FLUX IN THE BOG MESOCOSMS. THE WATER TABLE AND IR TREATMENTS HAD LARGE EFFECTS ON PORE WATER CHEMISTRY AND PLANT PRODUCTIVITY, SO THE INDIRECT EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE APPEAR TO BE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF CHANGING TEMPERATURE AND WATER TABLE LEVEL IN CONTROLLING FUTURE METHANE FLUXES FROM NORTHERN PEATLANDS. PORE WATER SULFATE, AMMONIUM, NITRATE, AND ACETATE HAD A RELATIVELY CONSISTENT NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH METHANE EMISSIONS, PORE WATER DOC HAD A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH METHANE EMISSIONS, AND BNPP HAD MIXED EFFECTS. THE BOG MESOCOSMS HAD MUCH HIGHER METHANE EMISSIONS AND PORE WATER METHANE CONCENTRATIONS THAN THE FEN MESOCOSMS, DESPITE A MUCH LOWER AVERAGE WATER TABLE LEVEL AND PEAT THAT IS A POOR SUBSTRATE FOR METHANOGENESIS. WE SUGGEST THAT THE RELATIVELY HIGH METHANE FLUXES IN THE BOG MESOCOSMS CAN BE EXPLAINED THROUGH THEIR LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF INHIBITORY PORE WATER COMPOUNDS, HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF DOC, AND HIGH PLANT PRODUCTIVITY. STABLE ISOTOPIC DATA FROM PORE WATER SUPPORT ACETATE FERMENTATION AS THE PRINCIPAL PATHWAY OF METHANOGENESIS IN BOG MESOCOSMS (MEAN DELTA(13) CH4 = -41.0%, MEAN DELTA D-CH4 = -190%). FEN MESOCOSMS HAD LOWER PORE WATER CONCENTRATIONS AND EMISSIONS OF METHANE THAN BOG MESOCOSMS, DESPITE MUCH HIGHER METHANE PRODUCTION POTENTIALS IN FEN PEAT. THE METHANE FROM THE FEN MESOCOSMS WAS ISOTOPICALLY HEAVY (MEAN DELTA(CH4)-C-13 = -28.9%, MEAN DELTA D-CH4 = -140%), SUGGESTING A STRONG OXIDATIVE SINK. THIS IS LIKELY RELATED TO THE DOMINANCE OF GRAMINOID VEGETATION AND THE ASSOCIATED OXYGEN TRANSPORT INTO THE RHIZOSPHERE.

THEY ARE BASED ON DATA FROM POLLEN ANALYSES OF LAKES AND PEAT-BOGS, PLANT MACROFOSSILS, ARCHAEOBOTANICAL FINDS AND RADIOCARBON DATING. DURING THE EARLY HOLOCENE, AFTER 7900 CAL. B.P. (5950 CAL. B.C.) THE CLIMATE CHANGED TO COOLER SUMMERS, MILDER WINTERS AND HIGHER PRECIPITATION RESULTING IN THE FORMATION OF A CONIFEROUS BELT DOMINATED BY PINUS SP. AND ABIES ALBA. THESE FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENTAL PRE-CONDITIONS HAD A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON THE NEOLITHISATION OF THE BALKANS AFTER THE 8200 CAL. B.P. (6250 CAL. B.C.) COLD EVENT, WHICH CAUSED DROUGHT IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN. DIRECT EVIDENCE FROM WOOD CHARCOAL RECORDS FROM THE NEOLITHIC SETTLEMENT LAYERS IN THE STUDY AREA SHOWS A SLIGHT MODIFICATION OF THE SURROUNDING WOODLANDS AND AN INCREASE OF THE LIGHT-DEMANDING COMPONENTS, PROBABLY EXPRESSED THROUGH LARGER FOREST BORDER ZONES AND THINNING OUT OF THE WOOD STANDS. THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SETTLEMENTS IN THE VALLEYS OF SOUTHWESTERN BULGARIA INTENSIFIED THE HUMAN ACTIVITY VISIBLE IN THE PALAEOBOTANICAL RECORD FROM 6950 CAL. B.P. (5000 CAL. B.C.) ONWARDS. BETWEEN CA. 5700-5100 CAL. B.P. (3800-3200 CAL. B.C.) SIGNS OF ANTHROPOGENIC INFLUENCE ON THE VEGETATION ARE VIRTUALLY ABSENT. THE INTENSITY OF HUMAN IMPACT INCREASED NOTABLY AFTER 3200 CAL. B.P.

WEBSTER KL, 2015, ENVIRON REV;"WEBSTER KL;BEALL FD;CREED IF;KREUTZWEISER DP";INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT WITHIN CANADA'S BOREAL ZONE HAS INCREASED IN RECENT DECADES. FOREST MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, PULP AND PAPER OPERATIONS, ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION, MINING, CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION, NONCONVENTIONAL OIL SAND DEVELOPMENT, AND PEAT MINING OCCUR THROUGHOUT THE BOREAL ZONE WITH VARYING IMPACTS ON WATER RESOURCES. WE REVIEW IMPACTS OF THESE INDUSTRIES ON SURFACE WATER, GROUNDWATER, AND WETLANDS RECOGNIZING THAT HETEROGENEITY IN THE DOMINANCE OF DIFFERENT HYDROLOGIC PROCESSES (I.E., PRECIPITATION, EVAPOTRANSPIRATION, GROUNDWATER RECHARGE, AND RUNOFF GENERATION) ACROSS THE BOREAL ZONE INFLUENCES THE DEGREE OF IMPACTS ON WATER RESOURCES. THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, FOREST CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS, AND SCIENCE-BASED GUIDELINES, TIMBER, PULP AND PAPER, AND PEAT INDUSTRIES HAVE REDUCED THEIR IMPACTS ON WATER RESOURCES, ALTHOUGH UNCERTAINTIES REMAIN ABOUT LONG-TERM RECOVERY FOLLOWING DISTURBANCE. HYDROELECTRIC POWER DEVELOPMENTS HAVE MOVED TOWARD REDUCING RESERVOIR SIZE AND CREATING MORE NATURAL FLOW REGIMES, ALTHOUGH IMPACTS OF AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND DAM DECOMMISSIONING IS LARGELY UNKNOWN. MINERAL AND METAL MINING INDUSTRIES HAVE IMPROVED REGULATION AND PRACTICES, BUT THE LEGACY OF ABANDONED MINES ACROSS THE BOREAL ZONE STILL PRESENTS AN ONGOING RISK TO WATER RESOURCES. OIL AND GAS INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING NON-CONVENTIONAL RESOURCES SUCH AS OIL SANDS, IS ONE OF THE LARGEST INDUSTRIAL USERS OF WATER AND, WHILE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN REDUCING WATER USE, MORE WORK IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF WATER RESOURCES. ALL INDUSTRIES CONTRIBUTE TO ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION OF POLLUTANTS THAT MAY EVENTUALLY BE RELEASED TO DOWNSTREAM WATERS. ALTHOUGH MOST INDUSTRIAL SECTORS STRIVE TO IMPROVE THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE WITH REGARDS TO WATER RESOURCES, DISRUPTIONS TO NATURAL FLOW REGIMES AND RISKS OF DEGRADED WATER QUALITY EXIST AT LOCAL TO REGIONAL SCALES IN THE BOREAL ZONE.

EMERGING REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES BASED ON A GROWING ARRAY OF SATELLITE AND AIRBORNE PLATFORMS THAT COVER A WIDE RANGE OF SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES INCREASINGLY ALLOW ROBUST DETECTION OF CHANGES IN PERMAFROST LANDSCAPES. IN THIS REVIEW, WE SUMMARISE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (2010-15) IN REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS TO DETECT AND MONITOR LANDSCAPE CHANGES INVOLVING SURFACE TEMPERATURES, SNOW COVER, TOPOGRAPHY, SURFACE WATER, VEGETATION COVER AND STRUCTURE, AND DISTURBANCES FROM FIRE AND HUMAN ACTIVITIES.

HE XL, 2016, PERSPECT PLANT ECOL;"HE XL;HE KS;HYVONEN J";"UNDERSTANDING HOW PLANT SPECIES RESPOND TO CLIMATE CHANGE IS ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES IN BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABLE ECOSYSTEM PLANNING. CURRENT STUDIES OF THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON PLANTS ARE BIASED TO TRACHEOPHYTES, I.E. VASCULAR-PLANTS. ONLY A FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT ON BRYOPHYTES DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ECOLOGICALLY EQUALLY IMPORTANT GROUPS OF EMBRYOPHYTES WITH THEIR ORIGINS PREDATING CONTEMPORARY VASCULAR-PLANTS. BRYOPHYTES FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFER FROM VASCULAR PLANTS IN THEIR SMALL SIZE AND UTILIZATION OF A POIKILOHYDRIC STRATEGY FOR WATER AND NUTRIENTS; THEIR SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THEIR EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. THUS, THE RESULTS FROM STUDIES OF TRACHEOPHYTES CANNOT BE GENERALIZED ON BRYOPHYTES. IN THIS REVIEW, WE SYNTHESIZE INFORMATION ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ON BRYOPHYTES TO UNDERSTAND THEIR RELATION TO CLIMATE, ESPECIALLY TO TEMPERATURE ON A GLOBAL SCALE. WE DISCUSS A RANGE OF CRITICAL TOPICS, INCLUDING THE RESPONSES OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACTIVITIES TO TEMPERATURE CHANGES, AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPERATURE CHANGE ON THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN BRYOPHYTES AND VASCULAR-PLANTS, AS WELL AS ON PEATLAND ECOSYSTEMS. AS MANY SPECIES THRIVE IN RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURES, WITH A LOW POTENTIAL FOR SHORT-TERM THERMAL ACCLIMATION TO HIGHER TEMPERATURE IN A HYDRATED STATE, ELEVATED TEMPERATURES MAY SHORTEN THE TIME OF METABOLIC ACTIVITY, AND INCREASE DESICCATION INTENSITY. THIS CAN BRING SIGNIFICANT PHYSIOLOGICAL PRESSURE ON THE SURVIVAL OF POIKILOHYDRIC BRYOPHYTES. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF GLOBAL WARMING, SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN BRYOPHYTE DIVERSITY CAN BE EXPECTED, PARTICULARLY IN AREAS HARBOURING LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIES SUCH AS BOREAL FORESTS OF HIGHER LATITUDES, ALPINE BIOMES AND HIGHER ALTITUDES ON TROPICAL MOUNTAINS. FURTHERMORE, THE DECLINE OF BRYOPHYTE DIVERSITY WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO AN ALTERATION OF ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION, NUTRIENT CYCLING, AND CARBON BALANCE. FURTHER EXPLORATION OF BRYOPHYTE ECOPHYSIOLOGY IN THE CHANGING ENVIRONMENT, PARTICULARLY THE ACCLIMATION POTENTIAL OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND ITS BIOCHEMICAL AND ENZYME LEVEL BASIS TO PREDICTED CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE WILL PROVIDE NEW KNOWLEDGE THAT WILL ASSIST BRYOPHYTE CONSERVATION.

PAYNE R, 2008, QUATERNARY SCI REV;"PAYNE R;BLACKFORD J";DESPITE THE FACT THAT VOLCANIC ASH (TEPHRA) LAYERS ARE FOUND PRESERVED IN PEAT DEPOSITS AROUND THE WORLD, COMPARATIVELY LITTLE RESEARCH HAS INVESTIGATED THE IMPACTS OF DISTAL VOLCANIC EMISSIONS ON PEATLANDS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE IMPACTS OF SEVERAL LATE-HOLOCENE VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS ON FIVE PEATLANDS IN SOUTHERN ALASKA USING A PALAEOECOLOGICAL APPROACH. TESTATE AMOEBAE ANALYSIS, PEAT HUMIFICATION ANALYSIS AND A BASIC ANALYSIS OF PLANT MACROFOSSIL COMPONENTS WERE APPLIED ACROSS 11 TEPHRA LAYERS. CHANGES IN MACROFOSSIL AND TESTATE AMOEBAE ASSEMBLAGES OCCUR ACROSS SEVERAL OF THE TEPHRA LAYERS. THE HUMIFICATION RESULTS WERE CONSIDERED UNRELIABLE BECAUSE OF A METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEM, A FINDING WHICH MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR OTHER STUDIES USING THIS TECHNIQUE. REDUNDANCY ANALYSES ON TESTATE AMOEBAE DATA SHOW STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH TWO TEPHRAS. THE MOST LIKELY CAUSES OF THE IMPACTS ARE VOLCANIC GASES, ACIDIC PRECIPITATION OR TEPHRA-DERIVED LEACHATES. THE FINDING THAT SOME TEPHRAS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPACTS WHEREAS OTHERS ARE NOT MAY RELATE TO THE SEASON OF THE ERUPTION OR METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF ASH FALL. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THE SENSITIVITY OF PEATLANDS AND PEATLAND MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES TO DISTAL VOLCANIC PRODUCTS AND IMPLY THAT CHANGES IN KEY PALAEOCLIMATIC PROXIES MAY BE CAUSED BY A MECHANISM INDEPENDENT OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

PEATLAND DEVELOPMENT AND THE ASSOCIATED CARBON ACCUMULATION, WHICH ARE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY HYDROLOGICAL FLUCTUATIONS, ARE ALSO OF PRIME IMPORTANCE AS PEATLANDS REPRESENT LONG-TERM SINKS OF ATMOSPHERIC CARBON. IMPROVED KNOWLEDGE OF PEATLAND DEVELOPMENT AND SOIL MOISTURE VARIABILITY DURING THE HOLOCENE IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF LONG-TERM HYDROCLIMATE CHANGES, THE TERRESTRIAL CARBON CYCLE, AND TO ENABLE MORE ROBUST PREDICTIONS OF PEATLAND RESPONSE TO FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGES. HERE, WE REVIEW THE EXISTING MID- TO LATE HOLOCENE PEATLAND TREE-RING CHRONOLOGIES THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO STUDY CLIMATE VARIABILITY ON (SUB-)ANNUAL TO CENTENNIAL SCALES WITH A PRIMARY FOCUS ON NORTHERN EUROPE. SINCE THE 1970S, ABSOLUTELY DATED TREE-RING CHRONOLOGIES COVERING SUBSTANTIAL PARTS OF THE HOLOCENE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FROM EXCAVATED REMAINS OF OAK (QUERCUS SPP.) AND PINE (PINUS SYLVESTRIS L). THE ANNUAL TREE-RING PATTERNS OF THESE TREES ARE OFTEN CHARACTERIZED BY PERIODS OF DEPRESSED GROWTH REFLECTING ANNUAL TO DECADAL HYDROCLIMATIC CHANGES. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN THE SPATIO-TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF TREES THROUGHOUT THE HOLOCENE ARE OFTEN FOUND TO REFLECT DECADAL TO CENTENNIAL CLIMATE AND HYDROLOGICAL CHANGES. MOREOVER, SYNCHRONICITY BETWEEN TREE-RING CHRONOLOGIES AND TREE-POPULATION DYNAMICS OVER LARGER GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS SHOW PERIODS OF COHERENT REGIONAL CLIMATE FORCING, ESPECIALLY DURING THE MID-HOLOCENE. THIS REVIEW (I) PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF PIONEERING AND RECENT STUDIES PRESENTING TREE-RING CHRONOLOGIES DEVELOPED FROM SUBFOSSIL PEATLAND TREES, AND (II) PRESENTS RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FIELDS OF DENDROECOLOGY (I.E. THE RESPONSE OF TREE GROWTH AND CHANGES IN VITALITY AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN CLIMATIC VARIABLES) AND DENDROCLIMATOLOGY (I.E.

WITH THIS AIM, WE HAVE COLLECTED PUBLISHED STUDIES WHERE LONG SERIES OF ORGANIC CARBON CONCENTRATIONS (I.E., LONGER THAN 10 YEARS) WERE ANALYZED FOR EXISTING TRENDS AND HAVE CAREFULLY EVALUATED THE 63 ARTICLES FOUND. INFORMATION HAS BEEN COLLATED IN A COMPREHENSIVE AND COMPARABLE WAY, ALLOWING READERS TO EASILY ACCESS IT. THE TWO MAIN ASPECTS CONSIDERED IN OUR ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN THE ANALYTICAL METHODS USED AND THE DATA TREATMENT METHODS APPLIED. BOTH ARE SENSITIVE ISSUES BECAUSE, ON THE ONE HAND, THE DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH CORRECTLY DETERMINING ORGANIC CARBON CONCENTRATIONS IN SURFACE WATERS ARE WELL KNOWN, WHILE, ON THE OTHER, DEALING WITH REAL ENVIRONMENTAL DATA (I.E., LACK OF NORMALITY, CENSORING, MISSING VALUES, ETC.)

THE STUDY AREA IS LOCATED IN A MOUNTAINOUS HIGH ANDEAN ENVIRONMENT, BETWEEN 3200 AND 5300 IN OF ELEVATION, UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF TROPICAL XERIC TO PLUVISEASONAL BIOCLIMATES, WITH SUMMER RAINFALL. SIXTY-SIX PHYTOSOCIOLOGICAL RELEVES WERE PERFORMED IN THE FIELD AND WERE ANALYZED BY TABULAR COMPARISON USING ADDITIONAL ALREADY PUBLISHED RELEVES. FOUR PHYTOSOCIOLOGICAL CLASSES INCLUDE ALL ZONAL VEGETATION OF THE STUDY AREA: PARA-STREPHIO LEPIDOPHYLLAE-FABIANETEA DENSAE, SUPRATROPICAL, OROTROPICAL AND CRYORO-TROPICAL DWARF-SCRUBS AND GRASSLANDS; POLYLEPIDETEA TARAPACANO-BESSERI, OROTROPICAL POLYLEPIS FORESTS; ANTHOCHLOO LEPIDULAE-DIELSIOCHLOETEA FLORIBUNDAE, CRYOROTROPICAL VEGETATION OF ROCKY AND SOLIFLUXIONAL SOILS. SUPRATROPICAL DESERT SCRUBS OF THE ALLIANCE AMBROSIO ARTEMISIOLDIS-ATRIPLICION IMBRICATAE, ARE INCLUDED IN THE NEW ORDER ATRIPLICETALIA IMBRICATAE OF THE CLASS OPUNTIETEA SPHAERICAE. AZONAL VEGETATION IS INCLUDED INTO THE CLASSES PLANTAGINI RIGIDAE-DISTICHIETEA MUSCOLDIS (HIGH ANDEAN MIRES AND BOGS), POTAMOGETONETEA (SUBMERGED VEGETATION) AND LEMNETEA MINORIS (FLOATING PLANT COMMUNITIES). FOURTEEN ASSOCIATIONS WERE RECOGNIZED, FIVE OF WHICH ARE NEW (OREOCEREO IEUCOTRICHI-AMBROSIETUM ARTEMISIOIDIS, LOPHOPAPPETURN TARAPACANI, DIPLOSTEPHIO MEYENII-FABIANETUM RAMULOSAE, WERNERIO ARETIOIDIS-PARASTREPHIETUM LUCIDAE AND SENECIONI ZOELLNERI-AZORELLETUM COMPACTAE) AND ONE IS PROPOSED AS PROVISIONAL (DEYEUXIO CURVULAE-WERNERIETUM INCISAE). ONE NEW ALLIANCE (DIPLOSTEPHIO MEYENII-FABIANION RAMULOSAE) AND ONE PROVISIONAL ALLIANCE (SENECIONION ZOELLNERI-SCORZONERAEFOLII) ARE DESCRIBED, DISCUSSING THEIR SYNTAXONOMY ON THE BASIS OF 1115 RELEVES ALREADY PUBLISHED FOR THE INVOLVED CLASSES, INCLUDING THE RELEVES PUBLISHED HERE. FOUR VEGETATION BELTS WERE RECOGNIZED ACCORDING TO THE ALTITUDINAL VARIATION OF THE VEGETATION PHYSIOGNOMY, FLORISTIC COMPOSITION AND BIOCLIMATE. CLIMATIC INFLUENCES OF THE TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY ON THE ALTITUDINAL ZONATION OF VEGETATION BELTS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF TROPICAL HIGH ANDES. TWO MAIN FLORISTIC ELEMENTS CAN BE DISTINGUISHED IN THE PARINACOTA PROVINCE: PACIFIC DESERT AND PUNA. THE FIRST ONE IS THE MORE IMPORTANT COMPONENT AT LOW ALTITUDE, DECREASING ITS PARTICIPATION IN HIGHER ELEVATION HABITATS, WHERE THE SECOND BECOMES DOMINANT. THE ORIGIN OF THESE ELEMENTS IS DISCUSSED ON THE BASIS OF PALEOECOLOGICAL DATA: THE PACIFIC DESERT ELEMENT SEEMS TO BE MAINLY ASSOCIATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARIDITY IN THE WESTERN SLOPE OF THE ANDES SINCE THE MIOCENE, WHILE THE PUNA ELEMENT APPEARS TO BE ORIGINATED DUE TO THE RAISE OF THE ANDES DURING THE PLIO-PLETSTOCENE.

LONG-TERM MONITORING PROGRAMMES PROVIDE SOME RECORDS OF THE RATE OF RECENT CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT MOSS PEAT BANKS CONTAIN AN UNRIVALLED TEMPORAL RECORD OF PAST CLIMATE CHANGE ON TERRESTRIAL PLANT ANTARCTIC SYSTEMS. WE SUMMARISE THE CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF CLIMATIC PROXIES AND DETERMINANTS OF MOSS GROWTH FOR CONTRASTING CONTINENTAL AND MARITIME ANTARCTIC REGIONS, AS INFORMED BY 13C AND 18O SIGNALS IN ORGANIC MATERIAL. RATES OF MOSS ACCUMULATION ARE MORE THAN THREE TIMES HIGHER IN THE MARITIME ANTARCTIC THAN CONTINENTAL ANTARCTICA WITH GROWING SEASON LENGTH BEING A CRITICAL DETERMINANT OF GROWTH RATE, AND HIGH CARBON ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION VALUES REFLECTING OPTIMAL HYDRATION CONDITIONS. CORRELATION PLOTS OF 13C AND 18O VALUES SHOW THAT SPECIES (CHORISODONTIUM ACIPHYLLUM / POLYTRICHUM STRICTUM) AND GROWTH FORM (HUMMOCK / BANK) ARE THE MAJOR DETERMINANTS OF MEASURED ISOTOPE RATIOS. THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN MOSS GROWTH FORM, PHOTOSYNTHETIC PHYSIOLOGY, WATER STATUS AND ISOTOPE COMPOSITION ARE COMPARED WITH DEVELOPMENTS OF SECONDARY PROXIES, SUCH AS CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE.

THESE DRIVERS INCLUDED POLLEN-INFERRED MEAN JULY AIR TEMPERATURE, VEGETATION COVER AS POLLEN PERCENTAGES, DIATOM-INFERRED WATER PH AND TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON (TOC), AND SEDIMENT PROPERTIES AS LOSS ON IGINITION (LOI). VARIANCE PARTITIONING SHOWED THAT ON THE HOLOCENE TIMESCALE, CHIRONOMID ASSEMBLAGES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY RESPONDING TO CHANGES IN BETULA PERCENTAGES. THIS IS EXPLAINED BY THE CO-OCCURRING RESPONSE OF CHIRONOMIDS TO THE HOLOCENE CLIMATIC DEVELOPMENT, WHICH HAS ALSO BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF VEGETATION IN THE CATCHMENT. HOWEVER, DURING THE VERY EARLY HOLOCENE PERIOD FROM 10 500 CAL. YR BP TO 8300 CAL. YR BP CHIRONOMIDS WERE RESPONDING MORE DIRECTLY TO THE CHANGES IN WATER QUALITY, IE, PH. DURING THE LATTER PART OF THE HOLOCENE, NO ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLE APPEARED TO BE SIGNIFICANT IN EXPLAINING THE VARIATION IN CHIRONOMID ASSEMBLAGES. THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE UNDERESTIMATION OF THE ACTUAL WATER TOC BY THE DIATOM-BASED TOC MODEL. HOWEVER, FOR THE LATTER PART OF THE HOLOCENE, FROM 5000 CAL. YR BP TO THE PRESENT, THE IMPORTANCE OF LIMNOLOGICAL CHANGES ATTRIBUTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MARGINAL MIRES ON THE MIDGES IS EVIDENT. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT FACTORS OTHER THAN CLIMATE MAY HAVE HAD MORE DIRECT INFLUENCE ON THE CHIRONOMID ABUNDANCES AT CERTAIN TIME PERIODS.

SMITH VR, 2008, POLAR REC;SMITH VR;THIS ARTICLE IS A SEQUEL TO A WORD-MODEL DESCRIPTION OF THE ECOSYSTEM OF SUB-ANTARCTIC MARION ISLAND, PUBLISHED IN THIS JOURNAL 30 YEARS AGO (SMITH 1977). IT EXPANDS ON THE QUALITATIVE CONSIDERATIONS OF PATTERNS OF ENERGY FLOW AND NUTRIENT CYCLING PRESENTED IN THAT PAPER, BY PROVIDING QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION FROM SUBSEQUENT RESEARCH AT THE ISLAND. PRIMARY PRODUCTION OF THE ISLAND'S LOWLAND PLANT COMMUNITIES IS HIGH ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, BECAUSE THE VEGETATION HAS A LONG GROWING SEASON DUE TO THE LACK OF SEVERELY COLD WINTERS OR DROUGHT. DAILY PRODUCTIVITY IS ACTUALLY LOW DUE TO LOW RADIATION LEVELS AND A COOL GROWING SEASON. THE VEGETATION IS PARTICULARLY EFFICIENT REGARDING ITS USE OF NUTRIENTS FOR ITS GROWTH, BUT STILL REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF NUTRIENTS TO SUPPORT THE HIGH ANNUAL PRODUCTION. SEABIRDS AND SEALS IMPORT LARGE QUANTITIES OF NUTRIENTS FROM THE OCEAN WHEN THEY BREED AND MOULT ON THE ISLAND. THEY MARKEDLY ENHANCE SOIL AND PLANT NUTRIENT STATUS IN THE AREAS IN WHICH THEY OCCUR, AND ALSO IN ADJACENT AREAS. HOWEVER, BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF THE ISLAND'S INLAND VEGETATION IS NOT DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY BIRDS OR SEALS AND MOST OF THE NUTRIENTS REQUIRED FOR PLANT GROWTH ARE PROVIDED BY DECOMPOSITION OF PLANT LITTER AND PEAT. SOIL INVERTEBRATES ARE CRUCIAL FACILITATORS OF DECOMPOSITION PROCESSES, WHICH ARE OTHERWISE RESTRICTED BY LOW SOIL TEMPERATURES AND HIGH SOIL MOISTURE CONTENTS. INTRODUCED HOUSE MICE HAVE INVADED ALMOST ALL PARTS OF THE ISLAND AND PREDATE HEAVILY ON THE INVERTEBRATES, THUS AFFECTING NUTRIENT MINERALISATION. THIS THREATENS NOT ONLY THE FUNCTIONING (LOWERED NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY LEADING TO SLOWER PLANT GROWTH AND THE PRODUCTION OF A LOWER QUALITY, MORE DECOMPOSITION-RECALCITRANT PLANT LITTER), BUT ALSO THE STRUCTURE (AN ALTERED BALANCE BETWEEN PRODUCTION AND DECOMPOSITION LEADS TO A CHANGE IN THE RELATION BETWEEN PEAT FORMATION AND DEGRADATION, WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF VEGETATION SUCCESSION) OF THE ISLAND'S ECOSYSTEM. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT MICE MAY ALSO AFFECT THE ISLAND'S ECOLOGY BY PREDATING ON SEABIRD CHICKS.;ENERGY FLOW AND NUTRIENT CYCLING IN THE MARION ISLAND TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEM: 30 YEARS ON;POLAR RECORD;REVIEW;JUL;2008;10.1017/S0032247407007218;"ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES";WOS:000257222300002
ZHAO JB, 2016, GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL-a;"ZHAO JB;PEICHL M;OQUIST M;NILSSON MB";"IN HIGH-LATITUDE REGIONS, CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EMISSIONS DURING THE WINTER REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE ANNUAL ECOSYSTEM CARBON BUDGET; HOWEVER, THE MECHANISMS THAT CONTROL THE WINTER CO2 EMISSIONS ARE CURRENTLY NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT SUBSTRATE AVAILABILITY FROM SOIL LABILE CARBON POOLS IS A MAIN DRIVER OF WINTER CO2 EMISSIONS. IN ECOSYSTEMS THAT ARE DOMINATED BY ANNUAL HERBACEOUS PLANTS, MUCH OF THE BIOMASS PRODUCED DURING THE SUMMER IS LIKELY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SOIL LABILE CARBON POOL THROUGH LITTER FALL AND ROOT SENESCENCE IN THE AUTUMN. THUS, THE SUMMER CARBON UPTAKE IN THE ECOSYSTEM MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE SUBSEQUENT WINTER CO2 EMISSIONS. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE CONDUCTED A PLOT-SCALE SHADING EXPERIMENT IN A BOREAL PEATLAND TO REDUCE THE GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION (GPP) DURING THE GROWING SEASON. AT THE GROWING SEASON PEAK, VASCULAR PLANT BIOMASS IN THE SHADED PLOTS WAS HALF THAT IN THE CONTROL PLOTS. DURING THE SUBSEQUENT WINTER, THE MEAN CO2 EMISSION RATES WERE 21% LOWER IN THE SHADED PLOTS THAN IN THE CONTROL PLOTS. IN ADDITION, LONG-TERM (2001-2012) EDDY COVARIANCE DATA FROM THE SAME SITE SHOWED A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN THE GPP (PARTICULARLY THE LATE SUMMER AND AUTUMN GPP) AND THE SUBSEQUENT WINTER NET ECOSYSTEM CO2 EXCHANGE (NEE). IN CONTRAST, ABIOTIC FACTORS DURING THE WINTER COULD NOT EXPLAIN THE INTERANNUAL VARIATION IN THE CUMULATIVE WINTER NEE.

THE GEOCHEMICAL RECORDS SHOW CHANGING AQUIFER SALINITY SPANNING THE LAST SIMILAR TO 8.5 CAL KYRS BP AND INTERRELATIONSHIPS WITH HOLOCENE CLIMATE TRENDS (WET AND DRY PERIODS). DURING THE WET MID-HOLOCENE, THE SALINITY OF THE METEORIC WATER MASS (WM; AT 7.8-8.3 CAL KYRS BP) WAS RELATIVELY HIGH AT 1.5-2.7 PPT AND THEN BECAME LESS SALINE (1.0-1.5 PPT) DURING THE LAST SIMILAR TO 7000 YRS AS CLIMATE BECAME PROGRESSIVELY DRIER. HIGH SALINITY OF THE METEORIC WM DURING THE WET MID-HOLOCENE IS ATTRIBUTED TO INCREASED TURBULENT MIXING BETWEEN THE METEORIC AND UNDERLYING MARINE WM. INCREASED PRECIPITATION, IN TERMS OF AMOUNT, FREQUENCY, AND INTENSITY (E.G. HURRICANES) CAUSES HIGHER FLOW OF METEORIC WATER TOWARDS THE COAST AND MIXING AT THE HALOCLINE, A PHENOMENON RECORDED WITH RECENT INSTRUMENTAL MONITORING OF THE AQUIFER. CONVERSELY, DURING DRY PERIODS REDUCED PRECIPITATION AND FLOW IN THE METEORIC WM WOULD RESULT IN LOWER SALINITY.

THE ROBUSTNESS OF WATER-TABLE RESULTS WAS ASSESSED USING COMPARISONS OF FOUR SEPARATE TRANSFER FUNCTIONS, A TESTATE AMOEBA RECONSTRUCTION FROM AN ADDITIONAL SITE IN SOUTHERN WEST SIBERIA, AND AN INDEPENDENT HYDROLOGICAL PROXY OF THE C-13 VALUES OF SPHAGNUM REMAINS FROM THE SAME CORE. THE PALEOHYDROLOGY RESULTS WERE ROBUST IN THAT (1) ALL FOUR TRANSFER FUNCTIONS RETURNED SIMILAR RESULTS, (2) BOTH PEATLAND SITES DISPLAYED VERY SIMILAR WATER-TABLE FLUCTUATIONS DESPITE THEIR DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER, AND (3) SPHAGNUM C-13 VALUES SHOWED SIMILAR OVERALL CHANGES AS THE TESTATE AMOEBA-INFERRED HYDROLOGY, BUT AT A COARSER TEMPORAL RESOLUTION.

BOREAL WETLAND WATER BUDGETS ARE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THE FOLLOWING: SEASONAL WEATHER PATTERNS AS THEY RELATE TO THE TIMING OF PRECIPITATION AND MELTWATER INPUTS AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION (ET) LOSSES; VEGETATION COVER IN THE WETLAND AND SURROUNDING UPLANDS AS IT RELATES TO RAIN AND SNOW INTERCEPTION AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; AND CONNECTIVITY OF THE WETLAND TO THE REGIONAL HYDROLOGICAL NETWORK.

OFTEN THOUGHT OF AS TALL TREES OF HUMID, WARM FORESTS, THEY ARE PRESENT THROUGHOUT IN ALPINE SHRUBLANDS, TREE LINES, BOGS, SWAMPS, AND IN DRY, FROST-PRONE REGIONS. THE TALL CONIFERS RARELY FORM PURELY CONIFEROUS FOREST AND MOSTLY OCCUR AS AN EMERGENT STRATUM ABOVE EVERGREEN ANGIOSPERM TREES. DURING MAORI SETTLEMENT IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY, FIRE-SENSITIVE TREES SUCCUMBED RAPIDLY, MOST OF THE DRIER FORESTS BEING LOST.

HILGEN FJ, 2010, EARTH-SCI REV;HILGEN FJ;TODAY ASTRONOMICAL TUNING IS WIDELY ACCEPTED AS NUMERICAL DATING METHOD AFTER HAVING REVOLUTIONISED THE AGE CALIBRATION OF THE GEOLOGICAL ARCHIVE AND TIME SCALE OVER THE LAST DECADES. HOWEVER, ITS ORIGIN IS NOT WELL KNOWN AND TRACING ITS ROOTS IS IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY FROM A SCIENCE HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE. ASTRONOMICAL TUNING DEVELOPED IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE ASTRONOMICAL THEORY OF THE ICE AGES AND WAS REPEATEDLY USED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE 19TH CENTURY BEFORE THE INVENTION OF RADIO-ISOTOPIC DATING. BUILDING UPON EARLIER IDEAS OF JOSEPH ADHEMAR. JAMES CROLL STARTED TO FORMULATE HIS ASTRONOMICAL THEORY OF THE ICE AGES IN 1864 ACCORDING TO WHICH PRECESSION CONTROLLED ICE AGES OCCUR ALTERNATINGLY ON BOTH HEMISPHERES AT TIMES OF MAXIMUM ECCENTRICITY OF THE EARTH'S ORBIT. THE PUBLICATION OF THESE IDEAS COMPELLED CHARLES LYELL TO REVISE HIS PRINCIPLES OF GEOLOGY AND ADD CROLL'S THEORY, THUS PROVIDING AN ALTERNATIVE TO HIS OWN GEOGRAPHICAL CAUSE OF THE ICE AGES. BOTH CROLL AND LYELL INITIALLY TUNED THE LAST GLACIAL EPOCH TO THE PROMINENT ECCENTRICITY MAXIMUM 850,000YR AGO. THIS AGE WAS USED AS STARTING POINT BY LYELL TO CALCULATE AN AGE OF 240 MILLION YEARS FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE CAMBRIUM. BUT CROLL SOON REVISED THE TUNING TO A MUCH YOUNGER LESS PROMINENT ECCENTRICITY MAXIMUM BETWEEN 240,000 AND 80,000YR AGO. IN ADDITION HE TUNED OLDER GLACIAL DEPOSITS OF LATE MIOCENE AND EOCENE AGES TO ECCENTRICITY MAXIMA AROUND 800,000 AND 2,800,000YR AGO. ARCHIBALD AND JAMES GEIKIE WERE THE FIRST TO RECOGNIZE INTERGLACIALS DURING THE LAST GLACIAL EPOCH, AS PREDICTED BY CROLL'S THEORY, AND ATTEMPTED TO TUNE THEM TO PRECESSION. SOON AFTER FRANK TAYLOR LINKED A SERIES OF 15 END-MORAINES LEFT BEHIND BY THE RETREATING ICE SHEET TO PRECESSION TO ARRIVE AT A POSSIBLE AGE OF 300,000YR FOR THE MAXIMUM GLACIATION. IN A CLASSIC PAPER, AXEL BLYTT (1876) EXPLAINED THE SCATTERED DISTRIBUTION OF PLANT GROUPS IN NORWAY TO PRECESSION INDUCED ALTERNATING RAINY AND DRY PERIODS AS RECORDED BY THE LAYERING IN HOLOCENE PEAT BOGS. HE SPECIFICALLY LINKED THE EXCEPTIONALLY WET ATLANTIC PERIOD TO THE PROLONGED PRECESSION MINIMUM AT 33,300YR AGO AND FURTHER RELATED BASIC STRATIGRAPHIC ALTERNATIONS TO PRECESSION INDUCED CLIMATE CHANGE IN GENERAL. SUCH A LINKAGE WAS ALSO PROPOSED BY GROVE KARL GILBERT FOR CYCLIC ALTERNATIONS IN THE MARINE CRETACEOUS OF NORTH AMERICA. EXTRAPOLATING SEDIMENTATION RATES, HE ARRIVED AT AN ASTRONOMICAL DURATION FOR PART OF THE CRETACEOUS THAT WAS ROUGHLY AS LONG AS THE FINAL ESTIMATE OF WILLIAM THOMSON FOR THE AGE OF THE EARTH. ASSUMING THAT ORBITAL PARAMETERS DIRECTLY AFFECT SEA LEVEL, KARL MAYER-EYMAR AND BLYTT CORRELATED THE WELL KNOWN SUCCESSION OF TERTIARY STAGES TO PRECESSION AND ECCENTRICITY, RESPECTIVELY. REMARKABLY, BLYTT, LIKE CROLL BEFORE HIM, USED VERY LONG-PERIOD CYCLES IN ECCENTRICITY TO ESTABLISH AND VALIDATE HIS TUNING. UNDERSTANDABLY THESE STUDIES IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE 19TH CENTURY WERE LARGELY DEDUCTIVE IN NATURE AND PROVED PARTLY INCORRECT LATER. NEVERTHELESS, THIS FASCINATING PERIOD MARKS A CRUCIAL PHASE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ASTRONOMICAL THEORY OF THE ICE AGES AND CLIMATE, AND IN ASTRONOMICAL DATING. IT PRECEDED THE FINAL INDUCTIVE PHASE, WHICH STARTED WITH THE RECOVERY OF DEEP-SEA CORES IN 1947 AND LED TO A SPECTACULAR REVIVAL OF THE ASTRONOMICAL THEORY, BY A CENTURY.

THEY ARE CHARACTERIZED BY A NEAR-SURFACE WATER TABLE CONTROLLED BY A COMBINATION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PROCESSES, INFLUENCED BY SHORT-TERM METEOROLOGICAL AND LONG-TERM CLIMATE VARIATIONS AMONG OTHER FACTORS. SITE-SPECIFIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS PEAT HYDRODYNAMIC PROPERTIES, SURFACE VEGETATION PATTERNS, AND HYDROGEOLOGICAL SETTING ALSO SUBSTANTIALLY INFLUENCE WATER TABLE DYNAMICS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK WAS TO CHARACTERIZE THE INFLUENCE OF HYDROGEOLOGICAL SETTING AND METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS ON WATER TABLE DEPTHS (WTD) AND ON FLUCTUATIONS THEREIN IN SEVEN OMBROTROPHIC PEATLANDS IN OR NEAR THE ST. LAWRENCE LOWLANDS (SOUTHERN QUEBEC, CANADA). UP-GRADIENT, MID-GRADIENT, AND DOWN-GRADIENT LOCATIONS WERE MONITORED IN THE SEVEN PEATLANDS, USING DIPWELLS WITH HOURLY WTD RECORDINGS. WTD WAS ALSO MONITORED IN THE MARGINAL MINEROTROPHIC ZONE FOUND IN THREE OF THE SEVEN PEATLANDS. ADDITIONALLY, HEADS IN THE OUTFLOW (I.E., RECEIVING DIFFUSED WATER FROM THE PEATLAND) AND INFLOW (I.E., PROVIDING DIFFUSED WATER TO THE PEATLAND) ZONES WITHIN THE ADJACENT MINERAL DEPOSITS WERE MONITORED IN SEVEN AND THREE PEATLANDS RESPECTIVELY, USING PIEZOMETERS WITH HOURLY HYDRAULIC HEAD RECORDINGS. HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITIES FOR THE OUTFLOW ZONES RANGED BETWEEN 1.4*10(-7) AND 8.5*10(-3) CM/S, WHEREAS THOSE OF THE INFLOW ZONES RANGED BETWEEN 5.6*10(-7) AND 3.9*10(-6) CM/S. EVAPOTRANSPIRATION WAS SHOWN TO BE THE DOMINANT FACTOR CONTROLLING MONTHLY CUMULATIVE WATER TABLE DECREASES (MCD), WHILE PRECIPITATION DOMINATED THE MONTHLY CUMULATIVE WATER TABLE INCREASES (MCI). A STRONG CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN MEAN PEATLAND WTD AND OUTFLOW ZONE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY. PEATLANDS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AS BEING STRONGLY CONNECTED WITH THE ADJACENT MINERAL DEPOSITS IN A DIFFUSE UNDERGROUND OUTFLOW ZONE SHOWED THE GREATEST VARIATIONS IN WATER STORAGE. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN PEATLANDS AND ADJACENT MINERAL DEPOSITS IN CONTROLLING WTD, AS FOUND FOR THOSE LOCATED IN THE ST. LAWRENCE LOWLANDS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT WATER TABLE FLUCTUATIONS ARE STRONGLY CONTROLLED BY METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS, AND THAT HYDROGEOLOGICAL SETTING EXERTS A STRONG CONTROL ON MCI AND MCD.

NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS INDICATE THAT AIR TEMPERATURE IN THE PERMAFROST REGIONS OF NORTHEAST CHINA HAS BEEN ON THE RISE SINCE THE 1950S, AND WILL KEEP RISING IN THE 21"" CENTURY, LEADING TO EXTENSIVE DEGRADATION OF PERMAFROST. PERMAFROST DEGRADATION IN NNE CHINA HAS ITS OWN CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS NORTHWARD SHIFTS IN THE SHAPE OF A ""W"" FOR THE PERMAFROST SOUTHERN BOUNDARY (SLP), DISCONTINUOUS PERMAFROST DEGRADATION INTO ISLANDLIKE FROZEN SOIL, AND GRADUALLY DISAPPEARING ISLAND PERMAFROST. PERMAFROST DEGRADATION LEADS TO DETERIORATION OF THE ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT IN COLD REGIONS. AS A RESULT, THE BELT OF LARCH FORESTS DOMINATED BY LARIX GMELINII HAS SHIFTED NORTHWARDS AND WETLAND AREAS WITH SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH PERMAFROST HAVE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. WITH RAPID RETREAT AND THINNING OF PERMAFROST AND VEGETATION CHANGE, THE CO2 AND CH4 FLUX INCREASES WITH MEAN AIR TEMPERATURE FROM CONTINUOUS TO SPORADIC PERMAFROST AREAS AS A RESULT OF ACTIVITY OF METHANOGEN ENHANCEMENT, POSITIVELY FEEDING BACK TO CLIMATE WARMING.

SALIMI S, 2021, J ENVIRON MANAGE-a;"SALIMI S;ALMUKTAR SAAAN;SCHOLZ M";CLIMATE CHANGE IS IDENTIFIED AS A MAJOR THREAT TO WETLANDS. ALTERED HYDROLOGY AND RISING TEMPERATURE CAN CHANGE THE BIOGEOCHEMISTRY AND FUNCTION OF A WETLAND TO THE DEGREE THAT SOME IMPORTANT SERVICES MIGHT BE TURNED INTO DISSERVICES. THIS MEANS THAT THEY WILL, FOR EXAMPLE, NO LONGER PROVIDE A WATER PURIFICATION SERVICE AND ADVERSELY THEY MAY START TO DECOMPOSE AND RELEASE NUTRIENTS TO THE SURFACE WATER. MOREOVER, A HIGHER RATE OF DECOMPOSITION THAN PRIMARY PRODUCTION (PHOTOSYNTHESIS) MAY LEAD TO A SHIFT OF THEIR FUNCTION FROM BEING A SINK OF CARBON TO A SOURCE. THIS REVIEW PAPER ASSESSES THE POTENTIAL RESPONSE OF NATURAL WETLANDS (PEATLANDS) AND CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN TERMS OF GAS EMISSION AND NUTRIENTS RELEASE. IN ADDITION, THE IMPACT OF KEY CLIMATIC FACTORS SUCH AS TEMPERATURE AND WATER AVAILABILITY ON WETLANDS HAS BEEN REVIEWED. THE AUTHORS IDENTIFIED THE METHODOLOGICAL GAPS AND WEAKNESSES IN THE LITERATURE AND THEN INTRODUCED A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR CONDUCTING A COMPREHENSIVE MESOCOSM EXPERIMENT TO ADDRESS THE EXISTING GAPS IN LITERATURE TO SUPPORT FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH ON WETLAND ECOSYSTEMS. IN THE FUTURE, HIGHER TEMPERATURES RESULTING IN DROUGHT MIGHT SHIFT THE ROLE OF BOTH CONSTRUCTED WETLAND AND PEATLAND FROM A SINK TO A SOURCE OF CARBON. HOWEVER, HIGHER TEMPERATURES ACCOMPANIED BY MORE PRECIPITATION CAN PROMOTE PHOTOSYNTHESIS TO A DEGREE THAT MIGHT EXCEED THE RESPIRATION AND MAINTAIN THE CARBON SINK ROLE OF THE WETLAND. THERE MIGHT BE A CRITICAL WATER LEVEL AT WHICH THE WETLAND CAN PRESERVE MOST OF ITS SERVICES. IN ORDER TO FIND THAT LEVEL, A STUDY OF THE KEY FACTORS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THEIR INTERACTIONS USING AN APPROPRIATE EXPERIMENTAL METHOD IS NECESSARY. SOME CONTRADICTORY RESULTS OF PAST EXPERIMENTS CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES, DESIGNS, TIME PERIODS, CLIMATES, AND NATURAL VARIABILITY. HENCE A LONG-TERM SIMULATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE FOR WETLANDS ACCORDING TO THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK IS RECOMMENDED. THIS FRAMEWORK PROVIDES RELATIVELY MORE ACCURATE AND REALISTIC SIMULATIONS, VALID COMPARATIVE RESULTS, COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORTS COORDINATION BETWEEN RESEARCHERS.

HOWEVER, THE RELATIVE ROLE OF THESE FACTORS IN DRIVING VARIATION IN C-3 AND C-4 GRASS ABUNDANCES IN THE PALEORECORD IS UNCERTAIN, AND C-4 ABUNDANCE IS OFTEN INTERPRETED NARROWLY AS A PROXY INDICATOR OF ARIDITY OR PCO(2). WE MEASURED DELTA C-13 VALUES OF INDIVIDUAL GRAINS OF GRASS (POACEAE) POLLEN IN THE SEDIMENTS OF TWO SITES IN SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA TO ASSESS CHANGES IN THE PROPORTIONS OF C-3 AND C-4 GRASSES DURING THE PAST 25,000 YEARS. THESE DATA WERE COMPARED WITH SHIFTS IN PCO(2), TEMPERATURE, MOISTURE BALANCE, AND FIRE TO ASSESS HOW THESE FACTORS WERE RELATED TO LONG-TERM VARIATION OF C-4 GRASS ABUNDANCE DURING THE LATE QUATERNARY. AT CALEDONIA FEN, A HIGH-ELEVATION SITE IN THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS, C-4 GRASS ABUNDANCE DECREASED FROM AN AVERAGE OF 66% DURING THE GLACIAL PERIOD TO 11% DURING THE HOLOCENE, PRIMARILY IN RESPONSE TO INCREASED PCO(2) AND TEMPERATURE. IN CONTRAST, THIS PATTERN DID NOT EXIST IN LOW-ELEVATION SAVANNAH WOODLANDS AROUND TOWER HILL NORTHWEST CRATER, WHERE C-4 GRASS ABUNDANCE INSTEAD VARIED IN RESPONSE TO SHIFTS IN REGIONAL ARIDITY. FIRE DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE STRONGLY INFLUENCED THE PROPORTIONS OF C-3 AND C-4 GRASSES ON THE LANDSCAPE AT MILLENNIAL TIMESCALES AT EITHER SITE. THESE PATTERNS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF A RECENT STUDY IN EAST AFRICA, SUGGESTING THAT ELEVATION-RELATED CLIMATIC DIFFERENCES INFLUENCE HOW THE ABUNDANCE OF C-3 AND C-4 GRASSES RESPONDS TO SHIFTS IN CLIMATE AND PCO(2).

BASED ON LARGE NUMBERS OF PREVIOUS STUDIES, THIS PAPER SUMMARIZED THE CHARACTERISTICS OF MERCURY DEPOSITION AND THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND HUMAN ACTIVITIES ON MERCURY DEPOSITION FROM A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT GLOBAL MERCURY DEPOSITION CHANGED SYNCHRONOUSLY, WITH MORE ACCUMULATION DURING THE GLACIAL PERIOD AND LESS ACCUMULATION DURING THE INTERGLACIAL PERIOD. MERCURY DEPOSITION FLUCTUATED GREATLY DURING THE EARLY HOLOCENE BUT WAS STABLE AND LOW DURING THE MID-HOLOCENE. DURING THE LATE HOLOCENE, MERCURY DEPOSITION REACHED THE HIGHEST VALUE. AN INCREASE IN PRECIPITATION PROMOTES A RISE IN FOREST LITTERFALL HG DEPOSITION. NEVERTHELESS, THERE IS A PAUCITY OF RESEARCH ON THE MECHANISMS OF MERCURY DEPOSITION AFFECTED BY LONG-TERM HUMIDITY CHANGES. MERCURY ACCUMULATION WAS RELATIVELY LOW BEFORE THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION CA. 1840, WHILE AFTER INDUSTRIALIZATION, INTENSIVE INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES PRODUCED LARGE AMOUNTS OF ANTHROPOGENIC MERCURY EMISSIONS AND THE ACCUMULATION INCREASED RAPIDLY. SINCE THE 1970S, THE CENTER OF GLOBAL MERCURY PRODUCTION HAS GRADUALLY SHIFTED FROM EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA TO ASIA.

CLIMATE WARMING IS EXPECTED TO HAVE PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED EFFECTS ON PALUDIFIED BOREAL ECOSYSTEMS AND CAN ALTER CURRENT FOREST SPECIES COMPOSITION AND ADAPTATION BY CHANGING SOIL CONDITIONS SUCH AS MOISTURE, TEMPERATURE REGIMES, AND SOIL RESPIRATION. IN THIS PAPER, WE REVIEW AND SYNTHESIZE RESULTS FROM VARIOUS REPORTED STUDIES (I.E., 88 RESEARCH ARTICLES CITED HEREAFTER) TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATIC WARMING ON SOIL CONDITIONS OF PALUDIFIED FORESTS IN NORTH AMERICA. PREDICTIONS THAT GLOBAL WARMING MAY INCREASE THE DECOMPOSITION RATE MUST BE CONSIDERED IN COMBINATION WITH ITS IMPACT ON SOIL MOISTURE, WHICH APPEARS TO BE A LIMITING FACTOR. LOCAL ADAPTATION OR ACCLIMATION TO CURRENT CLIMATIC CONDITIONS IS OCCURRING IN BOREAL FORESTS, WHICH IS LIKELY TO BE IMPORTANT FOR CONTINUED ECOSYSTEM STABILITY IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE MOST COMMONLY CITED RESPONSE OF BOREAL FOREST SPECIES TO GLOBAL WARMING IS A NORTHWARD MIGRATION THAT TRACKS THE CLIMATE AND SOIL CONDITIONS (E.G., TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE) TO WHICH THEY ARE ADAPTED. YET, SOME CONSTRAINTS MAY INFLUENCE THIS KIND OF ADAPTATION, SUCH AS WATER AVAILABILITY, CHANGES IN FIRE REGIMES, DECOMPOSER ADAPTATIONS, AND THE DYNAMIC OF PEAT ACCUMULATION.

AN INCREASE SCENARIO IN PRECIPITATION WILL LIKELY FAVOR PEAT ACCUMULATION IN BOREAL FOREST STANDS PRONE TO PALUDIFICATION AND FACILITATE FORESTED PEATLAND EXPANSION INTO UPLAND FOREST, WHILE DECREASED OR UNCHANGED PRECIPITATION COMBINED WITH AN INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE WILL PROBABLY FAVOR SUCCESSION OF FORESTED PEATLANDS TO UPLAND BOREAL FORESTS.

TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF WARMING ON GHG DYNAMICS, WE DEPLOYED OPEN-TOP CHAMBERS IN A SUBARCTIC TUNDRA SITE IN NORTHEAST EUROPEAN RUSSIA. WE DETERMINED CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), METHANE (CH4), AND NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) FLUXES AS WELL AS THE CONCENTRATION OF THOSE GASES, INORGANIC NITROGEN (N) AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC) ALONG THE SOIL PROFILE. STUDIED TUNDRA SURFACES RANGED FROM MINERAL TO ORGANIC SOILS AND FROM VEGETATED TO UNVEGETATED AREAS. AS A RESULT OF AIR WARMING, THE SEASONAL GHG BUDGET OF THE VEGETATED TUNDRA SURFACES SHIFTED FROM A GHG SINK OF -300 TO -198 G CO2 -EQ M(-2) TO A SOURCE OF 105 TO 144 G CO2 -EQ M(-2). AT BARE PEAT SURFACES, WE OBSERVED INCREASED RELEASE OF ALL THREE GHGS. WHILE THE POSITIVE WARMING RESPONSE WAS DOMINATED BY CO2, WE PROVIDE HERE THE FIRST IN SITU EVIDENCE OF INCREASING N2O EMISSIONS FROM TUNDRA SOILS WITH WARMING. WARMING PROMOTED N2O RELEASE NOT ONLY FROM BARE PEAT, PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED AS A STRONG N2O SOURCE, BUT ALSO FROM THE ABUNDANT, VEGETATED PEAT SURFACES THAT DO NOT EMIT N2O UNDER PRESENT CLIMATE. AT THESE SURFACES, ELEVATED TEMPERATURES HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON PLANT GROWTH, RESULTING IN LOWER PLANT N UPTAKE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, BETTER N AVAILABILITY FOR SOIL MICROBES. ALTHOUGH THE WARMING WAS LIMITED TO THE SOIL SURFACE AND DID NOT ALTER THAW DEPTH, IT INCREASED CONCENTRATIONS OF DOC, CO2, AND CH4 IN THE SOIL DOWN TO THE PERMAFROST TABLE. THIS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO DOWNWARD DOC LEACHING, FUELING MICROBIAL ACTIVITY AT DEPTH. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR RESULTS EMPHASIZE THE TIGHT LINKAGES BETWEEN PLANT AND SOIL PROCESSES, AND DIFFERENT SOIL LAYERS, WHICH NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN PREDICTING THE CLIMATE CHANGE FEEDBACK OF THE ARCTIC.","WARMING OF SUBARCTIC TUNDRA INCREASES EMISSIONS OF ALL THREE IMPORTANT GREENHOUSE GASES - CARBON DIOXIDE, METHANE, AND NITROUS OXIDE","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","ARTICLE","AUG",2017,"10.1111/gcb.13563","BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000404863300015"

WE ANALYZED A UNIQUE DATA SET (12 PEATLANDS, 48 SITES AND 122 ANNUAL BUDGETS) OF MAINLY UNPUBLISHED GHG EMISSIONS FROM GRASSLANDS ON BOG AND FEN PEAT AS WELL AS OTHER SOILS RICH IN SOIL ORGANIC CARBON (SOC) IN GERMANY. EMISSIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES WERE MEASURED WITH IDENTICAL METHODS. SITE-AVERAGED GHG BUDGETS WERE SURPRISINGLY VARIABLE (29.2 +/- 17.4 T CO2-EQ. HA(-1)YR(-1)) AND PARTIALLY HIGHER THAN ALL PUBLISHED DATA AND THE IPCC DEFAULT EMISSION FACTORS FOR GHG INVENTORIES. GENERALLY, CO2 (27.7 +/- 17.3 T CO(2)HA(-1)YR(-1)) DOMINATED THE GHG BUDGET. NITROUS OXIDE (2.3 +/- 2.4KG N2O-N HA(-1)YR(-1)) AND METHANE EMISSIONS (30.8 +/- 69.8KG CH4-C HA(-1)YR(-1)) WERE LOWER THAN EXPECTED EXCEPT FOR CH4 EMISSIONS FROM NUTRIENT-POOR ACIDIC SITES. AT SINGLE PEATLANDS, CO2 EMISSIONS CLEARLY INCREASED WITH DEEPER MEAN WATER TABLE DEPTH (WTD), BUT THERE WAS NO GENERAL DEPENDENCY OF CO2 ON WTD FOR THE COMPLETE DATA SET. THUS, REGIONALIZATION OF CO2 EMISSIONS BY WTD ONLY WILL REMAIN UNCERTAIN. WTD DYNAMICS EXPLAINED SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PEATLANDS AS SITES WHICH BECAME VERY DRY DURING SUMMER SHOWED LOWER EMISSIONS. WE INTRODUCED THE AERATED NITROGEN STOCK (N-AIR) AS A VARIABLE COMBINING SOIL NITROGEN STOCKS WITH WTD. CO2 INCREASED WITH N-AIR ACROSS PEATLANDS. SOILS WITH COMPARATIVELY LOW SOC CONCENTRATIONS SHOWED AS HIGH CO2 EMISSIONS AS TRUE PEAT SOILS BECAUSE N-AIR WAS SIMILAR. N2O EMISSIONS WERE CONTROLLED BY THE WTD DYNAMICS AND THE NITROGEN CONTENT OF THE TOPSOIL. CH4 EMISSIONS CAN BE WELL DESCRIBED BY WTD AND PONDING DURATION DURING SUMMER.

GIVEN THAT GHG EMISSIONS IN TIDALLY-RESTRICTED, DEGRADED WETLANDS ARE CAUSED BY HUMAN ACTIVITY, THEY ARE ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS, AND REDUCING THEM WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON CLIMATE THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO REDUCED EMISSION OF AN EQUAL QUANTITY OF FOSSIL FUEL GHG.

RAPID WARMING ACROSS NORTHERN BIOMES THREATENS TO ACCELERATE RATES OF PEATLAND ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION. DESPITE COMPENSATORY INCREASES IN NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION, GREATER ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION COULD SIGNAL THE RELEASE OF ANCIENT, CENTURY- TO MILLENNIA-OLD CARBON FROM THE PEATLAND ORGANIC MATTER STOCK. WARMING HAS ALREADY BEEN SHOWN TO PROMOTE ANCIENT PEATLAND CARBON RELEASE, BUT, DESPITE THE KEY ROLE OF VEGETATION IN CARBON DYNAMICS, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW PLANTS INFLUENCE THE SOURCE OF PEATLAND ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION. HERE, WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE USING INSITU(14)C MEASUREMENTS OF ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION ON AN ESTABLISHED PEATLAND WARMING AND VEGETATION MANIPULATION EXPERIMENT. RESULTS SHOW THAT WARMING OF APPROXIMATELY 1 DEGREES C PROMOTES RESPIRATION OF ANCIENT PEATLAND CARBON (UP TO 2100YEARS OLD) WHEN DWARF-SHRUBS OR GRAMINOIDS ARE PRESENT, AN EFFECT NOT OBSERVED WHEN ONLY BRYOPHYTES ARE PRESENT. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT WARMING LIKELY PROMOTES ANCIENT PEATLAND CARBON RELEASE VIA ITS CONTROL OVER ORGANIC INPUTS FROM VASCULAR PLANTS. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT DWARF-SHRUBS AND GRAMINOIDS PRIME MICROBIAL DECOMPOSITION OF PREVIOUSLY LOCKED-UP' ORGANIC MATTER FROM POTENTIALLY DEEP IN THE PEAT PROFILE, FACILITATING LIBERATION OF ANCIENT CARBON AS CO2. FURTHERMORE, SUCH PLANT-INDUCED PEAT RESPIRATION COULD CONTRIBUTE UP TO 40% OF ECOSYSTEM CO2 EMISSIONS. IF CONSISTENT ACROSS OTHER SUBARCTIC AND ARCTIC ECOSYSTEMS, THIS REPRESENTS A CONSIDERABLE FRACTION OF ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION THAT IS CURRENTLY NOT ACKNOWLEDGED BY GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE MODELS. ULTIMATELY, GREATER CONTRIBUTION OF ANCIENT CARBON TO ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION MAY SIGNAL THE LOSS OF A PREVIOUSLY STABLE PEATLAND CARBON POOL, CREATING POTENTIAL FEEDBACKS TO FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE.","VASCULAR PLANTS PROMOTE ANCIENT PEATLAND CARBON LOSS WITH CLIMATE WARMING","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","ARTICLE","MAY",2016,"10.1111/gcb.13213","BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000373130700016"

REWETTING THESE SOILS IS CONSIDERED AN IMPORTANT CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION TOOL TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND CREATE SUITABLE CONDITIONS FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION. LONG-TERM MONITORING IS ESSENTIAL TO CAPTURE INTERANNUAL VARIATIONS IN GHG EMISSIONS AND ASSOCIATED ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES AND TO REDUCE THE UNCERTAINTY LINKED WITH GHG EMISSION FACTOR CALCULATIONS. IN THIS STUDY, WE PRESENT GHG BALANCES: CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), METHANE (CH4) AND NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) CALCULATED FOR A 5-YEAR PERIOD AT A REWETTED INDUSTRIAL CUTAWAY PEATLAND IN IRELAND (REWETTED 7YEARS PRIOR TO THE START OF THE STUDY); AND COMPARE THE RESULTS WITH AN ADJACENT DRAINED AREA (2-YEAR DATA SET), AND WITH TEN LONG-TERM DATA SETS FROM INTACT (I.E. UNDRAINED) PEATLANDS IN TEMPERATE AND BOREAL REGIONS. IN THE REWETTED SITE, CO2 EXCHANGE (OR NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE (NEE)) WAS STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION (R-ECO) RATHER THAN GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION (GPP). CH4 EMISSIONS WERE RELATED TO SOIL TEMPERATURE AND EITHER WATER TABLE LEVEL OR PLANT BIOMASS. N2O EMISSIONS WERE NOT DETECTED IN EITHER DRAINED OR REWETTED SITES. REWETTING REDUCED CO2 EMISSIONS IN UNVEGETATED AREAS BY APPROXIMATELY 50%. WHEN UPSCALED TO THE ECOSYSTEM LEVEL, THE EMISSION FACTORS (CALCULATED AS 5-YEAR MEAN OF ANNUAL BALANCES) FOR THE REWETTED SITE WERE (+/- SD) -104 +/- 80G CO2-C M(-2)YR(-1) (I.E.

LESS WARMING) IN COMPARISON WITH THE DRAINED SITE BUT WAS STILL HIGHER THAN COMPARATIVE INTACT SITES. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT REWETTED SITES MAY BE MORE SENSITIVE TO INTERANNUAL CHANGES IN WEATHER CONDITIONS THAN THEIR MORE RESILIENT INTACT COUNTERPARTS AND MAY SWITCH FROM AN ANNUAL CO2 SINK TO A SOURCE IF TRIGGERED BY SLIGHTLY DRIER CONDITIONS.","MULTIYEAR GREENHOUSE GAS BALANCES AT A REWETTED TEMPERATE PEATLAND","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","ARTICLE","DEC",2016,"10.1111/gcb.13325","BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000387813300021"

THE RESEARCH PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER AIMED TO QUANTIFY THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, IN TERMS OF GHG (GREEN HOUSE GASES) EMISSIONS OF DIFFERENT NURSERY TYPOLOGIES (IN-POT AND IN-FIELD GROWN PLANTS) AND PRODUCTIONS (SMALL, MEDIUM AND LARGE SIZE PLANTS). FOR THIS REASON, A LCA (LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT) APPROACH WAS CARRIED OUT IN SEVEN DIFFERENT NURSERIES ON ELEVEN PRODUCTION LINES. GWP (GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL) WAS THE IMPACT CATEGORY CHOSEN FOR THIS ANALYSIS, AND THE SQUARE METER WAS USED AS FUNCTIONAL UNIT TO REPRESENT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NURSERY AND PLANT TYPOLOGIES, ALTHOUGH DATA FOR ""PRODUCT"" UNIT ARE SHOWN AS WELL. RESULTS SHOW THAT IN-POT SYSTEMS, WITH AN EMISSIONS RANGE OF 7.444-26.489 KG OF CO2-E ARE MUCH MORE IMPACTING THAN IN-FIELD GROWN PRODUCTION PROCESSES (0.607-1.013 KG OF CO2-E). SUCH GREAT DIFFERENCES ARE MAINLY DUE TO THE PEAT USED IN SUBSTRATE MIXES AND THE PLASTIC USED FOR POTS, INDEED THESE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT SOURCES OF GHG EMISSIONS, AND ARE WIDELY USED IN IN-POT PRODUCTION, WHILE THEY ARE NOT PRESENT IN INFIELD PROCESSES.

MANY COASTAL PEATLANDS ARE DRAINED TO CREATE ARABLE LAND. THIS IS NOT WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES; PHYSICAL COMPACTION OF PEAT AND ITS DEGRADATION BY OXIDATION LEAD TO SUBSIDENCE, AND OXIDATION ALSO LEADS TO EMISSIONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2). THIS STUDY COMPLEMENTS EXISTING STUDIES BY QUANTIFYING TOTAL LAND SUBSIDENCE AND ASSOCIATED CO2 RESPIRATION OVER THE PAST MILLENNIUM IN THE DUTCH COASTAL PEATLANDS, TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO THE CONSEQUENCES OF CULTIVATING COASTAL PEATLANDS OVER LONGER TIMESCALES. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PEAT VOLUME LOSS WAS 19.8 KM(3), WHICH LOWERED THE DUTCH COASTAL PLAIN BY 1.9 M ON AVERAGE, BRINGING MOST OF IT BELOW SEA LEVEL. AT LEAST 66 % OF THE VOLUME REDUCTION IS THE RESULT OF DRAINAGE, AND 34 % WAS CAUSED BY THE EXCAVATION AND SUBSEQUENT COMBUSTION OF PEAT. THE ASSOCIATED CO2 RESPIRATION IS EQUIVALENT TO A GLOBAL ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATION INCREASE OF SIMILAR TO 0.39 PPMV. CULTIVATION OF COASTAL PEATLANDS CAN TURN A CARBON SINK INTO A CARBON SOURCE. IF THE PATH TAKEN BY THE DUTCH WOULD BE FOLLOWED WORLDWIDE, THERE WILL BE DOUBLE TROUBLE: GLOBALLY SIGNIFICANT CARBON EMISSIONS AND INCREASED FLOOD RISK IN A GLOBALLY IMPORTANT HUMAN HABITAT.

TO EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF PERMAFROST THAW AND RESULTANT PLANT SUCCESSION ON DOM REACTIVITY, WE USED A COMBINATION OF FOURIER TRANSFORM ION CYCLOTRON RESONANCE MASS SPECTROMETRY (FT-ICR MS), UV/VIS ABSORBANCE, AND EXCITATION-EMISSION MATRIX SPECTROSCOPY (EEMS) TO EXAMINE THE DOM ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION AND OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF 27 PORE WATER SAMPLES GATHERED FROM VARIOUS SITES ALONG A PERMAFROST THAW SEQUENCE IN STORDALEN MIRE, A THAWING SUBARCTIC PEATLAND IN NORTHERN SWEDEN. THE PRESENCE OF DENSE SPHAGNUM MOSS, A FEATURE THAT IS DOMINANT IN THE INTERMEDIATE THAW STAGES, APPEARED TO BE THE MAIN DRIVER OF VARIATION IN DOM ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION AND OPTICAL PROPERTIES AT STORDALEN. SPECIFICALLY, DOM FROM SITES WITH SPHAGNUM HAD GREATER AROMATICITY, HIGHER AVERAGE MOLECULAR WEIGHTS, AND GREATER O/C, CONSISTENT WITH A HIGHER ABUNDANCE OF PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS THAT LIKELY INHIBIT DECOMPOSITION.

EMISSIONS FROM THERMOKARST LAKES WERE AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LOWER, WHILE THE REST OF THE LANDSCAPE (MINERAL TUNDRA) WAS A WEAK SINK FOR ATMOSPHERIC METHANE. VASCULAR PLANT COVER WAS A KEY FACTOR IN EXPLAINING THE SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF CH4 EMISSIONS AMONG WETLAND TYPES, AS INDICATED BY THE POSITIVE CORRELATION OF EMISSIONS WITH THE LEAF AREA INDEX (LAI). AS ELUCIDATED THROUGH A STABLE ISOTOPE ANALYSIS, THE DOMINANT CH4 RELEASE PATHWAY FROM WETLANDS TO THE ATMOSPHERE WAS PLANT-MEDIATED DIFFUSION THROUGH AERENCHYMA, A PROCESS THAT DISCRIMINATES AGAINST C-13-CH4.

FOUR CASES ARE USED TO ILLUSTRATE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO REACH MITIGATION TARGETS: DETERMINING THE AMOUNT AND PROPERTIES OF PEAT SOILS, ESTIMATING THE POTENTIAL, COSTS AND FEASIBILITY OF THE MITIGATION MEASURES, AND SELECTING AND IMPLEMENTING THE BEST MEASURES. A COMMON FEATURE FOR ALL OF THE CASES WAS THAT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE POLICIES HAVE INCREASED THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN GHG EMISSIONS FROM PEAT SOILS AND INCREASED THE PRESSURE FOR MITIGATION. BASICALLY THE SAME FACTORS RESTRICT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MITIGATION MEASURES IN ALL COUNTRIES WITH SIGNIFICANT PEAT SOIL AREAS. THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE IS LACK OF POLICY COHERENCE, E.G.

THE AIM OF THIS LONG-TERM INCUBATION EXPERIMENT WAS TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF HYDROLOGICAL AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL SOIL PROPERTIES ON EMISSIONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) AND METHANE (CH4). STRONGLY DEGRADED PEAT WITH SAND ADDITION (PEAT-SAND MIXTURES) AND WITHOUT SAND ADDITION (EARTHIFIED PEAT) WAS SYSTEMATICALLY COMPARED UNDER DIFFERENT MOISTURE CONDITIONS FOR FEN AND BOG PEAT. SOIL COLUMNS ORIGINATING FROM BOTH THE TOPSOIL AND THE SUBSOIL OF TEN DIFFERENT PEATLANDS UNDER GRASSLAND USE WERE INVESTIGATED. OVER A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS THE ALMOST SATURATED SOIL COLUMNS WERE DRAINED STEPWISE VIA SUCTION TO -300 HPA. THE CO2 FLUXES WERE LOWEST AT WATER-SATURATED AND DRY SOIL MOISTURE CONDITIONS, RESULTING IN A PARABOLIC DEPENDENCE OF CO2 FLUXES ON THE WATER-FILLED PORE SPACE (WFPS) PEAKING AT 56-92% WFPS.

THIS IMPLIES THAT IF IN THE FUTURE, A SMALLER RATE IN THE OVERALL DECREASING TREND OF N-15(BULK) N2O TROPOSPHERIC ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION IS FOUND, IT CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED ONLY TO AGRICULTURAL N2O EMISSION REDUCTIONS FROM MITIGATION ACTIONS BUT ALSO TO SOILS IN NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS THAT MAY BE EMITTING MORE N2O TO THE ATMOSPHERE DUE TO WARMER CONDITIONS.

HERE, WE DESCRIBE THE METHODOLOGY, DATA AND RESULTS OF THE GERMAN APPROACH FOR MEASUREMENT, REPORTING AND VERIFICATION (MRV) OF ANTHROPOGENIC GHG EMISSIONS FROM DRAINED ORGANIC SOILS AND OUTLINE WAYS FORWARD TOWARDS TRACKING DRAINAGE AND REWETTING. THE METHODOLOGY WAS DEVELOPED FOR AND IS CURRENTLY APPLIED IN THE GERMAN GHG INVENTORY UNDER THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE (UNFCCC) AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL. SPATIAL ACTIVITY DATA COMPRISE HIGH RESOLUTION MAPS OF LAND-USE, TYPE OF ORGANIC SOIL AND MEAN ANNUAL WATER TABLE (WT). THE WT MAP WAS DERIVED BY A BOOSTED REGRESSION TREES MODEL FROM DATA OF MORE THAN 1000 DIPWELLS. EMISSIONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) AND METHANE (CH4) WERE SYNTHESIZED FROM A UNIQUE NATIONAL DATA SET COMPRISING MORE THAN 250 ANNUAL GHG BALANCES FROM 118 SITES IN MOST LAND-USE CATEGORIES AND TYPES OF ORGANIC SOILS. MEASUREMENTS WERE PERFORMED WITH HARMONIZED PROTOCOLS USING MANUAL CHAMBERS. NONLINEAR RESPONSE FUNCTIONS DESCRIBE THE DEPENDENCY OF CO2 AND CH4 FLUXES ON MEAN ANNUAL WT, STRATIFIED BY LAND-USE WHERE APPROPRIATE. MODELLING RESULTS WERE AGGREGATED INTO ""IMPLIED EMISSION FACTORS"" FOR EACH LAND-USE CATEGORY, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE RESPONSE FUNCTIONS, THE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF THE WT WITHIN EACH LAND-USE CATEGORY AND FURTHER GHG SOURCES SUCH AS DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON OR CH4 EMISSIONS FROM DITCHES. IPCC DEFAULT EMISSION FACTORS WERE USED FOR THESE MINOR GHG SOURCES. IN FUTURE, RESPONSE FUNCTIONS COULD BE APPLIED DIRECTLY WHEN APPROPRIATE WT DATA IS AVAILABLE. AS NO FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP WAS FOUND FOR N2O EMISSIONS, EMISSION FACTORS WERE CALCULATED AS THE MEAN OBSERVED FLUX PER LAND-USE CATEGORY. IN GERMANY, DRAINED ORGANIC SOILS EMIT MORE THAN 55 MILLION TONS OF GHGS PER YEAR, OF WHICH 91% ARE CO2. THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO AROUND 6.6% OF THE NATIONAL GHG EMISSIONS IN 2014.

WE GROUPED THE VEGETATION AS GRAMINOIDS, SHRUBS AND SPHAGNUM AND RECALIBRATED THE VEGETATION PARAMETERS ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT CH4 PRODUCTION, OXIDATION AND TRANSPORT CAPACITIES. THEN, WE USED EDDY-COVARIANCE-BASED CH4 FLUX OBSERVATIONS FROM A BOREAL (SIIKANEVA) AND A SUBARCTIC FEN (LOMPOLOJAKA) IN FINLAND TO VALIDATE THE MODEL. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE RECALIBRATED MODEL COULD GENERALLY SIMULATE THE SEASONAL PATTERNS OF THE FINNISH WETLANDS WITH DIFFERENT PLANT COMMUNITIES.

REPORTS OF MULTIPLE YEARS OF DATA FROM A SINGLE SITE WERE AVERAGED AND DIFFERENT MICROFORMS (E.G., HUMMOCK OR HOLLOW) WITHIN THESE PEATLAND TYPES WERE KEPT SEPARATE. A NEW PEATLANDS MAP WAS CREATED FROM FOREST COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE INFORMATION THAT DISTINGUISHES BOG FROM RICH AND POOR FEN. NATIONAL FOREST INVENTORY K-NN FOREST STRUCTURE MAPS, BIOCLIMATIC VARIABLES (MEAN DIURNAL RANGE AND SEASONALITY OF TEMPERATURES) AND GROUND SURFACE SLOPE WERE USED TO CONSTRUCT THE NEW MAP. THE EARTH OBSERVATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT MAP OF WETLANDS WAS USED TO IDENTIFY OPEN PEATLANDS WITH MINOR TREE COVER. RESULTS: THE NEW MAP WAS COMBINED WITH AVERAGES OF OBSERVED NEE AND CH4 EMISSIONS TO ESTIMATE A GROWING SEASON INTEGRATED NEE (+/- SE) AT - 108.8 (+/- 41.3) MT CO2 SEASON(-1) AND CH4 EMISSION AT 4.1 (+/- 1.5) MT CH4 SEASON(-1) FOR THE SEVEN ECOZONES.

BOREAL PLAINS PEATLANDS CONTRIBUTED MOST TO THE NEE SINK DUE TO HIGH CO2 UPTAKE RATES AND LARGE PEATLAND AREAS, WHILE BOREAL SHIELD PEATLANDS CONTRIBUTED MOST TO CH4 EMISSIONS DUE TO MODERATE EMISSION RATES AND LARGE PEATLAND AREAS.

WE COLLECTED DOC WITH A MODERN C-14 SIGNATURE FROM A TEMPERATE SCOTTISH PEATLAND STREAM AND DECOMPOSED IT TO PRODUCE CO2 UNDER SIMULATED NATURAL CONDITIONS OVER 140DAYS. WE MEASURED THE C-14 OF BOTH DOC AND CO2 AT SEVEN TIME POINTS AND FOUND THAT WHILE DOC REMAINED CLOSE TO MODERN IN AGE, THE RESULTANT CO2 PROGRESSIVELY INCREASED IN AGE UP TO 2,356767YEARS BP. THE RESULTS OF THIS EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATE THAT THE BULK (DOC)-C-14 POOL CAN HIDE THE PRESENCE OF OLD C WITHIN PEATLAND STREAM DOC EXPORT, DEMONSTRATING THAT BULK (DOC)-C-14 MEASUREMENTS CAN BE AN INSENSITIVE INDICATOR OF PEATLAND DISTURBANCE. OUR EXPERIMENT ALSO DEMONSTRATES THAT THIS OLD C COMPONENT IS BIOLOGICALLY AND PHOTOCHEMICALLY AVAILABLE FOR CONVERSION TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS CO2, AND AS SUCH, BULK (DOC)-C-14 MEASUREMENTS DO NOT REFLECT THE C-14 SIGNATURE OF THE LABILE ORGANIC C POOL EXPORTED BY INLAND WATER SYSTEMS MORE BROADLY.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY THE INTRODUCTION OF OLD CARBON PREVIOUSLY STORED IN SOILS FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS INTO RIVERS CAN INCREASE THE NET FLUX OF GREENHOUSE GASES TO THE ATMOSPHERE, IMPACTING GLOBAL CLIMATE. THIS IS BECAUSE RIVERS TRANSPORT THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE THIRD OF HUMAN CARBON EMISSIONS ANNUALLY FROM LAND TO THE OCEANS. MUCH RIVER-BORNE CARBON IS PLANT AND SOIL (ORGANIC) MATTER THAT CAN DECOMPOSE DURING TRANSPORT, RELEASING GREENHOUSE GASES TO THE ATMOSPHERE. RADIOCARBON DATING CAN REVEAL THE AGE OF RIVER-BORNE CARBON, BUT PREVIOUS MEASUREMENTS MAY HAVE UNDERESTIMATED THE AGE OF CARBON RELEASED INTO RIVERS BY NOT CONSIDERING THE POTENTIAL FOR OLD CARBON HIDDEN WITHIN INDIVIDUAL BULK WATER SAMPLES. USING AN INCUBATION EXPERIMENT, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON FROM A SCOTTISH PEATLAND STREAM THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED MODERN IN AGE USING TRADITIONAL BULK RADIOCARBON DATING CAN READILY DECOMPOSE TO PRODUCE CARBON DIOXIDE WITH AN OLD RADIOCARBON SIGNATURE UP TO SIMILAR TO 2,500YEARS OLD.

FOR THE PURPOSE, AUTHENTIC SOIL ORGANIC MATTER (HUMUS AND PEAT) WAS INCUBATED IN MESH BAGS UNDER PILES AND AT CONTROL PLOTS. THE EFFECT OF PILES WAS ASSUMED TO RESULT FROM PHYSICAL (SHADING AND INSULATION ON SOIL SURFACE) AND CHEMICAL-BIOLOGICAL (LEACHING OF NUTRIENTS AND FRESH ORGANIC MATTER) SOURCES. TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO, ARTIFICIAL PILES OF INORGANIC MATTER WERE ESTABLISHED TO MIMIC THE BARE PHYSICAL EFFECTS. ENHANCEMENT OF DECOMPOSITION IN THE SOIL UNDER THE REAL AND ARTIFICIAL PILES WAS ASSESSED BY MEASURING THE MASS LOSS OF CELLULOSE STRIPS. LOGGING RESIDUE PILES HAD CLEAR PHYSICAL EFFECTS ON SOIL: TEMPERATURES WERE LOWERED AND THEIR DIURNAL VARIATION SUBDUED, AND RELATIVE HUMIDITY AT THE SOIL SURFACE WAS HIGHER. THE EFFECT ON SOIL MOISTURE WAS ALSO EVIDENT, BUT MORE VARIABLE, INCLUDING BOTH DECREASES AND INCREASES. THESE EFFECTS, MIMICKED BY THE ARTIFICIAL PILES, DECREASED RATHER THAN INCREASED CELLULOSE MASS LOSS. AS THE REAL PILES, ON THE OTHER HAND, INCREASED MASS LOSS, WE CONCLUDE THAT LOGGING RESIDUE PILES MAY ENHANCE DECOMPOSITION IN SOIL DUE TO CHEMICAL-BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS.

IT WAS FOUND THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARBON FLUXES FROM THE DIFFERENT SITES, WHICH WE ATTRIBUTED TO CHANGES BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE VEGETATION ON THE PH, PHENOLIC CONCENTRATIONS AND EXTRACELLULAR ENZYME ACTIVITIES FOUND IN THE PEAT MATRIX. PEAT TAKEN FROM SPHAGNUM-DOMINATED AREAS EMITTED LESS CO2 THAN THE OTHER TWO SAMPLE GROUPS, AND HAD LOWER OVERALL DOC CONCENTRATIONS AND PHENOL OXIDASE ACTIVITIES. CONVERSELY, JUNCUS-PEAT HAD THE HIGHEST CO2 AND CH4 FLUXES, ALONG WITH THE GREATEST PHENOL OXIDASE ACTIVITIES. TAKING ALL THE RESULTS INTO CONSIDERATION THE PLANTS WERE RANKED IN ORDER OF THEIR ABILITY TO REDUCE THE LOSS OF CARBON FROM THE PEAT SOIL WITHIN WHICH THEY WERE GROWING: SPHAGNUM>CALLUNA>JUNCUS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT PLANT COMMUNITY STRUCTURES COULD BE ALTERED IN ORDER TO MAXIMISE A PEATLAND'S ABILITY TO BE USED AS A CARBON STORE SHOULD THEY NEED TO BE MANAGED AS PART OF A CARBON STEWARDSHIP SCHEME OR A GEOENGINEERING PROJECT - IF THIS WAS TO BE THE SOLE MANAGEMENT INTEREST IN AN AREA OF PEATLAND.","PLANT SPECIES EFFECTS ON THE CARBON STORAGE CAPABILITIES OF A BLANKET BOG COMPLEX","WETLANDS","ARTICLE","FEB",2016,"10.1007/s13157-015-0714-7","ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000373644000005"

CROP INTENSITIES VARIED FROM GRASSLANDS TO INTENSIVE POTATO CULTIVATION. THE RESULTS SHOWED NO DIFFERENCE IN MEDIAN SEASONAL N2O EMISSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO CROPS COMPARED. MEDIAN SEASONAL EMISSIONS RANGED FROM 0 TO 919 MU G N(2)OM(-2) H(-1), WITH PEAKS ON INDIVIDUAL SAMPLING OCCASIONS OF UP TO 3317 MU G N(2)OM(-2) H(-1). NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS DIFFERED WIDELY BETWEEN SITES, INDICATING THAT SOIL PROPERTIES ARE A REGULATING FACTOR. HOWEVER, PH WAS THE ONLY SOIL FACTOR THAT CORRELATED WITH N2O EMISSIONS (NEGATIVE EXPONENTIAL CORRELATION). THE TYPE OF CROP GROWN ON THE SOIL DID NOT INFLUENCE CH4 FLUXES. MEDIAN SEASONAL CH4 FLUX FROM THE DIFFERENT SITES RANGED FROM UPTAKE OF 36 MU G CH4 M(-2) H(-1) TO RELEASE OF 4.5 MU G CH4 M(-2) H(-1).

RECENTLY USED EMISSION FACTORS ARE MAINLY BASED ON CO2 FLUX MEASUREMENTS BY CHAMBER TECHNIQUES OR THE MICROMETEOROLOGICAL EDDY COVARIANCE (EC) METHOD. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE ABOUT THE RELIABILITY AND COMPARABILITY OF ANNUAL CO2 BALANCES BASED ON THESE METHODS IS SCARCE. THEREFORE, MANUAL CHAMBER MEASUREMENTS OF ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION (R-ECO) AND NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE (NEE) WERE CONDUCTED FOR TWO YEARS (MARCH 2012-APRIL 2014) TO MODEL ANNUAL BALANCES OF TWO SITES ON FEN SOILS WITH DIFFERENT LAND USE INTENSITY IN NORTHERN GERMANY: AN UNUTILIZED AND REWETTED GRASSLAND (UG) AND AN INTENSIVELY UTILIZED WET GRASSLAND (GW). SIMULTANEOUSLY, EC MEASUREMENTS OF NEE WERE CONDUCTED ON THE SITES. TWO REASONS FOR OCCASIONALLY GREAT DEVIATIONS IN NEE BETWEEN THE METHODS COULD BE OBSERVED: (1) THE ACCORDANCE OF BOTH METHODS WAS MOST HAMPERED DURING TRANSITION PERIODS SUCH AS THE BEGINNING OF THE GROWING SEASON AND THE ONSET OF REGROWTH AFTER A GRASSLAND DEFOLIATION DUE TO DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES OF EC AND CHAMBER MEASUREMENTS AND (2) R-ECO AND GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION (GPP) PARTITIONED FROM EC NEE MEASUREMENTS WERE SYSTEMATICALLY LOWER THAN THOSE FROM THE CHAMBER-BASED MODEL, WHICH COULD BE A RESULT OF THE EC ENERGY BALANCE GAP. DIFFERENCES WERE MORE PRONOUNCED FOR THE MANAGED SITE GW AS A RESULT OF MORE FREQUENT REGROWTH PERIODS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE EC AND CHAMBER METHOD CAN SHOW COMPARABLE RESULTS FOR THE CO2 EXCHANGE OF GRASSLANDS ON FEN SOILS WHEN THE LIMITATIONS OF BOTH METHODS ARE KNOWN AND CONSIDERED FOR THE REPORTING OF EMISSION FACTORS. THESE LIMITATIONS ARE DUE TO ENERGY BALANCE CLOSURE AND POTENTIALLY BIASED FOOTPRINTS FOR EC AND A RESTRICTED REPRESENTATIVENESS ESPECIALLY DURING EARLY STAGES OF PLANT DEVELOPMENT FOR THE CHAMBER METHOD.","COMPARING CHAMBER AND EDDY COVARIANCE BASED NET ECOSYSTEM CO2 EXCHANGE OF FEN SOILS","JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE","ARTICLE","APR",2017,"10.1002/jpln.201600447","AGRONOMY; PLANT SCIENCES; SOIL SCIENCE","WOS:000398726100013"

THE REWETTING AND CONVERSION OF MEDIUM-DRAINED GRASSLAND INTO WET GRASSLAND LEAD TO CONSIDERABLE REDUCTIONS OF GHG EMISSIONS. HOWEVER, IN INTENSIVELY MANAGED DAIRY FARMS, THE FULL EMISSION MITIGATION POTENTIAL OF THESE PEATLAND MANAGEMENT OPTIONS IS NOT REALIZED, BECAUSE NECESSARY ADAPTATIONS INCREASE EMISSIONS FROM OTHER SOURCES. BECAUSE OF ITS LOW GHG MITIGATION POTENTIAL, THE CONVERSION OF ARABLE LAND INTO MEDIUM DRAINED INTENSIVE GRASSLAND LEADS TO HIGH ABATEMENT COSTS OF UP TO 92(SIC)/TCO(2)E, WHILE THE ABATEMENT COSTS OF THE REWETTING AND CONVERSION INTO WET GRASSLAND RANGE FROM 5 TO 57(SIC)/TCO(2)E. THE RESULTS VARY BY FARM TYPE, INTENSITY OF AGRICULTURAL PEATLAND USE TO DATE AND THE SHARE OF PEATLAND AREA ON A FARM.

A CASE STUDY USED EMPIRICAL DATA TO INVESTIGATE REALISATION OF SUCH TARGETS IN SCOTLAND REFERENCED AGAINST AMBITIOUS POLICY COMMITMENTS (NET-ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2045). ANALYSIS OF ACTUAL LOCATIONS FOR RECENT AFFORESTATION AND PEATLAND RESTORATION, REFERENCED AGAINST BIOPHYSICAL DATA, SHOWED THAT NEW WOODLAND PRIMARILY OCCURRED ON LAND THAT WAS MARGINAL FOR AGRICULTURE, USUALLY ON WETTER UNCULTIVATED SEMI-NATURAL LAND, OFTEN ON ORGANIC SOILS.

SOIL CH4 EMISSION, DOC, AND THE AROMATICITY AND COMPLEXITY OF DOC INDEXES WERE MONITORED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT FTC SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED CH4 EMISSION POTENTIAL IN THE 0-20 CM SURFACE SOIL LAYER. THE MAXIMUM HOURLY CH4 EMISSION RATE WAS 55.0 MG C M(-2) H(-1), APPROXIMATELY 19 TIMES AS HIGH AS THAT OF THE UNFROZEN CONTROL SAMPLE (2.8 MG C M(-2) H(-1)). HOWEVER, THE PEAK INTENSITY OF CH4 EMISSION DECREASED WHEN THE NUMBERS OF FTC INCREASED. MEANWHILE, FTC NOT ONLY INCREASED THE QUANTITY OF DOC RELEASED, BUT ALSO ENHANCED ITS INSTABILITY VIA INCREASING THE CONTRIBUTION OF RELATIVELY SMALL, READILY DEGRADABLE ORGANIC MOLECULES. ADDITIONALLY, THE CH4 EMISSION POTENTIAL WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH THE AROMATICITY AND COMPLEXITY OF DOC, INDICATING THAT THE RELEASE OF LABILE SUBSTRATES UNDER FTC WAS ONE IMPORTANT FACTOR CONTROLLING THE MICROBIAL PRODUCTION OF CH4 AND THE HIGH EMISSIONS UPON THAWING. OUR STUDY SUGGESTED THAT GLOBAL WARMING-INDUCED INCREASES IN SEASONAL FTC IN BOREAL WETLANDS MAY INCREASE CH4 EMISSIONS BEYOND WHAT WOULD OCCUR FROM LONG-TERM TEMPERATURE INCREASES ALONE.","METHANE EMISSION POTENTIAL FROM FRESHWATER MARSH SOILS OF NORTHEAST CHINA: RESPONSE TO SIMULATED FREEZING-THAWING CYCLES","WETLANDS","ARTICLE","JUN",2017,"10.1007/s13157-017-0879-3","ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000403573000004"

MICROSITE TYPES REFLECTING THE DOMINANT PLANT SPECIES AT THE CHAMBER PLOTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND CLASSIFIED AS ERIOPHORUM-SPHAGNUM, CLADONIA-CALLUNA AND MOLINIA AT POLLAGOONA AND ERIOPHORUM-SPHAGNUM, CLADONIA-MOSSES, ERIOPHORUM AND BRASH (LOGGING RESIDUES) AT SCOHABOY. THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN GAS FLUXES AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES WERE ASSESSED, AND REGRESSION MODELS WERE USED TO ESTIMATE ANNUAL CO2 AND CH4 GAS BALANCES FOR EACH MICROSITE TYPE. ANNUAL ESTIMATES OF N2O EXCHANGE WERE CALCULATED USING SEASONAL MEANS. OVER THE COURSE OF THE STUDY BOTH SITES ACTED AS CO2 AND CH4 SOURCES.

THE CARBON FOOTPRINT IS CONSIDERED DIFFERENT WHEN 95% OF ALL MONTE CARLO ITERATIONS ASSUME THAT ONE FARM HAS HIGHER PRODUCT-RELATED GHG EMISSIONS THAN THE FARM IN COMPARISON. THE UNCERTAINTY OF RESULTS IN THE SINGLE FARMS, EXPRESSED AS TWO-TIMES THE STANDARD DEVIATION DIVIDED BY THE MEDIAN RESULT, RANGES BETWEEN 4.2% AND 15.3%. THIS MEANS THAT 95% OF VALUES IN THE RESULTING DISTRIBUTION OF ONE FARM ARE WITHIN A RANGE OF 4-16% OF THE MEDIAN OF THAT FARM. FARMS CAN BE DIFFERENTIATED WHEN THE VARIATION OF THE CARBON FOOTPRINT IS HIGHER THAN THE UNCERTAINTY OF FARM-RELATED EMISSIONS. FROM ALL 190 DIRECT COMPARISONS OF TWO FARMS IN THE STUDY, 78% ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. FOR THIS UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT, IT MUST BE ESTABLISHED THAT BACKGROUND PROCESSES, ESPECIALLY THE DATASETS FOR IMPORT FEED, CAN BE JUDGED COVARIANT IN ORDER TO PROHIBIT THEM FROM INFLUENCING THE COMPARISON BETWEEN FARMS.

METHANE EMISSIONS AS A RESULT OF METHANOGENESIS AND METHANOTROPHY IN SOIL ARE AFFECTED BY SEVERAL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS SUCH AS TEMPERATURE, OXYGEN AND GROUNDWATER LEVEL. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYSE METHANE CYCLING AS A FUNCTION OF SOIL DEPTH. MATERIALS AND METHODS IN THIS STUDY, METHANE CYCLING AND SOIL ORGANIC MATTER MINERALIZATION WERE INVESTIGATED IN A DRAINED FEN GRASSLAND AREA OF LJUBLJANA MARSH, SLOVENIA THAT HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO RECLAMATION STRATEGIES FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES. POTENTIAL MINERALIZATION, METHANE PRODUCTION AND METHANE OXIDATION RATES WERE MEASURED IN SLURRY INCUBATION EXPERIMENTS WITH SOIL SAMPLES FROM 10 SAMPLING DEPTHS OF A 1-M PROFILE. IN ADDITION, THE EXTENT OF IRON REDUCTION IN THE SOIL WAS DETERMINED. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION THE POTENTIAL FOR METHANE PRODUCTION WAS LOW IN THE INVESTIGATED SOIL PROFILE, EVEN IN CONSTANTLY FLOODED LAYERS BELOW THE WATER TABLE FLUCTUATIONS. DURING ANAEROBIC INCUBATIONS, THE HIGHEST ACCUMULATED CONCENTRATIONS AND PRODUCTION RATES OF METHANE WERE OBSERVED IN THE UPPER 10-CM LAYER AND THE LOWEST IN DEEPER SOIL LAYERS, INDICATING THAT PLANT EXUDATES ARE THE MAIN SOURCE OF ENERGY FOR HETEROTROPHIC SOIL MICROBES AND THAT METHANOGENESIS IN DEEPER LAYERS IS LIMITED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE ORGANIC SUBSTRATES. METHANE OXIDATION WAS ON THE OTHER HAND ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE SOIL PROFILE, SUGGESTING THAT THE POTENTIALLY ACTIVE METHANE OXIDIZING COMMUNITY IS PRESENT DESPITE LOW METHANE PRODUCTION. THE HIGHEST ABUNDANCE AND ACTIVITY OF METHANOTROPHS WAS DETECTED IN THE WATER TABLE FLUCTUATION LAYERS.

THERE IS EVEN LESS LAND MANAGEMENT AND SOIL MOISTURE DATA, WHICH ARE NEEDED TO TRACK CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION ACTIVITIES SINCE SOIL MOISTURE IS ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVERS OF GHG EMISSIONS OF ORGANIC SOILS. INFORMATION IS ALSO NEEDED FOR THE REPORTING OF LAND-BASED ACTIVITIES SUCH AS GRAZING LAND MANAGEMENT OR WETLAND DRAINAGE AND REWETTING OF ORGANIC SOILS. DIFFERENT SPATIAL AND THEMATIC RESOLUTIONS OF LAND-USE DATA PRODUCE INCONSISTENT TIME SERIES WITH A STRONG OVERESTIMATION OF LAND-USE CHANGE (LUC) IF NOT ADEQUATELY ACCOUNTED FOR. OUR AIM WAS TO CREATE A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES OF LAND USE SINCE 1990 THAT IS IN LINE WITH GHG REPORTING UNDER THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL BY COMBINING OFFICIAL CADASTRAL DATA WITH COLOUR-INFRARED AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY USED FOR BIODIVERSITY MONITORING IN SIX FEDERAL STATES IN NORTHERN AND EASTERN GERMANY. WE DEVELOPED A GENERIC HIERARCHICAL CLASSIFICATION BY LAND USE, MANAGEMENT AND DRAINAGE STATUS, AND A TRANSLATION KEY FOR DATA HARMONISATION INTO A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES. THIS TIME SERIES ENABLED THE QUANTIFICATION OF LUC ON ORGANIC SOILS BETWEEN 1992 AND 2013 IN A SPATIALLY EXPLICIT MANNER. FURTHERMORE WE USED THIS TIME SERIES TO DEVELOP INDICATORS FOR CHANGES IN LAND MANAGEMENT AND DRAINAGE TO EVALUATE THE SUCCESS OF PROTECTION STATUSES ON PEATLAND RESTORATION. THE STUDY AREA ENCOMPASSED ONE MILLION HECTARES, HALF OF WHICH HAD SOME TYPE OF LEGAL NATURE PROTECTION STATUS. AREAS WITH NO PROTECTION STATUS TENDED TO BECOME MORE INTENSIVELY FARMED AND DRIER, WHILE HIGHLY PROTECTED AREAS (E.G. NATURA 2000) SHOWED THE OPPOSITE TREND.

THE TRENDS AND DIFFERENCES IN LUC BETWEEN FEDERAL STATES WERE LINKED TO GERMAN REUNIFICATION, CHANGES IN THE EUROPEAN COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY (CAP) AND GERMANY'S RENEWABLE ENERGY ACT (EEG).

EQUIVALENT SOIL GAS-PHASE CONCENTRATIONS OF N2O AT GRASSLAND SITES VARIED BETWEEN 0 AND 25 MU L L-1 EXCEPT FOR A SAMPLING AFTER SLURRY APPLICATION AT ONE OF THE SITES IN SPRING, WITH A MAXIMUM OF 560 MU L L-1 AT THE 1 M DEPTH. AT THE TWO POTATO SITES THE LEVELS OF BELOW-GROUND N2O CONCENTRATIONS RANGED FROM 0.4 TO 2270 MU L L-1 AND FROM 0.1 TO 470 MU L L-1, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HIGHER SOIL MINERAL N AVAILABILITY AT ARABLE SITES. STATISTICAL ANALYSES USING GRAPHICAL MODELS SHOWED THAT SOIL N2O CONCENTRATION IN THE CAPILLARY FRINGE (I.E. THE SOIL VOLUME ABOVE THE WATER TABLE INFLUENCED BY TENSION SATURATION) WAS THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR OF N2O EMISSIONS IN SPRING AND, FOR GRASSLAND SITES, ALSO IN THE AUTUMN. FOR POTATO SITES IN AUTUMN, THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT NO3- AVAILABILITY IN THE TOPSOIL AND TEMPERATURE WERE THE MAIN CONTROLS ON N2O EMISSIONS. CHEMICAL ANALYSES OF INTACT SOIL CORES FROM THE 0 TO 1M DEPTH, COLLECTED AT ADJACENT GRASSLAND AND POTATO SITES, SHOWED THAT THE TOTAL REDUCTION CAPACITY OF THE PEAT SOIL (ASSESSED BY CERIUM(IV) REDUCTION) WAS MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT REPRESENTED BY FES2, AND THE CONCENTRATIONS OF TOTAL REACTIVE IRON (TRFE) WERE HIGHER THAN THOSE OF FES2. BASED ON THE STATISTICAL GRAPHICAL MODELS AND THE TENTATIVE ESTIMATES OF REDUCTION CAPACITIES, FES2 OXIDATION WAS UNLIKELY TO BE IMPORTANT FOR N2O EMISSIONS.

NIGHTTIME CH4 EMISSIONS WERE GREATER THAN DAYTIME EMISSIONS DURING THE EARLY GROWING SEASON, POSSIBLY DUE TO THE HYDRODYNAMIC TRANSPORT ASSOCIATED WITH SOIL TEMPERATURE INSTABILITY AT NIGHT. THE ANNUAL CH4 EMISSIONS WERE HIGH WHEN THE DISSOLVED OXYGEN CONCENTRATION AT 10 CM WAS LOW AND THE ANNUAL CO2 SINK WAS GREAT, SUGGESTING THE IMPORTANCE OF ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS AND SUBSTRATE AVAILABILITY, WHICH FACILITATE CH4 PRODUCTION AND RESTRICT CH4 OXIDATION.

TO FIND THE SOURCE OF HIGH CH4 EMISSIONS AFTER REWETTING AND TO EXPLORE THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY OF PEATLAND RESTORATION (I.E., LOW CH4 EMISSIONS AFTER REWETTING) UNDER NEAR-NATURAL CONDITIONS, WE INSTALLED A FIELD TRIAL IN A DRAINED BOG IN NORTH-WESTERN GERMANY.

IN ADDITION, WE INVESTIGATED CH4 PRODUCTION POTENTIAL BY INCUBATING SOIL SAMPLES AND DETERMINING METHANOGEN ABUNDANCE BY QUANTITATIVE PCR. COMPARED TO REWETTING ON THE ORIGINAL SURFACE, CH4 EMISSIONS WERE REDUCED ON TSR PLOTS BY FACTOR 30 TO 400. SPREADING OF SPHAGNUM SPP. HAD ONLY LITTLE EFFECT ON CH4 EMISSIONS DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF ESTABLISHMENT. TSR ALSO REDUCED CH4 PRODUCTION POTENTIAL AND METHANOGEN ABUNDANCE. FURTHER, THE RESPONSE OF CH4 FLUXES TO METHANOGEN ABUNDANCE WAS LOWER AFTER TSR.

PLANT GROWTH, PEAT AND POREWATER DISSOLVED C (DOC) AND N (TDN), MICROBIAL BIOMASS AND THE EMISSIONS OF CO2 AND CH4 WERE MONITORED AT THE PLOTS THROUGHOUT THE GROWING SEASON. RESULTS THE LARGEST CONCENTRATIONS OF DOC WERE MEASURED IN DRY AND BARE SITES. LOWER E2:E3 RATIOS SUGGESTED A HIGHER AROMATICITY OF THE DOC AT THESE SITES THAT WERE NET SOURCES OF CO2 AND CH4.

LARGE PARTS OF THE SOIL PROFILE IN NATURAL PEATLANDS ARE WATER SATURATED, LEADING TO ANOXIC CONDITIONS AND TO A DIMINISHED DECOMPOSITION OF PLANT LITTER. IN FUNCTIONING PEATLANDS, THE RATE OF CARBON FIXATION BY PLANT PHOTOSYNTHESIS IS LARGER THAN THE DECOMPOSITION RATE OF DEAD ORGANIC MATERIAL. OVER TIME, THE AMOUNT OF CARBON THAT REMAINS IN THE SOIL AND IS NOT CONVERTED BACK TO CARBON DIOXIDE GROWS. LAND USE OF PEATLANDS OFTEN GOES ALONG WITH WATER LEVEL MANIPULATIONS AND THEREBY WITH ALTERATIONS OF CARBON FLUX DYNAMICS. IN THIS STUDY, CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) AND METHANE (CH4) FLUX MEASUREMENTS FROM A BOG SITE IN NORTHWESTERN GERMANY THAT HAS BEEN HEAVILY DEGRADED BY PEAT MINING ARE PRESENTED. TWO CONTRASTING TYPES OF MANAGEMENT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT THE SITE: (1) DRAINAGE DURING ONGOING PEAT HARVESTING ON ONE HALF OF THE CENTRAL BOG AREA AND (2) REWETTING ON THE OTHER HALF THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF USE SHORTLY BEFORE MEASUREMENTS COMMENCED.

BELOW-GROUND TOTAL AND HETEROTROPHIC RESPIRATION WERE MEASURED AND AUTOTROPHIC RESPIRATION ESTIMATED FROM THE VEGETATED HAGGS. THE MEAN WATER TABLE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE PEAT PANS THAN IN THE VEGETATED HAGGS; BECAUSE OF THIS, AND THE SWITCHING FROM SUBMERGED TO DRY PEAT, THERE WERE DIFFERENCES IN VEGETATION COMPOSITION, PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION. IN THE PEAT PANS PHOTOSYNTHETIC CO2 UPTAKE AND ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION WERE GREATER THAN IN THE VEGETATED HAGGS AND STRONGLY DEPENDENT ON THE DEPTH TO WATER TABLE (R(2)>0.78, P<0.001).

AUTOTROPHIC AND TOTAL BELOW-GROUND RESPIRATION IN THE VEGETATED HAGGS VARIED WITH SOIL TEMPERATURE; HETEROTROPHIC RESPIRATION INCREASED AS WATER TABLES FELL. AN EMPIRICALLY DERIVED NET ECOSYSTEM MODEL ESTIMATED THAT OVER THE TWO GROWING SEASONS BOTH THE VEGETATED HAGGS (29 AND 20GCM(-2); 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS OF -570 TO 762 AND -873 TO 1105 GCM(-2)) AND THE PEAT PANS (7 AND 8GCM(-2); 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS OF -147 TO 465 AND -136 TO 436GCM(-2)) WERE MOST LIKELY NET CO2 SOURCES.

TO ASSESS THE MAGNITUDES OF DAILY AND SEASONAL VARIATIONS IN CH4 FLUX IN THIS AREA, AND TO IDENTIFY THE INFLUENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, AN EDDY COVARIANCE (EC) TOWER WITH A LI-7700 OPEN-PATH CH4 ANALYZER WAS ESTABLISHED ON HONGYUAN PEATLAND. TOTAL ANNUAL CH4 EMISSION WAS 46.8 G CH(4)M(-2) IN 2014, WITH EMISSIONS IN THE NON-GROWING SEASON ACCOUNTING FOR 25% OF THE ANNUAL TOTAL. FROM MAY TO SEPTEMBER 2014, DIURNAL VARIATION IN CH4 EMISSIONS WAS OBSERVED, WITH CH4 FLUXES VARYING BETWEEN 0.15 AND 0.25 MU MOLM(-2) S(-1). IN CONTRAST, DURING ALL OTHER PERIODS OF 2014, NO DIURNAL VARIATION WAS OBSERVED, AND CH4 FLUX VARIED BELOW 0.05 MU MOL M(-2) S(-1). A CLEAR SEASONAL PATTERN IN CH4 EXCHANGE WITH SMALL SURGES IN CH4 EMISSION APPEARED IN SOIL THAWING AND FREEZING SEASONS. WAVELET ANALYSIS WAS APPLIED TO THE CONTINUOUS CH4 FLUX TIME SERIES TO EXPLORE TEMPORAL VARIATION IN ECOSYSTEM CH4 EXCHANGE DURING THE GROWING SEASON. ON DAILY TIMESCALES, CHANGES IN CH4 FLUX ARE IN PHASE WITH CHANGES IN AIR TEMPERATURE, AND INFLUENCED BY FRICTION VELOCITY AND VAPOR PRESSURE DEFICIT (VPD). ON WEEKLY-TO-MONTHLY TIMESCALES, SOIL TEMPERATURE CAN EXPLAIN MOST OF THE VARIATION IN CH4 EXCHANGE. THOUGH CH4 FLUXES HAD NO APPARENT CORRELATION WITH WATER TABLE LEVEL, FLUXES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY (R-2 = 0.86) CORRELATED WITH SOIL TEMPERATURE MEASURED AT -25 CM DEPTH, CLOSE TO THE WATER TABLE LEVEL THROUGHOUT THE GROWING SEASON, SUGGESTING A SYNERGISTIC EFFECT OF WATER TABLE LEVEL AND SOIL TEMPERATURE ON METHANE EMISSION. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR CONTINUOUS EDDY COVARIANCE MEASUREMENTS AND TIME SERIES ANALYSIS APPROACHES TO ADEQUATELY DESCRIBE TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN ECOSYSTEM CH4 EXCHANGE.","MULTI-SCALE TEMPORAL VARIATION IN METHANE EMISSION FROM AN ALPINE PEATLAND ON THE EASTERN QINGHAI-TIBETAN PLATEAU AND ASSOCIATED ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS","AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY","ARTICLE","OCT 15",2019,"10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.107616","AGRONOMY; FORESTRY; METEOROLOGY & ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES","WOS:000500195900014"

IT TRACKS THE GROWTH, TURNOVER AND DECAY IN ANNUAL TIME STEPS OF DIFFERENT VEGETATION COMPONENTS (FOLIAGE, BRANCHES, STEMS, AND ROOTS OF TREES, SHRUBS, SEDGES AND MOSSES). IT USES A Q(10) RELATIONSHIP TO MODEL PEAT C POOL DECOMPOSITION AS A FUNCTION OF MEAN ANNUAL TEMPERATURE, AND MODELS METHANE FLUX RESPONSE TO DEVIATIONS IN ANNUAL WATER TABLE DEPTH.

THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE EXCHANGE OF REACTIVE NITROGEN GASES WITH THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE ACCURACY. THIS STUDY GIVES INSIGHT INTO THE PERFORMANCE OF FLUX CORRECTION METHODS AND THEIR USABILITY FOR REACTIVE NITROGEN GASES. THE EDDY-COVARIANCE (EC) TECHNIQUE IS TODAY WIDELY USED IN EXPERIMENTAL FIELD STUDIES TO MEASURE LAND SURFACE-ATMOSPHERE EXCHANGE OF A VARIETY OF TRACE GASES. IN RECENT YEARS, APPLYING THE EC TECHNIQUE TO REACTIVE NITROGEN COMPOUNDS HAS BECOME MORE IMPORTANT SINCE ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN DEPOSITION INFLUENCES THE PRODUCTIVITY AND BIODIVERSITY OF (SEMI)NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS AND THEIR CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EXCHANGE. FLUXES, WHICH ARE CALCULATED BY EC, HAVE TO BE CORRECTED FOR SETUP-SPECIFIC EFFECTS LIKE ATTENUATION IN THE HIGH-FREQUENCY RANGE. HOWEVER, COMMON METHODS FOR CORRECTING SUCH FLUX LOSSES ARE MAINLY OPTIMIZED FOR INERT GREENHOUSE GASES LIKE CO2 AND METHANE OR WATER VAPOR. IN THIS STUDY, WE APPLIED A SELECTION OF CORRECTION METHODS TO MEASUREMENTS OF TOTAL REACTIVE NITROGEN (SIGMA N-R) CONDUCTED IN DIFFERENT ECOSYSTEMS USING THE TOTAL REACTIVE ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN CONVERTER (TRANC) COUPLED TO A CHEMILUMINESCENCE DETECTOR (CLD). AVERAGE FLUX LOSSES CALCULATED BY METHODS USING MEASURED COSPECTRA AND OGIVES WERE APPROXIMATELY 26 %-38% FOR A SEMINATURAL PEATLAND AND ABOUT 16 %-22% FOR A MIXED FOREST. THE INVESTIGATION OF THE DIFFERENT METHODS SHOWED THAT DAMPING FACTORS CALCULATED WITH MEASURED HEAT AND GAS FLUX COSPECTRA USING AN EMPIRICAL SPECTRAL TRANSFER FUNCTION WERE MOST RELIABLE. FLUX LOSSES OF SIGMA N-R WITH THIS METHOD WERE ON THE UPPER END OF THE MEDIAN DAMPING RANGE, I.E., 38% FOR THE PEATLAND SITE AND 22% FOR THE FOREST SITE.

MATERIALS AND METHODS INCUBATION OF HIGH-MOOR PEAT SOILS COLLECTED FROM MARSH VEGETATION AND DWARF BAMBOO WAS CONDUCTED FOR 108 DAYS AT EACH TEMPERATURE OF 25 DEGREES C AND 35 DEGREES C. THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ALKALINE EXTRACT AND DOM IN SOIL SAMPLES DURING INCUBATION WERE ANALYZED BY TETRAMETHYLAMMONIUM HYDROXIDE THERMOCHEMOLYSIS-GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROMETRY (TMAH-GC/MS) AND FLUORESCENCE ANALYSIS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION THE CUMULATIVE CO2 EMISSION FROM PEAT UNDER DWARF BAMBOO WAS HIGHER THAN THAT OF PEAT UNDER MARSH VEGETATION. DURING INCUBATION AT 35 DEGREES C, PLANT AND MICROBIAL RESIDUES IN DOM EXTRACTED FROM DWARF BAMBOO SOIL WERE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AT THE EARLY STAGES OF CULTURE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE COMPONENTS OF DOM IN THE MARSH VEGETATION SOIL SAMPLE DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE BETWEEN INCUBATION AT EACH TEMPERATURE.

OUR PROCEDURE WAS DEVELOPED AND TESTED IN A LARGE RIVER BASIN IN FINLAND, PROVIDING INFORMATION FROM INTENSIVELY STUDIED ELTER RESEARCH SITES. TO EVALUATE THE FULL GHG BALANCE, FLUXES FROM NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS (LAKES, RIVERS, AND UNDRAINED MIRES) WERE INCLUDED TOGETHER WITH FLUXES FROM ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES, AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY. WE QUANTIFIED THE FLUXES BASED ON CALCULATIONS WITH AN ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS MODEL (FRES) AND A FOREST GROWTH AND CARBON BALANCE MODEL (PREBAS), AS WELL AS ON EMISSION COEFFICIENTS FROM THE LITERATURE REGARDING EMISSIONS FROM LAKES, RIVERS, UNDRAINED MIRES, PEAT EXTRACTION SITES AND CROPLAND. SPATIAL DATA SOURCES INCLUDED CORINE LAND USE DATA, SOIL MAP, LAKE AND RIVER SHORELINES, NATIONAL FOREST INVENTORY DATA, AND STATISTICAL DATA ON ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES. EMISSION UNCERTAINTIES WERE EVALUATED WITH MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS. ARTIFICIAL SURFACES WERE THE MOST EMISSION INTENSIVE LAND-COVER CLASS. LAKES AND RIVERS WERE ABOUT AS EMISSION INTENSIVE AS ARABLE LAND.

THE DUTCH LAND AND WATER AUTHORITIES PROPOSED THE APPLICATION OF SUBSOIL IRRIGATION (SSI) SYSTEM ON A LARGE SCALE TO POTENTIALLY REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS, WHILE MAINTAINING HIGH BIOMASS PRODUCTION. BASED ON MODEL RESULTS, THE EXPECTATION WAS THAT SSI WOULD REDUCE PEAT DECOMPOSITION IN SUMMER BY PREVENTING GROUNDWATER TABLES (GWTS) FROM DROPPING BELOW -60 CM. IN 2017-2018, WE EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF SSI ON GHG EMISSIONS (CO2, CH4, N2O) FOR FOUR DAIRY FARMS ON DRAINED PEAT MEADOWS IN THE NETHERLANDS. EACH FARM HAD A TREATMENT SITE WITH SSI INSTALLATION AND A CONTROL SITE DRAINED ONLY BY DITCHES (DITCH WATER LEVEL -60 / -90 CM, 100 M DISTANCE BETWEEN DITCHES). THE SSI SYSTEM CONSISTED OF PERFORATED PIPES -70 CM FROM SURFACE LEVEL WITH SPACING OF 5-6 M TO IMPROVE DRAINAGE DURING WINTER-SPRING AND IRRIGATION IN SUMMER. GHG EMISSIONS WERE MEASURED USING CLOSED CHAMBERS EVERY 2-4 WEEKS FOR CO2, CH4 AND N2O. MEASURED ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION (R-ECO) ONLY SHOWED A SMALL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SSI AND CONTROL SITES WHEN THE GWT OF SSI SITES WERE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN THE CONTROL SITE (> 20 CM DIFFERENCE). OVER ALL YEARS AND LOCATIONS, HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FOUND, DESPITE THE 6-18 CM HIGHER GWT IN SUMMER AND 1-20 CM LOWER GWT IN WET CONDITIONS AT SSI SITES. DIFFERENCES IN MEAN ANNUAL GWT REMAINED LOW (< 5 CM). DIRECT COMPARISON OF MEASURED N2O AND CH4 FLUXES BETWEEN SSI AND CONTROL SITES DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES. CO2 FLUXES VARIED ACCORDING TO TEMPERATURE AND MANAGEMENT EVENTS, WHILE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CONTROL AND SSI SITES REMAINED SMALL. THEREFORE, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ANNUAL GAP-FILLED NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE (NEE) OF THE SSI AND CONTROL SITES. THE NET ECOSYSTEM CARBON BALANCE (NECB) WAS ON AVERAGE 40 AND 30 T CO2 HA(-1) YR(-1) IN 2017 AND 2018 ON THE SSI SITES AND 38 AND 34 T CO2 HA(-1) YR(-1 )IN 2017 AND 2018 ON THE CONTROL SITES. THIS LACK OF SSI EFFECT IS PROBABLY BECAUSE THE GWT INCREASE REMAINS LIMITED TO DEEPER SOIL LAYERS (60-120 CM DEPTH), WHICH CONTRIBUTE LITTLE TO PEAT OXIDATION. WE CONCLUDE THAT SSI MODULATES WATER TABLE DYNAMICS BUT FAILS TO LOWER ANNUAL CARBON EMISSION. SSI SEEMS UNSUITABLE AS A CLIMATE MITIGATION STRATEGY. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD FOCUS ON POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF GWT MANIPULATION IN THE UPPERMOST ORGANIC LAYERS (-30 CM AND HIGHER) ON GHG EMISSIONS FROM DRAINED PEATLANDS.","CONVENTIONAL SUBSOIL IRRIGATION TECHNIQUES DO NOT LOWER CARBON EMISSIONS FROM DRAINED PEAT MEADOWS","BIOGEOSCIENCES","ARTICLE","JUN 29",2021,"10.5194/bg-18-3881-2021","ECOLOGY; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000668605300003"

THIS DESIGN PROVIDES AN ENVIRONMENT FAVORABLE FOR DENITRIFICATION AND THUS A DECREASE IN NITRATE CONCENTRATION IS EXPECTED AS WATER FLOW THROUGH THE IBZ. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS, THERE IS A RISK FOR INCREASING EMISSIONS OF THE GREENHOUSE GASES NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) AND METHANE (CH4). IN THIS YEAR-LONG STUDY, WE EVALUATED THE N REMOVAL EFFICIENCY ALONG WITH THE RISK OF N2O AND CH4 EMISSIONS FROM TWO PILOT-SCALE IBZS (IBZ1 AND 2). THE TWO IBZS HAD VERY DIFFERENT YEARLY REMOVAL EFFICIENCIES, AMOUNTING TO 29% AND 71% OF THE TOTAL N LOAD AT IBZ1 AND 2, RESPECTIVELY. THIS WAS PROBABLY DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN INFILTRATION RATES TO THE FILTERBED, WHICH WAS 22% AND 81% OF THE INCOMING WATER AT IBZ1 AND 2, RESPECTIVELY. THE SITE (IBZ2) WITH THE HIGHEST REMOVAL EFFICIENCY WAS A NET N2O SINK, WHILE 0.9% OF THE REMOVED NITRATE WAS EMITTED AS N2O AT IBZ1.

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO QUANTIFY THE SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF THE FOREST FLOOR CH4 FLUX WITH A TOPOGRAPHY-BASED UPSCALING METHOD CONNECTING THE FLUX WITH ITS DRIVING FACTORS. WE CONDUCTED SPATIALLY EXTENSIVE FOREST FLOOR CH4 FLUX AND SOIL MOISTURE MEASUREMENTS, COMPLEMENTED BY GROUND VEGETATION CLASSIFICATION, IN A BOREAL PINE FOREST. WE THEN MODELLED THE SOIL MOISTURE WITH A RANDOM FOREST MODEL USING DIGITAL-ELEVATION-MODEL-DERIVED TOPOGRAPHIC INDICES, BASED ON WHICH WE UPSCALED THE FOREST FLOOR CH4 FLUX. THE MODELLING WAS PERFORMED FOR TWO SEASONS: MAY-JULY AND AUGUST-OCTOBER. ADDITIONALLY, WE EVALUATED THE NUMBER OF FLUX MEASUREMENT POINTS NEEDED TO GET AN ACCURATE ESTIMATE OF THE FLUX AT THE WHOLE STUDY SITE MERELY BY AVERAGING. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE HIGH SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY IN THE FOREST FLOOR CH4 FLUX RESULTING FROM THE SOIL MOISTURE VARIABILITY AS WELL AS FROM THE RELATED GROUND VEGETATION. THE MEAN MEASURED CH4 FLUX AT THE SAMPLE POINTS WAS -5.07 MU MOL M(-2) H(-1) IN MAY-JULY AND -8.67 MU MOL M(-2) H(-1) IN AUGUST-OCTOBER, WHILE THE MODELLED FLUX FOR THE WHOLE AREA WAS -7.42 AND -9.91 MU MOL M(-2) H(-1) FOR THE TWO SEASONS, RESPECTIVELY. THE SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN THE SOIL MOISTURE AND CONSEQUENTLY IN THE CH4 FLUX WAS HIGHER IN THE EARLY SUMMER (MODELLED RANGE FROM -12.3 TO 6.19 MU MOL M(-2) H(-1)) COMPARED TO THE AUTUMN PERIOD (RANGE FROM -14.6 TO -2.12 MU MOL M(-2)H(-1)), AND OVERALL THE CH4 UPTAKE RATE WAS HIGHER IN AUTUMN COMPARED TO EARLY SUMMER. IN THE EARLY SUMMER THERE WERE PATCHES EMITTING HIGH AMOUNTS OF CH4; HOWEVER, THESE WET PATCHES GOT DRIER AND SMALLER IN SIZE TOWARDS THE AUTUMN, CHANGING THEIR DYNAMICS TO CH4 UPTAKE.

TO THIS PURPOSE, A NOVEL INTEGRATED ENERGY SYSTEM IS INTRODUCED. THE BOIL OFF GAS (BOG) FROM LNG TANKS IS EXPLOITED IN A COMBINED PLANT, WHERE HEAT AND POWER ARE PRODUCED BY A REGENERATED GAS TURBINE CYCLE; AT THE SAME TIME, COLD EXERGY FROM LNG REGASIFICATION CONTRIBUTES TO AN INCREASE IN THE EFFICIENCY OF A VAPOR COMPRESSION REFRIGERATION CYCLE. IN THE PAPER, THE INTEGRATED ENERGY SYSTEM IS SIMULATED BY MEANS OF DYNAMIC MODELING UNDER DAILY VARIABLE WORKING CONDITIONS. RESULTS CONFIRM THAT THE MODEL IS STABLE AND ABLE TO DETERMINE THE TIME BEHAVIOR OF THE INTEGRATED PLANT. ENERGY SAVING IS EVALUATED, AND DAILY TRENDS OF KEY THERMOPHYSICAL PARAMETERS ARE REPORTED AND DISCUSSED. THE ANALYSIS OF THERMAL RECOVERING FROM THE FLUE GASES SHOWS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO RECOVER A LARGE ENERGY SHARE FROM THE TURBINE EXHAUSTS. HENCE, THE SYSTEM CAN GENERATE ELECTRICITY FOR PORT COLD IRONING AND, THROUGH A SECONDARY BRINE LOOP, COLD EXERGY FOR A REFRIGERATION PLANT.

SCHMIDT MWI, 2000, GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEM CY;"SCHMIDT MWI;NOACK AG";THIS REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS THE UBIQUITY OF BLACK CARBON (BC) PRODUCED BY INCOMPLETE COMBUSTION OF PLANT MATERIAL AND FOSSIL FUELS IN PEATS, SOILS, AND LACUSTRINE AND MARINE SEDIMENTS. WE EXAMINE VARIOUS DEFINITIONS AND ANALYTICAL APPROACHES AND SEEK TO PROVIDE A COMMON LANGUAGE. BC REPRESENTS A CONTINUUM FROM PARTLY CHARRED MATERIAL TO GRAPHITE AND SOOT PARTICLES, WITH NO GENERAL AGREEMENT ON CLEAR-CUT BOUNDARIES. FORMATION OF BC CAN OCCUR IN TWO FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT WAYS. VOLATILES RECONDENSE TO HIGHLY GRAPHITIZED SOOT-BC, WHEREAS THE SOLID RESIDUES FORM CHAR-BC. BOTH FORMS OF BC ARE RELATIVELY INERT AND ARE DISTRIBUTED GLOBALLY BY WATER AND WIND VIA FLUVIAL AND ATMOSPHERIC TRANSPORT. WE SUMMARIZE, CHRONOLOGICALLY, THE UBIQUITY OF BC IN SOILS AND SEDIMENTS SINCE DEVONIAN TIMES, DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN BC FROM VEGETATION FIRES AND FROM FOSSIL FUEL COMBUSTION. BC HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR VARIOUS BIOLOGICAL, GEOCHEMICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES. AS EXAMPLES, BC MAY REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT SINK IN THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE, AFFECT THE EARTH'S RADIATIVE HEAT BALANCE, BE A USEFUL TRACER FOR EARTH'S FIRE HISTORY, BUILD UP A SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF CARBON BURIED IN SOILS AND SEDIMENTS, AND CARRY ORGANIC POLLUTANTS. ON LAND, BC SEEMS TO BE ABUNDANT IN DARK-COLORED SOILS, AFFECTED BY FREQUENT VEGETATION BURNING AND FOSSIL FUEL COMBUSTION, THUS PROBABLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE HIGHLY STABLE AROMATIC COMPONENTS OF SOIL ORGANIC MATTER. WE DISCUSS CHALLENGES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. DESPITE THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF BC, ONLY LIMITED PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN CALIBRATING ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES. PROGRESS IN THE QUANTIFICATION OF BC IS LIKELY TO COME FROM SYSTEMATIC INTERCOMPARISON USING BCS FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES AND IN DIFFERENT NATURAL MATRICES. BC IDENTIFICATION COULD BENEFIT FROM ISOTOPIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC TECHNIQUES APPLIED AT THE BULK AND MOLECULAR LEVELS. THE KEY TO ESTIMATING BC STOCKS IN SOILS AND SEDIMENTS IS AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESSES INVOLVED IN BC DEGRADATION ON A MOLECULAR LEVEL. A PROMISING APPROACH WOULD BE THE COMBINATION OF SHORT-TERM LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS AND LONG-TERM FIELD TRIALS.;BLACK CARBON IN SOILS AND SEDIMENTS: ANALYSIS, DISTRIBUTION, IMPLICATIONS, AND CURRENT CHALLENGES;GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES;REVIEW;SEP;2000;10.1029/1999GB001208;"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY; METEOROLOGY & ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES";WOS:000089089000006
BRIDGHAM SD, 2006, WETLANDS;"BRIDGHAM SD;MEGONIGAL JP;KELLER JK;BLISS NB;TRETTIN C";"WE EXAMINE THE CARBON BALANCE OF NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS BY REVIEWING AND SYNTHESIZING THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE AND SOIL DATABASES. NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS CONTAIN ABOUT 220 PG C, MOST OF WHICH IS IN PEAT. THEY ARE A SMALL TO MODERATE CARBON SINK OF ABOUT 49 TG C YR(-1), ALTHOUGH THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THIS ESTIMATE IS GREATER THAN 100%, WITH THE LARGEST UNKNOWN BEING THE ROLE OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION BY SEDIMENTATION IN FRESHWATER MINERAL-SOIL WETLANDS. WE ESTIMATE THAT NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS EMIT 9 TG METHANE (CH4) YR(-1); HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTY OF THIS ESTIMATE IS ALSO GREATER THAN 100%. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ESTUARINE WETLANDS, CH4 EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS MAY LARGELY OFFSET ANY POSITIVE BENEFITS OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN SOILS AND PLANTS IN TERMS OF CLIMATE FORCING. HISTORICALLY, THE DESTRUCTION OF WETLANDS THROUGH LAND-USE CHANGES HAS HAD THE LARGEST EFFECTS ON THE CARBON FLUXES AND CONSEQUENT RADIATIVE FORCING OF NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS. THE PRIMARY EFFECTS HAVE BEEN A REDUCTION IN THEIR ABILITY TO SEQUESTER CARBON (A SMALL TO MODERATE INCREASE IN RADIATIVE FORCING), OXIDATION OF THEIR SOIL CARBON RESERVES UPON DRAINAGE (A SMALL INCREASE IN RADIATIVE FORCING), AND REDUCTION IN CH4 EMISSIONS (A SMALL TO LARGE DECREASE IN RADIATIVE FORCING). IT IS UNCERTAIN HOW GLOBAL CHANGES WILL AFFECT THE CARBON POOLS AND FLUXES OF NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS. WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PREDICT ACCURATELY THE ROLE OF WETLANDS AS POTENTIAL POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE FEEDBACKS TO ANTHROPOGENIC GLOBAL CHANGE WITHOUT KNOWING THE INTEGRATIVE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE CONCENTRATIONS, AND ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION OF NITROGEN AND SULFUR ON THE CARBON BALANCE OF NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS.";THE CARBON BALANCE OF NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS;WETLANDS;REVIEW;DEC;2006;"10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[889:TCBONA]2.0.CO;2";"ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES";WOS:000243370000002
BRIDGHAM SD, 2013, GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL;"BRIDGHAM SD;CADILLO-QUIROZ H;KELLER JK;ZHUANG QL";UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMICS OF METHANE (CH4) EMISSIONS IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE BECAUSE CH4 HAS 25 TIMES THE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL OF CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) AND IS CURRENTLY THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT ANTHROPOGENIC GREENHOUSE GAS. WETLANDS ARE THE SINGLE LARGEST NATURAL CH4 SOURCE WITH MEDIAN EMISSIONS FROM PUBLISHED STUDIES OF 164 TGYR1, WHICH IS ABOUT A THIRD OF TOTAL GLOBAL EMISSIONS. WE PROVIDE A PERSPECTIVE ON IMPORTANT NEW FRONTIERS IN OBTAINING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF CH4 DYNAMICS IN NATURAL SYSTEMS, WITH A FOCUS ON WETLANDS. ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS FIELD IS THE ATTEMPT TO INTEGRATE THE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES AND SPATIAL SCALES OF BIOGEOCHEMISTRY, MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY, AND MODELING, AND THUS THIS IS A MAJOR FOCUS OF THIS REVIEW. OUR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE TO PROVIDE AN UP-TO-DATE SYNTHESIS OF ESTIMATES OF GLOBAL CH4 EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS AND OTHER FRESHWATER AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS, BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE MAJOR BIOGEOPHYSICAL CONTROLS OVER CH4 EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS, SUGGEST NEW FRONTIERS IN CH4 BIOGEOCHEMISTRY, EXAMINE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN METHANOGEN COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND CH4 DYNAMICS IN SITU, AND TO REVIEW THE CURRENT GENERATION OF CH4 MODELS. WE HIGHLIGHT THROUGHOUT SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES CONCERNING GLOBAL CHANGE AND FEEDBACKS ON CH4 EMISSIONS FROM NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS. MAJOR UNCERTAINTIES IN ESTIMATING CURRENT AND FUTURE CH4 EMISSIONS FROM NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: (I) A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT CONTROLS OVER CH4 PRODUCTION, CONSUMPTION, AND TRANSPORT HAVE NOT BEEN, OR ARE INADEQUATELY, INCORPORATED INTO EXISTING CH4 BIOGEOCHEMISTRY MODELS. (II) SIGNIFICANT ERRORS IN REGIONAL AND GLOBAL EMISSION ESTIMATES ARE DERIVED FROM LARGE SPATIAL-SCALE EXTRAPOLATIONS FROM HIGHLY HETEROGENEOUS AND OFTEN POORLY MAPPED WETLAND COMPLEXES. (III) THE LIMITED NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS OF CH4 FLUXES AND THEIR ASSOCIATED ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES LOOSELY CONSTRAINS THE PARAMETERIZATION OF PROCESS-BASED BIOGEOCHEMISTRY MODELS.;METHANE EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS: BIOGEOCHEMICAL, MICROBIAL, AND MODELING PERSPECTIVES FROM LOCAL TO GLOBAL SCALES;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY;REVIEW;MAY;2013;10.1111/gcb.12131;"BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES";WOS:000317284700001
PRESTON CM, 2006, BIOGEOSCIENCES;"PRESTON CM;SCHMIDT MWI";THE CARBON (C) CYCLE IN BOREAL REGIONS IS STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY FIRE, WHICH CONVERTS BIOMASS AND DETRITAL C MAINLY TO GASEOUS FORMS (CO2 AND SMALLER PROPORTIONS OF CO AND CH4), AND SOME 1-3% OF MASS TO PYROGENIC C (PYC). PYC IS MAINLY PRODUCED AS SOLID CHARRED RESIDUES, INCLUDING VISUALLY-DEFINED CHARCOAL, AND A BLACK CARBON (BC) FRACTION CHEMICALLY DEFINED BY ITS RESISTANCE TO LABORATORY OXIDATION, PLUS MUCH LOWER PROPORTIONS OF VOLATILE SOOT AND POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS (PAHS). ALL PYC IS CHARACTERIZED BY FUSED AROMATIC RINGS, BUT VARYING IN CLUSTER SIZES, AND PRESENCE OF OTHER ELEMENTS (N, O) AND FUNCTIONAL GROUPS. THE RANGE OF PYC STRUCTURES IS OFTEN DESCRIBED AS A CONTINUUM FROM PARTIALLY CHARRED PLANT MATERIALS, TO CHARCOAL, SOOT AND ULTIMATELY GRAPHITE WHICH IS FORMED BY THE COMBINATION OF HEAT AND PRESSURE. THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR CURRENT INTEREST IN DEFINING MORE PRECISELY THE ROLE OF PYC IN THE C CYCLE OF BOREAL REGIONS. FIRST, PYC IS LARGELY RESISTANT TO DECOMPOSITION, AND THEREFORE CONTRIBUTES TO VERY STABLE C POOLS IN SOILS AND SEDIMENTS. SECOND, IT INFLUENCES SOIL PROCESSES, MAINLY THROUGH ITS SORPTION PROPERTIES AND CATION EXCHANGE CAPACITY, AND THIRD, SOOT AEROSOLS ABSORB SOLAR RADIATION AND MAY CONTRIBUTE TO GLOBAL WARMING. HOWEVER, THERE ARE LARGE GAPS IN THE BASIC INFORMATION NEEDED TO ADDRESS THESE TOPICS. WHILE CHARCOAL IS COMMONLY DEFINED BY VISUAL CRITERIA, ANALYTICAL METHODS FOR BC ARE MAINLY BASED ON VARIOUS MEASURES OF OXIDATION RESISTANCE, OR ON YIELD OF BENZENEPOLYCARBOXYLIC ACIDS. THESE METHODS ARE STILL BEING DEVELOPED, AND CAPTURE DIFFERENT FRACTIONS OF THE PYC STRUCTURAL CONTINUUM. THERE ARE FEW QUANTITATIVE REPORTS OF PYC PRODUCTION AND STOCKS IN BOREAL FORESTS (ESSENTIALLY NONE FOR BOREAL PEATLANDS), AND RESULTS ARE DIFFICULT TO COMPARE DUE TO VARYING EXPERIMENTAL GOALS AND METHODS, AS WELL AS INCONSISTENT TERMINOLOGY. THERE ARE ALMOST NO DIRECT FIELD MEASUREMENTS OF BC AEROSOL PRODUCTION FROM BOREAL WILDFIRES, AND LITTLE DIRECT INFORMATION ON RATES AND MECHANISMS FOR PYC LOSS. STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF CHARRED BIOMASS AND FOREST FLOOR FROM WILDFIRES GENERALLY INDICATES A LOW LEVEL OF THERMAL ALTERATION, WITH THE BULK OF THE MATERIAL HAVING H/C RATIOS STILL > 0.2, AND SMALL AROMATIC CLUSTER SIZES. ESPECIALLY FOR THE MORE OXIDATION-RESISTANT BC FRACTION, A VARIETY OF MAINLY CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS VERY SLOW DECOMPOSITION, WITH TURNOVER ON A MILLENNIAL TIMESCALE (IN THE ORDER OF 5-7 KY), ALSO DEPENDENT ON ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE THAT SOME PYC MAY BE LOST IN ONLY TENS TO HUNDREDS OF YEARS DUE TO A COMBINATION OF LOWER THERMAL ALTERATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THE POTENTIAL FOR LONG-TERM PYC STORAGE IN SOIL MAY ALSO BE LIMITED BY ITS CONSUMPTION BY SUBSEQUENT FIRES. DEGRADED, FUNCTIONALIZED PYC IS ALSO INCORPORATED INTO HUMIFIED SOIL ORGANIC MATTER, AND IS TRANSPORTED EVENTUALLY TO MARINE SEDIMENTS IN DISSOLVED AND PARTICULATE FORM. BOREAL PRODUCTION IS ESTIMATED AS 7-17 TG BC Y(-1) OF SOLID RESIDUES AND 2-2.5 TG BC Y(-1) AS AEROSOLS, COMPARED TO GLOBAL ESTIMATES OF 40-240 AND 10-30TGBCY(-1), RESPECTIVELY. PRIMARY RESEARCH NEEDS INCLUDE BASIC FIELD DATA ON PYC PRODUCTION AND STOCKS IN BOREAL FORESTS AND PEATLANDS, SUITABLE TO SUPPORT C BUDGET MODELING, AND DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDIZED ANALYTICAL METHODS AND OF IMPROVED APPROACHES TO ASSESS THE CHEMICAL RECALCITRANCE OF TYPICAL CHARS FROM BOREAL WILDFIRES. TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS EFFECTIVELY WILL REQUIRE MUCH GREATER EMPHASIS ON INTERDICIPLINARY COOPERATION.;BLACK (PYROGENIC) CARBON: A SYNTHESIS OF CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND UNCERTAINTIES WITH SPECIAL CONSIDERATION OF BOREAL REGIONS;BIOGEOSCIENCES;REVIEW;NA;2006;10.5194/bg-3-397-2006;"ECOLOGY; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY";WOS:000243785300002
LIMPENS J, 2008, BIOGEOSCIENCES;"LIMPENS J;BERENDSE F;BLODAU C;CANADELL JG;FREEMAN C;HOLDEN J;ROULET N;RYDIN H;SCHAEPMAN-STRUB G";PEATLANDS COVER ONLY 3% OF THE EARTH'S LAND SURFACE BUT BOREAL AND SUBARCTIC PEATLANDS STORE ABOUT 15-30% OF THE WORLD'S SOIL CARBON ( C) AS PEAT. DESPITE THEIR POTENTIAL FOR LARGE POSITIVE FEEDBACKS TO THE CLIMATE SYSTEM THROUGH SEQUESTRATION AND EMISSION OF GREENHOUSE GASES, PEATLANDS ARE NOT EXPLICITLY INCLUDED IN GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELS AND THEREFORE IN PREDICTIONS OF FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE. IN APRIL 2007 A SYMPOSIUM WAS HELD IN WAGENINGEN, THE NETHERLANDS, TO ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF PEATLAND C CYCLING. THIS PAPER SYNTHESIZES THE MAIN FINDINGS OF THE SYMPOSIUM, FOCUSING ON (I) SMALL-SCALE PROCESSES, (II) C FLUXES AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE, AND (III) PEATLANDS IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE MAIN DRIVERS CONTROLLING MOST ARE RELATED TO SOME ASPECTS OF HYDROLOGY. DESPITE HIGH SPATIAL AND ANNUAL VARIABILITY IN NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE ( NEE), THE DIFFERENCES IN CUMULATIVE ANNUAL NEE ARE MORE A FUNCTION OF BROAD SCALE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND PHYSICAL SETTING THAN INTERNAL FACTORS, SUGGESTING THE EXISTENCE OF STRONG FEEDBACKS. IN CONTRAST, TRACE GAS EMISSIONS SEEM MAINLY CONTROLLED BY LOCAL FACTORS. KEY UNCERTAINTIES REMAIN CONCERNING THE EXISTENCE OF PERTURBATION THRESHOLDS, THE RELATIVE STRENGTHS OF THE CO2 AND CH4 FEEDBACK, THE LINKS AMONG PEATLAND SURFACE CLIMATE, HYDROLOGY, ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION, AND TRACE GAS BIOGEOCHEMISTRY AS WELL AS THE SIMILARITY OF PROCESS RATES ACROSS PEATLAND TYPES AND CLIMATIC ZONES. PROGRESS ON THESE RESEARCH AREAS CAN ONLY BE REALIZED BY STRONGER CO-OPERATION BETWEEN DISCIPLINES THAT ADDRESS DIFFERENT SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES.;PEATLANDS AND THE CARBON CYCLE: FROM LOCAL PROCESSES TO GLOBAL IMPLICATIONS - A SYNTHESIS;BIOGEOSCIENCES;REVIEW;NA;2008;10.5194/bg-5-1475-2008;"ECOLOGY; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY";WOS:000260557000005
FREY KE, 2009, HYDROL PROCESS;"FREY KE;MCCLELLAND JW";OVER THE NEXT CENTURY, NEAR-SURFACE PERMAFROST ACROSS THE CIRCUMPOLAR ARCTIC IS EXPECTED TO DEGRADE SIGNIFICANTLY. PARTICULARLY FOR LAND AREAS SOUTH OF 70 DEGREES N. THIS IS LIKELY TO CAUSE WIDESPREAD IMPACTS ON ARCTIC HYDROLOGY, ECOLOGY, AND TRACE GAS EMISSIONS. HERE. WE PRESENT A REVIEW OF RECENT STUDIES INVESTIGATING LINKAGES BETWEEN PERMAFROST DYNAMICS AND RIVER BIOGEOCHEMISTRY IN THE ARCTIC, INCLUDING CONSIDERATION OF LIKELY IMPACTS THAT WARMING-INDUCED CHANGES IN PERMAFROST MAY BE HAVING (OR WILL HAVE IN THE FUTURE) OIL THE DELIVERY OF ORGANIC MATTER, INORGANIC NUTRIENTS, AND MAJOR IONS TO THE ARCTIC OCEAN. THESE INTERACTING PROCESSES CAN BE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND UNDOUBTEDLY EXHIBIT SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT PERMAFROST CONDITIONS, SENSITIVITY TO PERMAFROST THAW, MODE OF PERMAFROST DEGRADATION (OVERALL PERMAFROST THAW, ACTIVE LAYER DEEPENING, AND/OR THERMOKARST PROCESSES), AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS OF WATERSHEDS (E.G. LAND COVER, SOIL TYPE, AND TOPOGRAPHY). ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES OF PERMAFROST THAW PROJECTED FOR THE FUTURE IS THAT THE ARCTIC TERRESTRIAL FRESHWATER SYSTEM IS LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE A TRANSITION FROM A SURFACE WATER-DOMINATED SYSTEM TO A GROUNDWATER-DOMINATED SYSTEM. ALONG WITH MANY OTHER CASCADING IMPACTS FROM THIS TRANSITION, MINERAL-RICH GROUNDWATER MAY BECOME AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO STREAMFLOW, IN ADDITION TO THE CURRENTLY DOMINANT CONTRIBUTION FROM MINERAL-POOR SURFACE WATER. MOST STUDIES OBSERVE OR PREDICT AN INCREASE IN MAJOR ION, PHOSPHATE, AND SILICATE EXPORT WITH THIS SHIFT TOWARDS GREATER GROUNDWATER CONTRIBUTIONS. HOWEVER, WE SEE CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS OF WHETHER THE DELIVERY OF INORGANIC NITROGEN AND ORGANIC MATTER WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE WITH WARMING AND PERMAFROST THAW. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT UNCERTAINTIES IN THE PREDICTIONS OF THE TOTAL FLUX OF BIOGEOCHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS ARE TIGHTLY LINKED TO FUTURE UNCERTAINTIES IN DISCHARGE OF RIVERS. NONETHELESS, IT IS CLEAR THAT OVER THE NEXT CENTURY THERE WILL BE IMPORTANT SHIFTS IN THE RIVER TRANSPORT OF ORGANIC MATTER, INORGANIC NUTRIENTS, AND MAJOR IONS. WHICH MAY IN TURN HAVE CRITICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR PRIMARY PRODUCTION AND CARBON CYCLING OIL ARCTIC SHELVES AND IN THE ARCTIC OCEAN BASIN INTERIOR.

KAYRANLI B, 2010, WETLANDS;"KAYRANLI B;SCHOLZ M;MUSTAFA A;HEDMARK A";WE CRITICALLY REVIEW RECENT LITERATURE ON CARBON STORAGE AND FLUXES WITHIN NATURAL AND CONSTRUCTED FRESHWATER WETLANDS, AND SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS CONCERNS OF READERS WORKING IN APPLIED SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING. OUR PURPOSE IS TO REVIEW AND ASSESS THE DISTRIBUTION AND CONVERSION OF CARBON IN THE WATER ENVIRONMENT, PARTICULARLY WITHIN WETLAND SYSTEMS. A KEY AIM IS TO ASSESS IF WETLANDS ARE CARBON SINKS OR SOURCES. CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND FLUXES IN NATURAL AND CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS LOCATED AROUND THE WORLD HAS BEEN ASSESSED. ALL FACETS OF CARBON (SOLID AND GASEOUS FORMS) HAVE BEEN COVERED. WE DRAW CONCLUSIONS BASED ON THESE STUDIES. FINDINGS INDICATE THAT WETLANDS CAN BE BOTH SOURCES AND SINKS OF CARBON, DEPENDING ON THEIR AGE, OPERATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL BOUNDARY CONDITIONS SUCH AS LOCATION AND CLIMATE. SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH NEEDS IN THE AREA OF CARBON STORAGE IN WETLAND SEDIMENTS ARE OUTLINED TO FACILITATE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESSES OF CARBON STORAGE AND REMOVAL AND ALSO THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THEM.;CARBON STORAGE AND FLUXES WITHIN FRESHWATER WETLANDS: A CRITICAL REVIEW;WETLANDS;REVIEW;FEB;2010;10.1007/s13157-009-0003-4;"ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES";WOS:000275642500010
JOABSSON A, 1999, TRENDS ECOL EVOL;"JOABSSON A;CHRISTENSEN TR;WALLEN B";METHANE EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS ARE HIGHLY VARIABLE, BOTH SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY AND AT SCALES RANGING FROM MICROTOPOGRAPHIC TO REGIONAL DIFFERENCES. TO COMPREHEND THIS VARIATION FULLY AND ALSO TO PREDICT RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE, AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTIMATE LINKAGE BETWEEN CARBON CYCLING AND METHANE EMISSION IN THESE SYSTEMS IS NEEDED. THE PRESENCE OF VASCULAR PLANTS HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED RECENTLY AS ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS CONTROLLING THE SCALE OF METHANE FLUXES BECAUSE IT AFFECTS PROCESSES COUPLED TO TRANSPORT, PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF METHANE.

LOCATION GLOBAL MANGROVE ECOSYSTEMS. METHODS WE REVIEW FOUR LONG-STANDING ROLES OF MANGROVES: (1) CARBON DYNAMICS - EXPORT OR SINK; (2) NURSERY ROLE; (3) SHORELINE PROTECTION; (4) LAND-BUILDING CAPACITY. THE ORIGINS OF PERTINENT HYPOTHESES, CURRENT UNDERSTANDING AND GAPS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE ARE HIGHLIGHTED WITH REFERENCE TO BIOGEOGRAPHIC, GEOGRAPHIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC INFLUENCES. RESULTS THE ROLE OF MANGROVES AS C SINKS NEEDS TO BE EVALUATED FOR A WIDE RANGE OF BIOGEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AND FOREST CONDITIONS. MANGROVE C ASSIMILATION MAY BE UNDER-ESTIMATED BECAUSE OF FLAWED METHODOLOGY AND SCANTY DATA ON KEY COMPONENTS OF C DYNAMICS. PERI-URBAN MANGROVES MAY BE MANIPULATED TO PROVIDE LOCAL OFFSETS FOR C EMISSION. THE NURSERY FUNCTION OF MANGROVES IS NOT UBIQUITOUS BUT VARIES WITH SPATIO-TEMPORAL ACCESSIBILITY. CONNECTIVITY AND COMPLEMENTARITY OF MANGROVES AND ADJACENT HABITATS ENHANCE THEIR NURSERY FUNCTION THROUGH TROPHIC RELAY AND ONTOGENETIC MIGRATIONS. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MANGROVES FOR COASTAL PROTECTION DEPENDS ON FACTORS AT LANDSCAPE/GEOMORPHIC TO COMMUNITY SCALES AND LOCAL/SPECIES SCALES. SHIFTS IN SPECIES DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE, FOREST DEGRADATION AND LOSS OF HABITAT CONNECTIVITY MAY REDUCE THE PROTECTIVE CAPACITY OF MANGROVES. EARLY VIEWS OF MANGROVES AS LAND BUILDERS (ESPECIALLY LATERAL EXPANSION) WERE QUESTIONABLE. EVIDENCE NOW INDICATES THAT MANGROVES, ONCE ESTABLISHED, DIRECTLY INFLUENCE VERTICAL LAND DEVELOPMENT BY ENHANCING SEDIMENTATION AND/OR BY DIRECT ORGANIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOIL VOLUME (PEAT FORMATION) IN SOME SETTINGS. MAIN CONCLUSIONS KNOWLEDGE OF THRESHOLDS, SPATIO-TEMPORAL SCALING AND VARIABILITY DUE TO GEOGRAPHIC, BIOGEOGRAPHIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC SETTINGS WILL IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT OF MANGROVE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES.

BELYEA LR, 2006, ECOL MONOGR;"BELYEA LR;BAIRD AJ";THE POSTGLACIAL DEVELOPMENT OF PEATLAND SYSTEMS HAS HAD A STRONG INFLUENCE ON THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE. PEATLAND EFFECTS ON CARBON CYCLING INVOLVE CHANGES IN BOTH LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. THE RATE OF C SEQUESTRATION DECLINES AS A PEAT DEPOSIT GROWS, AND METHANE EMISSION INCREASES AS WET MICROHABITATS EXPAND IN AREA. WE EXAMINE THE THEORETICAL BASIS, UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR TWO HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL MODELS OF PEATLAND FORM AND DEVELOPMENT: CLYMO'S BOG GROWTH MODEL (BGM) AND INGRAM'S GROUNDWATER MOUND HYPOTHESIS (GMH). OUR DETAILED THEORETICAL ANALYSIS REVEALS PREVIOUSLY UNRECOGNIZED CONSEQUENCES OF THE MODELS AND, FOR THE BGM, UNREALISTICALLY STRINGENT CONDITIONS FOR APPLICATION. OUR REVIEW OF MODEL ASSUMPTIONS AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IDENTIFIES THE PRINCIPAL LIMITATIONS OF THESE MODELS: THEY IGNORE SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY IN PEATLAND STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION, FAST PROCESSES OCCURRING NEAR THE PEATLAND SURFACE, AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PEAT ACCUMULATION AND HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. AS A RESULT, THESE MODELS ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE EFFECTS OF BOG GROWTH ON HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS OR PEAT-FORMING PROCESSES. WE INTRODUCE FIVE CONCEPTUAL MODELS OF PEATLAND DEVELOPMENT THAT DIFFER IN HOW BOG SIZE AND SHAPE CHANGE OVER TIME, AND WE EXAMINE THE CONSEQUENCES OF EACH MODEL FOR HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. THIS EXERCISE SHOWS HOW BOG HEIGHT GROWTH AND LATERAL EXPANSION CHANGE THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS CONSTRAINING PEATLAND DYNAMICS, AND SO DETERMINE THE DIRECTION OF ECOSYSTEM DEVELOPMENT. WE LINK PEATLAND PROPERTIES TO THE FOUR GENERAL PROPERTIES OF ''COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS'' (CAS): SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY, LOCALIZED FLOWS, SELF-ORGANIZING STRUCTURE AND NONLINEARITY. WE ALSO PRESENT A FRAMEWORK FOR MODELING PEATLANDS AS CAS. IN THIS FRAMEWORK, THE SYSTEM IS DISAGGREGATED, BOTH VERTICALLY AND HORIZONTALLY, INTO A SET OF COMPONENTS THAT INTERACT LOCALLY THROUGH FLOWS OF ENERGY AND RESOURCES. BOTH INTERNAL DYNAMICS AND EXTERNAL FORCING DRIVE CHANGES IN HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND MICROHABITAT PATTERN, AND THESE AUTOGENIC AND ALLOGENIC CHANGES IN PEATLAND STRUCTURE AFFECT HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES, WHICH, IN TURN, CONSTRAIN PEATLAND DEVELOPMENT AND CARBON CYCLING.

LAI DYF, 2009, PEDOSPHERE;LAI DYF;NORTHERN PEATLANDS STORE A LARGE AMOUNT OF CARBON AND PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE. OWING TO THE PRESENCE OF WATERLOGGED AND ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS, PEATLANDS ARE TYPICALLY A SOURCE OF METHANE (CH4), A VERY POTENT GREENHOUSE GAS. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE KEY MECHANISMS OF PEATLAND CH4 PRODUCTION, CONSUMPTION AND TRANSPORT AND THE MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND BIOTIC CONTROLS ON PEATLAND CH4 EMISSIONS. THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF MICROMETEOROLOGICAL AND CHAMBER METHODS IN MEASURING CH4 FLUXES FROM NORTHERN PEATLANDS ARE ALSO DISCUSSED. THE MAGNITUDE OF CH4 FLUX VARIES CONSIDERABLY AMONG PEATLAND TYPES (BOGS AND FENS) AND MICROTOPOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS (HUMMOCKS AND HOLLOWS). SOME ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES INCLUDING FORESTRY, PEAT HARVESTING AND INDUSTRIAL EMISSION OF SULPHUR DIOXIDE CAN CAUSE A REDUCTION IN CH4 RELEASE FROM NORTHERN PEATLANDS.

IN ADDITION TO THE OXIDATION OF THE UNDERLYING MARINE SEDIMENTS, THE DESICCATION OF A MAJOR EPICONTINENTAL SEAWAY WOULD REMOVE A LARGE SOURCE OF MOISTURE FOR THE CONTINENTAL INTERIOR, RESULTING IN THE DESICCATION AND BACTERIAL OXIDATION OF ADJACENT TERRESTRIAL WETLANDS.

CONCLUSIONS 62 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 62 REFERENCES 62 SUMMARY MOSSES IN NORTHERN ECOSYSTEMS ARE UBIQUITOUS COMPONENTS OF PLANT COMMUNITIES, AND STRONGLY INFLUENCE NUTRIENT, CARBON AND WATER CYCLING. WE USE LITERATURE REVIEW, SYNTHESIS AND MODEL SIMULATIONS TO EXPLORE THE ROLE OF MOSSES IN ECOLOGICAL STABILITY AND RESILIENCE. MOSS COMMUNITY RESPONSES TO DISTURBANCE SHOWED ALL POSSIBLE RESPONSES (INCREASES, DECREASES, NO CHANGE) WITHIN MOST DISTURBANCE CATEGORIES. SIMULATIONS FROM TWO PROCESS-BASED MODELS SUGGEST THAT NORTHERN ECOSYSTEMS WOULD NEED TO EXPERIENCE EXTREME PERTURBATION BEFORE MOSSES WERE ELIMINATED. BUT SIMULATIONS WITH TWO OTHER MODELS SUGGEST THAT LOSS OF MOSS WILL REDUCE SOIL CARBON ACCUMULATION PRIMARILY BY INFLUENCING DECOMPOSITION RATES AND SOIL NITROGEN AVAILABILITY. IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT MOSSES NEED TO BE INCORPORATED INTO MODELS AS ONE OR MORE PLANT FUNCTIONAL TYPES, BUT MORE EMPIRICAL WORK IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE HOW TO BEST AGGREGATE SPECIES. WE HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL ISSUES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY EXPLORED IN MOSS COMMUNITIES, SUCH AS FUNCTIONAL REDUNDANCY AND SINGULARITY, RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN RESPONSE AND EFFECT TRAITS, AND PARAMETER VS CONCEPTUAL UNCERTAINTY IN MODELS. MOSSES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN SEVERAL ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES THAT PLAY OUT OVER CENTURIES PERMAFROST FORMATION AND THAW, PEAT ACCUMULATION, DEVELOPMENT OF MICROTOPOGRAPHY AND THERE IS A NEED FOR STUDIES THAT INCREASE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SLOW, LONG-TERM DYNAMICAL PROCESSES.;THE RESILIENCE AND FUNCTIONAL ROLE OF MOSS IN BOREAL AND ARCTIC ECOSYSTEMS;NEW PHYTOLOGIST;REVIEW;OCT;2012;10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04254.x;PLANT SCIENCES;WOS:000308090000006

WE PRESENT CO2, CH4 AND N2O FLUXES FROM NATURAL AND RELATIVELY UNMANAGED SOIL-PLANT ECOSYSTEMS (THE ECOSYSTEMS MINIMALLY DISTURBED BY DIRECT HUMAN OR HUMAN- INDUCED ACTIVITIES). ALL NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS ARE NET SINKS FOR CO2, ALTHOUGH TUNDRA AND WETLANDS (INCLUDING PEATLANDS) ARE LARGE SOURCES OF CH4, WHEREAS SIGNIFICANT N2O EMISSIONS OCCUR MAINLY FROM TROPICAL AND TEMPERATE FORESTS. MOST NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS DECREASE NET GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) FROM - 0.03 +/- 0.35 T CO2-EHA(-1) Y(-1) (TROPICAL FORESTS) TO - 0.90 +/- 0.42 T CO2-E HA(-1) Y(-1) (TEMPERATE FORESTS) AND - 1.18 +/- 0.44 T CO2-E HA(-1) Y(-1) (BOREAL FORESTS), MOSTLY AS CO2 SINKS IN PHYTOBIOMASS, MICROBIAL BIOMASS AND SOIL C. BUT NET GWP CONTRIBUTIONS FROM WETLANDS ARE VERY LARGE, WHICH IS PRIMARILY DUE TO CH4 EMISSIONS. ALTHOUGH THE TROPICAL FOREST SYSTEM PROVIDES A LARGE CARBON SINK, THE NEGLIGIBLE CAPACITY OF TROPICAL FORESTS TO REDUCE GWP IS ENTIRELY DUE TO N2O EMISSIONS, POSSIBLY FROM RAPID N MINERALISATION UNDER FAVOURABLE TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE CONDITIONS. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS REDUCE THE NET ATMOSPHERIC GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS BY 3.55 +/- 0.44 GTCO(2)-EY(-1) OR SIMILAR TO 0.5 PPM(V) CO2-E Y(-1), HENCE, THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE OF NATURAL AND RELATIVELY UNMANAGED ECOSYSTEMS IN SLOWING GLOBAL WARMING AND CLIMATE CHANGE. HOWEVER, THE IMPACT OF INCREASING N DEPOSITION ON NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD, AND FURTHER UNDERSTANDING IS REQUIRED REGARDING THE USE OF DRAINAGE AS A MANAGEMENT TOOL, TO REDUCE CH4 EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS AND TO INCREASE GHG SINK FROM THE RESTORATION OF DEGRADED LANDS, INCLUDING SALINE AND SODIC SOILS.

RETALLACK GJ, 1999, GEOL SOC AM BULL;RETALLACK GJ;THE PERMIAN-TRIASSIC BOUNDARY IN THE SYDNEY BASIN OF AUSTRALIA IS COINCIDENT WITH A PRONOUNCED DECREASE IN DELTA(13)C ISOTOPIC VALUES OF ORGANIC CARBON, THE LAST COALS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD FOR ALL OF THE EARLY TRIASSIC (CA. 6 M.Y.) TIME, AND EXTIRPATION OF THE GLOSSOPTERIS FLORA AT THE TOP OF THE ILLAWARRA AND NEWCASTLE COAL MEASURES. COAL-BEARING PALEOSOLS OF THE LATEST PERMIAN REPRESENT EXTENSIVE SWAMPLANDS OF THE SEASONALLY DECIDUOUS GLOSSOPTERIS NORA IN A HUMID COLD TEMPERATE LOWLAND SOUTHWEST OF AN ANDEAN-STYLE VOLCANIC ARC. STONE-ROLLS (LARGE RIBS OF FLOOR ROCK UP INTO THE COAL) WITHIN SOME OF THE UPPERMOST COALS OF THE PERMIAN COAL MEASURES CAN BE INTERPRETED AS STRING BOGS OF A KIND NOW FOUND IN COLD CLIMATES AT LATITUDES OF 68 DEGREES-70 DEGREES, WHICH IS COMPATIBLE WITH A PALEOMAGNETICALLY ESTIMATED PALEOLATITUDE OF 65 DEGREES-85 DEGREES S FOR THE SYDNEY BASIN. PALEOLATITUDE WAS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT FOR EARLIEST TRIASSIC TIME, BUT PALEOSOLS OF THAT AGE INCLUDE INCEPTISOLS AND ENTISOLS SHOWING SUBSTANTIAL CHEMICAL AND TEXTURAL WEATHERING, MORE LIKE SOILS NOW FORMING AT LATITUDES OF 40 DEGREES-58 DEGREES THAN THOSE WITHIN POLAR CIRCLES. THIS ANOMALOUS HIGH-LATITUDE WARMTH SET IN AT THE PERMIAN-TRIASSIC BOUNDARY. SEDIMENTATION RATES INCREASED AT THE BOUNDARY MARKED BY GEOCHEMICALLY UNUSUAL ACIDIFICATION OF CLAY AND A DRAMATIC CARBON ISOTOPIC EXCURSION. THESE CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTS AND ECOSYSTEMS CAN BE EXPLAINED BY SOIL EROSION FOLLOWING DEFORESTATION IMPLIED BY THE PLANT EXTINCTIONS AND ABUNDANT FUNGAL REMAINS AT THE PERMIAN-TRIASSIC BOUNDARY.

BUBIER JL, 2007, GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL;"BUBIER JL;MOORE TR;BLEDZKI LA";WE MEASURED NET ECOSYSTEM CO2 EXCHANGE (NEE), PLANT BIOMASS AND GROWTH, SPECIES COMPOSITION, PEAT MICROCLIMATE, AND LITTER DECOMPOSITION IN A FERTILIZATION EXPERIMENT AT MER BLEUE BOG, OTTAWA, ONTARIO. THE BOG IS LOCATED IN THE ZONE WITH THE HIGHEST ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN DEPOSITION FOR CANADA, ESTIMATED AT 0.8-1.2 G N M(-2) YR(-1) (WET DEPOSITION AS NH4 AND NO3). TO ESTABLISH THE EFFECT OF NUTRIENT ADDITION ON THIS ECOSYSTEM, WE FERTILIZED THE BOG WITH SIX TREATMENTS INVOLVING THE APPLICATION OF 1.6-6 G N M(-2) YR(-1) (AS NH4NO3), WITH AND WITHOUT P AND K, IN TRIPLICATE 3 M X 3 M PLOTS. THE INITIAL 5-6 YEARS HAVE SHOWN A LOSS OF FIRST SPHAGNUM, THEN POLYTRICHUM MOSSES, AND AN INCREASE IN VASCULAR PLANT BIOMASS AND LEAF AREA INDEX. ANALYSES OF NEE, MEASURED IN SITU WITH CLIMATE-CONTROLLED CHAMBERS, INDICATE THAT CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS, THE TREATMENTS WITH THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF NUTRIENT ADDITION SHOWED LOWER RATES OF MAXIMUM NEE AND GROSS PHOTOSYNTHESIS, BUT LITTLE CHANGE IN ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION AFTER 5 YEARS. ALTHOUGH SHRUB BIOMASS AND LEAF AREA INCREASED IN THE HIGH NUTRIENT PLOTS, LOSS OF MOSS PHOTOSYNTHESIS OWING TO NUTRIENT TOXICITY, INCREASED VASCULAR PLANT SHADING AND GREATER LITTER ACCUMULATION CONTRIBUTED TO THE LOWER LEVELS OF CO2 UPTAKE. OUR STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF LONG-TERM EXPERIMENTS AS WE DID NOT OBSERVE LOWER NEE UNTIL THE FIFTH YEAR OF THE EXPERIMENT. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE A TRANSIENT RESPONSE AS THE TREATMENT PLOTS CONTINUE TO CHANGE.

MOORE PD, 2002, ENVIRON CONSERV;MOORE PD;THE TEMPERATE PEATLANDS ARE EXTENSIVE, COVERING AROUND 3.5 MILLION KM(2) OF LAND. THEY CONTAIN ABOUT 455 GT OF CARBON, ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO THE CARBON STORED IN ALL OF THE LIVING THINGS ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET, AND REPRESENTING AROUND 25% OF ALL THE SOIL CARBON ON EARTH. THESE BOGS ARE A SINK FOR ATMOSPHERIC CARBON AND THEIR CARBON UPTAKE ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 12% OF CURRENT HUMAN EMISSIONS. THEY VARY CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR FORM AND STRUCTURE AND ARE AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, INCLUDING THE STUDY OF PAST ENVIRONMENTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THEY ARE ALSO VALUABLE IN ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION. THEY ARE LOW IN BIODIVERSITY, BUT THEIR FAUNA AND FLORA ARE DISTINCTIVE AND MANY GROUPS ARE CONFINED TO THIS HABITAT. FOR ALL THESE REASONS, THE FUTURE CONSERVATION OF PEATLANDS IS A MATTER FOR CONCERN. THREATS TO PEATLANDS COME FROM DIRECT HUMAN EXPLOITATION IN THE FORM OF PEAT HARVESTING FOR ENERGY AND HORTICULTURE, AND DRAINAGE FOR FORESTRY. RISING ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS SHOULD CONTROL BOTH OF THESE PROCESSES IN THE WESTERN WORLD, BUT CONTINUED NORTHERN PEATLAND LOSSES ARE LIKELY LOCALLY, ESPECIALLY IN ASIA. PEATLAND DRAINAGE FOR FORESTRY OR AGRICULTURE WILL RESULT IN LOSSES OF CARBON TO THE ATMOSPHERE, ADDING TO THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT. HUMAN POPULATION PRESSURES, INDUSTRIALIZATION AND URBANIZATION ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE INFLUENCE IN THE BOREAL ZONE. FRAGMENTATION OF THE HABITAT IS NOT AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION BECAUSE BOGS ARE BY THEIR VERY NATURE 'ISLAND' HABITATS. ACIDIFICATION BY AERIAL POLLUTION MAY BE A LOCAL PROBLEM CLOSE TO SOURCES, BUT THE HABITAT IS NATURALLY ACID AND SHOULD NOT BE SEVERELY AFFECTED, THE INPUT OF AERIAL NUTRIENTS, HOWEVER, PARTICULARLY NITROGEN, COULD HAVE WIDESPREAD IMPACT ON BOGS, ENHANCING THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND ALTERING THEIR VEGETATION COMPOSITION. THE PHYSICAL REHABILITATION OF BOGS DAMAGED BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES PRESENTS MANY PROBLEMS, PARTICULARLY RELATING TO THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF PEAT STRUCTURE AND VEGETATION, BUT THE PROCESS CAN RESULT IN THE RE-FORMATION OF A CARBON SINK SO IT IS WORTH THE EFFORT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN ITS IMPACT ON BOGS. HIGHER TEMPERATURE (ESPECIALLY IF ACCOMPANIED BY RAISED ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS AND INCREASED NITRATE DEPOSITION) WILL ENHANCE PRODUCTIVITY, BUT WILL ALSO RESULT IN FASTER DECOMPOSITION RATES. THE OUTCOME OF THESE OPPOSING FACTORS FOR PEAT FORMATION WILL ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON THE FUTURE PATTERN OF PRECIPITATION. IF, AS SEEMS MOST LIKELY, SUMMER CONDITIONS BECOME WARMER AND DRIER IN CONTINENTAL REGIONS AND WINTERS BECOME MILDER AND WETTER, THE SUMMER DROUGHT COULD CAUSE PEAT LOSS AND BOG CONTRACTION. AN EXCESS OF DECOMPOSITION WILL LEAD TO BOGS BECOMING A CARBON SOURCE AND THUS A POSITIVE FEEDBACK IN GLOBAL WARMING. EMISSIONS OF METHANE AND NITROUS OXIDE WOULD ADD TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS PROBLEM, BUT LIKELY OXIDATION OF METHANE AND LOW N(2)O PRODUCTION MAY WELL MEAN THAT THIS IMPACT WILL NOT PROVE TO BE SIGNIFICANT. TREE INVASION OF BOGS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUMMER DROUGHT COULD LOCALLY LEAD TO INCREASED WATER LOSS THROUGH TRANSPIRATION, AND HIGHER HEAT ABSORPTION THROUGH ALBEDO CHANGE. THIS WILL ENHANCE THE DRYING EFFECT ON THE BOG SURFACE. OCEANIC MIRES WILL BE LESS SEVERELY AFFECTED IF THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN PRECIPITATION TAKES PLACE IN THESE REGIONS.

ANDERSEN R, 2013, SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM;"ANDERSEN R;CHAPMAN SJ;ARTZ RRE";EVEN THOUGH LARGE EXTENTS OF BOREAL PEATLANDS ARE STILL IN A PRISTINE CONDITION, ESPECIALLY IN NORTH AMERICA, EXTENSIVE AREAS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY NATURAL OR ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES THAT CHANGE SOME OF THE SYSTEMS FROM BEING SINKS TO SOURCES OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND SHIFT THE METHANE PRODUCTION/CONSUMPTION PATTERNS THROUGH ALTERATIONS OF BOTH ABOVE- AND BELOW-GROUND COMMUNITIES AND FUNCTIONS. IN ORDER TO FULLY ASSESS THE ROLE OF PEATLANDS ON GLOBAL C BALANCE, NOW AND IN THE FUTURE, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE DEEPEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF VARIOUS GROUPS OF MICROORGANISMS TO ORGANIC MATTER TRANSFORMATIONS. HERE, WE REVIEW THE DRIVERS STRUCTURING FUNGAL, BACTERIAL AND ARCHAEAL COMMUNITIES IN NATURAL PEATLANDS AND THE RESPONSE OF THESE MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES TO NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES, INCLUDING FIRE, DRAINAGE, NUTRIENT DEPOSITION, PEAT MINING AND CLIMATE CHANGE. THE MICROBIAL DIVERSITY IN PEATLANDS IS CHARACTERIZED BY ORGANISMS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED PHYSIOLOGICAL AND METABOLIC ADAPTATIONS TO COPE WITH THE CONSTRAINING CONDITIONS FOUND IN THESE ECOSYSTEMS, SUCH AS LOW OXYGEN AVAILABILITY, COLD TEMPERATURE, ACIDITY AND OLIGOTROPHY. FURTHERMORE, THESE UNIQUE ORGANISMS SOMETIMES APPEAR TO BE ORGANIZED AS REPEAT MOSAICS RESPONDING TO VEGETATION, PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS MORE THAN TO GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE, IN OTHER WORDS, SIMILAR TO THE MUCH VALUED BIODIVERSITY ASPECTS OF THE PEATLAND VEGETATION ITSELF AND ASSOCIATED HIGHER ORGANISMS. THE RESPONSE OF MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES TO DISTURBANCES IS FAR FROM FULLY UNDERSTOOD. IN PARTICULAR, WHILST MANY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED CHANGES IN MICROBIAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OR ON MICROBIALLY DRIVEN PROCESSES FOLLOWING A GIVEN DISTURBANCE, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR HOW THE TWO COMPONENTS, DIVERSITY AND FUNCTION, RELATE WITH EACH OTHER. FUTURE CHALLENGES INVOLVE DESIGNING STUDIES THAT WILL TEST WHETHER ECOLOGICAL THEORIES LIKE SPECIES SORTING, STRESS PHYSIOLOGY, TEMPORAL NICHE OR FUNCTIONAL REDUNDANCY CAN BE USED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT REGULATES MICROBIAL POPULATIONS AND ACTIVITY IN PEATLANDS, AND STUDIES THAT WILL ALLOW US TO PREDICT MORE ACCURATELY HOW PEATLANDS RESPOND TO GLOBAL CHANGE OR ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES.

PESTER M, 2012, FRONT MICROBIOL;"PESTER M;KNORR KH;FRIEDRICH MW;WAGNER M;LOY A";FRESHWATER WETLANDS ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS METHANE BUT AT THE SAME TIME CAN FUNCTION AS CARBON SINK. THEIR RESPONSE TO GLOBAL WARMING AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION IS ONE OF THE LARGEST UNKNOWNS IN THE UPCOMING DECADES TO CENTURIES. IN THIS REVIEW, WE HIGHLIGHT THE ROLE OF SULFATE-REDUCING MICROORGANISMS (SRM) IN THE INTERTWINED ELEMENT CYCLES OF WETLANDS. ALTHOUGH REGARDED PRIMARILY AS METHANOGENIC ENVIRONMENTS, BIOGEOCHEMICAL STUDIES HAVE REVEALED A PREVIOUSLY HIDDEN SULFUR CYCLE IN WETLANDS THAT CAN SUSTAIN RAPID RENEWAL OF THE SMALL STANDING POOLS OF SULFATE. THUS, DISSIMILATORY SULFATE REDUCTION, WHICH FREQUENTLY OCCURS AT RATES COMPARABLE TO MARINE SURFACE SEDIMENTS, CAN CONTRIBUTE UP TO 36-50% TO ANAEROBIC CARBON MINERALIZATION IN THESE ECOSYSTEMS. SINCE SULFATE REDUCTION IS THERMODYNAMICALLY FAVORED RELATIVE TO FERMENTATIVE PROCESSES AND METHANOGENESIS, IT EFFECTIVELY DECREASES GROSS METHANE PRODUCTION THEREBY MITIGATING THE FLUX OF METHANE TO THE ATMOSPHERE. HOWEVER, VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT WETLAND SRM. MOLECULAR ANALYSES USING DSRAB [ENCODING SUBUNIT A AND B OF THE DISSIMILATORY (BI)SULFITE REDUCTASE] AS MARKER GENES DEMONSTRATED THAT MEMBERS OF NOVEL PHYLOGENETIC LINEAGES, WHICH ARE UNRELATED TO RECOGNIZED SRM, DOMINATE DSRAB RICHNESS AND, IF TESTED, ARE ALSO ABUNDANT AMONG THE DSRAB-CONTAINING WETLAND MICROBIOTA. THESE DISCOVERIES POINT TOWARD THE EXISTENCE OF SO FAR UNKNOWN SRM THAT ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE AUTOCHTHONOUS WETLAND MICROBIOTA. IN ADDITION TO THESE NUMERICALLY DOMINANT MICROORGANISMS, A RECENT STABLE ISOTOPE PROBING STUDY OF SRM IN A GERMAN PEATLAND INDICATED THAT RARE BIOSPHERE MEMBERS MIGHT BE HIGHLY ACTIVE IN SITU AND HAVE A CONSIDERABLE STAKE IN WETLAND SULFATE REDUCTION.

OSTLE NJ, 2009, LAND USE POLICY;"OSTLE NJ;LEVY PE;EVANS CD;SMITH P";THIS REVIEW EXPLORES THE ROLE OF LAND USE AND LAND USE CHANGE AS A DETERMINANT OF THE SOIL'S ABILITY TO SEQUESTER AND STORE CARBON IN THE UK. OVER 95 PERCENT OF THE UK LAND CARBON STOCK IS LOCATED IN SOILS WHICH ARE SUBJECTED TO A RANGE OF LAND USES AND GLOBAL CHANGES. LAND USE CHANGE CAN RESULT IN RAPID SOIL LOSS OF CARBON FROM PEATLANDS, GRASSLANDS, PLANTATION FOREST AND NATIVE WOODLAND. SOIL CARBON ACCUMULATES MORE SLOWLY (DECADAL) BUT GAINS CAN BE MADE WHEN CROPLANDS ARE CONVERTED TO GRASSLANDS, PLANTATION FOREST OF NATIVE WOODLAND. THE NEED FOR LAND FOR FOOD PRODUCTION AND RENEWABLE FORMS OF ENERGY COULD HAVE CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE ON UK SOIL CARBON STORAGE IN THE FUTURE. THERE IS A NEED TO RECOGNISE THE RISK OF SOIL CARBON LOSSES OCCURING WHEN LAND USE CHANGE TO INCREASE CARBON STORAGE IS OFFSET BY COMPENSATORY LAND USE CONVERSIONS ELSEWHERE THAT RESULT IN NET CARBON RELEASE. THE PROTECTION OF PEATLAND AND OTHER ORGANIC SOIL CARBON STOCKS, AND THE MANAGEMENT OF CROPLAND, GRASSLAND AND FOREST SOILS TO INCREASE CARBON SEQUESTRATION, WILL BE CRUCIAL TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE UK CARBON BALANCE. IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO DEVELOP POLICY TO BALANCE TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN SOIL CARBON GAINS WITH OTHER LAND USE PRIORITIES. THESE INCLUDE THE SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION OF FOOD, BIO-ENERGY AND FIBRE CROPS AND LIVESTOCK.

DUNTON KH, 2006, PROG OCEANOGR;"DUNTON KH;WEINGARTNER T;CARMACK EC";THE NEARSHORE SHELF OF THE BEAUFORT SEA IS DEFINED BY EXTREME PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL GRADIENTS THAT HAVE A DISTINCTIVE INFLUENCE ON ITS PRODUCTIVITY AND TROPHIC STRUCTURE. MASSIVE FRESHWATER DISCHARGE FROM THE MACKENZIE RIVER, ALONG WITH NUMEROUS SMALLER RIVERS AND STREAMS ELSEWHERE ALONG THE COAST, PRODUCE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS DECIDEDLY ESTUARINE IN CHARACTER, ESPECIALLY IN LATE SPRING AND SUMMER. CONSEQUENTLY, THE BEAUFORT COAST PROVIDES A CRITICAL HABITAT FOR SEVERAL SPECIES OF AMPHIDROMOUS FISHES, SOME OF WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE SUBSISTENCE LIFESTYLE OF ARCTIC NATIVE POPULATIONS. BECAUSE OF ITS LOW IN SITU PRODUCTIVITY, ALLOCHTHONOUS INPUTS OF ORGANIC CARBON, IDENTIFIABLE ON THE BASIS OF ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION, ARE IMPORTANT TO THE FUNCTIONING OF THIS ARCTIC ESTUARINE SYSTEM. COASTAL EROSION AND RIVER DISCHARGE ARE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR INTRODUCING HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF SUSPENDED SEDIMENT FROM UPLAND REGIONS INTO THE NEARSHORE ZONE. THE DEPLETION IN THE C-13 CONTENT OF INVERTEBRATE AND VERTEBRATE CONSUMERS, WHICH DROPS ABOUT 4-5 PARTS PER THOUSAND EASTWARD ALONG THE EASTERN ALASKAN BEAUFORT SEA COAST, MAY REFLECT THE ASSIMILATION OF THIS TERRESTRIAL ORGANIC MATTER INTO LOCAL FOOD WEBS. IN ADDITION, THE LARGE RANGE IN C-13 VALUES OF FAUNA COLLECTED IN THE EASTERN BEAUFORT (NEARLY 8 PARTS PER THOUSAND) COMPARED TO THE SAME SPECIES IN THE NORTHEASTERN CHUKCHI (3 PARTS PER THOUSAND), INDICATE A LOWER EFFICIENCY OF CARBON TRANSFER BETWEEN TROPHIC LEVELS IN THE EASTERN BEAUFORT. THE WIDER SPREAD IN STABLE ISOTOPE VALUES IN THE EASTERN BEAUFORT MAY ALSO REFLECT A DECOUPLING BETWEEN BENTHIC AND PELAGIC COMPONENTS. ISOTOPIC TRACER STUDIES OF AMPHIDROMOUS FISHES IN THE SIMPSON ISLAND BARRIER ISLAND LAGOON REVEALED THAT TERRESTRIAL (PEAT) CARBON MAY CONTRIBUTE AS MUCH AS 30-500% OF THEIR TOTAL DIETARY REQUIREMENTS. ON THE EASTERN ALASKA BEAUFORT SEA COAST, THE DELTA C-13 VALUES OF ARCTIC COD COLLECTED IN SEMI-ENCLOSED LAGOONS WERE MORE DEPLETED, BY 3-4 PARTS PER THOUSAND, COMPARED TO FISH COLLECTED IN THE COASTAL BEAUFORT SEA. CALCULATIONS FROM ISOTOPIC MIXING EQUATIONS INDICATE COD FROM LAGOONS MAY DERIVE 70% OF THEIR CARBON FROM TERRESTRIAL SOURCES. THE DELTA N-15 VALUES OF LAGOON FISH WERE ALSO 4 PARTS PER THOUSAND LOWER THAN COASTAL SPECIMENS, REFLECTIVE OF THE LOWER DELTA N-15 VALUES OF TERRESTRIALLY DERIVED NITROGEN (0-1.5 PARTS PER THOUSAND COMPARED TO 5-7 PARTS PER THOUSAND FOR PHYTOPLANKTON). THE ROLE OF TERRESTRIAL CARBON IN ARCTIC ESTUARINE FOOD WEBS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN VIEW OF THE CURRENT WARMING TREND IN THE ARCTIC ENVIRONMENT AND THE ROLE OF ADVECTIVE PROCESSES THAT TRANSPORT CARBON ALONG THE NEARSHORE SHELF.

EUROPEAN SOILS ARE A NET C SINK (114 TG YR-1), BUT CONSIDERING THE EMISSIONS OF GHGS, SOILS ARE A SOURCE OF ABOUT 26 TG CO2 C-EQUIVALENT YR-1. FOREST, GRASSLAND AND SEDIMENT C SINKS ARE OFFSET BY GHG EMISSIONS FROM CROPLANDS, PEATLANDS AND INLAND WATERS. NON-GHGS (NH3, NOX) INTERACT SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE GHG AND THE C CYCLE THROUGH AMMONIUM NITRATE AEROSOLS AND DRY DEPOSITION. WET DEPOSITION OF NITROGEN (N) SUPPORTS ABOUT 50% OF FOREST TIMBER GROWTH. LAND USE CHANGE IS REGIONALLY IMPORTANT. THE ABSOLUTE FLUX VALUES TOTAL ABOUT 50 TG C YR-1. NEVERTHELESS, FOR THE EUROPEAN TRACE-GAS BALANCE, LAND-USE INTENSITY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN LAND-USE CHANGE.

BALDOCCHI D, 2018, AGR FOREST METEOROL;"BALDOCCHI D;CHU HS;REICHSTEIN M";"AS THE LIFETIME OF REGIONAL FLUX NETWORKS APPROACH TWENTY YEARS, THERE IS A GROWING NUMBER OF PAPERS THAT HAVE PUBLISHED LONG TERM RECORDS (5 YEARS OR MORE) OF NET CARBON FLUXES BETWEEN ECOSYSTEMS AND THE ATMOSPHERE. UNANSWERED QUESTIONS FROM THIS BODY OF WORK ARE: 1) HOW VARIABLE ARE CARBON FLUXES ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS?; 2) WHAT ARE THE BIOPHYSICAL FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY AND/OR TEMPORAL TRENDS IN CARBON FLUXES?; AND 3) HOW DOES THE BIOPHYSICAL CONTROL ON THIS CARBON FLUX VARIABILITY DIFFER BY CLIMATE AND ECOLOGICAL SPACES? TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS, WE SURVEYED PUBLISHED DATA FROM 59 SITES THAT REPORTED ON FIVE OR MORE YEARS OF CONTINUOUS MEASUREMENTS, YIELDING 544 SITE-YEARS OF DATA. WE FOUND THAT THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF THE INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY IN NET ECOSYSTEM CARBON EXCHANGE (162 GC M(-2) Y(-1)) IS LARGE RELATIVE TO ITS POPULATION MEAN (-200 GC M(-2) Y(-1)). BROAD-LEAVED EVERGREEN FORESTS AND CROPS EXPERIENCED THE GREATEST ABSOLUTE VARIABILITY IN INTERANNUAL NET CARBON EXCHANGE (GREATER THAN 300 GC M(-2) Y(-1)) AND BOREAL EVERGREEN FORESTS AND MARITIME WETLANDS WERE AMONG THE LEAST VARIABLE (LESS THAN 40 GC M(-2) Y(-1)). A DISPROPORTIONATE FRACTION OF THE YEARLY VARIABILITY IN NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH BIOPHYSICAL FACTORS THAT MODULATED ECOSYSTEM PHOTOSYNTHESIS RATHER THAN ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION. YET, THERE WAS APPRECIABLE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT COVARIANCE BETWEEN ECOSYSTEM PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND RESPIRATION. CONSEQUENTLY, BIOPHYSICAL CONDITIONS THAT CONSPIRED TO INCREASE ECOSYSTEM PHOTOSYNTHESIS TO FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION, AND VICE VERSA; ON AVERAGE, THE YEAR TO YEAR CHANGE IN RESPIRATION WAS 40% AS LARGE AS THE YEAR TO YEAR CHANGE IN PHOTOSYNTHESIS. THE ANALYSIS ALSO IDENTIFIED SETS OF ECOSYSTEMS THAT ARE ON THE VERGE OF SWITCHING FROM BEING CARBON SINKS TO CARBON SOURCES. THESE INCLUDE SITES IN THE ARCTIC TUNDRA, THE EVERGREEN FORESTS IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST AND SOME GRASSLANDS, WHERE YEAR TO YEAR CHANGES IN RESPIRATION ARE OUTPACING THOSE IN PHOTOSYNTHESIS. WHILE A SELECT SET OF CLIMATIC AND ECOLOGICAL FACTORS (E.G. LIGHT, RAINFALL, TEMPERATURE, PHENOLOGY) PLAYED DIRECT AND INDIRECT ROLES ON THIS VARIABILITY, THEIR IMPACT DIFFERED CONDITIONALLY, AS WELL AS BY CLIMATE AND ECOLOGICAL SPACES. FOR EXAMPLE, RAINFALL HAD BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS. DEFICIENT RAINFALL CAUSED A PHYSIOLOGICAL DECLINE IN PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN TEMPERATE AND SEMI-ARID REGIONS. TOO MUCH RAIN, IN THE HUMID TROPICS, LIMITED PHOTOSYNTHESIS BY LIMITING LIGHT. IN PEATLANDS AND TUNDRA, EXCESS PRECIPITATION LIMITED ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION WHEN IT RAISED THE WATER TABLE TO THE SURFACE. FOR DECIDUOUS FORESTS, WARMER TEMPERATURES LENGTHENED THE GROWING SEASON, INCREASING PHOTOSYNTHESIS, BUT THIS EFFECT ALSO INCREASED SOIL RESPIRATION. FINALLY, STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO EVALUATE THE DETECTION LIMIT OF TRENDS; WE COMPUTED THE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS OF TRENDS IN MULTI-YEAR CARBON FLUXES THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED TO CONCLUDE WHETHER THE DIFFERENCES ARE TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO RANDOMNESS OR BIOPHYSICAL FORCINGS.

THEY APPEAR TO BE WIDESPREAD IN NATURE AND HAVE BEEN ISOLATED FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING SOILS, SEDIMENTS, FRESHWATER, MARINE SEDIMENTS, SEAWATER, ACID PEAL BOGS, HOT SPRINGS AND COLD ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS THE ANTARCTIC. THERE ARE NOW EIGHT RECOGNISED GENERA OF METHANOTROPHS. METHANOTROPHS HAVE ATTRACTED A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS SINCE THEY HAVE CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL FOR THE PRODUCTION OF BULK CHEMICALS, FINE CHEMICALS AND IN BIOREMEDIATION PROCESSES, SUCH AS THE DEGRADATION OF THE GROUNDWATER POLLUTANT TRICHLOROETHYLENE. MORE RECENTLY, THEY ARE BEING EXTENSIVELY STUDIED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF ENVIRONMENTS SINCE METHANOTROPHS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE GLOBAL METHANE CYCLE. POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION-BASED METHODS HAVE BEEN USED TO STUDY THE ECOLOGY AND DIVERSITY OF METHANOTROPHS. WE REVIEW HERE MOLECULAR ECOLOGY METHODS THAT ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE OR WHICH ARE CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED FOR METHANOTROPHS.

PEATLANDS AND VEGETATED COASTAL WETLANDS ARE AMONG THE MOST CARBON RICH SINKS ON THE PLANET SEQUESTERING APPROXIMATELY AS MUCH CARBON AS DO GLOBAL FOREST ECOSYSTEMS. ESTIMATES OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF RISING TEMPERATURE ON CURRENT WETLAND CARBON STORAGE AND FUTURE CARBON SEQUESTRATION POTENTIAL ARE SUMMARIZED. WE ALSO DEMONSTRATE THE NEED TO PREVENT DRYING OF WETLANDS AND THAWING OF PERMAFROST BY DISTURBANCES AND RISING TEMPERATURES TO PROTECT WETLAND CARBON STORES AND CLIMATE ADAPTATION/RESILIENCY ECOSYSTEM SERVICES.

THERE IS STILL MUCH UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW THE GHG DYNAMICS OF PEATLANDS ARE AFFECTED BY CLIMATE AND LAND USE CHANGE. CURRENT FIELD-BASED METHODS OF ESTIMATING ANNUAL CARBON EXCHANGE BETWEEN PEATLANDS AND THE ATMOSPHERE INCLUDE FLUX CHAMBERS AND EDDY COVARIANCE TOWERS. HOWEVER, REMOTE SENSING HAS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER THESE TRADITIONAL APPROACHES IN TERMS OF COST, SPATIAL COVERAGE AND ACCESSIBILITY TO REMOTE LOCATIONS. IN THIS PAPER, WE OUTLINE THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF USING REMOTE SENSING TO ESTIMATE ECOSYSTEM CARBON FLUXES AND EXPLAIN THE RANGE OF SATELLITE DATA AVAILABLE FOR SUCH ESTIMATIONS, CONSIDERING THE INDICES AND MODELS DEVELOPED TO MAKE USE OF THE DATA. PAST STUDIES, WHICH HAVE USED REMOTE SENSING DATA IN COMPARISON WITH GROUND-BASED CALCULATIONS OF CARBON FLUXES OVER NORTHERN PEATLAND LANDSCAPES, ARE DISCUSSED, AS WELL AS THE CHALLENGES OF WORKING WITH REMOTE SENSING ON PEATLANDS.

THE HISTORY OF METHANE MIXING RATIOS, RECONSTRUCTED FROM MEASUREMENTS OF AIR TRAPPED IN ICE-CORES IS DESCRIBED. THE METHANE RECORD NOW EXTENDS BACK TO 420 KYR AGO IN THE CASE OF THE VOSTOK ICE CORES FROM ANTARCTICA. THE TRENDS IN MIXING RATIOS AND IN DELTA(13)C VALUES ARE REPORTED FOR THE TWO HEMISPHERES.

METHODS: WE DEVELOPED A BOG ECOSYSTEM MODEL THAT INCLUDES VEGETATION, CARBON, NITROGEN AND WATER DYNAMICS. TWO GROUPS OF VASCULAR PLANT SPECIES AND THREE GROUPS OF SPHAGNUM SPECIES COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER FOR LIGHT AND NITROGEN. THE MODEL WAS TESTED BY COMPARING THE OUTCOME WITH LONG-TERM HISTORIC VEGETATION CHANGES IN PEAT CORES FROM DENMARK AND ENGLAND. A CLIMATE SCENARIO WAS USED TO ANALYSE THE FUTURE EFFECTS OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2, TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION. RESULTS: THE MAIN CHANGES IN THE SPECIES COMPOSITION SINCE 1766 WERE SIMULATED BY THE MODEL. SIMULATIONS FOR A FUTURE WARMER, AND SLIGHTLY WETTER, CLIMATE WITH DOUBLING CO2 CONCENTRATION SUGGEST THAT LITTLE WILL CHANGE IN SPECIES COMPOSITION, DUE TO THE CONTRASTING EFFECTS OF INCREASING TEMPERATURES ( FAVOURING VASCULAR PLANTS) AND CO2 ( FAVOURING SPHAGNUM). FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE SHOWED THAT SIMULATED CARBON SEQUESTRATION IS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO VASCULAR PLANT EXPANSION. MODEL RESULTS SHOW THAT INCREASING TEMPERATURES MAY STILL INCREASE CARBON ACCUMULATION AT COOL, LOW N DEPOSITION SITES, BUT DECREASE CARBON ACCUMULATION AT HIGH N DEPOSITION SITES. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, N-DEPOSITION AND ATMOSPHERIC CO2 ARE NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD, BUT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THESE COMPONENTS OF GLOBAL CHANGE EXIST. THESE INTERACTIONS ARE THE RESULT OF CHANGES IN VEGETATION COMPOSITION.

HERE WE PROVIDE A REALISTIC ASSESSMENT OF THE THEORY THAT THE BASAL REGIONS OF THE ICE SHEETS THAT FORMED OVER NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE DURING GLACIATIONS WERE HOST TO SIGNIFICANT POPULATIONS OF ANAEROBIC MICROORGANISMS, INCLUDING METHANOGENS, ABLE TO METABOLIZE ORGANIC CARBON SEQUESTERED DURING INTERGLACIALS AND OVERRIDDEN DURING QUATERNARY GLACIALS. IN DOING SO, WE REVIEW THE CURRENT EVIDENCE FOR SUBGLACIAL METHANE RELEASE DURING DEGLACIATION, ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF THE SUBGLACIAL RESERVOIR OF ORGANIC CARBON (SOC), AND ASSESS THE AMOUNT OF SOC AVAILABLE TO SUBGLACIAL MICROBES AND THE LIKELY PATHWAYS AND RATES OF CARBON TURNOVER. WE THEN DISCUSS THE FATE OF SUBGLACIAL METHANE AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ITS RELEASE ON ATMOSPHERIC METHANE CONCENTRATIONS. WE CALCULATE THAT THE SOC EQUATES TO 418-610 PG C AND INCLUDES CARBON FROM TERRESTRIAL SOILS/VEGETATION, PEATLANDS, LAKE, AND MARINE SEDIMENTS. THE SOC THAT IS POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE FOR MICROBIAL CONVERSION TO METHANE IS SMALLER THAN THIS ESTIMATE DUE TO (1) GLACIAL EROSION, (2) ACCUMULATION OF RECALCITRANT ORGANIC CARBON COMPOUNDS OVER TIME, (3) CONVERSION TO CARBON DIOXIDE BY AEROBIC/ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION, AND (4) INCOMPLETE CONVERSION OF LABILE ORGANIC MATTER TO METHANE. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE TOTAL SOC AVAILABLE FOR CONVERSION TO METHANE IS 63 PG C. OUR ESTIMATES OF METHANE PRODUCTION POTENTIALS SPAN A WIDE RANGE BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING SUBGLACIAL METABOLIC RATES. WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THERE IS A STRONG LIKELIHOOD THAT SUBGLACIAL MICROBES COULD CONVERT 63 PG OF SOC TO METHANE DURING A GLACIAL CYCLE. IF THIS WERE THE CASE, RELEASE OF THIS METHANE FROM THE ICE SHEET MARGINS DURING RETREAT WOULD NEED TO BE EPISODIC IN ORDER TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT ATMOSPHERIC METHANE CONCENTRATIONS. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT IT MAY WELL BE IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER SUBGLACIAL ENVIRONMENTS AS ACTIVE COMPONENTS OF THE EARTH'S CARBON CYCLE.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO COMPILE A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF FUNGI THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED FROM PEATLANDS AND TO SUMMARIZE THEIR GENERAL ROLES IN THESE ECOSYSTEMS.

DIFFERENCES IN THEIR RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND EFFECTS ON ECOSYSTEM CARBON CYCLING PROCESSES MAY THUS FEEDBACK TO THE ATMOSPHERIC CARBON BALANCE AND THE CLIMATE AT A GLOBAL SCALE. HIERARCHICAL SPECIES CLASSIFICATIONS BASED ON PLANT GROWTH FORMS ARE WIDELY USED IN COLD, NORTHERN BIOMES TO GENERALIZE AND PREDICT THESE DIFFERENCES. THIS REVIEW INVESTIGATES THE USEFULNESS OF BROAD (VASCULAR, NON-VASCULAR), INTERMEDIATE (WOODY, NON-WOODY) AND NARROW (EVERGREEN SHRUBS, DECIDUOUS SHRUBS, GRAMINOIDS, FORBS) PLANT GROWTH-FORM-BASED GROUPS IN THESE BIOMES FOR PREDICTING PLANT RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND EFFECTS ON THE MAIN PROCESSES OF THE FULL CARBON CYCLE BY LOOKING AT THE SIMILARITY OF SPECIES WITHIN GROWTH-FORM GROUPS AND THE CONSISTENCY OF DIFFERENCES AMONG GROUPS UNDER CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. 2. PRODUCTION RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE DIFFER BETWEEN BROAD GROWTH-FORM GROUPS, BUT THEIR OPPOSITE RESPONSES DO NOT IMPLY THAT THE RESPONSES OF NON-VASCULAR PLANTS ARE CONSISTENTLY NEGATIVE. WITHIN VASCULAR GROWTH FORMS, PRODUCTION RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE ARE NOT ALWAYS SIMILAR AMONG SPECIES UNDER IDENTICAL CONDITIONS, AND AVERAGE DIFFERENCES AMONG NARROW VASCULAR GROWTH FORMS ARE USUALLY SMALL. MOREOVER, DIFFERENCES IN PRODUCTION RESPONSES AMONG GROWTH FORMS STRONGLY DEPEND UPON THE DURATION OF THE STUDY, THE REGION AND THE ECOSYSTEM TYPE. 3. SPECIES WITHIN NARROW GROWTH FORMS SHOW A HIGH SIMILARITY FOR A RANGE OF LEAF LITTER CHEMISTRY VARIABLES AND DIFFERENCES AMONG NARROW GROWTH FORMS ARE OFTEN LARGE AND CONSISTENT. HOWEVER, DIFFERENCES IN LEAF LITTER DECOMPOSABILITY ARE LARGE BETWEEN BROAD GROWTH-FORM GROUPS, BUT SMALL AND ENVIRONMENT-DEPENDENT AMONG IMPORTANT NARROW VASCULAR GROWTH FORMS. LITTER FEEDBACK EFFECTS TO PLANT PRODUCTION VARY AMONG NARROW VASCULAR GROWTH FORMS, BUT THE DIFFERENCES STRONGLY DEPEND ON THE STUDY DURATION. DATA ON THE CLIMATE DEPENDENCE OF GROWTH-FORM DIFFERENCES REGARDING THIS ASPECT OF THE CARBON CYCLE ARE CURRENTLY LACKING. 4. SYNTHESIS: OVERALL, THE USEFULNESS OF GROWTH-FORM-BASED GROUPS CLEARLY DIFFERS BETWEEN CARBON CYCLING PROCESSES. DIFFERENT AGGREGATION LEVELS ARE THEREFORE NEEDED FOR DIFFERENT PROCESSES. FOR MOST PROCESSES THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE DIFFERENCES AMONG GROWTH FORMS DEPEND ON ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, WHICH HAMPERS THEIR USE FOR GENERALIZATIONS AND MODELLING.

WHITE JR, 2008, J GEOPHYS RES-BIOGEO;"WHITE JR;SHANNON RD;WELTZIN JF;PASTOR J;BRIDGHAM SD";BOREAL PEATLANDS CONTAIN A LARGE PORTION OF THE EARTH'S TERRESTRIAL ORGANIC CARBON AND MAY BE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO CHANGES IN CLIMATE. TEMPERATURES IN BOREAL REGIONS ARE PREDICTED TO INCREASE DURING THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY WHICH MAY ACCELERATE CHANGES IN SOIL MICROBIAL PROCESSES AND PLANT COMMUNITY DYNAMICS. IN PARTICULAR, CLIMATE-DRIVEN CHANGES IN PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION MIGHT AFFECT THE PATHWAYS AND RATES OF METHANOGENESIS, THE PLANT-MEDIATED EMISSION OF METHANE, AND THE SCAVENGING OF METHANE BY METHANOTROPHIC BACTERIA. CLIMATE CHANGE MAY ALSO AFFECT METHANE CYCLING THROUGH CHANGES IN PORE WATER CHEMISTRY. TO DATE, THESE FEEDBACKS HAVE NOT BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE CARBON CYCLING COMPONENTS OF CLIMATE MODELS. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF SOIL WARMING AND WATER TABLE MANIPULATIONS ON METHANE CYCLING IN A FIELD MESOCOSM EXPERIMENT IN NORTHERN MINNESOTA, USA. LARGE INTACT SOIL MONOLITHS REMOVED FROM A BOG AND FEN RECEIVED INFRARED WARMING TREATMENTS CROSSED WITH WATER TABLE TREATMENTS FOR 6 YEARS. IN YEARS 5 AND 6, CONCENTRATIONS, FLUXES, AND ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS OF METHANE WERE MEASURED ALONG WITH ABOVEGROUND AND BELOWGROUND NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY AND PORE WATER CONCENTRATIONS OF ACETATE, SULFATE, AMMONIUM, NITRATE, AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON. WATER TABLE LEVEL WAS THE DOMINANT CONTROL OVER METHANE FLUX IN THE FEN MESOCOSMS, LIKELY THROUGH ITS EFFECT ON METHANE OXIDATION RATES. HOWEVER, PORE WATER CHEMISTRY AND PLANT PRODUCTIVITY WERE IMPORTANT SECONDARY FACTORS IN EXPLAINING METHANE FLUX IN THE FEN MESOCOSMS, AND THESE FACTORS APPEARED TO BE THE PREDOMINANT CONTROLS OVER METHANE FLUX IN THE BOG MESOCOSMS. THE WATER TABLE AND IR TREATMENTS HAD LARGE EFFECTS ON PORE WATER CHEMISTRY AND PLANT PRODUCTIVITY, SO THE INDIRECT EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE APPEAR TO BE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF CHANGING TEMPERATURE AND WATER TABLE LEVEL IN CONTROLLING FUTURE METHANE FLUXES FROM NORTHERN PEATLANDS. PORE WATER SULFATE, AMMONIUM, NITRATE, AND ACETATE HAD A RELATIVELY CONSISTENT NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH METHANE EMISSIONS, PORE WATER DOC HAD A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH METHANE EMISSIONS, AND BNPP HAD MIXED EFFECTS. THE BOG MESOCOSMS HAD MUCH HIGHER METHANE EMISSIONS AND PORE WATER METHANE CONCENTRATIONS THAN THE FEN MESOCOSMS, DESPITE A MUCH LOWER AVERAGE WATER TABLE LEVEL AND PEAT THAT IS A POOR SUBSTRATE FOR METHANOGENESIS. WE SUGGEST THAT THE RELATIVELY HIGH METHANE FLUXES IN THE BOG MESOCOSMS CAN BE EXPLAINED THROUGH THEIR LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF INHIBITORY PORE WATER COMPOUNDS, HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF DOC, AND HIGH PLANT PRODUCTIVITY. STABLE ISOTOPIC DATA FROM PORE WATER SUPPORT ACETATE FERMENTATION AS THE PRINCIPAL PATHWAY OF METHANOGENESIS IN BOG MESOCOSMS (MEAN DELTA(13) CH4 = -41.0%, MEAN DELTA D-CH4 = -190%). FEN MESOCOSMS HAD LOWER PORE WATER CONCENTRATIONS AND EMISSIONS OF METHANE THAN BOG MESOCOSMS, DESPITE MUCH HIGHER METHANE PRODUCTION POTENTIALS IN FEN PEAT. THE METHANE FROM THE FEN MESOCOSMS WAS ISOTOPICALLY HEAVY (MEAN DELTA(CH4)-C-13 = -28.9%, MEAN DELTA D-CH4 = -140%), SUGGESTING A STRONG OXIDATIVE SINK. THIS IS LIKELY RELATED TO THE DOMINANCE OF GRAMINOID VEGETATION AND THE ASSOCIATED OXYGEN TRANSPORT INTO THE RHIZOSPHERE.

HE XL, 2016, PERSPECT PLANT ECOL;"HE XL;HE KS;HYVONEN J";"UNDERSTANDING HOW PLANT SPECIES RESPOND TO CLIMATE CHANGE IS ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES IN BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABLE ECOSYSTEM PLANNING. CURRENT STUDIES OF THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON PLANTS ARE BIASED TO TRACHEOPHYTES, I.E. VASCULAR-PLANTS. ONLY A FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT ON BRYOPHYTES DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ECOLOGICALLY EQUALLY IMPORTANT GROUPS OF EMBRYOPHYTES WITH THEIR ORIGINS PREDATING CONTEMPORARY VASCULAR-PLANTS. BRYOPHYTES FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFER FROM VASCULAR PLANTS IN THEIR SMALL SIZE AND UTILIZATION OF A POIKILOHYDRIC STRATEGY FOR WATER AND NUTRIENTS; THEIR SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THEIR EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. THUS, THE RESULTS FROM STUDIES OF TRACHEOPHYTES CANNOT BE GENERALIZED ON BRYOPHYTES. IN THIS REVIEW, WE SYNTHESIZE INFORMATION ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ON BRYOPHYTES TO UNDERSTAND THEIR RELATION TO CLIMATE, ESPECIALLY TO TEMPERATURE ON A GLOBAL SCALE. WE DISCUSS A RANGE OF CRITICAL TOPICS, INCLUDING THE RESPONSES OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACTIVITIES TO TEMPERATURE CHANGES, AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPERATURE CHANGE ON THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN BRYOPHYTES AND VASCULAR-PLANTS, AS WELL AS ON PEATLAND ECOSYSTEMS. AS MANY SPECIES THRIVE IN RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURES, WITH A LOW POTENTIAL FOR SHORT-TERM THERMAL ACCLIMATION TO HIGHER TEMPERATURE IN A HYDRATED STATE, ELEVATED TEMPERATURES MAY SHORTEN THE TIME OF METABOLIC ACTIVITY, AND INCREASE DESICCATION INTENSITY. THIS CAN BRING SIGNIFICANT PHYSIOLOGICAL PRESSURE ON THE SURVIVAL OF POIKILOHYDRIC BRYOPHYTES. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF GLOBAL WARMING, SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN BRYOPHYTE DIVERSITY CAN BE EXPECTED, PARTICULARLY IN AREAS HARBOURING LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIES SUCH AS BOREAL FORESTS OF HIGHER LATITUDES, ALPINE BIOMES AND HIGHER ALTITUDES ON TROPICAL MOUNTAINS. FURTHERMORE, THE DECLINE OF BRYOPHYTE DIVERSITY WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO AN ALTERATION OF ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION, NUTRIENT CYCLING, AND CARBON BALANCE. FURTHER EXPLORATION OF BRYOPHYTE ECOPHYSIOLOGY IN THE CHANGING ENVIRONMENT, PARTICULARLY THE ACCLIMATION POTENTIAL OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND ITS BIOCHEMICAL AND ENZYME LEVEL BASIS TO PREDICTED CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE WILL PROVIDE NEW KNOWLEDGE THAT WILL ASSIST BRYOPHYTE CONSERVATION.

WHETHER PEATLANDS ACT AS SINKS OR SOURCES OF ATMOSPHERIC CARBON THUS RELIES ON VARIABLY SATURATED FLOW PROCESSES. THE RICHARDS EQUATION IS THE STANDARD MODEL FOR WATER FLOW IN SOILS, BUT IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER IT CAN BE APPLIED TO SIMULATE WATER FLOW IN LIVE SPHAGNUM MOSS. TRANSIENT LABORATORY EVAPORATION EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED TO OBSERVE EVAPORATIVE WATER FLUXES IN THE ACROTELM, CONTAINING LIVING SPHAGNUM MOSS, AND A DEEPER LAYER CONTAINING DECOMPOSED MOSS PEAT. THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA WERE EVALUATED BY INVERSE MODELING USING THE RICHARDS EQUATION AS PROCESS MODEL FOR VARIABLY-SATURATED FLOW. IT WAS TESTED WHETHER WATER FLUXES AND TIME SERIES OF MEASURED PRESSURE HEADS DURING EVAPORATION COULD BE SIMULATED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE MEASUREMENTS COULD BE MATCHED VERY WELL PROVIDING THE HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES ARE REPRESENTED BY A SUITABLE MODEL. FOR THIS, A TRIMODAL PARAMETRIZATION OF THE UNDERLYING PORE-SIZE DISTRIBUTION WAS NECESSARY WHICH REFLECTS THREE DISTINCT PORE SYSTEMS OF THE SPHAGNUM CONSTITUTED BY INTER-, INTRA-, AND INNER-PLANT WATER.

CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EFFLUXES, AN EFFLUX WHICH IN MOST ECOSYSTEMS IS A RESULT OF BOTH AUTOTROPHIC AND HETEROTROPHIC RESPIRATION, IN PARTICULAR HAVE RECEIVED INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION. THE IMPORTANCE OF BOTH CO2 AND METHANE (CH4) FLUXES ARE EMPHASISED IN THE ARCTIC BECAUSE OF THE LARGE AMOUNT OF SOIL ORGANIC CARBON STORED IN TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS AND CHANGES IN UPTAKE AND RELEASE DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGES. THIS CHAPTER FOCUSES ON CONTROLS ON SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL TRENDS IN SUBSURFACE CO2 AND CH4 PRODUCTION AS WELL AS ON TRANSPORT AND RELEASE OF GASES FROM THE SOIL OBSERVED IN THE VALLEY ZACKENBERGDALEN. A DOMINANCE OF NEAR-SURFACE TEMPERATURES CONTROLLING BOTH SPATIAL AND SEASONAL TRENDS IS SHOWN BASED ON DATA OBTAINED USING CLOSED CHAMBER AND EDDY-CORRELATION TECHNIQUES AS WELL AS IN MANIPULATED FIELD PLOTS AND IN CONTROLLED INCUBATION EXPERIMENTS. DESPITE VARIABLE TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITIES REPORTED, MOST DATA CAN BE FAIRLY WELL FITTED TO EXPONENTIAL TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT EQUATIONS. THE WATER CONTENT (AT WET SITES LINKED TO THE DEPTH TO THE WATER TABLE) IS A SECOND MAJOR FACTOR REGULATING SOIL RESPIRATION PROCESSES, BUT THE EFFECT IS QUITE DIFFERENT IN CONTRASTING VEGETATION TYPES. DRY HEATH SITES ARE SHOWN TO BE PERIODICALLY WATER LIMITED DURING THE GROWING SEASON AND RESPOND THEREFORE WITH HIGH RESPIRATION RATES WHEN WATERED. IN CONTRAST, WATER SATURATED CONDITIONS DURING MOST OF THE GROWING SEASON IN THE FEN AREAS HINDER THE AVAILABILITY OF OXYGEN, RESULTING IN BOTH CO2 AND CH4 PRODUCTION. THUS, WATER TABLE DRAWDOWN RESULTS IN DECREASING CH4 EFFLUXES BUT INCREASING CO2 EFFLUXES. ADDITIONAL CONTROLS ON GAS PRODUCTION ARE SHOWN TO BE RELATED TO THE AVAILABILITY OF SUBSTRATE AND PLANT PRODUCTIVITY. SUBSURFACE GAS PRODUCTION WILL PRODUCE PARTIAL AND TOTAL PRESSURE GRADIENT CAUSING GAS TRANSPORT, WHICH IN WELL-DRAINED SOILS IS MAINLY CONTROLLED BY DIFFUSION, WHEREAS GAS ADVECTION, BUBBLES AND TRANSPORT THROUGH ROOTS AND STEMS MAY BE IMPORTANT IN MORE SATURATED SOILS. BURSTS OF CO2 GAS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED DURING SPRING THAW AND CONFIRMED IN CONTROLLED SOIL THAWING EXPERIMENTS. FIELD OBSERVATIONS AS WELL AS EXPERIMENTAL WORK SUGGEST THAT SUCH BURSTS REPRESENT PARTLY ON-GOING SOIL RESPIRATION AND A PHYSICAL RELEASE OF GAS PRODUCED DURING THE WINTER. THE IMPORTANCE OF WINTER SOIL RESPIRATION IS EMPHASISED BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MICROBIAL RESPIRATION IN ZACKENBERG SAMPLES IS NOTED DOWN TO A LEAST -18 DEGREES C. HENCE, THE IMPORTANCE OF WINTER RESPIRATION AND BURST EVENTS IN RELATION TO SEASONAL AND FUTURE CLIMATE TRENDS REQUIRES MORE THAN JUST SUMMER MEASUREMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE AUTUMN PERIOD SEEMS IMPORTANT AS SNOWFALL PRIOR TO LOW AIR TEMPERATURE MAY INSULATE THE SOIL, KEEPING SOIL TEMPERATURES HIGH. THIS WILL EXTEND THE PERIOD OF HIGH SOIL RESPIRATION RATES AND THEREBY INCREASE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WINTER PERIOD FOR THE ANNUAL CARBON BALANCE. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTROLLING SUBSURFACE GAS PRODUCTION, WE CONCLUDE THAT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE LANDSCAPE WILL RESPOND QUITE DIFFERENTLY TO THE SAME CLIMATE CHANGES AS WELL AS THAT SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ARE LIKELY TO BE DIFFERENT FROM LONG-TERM EFFECTS.;HIGH-ARCTIC SOIL CO2 AND CH4 PRODUCTION CONTROLLED BY TEMPERATURE, WATER, FREEZING AND SNOW;ADVANCES IN ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH, VOL 40: HIGH-ARCTIC ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS IN A CHANGING CLIMATE;REVIEW;NA;2008;10.1016/S0065-2504(07)00019-0;ECOLOGY;WOS:000256528000019

THE LOWERED WT SITE HAD GREATER PEAT AERATION AND LARGER SEASONAL VERTICAL WT FLUCTUATIONS THAT LIKELY ELEVATED PEAT DECOMPOSITION AND SUBSIDENCE WITH SUBSEQUENT INCREASES IN BULK DENSITY, VERTICAL HYDRAULIC GRADIENT, DECREASED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY (K-SAT), AND A GREATER PORE WATER RESIDENCE TIME RELATIVE TO THE UNALTERED SITE.

PRISTINE PEATLANDS ARE STILL SEQUESTERING CARBON AT A RATE OF 0.096 PG CARBON PER YEAR; HOWEVER, ANTHROPOGENIC DEGRADATION OF PEATLANDS THROUGH DRAINING, FIRES AND EXPLOITATION CAN INCREASE THE PRODUCTION OF GHGS, SWITCHING PEATLANDS FROM NET SINKS TO NET SOURCES OF CARBON. CONSERVATION OF PEATLANDS THROUGHOUT THE UK AND THE REST OF THE WORLD IS CLEARLY ESSENTIAL FOR LIMITING GHG EMISSIONS AND IT IS THEREFORE SURPRISING THAT ACCOUNTING FOR EMISSIONS FROM PEATLANDS DOES NOT FEATURE PROMINENTLY IN THE UNFCCC'S KYOTO PROTOCOL.

HERE, WE REVIEW THE EXISTING MID- TO LATE HOLOCENE PEATLAND TREE-RING CHRONOLOGIES THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO STUDY CLIMATE VARIABILITY ON (SUB-)ANNUAL TO CENTENNIAL SCALES WITH A PRIMARY FOCUS ON NORTHERN EUROPE. SINCE THE 1970S, ABSOLUTELY DATED TREE-RING CHRONOLOGIES COVERING SUBSTANTIAL PARTS OF THE HOLOCENE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FROM EXCAVATED REMAINS OF OAK (QUERCUS SPP.) AND PINE (PINUS SYLVESTRIS L). THE ANNUAL TREE-RING PATTERNS OF THESE TREES ARE OFTEN CHARACTERIZED BY PERIODS OF DEPRESSED GROWTH REFLECTING ANNUAL TO DECADAL HYDROCLIMATIC CHANGES. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN THE SPATIO-TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF TREES THROUGHOUT THE HOLOCENE ARE OFTEN FOUND TO REFLECT DECADAL TO CENTENNIAL CLIMATE AND HYDROLOGICAL CHANGES. MOREOVER, SYNCHRONICITY BETWEEN TREE-RING CHRONOLOGIES AND TREE-POPULATION DYNAMICS OVER LARGER GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS SHOW PERIODS OF COHERENT REGIONAL CLIMATE FORCING, ESPECIALLY DURING THE MID-HOLOCENE. THIS REVIEW (I) PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF PIONEERING AND RECENT STUDIES PRESENTING TREE-RING CHRONOLOGIES DEVELOPED FROM SUBFOSSIL PEATLAND TREES, AND (II) PRESENTS RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FIELDS OF DENDROECOLOGY (I.E. THE RESPONSE OF TREE GROWTH AND CHANGES IN VITALITY AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN CLIMATIC VARIABLES) AND DENDROCLIMATOLOGY (I.E.

THE MIRE IS LOCATED IN AN AREA INTENSIVELY MINED FOR GOLD DURING THE ROMAN PERIOD, AND CLOSE TO A WATER-CANALIZATION SYSTEM USED FOR MINING OPERATIONS AT THAT TIME. OUR AIM WAS TO GET INSIGHTS INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WETLAND BY COMBINING PALYNOLOGICAL RECORDS OF HYDRO-HYGROPHYTES, NON-POLLEN PALYNOMORPHS AND GEOCHEMICAL ANALYSES, SUPPORTED BY C-14 DATINGS AND MULTIVARIATE STATISTICS. THE RESULTS INDICATE A COMPLEX PATTERN OF ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION. DURING THE LOCAL IRON AGE THE WETLAND WAS MINEROTROPHIC. SINCE SIMILAR TO 20 AD IT WAS SUBJECTED TO DRAMATIC HYDROLOGICAL CHANGES DUE TO A RISE OF THE WATER-TABLE, FLUCTUATING BETWEEN THE PRESENCE OF OPEN WATER AND PHASES OF DRAWDOWN. FINALLY, BY SIMILAR TO 745 AD, THE WETLAND EXPERIENCED A RAPID EVOLUTION TOWARDS OMBROTROPHIC CONDITIONS. HIGH GRAZING PRESSURE WAS DETECTED FOR THE LAST DECADES. THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE OCCURRED DURING EARLY ROMAN EMPIRE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE DIRECT USE OF THE WETLAND AS A WATER-RESERVOIR OF THE CANALISATION SYSTEM USED FOR GOLD-MINING. THUS, THE CURRENT NATURE OF THE MIRE MAY BE THE RESULT OF HUMAN IMPACT, ALTHOUGH MULTIPLE HUMAN- AND CLIMATE-INDUCED CAUSES WERE POTENTIALLY LINKED TO THE DETECTED SHIFTS. HOWEVER, THE SYSTEM SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN RESILIENT, SUCCESSFULLY BUFFERING THE CHANGES WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL ALTERATIONS OF ITS FUNCTIONING.

FRANZEN LG, 2007, GEOGR ANN A;"FRANZEN LG;CROPP RA";CARBON SEQUESTERING IN PEATLANDS IS BELIEVED TO BE A MAJOR CLIMATE-REGULATING MECHANISM THROUGHOUT THE LATE PHANEROZOIC. SINCE PLANT LIFE FIRST EVOLVED ON LAND, PEATLANDS HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT CARBON SINKS, WHICH COULD EXPLAIN SIGNIFICANT PARTS OF THE LARGE VARIATIONS IN ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE OBSERVED IN VARIOUS RECORDS. THE RESULT IS PEAT IN DIFFERENT DEGREES OF METAMORPHOSIS, I.E. LIGNITE, HARD COAL AND GRAPHITE. DURING PHASES OF EXTENSIVE GLACIATIONS SUCH AS THE 330240 MA PANGEA ICE AGE, ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE WAS CRITICALLY LOW. THIS PATTERN REPEATS ITSELF DURING THE PLEISTOCENE WHEN CARBON DIOXIDE OSCILLATES WITH AN AMPLITUDE OF C. 200-300 PPMV. THIS PAPER SUGGESTS THAT THE ICE AGE CYCLES DURING THE PLEISTOCENE ARE GENERATED BY THE INTERGLACIAL GROWTH OF PEATLANDS AND THE SUBSEQUENT SEQUESTERING OF CARBON INTO THIS TERRESTRIAL POOL. THE FINAL INITIATION OF ICE AGE PULSES TOWARDS THE END OF INTERGLACIALS, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE CYCLIC INFLUX OF COSMIC DUST TO THE EARTH SURFACE, WHICH IN TURN REGULATES CLOUD FORMATION AND THE IN COMING SHORTWAVE RADIATION. THESE SHORTER CYCLES HAVE A FREQUENCY OF C. 1000-1250 YEARS AND MIGHT BE CONNECTED TO SUNSPOT OR OTHER LOW FREQUENCY SOLAR VARIATIONS. IN A WIDER CONTEXT THE ICE AGE CYCLING COULD BE REGARDED AS AN INTERPLAY BETWEEN TERRESTRIAL LIFE ON THE HIGH LATITUDES OF THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE AND THE MARINE SUBSURFACE LIFE IN THE SOUTHEAST.

THEY HAVE ALSO GREAT BIOLOGICAL, HISTORICAL AND PALCOECOLOGICAL VALUES. THESE FEATURES LED TO A LARGE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH AND PUBLICATIONS, ESPECIALLY CONCEPTUAL AND NUMERICAL MODELS IN VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC FIELDS. DRAWING ON THIS LITERATURE, WE PROPOSE AN INTEGRATED CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF BOG FUNCTIONING. THE MODEL IS BUILT ON 8 BASIC ASSUMPTIONS ACTING AT TWO SCALES: THE ECOSYSTEM AS A WHOLE, THE BOG OR MESOTOPE AND THE MICROFORMS, THE ELEMENTARY SYSTEMIC UNITS. FIVE KINDS OF ECOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS DRIVING THE ECOSYSTEM ARE DEFINED TOO. BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS, THE CONSTRAINTS AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DATA, THRESHOLDS AND POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FEEDBACKS ARE ELUCIDATED. THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACKS CONTROLLING THE DEVELOPMENT AND HOMEOSTASIS OF THE ECOSYSTEM ARE RELATED TO THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE VEGETATION WHICH BUILDS THE PEAT BODY, THE SHAPE OF THE LATER AND THE WATER FLUXES PASSING THROUGH IT. THE POSITIVE FEEDBACK ALLOWING THE ESTABLISHMENT AND THE PERSISTENCE OF THE ECOSYSTEM IS RELATED TO PEAT MOSS ENGINEERING. FOUR POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOPS CAN STOP THE PEAT PRODUCTION, AND LEAD TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BOG. TWO LOOPS ARE BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES INVOLVING TREES AND BLUE MOOR GRASS (MOLINIA CAERULEA) WHICH SPREAD ONTO THE BOG. THE TWO OTHER LOOPS ARE RELATED TO SOIL AND SHAPE DISTURBANCE AND CHANGES IN PRODUCTION AND DEGRADATION OF THE ORGANIC MATTER. THE MODEL IS ESPECIALLY DESIGNED TO HELP ECOLOGICAL MONITORING AND HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF AN ECOLOGICAL DIAGNOSTIC INTEGRATING PLANTS, SOIL AND WATER FLUXES.

MULLER FLL, 2018, FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ;MULLER FLL;THERE IS A WIDELY RECOGNIZED LINK BETWEEN IRON BIOAVAILABILITY AND PHYTOPLANKTON GROWTH IN LARGE TRACTS OF THE WORLD OCEAN. IRON BIOAVAILABILITY IS THUS PIVOTAL TO THE REMOVAL OF ATMOSPHERIC CARBON VIA THE OCEAN'S 'BIOLOGICAL PUMP.' TO EVALUATE FUTURE SCENARIOS OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE, WE MUST THEREFORE UNDERSTAND BETTER HOW THE BIOAVAILABILITY OF IRON IN SEAWATER IS LINKED TO PROCESSES CONTROLLING ITS SUPPLY, CHEMICAL SPECIATION AND REMOVAL FROM THE WATER COLUMN. MUCH OF THE RESEARCH ON IRON INPUTS TO THE OPEN OCEAN HAS FOCUSED ON ATMOSPHERIC, BENTHIC (SHELF SEDIMENTS) AND HYDROTHERMAL (MIDOCEAN) SOURCES OF IRON. THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HAS BEEN THAT RIVERINE IRON SOURCES ARE NEGLIGIBLE BECAUSE MANY OF THE MAJOR WORLD RIVERS EXHIBIT EXTENSIVE REMOVAL OF DISSOLVED IRON BY FLOCCULATION PROCESSES DURING ESTUARINE MIXING. HOWEVER, RECENT STUDIES HAVE REVEALED THAT A FRACTION OF IRON ASSOCIATED WITH PEATLAND-DERIVED HUMIC AND FULVIC ACIDS MAY SURVIVE AGGREGATION PROCESSES IN THE FRESHWATER-SEAWATER MIXING ZONE, AND THUS BE EXPORTED OFFSHORE. THIS REVIEW IS A SYNTHESIS OF AVAILABLE DATA AND INFORMATION FOR AND AGAINST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT LAND-DERIVED HUMIC SUBSTANCES EXERT A SIGNIFICANT CONTROL ON THE MARINE BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLE OF IRON. FROM THE OUTSET, IT IS SHOWN THAT THIS HYPOTHESIS CAN NEITHER BE VERIFIED NOR DISPROVED AT PRESENT, IN PART DUE TO ANALYTICAL DIFFICULTIES IN CHARACTERIZING THE ALL-IMPORTANT MARINE COLLOIDAL PHASE. EVIDENCE IS THEN PRESENTED ON THE LIKELY CHEMICAL NATURE AND STRUCTURE OF IRON-BINDING HUMIC LIGANDS ALONG WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR THE LATERAL TRANSPORT OF IRON IN SURFACE WATERS AND ITS PARTICIPATION IN CARBON STABILIZATION IN MARINE SEDIMENTS.

THIS REVIEW EXAMINES LITERATURE RELATED TO THE EFFECTS OF WATER LEVEL ALTERATION ON C CYCLING IN PEATLANDS TO SUMMARIZE NEW IDEAS AND UNCERTAINTIES EMERGING IN THIS FIELD. PEATLAND ECOSYSTEMS MAINTAIN THEIR FUNCTION BY ALTERING PLANT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE TO ADAPT TO CHANGING WATER LEVELS. REGARDING PRIMARY PRODUCTION, WOODY PLANTS ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE IN UNFLOODED, WELL-AERATED CONDITIONS, WHILESPHAGNUMMOSSES ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE IN WETTER CONDITIONS. THE RESPONSES OF SEDGES TO WATER LEVEL ALTERATION ARE SPECIES-SPECIFIC. WHILE PEAT DECOMPOSITION IS FASTER IN UNFLOODED, WELL AERATED CONDITIONS, INCREASED PLANT PRODUCTION MAY COUNTERACT THE C LOSS INDUCED BY INCREASED ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION (ER) FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. IN CONTRAST, RISING WATER TABLE MAINTAINS ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS AND ENHANCES THE ROLE OF THE PEATLAND AS A C SINK.

ALTERED HYDROLOGY AND RISING TEMPERATURE CAN CHANGE THE BIOGEOCHEMISTRY AND FUNCTION OF A WETLAND TO THE DEGREE THAT SOME IMPORTANT SERVICES MIGHT BE TURNED INTO DISSERVICES. THIS MEANS THAT THEY WILL, FOR EXAMPLE, NO LONGER PROVIDE A WATER PURIFICATION SERVICE AND ADVERSELY THEY MAY START TO DECOMPOSE AND RELEASE NUTRIENTS TO THE SURFACE WATER. MOREOVER, A HIGHER RATE OF DECOMPOSITION THAN PRIMARY PRODUCTION (PHOTOSYNTHESIS) MAY LEAD TO A SHIFT OF THEIR FUNCTION FROM BEING A SINK OF CARBON TO A SOURCE. THIS REVIEW PAPER ASSESSES THE POTENTIAL RESPONSE OF NATURAL WETLANDS (PEATLANDS) AND CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN TERMS OF GAS EMISSION AND NUTRIENTS RELEASE. IN ADDITION, THE IMPACT OF KEY CLIMATIC FACTORS SUCH AS TEMPERATURE AND WATER AVAILABILITY ON WETLANDS HAS BEEN REVIEWED. THE AUTHORS IDENTIFIED THE METHODOLOGICAL GAPS AND WEAKNESSES IN THE LITERATURE AND THEN INTRODUCED A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR CONDUCTING A COMPREHENSIVE MESOCOSM EXPERIMENT TO ADDRESS THE EXISTING GAPS IN LITERATURE TO SUPPORT FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH ON WETLAND ECOSYSTEMS. IN THE FUTURE, HIGHER TEMPERATURES RESULTING IN DROUGHT MIGHT SHIFT THE ROLE OF BOTH CONSTRUCTED WETLAND AND PEATLAND FROM A SINK TO A SOURCE OF CARBON. HOWEVER, HIGHER TEMPERATURES ACCOMPANIED BY MORE PRECIPITATION CAN PROMOTE PHOTOSYNTHESIS TO A DEGREE THAT MIGHT EXCEED THE RESPIRATION AND MAINTAIN THE CARBON SINK ROLE OF THE WETLAND. THERE MIGHT BE A CRITICAL WATER LEVEL AT WHICH THE WETLAND CAN PRESERVE MOST OF ITS SERVICES. IN ORDER TO FIND THAT LEVEL, A STUDY OF THE KEY FACTORS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THEIR INTERACTIONS USING AN APPROPRIATE EXPERIMENTAL METHOD IS NECESSARY. SOME CONTRADICTORY RESULTS OF PAST EXPERIMENTS CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES, DESIGNS, TIME PERIODS, CLIMATES, AND NATURAL VARIABILITY.

THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF A BIOCHAR AFFECT ITS CAPACITY: TO REDUCE THE EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES; TO IMPROVE THE GROWTH OF HOTHOUSE PLANTS; TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE USE OF MANURES AND WATER; AND TO MODIFY THE STRUCTURE AND THE DIVERSITY OF THE BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES IN A HORTICULTURAL SUBSTRATE AND A MINERAL SOIL. THESE BIOCHARS WERE PRODUCED UNDER VARIOUS CONDITIONS. THE ANALYSES SHOW THAT THE ADDITION OF BIOCHAR CAN STIMULATE CERTAIN GROUPS OF BACTERIA INVOLVED IN CARBON AND NITROGEN CYCLES AND POSSIBLY THOSE INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PLANTS. THIS REVIEW IDENTIFIES THE IMPORTANT PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE BIOCHARS, WHICH WILL BE ABLE TO BETTER GUIDE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS AND INDUSTRIES MANUFACTURING SUBSTRATES CONTAINING PEAT, IN THE CHOICE OF A BIOCHAR FAVORABLE TO THE GROWTH OF PLANTS AND A MORE DURABLE AGRICULTURE.";PROGRESS ON THE AMENDMENT IN BIOCHARS AND ITS EFFECTS ON THE SOIL-PLANT-MICRO-ORGANISM-BIOCHAR SYSTEM;REVIEWS ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH;REVIEW;SEP;2018;10.1515/reveh-2018-0007;"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; PUBLIC, ENVIRONMENTAL & OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH";WOS:000443809800006

WITH THE ABSORPTION OF ATMOSPHERIC METHANE (CH4), UPLAND SOILS BECOME A LARGE CO2 SOURCE AND CH4 SINK. THESE SOIL CARBON (C) FLUXES ARE KEY FACTORS IN THE MITIGATION AND ADAPTION OF FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE. THE ASIAN REGION SPANS AN EXTENSIVE AREA FROM THE NORTHERN BOREAL TO TROPICAL REGIONS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. AS THIS REGION IS CHARACTERISED BY HIGHLY DIVERSE ECOSYSTEMS, IT IS EXPECTED TO EXPERIENCE THE STRONG IMPACT OF ECOSYSTEM RESPONSES TO GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. FOR THE PAST TWO DECADES, RESEARCHERS IN THE ASIAFLUX COMMUNITY HAVE MEANINGFULLY CONTRIBUTED TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF SOIL C DYNAMICS, RESPONSE OF SOIL C FLUXES TO DISTURBANCES AND CLIMATE CHANGE, AND REGIONAL AND GLOBAL ESTIMATION BASED ON MODEL ANALYSIS. THIS REVIEW FOCUSES ON FIVE IMPORTANT ASPECTS: 1) THE HISTORICAL METHODOLOGY FOR SOIL C FLUX MEASUREMENT; 2) RESPONSES OF SOIL C FLUX COMPONENTS TO ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS; 3) SOIL C FLUXES IN TYPICAL ECOSYSTEMS IN ASIA; 4) THE INFLUENCE OF DISTURBANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE ON SOIL C FLUXES; AND 5) MODEL ANALYSIS AND THE ESTIMATION OF SOIL C FLUXES IN RESEARCH LARGELY FOCUSED IN ASIA.";SOIL CARBON FLUX RESEARCH IN THE ASIAN REGION: REVIEW AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES;JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL METEOROLOGY;REVIEW;JAN;2021;10.2480/agrmet.D-20-00013;"AGRICULTURE, MULTIDISCIPLINARY; METEOROLOGY & ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES";WOS:000609163000003
LAAMRANI A, 2020, FORESTS;"LAAMRANI A;VALERIA O;CHEHBOUNI A;BERGERON Y";NORTHERN BOREAL FORESTS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY ACCUMULATION OF ACCUMULATION OF PEAT (E.G., KNOWN AS PALUDIFICATION). THE FUNCTIONING OF NORTHERN BOREAL FOREST SPECIES AND THEIR CAPACITY TO ADAPT TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES APPEAR TO DEPEND ON SOIL CONDITIONS. CLIMATE WARMING IS EXPECTED TO HAVE PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED EFFECTS ON PALUDIFIED BOREAL ECOSYSTEMS AND CAN ALTER CURRENT FOREST SPECIES COMPOSITION AND ADAPTATION BY CHANGING SOIL CONDITIONS SUCH AS MOISTURE, TEMPERATURE REGIMES, AND SOIL RESPIRATION. IN THIS PAPER, WE REVIEW AND SYNTHESIZE RESULTS FROM VARIOUS REPORTED STUDIES (I.E., 88 RESEARCH ARTICLES CITED HEREAFTER) TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATIC WARMING ON SOIL CONDITIONS OF PALUDIFIED FORESTS IN NORTH AMERICA. PREDICTIONS THAT GLOBAL WARMING MAY INCREASE THE DECOMPOSITION RATE MUST BE CONSIDERED IN COMBINATION WITH ITS IMPACT ON SOIL MOISTURE, WHICH APPEARS TO BE A LIMITING FACTOR. LOCAL ADAPTATION OR ACCLIMATION TO CURRENT CLIMATIC CONDITIONS IS OCCURRING IN BOREAL FORESTS, WHICH IS LIKELY TO BE IMPORTANT FOR CONTINUED ECOSYSTEM STABILITY IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE MOST COMMONLY CITED RESPONSE OF BOREAL FOREST SPECIES TO GLOBAL WARMING IS A NORTHWARD MIGRATION THAT TRACKS THE CLIMATE AND SOIL CONDITIONS (E.G., TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE) TO WHICH THEY ARE ADAPTED. YET, SOME CONSTRAINTS MAY INFLUENCE THIS KIND OF ADAPTATION, SUCH AS WATER AVAILABILITY, CHANGES IN FIRE REGIMES, DECOMPOSER ADAPTATIONS, AND THE DYNAMIC OF PEAT ACCUMULATION. IN THIS PAPER, AS A STUDY CASE, WE EXAMINED AN EXAMPLE OF POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF CLIMATIC WARMING ON FUTURE PALUDIFICATION CHANGES IN THE EASTERN LOWLAND REGION OF CANADA THROUGH THREE DIFFERENT COMBINED HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOS BASED ON TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION (E.G., UNCHANGED, INCREASE, OR DECREASE). AN INCREASE SCENARIO IN PRECIPITATION WILL LIKELY FAVOR PEAT ACCUMULATION IN BOREAL FOREST STANDS PRONE TO PALUDIFICATION AND FACILITATE FORESTED PEATLAND EXPANSION INTO UPLAND FOREST, WHILE DECREASED OR UNCHANGED PRECIPITATION COMBINED WITH AN INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE WILL PROBABLY FAVOR SUCCESSION OF FORESTED PEATLANDS TO UPLAND BOREAL FORESTS. EACH OF THE THREE SCENARIOS WERE DISCUSSED IN THIS STUDY, AND CONSEQUENT SILVICULTURAL TREATMENT OPTIONS WERE SUGGESTED FOR EACH SCENARIO TO COPE WITH ANTICIPATED SOIL AND SPECIES CHANGES IN THE BOREAL FORESTS. WE CONCLUDED THAT, DESPITE THE FACT BOREAL SOILS WILL NOT CONSTRAIN ADAPTATION OF BOREAL FORESTS, SOME CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATIC WARMING MAY REDUCE THE ABILITY OF CERTAIN SPECIES TO RESPOND TO NATURAL DISTURBANCES SUCH AS PEST AND DISEASE OUTBREAKS, AND EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS.;ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF CLIMATE WARMING ON PALUDIFICATION PROCESSES: WILL SOIL CONDITIONS LIMIT THE ADAPTATION OF NORTHERN BOREAL FORESTS TO CLIMATE CHANGE?

CHEN ML, 2020, ENVIRON SCI ECOTECH;"CHEN ML;CHANG L;ZHANG JM;GUO FC;VYMAZAL J;HE Q;CHEN Y";GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY PROMOTED BY GLOBAL NITROGEN INPUT FOR CHANGING THE RATE OF SOIL CARBON AND NITROGEN CYCLING, AND ARE SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTED BY SOIL LABILE CARBON AND NITROGEN CONVERSELY. HOWEVER, THE DRIVING MECHANISM BY WHICH SOIL LABILE CARBON AND NITROGEN AFFECT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM WETLAND ECOSYSTEMS UNDER GLOBAL NITROGEN INPUT IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. WORKING OUT THE DRIVING FACTOR OF NITROGEN INPUT ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS IS CRITICAL TO REDUCING GLOBAL WARMING FROM NITROGEN INPUT. THUS, WE SYNTHESIZED 72 PUBLISHED STUDIES (2144 PAIRED OBSERVATIONS) OF GREENHOUSE GAS FLUXES AND SOIL LABILE COMPOUNDS OF CARBON AND NITROGEN (AMMONIUM, NITRATE, DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON, SOIL MICROBIAL BIOMASS NITROGEN AND CARBON), TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF LABILE CARBON AND NITROGEN ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS UNDER GLOBAL NITROGEN INPUT. ACROSS THE DATA SET, NITROGEN INPUT SIGNIFICANTLY PROMOTED CARBON DIOXIDE, METHANE AND NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS. IN PARTICULAR, AT LOWER NITROGEN RATES (<100 KG HA(-1).YR(-1)) AND WITH ADDED AMMONIUM COMPOUNDS, FRESHWATER WETLAND SIGNIFICANTLY PROMOTED CARBON DIOXIDE AND METHANE EMISSIONS. PEATLAND WAS THE LARGEST NITROUS OXIDE SOURCE UNDER THESE CONDITIONS. THIS META-ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALED THAT NITROGEN INPUT STIMULATED DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON, AMMONIUM, NITRATE, MICROBIAL BIOMASS CARBON AND MICROBIAL BIOMASS NITROGEN ACCUMULATION IN THE WETLAND ECOSYSTEM. THE VARIATION-PARTITIONING ANALYSIS AND STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL WERE USED TO ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GREENHOUSE GAS AND LABILE CARBON AND NITROGEN FURTHER. THESE RESULTS REVEALED THAT DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC) IS THE PRIMARY FACTOR DRIVING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION FROM WETLANDS UNDER GLOBAL NITROGEN INPUT, WHEREAS MICROBIAL BIOMASS CARBON (MBC) MORE DIRECTLY AFFECTS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION THAN OTHER LABILE CARBON AND NITROGEN.

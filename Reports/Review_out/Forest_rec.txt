OBJECTIVE THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICE HOT-SPOTS, AND FACTORS THAT CHARACTERIZE SUCH HOT-SPOTS AND DEFINE THE SPATIAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN SOUTHERN PATAGONIA (ARGENTINA). METHODS THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN SOUTHERN PATAGONIA (243.9 THOUSAND KM 2) LOCATED BETWEEN 46 DEGREES AND 55 DEGREES SL WITH THE ANDES MOUNTAINS ON THE WESTERN FRINGE AND THE ATLANTIC OCEAN ON THE EASTERN FRINGE OF THE STUDY AREA. THE STUDY REGION HAS A RANGE OF DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES (GRASSLANDS, SHRUB-LANDS, PEAT-LANDS AND FORESTS) THOUGH THE COLD ARID STEPPE IS THE MAIN VEGETATION TYPE. WE USED GEO-TAGGED DIGITAL IMAGES THAT LOCAL PEOPLE AND VISITORS POSTED IN THE PANORAMIO WEB PLATFORM TO IDENTIFY HOT-SPOTS OF FOUR CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES (AESTHETIC VALUE, EXISTENCE VALUE, RECREATION AND LOCAL IDENTITY) AND RELATE THESE HOT-SPOTS WITH SOCIAL AND BIOPHYSICAL LANDSCAPE FEATURES. RESULTS AESTHETIC VALUE WAS THE MAIN CULTURAL SERVICE TAGGED BY PEOPLE, FOLLOWED BY THE EXISTENCE VALUE FOR BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, FOLLOWED BY LOCAL IDENTITY AND THEN RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY. THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THESE CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT SOCIAL AND BIOPHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS THE PRESENCE OF WATER BODIES, VEGETATION TYPES, MARINE AND TERRESTRIAL FAUNA, PROTECTED AREAS, URBANIZATION, ACCESSIBILITY AND TOURISM OFFER. THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS ARE THE PRESENCE OF WATER IN SANTA CRUZ AND TOURISM OFFER IN TIERRA DEL FUEGO. CONCLUSIONS OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS METHODOLOGY IS USEFUL FOR ASSESSING CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AT THE REGIONAL SCALE, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WITH LOW DATA AVAILABILITY AND FIELD ACCESSIBILITY, SUCH AS SOUTHERN PATAGONIA. WE ALSO IDENTIFY NEW RESEARCH CHALLENGES THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED IN CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES RESEARCH THROUGH THE USE OF THIS METHOD.","SPATIAL PATTERNS OF CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES PROVISION IN SOUTHERN PATAGONIA","LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","ARTICLE","FEB",2016,"10.1007/s10980-015-0254-9","ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY, PHYSICAL; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000372318900014"

BY DEFINITION, THE ACTIVE LAYER IS THE LAYER ABOVE PERMAFROST THAT FREEZES AND THAWS ANNUALLY. THIS STUDY, CONDUCTED IN PEATLANDS OF SUBARCTIC CANADA, IN THE ZONE OF THAWING DISCONTINUOUS PERMAFROST, DEMONSTRATES THAT THE ENTIRE THICKNESS OF GROUND ATOP PERMAFROST DOES NOT ALWAYS REFREEZE OVER WINTER. IN THESE INSTANCES, A TALIK EXISTS BETWEEN THE PERMAFROST AND ACTIVE LAYER, AND ALT MUST THEREFORE BE MEASURED BY THE DEPTH OF REFREEZE AT THE END OF WINTER. AS TALIK THICKNESS INCREASES AT THE EXPENSE OF THE UNDERLYING PERMAFROST, ALT IS SHOWN TO SIMULTANEOUSLY DECREASE. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE ACTIVE LAYER HAS A MAXIMUM THICKNESS THAT IS CONTROLLED BY THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY LOST FROM THE GROUND TO THE ATMOSPHERE DURING WINTER. THE TALIKS DOCUMENTED IN THIS STUDY ARE RELATIVELY THIN (<2M) AND EXIST ON FORESTED PEAT PLATEAUS. THE PRESENCE OF TALIKS GREATLY AFFECTS THE STABILITY OF THE UNDERLYING PERMAFROST. VERTICAL PERMAFROST THAW WAS FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IN AREAS WITH TALIKS (0.07MYEAR(-1)) THAN WITHOUT (0.01MYEAR(-1)). FURTHERMORE, THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF AREAS WITH TALIKS INCREASED BETWEEN 2011 AND 2015 FROM 20% TO 48%, A PHENOMENON LIKELY CAUSED BY AN ANOMALOUSLY LARGE GROUND HEAT FLUX INPUT IN 2012. RAPID TALIK DEVELOPMENT AND ACCELERATED PERMAFROST THAW INDICATES THAT PERMAFROST LOSS MAY EXHIBIT A NONLINEAR RESPONSE TO WARMING TEMPERATURES.

DURING THE STUDY, 24 FORESTRY DRAINED SITES WERE RESTORED AND 19 PRISTINE PEATLANDS USED AS CONTROL SITES. DIFFERENT APPROACHES WERE DEVELOPED AND USED TO ANALYZE WT CHANGES (MEAN WT POSITION, WT FLUCTUATION, WT HYDROGRAPH, RECESSION, AND STORAGE CHARACTERISTICS). RESTORATION INCREASED WT IN MOST CASES BUT PARTICULARLY IN SPRUCE MIRES, FOLLOWED BY PINE MIRES AND FENS. BEFORE RESTORATION, THE WT FLUCTUATION (WTF) WAS LARGE, INDICATING PEAT TEMPORARY STORAGE GAIN (SG).

DRAINAGE, NECESSARY FOR AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY, TRIGGERS RAPID DECOMPOSITION OF SOIL ORGANIC MATTER (SOM), TYPICALLY INCREASING IN THE ORDER FOREST < GRASSLAND < CROPLAND. HOWEVER, THERE IS ALSO LARGE VARIATION IN DECOMPOSITION DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS, CLIMATE AND SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT. HERE WE STUDIED THE ROLE OF SOM COMPOSITION ON PEAT DECOMPOSABILITY IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENTLY MANAGED DRAINED ORGANIC SOILS. WE COLLECTED A TOTAL OF 560 SAMPLES FROM 21 ORGANIC CROPLAND, GRASSLAND AND FOREST SOILS IN SWITZERLAND, MONITORED THEIR CO2 EMISSION RATES IN LAB INCUBATION EXPERIMENTS OVER 6 MONTHS AT TWO TEMPERATURES (10 AND 20 DEGREES C) AND RELATED THEM TO VARIOUS SOIL CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING BULK DENSITY, PH, SOIL ORGANIC CARBON (SOC) CONTENT AND ELEMENTAL RATIOS (C = N, H / C AND O / C). CO2 RELEASE RANGED FROM 6 TO 195 MG CO(2-)CG(-1) SOC AT 10 DEGREES C AND FROM 12 TO 423 MG G(-1) AT 20 DEGREES C. THIS VARIATION OCCURRING UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS SUGGESTS THAT BESIDES SOIL WATER REGIME, WEATHER AND MANAGEMENT, SOM COMPOSITION MAY BE AN UNDERESTIMATED FACTOR THAT DETERMINES CO2 FLUXES MEASURED IN FIELD EXPERIMENTS. HOWEVER, CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE INVESTIGATED CHEMICAL SOM CHARACTERISTICS AND CO2 EMISSIONS WERE WEAK. THE LATTER ALSO DID NOT SHOW A DEPENDENCE ON LAND-USE TYPE, ALTHOUGH PEAT UNDER FOREST WAS DECOMPOSED THE LEAST. HIGH CO2 EMISSIONS IN SOME TOPSOILS WERE PROBABLY RELATED TO THE ACCRUAL OF LABILE CROP RESIDUES. A COMPARISON WITH PUBLISHED CO2 RATES FROM INCUBATED MINERAL SOILS INDICATED NO DIFFERENCE IN SOM DECOMPOSABILITY BETWEEN THESE SOIL CLASSES, SUGGESTING THAT ACCUMULATION OF RECENT, LABILE PLANT MATERIALS THAT PRESUMABLY ACCOUNT FOR MOST OF THE EVOLVED CO2 IS NOT SYSTEMATICALLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN MINERAL AND ORGANIC SOILS. IN OUR DATA SET, TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY OF DECOMPOSITION (Q(10) ON AVERAGE 2.57 +/- 0.05) WAS THE SAME FOR ALL LAND USES BUT LOWEST BELOW 60 CM IN CROPLANDS AND GRASSLANDS.

TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON (TOC) AND KMNO4-OXIDIZABLE CARBON (KOC) DEFINED AS THE LABILE SOC FRACTION WERE MEASURED IN BOTH PEAT AND MINERAL SOILS. FIBRE AND LIGNIN WERE ALSO DETERMINED IN PEAT SAMPLES. THE MINERAL-ASSOCIATED ORGANIC CARBON (MOC) AND BLACK CARBON WERE EXAMINED AS TWO RECALCITRANT SOC FRACTIONS. IN PEAT SOIL PROFILES, THE TOC AND KOC CONTENTS INCREASED WITH THE INCREASING DEPTH ACROSS ALL LAND USES. THE CONVERSION OF PEATLAND TO PADDY FIELD CAN AFFECT TOC CONTENT AT EACH PEAT SOIL DEPTH. THE KOC CONTENT WAS LOWER IN CULTIVATED SOILS, INDICATING THAT CULTIVATION DECREASED KOC. THE KOC DECREASE WAS SMALLER THAN THE TOC DECREASE, INDICATING THAT SOME RECALCITRANT SOC FRACTIONS WERE DECOMPOSED BECAUSE OF LAND USE CHANGE. UNLIKE PEAT SOIL PROFILES, THE TOC AND KOC CONTENTS DECREASED WITH DEPTH IN MINERAL SOIL PROFILES ACROSS ALL LAND USES.

FIELD CALIBRATION OF THE LIDAR DATA ENABLED THE GENERATION OF GRID-BASED MAPS OF AGB FOR 2006 AND 2011, AND THE RESULTING AGB CHANGE WAS ESTIMATED.

WITH A LONG-TERM WATER BALANCE APPROACH TO THE ARB, WE INVESTIGATE REASONS WHY DOWNSTREAM MEAN ANNUAL STREAM FLOW RATES ARE CONSISTENTLY HIGHER THAN UPSTREAM, DESPITE THE SUBHUMID WATER DEFICIT CONDITIONS IN THE DOWNSTREAM REGIMES. A HIGH-RESOLUTION 3D VARIABLY SATURATED SUBSURFACE AND SURFACE WATER FLOW AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION MODEL OF THE ARB IS CONSTRUCTED BASED ON THE BEDROCK AND SURFICIAL GEOLOGY AND THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF PEATLANDS AND THEIR CORRESPONDING ECO-REGIONS. HISTORICAL CLIMATE DATA WERE USED TO DRIVE THE MODEL FOR CALIBRATION AGAINST 40-YEAR LONG-TERM AVERAGE SURFACE FLOW AND GROUNDWATER OBSERVATIONS DURING THE HISTORIC INSTRUMENTAL PERIOD. THE SIMULATION RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT AT THE BASIN-SCALE, PEATLANDS AND FORESTLANDS CAN HAVE A STRONG INFLUENCE ON THE SURFACE-SUBSURFACE HYDROLOGIC SYSTEMS. IN PARTICULAR, PEATLANDS IN THE MIDSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM REGIMES OF THE ARB INCREASE THE WATER AVAILABILITY TO THE SURFACE-SUBSURFACE WATER SYSTEMS BY REDUCING WATER LOSS THROUGH EVAPOTRANSPIRATION. BASED ON THE COMPARISON OF FORESTLAND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION BETWEEN OBSERVATION AND SIMULATION, THE OVERALL SPATIAL AVERAGE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION IN DOWNSTREAM FORESTLANDS IS LARGER THAN THAT IN PEATLANDS AND THUS THE WATER CONTRIBUTION TO THE STREAM FLOW IN DOWNSTREAM AREAS IS RELATIVELY MINOR. THEREFORE, APPROPRIATE REPRESENTATION OF PEATLANDS AND FORESTLANDS WITHIN THE BASIN-SCALE HYDROLOGIC MODEL IS CRITICAL TO REPRODUCE THE WATER BALANCE OF THE ARB.","UNDERSTANDING THE WATER BALANCE PARADOX IN THE ATHABASCA RIVER BASIN, CANADA","HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES","ARTICLE","MAR 15",2018,"10.1002/hyp.11449","WATER RESOURCES","WOS:000427118400003"

FOUR ORGANIC SOILS (HISTOSOLS) AND ONE ORGANO-MINERAL SOIL (HISTIC GLEYSOL) WERE STUDIED. THE SURFACE SOIL HORIZONS WERE MAINLY TRANSFORMED DUE TO LONG-TERM FORESTRY DRAINAGE. INCREASED AERATION OF THESE LAYERS HAD ENHANCED THEIR CONTENT OF LABILE FORMS OF CARBON AND THEY WERE UNDERGOING SECONDARY TRANSFORMATION. SOIL TRANSFORMATION WAS MORE ADVANCED IN FEN PEATLANDS THAN IN TRANSITIONAL MIRE OR RAISED BOGS. ONLY THE FENS EXHIBITED CHARACTERISTIC EVIDENCE OF THE MOORSH-FORMING PROCESS. FURTHER DRYING OF THESE SOILS WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT THEIR REWETTING POTENTIAL AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE EFFECTIVE APPLICATION OF RESTORATION TREATMENTS. IN ORDER TO REDUCE ORGANIC MATTER TRANSFORMATION AND LOSS FROM THE INVESTIGATED PEATLAND AREAS, THEIR DRAINAGE DITCHES SHOULD BE BLOCKED.

WE MEASURED PORE WATER TOTAL HG, MEHG, DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER CHARACTERISTICS AND GENERAL WATER CHEMISTRY PARAMETERS TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF PERMAFROST THAW ON THE PATTERN OF WATER CHEMISTRY. A GRADIENT IN VEGETATION COMPOSITION, WATER CHEMISTRY AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER CHARACTERISTICS FOLLOWED A TOPOSEQUENCE FROM THE OMBROTROPHIC BOGS NEAR THE CREST OF THE COMPLEX TO POOR FENS AT ITS DOWNSLOPE MARGINS. WE FOUND THAT PORE WATERS IN POOR FENS CONTAINED ELEVATED LEVELS OF MEHG, AND THE WATER DRAINING FROM THESE FEATURES HAD DISSOLVED MEHG CONCENTRATIONS 4.5 TO 14.5 TIMES HIGHER THAN THE WATER DRAINING FROM THE BOGS.

NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE (NEE) OF CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) WAS MEASURED WITH THE EDDY COVARIANCE METHOD FROM A MAST ABOVE THE FOREST. SOIL AND FOREST FLOOR CO2 AND METHANE (CH4) FLUXES WERE MEASURED FROM THE STRIPS AND FROM DITCHES WITH CLOSED CHAMBERS.

SOIL CO2 BALANCE WAS ESTIMATED BY SUBTRACTING THE CARBON SINK OF THE GROWING TREE STAND FROM NEE, AND IT SHOWED THAT THE SOIL ITSELF WAS A CARBON SINK AS WELL. A DROUGHT PERIOD IN ONE SUMMER SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED THE SINK THROUGH DECREASED GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION. DROUGHT ALSO DECREASED ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION.

ONE INTERESTING OPTION IS TO USE BIOMASS FLY ASHES IN HARDENING APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS EARTH CONSTRUCTION. IN THIS STUDY, THE SELF HARDENING OF GROUND FLY ASH FROM A FINNISH POWER PLANT WITH A BUBBLING FLUIDIZED BED BOILER THAT BURNS FOREST INDUSTRY RESIDUALS AND PEAT WAS INVESTIGATED. FLY ASH WAS GROUND WITH THREE DIFFERENT MILLS, NAMELY, TUMBLING BALL MILL, IMPACT MILL, AND JET MILL, TO DIFFERENT PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE AMOUNT OF REACTIVE COMPONENTS FOR GROUND FLY ASH SAMPLES WAS MORE OR LESS THE SAME WITH THE ORIGINAL SAMPLE, BUT THE PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION WAS DIFFERENT. MOREOVER, THE WATER REQUIREMENT FOR SELF-HARDENING SAMPLES WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE GRINDING MECHANISM. WHEN PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION WAS WIDER (AFTER BALL AND IMPACT MILLING), THE WATER REQUIREMENT WAS MUCH LOWER DUE TO THE BETTER PACKING OF THE PARTICLES. A SMALLER WATER REQUIREMENT ALSO LED TO GREATER COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH EVEN THE FLY ASH SAMPLES WERE CHEMICALLY AND MINERALOGICALLY THE SAME. AFTER BALL MILLING, OBTAINING FOUR TIMES HIGHER SELF-HARDENING COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH, FROM 5 MPA TO 20 MPA, WAS POSSIBLE. FOR JET MILLED FLY ASH, THE PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION WAS NARROW DUE TO THE CLASSIFIER IN THE MILL, AND THE WATER REQUIREMENT WAS HIGH.

THE N-2 PREP UNIT HAS GAS PURIFICATION STEPS AND A COPPER-BASED REDUCTION FURNACE, AND ALLOWS THE ANALYSIS OF SMALL GAS INJECTION VOLUMES (4 MU L) FOR N-15-N-2 ANALYSIS. FOR THE ANALYSIS OF N2O, AN AUTOMATED TRACEGAS PRECONCENTRATOR (ISOPRIME LTD) COUPLED TO AN IRMS WAS USED TO MEASURE THE N-15-N2O (4 ML GAS INJECTION VOLUME). CONSEQUENTLY, THE COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION FOR THE DETERMINATION OF ISOTOPE RATIOS FOR N-2 IN AIR AND IN STANDARD N2O (0.5 PPM) WAS BETTER THAN 0.5 %.

THE DATA WERE SUMMARIZED BY BOG, POOR FEN AND RICH-INTERMEDIATE FEN CATEGORIES FOR THE SEVEN MAJOR PEATLAND CONTAINING TERRESTRIAL ECOZONES (ATLANTIC MARITIME, MIXEDWOOD PLAINS, BOREAL SHIELD, BOREAL PLAINS, HUDSON PLAINS, TAIGA SHIELD, TAIGA PLAINS) THAT COMPRISE > 96% OF ALL PEATLANDS NATIONALLY. REPORTS OF MULTIPLE YEARS OF DATA FROM A SINGLE SITE WERE AVERAGED AND DIFFERENT MICROFORMS (E.G., HUMMOCK OR HOLLOW) WITHIN THESE PEATLAND TYPES WERE KEPT SEPARATE. A NEW PEATLANDS MAP WAS CREATED FROM FOREST COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE INFORMATION THAT DISTINGUISHES BOG FROM RICH AND POOR FEN. NATIONAL FOREST INVENTORY K-NN FOREST STRUCTURE MAPS, BIOCLIMATIC VARIABLES (MEAN DIURNAL RANGE AND SEASONALITY OF TEMPERATURES) AND GROUND SURFACE SLOPE WERE USED TO CONSTRUCT THE NEW MAP. THE EARTH OBSERVATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT MAP OF WETLANDS WAS USED TO IDENTIFY OPEN PEATLANDS WITH MINOR TREE COVER. RESULTS: THE NEW MAP WAS COMBINED WITH AVERAGES OF OBSERVED NEE AND CH4 EMISSIONS TO ESTIMATE A GROWING SEASON INTEGRATED NEE (+/- SE) AT - 108.8 (+/- 41.3) MT CO2 SEASON(-1) AND CH4 EMISSION AT 4.1 (+/- 1.5) MT CH4 SEASON(-1) FOR THE SEVEN ECOZONES. CONVERTING CH4 TO CO2 EQUIVALENT (CO2 E; GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL OF 25 OVER 100 YEARS) RESULTED IN A TOTAL NET SINK OF - 7.0 (+/- 77.6) MT CO2 E SEASON(-1) FOR CANADA. BOREAL PLAINS PEATLANDS CONTRIBUTED MOST TO THE NEE SINK DUE TO HIGH CO2 UPTAKE RATES AND LARGE PEATLAND AREAS, WHILE BOREAL SHIELD PEATLANDS CONTRIBUTED MOST TO CH4 EMISSIONS DUE TO MODERATE EMISSION RATES AND LARGE PEATLAND AREAS.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO QUANTIFY CHANGES IN EROSION/DEPOSITION QUANTITIES AND SURFACE ROUGHNESS IN PEATLAND FOREST DITCHES BY MEASURING CHANGES IN DITCH CROSS-SECTIONS AND SURFACE MICROTOPOGRAPHY WITH TWO ALTERNATIVE METHODS: MANUAL PIN METER AND TERRESTRIAL LASER SCANNING (TSL). THE METHODS WERE APPLIED TO A PEAT DITCH AND A DITCH WITH A THIN PEAT LAYER OVERLAYING EROSION SENSITIVE MINERAL SOIL WITHIN A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS FOLLOWING DITCH CLEANING. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT EROSION WAS GREATER IN THE DITCH WITH EXPOSED MINERAL SOIL THAN IN THE PEAT DITCH. THE TWO METHODS REVEALED RATHER SIMILAR ESTIMATES OF EROSION AND DEPOSITION FOR THE DITCH WITH THE THIN PEAT LAYER WHERE CROSS-SECTIONAL CHANGES WERE LARGE, WHEREAS THE RESULTS FOR SMALLER SCALE EROSION AND DEPOSITION AT THE PEAT DITCH DIFFERED. THE TLS-BASED EROSION AND DEPOSITION QUANTITIES DEPENDED ON THE SIZE OF THE SAMPLING WINDOW USED IN THE ESTIMATIONS. SURFACE ROUGHNESS WAS SMALLER WHEN CALCULATED FROM THE PIN METER DATA THAN FROM THE TLS DATA. BOTH METHODS INDICATED THAT ROUGHNESS INCREASED IN THE BANKS OF THE DITCH WITH A THIN PEAT LAYER. TLS DATA SHOWED INCREASED ROUGHNESS ALSO IN THE PEAT DITCH. THE INCREASE IN SURFACE ROUGHNESS WAS ATTRIBUTED TO EROSION AND GROWTH OF VEGETATION. BOTH METHODS WERE SUITABLE FOR THE MEASUREMENTS OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS AND MICROTOPOGRAPHY AT THE DITCH CROSS-SECTION SCALE, BUT THE APPLICABILITY, RIGOUR, AND EASE OF ACQUISITION OF TLS DATA WERE MORE EVIDENT. THE MAIN DISADVANTAGE OF THE TLS INSTRUMENT (LEICA SCANSTATION 2) COMPARED WITH PIN METER WAS THAT EVEN A SHALLOW LAYER OF HUMIC (DARK BROWN) WATER PREVENTED DETECTION OF THE DITCH BED.

IN CLEAR-CUTTING, STEM WOOD IS REMOVED AND THE LOGGING RESIDUES ARE EITHER REMOVED OR LEFT ON SITE. CLEAR-CUTTING CHANGES THE MICROCLIMATE AND VEGETATION STRUCTURE AT THE SITE, BOTH OF WHICH AFFECT THE SITE'S CARBON BALANCE. PEAT SOILS WITH POOR AERATION AND HIGH CARBON DENSITIES ARE ESPECIALLY PRONE TO SUCH CHANGES, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN GREENHOUSE GAS EXCHANGE CAN BE EXPECTED. WE MEASURED CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) AND ENERGY FLUXES WITH THE EDDY COVARIANCE METHOD FOR 2 YEARS (APRIL 2016-MARCH 2018) AFTER CLEAR-CUTTING A DRAINED PEATLAND FOREST. WE OBSERVED A SIGNIFICANT RISE (23 CM) IN THE WATER TABLE LEVEL AND A LARGE CO2 SOURCE (FIRST YEAR: 3086 +/- 148 G CO2 M(-2) YR(-1); SECOND YEAR: 2072 +/- 124 G CO2 M(-2) YR(-1)). THESE LARGE CO2 EMISSIONS RESULTED FROM THE VERY LOW GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION (GPP) FOLLOWING THE REMOVAL OF PHOTOSYNTHESIZING TREES AND THE DECLINE OF GROUND VEGETATION, UNABLE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE DECOMPOSITION OF LOGGING RESIDUES AND PEAT. DURING THE SECOND SUMMER (JUNE-AUGUST) AFTER THE CLEAR-CUTTING, GPP HAD ALREADY INCREASED BY 96% AND TOTAL ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION DECREASED BY 14% FROM THE PREVIOUS SUMMER.

IN APRIL-SEPTEMBER, THE MEAN DAYTIME SENSIBLE HEAT FLUX WAS 33% LOWER AND LATENT HEAT FLUX 40% HIGHER IN 2017, PROBABLY DUE TO THE RECOVERY OF GROUND VEGETATION THAT INCREASED EVAPOTRANSPIRATION AND ALBEDO OF THE SITE. IN ADDITION TO CO2 AND ENERGY FLUXES, WE MEASURED METHANE (CH4) AND NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) FLUXES WITH MANUAL CHAMBERS.

HOWEVER, THE USE OF EXPONENTIAL REGRESSION WITH SMALL FLUXES (<2.5 MU GCH(4) M(-2) H(-1)) TYPICALLY RESULTED IN ANOMALOUSLY LARGE ABSOLUTE FLUXES AND HIGH HOUR-TO-HOUR DEVIATIONS.

WE FOUND SIMILAR OVERALL DEPTHS PATTERNS OF DELTA C-13 AND DELTA N-15 ACROSS THE NINE DEPTH PROFILES AND DISTINCT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AEROBIC AND ANAEROBIC PEAT LAYERS. CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES IN STABLE C AND N ISOTOPE SIGNATURES OF SAME DEPTHS WERE DETECTED BETWEEN PROFILES OF THE THREE CLASSES, WHEREAS DEPTH PROFILES OF PEAT CORES WITH SIMILAR DEGREE IN PEATLAND DEGRADATION WERE NEARLY IDENTICAL. IN THE AEROBIC PEAT LAYERS, DELTA C-13 AND DELTA N-15 INCREASED WITH DEPTHS AT ALL STUDY SITES FROM 2.6 PARTS PER THOUSAND TO 4.9 PARTS PER THOUSAND FOR DELTA C-13 AND 3.2 PARTS PER THOUSAND TO 7.0 PARTS PER THOUSAND FOR DELTA N-15 COMPARED TO THE INITIAL SIGNATURES OF THE PLANT BIOMASS. STANDARDISED DELTA C-13 OF AEROBIC LAYERS DIFFER DISTINCTLY BETWEEN SLIGHTLY DEGRADED PESTS AT THE OPEN PEAT BOG AREA, INTERMEDIATELY DEGRADED PEATS AT THE TREE-COVERED EDGE AREAS AND STRONGLY DEGRADED PESTS AT THE FORMER PEAT-CUTTING SITE. DELTA C-13 SIGNATURES OF AEROBIC LAYERS OF STRONGLY DEGRADED PESTS WERE MARKEDLY MORE NEGATIVE COMPARED TO THE SLIGHTLY DEGRADED PEATS BECAUSE OF THE SELECTIVE C-12 LOSSES BY MICROBIAL RESPIRATION. DELTA N-15 WERE MORE POSITIVE AT STRONGLY DEGRADED THAN AT SLIGHTLY DEGRADED SITES IN BOTH, AEROBIC AND ANAEROBIC PEAT LAYERS. THE UNIFORM STABLE ISOTOPE RATIOS IN THE ANAEROBIC LAYERS DEEPER THAN THE LOCAL MAXIMA OF THE ISOTOPIC SIGNATURES SUPPORT THE ASSUMPTION THAT MINOR C-13 FRACTIONATION OCCURS UNDER ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS. DELTA C-13 SLIGHTLY DECLINING WITH DEPTH IN THE WATERLOGGED LAYERS OF STRONGLY DEGRADED PEAT REFLECTS THE PREFERENTIAL UTILISATION AND LOSS OF LABILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS ENRICHED IN C-13.

IN ORDER TO RELATE HYDROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS TO KEY EROSION PROCESSES IN HEADWATER PEATLANDS DRAINED FOR FORESTRY, A TWO-YEAR STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN A NESTED SUB-CATCHMENT SYSTEM (TREATED WITH DITCH CLEANING) AND AT TWO REFERENCE SITES. THE TREATED CATCHMENT WAS INSTRUMENTED FOR CONTINUOUS DISCHARGE AND TURBIDITY MONITORING, EROSION PIN MEASUREMENTS OF CHANGES IN DITCH BED AND BANKS AND TIME-INTEGRATED SAMPLING OF SUSPENDED SEDIMENT (SS) COMPOSITION. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT DITCH CLEANING CLEARLY INCREASED TRANSIENT SUSPENDED SEDIMENT CONCENTRATIONS (SSCS) AND SUSPENDED SEDIMENT YIELDS (SSYS), AND RESULTED IN TEMPORARY STORAGE OF LOOSELY DEPOSITED ORGANIC SEDIMENT IN THE DITCH NETWORK. AFTER EXHAUSTION OF THIS SEDIMENT STORAGE, SUBAERIAL PROCESSES AND EROSION FROM DITCH BANKS BECAME DOMINANT IN PRODUCING SEDIMENT FOR TRANSPORT. RECORDED SSCS WERE HIGHER ON THE RISING LIMBS OF EVENT HYDROGRAPHS THROUGHOUT THE STUDY PERIOD, INDICATING THAT SS TRANSPORT WAS LIMITED BY AVAILABILITY OF EROSION-PRONE SEDIMENT. A STRONG POSITIVE CORRELATION (R-2=0.84, P<0.001) BETWEEN RAINFALL INTENSITY (ABOVE A THRESHOLD OF 1MMH(-1)) AND AVERAGE SSC OBTAINED ON THE RISING LIMB OF HYDROGRAPHS FOR THE SUB-CATCHMENT SHOWED THAT SOIL DETACHMENT FROM DITCH BANKS BY RAINDROP IMPACT CAN DIRECTLY INCREASE SSC IN RUNOFF.

THIS STUDY PRESENTS A MODELING APPROACH TO INVESTIGATE SEDIMENT TRANSPORT IN A PEATLAND DITCH NETWORK. THE TRANSPORT MODEL DESCRIBES BED EROSION, RAIN-INDUCED BANK EROSION, FLOC DEPOSITION, AND CONSOLIDATION OF THE BED. COUPLED TO A DISTRIBUTED HYDROLOGICAL MODEL, SEDIMENT TRANSPORT WAS SIMULATED IN A 5.2 HA FORESTRY-DRAINED PEATLAND CATCHMENT FOR 2 YEARS AFTER DITCH CLEANING. COMPARING SIMULATION RESULTS TO MEASURED SS CONCENTRATIONS SUGGESTED THAT THE LOOSE PEAT MATERIAL, PRODUCED DURING EXCAVATION, CONTRIBUTED MARKEDLY TO ELEVATED SS CONCENTRATIONS IMMEDIATELY AFTER DITCH CLEANING.

CLIMATIC EFFECTS ALSO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE, PARTICULARLY DRYING-REWETTING CYCLES AND PERIODS OF EXTENDED DROUGHT. TO PREVENT NEGATIVE IMPACTS, PHASED FELLING AND LESS INTENSIVE FOREST HARVESTING TECHNIQUES SHOULD BE EMPLOYED.

RESOURCE EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES ARE CURRENTLY HAVING PROFOUND EFFECTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN SUB-ARCTIC PEATLANDS. IN WETLAND-DOMINATED ZONES OF DISCONTINUOUS PERMAFROST, PERMAFROST OCCURS BELOW TREE-COVERED PEAT PLATEAUS WHERE THE TREE-CANOPY AND VADOSE ZONE ACT TO INSULATE AND PRESERVE PERMAFROST BELOW. LINEAR DISTURBANCES SUCH AS SEISMIC LINES RESULT IN REMOVAL OF THE CANOPY, AND CAUSE PERMAFROST THAW, WHICH RESULTS IN INCREASED SOIL MOISTURE, LAND SUBSIDENCE, AND DEFORESTATION. THIS CONTRIBUTES TO LAND-COVER TRANSFORMATION, HABITAT AND VEGETATION LOSS, AND CHANGES TO BASIN HYDROLOGIC CYCLES. THE RESULTANT PERMAFROST-DEGRADED CORRIDORS COMPRISE LARGE PORTIONS OF THE DRAINAGE DENSITY OF SUB-ARCTIC BASINS, AND ALTER THE REGION'S WATER AND ENERGY BALANCES. MULCHING OVER DISTURBANCES, WITH THE REMOVED TREE CANOPY, HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS A BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE TO HELP REDUCE THIS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. HERE WE PRESENT CLIMATE CHAMBER AND NUMERICAL MODELING RESULTS WHICH QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF MULCHING AND ITS ABILITY TO LIMIT PERMAFROST THAW AND ALTERATIONS TO THE GROUND THERMAL REGIME. OVERALL, THE THERMAL BUFFERING ABILITY OF THE MULCH HAD BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON SLOWING THAW, DUE TO ITS LOW THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY, WHICH DECOUPLES THE SUBSURFACE FROM METEOROLOGICAL FORCING AND IMPEDES HEAT CONDUCTION. RESULTS INDICATE THAT MULCHING IS AN EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE TO REDUCE PERMAFROST THAW AND PROVIDES A SCIENTIFIC BASIS TO ASSESS THE MITIGATION MEASURE ON ITS ABILITY TO SLOW PERMAFROST DEGRADATION.

THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO ASSESS THE INTENSITY OF PEAT ACCUMULATION AND THE DEGREE OF TRANSFORMATION OF PEAT DEPOSITS WITHIN THE DRAINED RAISED BOGS THE SOUTH-EASTERN PART OF WEST SIBERIA BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND BOTANICAL COMPOSITION OF PEAT. THE OBJECTS UNDER STUDY ARE 8 KEY SITES IN DRAINED AND SIMILAR NATURAL PINE-SHRUB-SPHAGNUM RAISED BOG. THE SPECIES COMPOSITION IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE DOMINANCE OF PINUS SYLVESTRIS, LEDUM PALUSTRE, CHAMAEDAPHNE CALCULATA AND SPHAGNUM MOSSES. THE AREA UNDER STUDY WERE DRAINED IN 1980 BY A NETWORK OF OPEN CHANNELS FOR THE PURPOSE OF FOREST MELIORATION AND PEAT EXTRACTION. THE LACK OF PLANTING AND REPAIR OF THE DRAINAGE NETWORK HAS LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SELF-RECOVERY PROCESSES IN DRAINED MIRES. FIELD STUDIES OF THE SITES INCLUDED THE ACCESS OF PEAT DEPOSIT DEPTHS, SELECTING STRATIGRAPHIC LAYER BY TYPE AND DEGREE OF DECOMPOSITION OF PEAT BY VISUAL METHOD; SAMPLING PEAT IN STEPS OF 5 CM TO A DEPTH OF 90 CM USING A RUSSIAN PEAT CORER. LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF PEAT INCLUDED DETERMINATION OF THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS: BOTANICAL COMPOSITION, DEGREE OF DECOMPOSITION, ASH CONTENT, WATER CONTENT, BULK DENSITY. WE TAKE ANALYZED A TOTAL OF 162 PEAT SAMPLES. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DIFFERENCES IN THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF PEAT IN DRAINED AND NATURAL BOGS WAS ASSESSED USING THE MANN-WHITNEY TEST (U-TEST). CLASSIFICATION OF SITES BY CRITERIA OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF PEAT WAS PERFORMED BY CLUSTER ANALYSIS. THE CONSEQUENCES OF DRAINAGE ARE MANIFESTED IN A CHANGE IN THE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF MOSSES AND AN INCREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF WOOD RESIDUES IN THE PEAT DEPOSIT UPPER LAYER. ON TWO SITES, THE CHANGE OF BALTICUM AND MAGELLANICUM PEAT TO FUSCUM PEAT AT A DEPTH OF 25 CM WAS NOTED. THE OTHER SITE IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE APPEARANCE OF UPPER LAYER OF GREEN MOSSES IN THE PEAT COMPOSITION WITH A MAXIMUM SHARE OF THEIR PRESENCE AT A DEPTH OF 15-20 CM. TWO SITES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THE FORMATION OF WOOD PEAT IN THE UPPER LAYER, WITH ALMOST COMPLETE ABSENCE OF SPHAGNUM MOSS RESIDUES HERE, WHICH CAN BE AN INDICATOR OF THE ALMOST COMPLETE ABSENCE OF THE PROCESS OF PEAT DEPOSITS MODERN ACCUMULATION. AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY, IT IS SHOWN THAT THE BULK DENSITY OF PEAT CHARACTERIZES THE RATE OF ACCUMULATION OF PEAT AND IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE ASH CONTENT AND THE DEGREE OF DECOMPOSITION. THE INCREASE IN DENSITY IN THE PEAT LAYER AT DEPTHS UP TO 25 CM CORRESPONDS TO THE PERIOD OF PEAT ACCUMULATION DURING THE MAXIMUM EFFECT OF DRAINAGE. THE CHANGE IN ASH CONTENT WITH DEPTH AND A MAXIMUM VALUE IN THE LAYER OF 15-35 CM IS AN INDICATOR OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE PEAT LAYER LOCATED ON THE SURFACE DURING THE FIRST YEARS AFTER DRAINAGE, AND IS GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE LAWS OF BULK DENSITY CHANGES IN DEPTH. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE PEAT LAYER FORMED AFTER DRAINAGE RECLAMATION CHANGES FROM 0 TO 25-30 CM IN DIFFERENT KEY SITES. IN 6 OF THE 8 STUDIED SITES, THE PROCESS OF MODERN PEAT ACCUMULATION IS OBSERVED; IN TWO SITES, THE RATE OF PEAT ACCUMULATION IS MINIMAL OR COMPLETELY ABSENT.","ESTIMATION OF THE RAISED BOGS PEAT DEPOSIT TRANSFORMATION OF WEST SIBERIA SOUTH-EASTERN PART","GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH","ARTICLE","MAR",2020,"10.17223/25421379/14/6","GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000537749000008"

HOWEVER, PERTURBATIONS SUCH AS DRAINAGE INCREASE PEAT OXIDATION, WHICH MAY LEAD TO ENHANCED GASEOUS RELEASE OF CARBON. FOR THIS REASON, THE NUMBER OF RESTORATION PROJECTS THAT AIM TO REWET BLANKET BOGS HAS INCREASED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, BUT THERE IS STILL A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF RESTORATION ON EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES, SUCH AS METHANE, PARTICULARLY IN SITES RESTORED FROM FORESTRY. IN THIS PAPER, WE INVESTIGATE THE SEASONAL GREENHOUSE GAS DYNAMICS IN A FOREST-TO-BOG RESTORATION SITE IN SCOTLAND. WE ANALYSE THE EFFECTS OF RESTORATION ON BOTH CARBON DIOXIDE AND METHANE FLUXES, AND INVESTIGATE WHICH SITE FACTORS (MICROTOPOGRAPHY, VEGETATION TYPE, SOIL MOISTURE AND TEMPERATURE) DRIVE THE PROCESSES OF GASEOUS EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE BOG SURFACE AND THE ATMOSPHERE. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ORIGINAL SURFACE IS NEAR GREENHOUSE GASE EQUILIBRIUM AT -0.28 GCO(2)EQ M(2)CENTER DOT DAY(-1) AND THAT MICROTOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES ACT AS A NET GREENHOUSE GAS SINK (RIDGES = -0.94 GCO(2)EQ M(2)CENTER DOT DAY(-1) AND FURROWS = -0.86 GCO(2)EQ M(2)CENTER DOT DAY(-1)), WHEREAS THE BOG POOL IS A NET SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GASES (0.98 GCO(2)EQ M(2)CENTER DOT DAY(-1)). WE FOUND DIFFERENT VEGETATION SPECIES PLAY A KEY ROLE IN GREENHOUSE GAS FLUX DYNAMICS, ESPECIALLY IN FORESTRY-DERIVED MICROTOPOGRAPHICAL FEATURES, AND THEIR PRESENCE AND INFLUENCE ON GREENHOUSE GAS DYNAMICS SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR TO PROVIDE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH RESTORATION MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. HIGHLIGHTS GHG (CO2 AND CH4) DYNAMICS IN A BOREAL PEATLAND RESTORED FROM FORESTRY ARE MAINLY AFFECTED BY MICROTOPOGRAPHY AND VEGETATION. FORESTRY-DERIVED MICROFORMS (RIDGES AND FURROWS) ARE BETTER GHG SINKS THAN POOLS (GHG EMITTERS) AND ORIGINAL SURFACES (NEAR GHG EQUILIBRIUM). THE PRESENCE OF TRICHOPHORUM CESPITOSUM LEADS TO HIGHER CH4 EMISSIONS. RESTORATION PRACTICES LIKE TERRAFORMING MAY CREATE A SHORT-TERM PULSE NET GHG EMISSION DUE TO AN INCREASE OF BOTH CH4 AND CO2 FLUXES.","SEASONAL PATTERNS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM A FOREST-TO-BOG RESTORED SITE IN NORTHERN SCOTLAND: INFLUENCE OF MICROTOPOGRAPHY AND VEGETATION ON CARBON DIOXIDE AND METHANE DYNAMICS","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE","ARTICLE","MAY",2021,"10.1111/ejss.13050","SOIL SCIENCE","WOS:000586041400001"

WE CONDUCTED A PARTIAL HARVEST BY REMOVING 70% OF THE TOTAL STEM VOLUME IN A MATURE NUTRIENT-RICH PEATLAND FOREST IN SOUTHERN FINLAND. THE AIM WAS TO INVESTIGATE HOW PARTIAL HARVESTING A PEATLAND FOREST AFFECTS CH4 AND N2O BALANCES, AND HOW MUCH DIFFERENT SURFACE TYPES CONTRIBUTE TO THE BALANCES. WE USED AUTOMATIC AND MANUAL CHAMBER METHODS TO MEASURE FLUXES FROM BOTH HARVEST AND UNCUT CONTROL SITE. FLUXES WERE MEASURED FROM THE FOREST FLOOR, LOGGING TRAILS, AND DITCHES. FLUXES FROM THESE SURFACE TYPES WERE UPSCALED TO OBTAIN NET ECOSYSTEM-LEVEL FLUXES DURING TWO POSTHARVEST SUMMERS (JUNE-AUGUST 2016 AND 2017). AFTER THE HARVEST, FOREST FLOOR CH4 FLUXES DID NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY AT THE HARVESTED SITE COMPARED TO THE CONTROL SITE. HOWEVER, FLUXES AT LOGGING TRAILS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. N2O FLUXES INCREASED AT THE HARVEST SITE IN THE POST-HARVEST YEARS, BUT SO DID THOSE AT THE CONTROL SITE AS WELL. UPSCALING CH4 FLUXES TO ECOSYSTEM-LEVEL INDICATED THAT DESPITE THEIR SMALL AREA (2.4%), EMISSIONS FROM DITCHES COULD BE LARGE ON ECOSYSTEM-SCALE, BUT THEIR UNCERTAINTY WAS HIGH, WHILE THE LOGGING TRAIL CH4 FLUXES (20% OF THE TOTAL AREA) WERE SMALL.

REWETTING AIMS TO STOP THESE LOSSES AND TO RESTORE THE INITIAL STORAGE FUNCTION OF THE PEATLANDS. AS ROOTS REPRESENT MAJOR PEAT-FORMING ELEMENTS IN THESE SYSTEMS, WE SAMPLED ROOTS WITH DIAMETER <5 MM IN A DRAINED AND A REWETTED FOREST PEATLAND IN NORTH-EAST GERMANY TO EVALUATE DIFFERENCES IN TREE BIOMASS INVESTMENTS BELOW GROUND, ROOT FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND ROOT AGE. METHODS WE CORED SOIL NEXT TO ALNUS GLUTINOSA STEMS AND SORTED ROOT BIOMASS INTO <1, 1-2 AND 2-5 MM DIAMETER CLASSES. WE MEASURED BIOMASS DISTRIBUTION AND SPECIFIC ROOT AREA (SRA) IN 10-CM DEPTH INCREMENTS DOWN TO 50 CM, AND ESTIMATED ROOT AGE FROM ANNUAL GROWTH RINGS. KEY RESULTS ROOT BIOMASS IN THE REWETTED SITE WAS MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT IN THE DRAINED SITE. THIS DIFFERENCE WAS MOSTLY DRIVEN BY VERY FINE ROOTS <1 MM, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR 51 % OF THE TOTAL ROOT BIOMASS AND WERE MOSTLY (75 %) LOCATED IN THE UPPER 20 CM.

CHLORINE ACCUMULATES IN LARGE QUANTITIES (MORE THAN 50 %) IN PLANTS IN DRAINED SOIL, WHERE THE ROOTS ARE WELL SUPPLIED WITH OXYGEN.

SURVEYS OF GIBBON POPULATIONS HAVE RELIED MOSTLY ON MAPPING OF GROUPS IN ""LISTENING AREAS"" USING ACOUSTICAL POINT-COUNT DATA. TRADITIONAL METHODS OF ESTIMATING DENSITY IN HAVE USUALLY USED COUNTS OF GIBBON GROUPS WITHIN FIXED-RADIUS AREAS OR AREAS BOUNDED BY TERRAIN BARRIERS TO SOUND TRANSMISSION, AND HAVE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR POSSIBLE DECLINE IN DETECTABILITY WITH DISTANCE. IN THIS STUDY WE SAMPLED THE EASTERN HOOLOCK GIBBON (HOOLOCK LEUCOGENYS) POPULATION IN HTAMANTHI WILDLIFE SANCTUARY (WS), MYANMAR, USING TWO METHODS: THE TRADITIONAL POINT-COUNT METHOD WITH FIXED-RADIUS LISTENING AREAS, AND A NEWER METHOD USING POINT-TRANSECT DISTANCE ANALYSIS FROM A SAMPLE POINT ESTABLISHED IN THE CENTER OF EACH LISTENING POINT ARRAY. THE BASIC DATA WERE OBTAINED BY TRIANGULATING ON SINGING GROUPS FROM FOUR LPS FOR 4 DAYS, IN 10 RANDOMLY SELECTED SAMPLE AREAS WITHIN THE SANCTUARY. THE POINT TRANSECT METHOD GAVE AN AVERAGE DENSITY OF 3.13 GROUPS KM(-2), HIGHER THAN THE ESTIMATES OF GROUP DENSITY WITHIN FIXED-RADIUS AREAS WITHOUT CORRECTION FOR DETECTABILITY. A NEW METHOD OF ANALYSIS OF SINGING PROBABILITY PER DAY (P[1]) GAVE AN ESTIMATE OF 0.547. HTAMANTHI WS IS AN IMPORTANT CONSERVATION AREA CONTAINING AN ESTIMATED 7000 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: 5000-10,000) HOOLOCK GROUPS. SURVEYS AT HTAMANTHI WS AND LOCATIONS IN THE HUKAUNG VALLEY SUGGEST THAT THE EXTENSIVE EVERGREEN FORESTS IN NORTHERN MYANMAR HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SUPPORT 2-4 (AVERAGE ABOUT 3) GROUPS OF HOOLOCK GIBBONS PER KM(2), BUT MOST FORESTS IN ITS RANGE HAVE YET TO BE SURVEYED.","COMPARISON OF POINT TRANSECT DISTANCE AND TRADITIONAL ACOUSTIC POINT-COUNT SAMPLING OF HOOLOCK GIBBONS IN HTAMANTHI WILDLIFE SANCTUARY, MYANMAR","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY","ARTICLE","DEC",2020,"10.1002/ajp.23198","ZOOLOGY","WOS:000573138000001"

HYDROLOGICAL FOREST RECLAMATION SYSTEMS IN CONIFEROUS BOREAL FORESTS IMPLY THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT REGIME INCLUDING SILVICULTURAL TENDING AND PARTIAL LOGGING. SPECTRUM BROADENING OF PRODUCTS OBTAINED IN FOREST LAND EXPLOITATION SHOULD BE ACHIEVED BY THE MEANS OF LIFETIME AND MINOR USE. PRODUCTION OF PINE TURPENTINE (SAP) ALLOWS TO OBTAIN VALUABLE FOREST CHEMICAL RAW MATERIALS FOR THE NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES. INFLUENCE OF FOREST DRAINAGE AND PARTIAL LOGGING ON RESIN PRODUCTIVITY IS ONE OF THE INSUFFICIENTLY PROVIDED RESEARCH ISSUES IN FORESTRY. ON THE EXAMPLE OF SOKOL'SKIY DISTRICT OF VOLOGDA REGION, THE INFLUENCE OF LOCATION OF PINE TREES (TOWARDS THE CHANNELS OF REGULATING NETWORK AND FOREST BELTS), LEFT FOR COMPLETION OF GROWING AFTER PARTIAL LOGGING, ON THE PINE SAP EXUDATION UNDER CLOSED TAPPING WAS STUDIED. IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT THE DRAINAGE SYSTEM CHANNELS IN THE FELLING SITE AREA WERE IN SATISFACTORY CONDITION FROM 1972 TILL 2015. THE HIGHEST RESIN PRODUCTIVITY OF PINE FORESTS WAS OBSERVED IN JULY AND THE LOWEST IN AUGUST. ONE OF THE FOREST BELTS HAD THE HIGHEST RESIN PRODUCTIVITY IN THE CENTER AND AT THE EDGE OF THE SWATH IN 2013 AND 2015; AND IN THE CHANNEL AREA IN 2013 AND 2014. RESIN PRODUCTIVITY AT THE FELLING SITE IS 1.4 TIMES HIGHER THAN IN THE CONTROL AREA (UNDER THE DRAINAGE CONDITIONS). THIS PROVES THE POSITIVE EFFECT FROM SELECTIVE TREE CUTTING IN LOGGING FOR RESIN EXUDATION FROM THE PART OF TREES REMAINED AFTER TAPPING. THREE YEARS OF STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE VARIABILITY OF RESIN EXUDATION AT THE EDGE OF THE SWATH IS 9 % LESS THAN IN THE CENTER OF THE SWATH. NO APPARENT FLUCTUATIONS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE CHANNEL AND INTERCHANNEL AREAS OF THE DRAINED BELT. THE STUDY HAS PROVED THAT SOIL AND AIR TEMPERATURE, AND VALUATION DIAMETER OF SAMPLE TREES INVOLVED INTO TAPPING CAN AFFECT THE RESIN EXUDATION. A SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WITH THE TEMPERATURE OF UNDERLYING SURFACE WAS REGISTERED IN JULY AND AUGUST AND WITH THE SOIL TEMPERATURE IN JULY. THE AIR TEMPERATURE AT THE LEVEL OF RESIN BLAZE LOCATION OF THE SAMPLE TREES AFFECTS THE RESIN EXUDATION MOSTLY IN JUNE. IT TURNED OUT THAT THE CORRELATION BETWEEN RESIN EXUDATION AND VALUATION DIAMETER OF TREES IS STRONGER IN THE CHANNEL AREA AND AT THE EDGE OF SWATH THAN IN THE CENTER OF INTERCHANNEL AREA. PROBABLY, IT DEPENDS ON THE MICROCLIMATE AND HYDROLOGICAL FEATURES AFTER DRAINING AND PARTIAL LOGGING THAT RESULTS IN MORE COMFORTABLE CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH (HIGHER ILLUMINATION). THE TURPENTINE PRODUCTION IN DRAINED PINE FORESTS REQUIRES CARRYING OUT PARTIAL CUTTINGS OF MODERATE INTENSITY BY RESERVES AND INTENSIVE TAPPING AT THE EDGES OF BELTS (LOGGING AREA) LEFT FOR COMPLETION OF GROWING. IN DRAINED PINE FORESTS ON PEAT SOILS, TAPPING WITH GREATER INTENSITY SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN THE CHANNEL AREAS (ALONG THE DRAINAGE CHANNELS).","RESIN PRODUCTIVITY OF PINE AFTER PARTIAL LOGGING ON THE HYDROTECHNICAL RECLAMATION SITE","LESNOY ZHURNAL-FORESTRY JOURNAL","ARTICLE",NA,2019,"10.17238/issn0536-1036.2019.2.67","FORESTRY","WOS:000467104700006"

"MOORE PD, 2002, ENVIRON CONSERV","MOORE PD","THE TEMPERATE PEATLANDS ARE EXTENSIVE, COVERING AROUND 3.5 MILLION KM(2) OF LAND. THEY CONTAIN ABOUT 455 GT OF CARBON, ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO THE CARBON STORED IN ALL OF THE LIVING THINGS ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET, AND REPRESENTING AROUND 25% OF ALL THE SOIL CARBON ON EARTH. THESE BOGS ARE A SINK FOR ATMOSPHERIC CARBON AND THEIR CARBON UPTAKE ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 12% OF CURRENT HUMAN EMISSIONS. THEY VARY CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR FORM AND STRUCTURE AND ARE AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, INCLUDING THE STUDY OF PAST ENVIRONMENTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THEY ARE ALSO VALUABLE IN ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION. THEY ARE LOW IN BIODIVERSITY, BUT THEIR FAUNA AND FLORA ARE DISTINCTIVE AND MANY GROUPS ARE CONFINED TO THIS HABITAT. FOR ALL THESE REASONS, THE FUTURE CONSERVATION OF PEATLANDS IS A MATTER FOR CONCERN. THREATS TO PEATLANDS COME FROM DIRECT HUMAN EXPLOITATION IN THE FORM OF PEAT HARVESTING FOR ENERGY AND HORTICULTURE, AND DRAINAGE FOR FORESTRY. RISING ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS SHOULD CONTROL BOTH OF THESE PROCESSES IN THE WESTERN WORLD, BUT CONTINUED NORTHERN PEATLAND LOSSES ARE LIKELY LOCALLY, ESPECIALLY IN ASIA. PEATLAND DRAINAGE FOR FORESTRY OR AGRICULTURE WILL RESULT IN LOSSES OF CARBON TO THE ATMOSPHERE, ADDING TO THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT. HUMAN POPULATION PRESSURES, INDUSTRIALIZATION AND URBANIZATION ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE INFLUENCE IN THE BOREAL ZONE. FRAGMENTATION OF THE HABITAT IS NOT AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION BECAUSE BOGS ARE BY THEIR VERY NATURE 'ISLAND' HABITATS. ACIDIFICATION BY AERIAL POLLUTION MAY BE A LOCAL PROBLEM CLOSE TO SOURCES, BUT THE HABITAT IS NATURALLY ACID AND SHOULD NOT BE SEVERELY AFFECTED, THE INPUT OF AERIAL NUTRIENTS, HOWEVER, PARTICULARLY NITROGEN, COULD HAVE WIDESPREAD IMPACT ON BOGS, ENHANCING THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND ALTERING THEIR VEGETATION COMPOSITION. THE PHYSICAL REHABILITATION OF BOGS DAMAGED BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES PRESENTS MANY PROBLEMS, PARTICULARLY RELATING TO THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF PEAT STRUCTURE AND VEGETATION, BUT THE PROCESS CAN RESULT IN THE RE-FORMATION OF A CARBON SINK SO IT IS WORTH THE EFFORT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN ITS IMPACT ON BOGS. HIGHER TEMPERATURE (ESPECIALLY IF ACCOMPANIED BY RAISED ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS AND INCREASED NITRATE DEPOSITION) WILL ENHANCE PRODUCTIVITY, BUT WILL ALSO RESULT IN FASTER DECOMPOSITION RATES. THE OUTCOME OF THESE OPPOSING FACTORS FOR PEAT FORMATION WILL ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON THE FUTURE PATTERN OF PRECIPITATION. IF, AS SEEMS MOST LIKELY, SUMMER CONDITIONS BECOME WARMER AND DRIER IN CONTINENTAL REGIONS AND WINTERS BECOME MILDER AND WETTER, THE SUMMER DROUGHT COULD CAUSE PEAT LOSS AND BOG CONTRACTION. AN EXCESS OF DECOMPOSITION WILL LEAD TO BOGS BECOMING A CARBON SOURCE AND THUS A POSITIVE FEEDBACK IN GLOBAL WARMING. EMISSIONS OF METHANE AND NITROUS OXIDE WOULD ADD TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS PROBLEM, BUT LIKELY OXIDATION OF METHANE AND LOW N(2)O PRODUCTION MAY WELL MEAN THAT THIS IMPACT WILL NOT PROVE TO BE SIGNIFICANT. TREE INVASION OF BOGS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUMMER DROUGHT COULD LOCALLY LEAD TO INCREASED WATER LOSS THROUGH TRANSPIRATION, AND HIGHER HEAT ABSORPTION THROUGH ALBEDO CHANGE. THIS WILL ENHANCE THE DRYING EFFECT ON THE BOG SURFACE. OCEANIC MIRES WILL BE LESS SEVERELY AFFECTED IF THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN PRECIPITATION TAKES PLACE IN THESE REGIONS.

A RECENT MANAGEMENT TREND FOR DRAINED PEATLANDS IS THE CONTROL OF GREENHOUSE GASES (GHG) BY CHANGES IN AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES, PEATLAND RESTORATION OR PALUDICULTURE. DUE TO COMPLEX ANTAGONISTIC CONTROLS OF MOISTURE, WATER TABLE MANAGEMENT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO USE AS A METHOD FOR CONTROLLING GHG EMISSIONS. PAST STUDIES SHOW THAT THERE IS NO OBVIOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GHG EMISSION RATES AND CROP TYPE, TILLAGE INTENSITY OR FERTILIZATION RATES. FOR DRAINED PEAT SOILS, THE BEST USE OPTIONS CAN VARY FROM REWETTING WITH REDUCED EMISSION TO EFFICIENT SHORT TERM USE TO MAXIMIZE THE, PROFIT PER AMOUNT OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMITTED. THE GHG ACCOUNTING SHOULD CONSIDER THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE OF THE PEATLAND AND THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC BENEFITS PEATLANDS PROVIDE LOCALLY. CULTIVATING ENERGY CROPS IS A VIABLE OPTION ESPECIALLY FOR WET PEAT SOILS WITH POOR DRAINAGE, BUT HARVESTING REMAINS A CHALLENGE DUE TO TRACTABILITY OF WET SOILS. PALUDICULTURE IN LOWLAND FLOODPLAINS CAN BE A TOOL TO MITIGATE REGIONAL FLOODING ALLOWING WATER TO BE STORED ON THESE LANDS WITHOUT MUCH HARM TO CROPS. THIS CAN ALSO INCREASE REGIONAL BIODIVERSITY PROVIDING IMPORTANT HABITATS FOR BIRDS AND MOISTURE TOLERANT PLANT SPECIES. HOWEVER, ON MANY PEATLANDS REWETTING IS NOT POSSIBLE DUE TO THEIR POSITION IN THE LANDSCAPE AND THE ASSOCIATED DIFFICULTY TO MAINTAIN A HIGH STABLE WATER TABLE. WHILE THE GOAL OF REWETTING OFTEN IS TO ENCOURAGE THE RETURN OF PEAT FORMING PLANTS AND THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THEY PROVIDE SUCH AS CARBON SEQUESTRATION, IT IS NOT WELL KNOWN IF THESE PLANTS WILL GROW ON PEAT SOILS THAT HAVE BEEN ALTERED BY THE PROCESS OF DRAINAGE AND MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER PEAT QUALITY AND HYDROLOGY WHEN CHOOSING MANAGEMENT OPTIONS. MAPPING OF SITES IS RECOMMENDED AS A MANAGEMENT TOOL TO GUIDE ACTIONS. THE ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THE SITES SHOULD BE ASSESSED BOTH FOR CONTINUED CULTIVATION BUT ALSO FOR OTHER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES SUCH AS RESTORATION AND HYDROLOGICAL FUNCTIONS (FLOOD CONTROL). FARMERS NEED ADVICE, TOOLS AND TRAINING TO FIND THE BEST AFTER-USE OPTION. BIOFUELS MIGHT PROVIDE A COST-EFFICIENT AFTER USE OPTION FOR SOME SITES. PEAT EXTRACTION FOLLOWED BY REWETTING MIGHT PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE OPTION AS REWETTING IS OFTEN EASIER IF THE PEAT IS REMOVED, STARTING THE PEAT ACCUMULATION FROM SCRATCH.

THE LARGEST OWLAND MIRES STARTED FORMING AFTER THE SEA RETREATED, AND MANY ARE NOT OLDER THAN CA. 3,000 YEARS. IN 1996, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF WETLANDS (INCLUDING PEAT-FORMING MIRES, FRESHWATER MARSHES, AND SALTMARSHES) GREATER THAN 1 HA WAS 150, WITH A TOTAL AREA OF 59,881 HA. IN 1928, WHEN MANY WETLANDS WERE YET UNDEVELOPED, THEIR TOTAL AREA WAS 200,642 HA. MOST LOSSES OCCURRED BETWEEN THE 1950S AND 1970S, WHEN POST-WAR DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS PROMOTED AGRICULTURE AND LARGE-SCALE RECLAMATION PROJECTS. CURRENTLY, 90.7% OF MOUNTAIN WETLANDS ARE PUBLIC LAND, WHILE 81.3% OF THE LOWLAND WETLANDS ARE PRIVATE OR IN MIXED OWNERSHIP. THE OWNERSHIP CONDITION AFFECTS THE POSSIBILITIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF COMPLETE MIRE COMPLEXES ESPECIALLY IN THE LOWLANDS. FOR EFFECTIVE CONSERVATION OF WETLAND ECOSYSTEMS IT IS NECESSARY TO INCLUDE THE CATCHMENT AREA IN THE PLANNING OF PROTECTED AREAS.","AN INVENTORY OF THE MIRES OF HOKKAIDO, JAPAN-THEIR DEVELOPMENT, CLASSIFICATION, DECLINE, AND CONSERVATION","PLANT ECOLOGY","REVIEW","JAN",2009,"10.1007/s11258-007-9267-z","PLANT SCIENCES; ECOLOGY; FORESTRY","WOS:000261412200002"

A REVIEW OF THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR THEIR CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT EXAMINES THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN THE WATER TABLE, THE IMPACT OF GRAZING LIVESTOCK AND CHANGES BROUGHT ABOUT BY NEIGHBOURING CONIFER PLANTATIONS. THESE RAISED AND BLANKET MIRES VARY IN SIZE FROM 0.6 TO 69.6 HA, AND ARE DOMINATED BY OMBROTROPHIC VEGETATION. THEIR MAIN CONSERVATION VALUE LIES IN THEIR 'NATURALNESS', WHICH ARISES FROM THE EXTENSIVE NATURE OF LOCALLY USED STOCK GRAZING SYSTEMS AND THE INTRINSIC DIFFICULTY OF DRAINING MIRES THAT LIE IN DEPRESSIONS AND EXPERIENCE AN UPLAND CLIMATE. SUCH SITES ARE RARE AND CONTAIN UNCOMMON PLANTS AND INVERTEBRATES, WHILST COLLECTIVELY THESE MIRES EXHIBIT CONSIDERABLE TOPOGRAPHICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL VARIETY, A REVIEW OF THE HYDROLOGICAL EFFECTS OF CONIFER PLANTATIONS ON MIRE CATCHMENTS CONCLUDES THAT THE CATCHMENTS PROBABLY HAVE LITTLE, IF ANY, INFLUENCE ON THE MIRES THEMSELVES. MANAGEMENT OF WATER FLOW ON THE MIRES HAS THE OBJECTIVE OF REDUCING THE RATE OF DISCHARGE OF PRECIPITATION FROM THEM BY DAMMING AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY DRAINAGE CHANNELS. A REVIEW OF THE ROLE OF LIVESTOCK GRAZING CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS NO DIRECT EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THIS IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THE MIRE PLANT COMMUNITIES. CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT ITS IMPACT IS MINIMAL ON VEGETATION OVER DEEP PEAT, AND PROBABLY MOST INFLUENTIAL ON VEGETATION OVER SHALLOWER PEAT AT MIRE MARGINS.","THE BORDER MIRES IN KIELDER FOREST: A REVIEW OF THEIR ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","REVIEW","NOV",1995,"10.1016/0378-1127(95)03621-0","FORESTRY","WOS:A1995TL88400005"

COMMON IN PEAT SOILS ARE FIVE OF THE EIGHT DESCRIBED ORDERS OF METHANOGENS SPANNING THREE PHYLA (EURYARCHAEOTA, HALOBACTEROTA AND THERMOPLASMATOTA). THE PHYLOGENETIC AFFILIATION OF SEQUENCES FOUND IN PEAT SUGGEST THAT MEMBERS OF THE THUS-FAR-UNCULTIVATED GROUP CANDIDATUS BATHYARCHAEOTA (REPRESENTING A FOURTH PHYLUM) MAY BE INVOLVED IN METHANE CYCLING, EITHER ANAEROBIC OXIDATION OF METHANE AND/OR METHANOGENESIS, AS AT LEAST A FEW ORGANISMS WITHIN THIS GROUP CONTAIN THE ESSENTIAL GENE, MCRA, ACCORDING TO METAGENOMIC DATA.

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

DURING THE 20TH CENTURY SUBSTANTIAL AREAS OF NORTHERN PEATLANDS WERE DRAINED TO REPURPOSE THE LAND FOR INDUSTRIAL OR AGRICULTURAL USE. DRAINED PEATLANDS HAVE DYSFUNCTIONAL MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES, WHICH CAN LEAD TO NET CARBON EMISSIONS. REWETTING OF DRAINED PEATLANDS IS THEREFORE AN ENVIRONMENTAL PRIORITY, YET OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTS OF PEATLAND DRAINAGE AND REWETTING ON MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES IS STILL INCOMPLETE. HERE WE SUMMARIZE THE LAST DECADE OF RESEARCH INTO THE RESPONSE OF THE WIDER MICROBIAL COMMUNITY, METHANE-CYCLING MICROORGANISMS, AND MICRO-FAUNA TO DRAINAGE AND REWETTING IN FENS AND BOGS IN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA. EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON CURRENT RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES AND THEIR LIMITATIONS. WE PROPOSE TARGETS FOR FUTURE WORK INCLUDING: ACCOUNTING FOR TIMESCALE OF DRAINAGE AND REWETTING EVENTS; BETTER VERTICAL AND LATERAL COVERAGE OF SAMPLES ACROSS A PEATLAND; THE INTEGRATION OF PROTEOMIC AND METABOLOMIC DATASETS INTO FUNCTIONAL COMMUNITY ANALYSIS; THE USE OF RNA SEQUENCING TO DIFFERENTIATE THE ACTIVE COMMUNITY FROM LEGACY DNA; AND FURTHER STUDY INTO THE RESPONSE OF THE VIRAL AND MICRO-FAUNAL COMMUNITIES TO PEATLAND DRAINAGE AND REWETTING.

ALTHOUGH EROSION AND RUNOFF CAN CONTRIBUTE TO LOSS OF P, THE LARGE AMOUNT OF FERTILIZER APPLIED CAUSES A RAPID BUILD-UP OF THIS NUTRIENT, RESULTING IN THE DOWNWARD MOVEMENT OF EXCESS P IN THE SOIL PROFILE AND SUBSEQUENT LOSS THROUGH TILE DRAINAGE WATER. FOR ARABLE ORGANIC SOILS, THESE LOSSES OFTEN OCCUR THROUGH SUBSURFACE TILE DRAINS, A COMMON REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN A FAVORABLE AIR-WATER BALANCE IN THE CROP ROOT ZONE, AS WELL AS TO PREVENT SOIL SUBSIDENCE. AS SUCH, SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE IS A MAJOR PATHWAY FOR AGRICULTURAL P LOSS, CONTRIBUTING TO PERSISTENT EUTROPHICATION OF RIVERS, LAKES, AND ESTUARIES GLOBALLY. ALTHOUGH STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED ON P MITIGATION WITHIN ORGANIC SOILS, APPLICATION OF DRAINAGE WATER MANAGEMENT (DWM) AS A P MITIGATION STRATEGY IN THESE SOILS, HAS NOT BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ADDRESS THIS GAP IN KNOWLEDGE BY REVIEWING PREVIOUS STUDIES ON P LOSSES FROM SUBSURFACE DRAINED AGRICULTURAL ORGANIC SOILS WHILE EVALUATING POTENTIAL MITIGATION STRATEGIES. SPECIFICALLY, THIS PAPER ASSESSES THE UNIQUE PROPERTIES OF ORGANIC SOILS THAT COULD INFLUENCE P FATE AND TRANSPORT, SUCH AS THE DISTRIBUTION OF P POOLS WITHIN THE SOIL POOLS; VARIABLE PORE GEOMETRY, HYDROPHOBICITY, AND SHRINKAGE; P LOADS EXITING TILE DRAINS; AND DWM PRACTICES IN MITIGATING P LOSSES. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT P RETENTION IS AFFECTED BY THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF SOIL WATER MOVEMENT IN ORGANIC SOILS AND THAT SUBSTANTIAL P LOADS ENTER SURROUNDING WATER BODIES VIA SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE EFFLUENT. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT DWM IS AN EFFECTIVE BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE IN THE ABATEMENT OF SUBSURFACE P LOSSES.","PHOSPHORUS FATE, TRANSPORT AND MANAGEMENT ON SUBSURFACE DRAINED AGRICULTURAL ORGANIC SOILS: A REVIEW","ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS","REVIEW","JAN",2021,"10.1088/1748-9326/abce81","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; METEOROLOGY & ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES","WOS:000607308200001"

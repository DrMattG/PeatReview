THEY REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CARBON AND ENERGY RESERVOIR AND PLAY MAJOR ROLES IN WATER AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES. PEAT SOILS ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX POROUS MEDIA WITH DISTINCT CHARACTERISTIC PHYSICAL AND HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES. PORE SIZES IN UNDECOMPOSED PEAT CAN EXCEED 5 MM, BUT SIGNIFICANT SHRINKAGE OCCURS DURING DEWATERING, COMPRESSION AND DECOMPOSITION, REDUCING PORE-SIZES. THE STRUCTURE OF PEAT SOIL CONSISTS OF PORES THAT ARE OPEN AND CONNECTED, DEAD-ENDED OR ISOLATED. THE RESULTING DUAL-POROSITY NATURE OF PEAT SOILS AFFECTS WATER FLOW AND SOLUTE MIGRATION, WHICH INFLUENCE REACTIVE TRANSPORT PROCESSES AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL FUNCTIONS. ADVECTIVE MOVEMENT OF AQUEOUS AND COLLOIDAL SPECIES IS RESTRICTED TO THE HYDROLOGICALLY ACTIVE (OR MOBILE) FRACTION OF THE TOTAL POROSITY, I.E. THE OPEN AND CONNECTED PORES. PEAT MAY ATTENUATE SOLUTE MIGRATION THROUGH MOLECULAR DIFFUSION INTO THE CLOSED AND DEAD-END PORES, AND FOR REACTIVE SPECIES, ALSO THROUGH SORPTION AND DEGRADATION REACTIONS. SLOW, DIFFUSION-LIMITED SOLUTE EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE MOBILE AND IMMOBILE REGIONS MAY GIVE RISE TO PORE-SCALE CHEMICAL GRADIENTS AND HETEROGENEOUS DISTRIBUTIONS OF MICROBIAL HABITATS AND ACTIVITY IN PEAT SOILS. WHILE NEW INFORMATION ON THE DIVERSITY AND FUNCTIONALITIES OF PEAT MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES IS RAPIDLY ACCUMULATING, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE GEOCHEMICAL AND GEOMICROBIAL STUDY ON PEAT STANDS TO BENEFIT FROM A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF PEAT SOILS. IN THIS PAPER, WE REVIEW THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE OF KEY PHYSICAL AND HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES RELATED TO THE STRUCTURE OF GLOBALLY AVAILABLE PEAT SOILS AND BRIEFLY DISCUSS THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR WATER STORAGE, FLOW AND THE MIGRATION OF SOLUTES. THIS PAPER IS INTENDED TO NARROW THE GAP BETWEEN THE ECOHYDROLOGICAL AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL RESEARCH COMMUNITIES WORKING ON PEAT SOILS. (C) 2016 THE AUTHORS.

WE ANALYZED A UNIQUE DATA SET (12 PEATLANDS, 48 SITES AND 122 ANNUAL BUDGETS) OF MAINLY UNPUBLISHED GHG EMISSIONS FROM GRASSLANDS ON BOG AND FEN PEAT AS WELL AS OTHER SOILS RICH IN SOIL ORGANIC CARBON (SOC) IN GERMANY. EMISSIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES WERE MEASURED WITH IDENTICAL METHODS. SITE-AVERAGED GHG BUDGETS WERE SURPRISINGLY VARIABLE (29.2 +/- 17.4 T CO2-EQ. HA(-1)YR(-1)) AND PARTIALLY HIGHER THAN ALL PUBLISHED DATA AND THE IPCC DEFAULT EMISSION FACTORS FOR GHG INVENTORIES. GENERALLY, CO2 (27.7 +/- 17.3 T CO(2)HA(-1)YR(-1)) DOMINATED THE GHG BUDGET. NITROUS OXIDE (2.3 +/- 2.4KG N2O-N HA(-1)YR(-1)) AND METHANE EMISSIONS (30.8 +/- 69.8KG CH4-C HA(-1)YR(-1)) WERE LOWER THAN EXPECTED EXCEPT FOR CH4 EMISSIONS FROM NUTRIENT-POOR ACIDIC SITES. AT SINGLE PEATLANDS, CO2 EMISSIONS CLEARLY INCREASED WITH DEEPER MEAN WATER TABLE DEPTH (WTD), BUT THERE WAS NO GENERAL DEPENDENCY OF CO2 ON WTD FOR THE COMPLETE DATA SET. THUS, REGIONALIZATION OF CO2 EMISSIONS BY WTD ONLY WILL REMAIN UNCERTAIN. WTD DYNAMICS EXPLAINED SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PEATLANDS AS SITES WHICH BECAME VERY DRY DURING SUMMER SHOWED LOWER EMISSIONS. WE INTRODUCED THE AERATED NITROGEN STOCK (N-AIR) AS A VARIABLE COMBINING SOIL NITROGEN STOCKS WITH WTD. CO2 INCREASED WITH N-AIR ACROSS PEATLANDS. SOILS WITH COMPARATIVELY LOW SOC CONCENTRATIONS SHOWED AS HIGH CO2 EMISSIONS AS TRUE PEAT SOILS BECAUSE N-AIR WAS SIMILAR. N2O EMISSIONS WERE CONTROLLED BY THE WTD DYNAMICS AND THE NITROGEN CONTENT OF THE TOPSOIL. CH4 EMISSIONS CAN BE WELL DESCRIBED BY WTD AND PONDING DURATION DURING SUMMER. OUR RESULTS CAN HELP BOTH TO IMPROVE GHG EMISSION REPORTING AND TO PRIORITIZE AND PLAN EMISSION REDUCTION MEASURES FOR PEAT AND SIMILAR SOILS AT DIFFERENT SCALES.","HIGH EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES FROM GRASSLANDS ON PEAT AND OTHER ORGANIC SOILS","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","ARTICLE","DEC",2016,"10.1111/gcb.13303","BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000387813300025"

HERE, WE EXPAND THE PAN-EUROPEAN DATASET FROM 128 TO 1799 SAMPLES, SPANNING 35 DEGREES OF LATITUDE AND 55 DEGREES OF LONGITUDE. AFTER THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW TAXONOMIC SCHEME TO PERMIT COMPILATION OF DATA FROM A WIDE RANGE OF CONTRIBUTORS AND THE REMOVAL OF SAMPLES WITH HIGH PH VALUES, WE DEVELOPED ECOLOGICAL TRANSFER FUNCTIONS USING A RANGE OF MODEL TYPES AND A DATASET OF SIMILAR TO 1300 SAMPLES. WE RIGOROUSLY TESTED THE EFFICACY OF THESE MODELS USING BOTH STATISTICAL VALIDATION AND INDEPENDENT TEST SETS WITH ASSOCIATED INSTRUMENTAL DATA. MODEL PERFORMANCE MEASURED BY STATISTICAL INDICATORS WAS COMPARABLE TO OTHER PUBLISHED MODELS. COMPARISON TO TEST SETS SHOWED THAT TAXONOMIC RESOLUTION DID NOT IMPAIR MODEL PERFORMANCE AND THAT THE NEW PAN-EUROPEAN MODEL CAN THEREFORE BE USED AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR PALAEOHYDROLOGICAL RECONSTRUCTION. OUR RESULTS QUESTION THE EFFICACY OF RELYING ON STATISTICAL VALIDATION OF TRANSFER FUNCTIONS ALONE AND SUPPORT A MULTI-FACETED APPROACH TO THE ASSESSMENT OF NEW MODELS.

RAPID PERMAFROST THAW IS PRODUCING DISTINCT LANDSCAPE CHANGES IN THE TAIGA PLAINS OF THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES, CANADA. AS PERMAFROST BODIES UNDERLYING FORESTED PEAT PLATEAUS SHRINK, THE LANDSCAPE SLOWLY TRANSITIONS INTO UNFORESTED WETLANDS. THE EXPANSION OF WETLANDS HAS ENHANCED THE HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY OF MANY WATERSHEDS VIA NEW SURFACE AND NEAR-SURFACE FLOW PATHS, AND INCREASED STREAMFLOW HAS BEEN OBSERVED.

MEASURED CLIMATE DATA ARE FIRST USED TO DRIVE SURFACE ENERGY BALANCE SIMULATIONS FOR THE WETLAND AND PEAT PLATEAU. NEAR-SURFACE SOIL TEMPERATURES SIMULATED IN THE SURFACE ENERGY BALANCE MODEL ARE THEN APPLIED AS THE UPPER BOUNDARY CONDITION TO A THREE-DIMENSIONAL MODEL OF SUBSURFACE WATER FLOW AND COUPLED ENERGY TRANSPORT WITH FREEZE-THAW. SIMULATION RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT LATERAL HEAT TRANSFER, WHICH IS NOT CONSIDERED IN MANY PERMAFROST MODELS, CAN INFLUENCE PERMAFROST THAW RATES. FURTHERMORE, THE SIMULATIONS INDICATE THAT LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION ARISING FROM PERMAFROST THAW ACTS AS A POSITIVE FEEDBACK MECHANISM THAT INCREASES THE ENERGY ABSORBED AT THE LAND SURFACE AND PRODUCES ADDITIONAL PERMAFROST THAW. THE MODELING RESULTS ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT FLOW RATES IN LOCAL GROUNDWATER FLOW SYSTEMS MAY BE ENHANCED BY THE DEGRADATION OF ISOLATED PERMAFROST BODIES.","INFLUENCE OF VERTICAL AND LATERAL HEAT TRANSFER ON PERMAFROST THAW, PEATLAND LANDSCAPE TRANSITION, AND GROUNDWATER FLOW","WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH","ARTICLE","FEB",2016,"10.1002/2015WR018057","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; LIMNOLOGY; WATER RESOURCES","WOS:000373117300038"

WE USED A DUAL-ISOTOPE APPROACH WITHIN A NESTED EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN IN A BOREAL CATCHMENT IN THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS (BRUNTLAND BURN) TO QUANTIFY THE SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF EVAPORATION FRACTIONATION IN A PEATLAND DRAINAGE NETWORK AND ITS EFFECT ON STREAM WATER ISOTOPES. WE CONDUCTED SPATIALLY DISTRIBUTED WATER SAMPLING WITHIN THE SATURATED PEATLAND UNDER DIFFERENT WETNESS CONDITIONS. WE USED THE LC-EXCESSWHICH DESCRIBES THE OFFSET OF A WATER SAMPLE FROM THE LOCAL METEORIC WATER LINE IN THE DUAL-ISOTOPE SPACETO UNDERSTAND THE DEVELOPMENT OF KINETIC FRACTIONATION DURING RUNOFF IN A PEATLAND NETWORK. THE EVAPORATION FRACTIONATION SIGNAL CORRELATED POSITIVELY WITH THE POTENTIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION AND NEGATIVELY WITH THE DISCHARGE. THE VARIABILITY OF THE ISOTOPIC ENRICHMENT WITHIN THE PEATLAND DRAINAGE NETWORK WAS HIGHER WITH HIGHER POTENTIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION AND LOWER WITH HIGHER DISCHARGE. WE FOUND AN INCREASED EVAPORATION FRACTIONATION TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE PEATLAND, WHILE GROUNDWATER SEEPAGE FROM MINEROGENIC SOILS INFLUENCED THE ISOTOPIC SIGNAL AT THE EDGE OF THE PEATLAND. THE EVAPORATION SIGNAL WAS IMPRINTED ON THE STREAM WATER, AS THE DISCHARGE FROM A PEATLAND DOMINATED SUBCATCHMENT SHOWED A MORE INTENSE DEVIATION FROM THE LOCAL METEORIC WATER LINE THAN THE DISCHARGE FROM THE BRUNTLAND BURN. THE FINDINGS UNDERLINE THAT EVAPORATION FRACTIONATION WITHIN PEATLAND DRAINAGE NETWORKS AFFECTS THE ISOTOPIC SIGNAL OF HEADWATER CATCHMENTS, WHICH QUESTIONS THE COMMON ASSUMPTION IN HYDROLOGICAL MODELING THAT THE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF STREAM WATERS DID NOT UNDERGO FRACTIONATION PROCESSES.","EVAPORATION FRACTIONATION IN A PEATLAND DRAINAGE NETWORK AFFECTS STREAM WATER ISOTOPE COMPOSITION","WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH","ARTICLE","JAN",2017,"10.1002/2016WR019258","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; LIMNOLOGY; WATER RESOURCES","WOS:000394911200050"

THE INTENSIFICATION OF PERMAFROST THAW MAY ALTER THE SIZE DISTRIBUTION AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF ORGANO-FE-AL COLLOIDS IN LAKES AND RIVERS. WE USED A CONTINUUM OF SURFACE WATER BODIES, FROM PERMAFROST SUBSIDENCE, SMALL DEPRESSIONS AND THAW PONDS TO LARGE LAKES AND RIVERS THAT DRAIN THE WESTERN SIBERIA LOWLAND (WSL), TO ASSESS OC, MAJOR AND THE TRACE ELEMENT SIZE DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN THE 20-MU M, 5-MU M, 1.2-MU M, 0.45-MU M, 0.22-MU M, 0.025-MU M AND 1-KDA (SIMILAR TO 1.4 NM) SIZE FRACTIONS. THIS APPROACH ALLOWED US TO DISTINGUISH THE ORGANIC AND ORGANO-FERRIC COLLOIDS THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRANSPORT OF TRACE ELEMENTS IN SURFACE WATERS AND ADDRESS THEIR EVOLUTION DURING POSSIBLE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES. BOTH CONVENTIONALLY DISSOLVED (<0.22 MU M) AND LOW-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT (<1 KDA) FRACTIONS EXHIBITED AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE DECREASE IN DOC/FE IN THE LANDSCAPE CONTINUUM ""DEPRESSIONS AND PERMAFROST SUBSIDENCE -> THAW PONDS -> THERMOKARST LAKES -> STREAMS -> RIVERS"". THERMODYNAMIC MODELING AND ON-SITE SIZE SEPARATION SUGGESTED THAT A NUMBER OF TRACE ELEMENTS (TES), INCLUDING ALKALINE EARTH ELEMENTS AND SEVERAL MICRONUTRIENTS (ZN, BA, MN, AND NI), DECREASED THE DEGREE OF THEIR BINDING TO DOM ALONG THE LANDSCAPE CONTINUUM, WHEREAS THE MAJORITY OF INSOLUBLE TES (AL, FE, CO, CD, CU, PB, REES, TH, AND U) REMAINED COMPLEXED WITH DOM IN THE LMW<1 KDA FRACTION. TWO PRIMARY SITES OF COLLOID GENERATION INCLUDED (I) GROUND VEGETATION AND PEAT LEACHING, WHICH SUPPLIED DOM COMPLEXES OF DIVALENT METALS AND ORGANO-AL ENTITIES TO THAW PONDS AND LAKES; AND (II) FE2+ OXIDATION AND TE CO-PRECIPITATION WITH FE HYDROXIDES IN THE PRESENCE OF SURFACE DOM AT GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE SITES WITHIN THE RIPARIAN/HYPORHEIC ZONES OF RIVERS. UNDER A WARMING CLIMATE SCENARIO, AN INCREASE IN THE THICKNESS OF THE THAWING DEPTH WILL INTENSIFY THE INPUT OF INORGANIC COMPONENTS FROM DEEP MINERAL HORIZONS AND POSSIBLY UNDERGROUND WATERS THUS PRODUCING THE ENRICHMENT OF LARGE LAKES IN FE-RICH COLLOIDS AND PARTICLES. THE SPECIATION OF DIVALENT METAL MICRONUTRIENTS (CU, NI, AND CO) AND TOXIC METALS (AL, CD, PB, AND U) THAT ARE COMPLEXED WITHIN DOM WILL MOST LIKELY REMAIN CONSERVATIVE. OVERALL, THE WSL'S SURFACE WATER COLLOIDAL COMPOSITION MAY SHIFT FROM DOM-RICH AND DOM-AL-RICH TO FE-RICH, AND THE EXPORT OF LOW-SOLUBLE TRIVALENT AND TETRAVALENT HYDROLYSATES FROM THE SOIL TO RIVERS WILL INCREASE.

WE AIM TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF REGIONAL CLIMATE AND AUTOGENIC PROCESSES OF THE RAISED BOG ITSELF IN DRIVING THE VEGETATION AND HYDROLOGY DYNAMICS. BASED ON PARTLY SYNCHRONOUS CHANGES IN SPHAGNUM COMMUNITIES IN THE TWO STUDY CORES WE SUGGEST THAT EXTRINSIC FACTORS (CLIMATE) PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE AS A DRIVER IN MIRE DEVELOPMENT DURING THE BOG STAGE (500-2012 CE). USING A TESTATE AMOEBAE TRANSFER FUNCTION, WE FOUND EXCEPTIONALLY STABLE HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS DURING THE LAST 2000 YEARS WITH A RELATIVELY HIGH WATER TABLE AND LACK OF LOCAL FIRE EVENTS THAT ALLOWED FOR RAPID PEAT ACCUMULATION (2.75 MM/YEAR) IN THE BOG. FURTHER, THE STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN PH AND COMMUNITY-WEIGHTED MEAN OF TESTATE AMOEBA TRAITS SUGGESTS THAT OTHER VARIABLES THAN WATER-TABLE DEPTH PLAY A ROLE IN DRIVING MICROBIAL PROPERTIES UNDER STABLE HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN HYDROLOGICAL DYNAMICS IN BOGS BETWEEN NW AND NE POLAND UNTIL CA 1500 CE, AFTER WHICH THE WATER TABLE RECONSTRUCTIONS SHOW MORE SIMILARITIES.

WE TESTED AND CORROBORATED THIS HYPOTHESIS USING FINE SPATIAL SCALE (<2X2M(2)) DATA FROM TWO 20 X 20 M(2) PLOTS AT MER BLEUE, A TEMPERATE BOG. FURTHERMORE, WE PARTITIONED THE SPATIAL VARIATION OF PLANT COMMUNITIES INTO PORTIONS EXPLAINED BY WTD AS WELL AS FINE-SCALE AND BROAD-SCALE SPATIAL STRUCTURES USING DISTANCE-BASED MORAN'S EIGENVECTOR MAPS. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT PLANT DISTRIBUTIONS ARE MORE STRONGLY RELATED TO WTD THAN TO MICROTOPOGRAPHY AND FOUND THAT THIS HYPOTHESIS WAS SUPPORTED IN ONLY ONE OF THE TWO SAMPLED PLOTS, SUGGESTING THAT THE FEEDBACKS AMONG WTD, VEGETATION AND MICROTOPOGRAPHY COULD BE DEPENDENT ON LOCATION WITHIN A BOG.

OPEN-PIT OIL SANDS MINING ACTIVITIES IN NORTHERN ALBERTA RESULT IN LARGE-SCALE REMOVAL OF THE SURFICIAL LANDSCAPE, WHICH COMPRISES MANY (SIMILAR TO 50%) PEATLANDS, APPROXIMATELY 90% OF WHICH ARE FENS WITH A WIDE RANGE OF PEAT THICKNESSES (<1 M TO SIMILAR TO 5 M). RECENTLY, THE CONCEPT OF PEATLAND CREATION WAS ADAPTED INTO THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. TWO EXPERIMENTAL FEN PEATLANDS HAVE NOW BEEN CONSTRUCTED ON POST-MINING LANDSCAPES IN ORDER TO TEST THE DESIGN IMPLICATIONS AND IMPLEMENTATION METHODS AND TO DEVELOP KNOWLEDGE TO ADVANCE THE CONCEPT. THESE TWO SYSTEMS WERE GUIDED BY DIFFERENT CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES: ONE UTILIZED NUMERICAL MODELLING FOR LANDSCAPE OPTIMIZATION, WHILE THE OTHER ATTEMPTED TO MIMIC THE LANDSCAPE POSITION OF NATURAL FEN SYSTEMS (AND SUPPORTED THE DESIGN WITH NUMERICAL MODELLING). BOTH SYSTEM DESIGNS ATTEMPT TO ACCELERATE SUCCESSION BY ADDING PEAT SUBSTRATE (0.5 M AND 2 M) AND REVEGETATING, WITH THE BELIEF THAT THE SYSTEM WILL STABILIZE WITHIN DECADES AS OPPOSED TO MILLENNIA. THIS PAPER PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE FEASIBILITY OF PEATLAND CREATION, FROM A PRIMARILY HYDROLOGIC PERSPECTIVE, AND ADDRESSES THE COMPLEXITY OF DETERMINING WHETHER THESE PROJECTS CAN BE DEEMED A SUCCESS. FUTURE LANDSCAPE DESIGN PLANS COULD BENEFIT FROM A CHANGE OF PERCEPTION OF THE ROLE OF PEATLANDS IN THE LANDSCAPE. THIS CHANGE SHOULD INVOLVE A SHIFT AWAY FROM VIEWING WETLANDS AS LANDFORMS CONSTRAINED TO LOW-LYING AREAS WITHIN THE RECLAIMED LANDSCAPE, AND TOWARDS RECOGNIZING THAT PEATLANDS CAN FUNCTION AS BOTH A SINK AND SOURCE OF WATER TO THE REMAINDER OF THE CATCHMENT. WETLAND INTERCONNECTIVITY WITHIN THE RECONSTRUCTED LANDSCAPE COULD INCREASE WATER DETENTION AND STORAGE DURING WET PERIODS, WHICH WOULD BENEFIT BOTH THE WETLANDS AND THE FORESTLANDS DURING DRY PERIODS. THE ASSESSMENT OF THE SUCCESS OF THESE CONSTRUCTED SYSTEMS SHOULD BE A REFLECTION OF OUR ABILITY TO CORRECTLY AND ACCURATELY PREDICT THE INFLUENCE OF EXTERNAL FORCINGS (E.G., CLIMATE) ON THE PROCESSES OPERATING WITHIN A NEWLY CONSTRUCTED SYSTEM. SHORT TIMEFRAMES (SIMILAR TO 5 YEARS) ARE SUFFICIENT TO CHARACTERIZE A RANGE OF PROCESSES OPERATING IN THE CONSTRUCTED ECOSYSTEMS; HOWEVER, LONGER TIME PERIODS WILL REDUCE UNCERTAINTY IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE SYSTEM'S SUCCESSIONAL PATHWAY. THE DESIGN OF FUTURE CONSTRUCTED FEN PEATLANDS MUST EMPLOY AN ADAPTIVE APPROACH THAT ASSIMILATES THE KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPED IN THE CURRENT RESEARCH AND THE INFORMATION ATTAINED OVER THE LONGER-TERM TO GUIDE THE DESIGN OF FUTURE FEN SYSTEMS.

WE USED A FULLY INTEGRATED SURFACE-SUBSURFACE HYDROLOGICAL SIMULATOR TO ENHANCE GROUNDWATER-RELATED PROCESS UNDERSTANDING IN A HEADWATER CATCHMENT WITH A RICH BACKGROUND IN EMPIRICAL DATA. TO SET UP THE MODEL WE USED MINIMAL DATA THAT COULD BE REASONABLY EXPECTED TO EXIST FOR ANY EXPERIMENTAL CATCHMENT. A NOVEL ASPECT OF OUR APPROACH WAS IN USING SIMPLIFIED MODEL PARAMETERISATION AND INCLUDING PARAMETERS FROM ALL MODEL DOMAINS (SURFACE, SUBSURFACE, EVAPOTRANSPIRATION) IN AUTOMATED MODEL CALIBRATION. CALIBRATION AIMED NOT ONLY TO IMPROVE MODEL FIT, BUT ALSO TO TEST THE INFORMATION CONTENT OF THE OBSERVATIONS (STREAMFLOW, REMOTELY SENSED EVAPOTRANSPIRATION, MEDIAN GROUNDWATER LEVEL) USED IN CALIBRATION OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS. WE IDENTIFIED SENSITIVE PARAMETERS IN ALL MODEL DOMAINS (SUBSURFACE, SURFACE, EVAPOTRANSPIRATION), DEMONSTRATING THAT MODEL CALIBRATION SHOULD BE INCLUSIVE OF PARAMETERS FROM THESE DIFFERENT MODEL DOMAINS. INCORPORATING GROUNDWATER DATA IN CALIBRATION OBJECTIVES IMPROVED THE MODEL FIT FOR GROUNDWATER LEVELS, BUT SIMULATIONS DID NOT REPRODUCE WELL THE REMOTELY SENSED EVAPOTRANSPIRATION TIME SERIES EVEN AFTER CALIBRATION. SPATIALLY EXPLICIT MODEL OUTPUT IMPROVED OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW GROUNDWATER FUNCTIONS IN MAINTAINING STREAMFLOW GENERATION PRIMARILY VIA SATURATION EXCESS OVERLAND FLOW.

HERE WE INVESTIGATE THE CURRENT EXTENT OF DRYLANDS GLOBALLY, CONTINENTALLY AND NATIONALLY BY ANALYSING ONE OF THE MOST RECENT ARIDITY DATABASE (1950-2000 PERIOD) AND COMPARE STATISTICALLY, FOR THE FIRST TIME, WITH THE INITIAL DRYLAND ESTIMATIONS (1951-1980). USING DIACHRONIC ANALYSIS BETWEEN THE DATABASES, WE FOUND THAT DRYLANDS ARE CURRENTLY ALMOST 4% LARGER WORLDWIDE THAN EXPECTED AND COVER 45.4% OF THE EARTH'S LAND SURFACE. THIS NET INCREASE OF GLOBAL DRYLAND AREAS IS DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF ARID (+3.4%) AND SEMI-ARID (+0.9%) AREAS, WHILST HYPER-ARID ZONES DECREASED (-0.8%) AND DRY SUB-HUMID AREAS REMAINED STABLE.

BASED ON RELIABLE CALIBRATED AMS C-14 AGES, WE ESTABLISHED GRAIN SIZE VARIATIONS IN THE PEAT CORES SINCE 15.6 KA CAL. BP. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE PEATY SEDIMENTS IN THE CHANGBAI MOUNTAINS ARE MAINLY COMPOSED OF SILT. MOREOVER, THE GRAIN SIZE COMPONENT, WHICH IS RELATED TO PALEOCLIMATE VARIABLES, CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO THREE GROUPS BASED ON THE ""GRAIN SIZE CLASS VS. STANDARD DEVIATION"" METHOD. THESE SENSITIVE GRAIN SIZE COMPONENTS ARE < 37.0 MM (COMPONENT 1 OR C1), 37.0E497.8 MM (COMPONENT 2 OR C2) AND > 497.8 MM (COMPONENT 3 OR C3). C1 COMPRISES THE FINEST SILT IN THE PEATY SEDIMENT AND IS MAINLY CONVEYED BY THE EAST ASIAN WINTER MONSOON (EAWM), WHEREAS C2 IS TRANSPORTED INTO THE PEATLAND BY SURFACE RUNOFF RELATED TO THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE EAST ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON (EASM). C3 IS CONVEYED IN SALTATION AND BED-LOAD MODE BY STRONG SURFACE RUNOFF LINKED TO HIGH-ENERGY FLOW CAUSED BY A STRONG EASM, AND PERHAPS IS AN INDICATOR OF EXTREME RAINFALL EVENTS IN THE CHANGBAI MOUNTAINS.

WE FOUND THAT THE RESPONSE OF DOMINANT SPECIES HEIGHT TO THE FLOODING GRADIENT DEPENDS ON SPECIFIC SPECIES, I.E., A QUADRATIC RESPONSE FOR CAREX LASIOCARPA, A NEGATIVE CORRELATION FOR CALAMAGROSTIS ANGUSTIFOLIA, AND NO RESPONSE FOR CAREX APPENDICULATA. SPECIES RICHNESS SHOWED AN INTERMEDIATE EFFECT ALONG THE VEGETATION ZONE FROM MARSH TO WET MEADOW WHILE ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS INCREASED. WHEN THE COMMUNITIES WERE ANALYSED SEPARATELY, ONLY THE WATER TABLE DEPTH HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON SPECIES RICHNESS FOR TWO CAREX COMMUNITIES AND NO VARIABLE FOR C.

WHEN THE THREE ABOVEMENTIONED COMMUNITIES WERE GROUPED TOGETHER, VARIATIONS IN SPECIES RICHNESS WERE MAINLY DETERMINED BY COMMUNITY TYPE, WATER TABLE DEPTH AND COMMUNITY MEAN HEIGHT, WHILE VARIATIONS IN ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS WERE DRIVEN BY COMMUNITY TYPE AND THE HEIGHT OF DOMINANT SPECIES. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT IF HABITAT DRYING OF THESE HERBACEOUS WETLANDS IN THIS REGION CONTINUES, THEN TWO CAREX MARSHES WOULD BE REPLACED GRADUALLY BY C.

THREE SEDIMENT UNITS (SUS) CORRESPOND TO THE MAIN STAGES OF DEPOSITION (1) IN A THERMOKARST LAKE (SW : 4950 TO 3950 CAL YRS BP), (2) DURING TRANSITION FROM LACUSTRINE TO PALUSTRINE CONDITIONS AFTER LAKE DRAINAGE (SU2: 3950 TO 3120 CAL YRS BP), AND (3) IN PALUSTRINE CONDITIONS OF THE IWP FIELD THAT DEVELOPED AFTER DRAINAGE (SU3: 3120 CAL YRS BP TO 2012 CE). THE LACUSTRINE PHASE (PRE 3950 CAL YRS BP) IS CHARACTERIZED BY PLANKTONIC-BENTHIC AND PIONEER DIATOM SPECIES INDICATING CIRCUMNEUTRAL WATERS, AND VERY FEW PLANT MACROFOSSILS. THE POLLEN RECORD HAS CAPTURED A REGIONAL SIGNAL OF RELATIVELY STABLE VEGETATION COMPOSITION AND CLIMATE FOR THE LACUSTRINE STAGE OF THE RECORD UNTIL 3950 CAL YRS BP. PALUSTRINE CONDITIONS WITH BENTHIC AND ACIDOPHILIC DIATOM SPECIES CHARACTERIZE THE PEATY SHALLOW-WATER ENVIRONMENTS OF THE LOW-CENTERED IWP.

RESULTS PORTRAY THE COMMONLY OBSERVED DECREASE IN HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY WITH DEPTH, WHICH WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE REDUCTION OF PORE RADIUS AND INCREASE IN PORE TORTUOSITY. THE INCREASE IN PORE TORTUOSITY WITH DEPTH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE DECOMPOSED PEAT SOIL AND DECREASING PORE COORDINATION NUMBER WITH DEPTH, WHICH EXTENDED THE FLOW PATH OF FLUID PARTICLES.

SFW INCLUDES AN ACTIVE PUMPING SYSTEM, UPLAND HUMMOCKS, A FEN WETLAND AND UNDERDRAINS. TO EVALUATE THE INFLUENCE OF MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON THE HYDROLOGY OF THE SYSTEM, THIS STUDY REPORTS THE WATER BALANCE FROM JANUARY 2013 TO DECEMBER 2014, THE FIRST 2YEARS AFTER COMMISSIONING. A SEMI-DISTRIBUTED APPROACH WAS TAKEN TO EXAMINE THE FLUXES AND STORES OF WATER IN UPLANDS AND LOWLANDS.

WE EXPLORED A SET OF HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF MESOCLIMATE AIR AND LOCAL SPRING-WATER TEMPERATURE ON COMPOSITIONAL VARIATION OF AQUATIC (MACROINVERTEBRATES), SEMI-TERRESTRIAL (PLANTS) AND TERRESTRIAL (LAND SNAILS) COMPONENTS OF SPRING-FEN BIOTA, CATEGORIZED AS HABITAT SPECIALISTS AND OTHER SPECIES (I.E. MATRIX-DERIVED). WATER TEMPERATURE DID NOT SHOW A HIGH LEVEL OF CORRELATION WITH MESOCLIMATE. FOR ALL COMPONENTS, FRACTIONS OF COMPOSITIONAL VARIATION CONSTRAINED TO TEMPERATURE WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND HIGHER FOR HABITAT SPECIALISTS THAN FOR OTHER SPECIES. THE IMPORTANCE OF AIR TEMPERATURE AT THE EXPENSE OF WATER TEMPERATURE AND ITS FLUCTUATION CLEARLY INCREASED WITH TERRESTRIALITY, I.E. FROM AQUATIC MACROINVERTEBRATES VIA VEGETATION (BRYOPHYTES AND VASCULAR PLANTS) TO LAND SNAILS, WITH JANUARY AIR TEMPERATURE BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR LAND SNAILS AND PLANT SPECIALISTS. SOME CALCAREOUS-FEN SPECIALISTS WITH A CLEAR DISTRIBUTION CENTRE IN TEMPERATE EUROPE SHOWED A STRONG AFFINITY TO CLIMATICALLY COLD SITES IN OUR STUDY AREA AND MAY HENCE BE CONSIDERED AS THREATENED BY CLIMATE WARMING. WE CONCLUDE THAT PREDICTION MODELS SOLELY BASED ON AIR TEMPERATURE MAY PROVIDE BIASED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CHANGES IN SPRING FEN COMMUNITIES, BECAUSE THEIR AQUATIC AND SEMITERRESTRIAL COMPONENTS ARE LARGELY AFFECTED BY WATER TEMPERATURE THAT IS MODIFIED BY LOCAL HYDROLOGICAL AND LANDSCAPE SETTINGS.

HOWEVER, DROUGHT IS AN ELUSIVE PHENOMENON THAT IS DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY AND DEFINE UNIVERSALLY. IN THIS STUDY, WE ASSESSED THE PERFORMANCE OF A SET OF INDICATORS THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO DESCRIBE DROUGHT CONDITIONS IN THE SUMMER MONTHS (JUNE, JULY, AUGUST) OVER A 30-YEAR PERIOD (1981-2010) IN FINLAND. THOSE INDICATORS INCLUDE THE STANDARDIZED PRECIPITATION INDEX (SPI), THE STANDARDIZED PRECIPITATION-EVAPOTRANSPIRATION INDEX (SPEI), THE SOIL MOISTURE INDEX (SMI), AND THE SOIL MOISTURE ANOMALY (SMA). HEREIN, REGIONAL SOIL MOISTURE WAS PRODUCED BY THE LAND SURFACE MODEL JSBACH OF THE MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGY EARTH SYSTEM MODEL (MPI-ESM). RESULTS SHOW THAT THE BUFFERING EFFECT OF SOIL MOISTURE AND THE ASSOCIATED SOIL MOISTURE MEMORY CAN IMPACT ON THE ONSET AND DURATION OF DROUGHT AS INDICATED BY THE SMI AND SMA, WHILE THE SPI AND SPEI ARE DIRECTLY CONTROLLED BY METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. IN PARTICULAR, WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER THE SMI, SMA AND SPEI ARE ABLE TO INDICATE THE EXTREME DROUGHT AFFECTING FOREST HEALTH (EDF), WHICH WE DEFINED ACCORDING TO THE EXTREME DROUGHT THAT CAUSED SEVERE FOREST DAMAGES IN FINLAND IN 2006. THE EDF THRESHOLDS FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED INDICATORS ARE SUGGESTED, BASED ON THE REPORTED STATISTICS OF FOREST DAMAGES IN FINLAND IN 2006.

IN ADDITION, THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF THE EDF THRESHOLDS OVER THE SUMMER MONTHS OF THE 30-YEAR STUDY PERIOD, THE SPEI AND SMA TENDED TO SHOW MORE FREQUENT EDF EVENTS AND A HIGHER FRACTION OF INFLUENCED AREA THAN SMI. THIS IS BECAUSE THE SPEI AND SMA ARE STANDARDIZED INDICATORS THAT SHOW THE DEGREE OF ANOMALIES FROM STATISTICAL MEANS OVER THE AGGREGATION PERIOD OF CLIMATE CONDITIONS AND SOIL MOISTURE, RESPECTIVELY. HOWEVER, IN BOREAL FORESTS IN FINLAND, THE HIGH INITIAL SOIL MOISTURE OR EXISTENCE OF PEAT OFTEN PREVENT THE EDFS INDICATED BY THE SPEI AND SMA TO PRODUCE VERY LOW SOIL MOISTURE THAT COULD BE INDICATED AS EDFS BY THE SMI. THEREFORE, WE CONSIDER SMI IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR INDICATING EDFS IN BOREAL FORESTS. THE SELECTED EDF THRESHOLDS FOR THOSE INDICATORS COULD BE CALIBRATED WHEN THERE ARE MORE FOREST HEALTH OBSERVATION DATA AVAILABLE.

THE AIM OF THIS LONG-TERM INCUBATION EXPERIMENT WAS TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF HYDROLOGICAL AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL SOIL PROPERTIES ON EMISSIONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) AND METHANE (CH4). STRONGLY DEGRADED PEAT WITH SAND ADDITION (PEAT-SAND MIXTURES) AND WITHOUT SAND ADDITION (EARTHIFIED PEAT) WAS SYSTEMATICALLY COMPARED UNDER DIFFERENT MOISTURE CONDITIONS FOR FEN AND BOG PEAT. SOIL COLUMNS ORIGINATING FROM BOTH THE TOPSOIL AND THE SUBSOIL OF TEN DIFFERENT PEATLANDS UNDER GRASSLAND USE WERE INVESTIGATED. OVER A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS THE ALMOST SATURATED SOIL COLUMNS WERE DRAINED STEPWISE VIA SUCTION TO -300 HPA. THE CO2 FLUXES WERE LOWEST AT WATER-SATURATED AND DRY SOIL MOISTURE CONDITIONS, RESULTING IN A PARABOLIC DEPENDENCE OF CO2 FLUXES ON THE WATER-FILLED PORE SPACE (WFPS) PEAKING AT 56-92% WFPS. THE HIGHEST N2O FLUXES WERE FOUND AT BETWEEN 73 AND 95% WFPS.

CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION PATTERNS ASSOCIATED WITH NATURAL CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE ARE EXPECTED TO ALTER THE LOAD AND CHARACTER OF ORGANIC MATTER RELEASED FROM THESE AREAS, WHICH ULTIMATELY IMPACTS ON GROUNDWATER QUALITY AND DOM TREATABILITY. IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN GROUNDWATER DOM CHARACTER AFTER RAINFALL RECHARGE, WE SAMPLED SHALLOW GROUNDWATER FROM A COASTAL PEAT-RICH SAND AQUIFER IN NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA, DURING AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF LOW PRECIPITATION (AVERAGE DAILY PRECIPITATION RATE < 1.6 MM DAY(-1) OVER THE 8 MONTHS PRIOR TO SAMPLING), AND AFTER TWO HEAVY PRECIPITATION EVENTS (84 MM DAY(-1) AND 98 MM DAY(-1) RESPECTIVELY).

THOSE CATEGORISED INTO THE GROUPS POLYPHENOLICS AND CONDENSED AROMATICS) WERE 1.7 AND 2.0 TIMES HIGHER RESPECTIVELY THAN IN PRE-RAINFALL SAMPLES. WE ATTRIBUTE THIS TO THE FLUSHING OF PEAT-DERIVED DOM FROM BURIED ORGANIC MATERIAL INTO THE GROUNDWATER. WE ALSO IDENTIFY THAT PERIODS OF LOW PRECIPITATION CAN LEAD TO LOW HYDROPHILIC/HOC RATIOS IN GROUNDWATER (MEDIAN = 4.9, N = 14). REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS (RDA) WAS USED TO COMPARE THE HOC FRACTION WITH FT-ICR MS COMPOUND GROUPS. WE SHOW THAT HOC HAS A MORE AROMATIC CHARACTER IN PRE-RAINFALL SAMPLES, AND IS LESS SIMILAR TO THE AROMATIC GROUPS IN POST-RAINFALL SAMPLES. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE DECLINE IN WATER-BORNE HYDROPHOBICS OBSERVED POST-RAINFALL COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH PREFERENTIAL ADSORPTION OF THE HYDROPHOBIC AROMATIC DOM, MAKING POST-RAINFALL SAMPLES LESS TREATABLE FOR POTABLE WATER SUPPLY.

ALL TREES THAT WERE LESS THAN 83.5 CM ABOVE THE ROAD'S SINGLE CULVERT DIED IN 1989. THE TEMPORAL UNIFORMITY OF DIEBACK SUGGESTED THAT A SINGLE INUNDATION EVENT CAUSED THE TREES TO DROWN. THE INUNDATION LIKELY WAS CAUSED BY A CULVERT BLOCKED BY BEAVERS, AND INDICATES THE CRITICAL ROLE OF HYDROLOGIC PATTERNS AND PROCESSES FOR CONTROLLING VEGETATION COMPOSITION, INCLUDING TREE GROWTH PATTERNS AND MORTALITY. THE DISTURBANCE OF PEATLANDS BY ROADS COULD BE REDUCED OR ELIMINATED BY IMPROVING ROAD DESIGNS TO INCLUDE MULTIPLE CULVERTS THAT CANNOT EASILY BE BLOCKED BY DEBRIS OR BEAVERS, OR UNDERDRAIN SYSTEMS THAT CREATE MORE NATURAL SURFACE AND GROUND WATER FLOW PATTERNS. IN ADDITION, REGULAR INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE COULD LIMIT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF BLOCKED POINT LOCATIONS THAT CAN BE DAMMED BY BEAVERS.","USING TREE RING ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IMPACTS OF A ROAD ON A BOREAL PEATLAND","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","ARTICLE","NOV 15",2017,"10.1016/j.foreco.2017.08.007","FORESTRY","WOS:000413384000003"

THIS RESEARCH IS THE FIRST PUBLISHED ACCOUNT OF NA REDISTRIBUTION IN GROUNDWATER FROM A CONSTRUCTED TAILINGS SAND UPLAND TO AN ADJACENT CONSTRUCTED FEN PEAT DEPOSIT (NIKANOTEE FEN). A PERMEABLE PETROLEUM COKE LAYER UNDERLYING THE FEN, EXTENDING PARTWAY INTO THE UPLAND, WAS IMPORTANT IN DIRECTING FLOW AND NA BENEATH THE PEAT, AS DESIGNED. INITIALLY, NA+ CONCENTRATION WAS HIGHEST IN THE TAILINGS SAND (AVERAGE OF 232 MG L-1) AND LOWEST IN FEN PEAT (96 MG L-1). PRECIPITATION-DRIVEN RECHARGE TO THE UPLAND CONTROLLED THE MASS FLUX OF NA FROM UPLAND TO FEN, WHICH RANGED FROM 2 TO 13 TONS NA PER YEAR. THE MASS FLUX WAS HIGHEST IN THE DRIEST SUMMER, IN PART FROM DRY-PERIOD FLOWPATHS THAT DIRECT GROUNDWATER WITH HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF NA INTO THE COKE LAYER, AND IN PART BECAUSE OF THE HIGH EVAPOTRANSPIRATION LOSS FROM THE FEN IN DRY PERIODS, WHICH INDUCES UPWARD WATER FLOW. WITH THE ESTIMATED FLUX RATES OF 336 MM YR 1, THE NA ARRIVAL TIME TO THE FEN SURFACE WAS ESTIMATED TO BE BETWEEN 4 AND 11 YEARS. OVER THE FOUR-YEAR STUDY, AVERAGE NA CONCENTRATIONS WITHIN THE FEN ROOTING ZONE INCREASED FROM 87 TO 200 MG L-1, AND IN THE TAILINGS SAND DECREASED TO 196 MG L-1.

FOR TWO YEARS, WE MADE MONTHLY IN SITU MANIPULATIONS OF ELEVATED SALINITY IN FRESHWATER (FW) AND BRACKISH WATER (BW) SITES WITHIN EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK, FLORIDA, USA. SALINITY PULSES INTERACTED WITH MARSH-SPECIFIC VARIABILITY IN SEASONAL HYDROPERIODS WHEREBY EFFECTS OF ELEVATED PULSED SALINITY ON GROSS ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY (GEP), ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION (ER), AND NET ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY (NEP) WERE DEPENDENT ON MARSH INUNDATION LEVEL. WE FOUND LITTLE EFFECT OF ELEVATED SALINITY ON C CYCLING WHEN BOTH MARSH SITES WERE INUNDATED, BUT WHEN WATER LEVELS RECEDED BELOW THE SOIL SURFACE, THE BW MARSH SHIFTED FROM A C SINK TO A C SOURCE. DURING THESE EXPOSED PERIODS, WE OBSERVED AN APPROXIMATELY THREEFOLD INCREASE IN CO2 EFFLUX FROM THE MARSH AS A RESULT OF ELEVATED SALINITY. INITIALLY, ELEVATED SALINITY PULSES DID NOT AFFECT CLADIUM JAMAICENSE BIOMASS, BUT ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS BEGAN TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED IN THE SALTWATER AMENDED PLOTS AFTER TWO YEARS OF EXPOSURE AT THE BW SITE.

WE MONITORED PORE- AND SURFACE-WATER CHEMISTRY ACROSS A CHRONOSEQUENCE OF FORMERLY DRAINED, AFFORESTED BOG RESTORATION SITES SPANNING 0-17 YEARS, USING A SPACE-FOR-TIME SUBSTITUTION, AND COMPARED THEM WITH OPEN BLANKET BOG CONTROL SITES. OUR AIMS WERE TO MEASURE RATE OF RECOVERY TOWARDS BOG CONDITIONS AND TO IDENTIFY THE BEST SUITE OF WATER CHEMISTRY VARIABLES TO INDICATE RECOVERY. OUR RESULTS SHOW PROGRESS IN RECOVERY TOWARDS BOG CONDITIONS OVER A 0-17 YEAR PERIOD POST-RESTORATION. ELEMENTS SCAVENGED BY TREES (MG, NA, S) COMPLETELY RECOVERED WITHIN THAT PERIOD. MANY WATER CHEMISTRY VARIABLES WERE AFFECTED BY THE RESTORATION PROCESS ITSELF, BUT RECOVERED WITHIN 11 YEARS, EXCEPT AMMONIUM (NH4+), ZN AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC) WHICH REMAINED ELEVATED (WHEN COMPARED TO CONTROL BOGS) 17 YEARS POST RESTORATION. OTHER VARIABLES DID NOT COMPLETELY RECOVER (WATER TABLE DEPTH (WTD), PH), EXHIBITING WHAT WE TERM ""LEGACY"" EFFECTS OF DRAINAGE AND AFFORESTATION. EXCESS N AND A LOWERED WTD ARE LIKELY TO SLOW THE RECOVERY OF BOG VEGETATION INCLUDING KEY BOG PLANTS SUCH AS SPHAGNUM MOSSES. OVER 17 YEARS, WE MEASURED NEAR-COMPLETE RECOVERY IN THE CHEMISTRY OF SURFACE-WATER AND DEEP PORE-WATER BUT LIMITED PROGRESS IN SHALLOW PORE-WATER.

WE INVESTIGATED HOW RUNOFF GENERATION PROCESSES IN A SMALL, RIPARIAN PEATLAND-DOMINATED HEADWATER CATCHMENT (0.65 KM(2)) PROPAGATE TO LARGER SCALES (3.2 KM(2) AND 31 KM(2)) WITH DECREASING PERCENTAGE OF RIPARIAN PEATLAND COVERAGE. ISOTOPE DAMPING WAS MOST PRONOUNCED IN THE 0.65 KM(2) HEADWATER CATCHMENT DUE TO HIGH WATER STORAGE IN THE ORGANIC SOILS ENCOURAGING TRACER MIXING. AT THE LARGEST SCALE, STREAM FLOW AND WATER ISOTOPE DYNAMICS SHOWED A MORE FLASHY RESPONSE. THE ISOTOPIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SITES WAS MOST PRONOUNCED IN THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN STREAM WATER SIGNATURES WERE ENRICHED. DURING THE WINTER MONTHS, THE INTER SITE DIFFERENCE REDUCED.

THIS CONNECTIVITY RESULTED IN HIGH DOC CONCENTRATIONS AT THE PEATLAND SITE DURING BASEFLOW (SIMILAR TO 5 MG L(-1)). IN CONTRAST, AT THE LARGER SCALES, DOC WAS MINIMAL DURING LOW FLOWS (SIMILAR TO 2 MGL(-1)) DUE TO INCREASED GROUND-WATER INFLUENCE AND THE DISCONNECTION BETWEEN DOC SOURCES AND THE STREAM. HIGH FREQUENCY DATA ALSO REVEALED DIEL VARIABILITY DURING LOW FLOWS.

THE RESEARCH INCLUDED DETAILED GEOLOGICAL MAPPING, INCLUDING PIERCING OF A NUMBER OF BOREHOLES AND ELECTRICAL RESISTIVITY TOMOGRAPHY (ERT) SURVEYS. THE OBTAINED MATERIAL WAS POLLEN ANALYSED, OSL DATED, AND THE GRAIN SIZE DISTRIBUTION AND THE MORPHOSCOPY OF SAND QUARTZ GRAINS WERE INVESTIGATED; ADDITIONALLY THE ORGANIC MATTER (OM) CONTENT WAS DETERMINED. BASED ON THE OBTAINED RESULTS IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE STRUCTURE CURRENTLY OCCUPIED BY SEDIMENTS OF THE DRY VALLEY WAS FORMED DURING THE WARTA STADIAL OF THE ODRANIAN GLACIATION (SAALIAN; MIS 6) AS A GLACIAL TUNNEL VALLEY. SMALL, PROBABLY ISOLATED DEPRESSIONS FUNCTIONED IN THE DRY VALLEY BOTTOM AFTER THE ICE SHEET RETREAT. THE SEDIMENTS RECORD A FULL SUCCESSION OF CLIMATE OSCILLATIONS FROM THE EEMIAN INTERGLACIAL (MIS 5E) (POLLEN ZONES E1 TO E7) THROUGH THE EARLY VISTULIAN (MIS 5A-5D) TO MIS 4. IN THE EARLY VISTULIAN, THE DEPRESSIONS FUNCTIONED AS LAKES, OR GOT SHALLOWER AND WERE REPLACED BY PEAT-BOGS, DEPENDING ON THE CLIMATE CONDITIONS. DURING MIS 4, THE BOTTOM OF THE DRY VALLEY WAS SUBJECTED TO EROSION AS A RESULT OF CONCENTRATED WATER FLOW. THIS CAUSED DRAINING OF THE EXISTING DEPRESSIONS AND THEIR INCORPORATION WITHIN THE FLOW. PROBABLY DURING MIS 3, SOLIFLUCTION WAS ACTIVATED ON THE SLOPES OF THE DRY VALLEY.

CLEAR-CUTTING CHANGES THE MICROCLIMATE AND VEGETATION STRUCTURE AT THE SITE, BOTH OF WHICH AFFECT THE SITE'S CARBON BALANCE. PEAT SOILS WITH POOR AERATION AND HIGH CARBON DENSITIES ARE ESPECIALLY PRONE TO SUCH CHANGES, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN GREENHOUSE GAS EXCHANGE CAN BE EXPECTED. WE MEASURED CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) AND ENERGY FLUXES WITH THE EDDY COVARIANCE METHOD FOR 2 YEARS (APRIL 2016-MARCH 2018) AFTER CLEAR-CUTTING A DRAINED PEATLAND FOREST. WE OBSERVED A SIGNIFICANT RISE (23 CM) IN THE WATER TABLE LEVEL AND A LARGE CO2 SOURCE (FIRST YEAR: 3086 +/- 148 G CO2 M(-2) YR(-1); SECOND YEAR: 2072 +/- 124 G CO2 M(-2) YR(-1)).

THE UNIFORM STABLE ISOTOPE RATIOS IN THE ANAEROBIC LAYERS DEEPER THAN THE LOCAL MAXIMA OF THE ISOTOPIC SIGNATURES SUPPORT THE ASSUMPTION THAT MINOR C-13 FRACTIONATION OCCURS UNDER ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS. DELTA C-13 SLIGHTLY DECLINING WITH DEPTH IN THE WATERLOGGED LAYERS OF STRONGLY DEGRADED PEAT REFLECTS THE PREFERENTIAL UTILISATION AND LOSS OF LABILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS ENRICHED IN C-13.

UNDERSTANDING THESE CONTROLS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE GROUNDWATER CAN SUPPLY SOLUTES SUCH AS DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER TO SURFACE WATER BODIES. WE CALCULATED STEADY-STATE THREE-DIMENSIONAL SUPRAPERMAFROST GROUNDWATER FLOW THROUGH THE ACTIVE LAYER USING MEASUREMENTS OF AQUIFER GEOMETRY, SATURATED THICKNESS, AND HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES COLLECTED FROM TWO MAJOR LANDSCAPE TYPES OVER TIME WITHIN A FIRST-ORDER ARCTIC WATERSHED. THE DEPTH POSITION AND THICKNESS OF THE SATURATED ZONE IS THE DOMINANT CONTROL OF GROUNDWATER FLOW VARIABILITY BETWEEN SITES AND DURING DIFFERENT TIMES OF YEAR. THE EFFECT OF WATER TABLE DEPTH ON GROUNDWATER FLOW DWARFS THE EFFECT OF THAW DEPTH. IN LANDSCAPES WITH LOW LAND-SURFACE SLOPES (2-4%), A COMBINATION OF HIGHER WATER TABLES AND THICKER, PERMEABLE PEAT DEPOSITS CAUSE RELATIVELY CONSTANT GROUNDWATER FLOWS BETWEEN THE EARLY AND LATE THAWED SEASONS. LANDSCAPES WITH LARGER LAND-SURFACE SLOPES (4-10%) HAVE BOTH DEEPER WATER TABLES AND THINNER PEAT DEPOSITS; HERE THE COMMONLY OBSERVED PERMEABILITY DECREASE WITH DEPTH IS MORE PRONOUNCED THAN IN FLATTER AREAS, AND GROUNDWATER FLOWS DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN EARLY AND LATE SUMMER AS THE WATER TABLE DROPS. GROUNDWATER FLOWS ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY MICROTOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES THAT RETAIN GROUNDWATER THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE RELEASED AS THE ACTIVE LAYER DEEPENS. THE DOMINANT SOURCES OF GROUNDWATER, AND THUS DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER, ARE LIKELY WET, FLATTER REGIONS WITH THICK ORGANIC LAYERS. THIS FINDING INFORMS FLUID FLOW AND SOLUTE TRANSPORT DYNAMICS FOR THE PRESENT AND FUTURE ARCTIC. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY GROUNDWATER FLOW IN PERMAFROST WATERSHEDS IS POTENTIALLY A KEY COMPONENT OF GLOBAL CARBON BUDGETS BECAUSE PERMAFROST SOIL STORES VAST AMOUNTS OF CARBON THAT COULD BE MOBILIZED DUE TO A WARMING CLIMATE AND THE CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN SOIL THAW. IN ADDITION TO CARRYING CARBON, GROUNDWATER CAN SUPPLY IMPORTANT NUTRIENTS AND SOLUTES TO SURFACE WATERS. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT YET UNDERSTAND THE FACTORS THAT CONTROL GROUNDWATER FLOW IN SOILS ABOVE PERMAFROST BECAUSE SATURATION CHANGES RAPIDLY AND CONTINUOUSLY, AND SOIL HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN. WE CREATED MEASUREMENT-INFORMED CALCULATIONS OF GROUNDWATER FLOW FROM AREAS OF PERMAFROST WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS AND FOUND THAT SOIL TYPES, WHICH VARY BASED ON THE SLOPE OF THE LAND SURFACE, ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTROL. NEAR-SURFACE SOILS WERE IDENTICAL IN HILLSLOPES AND VALLEYS, WHEREAS DEEPER SOILS IN HILLSLOPES ALLOWED FOR LESS GROUNDWATER FLOW THAN IN VALLEYS. IN EARLY SUMMER, WHEN ONLY THE NEAR-SURFACE SOILS WERE THAWED, GROUNDWATER FLOWS IN THE HILLSLOPES AND VALLEY WERE SIMILAR. IN LATE SUMMER, WHEN THE DEEPER SOIL WAS THAWED, GROUNDWATER FLOW IN THE VALLEY REMAINED HIGH, BUT FLOW IN THE HILLSLOPE WAS NEGLIGIBLE.

ON ONE HAND, THIS LAYER ACTS AS AN AQUITARD FOR SEEPING WATER BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH BULK DENSITY.

HIGH-RESOLUTION LITHOLOGICAL (LOI, MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY), PALAEOBOTANICAL (POLLEN, PLANT MACROFOSSIL, TREE RINGS), ISOTOPIC (C-14) AND GEOCHEMICAL DATA WERE EMPLOYED TO RECONSTRUCT THE PECULIARITIES OF VEGETATION AND HYDROCLIMATE DYNAMICS, AS WELL AS TO DISCUSS RESULTS IN A LOCAL TO REGIONAL CONTEXT.

TO A PREDOMINANCE OF A WARM AND DRY CLIMATIC REGIME. INSTABILITY OF PALAEOBOTANICAL AND LITHOLOGICAL RECORDS SUGGESTS THAT ENVIRONMENTAL ANOMALIES OF THE EARLY HOLOCENE OCCURRED AT ABOUT 11,200-11,000 CAL BP, 10,600-10,300 CAL BP, AND 8200-7800 CAL BP. THESE ANOMALIES ARE THUS CONTEMPORANEOUS WITH THE PRONOUNCED CLIMATIC SHIFTS (I.E. DRY AND COOL INTERVALS) KNOWN AT THE CONTINENTAL SCALE. AN EXPANSION OF PICEA WAS FACILITATED BY THE 8200-7800 CAL BP CLIMATIC SHIFT WHEREAS EARLY ESTABLISHMENT OF ALNUS GLUTINOSA SUGGESTS AN ONSET OF A WET INTERVAL (10,200 CAL BP) WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN IN THE AREA. THE STEPWISE LOWERING OF THE WATER TABLE NOTED AT ABOUT 7300-7200 AND 6600-6700 CAL BP, WITH THE TERMINATION OF THE LAKE-PHASE AND CHANGE TO TELMATIC ENVIRONMENT AFTER 6100 CAL BP, PROVES THE POSITIVE REACTION OF THE SITE TO THE DRY CLIMATIC REVERSALS OF THE MIDDLE HOLOCENE. FOLLOWING THE DECAY OF THE BROAD-LEAVED THERMOPHILOUS FOREST AFTER 4500 CAL BP, A COLD CLIMATIC REVERSAL FAVORED THE FORMATION OF A DIVERSE MOSAIC-LIKE VEGETATION WHICH WAS THEN REPLACED BY HOMOGENOUS PINUS-PICEA VEGETATION AFTER 3400 CAL BP.

FIELD AND LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS WERE COMBINED WITH NUMERICAL MODELING OF DYNAMIC FLOW AND REACTIVE NITRATE TRANSPORT. FLOODING ENHANCES NITRATE REMOVAL IN GROUNDWATER PRIMARILY BY TWO MECHANISMS. FIRST, BY CREATING A STAGNANT FLOW ZONE BENEATH THE FLOODED AREA THEREBY INCREASING THE RESIDENCE TIME AND LEAVING MORE TIME FOR NITRATE REMOVAL. SECONDLY, NITRATE REMOVAL IS INCREASED BY ENHANCING UPWARD FLOW INTO THE HIGHLY REACTIVE ORGANIC-RICH TOP LAYERS. FLOODING THEREFORE CONTRIBUTES TO NITRATE REMOVAL IN HOT SPOTS, WHERE NITRATE IS TRANSPORTED TO THE PEAT AND DURING HOT MOMENTS, WHEN FLOW IS STAGNANT. THE PERMEABILITY OF THE CAPPING PEAT LAYER RELATIVE TO THE AQUIFER IS IMPORTANT AS IT CONTROLS BOTH MECHANISMS. THE MODEL SHOWS THAT THE DEEP-SEATED NITRATE REMOVAL IS GREATER THAN PROJECTED FROM THE LABORATORY NITRATE REDUCTION EXPERIMENTS. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY MANAGED RIPARIAN ZONES ARE OFTEN USED AS BUFFER ZONES TO ENHANCE REMOVAL OF NITRATE. RESTORATION OF RIPARIAN ZONES HAS INCLUDED RE-MEANDERING OF THE RIVER WITH THE PURPOSE OF CREATING FREQUENT FLOODING EVENTS SO THAT RIVER-ASSOCIATED NITRATE COULD BE REMOVED DUE TO DENITRIFICATION AND/OR PLANT UPTAKE ON THE FLOODPLAIN. LITTLE FOCUS, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN ON THE EFFECTS OF FLOODING ON NITRATE REMOVAL IN GROUNDWATER. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT FLOODING ALSO HAS A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON NITRATE REMOVAL, BECAUSE OF TWO PHYSICAL FLOW MECHANISMS. WHEN A RIPARIAN ZONE IS FLOODED, GROUNDWATER BENEATH THE FLOODED AREA WILL BE MORE STAGNANT AND ANY NITRATE TRAPPED INSIDE THIS ZONE WILL BE MORE QUICKLY REMOVED. SECONDLY, GROUNDWATER WILL ALSO FLOW TO THE SURFACE OF THE FLOODED PART AND BRING NITRATE INTO CONTACT WITH ORGANIC-RICH PEAT LAYERS AT THE SURFACE, ALSO ENHANCING NITRATE REMOVAL.","HYDROLOGICAL MEDIATED DENITRIFICATION IN GROUNDWATER BELOW A SEASONAL FLOODED RESTORED RIPARIAN ZONE","WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH","ARTICLE","MAR",2017,"10.1002/2016WR019581","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; LIMNOLOGY; WATER RESOURCES","WOS:000400160500021"

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO ELUCIDATE THE ROLES OF NOM IN THE TRANSPORT MEDIUM IN MEDIATING PARTICLE TRANSPORT. WE CONDUCTED EXPERIMENTAL AND MODELLING STUDY ON THE TRANSPORT OF NANOSCALE TITANIUM DIOXIDE (NTIO(2)) AND ILLITE COLLOID IN COLUMNS PACKED WITH QUARTZ SAND UNDER WATER-SATURATED CONDITIONS. PEAT MOSS WAS USED AS AN EXAMPLE NOM AND PACKED IN SOME OF THE COLUMNS TO INVESTIGATE ITS INFLUENCE ON PARTICLE TRANSPORT. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOWED THAT NOM MAY EITHER INCREASE OR DECREASE PARTICLE TRANSPORT DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC CONDITIONS. NOM IN THE TRANSPORT MEDIUM WAS FOUND TO ATTRACT PARTICLES AND REDUCE PARTICLE MOBILITY WHEN THE ENERGY BARRIER BETWEEN PARTICLE AND NOM IS LOW OR NON-EXISTENT. NOM ALSO ADSORB TO FE AND AL OXYHYDROXIDES AND PROMOTE THE TRANSPORT OF NEGATIVELY-CHARGED PARTICLES AT LOW PH. PARTIAL DISSOLUTION OF NOM RELEASES DOM, AND THE DOM ADSORBS TO AND INCREASES THE TRANSPORT OF POSITIVELY-CHARGED PARTICLES. ADDITIONALLY, NOM CHANGES PORE WATER PH, WHICH INFLUENCES PARTICLE MOBILITY BY AFFECTING THE INTERACTION ENERGY BETWEEN THE PARTICLE AND TRANSPORT MEDIUM. MODELLING RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE DEPOSITION SITES PROVIDED BY PEAT MOSS ARE VERY HETEROGENEOUS, AND THE NOM FROM PEAT MOSS MAY REDUCE PARTICLE DEPOSITION RATE BY ADSORBING TO THE PARTICLE AND/OR TRANSPORT MEDIUM. FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATE THAT NOM IN THE TRANSPORT MEDIUM NOT ONLY CHANGES PROPERTY OF THE MEDIUM, BUT ALSO MAY ALTER WATER CHEMISTRY.

TREATMENTS USED WERE THE SIX COMBINATIONS OF DAMMING OR NOT DAMMING PLOUGH FURROWS WITH LEAVING THE TREES ALIVE, FELLING AND LEAVING THEM ON THE GROUND OR FELLING AND REMOVING THEM. COMBINING FELLING WITH DAMMING FURROWS WAS MOST SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING THE WATER TABLE, WHETHER OR NOT THE FELLED TREES WERE REMOVED. ONLY WHERE FELLING WAS COMBINED WITH DAMMING DID THE WATER TABLE CONTINUE TO RECOVER BETWEEN YEARS 5 AND 10. OVER TEN YEARS, THE WATER LEVEL IN THESE TREATMENTS ROSE TO SLIGHTLY BELOW THAT OF NON-AFFORESTED REFERENCE BOG AT THE SAME SITES. THIS OCCURRED AS A RAPID INITIAL RISE, FOLLOWING WHICH THERE WAS ONLY VERY SLIGHT FURTHER IMPROVEMENT. FELLING CAUSED THE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF THE VEGETATION TO CHANGE TOWARDS THAT OF THE REFERENCE BOGS. THE PROCESS WAS SLOW, WITH THE VEGETATION BECOMING MORE DISSIMILAR TO NON-FORESTED REFERENCE BOG IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS AND THEN BECOMING MORE SIMILAR TO THE REFERENCE BOG AFTER YEAR 5. SURPRISINGLY, DAMMING PLOUGH FURROWS HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON THE VEGETATION EXCEPT THAT, IN COMBINATION WITH FELLING, IT INCREASED DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE PLOUGH FURROWS AND OTHER POSITIONS ON THE PLOUGHED GROUND. CONIFER SEEDLINGS ESTABLISHED ON THE RESTORED PLOTS, MOST DENSELY WHERE THEY ADJOINED STANDING FOREST, AND HAD SIMILAR DENSITY AND GROWTH IN ALL THE FELLED TREATMENTS. THE RESTORATION TREATMENTS RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN BULK DENSITY AND INCREASE IN WATER CONTENT OF THE UPPER PEAT, PROBABLY DUE TO AN UNLOADING EFFECT CAUSED BY THE RAISED WATER TABLE BUOYING UP THE DRAINED PEAT LAYER. IN SOME TREATMENTS THIS WAS AMPLIFIED BY REMOVAL OF THE WEIGHT OF THE TREES.

FOLLOWING REVEGETATION THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN DEPTH TO WATER TABLE AND AN INCREASE IN THE PREVALENCE OF HILLSLOPE OVERLAND FLOW PRODUCTION. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN STORM RUNOFF COEFFICIENT FOLLOWING EITHER RESTORATION TREATMENT. STORM HYDROGRAPHS FOLLOWING REVEGETATION HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER LAG TIMES (106% INCREASE RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL), REDUCED PEAK FLOWS (27% DECREASE RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL), AND ATTENUATED HYDROGRAPH SHAPES. WITH THE ADDITION OF GULLY BLOCKING THE EFFECT IS ALMOST DOUBLED. LAG TIMES INCREASED BY A FURTHER 94% AND PEAK FLOWS REDUCED BY AN ADDITIONAL 24% RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL.

HYDROLOGICAL RESTORATION WAS FOUND TO IMPACT THE WATER BALANCE THROUGH A DECREASE IN SLOW DEEP DRAINAGE AND AN INCREASE IN FAST SUPERFICIAL RUNOFF. OBSERVED DOC CONCENTRATIONS WERE HIGHER IN SUMMER IN THE REWETTED LOCATION COMPARED TO THE CONTROL AREA AND WERE LINKED TO A DIFFERENCE IN DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER COMPOSITION ANALYZED BY FLUORESCENCE. HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS, ESPECIALLY THE SEVERITY OF THE WATER-TABLE DRAWDOWN IN SUMMER, WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE MAJOR FACTOR CONTROLLING DOC-CONCENTRATION DYNAMICS. THE RESULTS OF THE SIMULATION SUGGEST THAT THE HYDROLOGICAL RESTORATION DID NOT AFFECT DOC LOADS, AT LEAST IN A SHORT-TERM PERIOD (3 YEARS). HOWEVER, IT IMPACTED THE TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF DOC EXPORTS, WHICH WERE THE MOST EPISODIC AND WERE MAINLY TRANSPORTED THROUGH FAST SURFACE RUNOFF IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE RESTORATION, WHILE SLOW DEEP DRAINAGE DOMINATED DOC EXPORTS IN THE CONTROL AREA.

HIS FIRST PAPERS IN 1908 CONCERNED UNCONFINED FLOW OF WATER IN SATURATED SOIL, ARISING IN THE DESIGN OF REQUIRED DITCH SPACING FOR DRAINING PEAT. HE DEVELOPED AND USED A GRAPHICAL METHOD TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. THIS AND OTHER PRACTICAL PROBLEMS STIMULATED HIS INTEREST IN NUMERICAL METHODS AND SOON LED HIM TO THE CHALLENGE OF NUMERICAL WEATHER PREDICTION. IN 1922 HE PUBLISHED THE BOOK WEATHER PREDICTION BY NUMERICAL PROCESS. HE DID THE RESEARCH FOR THIS BOOK UNDER DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES JUST BEFORE, DURING, AND RIGHT AFTER WORLD WAR I. THE BOOK WAS RECEIVED POSITIVELY, BUT METHODS LIKE THOSE PROPOSED IN IT WERE NOT SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED UNTIL THE INVENTION OF FAST DIGITAL COMPUTERS AROUND 1950. POSTHUMOUSLY, MOST OF RICHARDSON'S CONTRIBUTIONS IN VARIOUS FIELDS RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION. IMPORTANT EXCEPTIONS ARE HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOIL SCIENCE AND HYDROLOGY, ON WHICH WE FOCUS IN THIS PAPER. IN HIS 1922 BOOK, RICHARDSON FORMULATED AN ELABORATE MODEL FOR TRANSPORT PROCESSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE. FOR THE LOWER BOUNDARY OF HIS ATMOSPHERIC MODEL, HE NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE MOVEMENT OF LIQUID WATER, WATER VAPOR, AND HEAT IN THE UPPER LAYER OF THE SOIL, AND AT THE SOIL-ATMOSPHERE AND PLANT-ATMOSPHERE INTERFACES. FINDING LITTLE PREVIOUS WORK ON THIS, HE FIRST OF ALL FORMULATED THE PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION FOR TRANSIENT, VERTICAL FLOW OF LIQUID WATER IN SOIL. WE ARGUE THAT THE RESULTING EQUATION CAN RIGHTLY BE CALLED THE RICHARDSON-RICHARDS EQUATION.

HOWEVER, THEIR ROLE IN GREENHOUSE GASES (GHG) PRODUCTION AND GHG RESPONSES TO TEMPERATURE AND WATER TABLE CHANGES ARE UNCERTAIN. WE CONDUCTED A LABORATORY MICROCOSM EXPERIMENT TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE AND WATER TABLE ON TWO PEAT PROFILES (WITH AND WITHOUT MINERAL SEDIMENTS) ON THE GHG EMISSION AND CONCENTRATIONS AND ON THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE. TWO SOIL TYPES - SEDGE PEAT/MINERAL/CALCAREOUS SEDIMENTS (PMC) AND SEDGE PEAT/MOSS PEAT (PP) WERE INCUBATED FOR 28 DAYS UNDER FOUR TEMPERATURE/WATER TABLE TREATMENTS: 15 DEGREES C/-15 CM, 25 DEGREES C/-15 CM, 15 DEGREES C/-40 CM, AND 25 DEGREES C/-40 CM. SURFACE GHG EMISSIONS AND GHG CONCENTRATIONS FROM FOUR DEPTHS (SURFACE, ABOVE WATER TABLE, BELOW WATER TABLE, AND ABOVE MINERAL CONTACT) WERE MONITORED. RESULTS INDICATED THAT INCREASING TEMPERATURE HAD THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OVERALL GHG EMISSIONS. HIGH TEMPERATURE INCREASED GHG EMISSION (CO2 BY 28%, CH4 BY 133% AND 178% N2O) AND CONCENTRATIONS AT SURFACE AND AT DEPTH (CO2 BY 32-83%, CH4 BY 200-1600% AND N2O BY 61-230%) IN MOST SAMPLES. IN CONTRAST, LOWERING THE WATER TABLE DECREASED ONLY CH4 EMISSIONS. SOIL TYPES ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED GHG EMISSION AND CONCENTRATIONS: CO2 AND N2O FROM SUBSURFACE PEAT WERE HIGHER IN PP THAN PMC. MOREOVER, THERE WAS AN INTERACTION EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE AND SOIL TYPES FOR N2O: CONCENTRATIONS IN PP WERE MORE INCREASED BY HIGH TEMPERATURE ABOVE AND BELOW THE WATER TABLE. TO UNDERSTAND HOW TEMPERATURE INFLUENCES GHG, ESPECIALLY N2O PRODUCTION, 25 DEGREES C/-15 CM INCUBATED AND BACKGROUND (NOT INCUBATED) CORES WERE DISASSEMBLED TO MEASURE APPARENT ENZYME ACTIVATION ENERGY (EA), AND BACTERIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE ABOVE AND BELOW THE WATER TABLE. RESULTS INDICATED THAT HIGHER EA AND LESS RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF COPIOTROPHS WERE DETECTED IN PMC THAN IN PP, BECAUSE OF LESS LABILE C IN PMC. HIGH TEMPERATURE TREATMENT ALSO CHANGED THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AT THE CLASS LEVEL IN PP BUT NOT PMC. THESE TOGETHER RESULTED IN LESS INCREASE OF N2O PRODUCTION WITH INCREASING TEMPERATURE IN PMC.

THERMAL RECONNAISSANCE METHODS WERE USED TO LOCATE ZONES OF RAPID GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE, WHICH WERE PREDOMINANTLY FOUND ALONG THE CENTRAL CHANNEL OF A WIDER STREAM VALLEY SECTION. PORE-WATER CHEMISTRY AND TEMPORAL VERTICAL GROUNDWATER FLUX WERE MEASURED AT A SUBSET OF THESE ZONES DURING FIELD CAMPAIGNS OVER SEVERAL SEASONS. SEEPAGE ZONES IN OPEN-VALLEY SUB-REACHES GENERALLY SHOWED SUBOXIC CONDITIONS AND HIGHER DISSOLVED SOLUTES COMPARED TO THE UNDERLYING GLACIAL OUTWASH AQUIFER.

SEEPAGE IN THESE REPEAT SPAWNING ZONES WAS GENERALLY STRONGER AND MORE VARIABLE THAN IN OPEN-VALLEY SITES, WITH HIGHER DISSOLVED OXYGEN AND REDUCED SOLUTE CONCENTRATIONS.

LOCATION LAKE ATURTAUN, ROUNDSTONE BOG, IRELAND. METHODS IN A FLOATING FEN, TRANSECTS WERE SET OUT TO ANALYZE THE RELATION BETWEEN VEGETATION TYPE AND ROCK-PEAT DISTANCE AND POREWATER ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY. FURTHERMORE, THREE DISTINCT VEGETATION TYPES WERE STUDIED: RICH FEN, POOR FEN AND PATCHES OF POOR FEN WITHIN RICH FEN VEGETATION. BIOGEOCHEMICAL MEASUREMENTS WERE CONDUCTED IN A VERTICAL PROFILE TO DISTINGUISH ABIOTIC CONDITIONS OF DISTINCT VEGETATION TYPES. RESULTS GEOHYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS MAY DRIVE THE DISTRIBUTION OF POOR AND RICH FEN SPECIES AT A LARGER SCALE IN THE FLOATING FEN, DUE TO THE SUPPLY OF MINEROTROPHIC GROUNDWATER. INTERESTINGLY, BOTH RICH AND POOR FEN VEGETATION OCCURRED IN A MOSAIC, WHEN ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY VALUES AT 50 CM DEPTH WERE BETWEEN 300 MU S/CM AND 450 MU S/CM. ALTHOUGH ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WERE HOMOGENEOUS AT 50 CM, THEY DIFFERED MARKEDLY BETWEEN RICH AND POOR FEN VEGETATION AT 10 CM DEPTH.

HERE, WE EXAMINE HOW PEAT BURN SEVERITY AND WATER TABLE DEPTH (WTD) AFFECT THE STRENGTH OF ONE SUCH FEEDBACK-THE HYDROPHOBICITY-EVAPORATION FEEDBACK (HEF). THE HEF IS AN EVAPORATION-LIMITING FEEDBACK KNOWN TO MINIMIZE WATER LOSS FOLLOWING WILDFIRE. THE PEATLAND SURFACE BECOMES HYDROPHOBIC CREATING AN EVAPORATIVE CAP AND THEREBY REDUCING POST-FIRE EVAPORATION; HOWEVER, RECENT STUDIES HYPOTHESIZE THAT THIS IS DEPENDENT ON PEAT BURN SEVERITY. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE STUDIED PLOTS ALONG A PEAT BURN SEVERITY GRADIENT IN A PARTIALLY DRAINED BLACK SPRUCE PEATLAND THAT BURNED DURING THE 2016 FORT MCMURRAY HORSE RIVER WILDFIRE. EVAPORATION RATES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN PLOTS WHERE HYDROPHOBICITY WAS PRESENT. HYDROPHOBICITY WAS LOWEST IN THE SEVERELY BURNED AREA, AND THE AVERAGE INSTANTANEOUS EVAPORATION RATE (2.75 MM DAY(-1)) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN MODERATELY AND TYPICAL-LIGHTLY BURNED AREAS (0.82 AND 1.64 MM DAY(-1), RESPECTIVELY).

OUR RESULTS PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF A BURN SEVERITY THRESHOLD WHERE INCREASED DEPTH OF BURN REMOVES THE FEATHER MOSS EVAPORATIVE CAP AND CAUSES THE HEF TO BREAK DOWN. WE ARGUE THAT THIS THRESHOLD HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR BOREAL PEATLANDS, WHICH ARE PREDICTED TO UNDERGO CLIMATE-MEDIATED PRE-FIRE DRYING AND INCREASING BURN SEVERITIES, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO FURTHER CARBON LOSSES DUE TO ENHANCED POST-FIRE DRYING AND CONCOMITANT DECOMPOSITION.","THRESHOLD PEAT BURN SEVERITY BREAKS EVAPORATION-LIMITING FEEDBACK","ECOHYDROLOGY","ARTICLE","JAN",2020,"10.1002/eco.2168","ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; WATER RESOURCES","WOS:000495475900001"

IN PARTICULAR THE LOWERMOST UNIT OF SILURIAN BLACK SHALES IS REGIONALLY STRONGLY ENRICHED IN U. THE STRONG U-ENRICHMENT OF THESE SHALES IS THE RESULT OF THE HIRNANTIAN GLACIATION THAT REMOVED OLD NEAR-SURFACE ROCKS THAT ALREADY HAD LOST MOST LEACHABLE U DURING LONG-LASTING ALTERATION AND BROUGHT ROCKS WITH LEACHABLE U TO THE SURFACE. SEA LEVEL RISE DUE TO THE MELTING OF THE HIRNANTIAN ICE SHEET INUNDATED THE GLACIALLY MODELED CONTINENT MARGIN AND RESULTED IN REGIONALLY RESTRICTED OCEANIC CIRCULATION AND ANOXIC CONDITIONS THAT ARE RELATED TO BOTH LOW INITIAL OXYGEN LEVELS AND SUDDEN INCREASE OF ORGANIC PRODUCTION. ORGANIC-RICH SHALES ON THE GONDWANA SHELF DEVELOPED PARTICULARLY HIGH U CONTENT AS THEY SCAVENGED U FROM THE SURFACE RUNOFF THAT WAS LEACHED AFTER DEGLACIATION FROM THE NEWLY EXPOSED DRAINAGE AREA. THE PRESENT SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF SILURIAN U-RICH BLACK SHALES WITHIN THE VARISAN OROGENIC BELT IS LARGELY CONTROLLED BY LARGE-SCALE TECTONIC PROCESSES OPERATING DURING THE APPROACH AND EVENTUAL COLLISION OF GONDWANA AND LAURUSSIA, LEADING TO THE FORMATION OF WESTERN PANGEA. DURING THE VARISCAN OROGENY, THESE U-ANOMALOUS ROCKS BECAME STACKED AND FOLDED AT THE MARGINS OF SOME LOW-STRAIN DOMAINS OF THE OROGENIC BELT AND EXPOSED TO METAMORPHISM AND IN PART TO CRUSTAL MELTING - CONTRIBUTING TO THE FORMATION OF U-FERTILE POST-KINEMATIC GRANITES IN THE HIGH-STRAIN DOMAINS OF THE OROGENIC BELT. THERE ARE NO U DEPOSITS THAT ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE EMPLACEMENT OF THESE GRANITES. VARISCAN GRANITES, HOWEVER, ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT SOURCE OF LEACHABLE U FOR YOUNGER, MAJOR U MINERALIZATION. LATE-VARISCAN REORGANIZATION OF THE PLATE MOVEMENT BETWEEN GONDWANA AND LAURUSSIA RESULTED IN AN EXTENSIONAL TECTONIC REGIME THROUGHOUT EUROPE WITH IMPORTANT PERMIAN SEDIMENTARY BASINS. HEAT INPUT AND FLUID MIGRATION ALONG PERMIAN FAULT ZONES RESULTED IN THE FORMATION OF EPISYENITE-BOUND AND VEIN-TYPE U MINERALIZATION IN THE VARISCAN BASEMENT, WHEREBY U WAS LEACHED FROM GRANITES AND SILURIAN SEDIMENTARY ROCKS AND THEIR METAMORPHIC EQUIVALENTS AND WAS DEPOSITED IN LOCAL EPISYENITE AND VEIN-TYPE MINERALIZATION (E.G., DISTRICTS OF AUE-NIEDERSCHLEMA, JACHYMOV, PRIBRAM, FOREZ, AND SALAMANCA). LATE-VARISCAN EROSION OF THE OROGENIC BELT RESULTED IN THE REDISTRIBUTION OF U FROM VARISCAN METAMORPHIC ROCKS AND GRANITES, BUT ALSO THE SILURIAN BLACK SHALES, INTO LATE CARBONIFEROUS AND PERMIAN SEDIMENTARY BASINS. PERMIAN MOBILIZATION OF FAULT ZONES CONTROLED THE AVAILABILITY OF U-RICH SOURCE ROCKS FOR LEACHING, THE TRANSPORT OF U INTO THE BASINS, AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANIC-RICH SEDIMENTS THAT MAY TRAP U IN ORGANIC-RICH LAYERS (E.G., MILLEN, LODEVE). THE PERMIAN U REDISTRIBUTION REPRESENTS THE MAJOR DEPOSIT-FORMING EVENT THROUGHOUT VARISCAN EUROPE, WHEREBY HYDROTHERMAL U MINERALIZATION IN EPISYENITES AND VEINS IN THE VARISCAN BASEMENT AND LOW-TEMPERATURE U MINERALIZATION IN SANDSTONES AND ORGANIC-RICH SEDIMENTS ARE DIFFERENT EXPRESSIONS OF THE SAME TECTONIC PROCESS, I.E., THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN EXTENSIONAL PROVINCE. LATER TECTONIC REACTIVATIONS OF THESE FAULT ZONES DURING THE OPENING OF THE TETHYS AND NORTH ATLANTIC OCEANS AND DURING THE ALPINE OROGENY MAINLY RESULTED IN THE LOCAL REDISTRIBUTION OF U MINERALIZATION ALONG THE SAME FAULT ZONES AT C. 180 MA, 150 MA, AND 120 MA, AND MORE RECENTLY DURING THE ALPINE OROGENY, IN PART WITH ADDITION OF OTHER METALS (E.G., AG, BI, CO, NI, AS) LEACHED FROM THE LOCAL WALL ROCKS. POST-PERMIAN INTENSE CHEMICAL WEATHERING, MOSTLY IN THE TRIASSIC AND THE CRETACEOUS, RESULTED IN (I) U REDISTRIBUTION AND ADDITIONAL U CONCENTRATION WITHIN NEAR-SURFACE MINERALIZATION (E.G., RONNEBURG, AUE-NIEDERSCHLEMA), (II) LEACHING FROM NEAR-SURFACE U-RICH ROCKS FOLLOWED BY ENTRAPMENT IN SEDIMENTS TO FORM LIGNITE-TYPE (E.G., BLACK SHALES, PEATS) AND ROLL-TYPE MINERALIZATION (E.G., KONIGSTEIN), AND (III) THE DISPERSION OF U IN THE SUPERGENE ENVIRONMENT. THE ROCKS OF THE VARISCAN BELT HOST A HISTORY OF MORE THAN 400 MA OF U REDISTRIBUTION, STARTING WITH THE DEPOSITION OF EARLY SILURIAN U-RICH BLACK SHALES. THE FORMATION OF THESE BLACK SHALES IS CLIMATICALLY CONTROLLED. THEIR SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION EVENTUALLY CONTROLS THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF YOUNGER MINERALIZATION THAT IS GENERALLY CLOSELY RELATED WITH THE TECTONIC DEVELOPMENT AND REACTIVATION OF THE BASEMENT AND THE REDISTRIBUTION BY MAGMATIC, HYDROTHERMAL, AND EROSIONAL PROCESSES. BASEMENT FAULTS ARE PATHWAYS FOR FLUIDS AND THEIR REACTIVATION CONTROLS THE FORMATION AND INVERSION OF BASINS AND THE UPLIFT OF BASEMENT BLOCKS, EVENTUALLY LINKING THE ENDOGENIC U CYCLE (MAGMATIC AND HYDROTHERMAL ROCKS) WITH THE EXOGENIC U CYCLE (MAKING U-RICH ROCKS AVAILABLE FOR EROSION AND LEACHING AND CREATING TRAPS TO PRECIPITATE MOBILIZED U). THE TIMING OF POST-VARISCAN U MINERALIZATION IS CONTROLLED BY THESE TECTONIC REACTIVATIONS, WHEREAS SUPERGENE ENRICHMENT OR REDISTRIBUTION IS PARTICULARLY EFFICIENT IN PERIODS OF INTENSE CHEMICAL WEATHERING.","PHANEROZOIC URANIUM MINERALIZATION IN VARISCAN EUROPE - MORE THAN 400 MA OF TECTONIC, SUPERGENE, AND CLIMATE-CONTROLLED URANIUM REDISTRIBUTION","ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS","ARTICLE","NOV",2018,"10.1016/j.oregeorev.2018.09.013","GEOLOGY; MINERALOGY; MINING & MINERAL PROCESSING","WOS:000453493100024"

TO UNDERSTAND HOW NET THE ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE (NEE) OF CO2 WILL RESPOND TO CHANGING CLIMATIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES OF THE PROCESSES CONTRIBUTING TO NEE. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY AIMED TO PARTITION NEE AT THE SOIL-PLANT-ATMOSPHERE INTERFACE IN AN ARCTIC TUNDRA ECOSYSTEM AND TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS OF THESE FLUXES.

TO ESTIMATE THE LINKS BETWEEN HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES, SEDIMENT CORES WERE RETRIEVED IN LAKE JOUX AND SUBMITTED TO A MULTIPROXY ANALYSIS (HIGH-RESOLUTION PHOTOGRAPHS, MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY, DENSITY, X-RAY FLUORESCENCE, GRAIN SIZE, ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY, C-14, PB-210 AND CS-137 DATING). THE DIVERSITY OF ANTHROPICATION PHASES, DEFINED FROM HISTORICAL DATA, IS CLEARLY RECOGNIZED IN THE LAKE ARCHIVE. THE RECORD SUGGESTS THE REGION WAS MAINLY UNDER CLIMATIC INFLUENCE UNTIL THE END OF THE 13TH CENTURY. THE GROWTH OF SETTLEMENTS IN THE VALLEY AND THE ASSOCIATED MASSIVE DEFORESTATION IS RECORDED BY INCREASING TERRESTRIAL INPUTS, REFLECTING LARGE-SCALE SOIL DESTABILIZATION, WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY PERSISTS DESPITE THE TRANSITION FROM FARMING TO INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES. AUTOCHTHONOUS CONTRIBUTIONS THEN DOMINATE THE RECORD, BOTH IN RESPONSE TO CLIMATIC AND ANTHROPOGENIC INFLUENCES.

HOWEVER, THE COMBINED EFFECT OF RESIDUE INCORPORATION AND WATERTABLE MANAGEMENT ON GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS IN THESE HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE FEN PEAT SOILS REMAINS UNKNOWN. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, TWO WINTER COVER CROPS WITH CONTRASTING CARBON/NITROGEN RATIOS (VETCH [VICIA SATIVA], 45-60; RYE [SECALE CEREALE], 13-14) WERE INCORPORATED INTO PEAT SOILS AS GREEN MANURE (WITHOUT EXTRA SYNTHETIC/ORGANIC N ADDITION) AT TWO WATERTABLE DEPTHS (-50 AND -30 CM).

RESULTS THE LARGEST CONCENTRATIONS OF DOC WERE MEASURED IN DRY AND BARE SITES. LOWER E2:E3 RATIOS SUGGESTED A HIGHER AROMATICITY OF THE DOC AT THESE SITES THAT WERE NET SOURCES OF CO2 AND CH4. THE CONCENTRATION OF TDN WAS GREATER IN PLOTS WITH COTTONGRASS AND HIGH WATER TABLE, SUPPORTING A MORE ABUNDANT MICROBIAL BIOMASS. COTTONGRASS DOMINATED PLOTS ALSO HAD LARGER GAS EMISSIONS AS COMPARED TO BARE PLOTS EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NET C SINKS DUE TO THEIR HIGH PHOTOSYNTHETIC RATES. CONCLUSION MAINTAINING A HIGH WATER TABLE IS KEY TO REDUCING PEATLAND C LOSSES.

WATER DEMANDS OF ARABLE AGRICULTURE, PROTECTION FROM FLOOD RISK AND CONSERVATION NEEDS OF LOWLAND MESOTROPHIC WETLANDS NEEDED TO BE CONSIDERED. WATER MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOCUSED ON THE OUTLET ZONE OF BALGAVIES LAKE IN EASTERN SCOTLAND, WHERE THE LUNAN WATER DISCHARGES INTO A PARTIALLY CONFINED COMMON CHANNEL (LADE). WATER RELEASES TO A MILL, TO THE DOWNSTREAM RIVER, AND TO FLOODPLAIN WETLANDS (CHAPEL MIRES) ARE PARTIALLY CONTROLLED BY AN EXISTING WEIR. BASED ON OBSERVATIONS OF MANAGEMENT OF THIS WEIR, WE POSTULATED THAT UPGRADING HYDRAULIC MANAGEMENT IN THIS ZONE COULD REDUCE UPSTREAM FLOOD RISK, HELP PROTECT MESOTROPHIC WETLANDS AND FACILITATE DOWNSTREAM WATER SUPPLY AT LOW FLOWS. WE CONSIDERED POTENTIAL FOR: (A) INSTALLING A REMOTELY OPERATED TILTING WEIR, FOR IMPROVED MANAGEMENT OF RELEASE AND ROUTING OF FLOWS FROM THE COMMON LADE; (B) DREDGING OF THE COMMON LADE IN COMBINATION OR INSTEAD OF THE TILTING WEIR. RAPID ECOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT AND MIXING ANALYSIS OF THE LUNAN WATER WITH WATERS IN CHAPEL MIRES SHOWED A GRADIENT OF TROPHIC STATUS ACROSS THE WETLANDS LINKED TO IMPACT OF RIVER-BORNE NUTRIENTS. STAGE-DISCHARGE RELATIONSHIPS, DERIVED FROM STEADY-STATE APPROXIMATIONS OF THE IN-CHANNEL HYDRAULICS, SHOWED THAT THE PROPOSED TILTING WEIR HAD POTENTIAL TO DIVERT SEASONAL NUTRIENT RICH WATER FROM THE UPSTREAM LAKE AWAY FROM CHAPEL MIRES. SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED WEIR ON UPSTREAM FLOOD RISK WAS NOT DEMONSTRATED, BUT CARRYING OUT DREDGING OF THE CHANNEL REDUCED THE CURRENT OBSERVED PROBABILITY OF UPSTREAM FLOODING.

THE MODEL TREATS IN A CONSISTENT MANNER THE INTERACTION BETWEEN ATMOSPHERE, TERRESTRIAL VEGETATION AND SOIL THROUGH THE FLUXES OF ENERGY, WATER AND CARBON. ENERGY, WATER AND CARBON ARE CONSERVED. PALADYN EXPLICITLY TREATS PERMAFROST, BOTH IN PHYSICAL PROCESSES AND AS AN IMPORTANT CARBON POOL. IT DISTINGUISHES NINE SURFACE TYPES: FIVE DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES, BARE SOIL, LAND ICE, LAKE AND OCEAN SHELF. INCLUDING THE OCEAN SHELF ALLOWS THE TREATMENT OF CONTINUOUS CHANGES IN SEA LEVEL AND SHELF AREA ASSOCIATED WITH GLACIAL CYCLES. OVER EACH SURFACE TYPE, THE MODEL SOLVES THE SURFACE ENERGY BALANCE AND COMPUTES THE FLUXES OF SENSIBLE, LATENT AND GROUND HEAT AND UPWARD SHORTWAVE AND LONGWAVE RADIATION. THE MODEL INCLUDES A SINGLE SNOW LAYER. VEGETATION AND BARE SOIL SHARE A SINGLE SOIL COLUMN. THE SOIL IS VERTICALLY DISCRETIZED INTO FIVE LAYERS WHERE PROGNOSTIC EQUATIONS FOR TEMPERATURE, WATER AND CARBON ARE CONSISTENTLY SOLVED. PHASE CHANGES OF WATER IN THE SOIL ARE EXPLICITLY CONSIDERED. A SURFACE HYDROLOGY MODULE COMPUTES PRECIPITATION INTERCEPTION BY VEGETATION, SURFACE RUNOFF AND SOIL INFILTRATION. THE SOIL WATER EQUATION IS BASED ON DARCY'S LAW. GIVEN SOIL WATER CONTENT, THE WETLAND FRACTION IS COMPUTED BASED ON A TOPOGRAPHIC INDEX. THE TEMPERATURE PROFILE IS ALSO COMPUTED IN THE UPPER PART OF ICE SHEETS AND IN THE OCEAN SHELF SOIL. PHOTOSYNTHESIS IS COMPUTED USING A LIGHT USE EFFICIENCY MODEL. CARBON ASSIMILATION BY VEGETATION IS COUPLED TO THE TRANSPIRATION OF WATER THROUGH STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE. PALADYN INCLUDES A DYNAMIC VEGETATION MODULE WITH FIVE PLANT FUNCTIONAL TYPES COMPETING FOR THE GRID CELL SHARE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY. PALADYN DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN MINERAL SOIL CARBON, PEAT CARBON, BURIED CARBON AND SHELF CARBON. EACH SOIL CARBON TYPE HAS ITS OWN SOIL CARBON POOLS GENERALLY REPRESENTED BY A LITTER, A FAST AND A SLOW CARBON POOL IN EACH SOIL LAYER. CARBON CAN BE REDISTRIBUTED BETWEEN THE LAYERS BY VERTICAL DIFFUSION AND ADVECTION. FOR THE VEGETATED MACRO SURFACE TYPE, DECOMPOSITION IS A FUNCTION OF SOIL TEMPERATURE AND SOIL MOISTURE. CARBON IN PERMANENTLY FROZEN LAYERS IS ASSIGNED A LONG TURNOVER TIME WHICH EFFECTIVELY LOCKS CARBON IN PERMAFROST. CARBON BURIED BELOW ICE SHEETS AND ON FLOODED OCEAN SHELVES IS TREATED DIFFERENTLY.

THESE SWAMPS ARE CLASSIFIED AS TEMPERATE HIGHLAND PEAT SWAMPS ON SANDSTONE (THPSS) AND IN AUSTRALIA THEY ARE LISTED AS THREATENED ENDANGERED ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LEGISLATION. THIS STUDY APPLIES THE STABLE ISOTOPE DIRECT VAPOUR EQUILIBRATION METHOD IN A WETLAND, AIMING AT QUANTIFICATION OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF EVAPORATION, RAINFALL AND GROUNDWATER TO SWAMP WATER BALANCE. THIS TECHNIQUE POTENTIALLY ENABLES UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEPTH OF EVAPORATIVE LOSSES AND THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF GROUNDWATER FLOW WITHIN THE SWAMP ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT THE NEED FOR INTRUSIVE PIEZOMETER INSTALLATION AT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS AND DEPTHS. ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGES OF THE STABLE ISOTOPE DIRECT VAPOUR EQUILIBRATION TECHNIQUE INCLUDE DETAILED SPATIAL AND VERTICAL DEPTH PROFILES OF DELTA O-18 AND DELTA H-2, WITH GOOD ACCURACY COMPARABLE TO OTHER PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL EXTRACTION METHODS. DEPLETION OF DELTA O-18 AND DELTA H-2 IN PORE WATER WITH INCREASING DEPTH (TO AROUND 40-60 CM DEPTH) WAS OBSERVED IN TWO SWAMPS BUT REMAINED UNIFORM WITH DEPTH IN THE THIRD SWAMP. WITHIN THE UPPER SURFICIAL ZONE, THE MEASUREMENTS RESPOND TO SEASONAL TRENDS AND ARE SUBJECT TO EVAPORATION IN THE CAPILLARY ZONE. BELOW THIS DEPTH THE PORE WATER DELTA O-18 AND DELTA H-2 SIGNATURE APPROACHES THAT OF REGIONAL GROUNDWATER, INDICATING LATERAL GROUNDWATER CONTRIBUTION. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN STABLE PORE WATER ISOTOPE SAMPLES COLLECTED AFTER THE DRY WEATHER PERIOD COMPARED TO WET PERIODS WHERE RECHARGE OF DEPLETED RAINFALL (WITH LOW DELTA O-18 AND DELTA H-2 VALUES) WAS APPARENT. THE ORGANIC-RICH SOIL IN THE UPPER 40 TO 60 CM RETAINS SIGNIFICANT SATURATION FOLLOWING PRECIPITATION EVENTS AND MAINTAINS MOISTURE NECESSARY FOR ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING. AN IMPORTANT FINDING FOR WETLAND AND ECOSYSTEM RESPONSE TO CHANGING SWAMP GROUNDWATER CONDITIONS (AND POTENTIAL GROUND MOVEMENT) IS THAT BASAL SANDS ARE OBSERVED TO UNDERLAY THESE SWAMPS, ALLOWING RELATIVELY RAPID DRAINAGE AT THE BASE OF THE SWAMP AND LATERAL GROUNDWATER CONTRIBUTION. BASED ON THE NOVEL STABLE ISOTOPE DIRECT VAPOUR EQUILIBRATION ANALYSIS OF SWAMP SEDIMENT, OUR STUDY IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT PROCESSES: RAPID INFILTRATION OF RAINFALL TO THE WATER TABLE WITH LONGER RETENTION OF MOISTURE IN THE UPPER 40-60 CM AND LATERAL GROUNDWATER FLOW CONTRIBUTION AT THE BASE. THIS STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT EVAPORATION ESTIMATED USING THE STABLE ISOTOPE DIRECT VAPOUR EQUILIBRATION METHOD IS MORE REALISTIC COMPARED TO REFERENCE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION (ET). IMPORTANTLY, IF SWAMP DISCHARGE DATA WERE AVAILABLE IN COMBINATION WITH PORE WATER ISOTOPE PROFILES, AN APPROPRIATE TRANSPIRATION RATE COULD BE DETERMINED FOR THESE SWAMPS. BASED ON THE RESULTS, THE GROUNDWATER CONTRIBUTION TO THE SWAMP IS A SIGNIFICANT AND PERHAPS DOMINANT COMPONENT OF THE WATER BALANCE.

A DATA SET OF PEAT SUBSIDENCE AS WELL AS THE BULK DENSITY (BD) CHANGE RATE FOLLOWING ARTIFICIAL DRAINAGE WAS ASSEMBLED FROM THE LITERATURE. THE COLLECTED DATA COVER A TIME PERIOD OF UP TO 272 YEARS OF LAND DRAINAGE FOR FORESTRY AND AGRICULTURE IN BOREAL AND TEMPERATE CLIMATE ZONES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SUBSIDENCE RATE AND BD CHANGE RATE, AND HYDROPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF PEAT CAN BE ESTIMATED BASED ON LAND DRAINAGE DURATION AND LAND USE. THE MOST SEVERE SHIFT IN PORE STRUCTURE OF PEAT OCCURS WITHIN THE FIRST 20 YEARS OF LAND DRAINAGE. PEATLAND DRAINAGE REDUCES MACROPOROSITY WITH PORE DIAMETER GREATER THAN 50 MU M, BUT INCREASES THE VOLUME OF PORES <5 MU M. IN THE LONG TERM, PEAT THICKNESS LOSS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN 80% OF WATER STORAGE LOSS.

THREE TYPES OF WATERS, WHICH WERE DEFINED BY EXTRACTABILITY, WERE COLLECTED FROM THE PEAT. TWO WATERS WERE EXTRACTED BY COMPRESSING SAMPLES WITH DIFFERENT PRESSURES (SQW1 AND SQW2).

H-3 WAS DETECTED IN ALL TYPES OF WATER FROM DEPTHS OF 0-50 CM: THE CONCENTRATIONS IN SQW1, SQW2 AND DW RANGED 1.17-3.07 BQ/L, 0.98-2.03 BQ/L, AND 1.02-1.54 BQ/L, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAXIMUM H-3 CONCENTRATIONS OF SQW1, SQW2 AND DW WERE ALL DETECTED AT A DEPTH OF AROUND 15 CM, WHOSE C-14 AGE COVERS THE YEAR OF THE ATOMIC BOMB EXPERIMENTS. THE H-3 RESULTS OF SQW1/2 INDICATE THAT SQW CONSISTS OF AT LEAST TWO WATERS OF DIFFERENT MOBILITY, WATER FLOWING RAPIDLY DOWNWARD AND IMMOBILE WATER. SPHAGNUM HYALINE CELLS MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IMMOBILE WATER. THE DELTA O-18 AND DELTA H-2 RELATIONSHIP EXHIBITED INDEPENDENT TRENDS BETWEEN SQW AND DW. THE DISTINCT DIFFERENCE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE TWO WATERS AT THE SURFACE (0-5 CM) INDICATES THAT THE TWO WATERS MAY BE SUPPLIED BY PRECIPITATION AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE YEAR, OR ALTERNATIVELY THAT DW COMPRISES PLANT WATER TAKEN IN FROM HYALINE CELLS. THE DELTA O-18 AND DELTA H-2 VALUES OF BOTH SQW AND DW IN THE SHALLOW LAYER INCREASED WITH INCREASING DEPTH, AND IN THE LAYER AROUND 30 CM DEPTH, THOSE OF SQW SHOWED A DISTINCT DECREASE WITH DEPTH.

THESE PARAMETERS ARE: (I) THE WATER TABLE DEPTH (WTD) IN RELATION TO THE SURFACE, WHICH IS RECONSTRUCTED BASED ON THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF THE SUBFOSSIL TESTATE AMOEBA ASSEMBLAGES; (II) THE PEAT HUMIFICATION ESTIMATED AS ABSORPTION OF ALKALINE EXTRACT THAT DIRECTLY REFLECTS MOISTURE AT WHICH THE PEAT WAS FORMED; (III) THE CLIMATE MOISTURE INDEX (CMI) AND THE ARIDITY INDEX DERIVED FROM POLLEN-BASED RECONSTRUCTIONS OF THE MEAN ANNUAL TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION AND CLASSIFYING MOISTURE CONDITIONS AS THE RATIO BETWEEN AVAILABLE ANNUAL PRECIPITATION AND POTENTIAL LAND SURFACE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION. ALL THESE PARAMETERS PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PALEOCLIMATE (ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE COMPONENT) DYNAMICS. HIGH VALUES OF WTD AND PEAT HUMIFICATION APPEAR TO COMPLY WITH GUTENBERG-RICHTER LAW.

THE BOREAL FOREST IS THE LARGEST GLOBAL TERRESTRIAL BIOME AND IS HIGHLY THREATENED DUE TO CURRENT AND PROJECTED INCREASES IN TEMPERATURES FOR THE NORTHERN LATITUDES. HERE WE EXPLORE THE DYNAMICS AMONG ANNUAL BLACK SPRUCE GROWTH, CLIMATE, AND WATER TABLE ELEVATIONS USING 45 YEARS OF IN SITU PRECIPITATION, TEMPERATURE, AND WATER TABLE ELEVATION COUPLED WITH DENDROCHRONOLOGICAL ANALYSIS FROM SIX RESEARCH PEATLANDS AT THE MARCELL EXPERIMENTAL FOREST, MN, USA. FROM 1963 TO 2010, WE FOUND WEAK RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WATER TABLE ELEVATION AND BLACK SPRUCE GROWTH AT THE SIX STUDY SITES. INSTEAD, ANNUAL BLACK SPRUCE GROWTH WAS MOST FAVOURABLE DURING THREE CLIMATIC PERIODS: (A) COOL, MOIST CONDITIONS IN MID-SUMMER; (B) WARM MID-SPRING TEMPERATURES; AND (C) COOL TEMPERATURES IN THE FALL PRIOR TO THE CURRENT GROWING SEASON. THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN BLACK SPRUCE GROWTH AND WATER TABLE DYNAMICS WAS SURPRISING AND SUGGESTS THAT EITHER ANNUAL BLACK SPRUCE GROWTH IS MINIMALLY RESPONSIVE TO HYDROLOGICAL FLUCTUATIONS AT THE TIMESCALE WE ANALYSED OR THERE IS GREAT ELASTICITY OF BLACK SPRUCE GROWTH TO PEATLAND WATER TABLE AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION DYNAMICS UNDER THE RANGE OF HYDROLOGICAL FLUCTUATIONS CONTAINED IN OUR RECORD.","CLIMATIC CONTROLS ON PEATLAND BLACK SPRUCE GROWTH IN RELATION TO WATER TABLE VARIATION AND PRECIPITATION","ECOHYDROLOGY","ARTICLE","OCT",2019,"10.1002/eco.2137","ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; WATER RESOURCES","WOS:000478186500001"

HOWEVER, FIELD OBSERVATIONS PRESENT LARGE UNCERTAINTIES IN EBULLITION OCCURRENCES AND STATISTIC MODELS ARE NEEDED TO DESCRIBE THE FUNCTION RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROBABILITY OF EBULLITION OCCURRENCE AND WATER LEVEL CHANGES. A FLOW-THROUGH CHAMBER WAS DESIGNED AND INSTALLED IN A MUDFLAT OF AN ESTUARINE TEMPERATE MARSH. EPISODIC INCREASES IN CH4 CONCENTRATION SIGNALING EBULLITION EVENTS WERE OBSERVED DURING EBBING TIDES (15 EVENTS OVER 456 EBBING TIDES) AND OCCASIONALLY DURING FLOODING TIDES (4 EVENTS OVER 455 FLOODING TIDES). EBULLITION OCCURRENCE FUNCTIONS WERE DEFINED USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION AS THE RELATIVE INITIAL AND END WATER LEVELS, AS WELL AS TIDAL AMPLITUDES WERE FOUND TO BE THE KEY FUNCTIONAL VARIABLES RELATED TO EBULLITION EVENTS. EBULLITION OF METHANE WAS RESTRICTED BY A SURFACE FROZEN LAYER DURING WINTER; MELTING OF THIS LAYER DURING SPRING THAW CAUSED INCREASES IN CH4 CONCENTRATION, WITH EBULLITION FLUXES SIMILAR TO THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE FLUCTUATIONS IN WATER LEVEL AROUND SPRING TIDES. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT INITIAL AND END RELATIVE WATER LEVELS, IN ADDITION TO TIDAL AMPLITUDE, PARTLY REGULATE EBULLITION EVENTS IN TIDAL WETLANDS, MODULATED BY THE LUNAR CYCLE, STORAGE OF GAS BUBBLES AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS AND SEASONAL CHANGES IN THE SURFACE FROZEN LAYER. MAXIMUM TIDAL STRENGTH OVER A FEW DAYS, RATHER THAN HOURLY WATER LEVEL, MAY BE MORE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF EBULLITION OCCURRENCE AS IT REPRESENTS A TRADE-OFF TIME SCALE IN BETWEEN HOURLY AND LUNAR PERIODS.","METHANE EMISSION THROUGH EBULLITION FROM AN ESTUARINE MUDFLAT: 2.

WE UTILIZE MEDIUM-TERM, HIGH FREQUENCY HYDROLOGICAL DATA FROM AN ALKALINE FEN IN NORTHERN GERMANY AS WELL AS DATA ON FLORAL SPECIES COMPOSITION AND LIGHT AVAILABILITY. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT ET RATES ARE SIMILAR IN THE MOWED FEN WITH TREE CLEARANCE (CLEARED/MOWED FEN) AND IN THE ONLY-MOWED FEN. THE ONLY-MOWED FEN HAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ET RATES COMPARED TO THE ALDER CARR AND ONE PART OF THE WILLOW FOREST.

KLUKI PEAT BOG IS ONLY PARTIALLY PROTECTED BY POLISH LAW. THE LACK OF EFFORTS TO PREVENT OUTFLOW VIA THE CANAL IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE CANAL IS UTILISED TO DRAIN MEADOWS IN THE VICINITY OF THE VILLAGE OF LOKCIOWE OUTSIDE OF THE NATIONAL PARK.

TO ASSESS THE BIOPHYSICAL IMPACTS OF PEATLANDS AND FORESTS ON PEAK GROWING SEASON AIR TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY, WE ANALYSED SURFACE ENERGY FLUXES AND ALBEDO FROM 35 PEATLANDS AND 37 EVERGREEN NEEDLELEAF FORESTS-THE DOMINANT BOREAL FOREST TYPE-AND SIMULATED AIR TEMPERATURE AND VAPOUR PRESSURE DEFICIT (VPD) OVER HYPOTHETICAL HOMOGENEOUS PEATLAND AND FOREST LANDSCAPES. WE RAN AN EVAPOTRANSPIRATION MODEL USING LAND SURFACE PARAMETERS DERIVED FROM ENERGY FLUX OBSERVATIONS AND COUPLED AN ANALYTICAL SOLUTION FOR THE SURFACE ENERGY BALANCE TO AN ATMOSPHERIC BOUNDARY LAYER (ABL) MODEL. WE FOUND THAT PEATLANDS, COMPARED TO FORESTS, ARE CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER GROWING SEASON ALBEDO, LOWER AERODYNAMIC CONDUCTANCE, AND HIGHER SURFACE CONDUCTANCE FOR AN EQUIVALENT VPD. THIS COMBINATION OF PEATLAND SURFACE PROPERTIES RESULTS IN A SIMILAR TO 20% DECREASE IN AFTERNOON ABL HEIGHT, A COOLING (FROM 1.7 TO 2.5 DEGREES C) IN AFTERNOON AIR TEMPERATURES, AND A DECREASE IN AFTERNOON VPD (FROM 0.4 TO 0.7 KPA) FOR PEATLAND LANDSCAPES COMPARED TO FOREST LANDSCAPES. THESE BIOPHYSICAL CLIMATE IMPACTS OF PEATLANDS ARE MOST PRONOUNCED AT LOWER LATITUDES (SIMILAR TO 45 DEGREES N) AND DECREASE TOWARD THE NORTHERN LIMIT OF THE BOREAL BIOME (SIMILAR TO 70 DEGREES N).

THE TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN THE AMPLITUDE OF THE DIEL DOC CYCLE WAS CONTROLLED BY ANTECEDENT TEMPERATURE. DOWNSTREAM, THE DID DOC SIGNAL WAS WEAKER, WITH AROUND 4-FOLD LOWER AMPLITUDES AND MINIMA IN THE AFTERNOON. THE LOWER PROPORTION OF RIPARIAN PEAT DOWNSTREAM APPEARED TO REDUCE THE INFLUENCE OF TERRESTRIAL PROCESSES ON DOC CYCLES. IN-STREAM PHOTODEGRADATION AND DECOMPOSITION LIKELY BECAME MORE DOMINANT AS CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN DOC SOURCES AND STREAM REDUCED.

MEAN ANNUAL TOC CONCENTRATIONS IN THE NAREW RIVER BASIN WERE HIGHER THAN 10-11 MG C L-1 WHICH IS SIMILAR TO NEMORAL OR BALTIC RIVERS. THE MAXIMAL MONTHLY TOC CONCENTRATIONS OCCURRED IN MAY WITH A ONE-MONTH DELAY FROM THE SPRING MAXIMUM OF WATER OUTFLOW. HIGH TOC CONCENTRATIONS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY NATURALLY INCREASED ORGANIC NITROGEN AND PHOSPHOROUS CONCENTRATIONS RESULTING IN DECREASED WATER QUALITY CLASS DESPITE THE ANTHROPOGENIC PRESSURE IS LOW. MEAN ANNUAL EXPORT OF TOC FROM THE NAREW RIVER CATCHMENT AMOUNTED TO 2.15 G C M(-2), WHICH IS NEARLY 25% HIGHER THAN FOR THE VISTULA RIVER, THE RECIPIENT. TOC EXPORT FORM THE ANALYSED RIVER BASIN IN DRY YEARS WAS 30% LOWER AND 50% HIGHER IN WET YEARS THAN THE MULTIANNUAL AVERAGE. THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF HIGH TOC CONCENTRATIONS IN THE NAREW RIVER CATCHMENT AND HIGH TOC EXPORT IS THE OCCURRENCE OF BIOGEOCHEMICALLY ACTIVE WETLANDS, FUNCTIONING NOT ONLY THANKS TO SPRING FLOODING OF THE VALLEYS, BUT ALSO BASED ON PERMANENT INTENSIVE GROUNDWATERS SUPPLY FROM SURROUNDING PLATEAUS. THIS EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANCE OF BASIN HYDROLOGY IN THE REGULATION OF CARBON CYCLING IN THE TEMPERATE LOWLAND CATCHMENTS. OUR RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT IN ENVIRONMENTAL ZONATION OF EUROPE NAREW RIVER CATCHMENT SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS BELONGING TO THE BALTIC PROVINCE (NEMORAL ENVIRONMENTAL ZONE) RATHER THEN TO CONTINENTAL ZONE.

THE MICRORELIEF SAND LAYER WATER, EVAPORITE MINERALS, AND LAKESIDE HYDROGEOLOGICAL FEATURES WERE ANALYZED BY THE DRYING AND WEIGHING METHOD, ENVIRONMENTAL SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY WITH ENERGY SPECTRUM ANALYSIS FUNCTIONS, AND A HYDROGEOLOGICAL BOREHOLE SURVEY. THE WATER CONTENT OF THE MICRORELIEF 0-0.5 M SAND LAYER IS BETWEEN 4.7% AND 9.3%. THE EVAPORITE MINERALS ARE MAINLY COMPOSED OF CALCITE (CACO3) AND GYPSUM (CASO4). THE SHALLOW GROUNDWATER SYSTEM IN THE OFF-SHORE AREA OF LAKES CONSISTS OF AN AEOLIAN SAND LAYER, A PEAT LAYER, AND A LACUSTRINE SEDIMENTARY LAYER, AND THE PHREATIC WATER WITH A THICKNESS OF 20 CM TO 40 CM IS RESERVED IN THE BOTTOM OF AEOLIAN SAND LAYER WITH A PEAT LAYER AS A WATERPROOF BASEBOARD. BASED ON THESE RESULTS, THE ABOVE THREE NATURAL PHENOMENA CAN BE EXPLAINED AS FOLLOWS: (1) THE ASSEMBLAGE OF MEGADUNE MICRORELIEF AND EVAPORITE WAS CAUSED BY THE OUTCROPPING OF WATER FROM MEGADUNE VADOSE ZONE IN THE FORM OF PREFERENTIAL FLOW FOR A LONG TIME. ITS LEADING EDGE DIFFERENTIAL WIND EROSION AND CALCIUM CEMENTED FINE SAND LAYER INDICATE THAT WATER FROM THE MEGADUNE VADOSE ZONE MOVES TO AND RECHARGES THE MICRORELIEF WATER ALONG THE MICRO-SCALE FINE SAND LAYER, DURING WHICH, IT FEATURES A MULTIPLE LAYER AS IT IS CONTROLLED BY A VERTICAL DUNE BEDDING STRUCTURE. (2) THE SMALL-SCALE ASSEMBLAGE OF MEGADUNE VEGETATION AND MICRORELIEF INDICATES THAT THE WATER FROM THE MEGADUNE VADOSE ZONE MOVED LATERALLY AND LED TO VEGETATION DEVELOPMENT, AND THE ASSEMBLAGE OF MICRORELIEF AND VEGETATION AT A SLOPE SCALE INDICATES THAT THE VADOSE ZONE WATER PRESENTED MULTILAYER ENRICHMENT AND RUNOFF PRODUCING DUE, TO A GREAT EXTENT, TO THE BEDDING STRUCTURES OF DIFFERENT SPACIAL LOCATIONS. (3) THE ASSEMBLAGE OF LAKESIDE RUNOFF AND VEGETATION IS RELATED TO THE PHREATIC WATER RECHARGED BY PRECIPITATION SURROUNDING THE LAKE, WHICH INDICATES THAT THE MEGADUNE WATER RECHARGED BY PRECIPITATION MOVED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MEGADUNE AND CONSTITUTED SUPPLY TO THE LAKE WATER. THE THREE ASSEMBLAGES FULLY DEMONSTRATE THAT THE MEGADUNE WATER RECHARGED BY PRECIPITATION IN THIS DESERT COULD RECHARGE THE GROUNDWATER WATER AND EVEN LAKE WATER IN THE FORM OF PREFERENTIAL FLOW DUE TO THE CONTROL OF THE BEDDING STRUCTURE OF DIFFERENT SCALES WITHIN THE MEGADUNE.

THREE YEARS OF HYDROCHEMICAL AND HYDROLOGIC DATA (2013-2015) OBTAINED FROM THE CONSTRUCTED TREE ISLANDS SUGGEST THAT UNDER CURRENT CLIMATIC AND MANAGED HYDROLOGIC CONDITIONS, CALCITE DISSOLUTION IS PREVALENT WITHIN THE TOP METER OF SOIL IN BOTH TYPES OF TREE ISLANDS.

AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS AND PRIMARY ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS DRIVING FOREST SWAMP CONVERSIONS IS IMPERATIVE FOR EXPLORING THE MECHANISM OF FOREST SWAMP CONVERSIONS. WE INVESTIGATED THE LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS OF FOREST SWAMP CONVERSIONS AND QUANTIFIED THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS DRIVING THESE CONVERSIONS FOR THE PERIOD FROM 1990 TO 2015 IN THE GREAT XING'AN MOUNTAINS OF CHINA. WE FOUND THAT FOREST SWAMPING DISPLAYED HIGH PATCH NUMBERS (34,916) AND DENSITY (8.51/100 HA), COMMONLY OCCURRING AT THE EDGE OF LARGE AREAS OF FORESTS. MEADOW SWAMPING WAS LOCALIZED WITH LOW PATCH NUMBERS (3613) AND DENSITY (0.88/100 HA) DUE TO LACK OF WATER RECHARGE FROM GROUND WATER. WATER BODY SWAMPING HAD COMPLEX SHAPES (PERIMETER AREA RATIO MEAN = 348.32) BECAUSE OF WATER TABLE FLUCTUATIONS AND HELOPHYTE GROWTH DURING THIS CONVERSION PROCESS. CONVERSIONS TO FARMLAND PRESENTED FAIRLY REGULAR (PERIMETER AREA RATIO MEAN = 289.91) AND AGGREGATED (AGGREGATION INDEX = 67.82) CHARACTERISTICS AFFECTED BY AGRICULTURAL IRRIGATION AND MANAGEMENT. WE FOUND THAT CLIMATIC AND GEOMORPHIC FACTORS WERE RELATIVELY IMPORTANT COMPARED TO TOPOGRAPHIC FACTORS FOR FOREST SWAMP CONVERSIONS. NEGATIVE GEOMORPHIC CONDITIONS PROVIDED THE WATERLOGGING ENVIRONMENT AS A PRECONDITION OF SWAMP FORMATION. SUFFICIENT PRECIPITATION WAS AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF WATER RECHARGE DUE TO THE EXISTENCE OF PERMAFROST REGIONS AND LONG-TERM LOW TEMPERATURE REDUCED THE EVAPORATION OF SWAMPS WATER AND THE DECOMPOSITION RATE OF ORGANISMS.

FIRST, A PLOT-SCALE FIELD EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED BY SEEDING WITH TWO GRASS SPECIES (HOLCUS LANATUS AND AGROSTIS CAPILLARIS) TO STUDY THE N UPTAKE POTENTIAL FROM A HARVESTED AREA. SECONDLY, A SIMULATED RAINFALL EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF THESE GRASSES ON REDUCING N LEACHING FROM SURFACE PEAT USING LABORATORY FLUME APPROACH. IN THE END, THE ROLE OF SEEDED GRASSES IN REMOVING N FROM NUTRIENT-RICH THROUGHFLOW WATER WAS ASSESSED USING SIMULATED OVERLAND FLOW EXPERIMENT. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE SEEDED GRASSES HAD THE POTENTIAL TO UPTAKE OVER 30 KG HA(-1) OF N IN THE FIRST YEAR AFTER SEEDING ON HARVESTED PEATLANDS, WHEREAS IT TAKES OVER 2.5 YEARS TO ESTABLISH THE SAME LEVEL OF N UPTAKE BY NATURAL RE-VEGETATION (NON-GRASSED).

IN THE SIMULATED OVERLAND FLOW EXPERIMENT, THE N RETENTION BY GRASSED FLUMES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER (98%) AS COMPARED TO NON-GRASSED FLUMES (70%) IN THE SIMULATED OVERLAND FLOW EXPERIMENT. COMPARATIVELY HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF NH4+-N AND NO3--N IN SOIL POREWATERS OF NON-GRASSED FLUMES SUGGEST THAT THIS N RETENTION BY NON-GRASSED FLUMES IS LESS SUSTAINABLE AND IS LIKELY TO BE LEACHED IN RUNOFF IN SUBSEQUENT FLOW EVENTS. THE RESULTS FROM ALL THREE EXPERIMENTS IN THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT SEEDED GRASSES ARE A MAJOR SINK OF N ON HARVESTED BLANKET PEATLAND FORESTS.

CONTINUOUS MEASUREMENTS OF THE WATER TABLE LEVEL, PRECIPITATION AND AIR TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY WERE PERFORMED BETWEEN MAY AND OCTOBER IN THE YEAR 2016.

A NOVEL APPLICATION OF USING AGAROSE GEL AS A SOIL ANALOGUE IS PROPOSED, WHICH CAN ENABLE DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED BIO-MEDIATED SOIL IMPROVEMENT METHODS BY REPRODUCING RELEVANT MECHANICAL PROPERTIES WHILE ALLOWING COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES TO BE STUDIED IN DETAIL, BEFORE TESTING IN SOILS. IT IS ENVISAGED THAT AGAROSE GEL WILL BE USED INSTEAD OF SOIL WHEN DEVELOPING EARLY-STAGE PROTOTYPE METHODS, AS IT PROVIDES AN IDEAL ENVIRONMENT TO FACILITATE GROWTH AND MONITORING OF BACTERIA. A PROGRAMME OF GEOTECHNICAL TESTS AND SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY ON AGAROSE LOW MELT (LM) GEL IS PRESENTED. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE COMPARABLE PORE SIZE, UNDRAINED STRENGTH, AND PERMEABILITY TO SOFT CLAYS AND PEATS, BUT MORE LINEAR STRESS-STRAIN BEHAVIOUR AND HIGHER COMPRESSIBILITY. THIS PAPER OFFERS PROOF OF THIS NOVEL CONCEPT, BUT FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS REQUIRED AS ONLY A SINGLE TYPE OF AGAROSE, AT A SINGLE CONCENTRATION IS TESTED. BY VARYING THESE FACTORS, ALONG WITH USE OF DIFFERENT SOLVENTS, THERE IS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL TO TUNE THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE ANALOGUE TO PARTICULAR SOILS OR CONSTRUCTION SCENARIOS.","AGAROSE GEL AS A SOIL ANALOGUE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED BIO-MEDIATED SOIL IMPROVEMENT METHODS","CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL","ARTICLE","DEC",2020,"10.1139/cgj-2019-0496","ENGINEERING, GEOLOGICAL; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000592808100016"

HOWEVER, THE IMPORTANT SPLIT BETWEEN ARTIFICIAL DRAINAGE AND GROUNDWATER FLOWS AT A FIELD SITE IS USUALLY UNKNOWN. CONSEQUENTLY, THE EFFECTS THAT THE GROUNDWATER SYSTEM'S REDOX STATUS MAY HAVE ON THE FORMS AND TOTAL AMOUNTS OF NITROGEN (N) EXPORTED FROM THE SITE CANNOT BE CONFIDENTLY ASSESSED. WE ADDRESSED THESE DEFICIENCIES BY INVESTIGATING THE EXPORT OF VARIOUS FORMS OF N IN THE ARTIFICIAL DRAINAGE AND THE SHALLOW GROUNDWATER BENEATH TWO DAIRY FARMING SITES (TATUANUI, WAHAROA) WITHIN THE PIAKO RIVER CATCHMENT IN NEW ZEALAND. DUE TO THE VERY LOW HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY OF THE DEGRADED PEAT IN THE SATURATED ZONE PERCHED ON A CLAY AQUICLUDE, NO SIGNIFICANT WATER OR CONTAMINANTS WERE EXPORTED AT TATUANUI VIA THE UNCONFINED SHALLOW GROUNDWATER. ACCORDINGLY, ARTIFICIAL DRAINAGE DISCHARGE INTO THE RECEIVING SURFACE COLLECTOR DRAIN WAS THE ONLY EXPORT PATHWAY FOR N AT THIS SITE. THE SEALED NATURE OF THE GROUNDWATER ZONE RESULTED IN THE ACCUMULATION OF ORGANIC-N AND AMMONIUM-N IN THE PEATY SHALLOW SATURATED ZONE UNDERLYING THE MINERAL SOIL. IN CONTRAST, THE WAHAROA SITE FEATURED A MORE MOBILE SHALLOW GROUNDWATER SYSTEM, WHICH ON AVERAGE CONVEYED APPROXIMATELY EQUAL VOLUMES OF WATER OFFSITE AS THE ARTIFICIAL DRAINAGE SYSTEM. NITRATE (NO3-N) WAS AT BOTH SITES THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF N (76%) LEACHED FROM THE AEROBIC SOIL PROFILE AND DISCHARGED THROUGH THE ARTIFICIAL DRAINAGE. AS THE SHALLOW GROUNDWATER WAS AT BOTH SITES IN A REDUCED REDOX STATE, ANY NO3-N LEACHED FROM THE ROOTZONE INTO THE SATURATED ZONE WAS CONSUMED. ACCORDINGLY, EVEN THE MOBILE SHALLOW GROUNDWATER AT WAHAROA DID NOT CONVEY SIGNIFICANT NO3-N. THE NO3-N CONSUMPTION IN THE REDUCED GROUNDWATER PRESUMABLY OCCURRED DUE TO DISSIMILATORY NO3-N REDUCTION (CONCOMITANT INCREASES IN AMMONIUM-N CONCENTRATIONS, WITH NO ORGANIC MATERIAL AVAILABLE FOR MINERALISATION IN THE SATURATED ZONE) AND MICROBIAL DENITRIFICATION (PRODUCING GASEOUS FORMS OF N). THE NO3-N REDUCTIONS IN THE GROUNDWATER RESULTED IN THE AVERAGE TOTAL N EXPORTS VIA THE SHALLOW GROUNDWATER PATHWAY AT THE WAHAROA SITE BEING SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER (31% OF THE EXPORTED N) THAN IN THE ARTIFICIAL DRAINAGE (69%). THIS IS DESPITE BOTH PATHWAYS EXPORTING SIMILAR WATER VOLUMES. BECAUSE OF THE NO3-N CONSUMPTION IN THE REDUCED SHALLOW GROUNDWATER AT WAHAROA, OVER 98% OF THE N EXPORTED THROUGH THIS PATHWAY WAS EITHER AS AMMONIUM-N OR ORGANIC-N.","THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HYDROLOGICAL PATHWAYS IN EXPORTING NITROGEN FROM GRAZED ARTIFICIALLY DRAINED LAND","JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY","ARTICLE","JUN",2021,"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126218","ENGINEERING, CIVIL; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY; WATER RESOURCES","WOS:000652835600082"

DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS TYPICALLY DEMAND DIFFERENT TARGET GROUNDWATER LEVELS. ACHIEVING A SUITABLE COMPROMISE IS FACILITATED BY SOUND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE IMPACTS THAT WATER TABLES HAVE ON THE WATER BUDGET COMPONENTS. WE USED GROUNDWATER LYSIMETERS TO ANALYSE THE EFFECTS OF INCREASED TARGET GROUNDWATER LEVELS IN EARLY SPRING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WATER BUDGET COMPONENTS DURING THE VEGETATION PERIOD FROM APRIL TO SEPTEMBER. HIGHER WATER TABLES RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF EVAPOTRANSPIRATION. THE ADDITIONALLY STORED WATER BUFFERED THE EFFECT OF HIGHER EVAPOTRANSPIRATION - YET NOT FOR THE WHOLE VEGETATION PERIOD BUT ONLY FOR SOME WEEKS. VARIATIONS OF THE METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS DURING THE INVESTIGATION PERIOD FROM 2014 TO 2017, ESPECIALLY PERIODS WITH EXTREME PRECIPITATION, WERE MORE DECISIVE FOR THE WATER BUDGET AND WATER TABLE BEHAVIOUR THAN THE INCREASED SPRING TARGET GROUNDWATER LEVELS. HIGHER WATER TABLES LED IN THE MEDIUM AND LONG TERM TO CHANGES IN THE VEGETATION COMPOSITION. THE ALTERED VEGETATION AFFECTED THE HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WAS THE MAIN REASON WHY EVAPOTRANSPIRATION VALUES INCREASED.","A LYSIMETER STUDY ON THE IMPACTS OF DIFFERENT GROUNDWATER CONTROL REGIMES ON THE SOIL WATER BALANCE OF A SHALLOW WATER TABLE SITE","HYDROLOGIE UND WASSERBEWIRTSCHAFTUNG","ARTICLE","FEB",2019,"10.5675/HyWa_2019.1_1","WATER RESOURCES","WOS:000458715100002"

IN THIS PAPER, WE ANALYSED HOW THE WATER BUDGET COMPONENTS OF SUCH AREAS BEHAVED WHEN UNDERGOING RAINFALL EVENTS WITH AMOUNTS GREATER THAN 10 MM. ALL THE WATER BUDGET COMPONENTS WERE DETERMINED USING A WEIGHABLE GROUNDWATER LYSIMETER THAT WAS INSTALLED IN THE SPREEWALD WETLAND, GERMANY. ON AVERAGE, 69% OF THE RAINFALL WAS STORED IN THE WETLAND, WHILE ONLY 8% WAS DISCHARGED AND 23% WAS DISSIPATED BY EVAPOTRANSPIRATION DURING THE TIME OF THE RUNOFF PROCESS DURING AND AFTER THE RAINFALL EVENT. MORE THAN HALF OF THE WATER THAT WAS STORED COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO STORAGE WITHIN THE UNSATURATED ZONE, WHILE ONLY A MINOR PART WAS DUE TO THE WATER STORAGE CHANGE UNDER QUASI-EQUILIBRIUM CONDITIONS. HENCE, THE SOIL MOISTURE DEPLETION IN THE UNSATURATED ZONE IN THE PERIOD BEFORE THE RAINFALL HAD A BIG INFLUENCE ON THE SITE'S AVAILABLE WATER STORAGE CAPACITY. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT MODELS AND APPROACHES ASSUMING HYDROSTATIC CONDITIONS MIGHT STRONGLY UNDERESTIMATE THE WATER STORAGE CAPACITY OF SHALLOW WATER TABLE SITES AND, CONSEQUENTLY, OVERESTIMATE THE RUNOFF.

IN THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND, OUR MODELS WERE MORE SUCCESSFUL AND SUGGEST THAT HABITATS CHARACTERISED BY NATIVE CONIFEROUS FOREST AND AREAS WITH HIGH POTENTIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION REPRESENT THE MOST SUITABLE HABITAT FOR WHITE-FACED DARTER.

BECAUSE HYDROLOGY IS THE PRIMARY FACTOR INFLUENCING WETLAND STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION, THE IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THAT WETLANDS PROVIDE MAY BE ALTERED OR LOST AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WHILE A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECTED IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON WETLANDS, HYDROLOGIC MODELS AND DOWNSCALED CLIMATE MODEL PROJECTIONS PROVIDE TOOLS TO REDUCE THIS UNCERTAINTY. DRAINMOD IS ONE SUCH PROCESS-BASED HYDROLOGIC MODEL THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ADAPTED TO SIMULATE THE DAILY WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS IN NATURAL WETLANDS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT WAS TO DETERMINE THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE HYDROLOGIC REGIMES OF NON-RIVERINE, NON-TIDAL COASTAL PLAIN WETLANDS IN NORTH CAROLINA. DRAINMOD MODELS WERE CALIBRATED AND VALIDATED FOR TWO MINIMALLY DISTURBED, NATURAL WETLAND SITES USING OBSERVED WATER TABLE AND LOCAL WEATHER DATA. TWO REPRESENTATIVE CONCENTRATION PATHWAY (RCP) SCENARIOS WERE EVALUATED: RCP4.5 AND RCP8.5. NINE MODELS WERE SELECTED FROM AN ENSEMBLE OF 32 CLIMATE MODELS TO REPRESENT THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE CHANGES IN MEAN PRECIPITATION AND TEMPERATURE. DOWNSCALED CLIMATE PROJECTIONS WERE OBTAINED FROM THE U.S. BUREAU OF RECLAMATION. SIMULATIONS WERE RUN FROM 1986 TO 2099, AND RESULTS WERE EVALUATED BY COMPARING THE PROJECTED MEAN WATER TABLE LEVELS BETWEEN THE BASE PERIOD (1986-2015) AND TWO FUTURE EVALUATION PERIODS: 2040-2069 AND 2070-2099. THE MODEL SIMULATION RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE PROJECTED MEAN WATER TABLE LEVEL MAY DECLINE BY AS MUCH AS 25 TO 84 CM BY THE END OF THIS CENTURY (2070-2099) FOR THE RCP8.5 SCENARIO AND MAY DECLINE BY 4 TO 61 CM FOR THE RCP4.5 SCENARIO. IN COASTAL PLAIN WETLANDS, DECLINES IN WATER TABLES CAN LEAD TO THE SUBSIDENCE OF ORGANIC SOILS, WHICH CAN LEAD TO THE LOSS OF STORED CARBON AND INCREASED RISK OF PEAT FIRES. LOWER MEAN WATER LEVELS CAN ALSO LEAD TO SHIFTS IN VEGETATION COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND LOSS OF HABITAT FUNCTIONS FOR WETLAND-DEPENDENT FAUNA.

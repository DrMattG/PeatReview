WE EXAMINE VARIOUS DEFINITIONS AND ANALYTICAL APPROACHES AND SEEK TO PROVIDE A COMMON LANGUAGE. BC REPRESENTS A CONTINUUM FROM PARTLY CHARRED MATERIAL TO GRAPHITE AND SOOT PARTICLES, WITH NO GENERAL AGREEMENT ON CLEAR-CUT BOUNDARIES. FORMATION OF BC CAN OCCUR IN TWO FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT WAYS. VOLATILES RECONDENSE TO HIGHLY GRAPHITIZED SOOT-BC, WHEREAS THE SOLID RESIDUES FORM CHAR-BC. BOTH FORMS OF BC ARE RELATIVELY INERT AND ARE DISTRIBUTED GLOBALLY BY WATER AND WIND VIA FLUVIAL AND ATMOSPHERIC TRANSPORT. WE SUMMARIZE, CHRONOLOGICALLY, THE UBIQUITY OF BC IN SOILS AND SEDIMENTS SINCE DEVONIAN TIMES, DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN BC FROM VEGETATION FIRES AND FROM FOSSIL FUEL COMBUSTION. BC HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR VARIOUS BIOLOGICAL, GEOCHEMICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES. AS EXAMPLES, BC MAY REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT SINK IN THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE, AFFECT THE EARTH'S RADIATIVE HEAT BALANCE, BE A USEFUL TRACER FOR EARTH'S FIRE HISTORY, BUILD UP A SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF CARBON BURIED IN SOILS AND SEDIMENTS, AND CARRY ORGANIC POLLUTANTS. ON LAND, BC SEEMS TO BE ABUNDANT IN DARK-COLORED SOILS, AFFECTED BY FREQUENT VEGETATION BURNING AND FOSSIL FUEL COMBUSTION, THUS PROBABLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE HIGHLY STABLE AROMATIC COMPONENTS OF SOIL ORGANIC MATTER. WE DISCUSS CHALLENGES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. DESPITE THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF BC, ONLY LIMITED PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN CALIBRATING ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES. PROGRESS IN THE QUANTIFICATION OF BC IS LIKELY TO COME FROM SYSTEMATIC INTERCOMPARISON USING BCS FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES AND IN DIFFERENT NATURAL MATRICES. BC IDENTIFICATION COULD BENEFIT FROM ISOTOPIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC TECHNIQUES APPLIED AT THE BULK AND MOLECULAR LEVELS. THE KEY TO ESTIMATING BC STOCKS IN SOILS AND SEDIMENTS IS AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESSES INVOLVED IN BC DEGRADATION ON A MOLECULAR LEVEL. A PROMISING APPROACH WOULD BE THE COMBINATION OF SHORT-TERM LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS AND LONG-TERM FIELD TRIALS.","BLACK CARBON IN SOILS AND SEDIMENTS: ANALYSIS, DISTRIBUTION, IMPLICATIONS, AND CURRENT CHALLENGES","GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES","REVIEW","SEP",2000,"10.1029/1999GB001208","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY; METEOROLOGY & ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES","WOS:000089089000006"

THIS DRAINAGE HAS BEEN IN RESPONSE TO AGRICULTURAL DEMAND, FORESTRY, HORTICULTURAL AND ENERGY PROPERTIES OF PEAT AND ALLEVIATION OF FLOOD RISK. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SEVERAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH DRAINAGE OF PEATLANDS. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THESE PROBLEMS AND EXAMINES THE EVIDENCE FOR CHANGES IN HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE CHANGES. TRADITIONAL BLACK-BOX WATER BALANCE APPROACHES DEMONSTRATE LITTLE ABOUT WETLAND DYNAMICS AND THEREFORE THE SCIENCE OF CATCHMENT RESPONSE TO PEAT DRAINAGE IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. IT IS CRUCIAL THAT A MORE PROCESS-BASED APPROACH BE ADOPTED WITHIN PEATLAND ECOSYSTEMS. THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH PEAT DRAINAGE HAVE LED, IN PART, TO A RECENT REVERSAL IN ATTITUDES TO PEATLANDS AND WE HAVE SEEN A MOVE TOWARDS WETLAND RESTORATION. HOWEVER, A DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF HYDROLOGICAL, HYDROCHEMICAL AND ECOLOGICAL PROCESS-INTERACTIONS WILL BE FUNDAMENTAL IF WE ARE TO ADEQUATELY RESTORE DEGRADED PEATLANDS, PRESERVE THOSE THAT ARE STILL INTACT AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF SUCH MANAGEMENT ACTIONS AT THE CATCHMENT SCALE.","ARTIFICIAL DRAINAGE OF PEATLANDS: HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL PROCESS AND WETLAND RESTORATION","PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT","REVIEW","MAR",2004,"10.1191/0309133304pp403ra","GEOGRAPHY, PHYSICAL; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000189265500004"

THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE KEY MECHANISMS OF PEATLAND CH4 PRODUCTION, CONSUMPTION AND TRANSPORT AND THE MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND BIOTIC CONTROLS ON PEATLAND CH4 EMISSIONS. THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF MICROMETEOROLOGICAL AND CHAMBER METHODS IN MEASURING CH4 FLUXES FROM NORTHERN PEATLANDS ARE ALSO DISCUSSED. THE MAGNITUDE OF CH4 FLUX VARIES CONSIDERABLY AMONG PEATLAND TYPES (BOGS AND FENS) AND MICROTOPOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS (HUMMOCKS AND HOLLOWS).

IN THIS SHORT REVIEW, WE PRESENT RECENT EVIDENCE THAT THIS VIEW IS INVALID. THE STABILITY OF DOM FROM FOREST FLOOR HORIZONS, PEATS, AND TOPSOILS AGAINST MICROBIAL DEGRADATION INCREASES WITH ADVANCED DECOMPOSITION OF THE PARENT ORGANIC MATTER (OM). AROMATIC COMPOUNDS, DERIVING FROM LIGNIN, LIKELY ARE THE MOST STABLE COMPONENTS OF DOM WHILE PLANT-DERIVED CARBOHYDRATES SEEM EASILY DEGRADABLE. CARBOHYDRATES AND N-RICH COMPOUNDS OF MICROBIAL ORIGIN PRODUCED DURING THE DEGRADATION OF DOM CAN BE RELATIVELY STABLE. SUCH COMPONENTS CONTRIBUTE MUCH TO DOM IN THE MINERAL SUBSOIL. SORPTION OF DOM TO SOIL MINERALS AND (CO-)PRECIPITATION WITH AL (AND PROBABLY ALSO WITH FE), ESPECIALLY OF THE INHERENTLY STABLE AROMATIC MOIETIES, RESULT IN DISTINCT STABILIZATION. IN LABORATORY INCUBATION EXPERIMENTS, THE MEAN RESIDENCE TIME OF DOM FROM THE OA HORIZON OF A HAPLIC PODZOL INCREASED FROM <30 Y IN SOLUTION TO >90 Y AFTER SORPTION TO A SUBSOIL. WE COMBINED DOM FLUXES AND MINERALIZATION RATE CONSTANTS FOR DOM SORBED TO MINERALS AND A SUBSOIL HORIZON, AND (CO-) PRECIPITATED WITH AL TO ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION OF DOM TO TOTAL C IN THE MINERAL SOIL OF A HAPLIC PODZOL IN GERMANY. THE CONTRIBUTION OF ROOTS TO DOM WAS NOT CONSIDERED BECAUSE OF LACK OF DATA. THE DOM-DERIVED SOIL C RANGES FROM 20 TO 55 MG HA(-1) IN THE MINERAL SOIL, WHICH REPRESENTS 19%-50% OF THE TOTAL SOIL C. THE VARIATION OF THE ESTIMATE REFLECTS THE VARIATION IN MINERALIZATION RATE CONSTANTS OBTAINED FOR SORBED AND (CO-) PRECIPITATED DOM. NEVERTHELESS, THE ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT DOM CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE ACCUMULATION OF STABLE OM IN SOIL. A MORE PRECISE ESTIMATION OF DOM-DERIVED C IN SOILS REQUIRES MINERALIZATION RATE CONSTANTS FOR DOM SORBED TO ALL RELEVANT MINERALS OR (CO-)PRECIPITATED WITH FE.

ON THE BASIS OF STUDIES OF LAKE SEDIMENTS, MODERN ATMOSPHERIC MERCURY DEPOSITION RATES ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE INCREASED BY A FACTOR OF 3-5 COMPARED TO BACKGROUND VALUES: I.E., FROM ABOUT 3-3.5 MU G HG M(-2) YR(-1) TO 10-20 MU G HG M-2 YR(-1). HOWEVER, RECENT STUDIES OF THE HISTORICAL MERCURY RECORD IN PEAT BOGS SUGGEST SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER INCREASES (9-400 FOLD, MEDIAN 40X), I.E., FROM ABOUT 0.6-1.7 MU G HG M(-2) YR(-1) TO 8-184 MU G HG M(-2) YR(-1). WE COMPARED PUBLISHED DATA OF BACKGROUND AND MODERN MERCURY ACCUMULATION RATES DERIVED FROM GLOBALLY DISTRIBUTED LAKE SEDIMENTS AND PEAT BOGS AND DISCUSS REASONS FOR THE DIFFERENCES OBSERVED IN ABSOLUTE VALUES AND IN THE RELATIVE INCREASE IN THE INDUSTRIAL AGE. DIRECT MEASUREMENTS OF MODERN WET MERCURY DEPOSITION RATES IN REMOTE AREAS ARE PRESENTLY ABOUT 1-4,MU G M(-2) YR(-1), BUT WERE POSSIBLY AS HIGH AS 20 MU G HG M(-2) YR(-1) DURING THE 1980S. THESE VALUES ARE CLOSER TO THE ESTIMATES OF PAST DEPOSITION DETERMINED FROM LAKE SEDIMENTS, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT MODERN MERCURY ACCUMULATION RATES DERIVED FROM PEAT BOGS TEND TO OVERESTIMATE DEPOSITION. WE SUGGEST THAT SMEARING OF PB-210 IN THE UPPERMOST PEAT SECTIONS CONTRIBUTES TO AN UNDERESTIMATION OF PEAT AGES, WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON FOR THE OVERESTIMATION OF MERCURY ACCUMULATION RATES IN MANY BOGS. THE LOWER BACKGROUND MERCURY ACCUMULATION RATES IN PEAT AS COMPARED TO LAKE SEDIMENTS WE BELIEVE IS THE RESULT OF NONQUANTITATIVE RETENTION AND LOSS OF MERCURY DURING PEAT DIAGENESIS. AS MANY PROCESSES CONTROLLING TIME-RESOLVED MERCURY ACCUMULATION IN MIRES ARE STILL POORLY UNDERSTOOD, LAKE SEDIMENTS APPEAR TO BE THE MORE RELIABLE ARCHIVE FOR ESTIMATING HISTORICAL MERCURY ACCUMULATION RATES.","MODELING THE PAST ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION OF MERCURY USING NATURAL ARCHIVES","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY","REVIEW","JUL 15",2007,"10.1021/es0704232","ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000248363100009"
"7","MOORE PD, 2002, ENVIRON CONSERV","MOORE PD","THE TEMPERATE PEATLANDS ARE EXTENSIVE, COVERING AROUND 3.5 MILLION KM(2) OF LAND. THEY CONTAIN ABOUT 455 GT OF CARBON, ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO THE CARBON STORED IN ALL OF THE LIVING THINGS ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET, AND REPRESENTING AROUND 25% OF ALL THE SOIL CARBON ON EARTH. THESE BOGS ARE A SINK FOR ATMOSPHERIC CARBON AND THEIR CARBON UPTAKE ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 12% OF CURRENT HUMAN EMISSIONS. THEY VARY CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR FORM AND STRUCTURE AND ARE AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, INCLUDING THE STUDY OF PAST ENVIRONMENTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THEY ARE ALSO VALUABLE IN ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION. THEY ARE LOW IN BIODIVERSITY, BUT THEIR FAUNA AND FLORA ARE DISTINCTIVE AND MANY GROUPS ARE CONFINED TO THIS HABITAT. FOR ALL THESE REASONS, THE FUTURE CONSERVATION OF PEATLANDS IS A MATTER FOR CONCERN. THREATS TO PEATLANDS COME FROM DIRECT HUMAN EXPLOITATION IN THE FORM OF PEAT HARVESTING FOR ENERGY AND HORTICULTURE, AND DRAINAGE FOR FORESTRY. RISING ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS SHOULD CONTROL BOTH OF THESE PROCESSES IN THE WESTERN WORLD, BUT CONTINUED NORTHERN PEATLAND LOSSES ARE LIKELY LOCALLY, ESPECIALLY IN ASIA. PEATLAND DRAINAGE FOR FORESTRY OR AGRICULTURE WILL RESULT IN LOSSES OF CARBON TO THE ATMOSPHERE, ADDING TO THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT. HUMAN POPULATION PRESSURES, INDUSTRIALIZATION AND URBANIZATION ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE INFLUENCE IN THE BOREAL ZONE. FRAGMENTATION OF THE HABITAT IS NOT AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION BECAUSE BOGS ARE BY THEIR VERY NATURE 'ISLAND' HABITATS. ACIDIFICATION BY AERIAL POLLUTION MAY BE A LOCAL PROBLEM CLOSE TO SOURCES, BUT THE HABITAT IS NATURALLY ACID AND SHOULD NOT BE SEVERELY AFFECTED, THE INPUT OF AERIAL NUTRIENTS, HOWEVER, PARTICULARLY NITROGEN, COULD HAVE WIDESPREAD IMPACT ON BOGS, ENHANCING THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND ALTERING THEIR VEGETATION COMPOSITION. THE PHYSICAL REHABILITATION OF BOGS DAMAGED BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES PRESENTS MANY PROBLEMS, PARTICULARLY RELATING TO THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF PEAT STRUCTURE AND VEGETATION, BUT THE PROCESS CAN RESULT IN THE RE-FORMATION OF A CARBON SINK SO IT IS WORTH THE EFFORT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN ITS IMPACT ON BOGS. HIGHER TEMPERATURE (ESPECIALLY IF ACCOMPANIED BY RAISED ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS AND INCREASED NITRATE DEPOSITION) WILL ENHANCE PRODUCTIVITY, BUT WILL ALSO RESULT IN FASTER DECOMPOSITION RATES. THE OUTCOME OF THESE OPPOSING FACTORS FOR PEAT FORMATION WILL ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON THE FUTURE PATTERN OF PRECIPITATION. IF, AS SEEMS MOST LIKELY, SUMMER CONDITIONS BECOME WARMER AND DRIER IN CONTINENTAL REGIONS AND WINTERS BECOME MILDER AND WETTER, THE SUMMER DROUGHT COULD CAUSE PEAT LOSS AND BOG CONTRACTION. AN EXCESS OF DECOMPOSITION WILL LEAD TO BOGS BECOMING A CARBON SOURCE AND THUS A POSITIVE FEEDBACK IN GLOBAL WARMING. EMISSIONS OF METHANE AND NITROUS OXIDE WOULD ADD TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS PROBLEM, BUT LIKELY OXIDATION OF METHANE AND LOW N2O PRODUCTION MAY WELL MEAN THAT THIS IMPACT WILL NOT PROVE TO BE SIGNIFICANT. TREE INVASION OF BOGS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUMMER DROUGHT COULD LOCALLY LEAD TO INCREASED WATER LOSS THROUGH TRANSPIRATION, AND HIGHER HEAT ABSORPTION THROUGH ALBEDO CHANGE. THIS WILL ENHANCE THE DRYING EFFECT ON THE BOG SURFACE. OCEANIC MIRES WILL BE LESS SEVERELY AFFECTED IF THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN PRECIPITATION TAKES PLACE IN THESE REGIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT OVERALL FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE FUTURE OF THE NORTHERN BOGS IS LIKELY TO BE THE QUANTITY AND PATTERN (BOTH SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY) OF FUTURE PRECIPITATION IN THE ZONE.","THE FUTURE OF COOL TEMPERATE BOGS","ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION","REVIEW","MAR",2002,"10.1017/S0376892902000024","BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000175924000002"

IN GENERAL, A COMBINATION OF TOPSOIL REMOVAL AND SEED TRANSFER IS AN EFFECTIVE MEASURE FOR FEN MEADOW RESTORATION, PROVIDED THAT GROUNDWATER SEEPAGE CAN BE RE-ESTABLISHED. THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL BIOTIC LIMITATIONS TO FEN MEADOW RESTORATION, DUE TO LIMITED PROPAGULE AVAILABILITY OF TARGET SPECIES AND THE LEGACY OF THE FORMER VEGETATION IN FORM OF ITS SOIL SEED BANK AND HIGH SEED PRODUCTION BY UNWANTED SPECIES. UNDER THE PRESENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, THE RE-DEVELOPMENT OF FEN MEADOWS ON DEGRADED FENS WILL RESULT IN SPECIES COMPOSITIONS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OBSERVED IN THE PAST AND SUCH RESTORATION MAY REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE TIME AND EFFORT.

THE CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PEAT TOGETHER WITH ITS ACCUMULATION AND DECAY PROCESSES HAVE BEEN ANALYSED. PEAT IS AN ACIDIC MIXTURE OF DEAD AND DECOMPOSED. MAINLY VEGETABLE, MATTER FORMED IN BOGGY AREAS; IT IS THE YOUNGEST AND LEAST ALTERED COMPONENT OF THE COMBUSTIBLE ROCKS AND IS CHARACTERISED BY THE LOWEST CONTENT OF FIXED CARBON AND THE HIGHEST CONTENT OF VOLATILE CONSTITUENTS. PEAT IS FORMED BY DEGENERATION PROCESSES UNDER EXCLUSION OF ATMOSPHERIC OXYGEN BY THE ACTION OF WATER; THE SPEED OF FORMATION DEPENDS UPON THE CLIMATIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. IN MOST PEATLANDS TWO LAYERS CAN BE CHARACTERISED: THE AEROBIC ACROTELM AND THE ANAEROBIC CATOTELM, THEIR RELATIVE IMPORTANCE BEING CONTROLLED MAINLY BY THE POSITION OF THE WATER TABLE. IN THE ACROTELM THE AEROBIC PROCESSES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOSS OF UP TO 90% OF THE ORIGINAL MASS, DEGENERATION IN THE ACIDIC AND ANAEROBIC CATOTELM IS STILL IMPERFECTLY CHARACTERISED EVEN THOUGH THE CATOTELM IS THE REAL SITE OF PEAT ACCUMULATION. MOST OF THE RECENT LITERATURE CONSIDERS PEAT AS COMPOSED OF EASILY DEGRADABLE COMPOUNDS, E.G. POLYSACCHARIDES. AND RECALCITRANT MATTER (LIGNIN AND COMPLEX AROMATICS). THE LONE-TERM DESTINY OF PEAT HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY CHARACTERISED: ALTHOUGH IN A LARGE MAJORITY OF CASES IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT PEAT DECOMPOSES COMPLETELY (EVEN THOUGH SLOWLY) PROVIDED THAT IT IS GIVEN A SUFFICIENTLY LONG RESIDENCE RIME IN THE CATOTELM, SOME CASES CAN STILL BE INTERPRETED AS EXAMPLES OF SIMPLE ACCUMULATION. THE RATES OF INFLUX OF OXYGEN AND HENCE THE DEGRADATION OF ORGANIC MATTER INTO BOTH SATURATED AND PARTIALLY SATURATED PEAT HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED. THE DEPLETION RATE IS ABOUT 4500 G M(-1) YEAR(-1) FOR PARTIALLY SATURATED PEAT. THE AVERAGE DEPLETION RATE OF THE PEAT FOR THIS CASE WILL THEN BE SUCH THAT IT WILL TAKE ON THE ORDER OF 5 TO 50 YEARS TO DEGRADE HALF OF THE ORGANICS IN A 10 CM PARTIALLY SATURATED LAYER. FOR THE WATER-SATURATED CASE THE DEPLETION RATE VARIES BETWEEN 8 AND 12 G M(-2) YEAR(-1), WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN IN THE PARTIALLY SATURATED REGION. THE MODELS USED TO ANALYSE THE FIELD AND LABORATORY DATA ON GENERATION, DIFFUSION AND EMISSION OF METHANE AND CARBON DIOXIDE INDICATE THAT LABORATORY DATA AND FIELD OBSERVATIONS AGREE REASONABLY WELL. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT PEAT-ACCUMULATING ECOSYSTEMS MAY BE VALUABLE NATURAL ANALOGUES FOR THE STUDY OF THE LONG-TERM DESTINY OF INDUSTRIAL AND MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTES.

A RECENT MANAGEMENT TREND FOR DRAINED PEATLANDS IS THE CONTROL OF GREENHOUSE GASES (GHG) BY CHANGES IN AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES, PEATLAND RESTORATION OR PALUDICULTURE. DUE TO COMPLEX ANTAGONISTIC CONTROLS OF MOISTURE, WATER TABLE MANAGEMENT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO USE AS A METHOD FOR CONTROLLING GHG EMISSIONS. PAST STUDIES SHOW THAT THERE IS NO OBVIOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GHG EMISSION RATES AND CROP TYPE, TILLAGE INTENSITY OR FERTILIZATION RATES. FOR DRAINED PEAT SOILS, THE BEST USE OPTIONS CAN VARY FROM REWETTING WITH REDUCED EMISSION TO EFFICIENT SHORT TERM USE TO MAXIMIZE THE, PROFIT PER AMOUNT OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMITTED. THE GHG ACCOUNTING SHOULD CONSIDER THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE OF THE PEATLAND AND THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC BENEFITS PEATLANDS PROVIDE LOCALLY. CULTIVATING ENERGY CROPS IS A VIABLE OPTION ESPECIALLY FOR WET PEAT SOILS WITH POOR DRAINAGE, BUT HARVESTING REMAINS A CHALLENGE DUE TO TRACTABILITY OF WET SOILS. PALUDICULTURE IN LOWLAND FLOODPLAINS CAN BE A TOOL TO MITIGATE REGIONAL FLOODING ALLOWING WATER TO BE STORED ON THESE LANDS WITHOUT MUCH HARM TO CROPS. THIS CAN ALSO INCREASE REGIONAL BIODIVERSITY PROVIDING IMPORTANT HABITATS FOR BIRDS AND MOISTURE TOLERANT PLANT SPECIES. HOWEVER, ON MANY PEATLANDS REWETTING IS NOT POSSIBLE DUE TO THEIR POSITION IN THE LANDSCAPE AND THE ASSOCIATED DIFFICULTY TO MAINTAIN A HIGH STABLE WATER TABLE. WHILE THE GOAL OF REWETTING OFTEN IS TO ENCOURAGE THE RETURN OF PEAT FORMING PLANTS AND THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THEY PROVIDE SUCH AS CARBON SEQUESTRATION, IT IS NOT WELL KNOWN IF THESE PLANTS WILL GROW ON PEAT SOILS THAT HAVE BEEN ALTERED BY THE PROCESS OF DRAINAGE AND MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER PEAT QUALITY AND HYDROLOGY WHEN CHOOSING MANAGEMENT OPTIONS. MAPPING OF SITES IS RECOMMENDED AS A MANAGEMENT TOOL TO GUIDE ACTIONS. THE ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THE SITES SHOULD BE ASSESSED BOTH FOR CONTINUED CULTIVATION BUT ALSO FOR OTHER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES SUCH AS RESTORATION AND HYDROLOGICAL FUNCTIONS (FLOOD CONTROL). FARMERS NEED ADVICE, TOOLS AND TRAINING TO FIND THE BEST AFTER-USE OPTION. BIOFUELS MIGHT PROVIDE A COST-EFFICIENT AFTER USE OPTION FOR SOME SITES. PEAT EXTRACTION FOLLOWED BY REWETTING MIGHT PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE OPTION AS REWETTING IS OFTEN EASIER IF THE PEAT IS REMOVED, STARTING THE PEAT ACCUMULATION FROM SCRATCH. ALSO THIS PROVIDES A WAY TO FINANCE THE AFTER-USE. AS IMPACTS OF LAND USE ARE UNCERTAIN, NEW POLICIES SHOULD CONSIDER MULTIPLE BENEFITS AND DECISIONS SHOULD BE BASED ON SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND FIELD SCALE OBSERVATIONS. THE NEED TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND THE KEY PROCESSES AND LONG TERM EFFECTS OF FIELD SCALE LAND USE MANIPULATIONS IS EVIDENT.

IT EXPANDS ON THE QUALITATIVE CONSIDERATIONS OF PATTERNS OF ENERGY FLOW AND NUTRIENT CYCLING PRESENTED IN THAT PAPER, BY PROVIDING QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION FROM SUBSEQUENT RESEARCH AT THE ISLAND. PRIMARY PRODUCTION OF THE ISLAND'S LOWLAND PLANT COMMUNITIES IS HIGH ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, BECAUSE THE VEGETATION HAS A LONG GROWING SEASON DUE TO THE LACK OF SEVERELY COLD WINTERS OR DROUGHT. DAILY PRODUCTIVITY IS ACTUALLY LOW DUE TO LOW RADIATION LEVELS AND A COOL GROWING SEASON. THE VEGETATION IS PARTICULARLY EFFICIENT REGARDING ITS USE OF NUTRIENTS FOR ITS GROWTH, BUT STILL REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF NUTRIENTS TO SUPPORT THE HIGH ANNUAL PRODUCTION. SEABIRDS AND SEALS IMPORT LARGE QUANTITIES OF NUTRIENTS FROM THE OCEAN WHEN THEY BREED AND MOULT ON THE ISLAND. THEY MARKEDLY ENHANCE SOIL AND PLANT NUTRIENT STATUS IN THE AREAS IN WHICH THEY OCCUR, AND ALSO IN ADJACENT AREAS. HOWEVER, BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF THE ISLAND'S INLAND VEGETATION IS NOT DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY BIRDS OR SEALS AND MOST OF THE NUTRIENTS REQUIRED FOR PLANT GROWTH ARE PROVIDED BY DECOMPOSITION OF PLANT LITTER AND PEAT. SOIL INVERTEBRATES ARE CRUCIAL FACILITATORS OF DECOMPOSITION PROCESSES, WHICH ARE OTHERWISE RESTRICTED BY LOW SOIL TEMPERATURES AND HIGH SOIL MOISTURE CONTENTS. INTRODUCED HOUSE MICE HAVE INVADED ALMOST ALL PARTS OF THE ISLAND AND PREDATE HEAVILY ON THE INVERTEBRATES, THUS AFFECTING NUTRIENT MINERALISATION. THIS THREATENS NOT ONLY THE FUNCTIONING (LOWERED NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY LEADING TO SLOWER PLANT GROWTH AND THE PRODUCTION OF A LOWER QUALITY, MORE DECOMPOSITION-RECALCITRANT PLANT LITTER), BUT ALSO THE STRUCTURE (AN ALTERED BALANCE BETWEEN PRODUCTION AND DECOMPOSITION LEADS TO A CHANGE IN THE RELATION BETWEEN PEAT FORMATION AND DEGRADATION, WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF VEGETATION SUCCESSION) OF THE ISLAND'S ECOSYSTEM. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT MICE MAY ALSO AFFECT THE ISLAND'S ECOLOGY BY PREDATING ON SEABIRD CHICKS.","ENERGY FLOW AND NUTRIENT CYCLING IN THE MARION ISLAND TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEM: 30 YEARS ON","POLAR RECORD","REVIEW","JUL",2008,"10.1017/S0032247407007218","ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000257222300002"

OF OBSERVED PALYNOFLORA, 88-97% ARE FROM LYCOPSIDS PREVALENT IN THE WESTPHALIAN. DENSOSPORITES PALYNOMORPHS OF SMALL LYCOPSIDS (E.G., OMPHALOPHLOIOS) DOMINATE AT THE SHALE-HOSTED ARMFIELD SITE, WHILE LYCOSPORA PALYNOFLORA OF LARGE ARBOREOUS LYCOPSIDS (ESPECIALLY LEPIDODENDRON, WITH LESSER LEPIDOPHLOIOS HARCOURTII AND LEPIDOPHLOIOS HALLII) DOMINATE WHERE INTERCALATED SILTSTONE/SANDSTONE/SHALE HOSTS THE COAL (ALL OTHER SITES). PALYNOFLORA OF OTHER LYCOPSIDS (SIGILLARIA AND PARALYCOPODITES), TREE FERNS, SEED FERNS, SMALL FERNS, CALAMITES, AND CORDAITES ARE GENERALLY MINOR. GENERA OF ELASTIC-ASSOCIATED PARALYCOPODITES ARE MOST COMMON IN SHAKERAG'S COAL (>= 10%), YET QUITE RARE IN RUTLEDGE OR DOTSON COALS. OVERALL, THE PALYNOMORPH ASSEMBLAGES SUGGEST THAT THE BON AIR PALEOMIRES WERE FOREST SWAMPS, AND EARLY PENNSYLVANIAN IN AGE (WESTPHALIAN A, LANGSETTIAN). DOMINANT MACERALS AT ALL SITES ARE VITRINITES, WITH FINE COLLODETRINITE (FROM STRONGLY DECOMPOSED PLANT DEBRIS) MORE COMMON THAN COARSER COLLOTELINITE (FROM WELL-PRESERVED PLANT FRAGMENTS), AND WITH LESSER INERTINITES (FUSINITE AND SEMIFUSINITE) AND LIPTINITES (DOMINANTLY SPORINITE). SHAKERAG'S COAL HAS GREATEST ABUNDANCE (MINERAL-MATTER-FREE) OF COLLOTELINITE (UP TO 47%) AND TOTAL VITRINITE (74-79%) OF ANY SITES, BUT LOWEST LIPTINITE (12-14.5%) AND INERTINITE (7-11%). THE DOTSON AND RUTLEDGE SEAMS CONTAIN MODERATE LIPTINITE (21-23%) AND HIGHEST INERTINITE (36-37%), LOWEST VITRINITE (<= 41%), AND LOWEST COLLOTELINITE (13-15%). ARMFIELD'S SEAM HAS RELATIVELY HIGH LIPTINITE (26-28%) AND VITRINITE (56.5-62%), BUT RATHER LOW INERTINITE (12-15%). MODERATELY HIGH ASH (11.0-20.0%) AND LOW TO MODERATE SULFUR (1.24% AVG.)

THESE INCLUDE VARIABLE INERTINITE, COMMON PALYNOFLORA OF BOTH SMALL LYCOPSIDS (OMPHALOPHLOIOS-LIKE) AND LARGE ARBOREOUS ONES (LEPIDOPHLOIOS AND LEPIDODENDRON), MINOR BUT SIGNIFICANT PALYNOFLORA OF SUBAERIAL LEVEE OR LEVEE/MIRE TRANSITION SPECIES (ESPECIALLY PARALYCOPODITES), MODERATE TO HIGH ASH, VARIABLE SULFUR, AND ELEVATED LEVELS OF COMMONLY FLUVIAL TRACE ELEMENTS (E.G., AL, CR, REES, RB, SR, TH, V, Y, AND ZR).

BY CONTRAST, MIDDLE BENCHES AT ARMFIELD REFLECT MIRES DOMED ABOVE THE LAND SURFACE, LESS-OFTEN FLOODED, LESS-PRESERVATIONAL, AND OF LOWER PH: COALS HAVE LOWER ASH, VITRINITE, AND COLLOTELINITE, LESS PALYNOFLORA OF BOTH LARGE ARBOREOUS LYCOPSIDS AND PARALYCOPODITES, AND HIGH PROPORTIONS OF KAOLINITE, LIPTINITE, AND DENSOSPORITES.

STYGIA ARE VERY SIMILAR AND INCLUDE VERY SHALLOW DYSTROPHIC WATERS (0-30 CM DEEP) WITH HIGHLY VARIABLE LEVELS OF DYSTROPHY, COMMON MILD WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS, OLIGOMESOTROPHIC TO SLIGHLY EUTROPHIC WATERS, OPTIMAL PH VALUES FROM 5.5 TO 7.0 BUT ALWAYS HIGH FREE-CO2 CONCENTRATIONS OF 0.8-1.5 MM. LIMITED DATA INDICATE THAT U. BREMII IS PARTLY A STENOTOPIC SPECIES PREFERRING ONLY SLIGHTLY ACIDIC TO NEUTRAL (PH 6-7), VERY SOFT TO SLIGHTLY HARD, OLIGO-MESOTROPHIC WATERS. YET IT CAN GROW WELL BOTH IN STRONGLY DYSTROPHIC AND CLEAR WATERS, IN PEAT BOGS AS WELL AS SAND-PITS OVER PEATY SOIL AND CLAYISH SAND. LONGTERM, VERY LOW WATER LEVELS IN COMBINATION WITH HABITAT EUTROPHICATION, WHATEVER THE REASON, LEADING TO PEAT BOG AND FEN INFILLING, ARE THE MOST COMMON AND UNFAVOURABLE ECOLOGICAL THREADS AT THE MOST SITES OF THE FOUR RARE UTRICULARIA SPECIES. HOWEVER, ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF HIGH-WATER LEVEL AT THE SITES CAN BE AMBIGUOUS FOR THE POPULATIONS: IT REDUCES THE STRONGLY COMPETITIVE CYPEROID AND GRAMINOID SPECIES BUT CAN SPEED UP SITE EUTROPHICATION. ALL FOUR SPECIES ARE CONSIDERED (CRITICALLY) THREATENED IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND ARE USUALLY UNDER OFFICIAL SPECIES PROTECTION OR THEIR SITES ARE PROTECTED. REGENERATION OF INFILLED FENS OR PEAT BOGS AND CREATION OF SHALLOW FEN POOLS AND CANALS IN THESE MIRES, COMBINED WITH (RE)-INTRODUCTIONS OF THESE SPECIES HAVE SHOWN TO BE A VERY SUCCESSFUL AND EFFICIENT MEASURE TO PROTECT THE NATURAL POPULATIONS FOR MANY DECADES. OLD SHALLOW SAND-PIT POOLS HAVE BECOME OUTSTANDING SUBSTITUTION HABITATS FOR THE PROTECTION OF U. BREMII.","BIOLOGICAL FLORA OF CENTRAL EUROPE: UTRICULARIA INTERMEDIA HAYNE, U.

PEAT WAS USED EXTERNALLY (AS POULTICES) IN THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY. THE PEAT PREPARATION INVENTED BY STANISLAW TOLPA (TOLPA PEAT PREPARATION, TPP) WAS PATENTED IN POLAND IN 1991; ITS CONCEPT HAD EMERGED IN THE 1980S. IT RAISED HIGH THERAPEUTIC EXPECTATIONS STILL BEING RESEARCHED IN THE EARLY 1990S. PROFOUND EXPECTATIONS FOR PEAT, A NATURAL PRODUCT WELL KNOWN IN CENTRAL EUROPEAN (AND POLISH) SPAS (FOR MEDICATED BATHS AND POULTICES), EARNED TOLPA'S PREPARATION GREAT RENOWN BEFORE ANY ACTUAL BENEFITS (INTERNAL ACTIONS) WERE SCIENTIFICALLY CONFIRMED. AIM OF THE REVIEW: WE STUDY THE ORIGINS OF MEDICAL INTEREST IN PEAT IN POLISH SCIENCE AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE HISTORICAL ETHNOPHARMACY OF PEAT AND SPHAGNUM MOSS IN CENTRAL EUROPE. IT IS AIMED AT SHEDDING A NEW LIGHT ON THE HISTORY OF TPP, ITS CONNECTIONS WITH LOCAL ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL TRADITIONS AND INSPIRATIONS FOR LOCAL MEDICAL STUDIES ON PEAT PRODUCTS AND PEAT-DERIVED DRUGS OF THE 1980S AND EARLY 1900S. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE LITERATURE ON PEAT BATHS WAS FOUND AND REVIEWED INCLUDING THE INFORMATION AND DATA ABOUT THE STUDIES OF TPP FROM PUBLISHED THOUGH UNKNOWN SOURCES AS WELL AS FROM POLISH PATENTS, UNPUBLISHED TYPESCRIPTS, PRESS INTERVIEWS AND REPORTS. RESULTS: TOLPA'S RESEARCH TEAM MISSED THE HISTORICAL DATA ABOUT EXTERNAL AND TOPICAL ACTIONS OF SPHAGNUM PEAT OR ITS PREPARATIONS WHICH WERE PUBLISHED IN THE 19TH- AND EARLY 20TH-CENTURY. THIS IS STRANGE BECAUSE FOLK MEDICINE BASED ON PEAT EMANATED EASTWARDS FROM ETHNIC AUSTRIA ALONG THE VISTULA RIVER AND THE CARPATHIANS. TOLPA IGNORED BALNEOTHERAPEUTIC (EXTERNAL) APPLICATIONS AS WELL AS THE ACTION OF SPHAGNAN FROM SPHAGNUM HERB, AND REJECTED THIS KIND OF PEAT AS SCIENTIFICALLY NOT PROMISING, BASED ON A SINGLE BIOLOGICAL TEST ON PLANTS. THE CONCEPT OF AN ACTIVE PRINCIPLE IN PEAT OR ITS PREPARATIONS EVOLVED, AND SPECULATION CONCERNING ITS NATURE WAS NOT FOLLOWED BY ADEQUATE BASIC RESEARCH. THE ACTIVE PRINCIPLE WAS NOT FOUND. RESULTS CONCERNING PLANT MERISTEM GROWTH WERE TOO READILY APPLIED IN ANIMAL PRODUCTION AND FINALLY HUMAN MEDICINE. THE NATURAL INGREDIENT IN TPP PRODUCTION WAS NEVER DEFINED BOTANICALLY. ANTI-CANCER PROPERTIES ASCRIBED TO THE TPP ON THE BASIS OF BIO-STIMULATION TESTS STIRRED POWERFUL SOCIAL EMOTIONS. CONCLUSIONS: TOPICAL PEAT CURE ORIGINATED IN AUSTRIA IN ABOUT 1820. IT EVOLVED AS A WHOLE BRANCH OF CENTRAL EUROPEAN BALNEOTHERAPY WHICH HAD BEEN COMPLETELY SCIENTIFICALLY DESCRIBED BY THE 1950S. AT THAT TIME AN UNDEFINED PEAT EXTRACT WAS ONCE SUCCESSFULLY USED IN EAR INFECTIONS IN PAEDIATRICS. STANISLAW TOLPA'S RESEARCH PROJECT TO FIND ANY INTERNAL APPLICATION OF PEAT IGNORED THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF ETHNOBIOLOGY, BALNEOTHERAPY, SURGERY AND OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY KNOWN AT THAT TIME. HIS STRENUOUS AND INSISTENT EFFORTS, CARRIED OUT IN ISOLATION, CRUCIALLY FAILED PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL TESTS IN ANY BRANCH OF HIS THERAPY. THREE COMMERCIAL DRUGS WERE ALLOWED FOR 3 YEARS BEFORE SUBSTANTIAL CLINICAL PROOFS OF PEAT EFFICACY WERE ACHIEVED. SOCIAL IMPACT WAS HIGH AND RESULTED IN THE BIRTH OF THE POLISH LEGEND OF TOLPA'S MARVELLOUS DRUG.","CENTRAL EUROPEAN ETHNOMEDICAL AND OFFICINAL USES OF PEAT, WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE TOLPA PEAT PREPARATION (TPP): AN HISTORICAL REVIEW","JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY","REVIEW","JAN 10",2020,"10.1016/j.jep.2019.112248","PLANT SCIENCES; CHEMISTRY, MEDICINAL; INTEGRATIVE & COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE; PHARMACOLOGY & PHARMACY","WOS:000493211800007"

MAINTAINING THE FIDELITY OF PEAT SAMPLES DURING COLLECTION AND HANDLING CAN BE CHALLENGING, GIVEN THAT BOGS CONSIST MAINLY OF FOSSIL PLANT MATERIALS THAT TYPICALLY HAVE A VERY LOW DENSITY AND ARE EASILY COMPRESSED. THE SURFACE LAYERS OF BOGS, WHICH ARE DOMINATED BY LIVING PLANTS AND POORLY DECOMPOSED FIBROUS PEATS, ARE ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC. TO EXTRACT PEAT MONOLITHS, WE USE A BELARUS CORER FOR DEEP LAYERS AND A WARDENAAR DEVICE FOR SURFACE LAYERS.

HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT OF UNDISTURBED PEATLANDS, AS WELL AS THE RESTORATION OF DISTURBED PEATLANDS, WILL ALTER THE EXCHANGE OF CH4 WITH THE ATMOSPHERE. THE AIM OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS WAS TO COLLATE AND ANALYZE PUBLISHED STUDIES TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS THAT CONTROL CH4 EMISSIONS AND THE IMPACTS OF MANAGEMENT ON THE GAS FLUX FROM NORTHERN (LATITUDE 40 DEGREES TO 70 DEGREES N) PEATLANDS. THE ANALYSIS INCLUDES A TOTAL OF 87 STUDIES REPORTING MEASUREMENTS OF CH4 EMISSIONS TAKEN AT 186 SITES COVERING DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, PEATLAND TYPES, AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. RESULTS SHOW THAT CH4 EMISSIONS FROM NATURAL NORTHERN PEATLANDS ARE HIGHLY VARIABLE WITH A 95% CI OF 7.6-15.7 G C M(-2) YEAR(-1) FOR THE MEAN AND 3.3-6.3 G C M(-2) YEAR(-1) FOR THE MEDIAN. THE OVERALL ANNUAL AVERAGE (MEAN +/- SD) IS 12 +/- 21 G C M(-2) YEAR(-1) WITH THE HIGHEST EMISSIONS FROM FEN ECOSYSTEMS. METHANE EMISSIONS FROM NATURAL PEATLANDS ARE MAINLY CONTROLLED BY WATER TABLE (WT) DEPTH, PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, AND SOIL PH. ALTHOUGH MEAN ANNUAL AIR TEMPERATURE IS NOT A GOOD PREDICTOR OF CH4 EMISSIONS BY ITSELF, THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TEMPERATURE, PLANT COMMUNITY COVER, WT DEPTH, AND SOIL PH IS IMPORTANT. ACCORDING TO SHORT-TERM FORECASTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, THESE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS WILL BE THE MAIN DETERMINANT OF CH4 EMISSIONS FROM NORTHERN PEATLANDS. DRAINAGE SIGNIFICANTLY (P < .05) REDUCES CH4 EMISSIONS TO THE ATMOSPHERE, ON AVERAGE BY 84%. RESTORATION OF DRAINED PEATLANDS BY REWETTING OR VEGETATION/REWETTING INCREASES CH4 EMISSIONS ON AVERAGE BY 46% COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL PREMANAGEMENT CH4 FLUXES. HOWEVER, TO FULLY EVALUATE THE NET EFFECT OF MANAGEMENT PRACTICE ON THE GREENHOUSE GAS BALANCE FROM HIGH LATITUDE PEATLANDS, BOTH NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE (NEE) AND CARBON EXPORTS NEED TO BE CONSIDERED.","EMISSIONS OF METHANE FROM NORTHERN PEATLANDS: A REVIEW OF MANAGEMENT IMPACTS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE MANAGEMENT OPTIONS","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","REVIEW","OCT",2016,"10.1002/ece3.2469","ECOLOGY; EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY","WOS:000385626100029"

THE SIMULATED FLUXES MATCHED WELL TO MEASUREMENTS IN ALL MICROSITES WITHOUT ANY PARAMETER ADJUSTMENT. THE MODEL EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF MICROSITE CHARACTERISTICS, WATER TABLE AND VEGETATION COVER FOR METHANE FLUXES. WATER LEVEL DETERMINES THE MOISTURE AND OXYGEN PROFILE IN PEAT MATRIX AND THEREFORE AFFECTS METHANE PRODUCTION AND OXIDATION RATES IN PEAT PROFILE. VASCULAR PLANTS PROVIDE METHANOGENESIS WITH SUBSTRATES, FORM A PATHWAY FOR METHANE TO LIBERATE FROM PEAT TO THE ATMOSPHERE AND ENHANCE METHANE OXIDATION BY TRANSPORTING OXYGEN TO WATER SATURATED PEAT. THE MODEL CONNECTS METHANE FLUXES TO THE SEASONAL PHOTOSYNTHETIC CYCLE OF PLANTS AT THE MICROSITE LEVEL AND HENCE DYNAMICALLY COMBINES THE MICROBIAL PROCESSES IN PEAT TO CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IN THE LEVEL OF PEATLAND ECOSYSTEM. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF THE MODEL REVEALS THE IMPORTANCE OF SUBSTRATE SUPPLY TO METHANE FLUXES. IN ADDITION, THE CAPABILITY OF THE VASCULAR PLANTS TO TRANSPORT OXYGEN DOWNWARDS HAS A LARGE EFFECT ON MODEL OUTCOME. LACK OF OXYGEN AND METHANE KEEP METHANE OXIDATION AT A LOW LEVEL IN THE MODEL SIMULATIONS, AND CHANGES THAT COMPENSATE FOR THESE LACKS HAVE A REMARKABLE DECREASING EFFECT ON SIMULATED FLUX.

THE CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PEAT TOGETHER WITH ITS ACCUMULATION AND DECAY PROCESSES HAVE BEEN ANALYSED. PEAT IS AN ACIDIC MIXTURE OF DEAD AND DECOMPOSED. MAINLY VEGETABLE, MATTER FORMED IN BOGGY AREAS; IT IS THE YOUNGEST AND LEAST ALTERED COMPONENT OF THE COMBUSTIBLE ROCKS AND IS CHARACTERISED BY THE LOWEST CONTENT OF FIXED CARBON AND THE HIGHEST CONTENT OF VOLATILE CONSTITUENTS. PEAT IS FORMED BY DEGENERATION PROCESSES UNDER EXCLUSION OF ATMOSPHERIC OXYGEN BY THE ACTION OF WATER; THE SPEED OF FORMATION DEPENDS UPON THE CLIMATIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. IN MOST PEATLANDS TWO LAYERS CAN BE CHARACTERISED: THE AEROBIC ACROTELM AND THE ANAEROBIC CATOTELM, THEIR RELATIVE IMPORTANCE BEING CONTROLLED MAINLY BY THE POSITION OF THE WATER TABLE. IN THE ACROTELM THE AEROBIC PROCESSES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOSS OF UP TO 90% OF THE ORIGINAL MASS, DEGENERATION IN THE ACIDIC AND ANAEROBIC CATOTELM IS STILL IMPERFECTLY CHARACTERISED EVEN THOUGH THE CATOTELM IS THE REAL SITE OF PEAT ACCUMULATION. MOST OF THE RECENT LITERATURE CONSIDERS PEAT AS COMPOSED OF EASILY DEGRADABLE COMPOUNDS, E.G. POLYSACCHARIDES. AND RECALCITRANT MATTER (LIGNIN AND COMPLEX AROMATICS). THE LONE-TERM DESTINY OF PEAT HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY CHARACTERISED: ALTHOUGH IN A LARGE MAJORITY OF CASES IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT PEAT DECOMPOSES COMPLETELY (EVEN THOUGH SLOWLY) PROVIDED THAT IT IS GIVEN A SUFFICIENTLY LONG RESIDENCE RIME IN THE CATOTELM, SOME CASES CAN STILL BE INTERPRETED AS EXAMPLES OF SIMPLE ACCUMULATION. THE RATES OF INFLUX OF OXYGEN AND HENCE THE DEGRADATION OF ORGANIC MATTER INTO BOTH SATURATED AND PARTIALLY SATURATED PEAT HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED. THE DEPLETION RATE IS ABOUT 4500 G M(-1) YEAR(-1) FOR PARTIALLY SATURATED PEAT. THE AVERAGE DEPLETION RATE OF THE PEAT FOR THIS CASE WILL THEN BE SUCH THAT IT WILL TAKE ON THE ORDER OF 5 TO 50 YEARS TO DEGRADE HALF OF THE ORGANICS IN A 10 CM PARTIALLY SATURATED LAYER. FOR THE WATER-SATURATED CASE THE DEPLETION RATE VARIES BETWEEN 8 AND 12 G M(-2) YEAR(-1), WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN IN THE PARTIALLY SATURATED REGION. THE MODELS USED TO ANALYSE THE FIELD AND LABORATORY DATA ON GENERATION, DIFFUSION AND EMISSION OF METHANE AND CARBON DIOXIDE INDICATE THAT LABORATORY DATA AND FIELD OBSERVATIONS AGREE REASONABLY WELL. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT PEAT-ACCUMULATING ECOSYSTEMS MAY BE VALUABLE NATURAL ANALOGUES FOR THE STUDY OF THE LONG-TERM DESTINY OF INDUSTRIAL AND MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTES. ACCURATE STUDIES OF ACTIVE MIRES TOGETHER WITH AN AD HOC REVIEW OF THE EXISTING LITERATURE GIVE VALUABLE INSIGHTS IN THIS PROBLEM.

THE OBSERVED VARIATION IN SULPHUR CONTENT SPATIALLY INCREASES TOWARDS THE SOURCE AREA AWAY FROM MORE MARINE INFLUENCED AREAS, WITH INCREASED SULPHUR CONTENT THROUGH TIME LINKED TO CHANGES IN THE GENERAL DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT AS CONDITIONS BECAME MORE MARINE-INFLUENCED. A MODEL OF BASINAL SURFACE WATER AND GROUNDWATER FLOW DRIVEN BY POST-DEPOSITIONAL SOURCE AREA TECTONISM IS THOUGHT TO HAVE PLAYED ONLY A MINOR ROLE IN CONTRIBUTING SECONDARY SULPHUR TO THE COAL.

CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EFFLUXES, AN EFFLUX WHICH IN MOST ECOSYSTEMS IS A RESULT OF BOTH AUTOTROPHIC AND HETEROTROPHIC RESPIRATION, IN PARTICULAR HAVE RECEIVED INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION. THE IMPORTANCE OF BOTH CO2 AND METHANE (CH4) FLUXES ARE EMPHASISED IN THE ARCTIC BECAUSE OF THE LARGE AMOUNT OF SOIL ORGANIC CARBON STORED IN TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS AND CHANGES IN UPTAKE AND RELEASE DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGES. THIS CHAPTER FOCUSES ON CONTROLS ON SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL TRENDS IN SUBSURFACE CO2 AND CH4 PRODUCTION AS WELL AS ON TRANSPORT AND RELEASE OF GASES FROM THE SOIL OBSERVED IN THE VALLEY ZACKENBERGDALEN. A DOMINANCE OF NEAR-SURFACE TEMPERATURES CONTROLLING BOTH SPATIAL AND SEASONAL TRENDS IS SHOWN BASED ON DATA OBTAINED USING CLOSED CHAMBER AND EDDY-CORRELATION TECHNIQUES AS WELL AS IN MANIPULATED FIELD PLOTS AND IN CONTROLLED INCUBATION EXPERIMENTS. DESPITE VARIABLE TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITIES REPORTED, MOST DATA CAN BE FAIRLY WELL FITTED TO EXPONENTIAL TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT EQUATIONS. THE WATER CONTENT (AT WET SITES LINKED TO THE DEPTH TO THE WATER TABLE) IS A SECOND MAJOR FACTOR REGULATING SOIL RESPIRATION PROCESSES, BUT THE EFFECT IS QUITE DIFFERENT IN CONTRASTING VEGETATION TYPES. DRY HEATH SITES ARE SHOWN TO BE PERIODICALLY WATER LIMITED DURING THE GROWING SEASON AND RESPOND THEREFORE WITH HIGH RESPIRATION RATES WHEN WATERED. IN CONTRAST, WATER SATURATED CONDITIONS DURING MOST OF THE GROWING SEASON IN THE FEN AREAS HINDER THE AVAILABILITY OF OXYGEN, RESULTING IN BOTH CO2 AND CH4 PRODUCTION. THUS, WATER TABLE DRAWDOWN RESULTS IN DECREASING CH4 EFFLUXES BUT INCREASING CO2 EFFLUXES. ADDITIONAL CONTROLS ON GAS PRODUCTION ARE SHOWN TO BE RELATED TO THE AVAILABILITY OF SUBSTRATE AND PLANT PRODUCTIVITY. SUBSURFACE GAS PRODUCTION WILL PRODUCE PARTIAL AND TOTAL PRESSURE GRADIENT CAUSING GAS TRANSPORT, WHICH IN WELL-DRAINED SOILS IS MAINLY CONTROLLED BY DIFFUSION, WHEREAS GAS ADVECTION, BUBBLES AND TRANSPORT THROUGH ROOTS AND STEMS MAY BE IMPORTANT IN MORE SATURATED SOILS. BURSTS OF CO2 GAS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED DURING SPRING THAW AND CONFIRMED IN CONTROLLED SOIL THAWING EXPERIMENTS. FIELD OBSERVATIONS AS WELL AS EXPERIMENTAL WORK SUGGEST THAT SUCH BURSTS REPRESENT PARTLY ON-GOING SOIL RESPIRATION AND A PHYSICAL RELEASE OF GAS PRODUCED DURING THE WINTER. THE IMPORTANCE OF WINTER SOIL RESPIRATION IS EMPHASISED BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MICROBIAL RESPIRATION IN ZACKENBERG SAMPLES IS NOTED DOWN TO A LEAST -18 DEGREES C. HENCE, THE IMPORTANCE OF WINTER RESPIRATION AND BURST EVENTS IN RELATION TO SEASONAL AND FUTURE CLIMATE TRENDS REQUIRES MORE THAN JUST SUMMER MEASUREMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE AUTUMN PERIOD SEEMS IMPORTANT AS SNOWFALL PRIOR TO LOW AIR TEMPERATURE MAY INSULATE THE SOIL, KEEPING SOIL TEMPERATURES HIGH. THIS WILL EXTEND THE PERIOD OF HIGH SOIL RESPIRATION RATES AND THEREBY INCREASE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WINTER PERIOD FOR THE ANNUAL CARBON BALANCE. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTROLLING SUBSURFACE GAS PRODUCTION, WE CONCLUDE THAT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE LANDSCAPE WILL RESPOND QUITE DIFFERENTLY TO THE SAME CLIMATE CHANGES AS WELL AS THAT SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ARE LIKELY TO BE DIFFERENT FROM LONG-TERM EFFECTS.","HIGH-ARCTIC SOIL CO2 AND CH4 PRODUCTION CONTROLLED BY TEMPERATURE, WATER, FREEZING AND SNOW","ADVANCES IN ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH, VOL 40: HIGH-ARCTIC ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS IN A CHANGING CLIMATE","REVIEW",NA,2008,"10.1016/S0065-2504(07)00019-0","ECOLOGY","WOS:000256528000019"

VEGETATION TYPE DYNAMICS AND LAND SURFACE PHENOLOGY WERE STUDIED THROUGH THE USE OF HAND-HELD SENSORS OF REFLECTION OF VEGETATION, FROM WHICH THE FAR RED NORMALISED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX (NDVI-FR) CAN BE INFERRED. FURTHERMORE, SPECIES-SPECIFIC DYNAMICS WERE STUDIED THROUGH MEASURES OF TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF FLOWERING THROUGH A PERIOD OF 10 YEARS. TIME OF SNOWMELT AND TEMPERATURE WERE THE MAJOR CONTROLLING FACTORS FOR THE TIMING OF THE PHENOLOGY IN THE SIX VEGETATION TYPES: FELL-FIELD, DRYAS HEATH, CASSIOPE HEATH, SALIX HEATH, GRASSLAND, AND FEN. SNOWMELT HAD A LINEAR POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE TIMING OF THE MAXIMUM OF THE GROWING SEASON, WITH LATE SNOWMELT, CAUSING A LATER OCCURRENCE OF THE MAXIMUM. WHILE HIGHER SUMMED TEMPERATURES DURING THE GREEN-UP PERIOD (TIME FROM SNOWMELT TO MAXIMUM) ALSO WAS SHOWN TO BE POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE TIMING OF THE MAXIMUM, ENHANCED FLOWER PRODUCTION SEEMED TO CAUSE LOWER VEGETATIVE BIOMASS PRODUCTION AND HENCE A LATER MAXIMUM. THE SEASONAL VEGETATIVE PRODUCTION, EXPRESSED AS THE SEASONAL INTEGRATED NDVI-FR (SINDVI), HAD A LINEAR NEGATIVE RELATION WITH THE TEMPERATURES DURING THE PREVIOUS SUMMER. THIS WAS PROBABLY DUE TO HIGHER TEMPERATURES CAUSING MORE FLOWERS THE FOLLOWING YEAR, LEADING TO A LOWER NDVI-FR. A STRONG NEGATIVE TREND IN MAXIMUM NDVI-FR IS DOCUMENTED IN ALL SIX VEGETATION TYPES DURING THE YEARS FROM 1999 TO 2006 WITH A DECREASE OF 0.01 NDVI-FR PER YEAR. THE MAIN REASON COULD BE DRYING OF THE UPPER SOIL LAYERS DUE TO EARLIER SNOWMELT AND HIGHER EVAPOTRANSPIRATION DURING RECENT YEARS. SOME GENERAL TRENDS IN PHENOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS WERE RECOGNISED, ALTHOUGH RESPONSES VARIED AMONG SPECIES. THE TIME OF SNOW DISAPPEARANCE WAS THE MAIN DETERMINANT FOR ONSET OF FLOWERING. SHRUBS SEEMED TO BE SUPERIOR IN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF AN EARLY SNOWMELT WITH RESPECT TO INITIATION OF FLOWERING. IN ADDITION, MOST SPECIES DEVELOPED FLOWERS AND SEED CAPSULES FASTER WHEN TEMPERATURES INCREASED. MORE FLOWERS INCREASE THE CHANCE OF CROSS-POLLINATION AND HENCE, OFFER AN INCREASED POSSIBILITY FOR SEXUAL REPRODUCTION AND GENETIC EXCHANGE. MOST SPECIES INCREASED THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS IN YEARS FOLLOWING A WARM GROWING SEASON IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR, ALTHOUGH SOME SPECIES ALSO DEPENDED ON CLIMATIC CONDITIONS IN THE CURRENT YEAR PRIOR TO ONSET OF FLOWERING. EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATIONS OF GROWING SEASON LENGTH, TEMPERATURE AND INCOMING RADIATION IN PLOTS WITH THE DOMINANT DWARF SHRUB, WHITE ARCTIC BELL-HEATHER CASSIOPE TETRAGONA, CONFIRMED THAT THIS SPECIES SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED FLOWERING WHEN SUBJECTED TO SHADING OR REDUCED GROWING SEASON LENGTH.

AS A RESULT OF THE WARMER CLIMATE THE AREA BECAME FORESTED WITH BIRCH AND POPLAR DURING THE FRIESLAND PHASE (CA. 11,490-11,365 CAL BP). BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTIVITY OF THE LAKE AND ITS SURROUNDINGS INCREASED. AQUATIC VEGETATION DEVELOPED IN THE LAKE, WHILE SHRUBS OF WILLOW, REED SWAMPS AND GRASSLANDS FRINGED THE SHORES. PRECIPITATION INCREASED, WHICH CAUSED A RISE IN THE LAKE WATER TABLE AND AN INCREASE IN THE SUPPLY OF OXIC SURFACE (=RIVER) WATER INTO THE KREEKRAK TAKE.

TESTATE AMOEBA-BASED TRANSFER FUNCTIONS ARE AN ESTABLISHED METHOD FOR THE QUANTITATIVE RECONSTRUCTION OF PAST WATER-TABLE VARIATIONS IN PEATLANDS, AND HAVE BEEN APPLIED TO RESEARCH QUESTIONS IN PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY, PEATLAND ECOHYDROLOGY AND ARCHAEOLOGY. WE ANALYSED AUTOMATICALLY-LOGGED PEATLAND WATER-TABLE DATA FROM DIPWELLS LOCATED IN ENGLAND, WALES AND FINLAND AND A SUITE OF THREE YEAR, ONE YEAR AND SUMMER WATER-TABLE STATISTICS WERE CALCULATED FROM EACH LOCATION. SURFACE MOSS SAMPLES WERE EXTRACTED FROM BESIDE EACH DIPWELL AND THE TESTATE AMOEBAE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WAS DETERMINED. TWO PUBLISHED TRANSFER FUNCTIONS WERE APPLIED TO THE TESTATE-AMOEBA DATA FOR PREDICTION OF WATER-TABLE DEPTH (ENGLAND AND EUROPE). OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT ESTIMATED WATER-TABLE DEPTHS BASED ON THE TESTATE AMOEBA COMMUNITY REFLECT DIRECTIONAL CHANGES, BUT THAT THEY ARE POOR REPRESENTATIONS OF THE REAL MEAN OR MEDIAN WATER-TABLE MAGNITUDES FOR THE STUDY SITES. WE SUGGEST THAT ALTHOUGH TESTATE AMOEBA-BASED RECONSTRUCTIONS CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY PAST SHIFTS IN PEAT HYDROLOGY, THEY CANNOT CURRENTLY BE USED TO ESTABLISH PRECISE HYDROLOGICAL BASELINES SUCH AS THOSE NEEDED TO INFORM MANAGEMENT AND RESTORATION OF PEATLANDS. ONE APPROACH TO AVOID CONFUSION WITH CONTEMPORARY WATER-TABLE DETERMINATIONS IS TO USE RESIDUALS OR STANDARDISED VALUES FOR PEATLAND WATER-TABLE RECONSTRUCTIONS.

DIFFICULTIES EXIST IN ASSESSING THESE, LARGELY BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE FROM MANY RIVERS REMAINS LIMITED AND FRAGMENTARY. HERE WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RIVER KENNET, A TRIBUTARY OF THE THAMES, SINCE C. 13,000 CAL BP. SOME SIMILARITIES WITH OTHER RIVERS ARE PRESENT, SUGGESTING THAT REGIONAL CLIMATIC SHIFTS ARE IMPORTANT CONTROLS. THE KENNET DIFFERS FROM THE REGIONAL PATTERN IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. THE RATE OF RESPONSE TO SUDDEN CLIMATIC CHANGE, PARTICULARLY AT THE START OF THE HOLOCENE AND ALSO MID-HOLOCENE FOREST CLEARANCE, APPEARS VERY HIGH. THIS MAY REFLECT ABRUPT SHIFTS BETWEEN TWO CATCHMENT SCALE HYDROLOGICAL STATES ARISING FROM CONTEMPORARY CLIMATES, LAND USE CHANGE AND GEOLOGY. STADIAL HYDROLOGY IS DOMINATED BY NIVAL REGIMES, WITH LIMITED WINTER INFILTRATION AND HIGH SPRING AND SUMMER RUNOFF. UNDER AN INTERGLACIAL CLIMATE, INFILTRATION IS MORE SIGNIFICANT. THE PROBABLE ABSENCE OF PERMAFROST IN THE CATCHMENT MEANS THAT A LAG BETWEEN THE TWO STATES DUE TO ITS GRADUAL DECAY IS UNLIKELY. PALAEOECOLOGY, SUPPORTED BY RADIOCARBON DATES, SUGGESTS THAT, AT THE VERY START OF THE HOLOCENE, A DRAMATIC EPISODE OF FINE SEDIMENT DEPOSITION ACROSS MOST OF THE VALLEY FLOOR OCCURRED, LASTING 500-1000 YEARS. A PHASE OF PEAT ACCUMULATION FOLLOWED AS MINERAL SEDIMENT SUPPLY DECLINED. A FURTHER SHIFT LED TO TUFA DEPOSITION, INITIALLY IN SMALL POOLS, THEN ACROSS THE WHOLE FLOODPLAIN AREA, WITH THE RIVER FLOWING THROUGH CHANNELS CUT IN TUFA AND EXPERIENCING REPEATED AVULSION. MAJOR FLOODS, LEAVING LARGE GRAVEL BARS THAT STILL FORM POSITIVE RELIEF FEATURES ON THE FLOODPLAIN, FOLLOWED MID-HOLOCENE FLOODPLAIN STABILITY. PREHISTORIC DEFORESTATION IS LIKELY TO BE THE CAUSE OF THIS FLOODING, INDUCING A MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL SHIFT WITH SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SURFACE RUNOFF. SINCE THE BRONZE AGE, PREDOMINANTLY FINE SEDIMENTS WERE DEPOSITED ALONG THE VALLEY WITH APPARENTLY STABLE CHANNELS AND VERTICAL FLOODPLAIN ACCRETION ASSOCIATED WITH SOIL EROSION AND LESS CATASTROPHIC FLOODING. THE KENNET DEMONSTRATES THAT, WHILE A GENERAL PATTERN OF RIVER BEHAVIOUR OVER TIME, WITHIN A REGION, MAY BE IDENTIFIABLE, INDIVIDUAL RIVERS ARE LIKELY TO DIVERGE FROM THIS.

THE VALLEY IS SITUATED IN THE BORDER DISTRICT BETWEEN AUSTRIA AND SWITZERLAND. ITS GEOLOGICAL-GEOMORPHOLOGICAL SITUATION IS COMPLICATED DUE TO ITS LOCATION IN THE TRANSITION ZONE OF TWO DIFFERENT GEOLOGICAL NAPPES. THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE VALLEY IS PART OF THE LOWER ENGADINE WINDOW AND IT IS COMPOSED BY FLYSCH OF THE PENNINIC NAPPES WHILE THE WESTERN PART BELONGS TO THE AUSTROALPINE NAPPES, DOMINATED BY THE CRYSTALLINE ROCKS OF THE SILVRETTA MASSIF. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE COMPARATIVELY HIGH DEGREE OF HYGRIC CONTINENTALITY THE VAL FENGA BELONGS TO THE CLIMATIC REGION OF THE CENTRAL ALPS. TO RECONSTRUCT THE HOLOCENE CLIMATE AND VEGETATION DEVELOPMENT PALAEOBOTANICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF PEAR PROFILES, AND IN ADDITION, ANALYSIS OF POLLEN DISPERSAL HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED. THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE ACTUAL POLLEN DEPOSITION ARE MADE OF MOSS CUSHIONS OUT OF THE ENTIRE INVESTIGATION AREA. DIFFERENT GROUPS OF POLLEN TYPES (''INDICATOR UNITS'') WHICH CHARACTERIZE THE REPRESENTATION OF DIFFERENT VEGETATION UNITS AND HUMAN IMPACT IN SURFACE SAMPLES ARE DETERMINED BY THE RESULTS OF THE POLLEN ANALYSIS. THE SUITABILITY OF THESE UNITS FOR THE JUDGEMENT OF FOSSILE POLLEN PROFILES IS DISCUSSED. THE MAIN EMPHASIS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS ABOUT THE CLIMATE AND VEGETATION HISTORY WAS PUT ON THE PALAEOBOTANICAL ANALYSIS MADE OF FIVE PEAR PROFILES WHICH ARE SITUATED IN A TRANSECT FROM THE LOWER SUBALPINE UP TO THE ALPINE BELT. A SURVEY OF THE INVESTIGATED MIRES IS GIVEN IN TAB. 3. BY A SYNOPTIC REFLECTION THE PALYNOLOGICAL RESULTS OF THESE PEAR PROFILES ARE DISCUSSED, AND THE SYNCHRONOUS EFFECTS OF CLIMATIC CHANGE AND HUMAN IMPACT ON THE LANDSCAPE IN DIFFERENT ALTITUDES ARE SHOWN. FROM THE BOREAL TO THE BEGINNING OF THE ATLANTIC PERIOD A SECTION OF HIGH CLIMATIC DYNAMICS IS SHOWN BY THE POLLEN DIAGRAMS. DURING THIS TIME, THE TIMBERLINE, WHICH REACHED ALMOST THE ALTITUDE OF TODAY'S ALPINE BELT, WAS DEPRESSED SEVERAL TIMES. APPROXIMATELY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE OLDER ATLANTIC PERIOD PICEA ABIES IMMIGRATED INTO THE REGION DURING A SECTION, WHICH IS CHARACTERIZED BY HUMID CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. SOMETIME LATER, ABOUT 7000 BP, THE SPRUCE SPREAD OUR AT THE SAME TIME THE LARCH-AROLLA PINE WOOD REACHED ITS HIGHEST EXTENSION. FINDINGS OF FOSSILE PINUS CEMBRA PROVE THE RISE OF THE AROLLA PINE TO AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 2400 M ASL. DURING THE FOLLOWING TIME ALNUS VIRIDIS IMMIGRATED INTO THE REGION AS WELL AS PICEN ABIES UNDER MORE OCEANIC CONDITIONS. BUT BECAUSE OF THE CONTINENTAL CLIMATE OF THE CENTRAL ALPS, THE SPECIES ONLY OCCURS IN SMALL AMOUNTS SINCE THEN. CLIMATIC OSCILLATIONS WITH ONLY SMALL EFFECTS ON THE TIMBERLINE CHARACTERIZE THE SECTION OF THE YOUNGER ATLANTIC PERIOD. ONLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YOUNGER ATLANTIC AND THE FOLLOWING SUBBOREAL PERIOD THE INTENSITY OF THE CLIMATIC CHANGES INCREASED AND ALSO HAD EFFECTS ON THE SUBALPINE SPRUCE FOREST. AT THAT TIME THE TIMBERLINE REACHED AN ALTITUDE OF TODAY'S UPPER SUBALPINE BELT. AT THE END OF THE ATLANTIC PERIOD FIRST PALYNOLOGICAL REFERENCES OF HUMAN IMPACT APPEAR, WHICH ARE INTENSIFIED DURING THE FOLLOWING SECTION OF THE SUBBOREAL PERIOD, AND WHICH WERE CONNECTED WITH FORTIFIED SETTLEMENTS IN THE LOWER ENGADIN. DURING THE SECOND PART OF THE SUBBOREAL PERIOD THE POLLEN DIAGRAMS SHOW CLEARINGS OF THE MOUNTAIN FOREST DOWNVALLEY TO THE LOWER SUBALPINE BELT. BY THE BEGINNING OF THE SUBATLANTIC PERIOD THE HUMAN IMPACT BECAME MORE INTENSIVE. SECTIONS OF DIFFERENT HUMAN IMPACT CHARACTERIZE THE DIAGRAMS FROM THE EARLY MIDDLE AGE. SINCE THEN THE LOWER AREAS OF THE VAL FENGA ALSO WERE INFLUENCED BY THIS IMPACT. ABOUT 1400 BP, 1000 BP AND DURING THE PERIOD FROM THE 15TH TO THE 19TH CENT. THE HUMAN IMPACT CULMINATED. DURING THIS TIME, THE MOUNTAIN FOREST WAS EXTENSIVELY DESTROYED. THE AREA INVESTIGATED PHYTOSOCIOLOGICALLY IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER SECTION OF THE VAL FENGA CONTAINS PLANT COMMUNITIES OF FOURTEEN DIFFERENT CLASSES. BASING ON THEIR VERTICAL OCCURRENCES A SEPARATION OF THE SUBALPINE AND ALPINE BELT INTO THREE RESP. INTO TWO ZONES HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIOUS PLANT COMMUNITIES FOCUSSES ON RARE SYNTAXA AND THOSE WHICH ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THEIR INSUFFICIENT STATE OF INVESTIGATION IN THE ALPS UP TO NOW. THIS GROUP INCLUDES THE RELICTUAL CARICION ATROFUSCO-SAXATILIS WHICH OCCURS ON ALLUVIONS, ALLUVIAL TERRACES AND FENS. IN THE VAL FENGA THE ALLIANCE IS REPRESENTED BY FIVE CHARACTER SPECIES (CARER ATROFUSCA, CAREX MICROGLOCHIN, JUNCUS ARCTICUS, KOBRESIA SIMPLICIUSCULA UND TOFIELDIA PUSILLA) AND THREE ASSOCIATIONS OF DIFFERENT ECOLOGICAL HABITATS. THE JUNCETUM ARCTICI APPEARS AT COMPARATIVELY DRY SITES WHILST THE SPARSE STANDS OF THE CARICETUM ATROFUSCO-VAGINATAE OCCUR ON ALLUVIONS IRRIGATED BY QUICKLY FLOWING WATER. THE CARICETUM MICROGLOCHINIS CAN BE SEPARATED INTO TWO SUBASSOCIATIONS: THE KOBRESIETOSUM SIMPLICIUSCULAE ON DRIER HABITATS AND THE VERY WET CARICETOSUM MICROGLOCHINIS. OFTEN A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LATTER UNIT AND STANDS OF ELEOCHARIS QUINQUEFLORA CAN BE OBSERVED. DUE TO FLORISTIC, SYNDYNAMIC AND HABITUAL REASONS THE COMMUNITY OF ELEOCHARIS HAS BEEN ADJOINED AS AN INITIAL UNIT TO THE CARICION ATROFUSCO-SAXATILIS. AS A RESULT OF THEIR RARITY, THREAT AND THE HIGH RATE OF SPECIES MENTIONED IN THE RED LISTS THE COMMUNITIES OF THE CARICION ATROFUSCO-SAXATILIS NEED THE UPPERMOST LEVEL OF PROTECTION AND CONSERVATION. ACCORDING TO INVESTIGATIONS ABOUT THE STRATIGRAPHY OF PEAR LAYERS THE BRYOPHYTE CALLIERGON TRIFARIUM HAS ATTAINED A CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE CONCERNING THE FOUNDATION OF THE MIRE COMMUNITIES AND THE FORMATION OF PEAR IN THE HIGHER ELEVATED FENS OF THE UPPER VAL FENGA.

OCCUPATION OF PEAT MACRO-PORES BY NAPL DRAMATICALLY DECREASES THE EFFECTIVE WATER PERMEABILITY AND LEADS TO LOWER RATES OF WATER INFILTRATION AND GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE IN THE CONTAMINATED AREA. WITH RESPECT TO DISSOLVED-PHASE HYDROCARBONS, THE DUAL POROSITY STRUCTURE OF PEAT SOIL, WHICH EXHIBITS LARGER PORES AND HIGHER EFFECTIVE POROSITY NEAR THE SURFACE, ALSO FAVOURS PREFERENTIAL TRANSPORT IN THE SURFACE PEAT LAYER, AND LEADS TO INCREASING SOLUTE RETARDATION WITH DEPTH. IN ADDITION, ADSORPTION OF HYDROCARBON SOLUTES ONTO NATURAL DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON PRESENT IN PEAT PORE WATER INFLUENCES THE EFFECTIVE ADSORPTION OF HYDROCARBON SOLUTES ONTO PEAT BY REDUCING THE APPARENT ADSORPTION PARTITIONING COEFFICIENT. THE CONCEPTS AND EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THIS MANUSCRIPT SUGGEST BOTH FREE-PHASE AND DISSOLVED-PHASE HYDROCARBON HAVE RESTRICTED MOBILITY IN PEATLANDS. ON THIS BASIS, IN LARGE PEATLANDS WHERE ECOLOGICAL FUNCTION IS NOT NOTABLY IMPACTED, A CASE CAN BE MADE FOR ALLOWING NATURAL PROCESSES TO DEGRADE THE HYDROCARBON, RATHER THAN THE COMMON RESPONSE OF DIGGING UP AND DISPOSING OF CONTAMINATED SOILS, WHICH DESTROYS THE ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION.","FATE AND TRANSPORT OF FREE-PHASE AND DISSOLVED-PHASE HYDROCARBONS IN PEAT AND PEATLANDS: DEVELOPING A CONCEPTUAL MODEL","ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS","REVIEW","MAR",2018,"10.1139/er-2017-0002","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000426131300005"

THEY HAVE ALSO GREAT BIOLOGICAL, HISTORICAL AND PALCOECOLOGICAL VALUES. THESE FEATURES LED TO A LARGE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH AND PUBLICATIONS, ESPECIALLY CONCEPTUAL AND NUMERICAL MODELS IN VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC FIELDS. DRAWING ON THIS LITERATURE, WE PROPOSE AN INTEGRATED CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF BOG FUNCTIONING. THE MODEL IS BUILT ON 8 BASIC ASSUMPTIONS ACTING AT TWO SCALES: THE ECOSYSTEM AS A WHOLE, THE BOG OR MESOTOPE AND THE MICROFORMS, THE ELEMENTARY SYSTEMIC UNITS. FIVE KINDS OF ECOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS DRIVING THE ECOSYSTEM ARE DEFINED TOO. BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS, THE CONSTRAINTS AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DATA, THRESHOLDS AND POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FEEDBACKS ARE ELUCIDATED. THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACKS CONTROLLING THE DEVELOPMENT AND HOMEOSTASIS OF THE ECOSYSTEM ARE RELATED TO THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE VEGETATION WHICH BUILDS THE PEAT BODY, THE SHAPE OF THE LATER AND THE WATER FLUXES PASSING THROUGH IT. THE POSITIVE FEEDBACK ALLOWING THE ESTABLISHMENT AND THE PERSISTENCE OF THE ECOSYSTEM IS RELATED TO PEAT MOSS ENGINEERING. FOUR POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOPS CAN STOP THE PEAT PRODUCTION, AND LEAD TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BOG. TWO LOOPS ARE BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES INVOLVING TREES AND BLUE MOOR GRASS (MOLINIA CAERULEA) WHICH SPREAD ONTO THE BOG. THE TWO OTHER LOOPS ARE RELATED TO SOIL AND SHAPE DISTURBANCE AND CHANGES IN PRODUCTION AND DEGRADATION OF THE ORGANIC MATTER. THE MODEL IS ESPECIALLY DESIGNED TO HELP ECOLOGICAL MONITORING AND HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF AN ECOLOGICAL DIAGNOSTIC INTEGRATING PLANTS, SOIL AND WATER FLUXES. BASED ON THIS MODEL, ACTION PLANS SHOULD FOCUS ON MAINTAINING THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACKS AND THE PEAT MOSS ENGINEERING WHILE STOPPING THE UNFAVOURABLE OTHER POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOPS.","ECOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS ON SPHAGNUM BOG DEVELOPMENT: A CONCEPTUAL MODEL FOR CONSERVATION.","REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE","REVIEW",NA,2006,NA,"ECOLOGY","WOS:000239079500001"

THEY ARE CHARACTERIZED BY A NEAR-SURFACE WATER TABLE CONTROLLED BY A COMBINATION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PROCESSES, INFLUENCED BY SHORT-TERM METEOROLOGICAL AND LONG-TERM CLIMATE VARIATIONS AMONG OTHER FACTORS. SITE-SPECIFIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS PEAT HYDRODYNAMIC PROPERTIES, SURFACE VEGETATION PATTERNS, AND HYDROGEOLOGICAL SETTING ALSO SUBSTANTIALLY INFLUENCE WATER TABLE DYNAMICS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK WAS TO CHARACTERIZE THE INFLUENCE OF HYDROGEOLOGICAL SETTING AND METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS ON WATER TABLE DEPTHS (WTD) AND ON FLUCTUATIONS THEREIN IN SEVEN OMBROTROPHIC PEATLANDS IN OR NEAR THE ST. LAWRENCE LOWLANDS (SOUTHERN QUEBEC, CANADA). UP-GRADIENT, MID-GRADIENT, AND DOWN-GRADIENT LOCATIONS WERE MONITORED IN THE SEVEN PEATLANDS, USING DIPWELLS WITH HOURLY WTD RECORDINGS. WTD WAS ALSO MONITORED IN THE MARGINAL MINEROTROPHIC ZONE FOUND IN THREE OF THE SEVEN PEATLANDS. ADDITIONALLY, HEADS IN THE OUTFLOW (I.E., RECEIVING DIFFUSED WATER FROM THE PEATLAND) AND INFLOW (I.E., PROVIDING DIFFUSED WATER TO THE PEATLAND) ZONES WITHIN THE ADJACENT MINERAL DEPOSITS WERE MONITORED IN SEVEN AND THREE PEATLANDS RESPECTIVELY, USING PIEZOMETERS WITH HOURLY HYDRAULIC HEAD RECORDINGS. HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITIES FOR THE OUTFLOW ZONES RANGED BETWEEN 1.4*10(-7) AND 8.5*10(-3) CM/S, WHEREAS THOSE OF THE INFLOW ZONES RANGED BETWEEN 5.6*10(-7) AND 3.9*10(-6) CM/S. EVAPOTRANSPIRATION WAS SHOWN TO BE THE DOMINANT FACTOR CONTROLLING MONTHLY CUMULATIVE WATER TABLE DECREASES (MCD), WHILE PRECIPITATION DOMINATED THE MONTHLY CUMULATIVE WATER TABLE INCREASES (MCI). A STRONG CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN MEAN PEATLAND WTD AND OUTFLOW ZONE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY. PEATLANDS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AS BEING STRONGLY CONNECTED WITH THE ADJACENT MINERAL DEPOSITS IN A DIFFUSE UNDERGROUND OUTFLOW ZONE SHOWED THE GREATEST VARIATIONS IN WATER STORAGE. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN PEATLANDS AND ADJACENT MINERAL DEPOSITS IN CONTROLLING WTD, AS FOUND FOR THOSE LOCATED IN THE ST. LAWRENCE LOWLANDS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT WATER TABLE FLUCTUATIONS ARE STRONGLY CONTROLLED BY METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS, AND THAT HYDROGEOLOGICAL SETTING EXERTS A STRONG CONTROL ON MCI AND MCD. MOREOVER, THIS WORK SHOWS THAT WTD IN OMBROTROPHIC PEATLANDS IS INFLUENCED BY THE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY OF THE OUTFLOW ZONES, AND CONFIRMS THAT AQUIFER - PEATLAND CONNECTIVITY INFLUENCES PEATLAND WATER STORAGE VARIATIONS, AND THEREFORE PEATLAND VULNERABILITY TO DISTURBANCES IN AQUIFER GROUNDWATER LEVELS.","HOW DO HYDROGEOLOGICAL SETTING AND METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS INFLUENCE WATER TABLE DEPTH AND FLUCTUATIONS IN OMBROTROPHIC PEATLANDS?","JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X","REVIEW","JUL",2019,"10.1016/j.hydroa.2019.100032","GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY; WATER RESOURCES","WOS:000658513800001"

THESE WETLANDS COMPRISE MORE THAN HALF OF THE LANDSCAPE, AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION AND LOCAL HYDROLOGY ARE THE RESULT OF INTERACTIONS AMONG A SUBHUMID CLIMATE, TOPOGRAPHY, AND SPATIALLY HETEROGENEOUS SURFICIAL AND BEDROCK GEOLOGY. SINCE HYDROLOGY PLAYS A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN WETLAND ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING AND DETERMINES WETLAND SENSITIVITY TO HUMAN DISTURBANCES, THE CHARACTERIZATION OF ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS ON WETLAND HYDROLOGY IN THE AOSR IS NECESSARY TO ASSESS WETLAND RESILIENCE AND TO IMPROVE CURRENT BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. AS SUCH, THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE IMPACTS OF OIL SANDS DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED DISTURBANCES INCLUDING INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRUCTION, GRAVEL EXTRACTION, AND LAND CLEARING ON WETLAND FUNCTION IN THE AOSR. HYDROLOGIC DISTURBANCES IN WETLANDS IN THE AOSR INCLUDE CHANGES TO SOIL HYDROPHYSICAL PROPERTIES THAT CONTROL WATER TABLE POSITION, THE INTERRUPTION OF RECHARGE-DISCHARGE PATTERNS, AND ALTERATION OF MICROMETEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS; THESE IN TURN GOVERN WETLAND ECOLOGICAL STRUCTURE AND WETLAND ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES (E.G., EVAPOTRANSPIRATION, NUTRIENT CYCLING). GIVEN THAT ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE CAN AFFECT NATURAL WETLAND SUCCESSION, LONG-TERM HYDROLOGICAL MONITORING IS CRUCIAL FOR PREDICTING THE RESPONSE OF THESE ECOSYSTEMS TO VARYING LEVELS OF HUMAN IMPACT.","WETLANDS IN THE ATHABASCA OIL SANDS REGION: THE NEXUS BETWEEN WETLAND HYDROLOGICAL FUNCTION AND RESOURCE EXTRACTION","ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS","REVIEW","SEP",2020,"10.1139/er-2019-0040","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000563772300003"

THIS PAPER DEMONSTRATES THE POSSIBILITY OF QUANTIFYING SUB-CATCHMENT NUTRIENT BUDGETS FROM ROUTINELY MONITORED HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL DATA. THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ANTHROPOGENIC NUTRIENT SOURCES WAS QUANTIFIED FOR A SMALL CATCHMENT IN SCOTLAND. WITHIN THE CATCHMENT THERE ARE TWO SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST, INCLUDING TWO LOCHS AND A FLOODPLAIN MIRE. THE STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR PRESCRIBING STRATEGIES TO SAFEGUARD THE CONSERVATION INTERESTS OF THESE AQUATIC SYSTEMS. 2. THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF NITRATE WAS FOUND TO BE GROUNDWATER. PHOSPHATE AND AMMONIUM LOADINGS WERE GREATEST IN SURFACE RUN-OFF. THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE GREATEST CONTRIBUTOR TOWARDS THESE NUTRIENT SOURCES IS AGRICULTURE. EVEN WHEN CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES OF LOSSES WERE APPLIED, CURRENT FERTILIZER AND ANIMAL INPUTS COULD ACCOUNT FOR PRESENT DAY NUTRIENT LOADINGS. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN THE AREA UNDER ARABLE FARMING AND UNDER INDIVIDUAL CROPS DURING THE PAST 30 YEARS ARE CONSISTENT WITH TRENDS IN NITRATE AND PHOSPHATE LOADS. 3. NUTRIENT INPUTS FROM SEWAGE WORKS OVERFLOWS AND SEPTIC TANKS WITHIN THE CATCHMENT WERE ESTIMATED TO BE SMALL. LEACHATE FROM A LANDFILL SITE WITHIN THE CATCHMENT WAS ALSO NOT CONSIDERED TO BE A MAJOR SOURCE OF NUTRIENTS, BUT A MORE INTENSIVE WATER QUALITY MONITORING PROGRAMME WOULD BE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THE ABSENCE OF LEACHATE PLUMES. 4. THE ONLY LONG-TERM SOLUTION TO REDUCING NUTRIENT LOADINGS TO THE AQUATIC SYSTEMS IS A REDUCTION IN AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE CATCHMENT AND AVOIDANCE OF FERTILIZER AND SLURRY APPLICATIONS NEAR WATER SOURCES. DIVERSION OF DRAINAGE DITCH WATERS SUPPLYING THE FLOODPLAIN MIRE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY BUT THE HYDROLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH AN ACTION COULD INDUCE MORE SEVERE DEGRADATION THAN THAT DUE TO NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT.","QUANTIFYING ANTHROPOGENIC NUTRIENT SOURCES AND LOADINGS WITHIN A SMALL CATCHMENT WITH CONSERVATION INTERESTS, EASTERN SCOTLAND","AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS","REVIEW","SEP",1994,"10.1002/aqc.3270040307","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; MARINE & FRESHWATER BIOLOGY; WATER RESOURCES","WOS:A1994PJ66300006"

THE AIM OF THE WORK WAS TO COMPARE THE ECOSYSTEM CO2, HEAT AND WATER VAPOR EXCHANGE IN THE OLD-GROWTH SPRUCE FOREST AND MESO-OLIGOTROPHIC PEATLAND, TYPICAL ECOSYSTEMS OF THE MIDDLE TAIGA LANDSCAPES ON THE EUROPEAN RUSSIA. THE STUDY WAS MADE BY USING THE EDDY-COVARIANCE METHOD. IN THE WARM PERIOD OF THE YEAR, THE SPRUCE FOREST ECOSYSTEM WAS CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER VALUES OF THE NET RADIATION (R-N) AND TURBULENT HEAT EXCHANGE (H) THAN THE PEATLAND. IN THE PEATLAND, THE LATENT HEAT FLUX (LE) IN JULY REPRESENTED MORE THAN THE HALF OF THE NET RADIATION. NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE CO2 (NEE) FROM 1ST APRIL TO 31ST AUGUST WAS -327 GC/M(2) IN THE SPRUCE FOREST AND -40 GC/M(2) IN THE PEATLAND, AND THE TOTAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION (ET) WAS 324 MM AND 300 MM, RESPECTIVELY. A CLOSE CORRELATION WAS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN NEE AND ET IN DAILY DYNAMICS (R-2 = 0.7-0.9). THE AVERAGE DAILY VALUES OF NET EXCHANGE CO2 IN SPRUCE FORESTS ARE CLOSELY CORRELATED WITH THE NET RADIATION (R-2 = 0.63) AND TURBULENT HEAT EXCHANGE (R-2 = 0.57). FOR THE MESO-OLIGOTROPHIC PEATLAND, HEAT TRANSFER FACTORS TURNED OUT TO BE LESS SIGNIFICANT (R-2 = 0.38-0.45).

ALTHOUGH EROSION AND RUNOFF CAN CONTRIBUTE TO LOSS OF P, THE LARGE AMOUNT OF FERTILIZER APPLIED CAUSES A RAPID BUILD-UP OF THIS NUTRIENT, RESULTING IN THE DOWNWARD MOVEMENT OF EXCESS P IN THE SOIL PROFILE AND SUBSEQUENT LOSS THROUGH TILE DRAINAGE WATER. FOR ARABLE ORGANIC SOILS, THESE LOSSES OFTEN OCCUR THROUGH SUBSURFACE TILE DRAINS, A COMMON REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN A FAVORABLE AIR-WATER BALANCE IN THE CROP ROOT ZONE, AS WELL AS TO PREVENT SOIL SUBSIDENCE. AS SUCH, SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE IS A MAJOR PATHWAY FOR AGRICULTURAL P LOSS, CONTRIBUTING TO PERSISTENT EUTROPHICATION OF RIVERS, LAKES, AND ESTUARIES GLOBALLY. ALTHOUGH STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED ON P MITIGATION WITHIN ORGANIC SOILS, APPLICATION OF DRAINAGE WATER MANAGEMENT (DWM) AS A P MITIGATION STRATEGY IN THESE SOILS, HAS NOT BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ADDRESS THIS GAP IN KNOWLEDGE BY REVIEWING PREVIOUS STUDIES ON P LOSSES FROM SUBSURFACE DRAINED AGRICULTURAL ORGANIC SOILS WHILE EVALUATING POTENTIAL MITIGATION STRATEGIES. SPECIFICALLY, THIS PAPER ASSESSES THE UNIQUE PROPERTIES OF ORGANIC SOILS THAT COULD INFLUENCE P FATE AND TRANSPORT, SUCH AS THE DISTRIBUTION OF P POOLS WITHIN THE SOIL POOLS; VARIABLE PORE GEOMETRY, HYDROPHOBICITY, AND SHRINKAGE; P LOADS EXITING TILE DRAINS; AND DWM PRACTICES IN MITIGATING P LOSSES. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT P RETENTION IS AFFECTED BY THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF SOIL WATER MOVEMENT IN ORGANIC SOILS AND THAT SUBSTANTIAL P LOADS ENTER SURROUNDING WATER BODIES VIA SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE EFFLUENT.

THE RESPONSE OF CATOTELM C TO CLIMATE FORCING IS UNCERTAIN, BECAUSE PRIOR EXPERIMENTS HAVE FOCUSED ON SURFACE WARMING. WE SHOW THAT DEEP PEAT HEATING OF A 2 M-THICK PEAT COLUMN RESULTS IN AN EXPONENTIAL INCREASE IN CH4 EMISSIONS. HOWEVER, THIS RESPONSE IS DUE SOLELY TO SURFACE PROCESSES AND NOT DEGRADATION OF CATOTELM PEAT. INCUBATIONS SHOW THAT ONLY THE TOP 20-30 CM OF PEAT FROM EXPERIMENTAL PLOTS HAVE HIGHER CH4 PRODUCTION RATES AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES. RADIOCARBON ANALYSES DEMONSTRATE THAT CH4 AND CO2 ARE PRODUCED PRIMARILY FROM DECOMPOSITION OF SURFACE-DERIVED MODERN PHOTOSYNTHATE, NOT CATOTELM C. THERE ARE NO DIFFERENCES IN MICROBIAL ABUNDANCES, DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER CONCENTRATIONS OR DEGRADATIVE ENZYME ACTIVITIES AMONG TREATMENTS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ALTHOUGH SURFACE PEAT WILL RESPOND TO INCREASING TEMPERATURE, THE LARGE RESERVOIR OF CATOTELM C IS STABLE UNDER CURRENT ANOXIC CONDITIONS.","STABILITY OF PEATLAND CARBON TO RISING TEMPERATURES","NATURE COMMUNICATIONS","ARTICLE","DEC 13",2016,"10.1038/ncomms13723","MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES","WOS:000389626800001"

THE MAJORITY OF GAS PRODUCTS WERE RELEASED DURING THE DECOMPOSITION TEMPERATURE OF 150-550 DEGREES C, RESULTING IN ABOUT 60% MASS LOSS OF PEAT. THE MAIN GAS SPECIES DETECTED DURING 150-400 DEGREES C WERE CO2, CO, CH4, C2H6, HCOOH, CH3CH2COOH, C4H8 AND CH2CHCHO. FROM 400 DEGREES C TO 550 DEGREES C, SOME AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS WERE IDENTIFIED, INCLUDING BENZALDEHYDE, PHENOL, BENZOIC ACID AND TOLUENE. THE RELEASE OF CO2, CO, CH4 AND SOME AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS OVER 550 DEGREES C PROVIDED THE EVIDENCE OF CHAR PYROLYSIS. A FIVE-STEP PYROLYSIS SCHEME INCLUDING WATER EVAPORATION, HEMICELLULOSE, CELLULOSE AND LIGNIN DEGRADATION, AND CHAR PYROLYSIS WAS USED TO SIMULATE PEAT DECOMPOSITION PROCESS IN INERT ATMOSPHERE. THE WELL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CALCULATED AND EXPERIMENTAL CURVES INDICATED THAT MAJOR ALIPHATIC GASES WERE DERIVED FROM HEMICELLULOSE AND CELLULOSE PYROLYSIS, WHILE AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS WERE MAINLY FROM LIGNIN AND CHAR PYROLYSIS.

OUR STUDY PRESENTS THE FIRST FORMAL MONITORING OF A PLANNED BEAVER-ASSISTED RESTORATION, FOCUSSING ON CHANGES IN VEGETATION OVER 12 YEARS WITHIN AN AGRICULTURALLY-DEGRADED FEN FOLLOWING BEAVER RELEASE, BASED ON REPEATED SAMPLING OF FIXED PLOTS. EFFECTS ARE COMPARED TO UNGRAZED EXCLOSURES WHICH ALLOWED THE WIDER INFLUENCE OF WATERLOGGING TO BE SEPARATED FROM DISTURBANCE THROUGH TREE FELLING AND HERBIVORY. AFTER 12 YEARS OF BEAVER PRESENCE MEAN PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS HAD INCREASED ON AVERAGE BY 46% PER PLOT, WHILST THE CUMULATIVE NUMBER OF SPECIES RECORDED INCREASED ON AVERAGE BY 148%. HETEROGENEITY, MEASURED BY DISSIMILARITY OF PLOT COMPOSITION, INCREASED ON AVERAGE BY 71%. PLANTS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH MOISTURE AND LIGHT CONDITIONS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN COVERAGE, WHEREAS SPECIES INDICATIVE OF HIGH NITROGEN DECREASED.

MOSTLY REWETTING MEASURES ARE REQUIRED TO IMPROVE THE HYDROLOGY OF DAMAGED PEATLANDS, WHICH IS A PRECONDITION FOR THE RESETTLEMENT OF PEAT-FORMING PLANT SPECIES. THUS, IN TERM OF DOM, THERE IS A SPECIAL NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW REWETTING MEASURES AFFECT DOM CHARACTERISTICS AND CONCENTRATIONS. TO ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL LEACHING OF HUMIC SUBSTANCES FROM REWETTED AREAS TWO NATURAL SITES WERE COMPARED WITH FOUR ARTIFICIALLY REWETTED SITES IN A PEATLAND AREA OF THE HARZ MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK, GERMANY. THIS WAS DONE WITH REGARDS TO DOM QUALITY BY COMBINING THE RESULTS FROM FOURIER TRANSFORM ION CYCLOTRON RESONANCE MASS SPECTROMETRY (FT-ICR-MS, MEASURED AT ONE TIME IN SPRING) AND EXCITATION-EMISSION-MATRIX FLUORESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY (EEMF, MEASURED MONTHLY FOR THE PERIOD OF ONE YEAR). THE DOM QUALITY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS VARIABLE IN THE PRISTINE PEATLAND SOIL WATER COMPARED TO THE REWETTED PEATLAND SOIL WATERS, FROM BOTH A SPATIAL AND A SEASONAL PERSPECTIVE. THE SELL WATER FROM THE REWETTED PEATLAND SITES SHOWED A HIGHER DEGREE OF HUMIFICATION COMPARED TO PRISTINE PEATLAND. DOC CONCENTRATION WAS MOSTLY CONSISTENT IN THE PRISTINE PEATLAND OVER THE YEAR. THE REWETTED PEATLANDS SHOWED HIGHER DOC LEVELS IN SUMMER MONTHS AND LOWER DOC IN WINTER MONTHS COMPARED TO THE PRISTINE PEATLAND. IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THE REWETTING OF PEATLANDS IS COUPLED WITH HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF DOC IN SOIL WATER AND ITS QUALITY IS HIGHLY AROMATIC (AS REFLECTED BY THE OBSERVED VALUES FROM THE HUMIFICATION INDEX) DURING TIMES WITH ELEVATED TEMPERATURE.

A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE UK'S HORTICULTURAL FARMING TAKES PLACE ON DRAINED LOWLAND PEATLANDS, WHICH ARE A SOURCE OF SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CO2 INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. THIS STUDY SET OUT TO ESTABLISH WHETHER TAISING THE WATER TABLE FROM THE CURRENTLY USED 50 CM TO 30 CM COULD REDUCE GHGS EMISSIONS FROM AGRICULTURAL PEATLANDS, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY MAINTAINING THE CURRENT LEVELS OF HORTICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY. A FACTORIAL DESIGN EXPERIMENT USED AGRICULTURAL PEAT SOIL COLLECTED FROM THE NORFOLK FENS (AMONG THE LARGEST OF THE UK'S LOWLAND PEATLANDS UNDER INTENSIVE CULTIVATION) TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF WATER TABLE LEVELS, ELEVATED CO2, AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION ON GHG FLUXES AND CROP PRODUCTIVITY OF RADISH, ONE OF THE MOST ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT FENLAND CROPS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHOW THAT A WATER TABLE OF 30 CM CAN INCREASE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE RADISH CROP WHILE ALSO REDUCING SOIL CO2 EMISSIONS BUT WITHOUT A RESULTANT LOSS OF CH4 TO THE ATMOSPHERE, UNDER BOTH AMBIENT AND ELEVATED CO2 CONCENTRATIONS.

A DATA SET OF PEAT HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES (188 SOIL WATER RETENTION CURVES [SWRCS], 71 UNSATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY CURVES [UHCS], AND 256 SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY [K-S] VALUES) WAS ASSEMBLED FROM THE LITERATURE; THE OBTAINED DATA ORIGINATED FROM PEAT SAMPLES WITH AN ORGANIC MATTER (OM) CONTENT RANGING FROM 23 TO 97 WT% (WEIGHT PERCENT; AND ACCORDING VARIATION IN BULK DENSITY) REPRESENTING VARIOUS DEGREES OF PEAT DEGRADATION.

REWETTING OF DISTURBED PEATLANDS FACILITATES THEIR ECOLOGICAL RECOVERY AND MAY HELP THEM REVERT TO CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) SINKS. HOWEVER, REWETTING MAY ALSO CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL EMISSIONS OF THE MORE POTENT GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) METHANE (CH4). OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXCHANGE OF CO2 AND CH4 FOLLOWING REWETTING DURING RESTORATION OF DISTURBED PEATLANDS IS CURRENTLY LIMITED. THIS STUDY QUANTIFIES ANNUAL FLUXES OF CO2 AND CH4 IN A DISTURBED AND REWETTED AREA LOCATED IN THE BURNS BOG ECOLOGICAL CONSERVANCY AREA IN DELTA, BC, CANADA. BURNS BOG IS RECOGNIZED AS THE LARGEST RAISED BOG ECOSYSTEM ON NORTH AMERICA'S WEST COAST. BURNS BOG WAS SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED IN SIZE AND DEGRADED BY PEAT MINING AND AGRICULTURE. SINCE 2005, THE BOG HAS BEEN DECLARED A CONSERVANCY AREA, WITH RESTORATION EFFORTS FOCUSING ON REWETTING DISTURBED ECOSYSTEMS TO RECOVER SPHAGNUM AND SUPPRESS FIRES. USING THE EDDY COVARIANCE (EC) TECHNIQUE, WE MEASURED YEAR-ROUND (16 JUNE 2015 TO 15 JUNE 2016) TURBULENT FLUXES OF CO2 AND CH4 FROM A TOWER PLATFORM IN AN AREA REWETTED FOR THE LAST 8 YEARS. THE STUDY AREA, DOMINATED BY SEDGES AND SPHAGNUM, EXPERIENCED A VARYING WATER TABLE POSITION THAT RANGED BETWEEN 7.7 (INUNDATION) AND -26.5 CM FROM THE SURFACE DURING THE STUDY YEAR. THE ANNUAL CO2 BUDGET OF THE REWETTED AREA WAS -179 +/- 26.2 GCO(2)-CM-2 YR(-1) (CO2 SINK) AND THE ANNUAL CH4 BUDGET WAS 17 +/- 1.0 GCH(4-)CM(-2) YR(-1) (CH4 SOURCE). GROSS ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY (GEP) EXCEEDED ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION (R-E) DURING SUMMER MONTHS (JUNE-AUGUST), CAUSING A NET CO2 UPTAKE. IN SUMMER, HIGH CH4 EMISSIONS (121 MGCH(4)-CM-2 DAY(-1)) WERE MEASURED. IN WINTER (DECEMBER-FEBRUARY), WHILE ROUGHLY EQUAL MAGNITUDES OF GEP AND R-E MADE THE STUDY AREA CO2 NEUTRAL, VERY LOW CH4 EMISSIONS (9 MGCH(4)-CM-2 DAY(-1)) WERE OBSERVED. THE KEY ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CONTROLLING THE SEASONALITY OF THESE EXCHANGES WERE DOWNWELLING PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY ACTIVE RADIATION AND 5 CM SOIL TEMPERATURE. IT APPEARS THAT THE HIGH WATER TABLE CAUSED BY DITCH BLOCKING SUPPRESSED R-E. WITH LOW TEMPERATURES IN WINTER, CH4 EMISSIONS WERE MORE SUPPRESSED THAN R-E.

ALTHOUGH THE FACTS ARE WELL KNOWN, THE POLICIES LEADING TO DIMINISHED EMISSIONS ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT. WE HAVE ANALYSED THE REASONS WHY THE MITIGATION POTENTIAL IS NOT FULLY UTILIZED AND WHAT COULD BE DONE BETTER IN NATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION OF CLIMATE POLICIES. FOUR CASES ARE USED TO ILLUSTRATE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO REACH MITIGATION TARGETS: DETERMINING THE AMOUNT AND PROPERTIES OF PEAT SOILS, ESTIMATING THE POTENTIAL, COSTS AND FEASIBILITY OF THE MITIGATION MEASURES, AND SELECTING AND IMPLEMENTING THE BEST MEASURES. A COMMON FEATURE FOR ALL OF THE CASES WAS THAT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE POLICIES HAVE INCREASED THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN GHG EMISSIONS FROM PEAT SOILS AND INCREASED THE PRESSURE FOR MITIGATION. BASICALLY THE SAME FACTORS RESTRICT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MITIGATION MEASURES IN ALL COUNTRIES WITH SIGNIFICANT PEAT SOIL AREAS. THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE IS LACK OF POLICY COHERENCE, E.G. IGNORING CLIMATE POLICIES WHEN PLANNING LAND USE OR AGRICULTURAL POLICIES. WE CONCLUDE THAT GHG MITIGATION IS ACHIEVED ONLY IF OTHER POLICIES, ESPECIALLY NATIONAL REGULATIONS AND STRATEGIES, ARE IN LINE WITH CLIMATE POLICIES.

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF LONG-TERM DRAINAGE ON SOIL TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES. IN AUTUMN 2012, SOIL SURVEY AND SAMPLING WAS CARRIED OUT ON FIVE SHALLOW PEATLANDS IN THE CENTRAL SUDETEN MOUNTAINS (POLAND) WHICH HAD BEEN DRAINED FOR FORESTRY USE IN THE LATE 1800S OR EARLY 1900S. FOUR ORGANIC SOILS (HISTOSOLS) AND ONE ORGANO-MINERAL SOIL (HISTIC GLEYSOL) WERE STUDIED. THE SURFACE SOIL HORIZONS WERE MAINLY TRANSFORMED DUE TO LONG-TERM FORESTRY DRAINAGE. INCREASED AERATION OF THESE LAYERS HAD ENHANCED THEIR CONTENT OF LABILE FORMS OF CARBON AND THEY WERE UNDERGOING SECONDARY TRANSFORMATION. SOIL TRANSFORMATION WAS MORE ADVANCED IN FEN PEATLANDS THAN IN TRANSITIONAL MIRE OR RAISED BOGS. ONLY THE FENS EXHIBITED CHARACTERISTIC EVIDENCE OF THE MOORSH-FORMING PROCESS. FURTHER DRYING OF THESE SOILS WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT THEIR REWETTING POTENTIAL AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE EFFECTIVE APPLICATION OF RESTORATION TREATMENTS. IN ORDER TO REDUCE ORGANIC MATTER TRANSFORMATION AND LOSS FROM THE INVESTIGATED PEATLAND AREAS, THEIR DRAINAGE DITCHES SHOULD BE BLOCKED.

TOTAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC ACCUMULATION RATES (ARS) OF PB, CU AND AS ESTIMATED FOR THE LAST CA. 3500 YEARS SHOWED SIMILAR CHRONOLOGIES, AND REVEALED TWELVE PERIODS OF ELEVATED ARS OF PB, AS AND CU RELATED TO POSSIBLE MINING AND METALLURGIC ACTIVITIES. IN TOTAL, FOUR PERIODS OF ELEVATED ARS OF PB, CU AND AS WERE DETECTED DURING THE MIDDLE AND LATE BRONZE AGES, INCLUDING A DISTINCT LATE BRONZE AGE POLLUTION EVENT BETWEEN 1030 BCE AND 910 BCE. THE IRON AGE INCLUDED THREE EPISODES OF INCREASED ARS OF PB AND AS; THE FIRST AND THE MOST DISTINCTIVE EPISODE, RECORDED BETWEEN 730 AND 440 BCE, WAS SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE BYLANY CULTURE DURING THE HALLSTATT PERIOD. THE ROMAN AGE WAS CHARACTERIZED BY ONE POLLUTION EVENT, TWO EVENTS WERE DETECTED IN THE MIDDLE AGES, AND THE LAST TWO DURING THE MODERN PERIOD. ENHANCED ELEMENT ARS IN THE LATE 12TH AND 15TH CENTURIES CLEARLY DOCUMENTED THE ONSET OF TWO PERIODS OF INTENSE MINING IN THE ORE MOUNTAINS. METAL ARS CULMINATED IN CA. 1600 CE, AND SUBSEQUENTLY DECREASED AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRTY YEARS'WAR. THE LAST BOOM OF MINING BETWEEN 1700 CE AND 1830 CE REPRESENTED THE LAST PERIOD OF IMPORTANT METALLURGICAL OPERATIONS. LATE MEDIEVAL AND MODERN PERIOD METAL ARS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH WRITTEN DOCUMENTS.

AFTER [C-13] CELLOBIOSE AMENDMENT, THE MESOTROPHIC FEN PRODUCED EQUAL AMOUNTS OF CH4 AND CO2. THE OLIGOTROPHIC FEN HAD LOWER CH4 PRODUCTION BUT PRODUCED 3 TO 59 TIMES MORE CO2 THAN CH4. RNA STABLE-ISOTOPE PROBING REVEALED THAT IN THE MESOTROPHIC FEN WITH HIGHER CH4 PRODUCTION, CELLOBIOSE-DERIVED CARBON WAS MAINLY ASSIMILATED BY VARIOUS RECOGNIZED FERMENTERS OF FIRMICUTES AND BY PROTEOBACTERIA.

THUS EVEN HEAVILY DEGRADED ORGANIC SOILS MIXED WITH SAND STILL SHOWED A DUAL POROSITY COMPARABLE TO DEGRADED PEAT SOILS. PERCOLATING THE COLUMNS WITH THE HIGH EC SOLUTION CAUSED LOW PH VALUES, PROBABLY DUE TO ION EXCHANGE AND CATION BRIDGING. THE COMBINATION OF HIGH EC AND LOW PH GREATLY DECREASED DOC CONCENTRATIONS AT THE OUTLET OF THE COLUMNS. DOC CONCENTRATIONS DECREASED AND FLUXES INCREASED AS THE PUMPING RATES INCREASED.

THE OSCILLATION OF SURFACE ELEVATION IN A PACIFIC COASTAL TEMPERATE RAISED BOG WAS MONITORED AT MULTIPLE SITES FOR 4-12YEARS IN 8 DIFFERENT PLANT COMMUNITIES OF BOTH PEAT-HARVESTED AND UNHARVESTED SITES TO DETERMINE HOW BOG SURFACE OSCILLATION RELATES TO SITE CONDITIONS. THE MULTIYEAR AVERAGES OF BOG SURFACE OSCILLATION FOR THE DIFFERENT SITES RANGED FROM 2 TO 34CM (MEAN: 10.8CM). IN HARVESTED SITES, SURFACE OSCILLATION WAS LINKED TO A LARGER WATER LEVEL AMPLITUDE AND A SHALLOWER WATER TABLE. IN UNHARVESTED SITES, A SHALLOW WATER TABLE WAS ALSO A STRONG PREDICTOR OF SURFACE OSCILLATION, BUT WATER LEVEL AMPLITUDE WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED TO SURFACE OSCILLATION. THIS DISCREPANCY WAS ATTRIBUTED TO REWETTING AND REGENERATION OF HARVESTED SITES, AS WELL AS HISTORIC DRAINAGE IN MANY OF THE UNHARVESTED SITES THAT REDUCED THE ELASTICITY OF THE PEAT. SURFACE OSCILLATION DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN SOME OF THE PLANT COMMUNITIES, GENERALLY BETWEEN DRIER AND WETTER SITES.

SOILS HAVE BEEN UNDER INTENSIVE ARABLE USE FOR SEVERAL DECADES AND WERE BOTH CULTIVATED, INTER ALIA, WITH CORN, A C4 PLANT. IN 1995, ONE SOIL WAS CONVERTED FROM ANNUAL CROPPING TO PERMANENT CULTIVATION WITH MISCANTHUS X GIGANTEUS, ANOTHER C4 PLANT, WHILE THE OTHER WAS CONVERTED TO PERMANENT C3 GRASSLAND IN 2009. USING DELTA C-13 SIGNATURES, WE ANALYSED THE FRACTIONS OF C4 DERIVED CARBON IN THE SOIL AND IN CO2, DURING ONE MONTH OF SOIL INCUBATION. THIS ENABLED US I) TO ESTIMATE C4-C ACCUMULATION IN BOTH SOILS, AND II) TO ASSESS THE LABILITY OF C4-C CARBON THAT ACCUMULATED EITHER AT LEAST FIVE YEARS PRIOR TO SAMPLING (CURRENT GRASSLAND SOIL) OR UNTIL SAMPLING (CURRENT MISCANTHUS SOIL).

THIS ACCUMULATION RATE IS IN THE RANGE OF RATES FOUND FOR FERTILE MINERAL SOILS CULTIVATED WITH MISCANTHUS.

IN THIS STUDY WE PRESENT THE OUTCOMES OF A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED ON AGRICULTURAL FEN PEAT TO EXAMINE POSSIBLE TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN CELERY GROWTH (AN ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT CROP ON THE AGRICULTURAL PEATLANDS OF EASTERN ENGLAND) AND EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES (CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) AND METHANE (CH4)) AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES (AMBIENT AND AMBIENT +5 DEGREES C), WATER TABLE LEVELS (-30 CM, AND -50 CM BELOW THE SURFACE), AND FERTILISER USE. RAISING THE WATER TABLE FROM -50 CM TO -30 CM DEPRESSED YIELDS OF CELERY, AND AT THE SAME TIME DECREASED THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM CO2 LOSS BY 31%. A 5 DEGREES C TEMPERATURE INCREASE ENHANCED ECOSYSTEM EMISSIONS OF CO2 BY 25% AND INCREASED CELERY DRY SHOOT WEIGHT BY 23% WHILE NOT AFFECTING THE SHOOT FRESH WEIGHT. FERTILISER ADDITION INCREASED BOTH CELERY YIELDS AND SOIL RESPIRATION BY 22%. METHANE EMISSIONS WERE GENERALLY VERY LOW AND NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM ZERO. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT INCREASING THE WATER TABLE CAN LOWER EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND REDUCE THE RATE OF PEAT WASTAGE, BUT REDUCES THE PRODUCTIVITY OF CELERY. IF POSSIBLE, THE WATER TABLE SHOULD BE RAISED TO -30 CM BEFORE AND AFTER CULTIVATION, AND ONLY DECREASED DURING THE GROWING SEASON, AS THIS WOULD REDUCE THE OVERALL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND PEAT LOSS, POTENTIALLY NOT AFFECTING THE PRODUCTION OF VEGETABLE CROPS.

PHYSICAL EXPERIMENTS TO EVALUATE ALTERNATIVE PATTERN FORMATION MECHANISMS ARE LIMITED BY THE LONG TIMESCALES OF PEAT ACCUMULATION AND LOSS, NECESSITATING MODEL-BASED COMPARISONS, WHERE SUPPORT FOR A PARTICULAR MECHANISM IS BASED ON MODEL REPLICATION OF EXTANT PATTERNING AND TRAJECTORIES OF DEGRADATION. HOWEVER, MULTIPLE MECHANISMS YIELD A CENTRAL FEATURE OF RIDGE-SLOUGH PATTERNING (PATCH ELONGATION IN THE DIRECTION OF HISTORICAL FLOW), LIMITING THE UTILITY OF THAT CHARACTERISTIC FOR DISCRIMINATING AMONG ALTERNATIVES. USING DATA FROM VEGETATION MAPS, WE INVESTIGATED THE STATISTICAL FEATURES OF RIDGE-SLOUGH SPATIAL PATTERNING (RIDGE DENSITY, PATCH PERIMETER, ELONGATION, PATCH SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS, AND SPATIAL PERIODICITY) TO ESTABLISH MORE RIGOROUS CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING MODEL PERFORMANCE AND TO INFORM CONTROLS ON PATTERN VARIATION ACROSS THE CONTEMPORARY SYSTEM.

STANDARDISED DELTA C-13 OF AEROBIC LAYERS DIFFER DISTINCTLY BETWEEN SLIGHTLY DEGRADED PESTS AT THE OPEN PEAT BOG AREA, INTERMEDIATELY DEGRADED PEATS AT THE TREE-COVERED EDGE AREAS AND STRONGLY DEGRADED PESTS AT THE FORMER PEAT-CUTTING SITE. DELTA C-13 SIGNATURES OF AEROBIC LAYERS OF STRONGLY DEGRADED PESTS WERE MARKEDLY MORE NEGATIVE COMPARED TO THE SLIGHTLY DEGRADED PEATS BECAUSE OF THE SELECTIVE C-12 LOSSES BY MICROBIAL RESPIRATION. DELTA N-15 WERE MORE POSITIVE AT STRONGLY DEGRADED THAN AT SLIGHTLY DEGRADED SITES IN BOTH, AEROBIC AND ANAEROBIC PEAT LAYERS. THE UNIFORM STABLE ISOTOPE RATIOS IN THE ANAEROBIC LAYERS DEEPER THAN THE LOCAL MAXIMA OF THE ISOTOPIC SIGNATURES SUPPORT THE ASSUMPTION THAT MINOR C-13 FRACTIONATION OCCURS UNDER ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS. DELTA C-13 SLIGHTLY DECLINING WITH DEPTH IN THE WATERLOGGED LAYERS OF STRONGLY DEGRADED PEAT REFLECTS THE PREFERENTIAL UTILISATION AND LOSS OF LABILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS ENRICHED IN C-13.

WE CONCLUDE THAT PEAT DECOMPOSITION STRONGLY AFFECTS THE DELTA C-13 AND DELTA N-15 DEPTH PROFILES OF PEAT BOGS AND MOST LIKELY OVERRIDES OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PLANT SPECIES, LITTER COMPONENTS, ATMOSPHERIC DELTA C-13 SHIFT DURING PEAT FORMATION, TEMPERATURE EFFECTS, OR TYPE OF MYCORRHIZAL SYMBIOSIS.","EFFECTS OF PEAT DECOMPOSITION ON DELTA C-13 AND DELTA N-15 DEPTH PROFILES OF ALPINE BOGS","CATENA","ARTICLE","JUL",2019,"10.1016/j.catena.2019.02.027","GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY; SOIL SCIENCE; WATER RESOURCES","WOS:000466999700001"

THE BEHAVIOR OF COLLOIDS AND ORGANIC COMPLEXES OF TRACE METALS DURING THIS PROCESS IS VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN. IN THIS WORK, WE STUDIED THE INTERACTION OF TWO MODEL HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIA, SOIL PSEUDOMONAS AUREOFACIENS AND AQUATIC PSEUDOMONAS REACTANS, WITH PEAT AND SPHAGNUM MOSS LEACHATES FROM THE PERMAFROST REGION UNDER CONTROLLED LABORATORY CONDITIONS IN NUTRIENT-FREE MEDIA.

NO CHANGES IN AERATION DEPTH OR VEGETATION PARAMETERS WERE DETECTED AS A FUNCTION OF DITCH BLOCKING, TIME SINCE BLOCKING, OR DISTANCE FROM THE DITCH, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NON-SPHAGNUM BRYOPHYTES WHICH HAD LOWER COVER IN QUADRATS ADJACENT TO DITCHES THAT HAD BEEN BLOCKED FOR 5 YEARS. ANALYSIS OF LIDAR DATA AND THE OBSERVED PROXIMITY OF THE WATER TABLE TO THE PEAT SURFACE LED US TO CONCLUDE THAT THE SUBDUED ECOSYSTEM RESPONSES TO DITCH-BLOCKING WERE THE RESULT OF HISTORICAL PEAT SUBSIDENCE WITHIN A 4-5 M ZONE EITHER SIDE OF EACH DITCH, WHICH HAD EFFECTIVELY LOWERED THE PEAT SURFACE TO THE NEW, DITCH INFLUENCED WATER TABLE. WE ESTIMATE THAT THIS PROCESS LED TO THE LOSS OF AROUND 500,000 M(3) PEAT WITHIN THE 38 KM(2) STUDY AREA FOLLOWING DRAINAGE, DUE TO A COMBINATION OF OXIDATION AND COMPACTION. ASSUMING THAT 50% OF THE VOLUME LOSS WAS DUE TO OXIDATION, THIS AMOUNTS TO A CARBON LOSS OF 11,000 MG C OVER THIS AREA, I.E. 3 MG C HA(-1). THE APPARENT 'SELF-REWETTING' OF BLANKET BOGS IN THE DECADES FOLLOWING DRAINAGE HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THEIR RESTORATION AS IT SUGGESTS THAT THERE MAY NOT BE LARGE QUANTITIES OF DRY PEAT LEFT TO REWET, AND THAT THERE IS A RISK OF INUNDATION (POTENTIALLY LEADING TO HIGH METHANE EMISSIONS) ALONG SUBSIDED DITCH LINES. MANY PEATLAND PROCESSES ARE LIKELY TO BE MAINTAINED IN DRAINED BLANKET BOG, INCLUDING SUPPORT OF TYPICAL PEATLAND VEGETATION, BUT INFILLING OF LOST PEAT AND RECOVERY OF ORIGINAL C STOCKS ARE LIKELY TO TAKE LONGER THAN IS GENERALLY ANTICIPATED.

THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE BLAZES ARE SMOLDERING FIRES THAT ARE USUALLY INITIATED IN PERIODS OF DROUGHT AND CAN COMBUST ENTIRE PEATLAND CARBON STORES.

THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE POTENTIAL IMPORTANCE OF SUCH PROCESSES IN SEVERAL PEATLANDS THAT SPAN A GRADIENT FROM HEMIBOREAL TO TROPICAL ECOZONES AND EXPERIENCE A WIDE RANGE OF FIRE RETURN INTERVALS.

THIS PAPER REPORTS A BEFORE-AFTER-CONTROL-INTERVENTION (BACI) STUDY FROM THREE EXPERIMENTAL HEADWATER MICRO-CATCHMENTS IN THE SOUTH PENNINES (UK) REPRESENTING THE FIRST RIGOROUS EXPERIMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF BLANKET PEAT RESTORATION ON CATCHMENT RUNOFF. WE EVALUATE THE HYDROLOGICAL IMPACTS OF TWO STANDARD RESTORATION INTERVENTIONS; REVEGETATION OF BARE PEAT, AND REVEGETATION OF BARE PEAT WITH ADDITIONAL GULLY BLOCKING. FOLLOWING REVEGETATION THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN DEPTH TO WATER TABLE AND AN INCREASE IN THE PREVALENCE OF HILLSLOPE OVERLAND FLOW PRODUCTION. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN STORM RUNOFF COEFFICIENT FOLLOWING EITHER RESTORATION TREATMENT. STORM HYDROGRAPHS FOLLOWING REVEGETATION HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER LAG TIMES (106% INCREASE RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL), REDUCED PEAK FLOWS (27% DECREASE RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL), AND ATTENUATED HYDROGRAPH SHAPES. WITH THE ADDITION OF GULLY BLOCKING THE EFFECT IS ALMOST DOUBLED. LAG TIMES INCREASED BY A FURTHER 94% AND PEAK FLOWS REDUCED BY AN ADDITIONAL 24% RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL. WE ARGUE THAT THE PRIMARY PROCESS CONTROLLING THE OBSERVED CHANGES IN STORM HYDROGRAPH BEHAVIOUR IS RETARDATION OF OVERLAND STORMFLOW DUE TO INCREASED SURFACE ROUGHNESS.

IN ORDER TO RELATE HYDROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS TO KEY EROSION PROCESSES IN HEADWATER PEATLANDS DRAINED FOR FORESTRY, A TWO-YEAR STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN A NESTED SUB-CATCHMENT SYSTEM (TREATED WITH DITCH CLEANING) AND AT TWO REFERENCE SITES. THE TREATED CATCHMENT WAS INSTRUMENTED FOR CONTINUOUS DISCHARGE AND TURBIDITY MONITORING, EROSION PIN MEASUREMENTS OF CHANGES IN DITCH BED AND BANKS AND TIME-INTEGRATED SAMPLING OF SUSPENDED SEDIMENT (SS) COMPOSITION. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT DITCH CLEANING CLEARLY INCREASED TRANSIENT SUSPENDED SEDIMENT CONCENTRATIONS (SSCS) AND SUSPENDED SEDIMENT YIELDS (SSYS), AND RESULTED IN TEMPORARY STORAGE OF LOOSELY DEPOSITED ORGANIC SEDIMENT IN THE DITCH NETWORK. AFTER EXHAUSTION OF THIS SEDIMENT STORAGE, SUBAERIAL PROCESSES AND EROSION FROM DITCH BANKS BECAME DOMINANT IN PRODUCING SEDIMENT FOR TRANSPORT. RECORDED SSCS WERE HIGHER ON THE RISING LIMBS OF EVENT HYDROGRAPHS THROUGHOUT THE STUDY PERIOD, INDICATING THAT SS TRANSPORT WAS LIMITED BY AVAILABILITY OF EROSION-PRONE SEDIMENT. A STRONG POSITIVE CORRELATION (R-2=0.84, P<0.001) BETWEEN RAINFALL INTENSITY (ABOVE A THRESHOLD OF 1MMH(-1)) AND AVERAGE SSC OBTAINED ON THE RISING LIMB OF HYDROGRAPHS FOR THE SUB-CATCHMENT SHOWED THAT SOIL DETACHMENT FROM DITCH BANKS BY RAINDROP IMPACT CAN DIRECTLY INCREASE SSC IN RUNOFF.

A RECENTLY DEVELOPED FLUVIAL BLANKET PEAT EROSION MODEL, PESERA-PEAT WAS APPLIED ACROSS 845 KM(2) OF BLANKET PEATLANDS IN THE NORTH PENNINES OF NORTHERN ENGLAND. THE AIM WAS TO EVALUATE THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF EROSION RATES UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE AND LAND MANAGEMENT SCENARIOS. CLIMATE CHANGE DATA TO THE END OF THE 21ST CENTURY, DERIVED FROM UKCP09 MEDIAN EMISSION PROJECTIONS ALIGNED TO THE UK MET OFFICE'S HISTORICAL METEOROLOGICAL DATASET, WERE DOWNSCALED TO 100 M CELLS. LAND MANAGEMENT SCENARIOS WERE DEVELOPED WHICH INCLUDED INTENSIFIED AND EXTENSIFIED GRAZING, ARTIFICIAL DRAINAGE AND PRESCRIBED BURNING. THE MODELLING RESULTS SHOWED THAT UNDER CURRENT MANAGEMENT, 21ST CENTURY CLIMATE CHANGE WOULD SLIGHTLY INCREASE THE OVERALL FLUVIAL EROSION RATES FOR THE STUDY REGION FROM THE CLIMATIC BASELINE (2.2 T HA(-1) YR(-1)) TO THE 2080S (23 T HA(-1) YR(-1)). HOWEVER, THE PREDICTED RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE WAS SPATIALLY VERY VARIABLE.

HERETO, WE ESTABLISHED RELATIONS BETWEEN DRY MASS RATIOS OF ORGANIC MATTER AND SEDIMENT IN PEAT FORMED IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS. THIS WAS COMBINED WITH A HIGH-RESOLUTION 3D GEOLOGICAL MODEL OF THE SUBSURFACE OF THE NETHERLANDS TO MAP THE PROPORTIONS OF ORGANIC MATTER, CLASTIC SEDIMENT AND VOID SPACE IN PEAT. THE 3D MODEL INDICATES THAT C. 15 KM(3) OF HOLOCENE PEAT IS EMBEDDED IN THE COASTAL-DELTAIC PLAIN SUBSURFACE, OF WHICH C. 1.5 KM(3) CONSISTS OF ORGANIC MATTER, 0.4 KM(3) OF SEDIMENT, AND 13.1 KM(3) OF VOID SPACE. DURING FUTURE HUMAN-INDUCED OXIDATION, THIS PEAT HAS A VOLUMETRIC LOSS POTENTIAL OF 14.6 KM(3), RESPONSIBLE FOR LOCALLY 0.4-6.0 M OF SUBSIDENCE, AND A CO2 EMISSION OF 2.0 GTON.

OWING TO THE UNIQUE MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF PEAT, FINE-SCALE MICROTOPOGRAPHIC EXPRESSIONS OF SURFACE PROCESSES ARE ESPECIALLY PRONOUNCED AND PRESENT A POTENTIALLY RICH SOURCE OF GEOMORPHOLOGICAL INFORMATION, PROVIDING VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO THE STABILITY AND DOMINANT SURFACE PROCESS REGIMES. WE PRESENT A NEW PROCESS-FORM CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK TO RIGOROUSLY DESCRIBE BARE PEAT MICROTOPOGRAPHY AND USE STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION (SFM) SURVEYS TO QUANTIFY ROUGHNESS FOR DIFFERENT PEAT SURFACES. THROUGH THE FIRST GEOMORPHOLOGICAL APPLICATION OF A SURVEY-GRADE STRUCTURED-LIGHT HAND-HELD 3D IMAGER (HHI), WHICH CAN REPRESENT SUB-MILLIMETRE TOPOGRAPHIC VARIABILITY IN FIELD CONDITIONS, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT SFM IDENTIFIES ROUGHNESS SIGNATURES RELIABLY OVER BARE PEAT PLOTS (<1M(2)), ALTHOUGH SOME SMOOTHING IS OBSERVED. ACROSS 55 PLOTS, THE ROUGHNESS OF MICROTOPOGRAPHIC TYPES IS QUANTIFIED USING A SUITE OF ROUGHNESS METRICS AND AN OBJECTIVE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM DERIVED FROM DECISION TREE ANALYSIS WITH 98% SUCCESS.

WATER SAMPLES FROM A HEADWATER, PEAT-COVERED CATCHMENT, WERE COLLECTED OVER A 23MONTH PERIOD AND ANALYZED FOR THE DOC DEGRADATION RATE AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER (DOM) COMPOSITION IN THE CONTEXT OF HYDROCLIMATIC MONITORING. MEASURES OF DOM COMPOSITION INCLUDED C-13 SOLID-STATE NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY, BOMB CALORIMETRY, AND ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS. REGRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE FOR THE COMPOSITION OF THE DOM IN CONTROLLING DEGRADATION WITH DEGRADATION RATES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING WITH THE PROPORTION OF ALDEHYDE AND CARBOXYLIC ACID FUNCTIONAL GROUPS BUT DECREASING WITH THE PROPORTION OF N-ALKYL FUNCTIONAL GROUPS. THE HIGHEST RATES OF DOC DEGRADATION OCCURRED WHEN ALDEHYDE FUNCTIONALITY WAS AT ITS GREATEST AND THIS OCCURRED ON THE RECESSION LIMB OF STORM HYDROGRAPHS.

USING A SPACE-FOR-TIME CHRONOSEQUENCE ACROSS THE 120 YEAR FIRE RETURN INTERVAL AND THREE MAIN HYDROGEOLOGICAL SETTINGS, AND BY INCORPORATING HUMMOCK, HOLLOW AND MARGIN LOCATIONS, CROSS-SCALE VARIABILITY IS STUDIED.

CHARACTERIZING GROUNDWATER RESPONSE TO PRECIPITATION EVENTS IN DIFFERENTLY MANAGED PEATLANDS CAN GIVE INSIGHT INTO ECOHYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES. IN THIS STUDY WE DETERMINED THE GROUNDWATER TABLE RESPONSE RATE FOLLOWING PRECIPITATION EVENTS AT A DRAINED AND A REWETTED FEN TO CHARACTERIZE THE EFFECT OF REWETTING ON HYDROLOGICAL BUFFER CAPACITY. MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE GROUNDWATER TABLE AT THE REWETTED FEN HAS MORE THAN TWO TIMES LOWER RATE OF RESPONSE TO PRECIPITATION EVENTS THAN THAT OF THE DRAINED FEN, EVEN AFTER ADJUSTING FOR ANTECEDENT GROUNDWATER LEVELS. THUS, THE REWETTED FEN DELIVERS A BETTER HYDROLOGICAL BUFFER FUNCTION AGAINST HEAVY PRECIPITATION EVENTS THAN THE DRAINED FEN. WE FOUND THAT FOR THE DEPTHS AT WHICH THE GROUNDWATER INTERACTS WITH INCOMING PRECIPITATION, THE PEAT OF THE REWETTED FEN HAS A HIGHER SPECIFIC YIELD CAUSING GROUNDWATER TO RISE SLOWER COMPARED TO THE RESPONSE AT THE DRAINED FEN. A PERIOD OF 20 YEARS OF REWETTING WAS SUFFICIENT TO FORM A NEW LAYER OF ORGANIC MATERIAL WITH A SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF MACROPORES PROVIDING STORAGE CAPACITY.

THE GENERAL GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO AMELIORATE MANAGEMENT OF VERY SHALLOW PEAT FIELDS (<30 CM) LOCATED WITHIN THE MARGINS OF PEATEXTRACTED BOGS. FIRSTLY, TO ASSIST DECISION MAKING IN PEATLAND MANAGEMENT, BASELINE ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, PEAT PHYSICOCHEMISTRY AND SPONTANEOUS VEGETATION RECOLONIZATION WERE ASSESSED FOR 18 OF THESE FIELDS. THIS FIRST STUDY REVEALED THAT (1) CONCENTRATIONS OF SEVERAL MACRO-NUTRIENTS ARE ALMOST ONE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LOWER FOR UNRESTORED FIELDS THAN PREVIOUSLY CHARACTERIZED NATURAL LAGG HABITATS OF THE SAME REGION, AND (2) THERE IS LITTLE SPONTANEOUS COLONIZATION. IN A SECOND STUDY, PEAT CHEMISTRY AND SOIL/AIR MICROCLIMATE WERE EVALUATED IN PLANTATIONS ESTABLISHED ON SHALLOW RESIDUAL PEAT (A 21-YEAR-OLD LARIX LARICINA PLANTATION AND AN 18-YEAR-OLD PICEA MARIANA PLANTATION) AND COMPARED TO ADJACENT UNRESTORED SHALLOW BARE-PEAT FIELDS. THIS SECOND STUDY SHOWED THAT AFFORESTED PEAT FIELDS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY (1) A SOIL ENRICHED IN NUTRIENTS, NOTABLY IN N, P, AND K, AND (2) A MORE HUMID AND COOLER MICROCLIMATE AT THE SOIL/AIR INTERFACE, WITH LESS DAILY HUMIDITY AND TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT AFFORESTATION IS AN APPROPRIATE APPROACH TO START AN ECOLOGICAL RECOVERY. YET, THE ABSENCE OF NATURAL RECOLONIZATION BY HERBS AND MOSSES IN THE UNDERSTORY OF AFFORESTED PEAT FIELDS SUGGESTS THAT REINTRODUCTION OF APPROPRIATE UNDERSTORY SPECIES SHOULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED IF THE GOAL IS TO RESTORE A FULLY FUNCTIONAL ECOSYSTEM.","MANAGEMENT OF THE MARGINS IN CUTOVER BOGS: ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND EFFECTS OF AFFORESTATION","WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","ARTICLE","APR",2017,"10.1007/s11273-016-9508-9","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; WATER RESOURCES","WOS:000398185800004"

THE FIRE HAZARD IN THESE PEATLANDS CAN BE REDUCED THROUGH PEATLAND REWETTING AND WETLAND RESTORATION, SO MONITORING PEATLAND STATUS IS ESSENTIAL. HOWEVER, LARGE EXPANSES, POOR ACCESSIBILITY, AND FAST PLANT SUCCESSION POSE AS CHALLENGES FOR MONITORING THESE AREAS WITHOUT SATELLITE IMAGES. IN THIS STUDY, A TECHNIQUE INVOLVING MULTISPECTRAL SATELLITE DATA WAS USED TO IDENTIFY SIX LAND COVER CLASSES THAT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR PEATLAND MONITORING USING THE MESCHERA NATIONAL PARK AS THE TESTING AREA. THIS PARK IS THE LARGEST AREA OF ONCE-EXPLOITED AND NOW REWETTED PEATLANDS. HOWEVER, DATA FROM ONE SCANNER ARE OFTEN INSUFFICIENT TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THIS TECHNIQUE.

VEGETATION, AS THE BEST ESTABLISHED INDICATOR GROUP IN PEATLANDS, SHOWED THE WEAKEST CORRELATIONS TO THE TESTED ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS, PROBABLY DUE TO SHORT-TERM CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND A DELAYED RESPONSE OF THE PLANT COMMUNITY. HENCE, THE SET OF MOST RELEVANT ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS CAN ONLY BE REPRESENTED WHEN MULTIPLE TAXA ARE INCLUDED IN AN ASSESSMENT SYSTEM.

USING THESE DATA, TWO MODELLING APPROACHES WERE FIRST APPLIED TO PREDICT THE SEASONAL TRAPPING EFFICIENCY OF THE BASINS, NAMELY THE BROWN EQUATION AND A MULTILINEAR REGRESSION MODEL (MLR). SECONDLY, AN ADDITIONAL APPROACH BASED ON THE HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL MOHID WAS USED TO COMPUTE THE TRAPPING EFFICIENCY OF ONE OF THE BASINS FOR A SINGLE RAIN EVENT. THE BROWN EQUATION, USED WORLDWIDE IN AGRICULTURAL SEDIMENTATION PONDS, PROVED TO BE LESS EFFICIENT IN PREDICTING THE TRAPPING EFFICIENCY OF THE BASINS (R = 0.67, P = 0.1, LEAVE-ONE-OUT RMSE = 47.2%) THAN A MLR MODEL USING THE VOLUME OF THE BASIN, THE SURFACE OF THE HARVESTED CATCHMENT AND THE VON POST DECOMPOSITION DEGREE OF THE PEAT AS PREDICTORS (R = 0.87, P = 0.01, LEAVE-ONE-OUT RMSE = 31.6%). THE DETERMINISTIC MOHID MODEL WAS CAPABLE OF REPRODUCING HIGH FLOW SUSPENDED SEDIMENT CONCENTRATION AT THE BASIN OUTLET, BASED ON MEASURED SETTLING VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION OF THE PEAT THROUGH VICAS PROTOCOL, BUT REQUIRES A GOOD DESCRIPTION OF THE SETTLING VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION ACROSS MULTIPLE HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS TO SIMULATE THE SUSPENDED SEDIMENT CONCENTRATIONS OVER A FULL SEASON IN ORDER TO COMPUTE TRAPPING EFFICIENCY. THE RESULTS PRESENTED HERE PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS ON ERODED PEAT MODELLING AND COULD LEAD TO BETTER DESIGN FORMULAS FOR BASIN CONCEPTION.","COMPARISON OF MODELLING APPROACHES TO ESTIMATE TRAPPING EFFICIENCY OF SEDIMENTATION BASINS ON PEATLANDS USED FOR PEAT EXTRACTION","ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING","ARTICLE","AUG",2019,"10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.04.025","ECOLOGY; ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000468148200007"

COMPARED TO A BUSINESS-AS-USUAL SCENARIO (NO PEATLAND REWETTING), REWETTING OF ALL DRAINED EUROPEAN PEATLANDS UNTIL 2050 USING THE SUGGESTED STRATEGY REDUCES THE CUMULATIVE N2O-N EMISSIONS BY 70%. IN CONCLUSION, THE STATUS OF PEAT DEGRADATION SHOULD BE MADE A PIVOTAL CRITERION IN PRIORITISING PEATLANDS FOR RESTORATION. REWETTING AGRICULTURAL PEATLANDS FIRST IS THE BEST STRATEGY FOR REDUCING CUMULATIVE NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM EUROPEAN PEATLANDS, ACCORDING TO AN ANALYSIS OF SOIL BULK DENSITY AS A PROXY FOR PEAT DEGRADATION.","REWETTING STRATEGIES TO REDUCE NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM EUROPEAN PEATLANDS","COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT","ARTICLE","SEP 11",2020,"10.1038/s43247-020-00017-2","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY; METEOROLOGY & ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES","WOS:000648563200001"

WE USED TRAITS RELATED TO NUTRIENT ACQUISITION STRATEGIES, COMPETITIVENESS, SEED TRAITS, AND USED SINGLE- AND MULTI-TRAIT METRICS. A SEPARATE SET OF VEGETATION RECORDS FROM NEAR-NATURAL FENS WITH DIVERSE PLANT COMMUNITIES WAS USED TO GENERATE REFERENCE VALUES TO AID THE COMPARISONS.

AFTER TOPSOIL REMOVAL COMPETITIVE SPECIES IN PLANT COMMUNITIES HAD DECREASED, WHILE STRESS-TOLERANT SPECIES HAD INCREASED. A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY RULED OUT THE EFFECT OF INITIAL DISTURBANCE. AN ABILITY TO SURVIVE AND GROW IN ANOXIC CONDITIONS WAS ENHANCED AFTER RESTORATION, BUT THE REFERENCE VALUES WERE NOT ACHIEVED.

HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF CULTIVATION TECHNIQUES ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF POTTED ROSEMARY ARE LITTLE KNOWN. PEAT IS TRADITIONALLY USED AS THE ORGANIC GROWING MEDIUM; HOWEVER, DESPITE NUMEROUS ADVANTAGES, ITS USE HAS DETERMINED A DEGRADATION OF PEATLANDS IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE AND AN INCREASE IN GREENHOUSE GASES IN THE ATMOSPHERE. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF IRRIGATION AND PEAT-ALTERNATIVE SUBSTRATES ON THE MORPHOLOGICAL, AESTHETIC AND PRODUCTION CHARACTERISTICS OF POTTED SICILIAN ROSEMARY BIOTYPES WITH DIFFERENT HABITUS TYPES. TWO YEARS, TWO DIFFERENT IRRIGATION LEVELS, THREE PEAT-ALTERNATIVE SUBSTRATES AND THREE TYPES OF ROSEMARY PLANT HABITUS WERE TESTED IN A SPLIT-SPLIT-SPLIT-PLOT DESIGN FOR A FOUR-FACTOR EXPERIMENT. THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THAT IRRIGATION AND SUBSTRATE DETERMINED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES FOR ALL TESTED PARAMETERS. ROSEMARY PLANTS DEMONSTRATED THE BEST PERFORMANCES WHEN IRRIGATION WAS MORE FREQUENT; VICE VERSA, THE GREATEST PERCENT CONTENT IN ESSENTIAL OIL WAS OBTAINED WHEN IRRIGATION EVENTS WERE LESS FREQUENT. THE CHEMICAL-PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PEAT-ALTERNATIVE SUBSTRATES CHANGED WITH DECREASES IN THE PEAT CONTENT AND INCREASES IN THE COMPOST CONTENT. THE ERECT HABITUS BIOTYPE SHOWED THE BEST ADAPTATION CAPACITY TO THE VARIOUS TREATMENTS.

THREE TYPES OF WATERS, WHICH WERE DEFINED BY EXTRACTABILITY, WERE COLLECTED FROM THE PEAT. TWO WATERS WERE EXTRACTED BY COMPRESSING SAMPLES WITH DIFFERENT PRESSURES (SQW1 AND SQW2). THE OTHER WATER WAS OBTAINED BY DISTILLING THE COMPRESSED SAMPLES (DW). H-3 WAS DETECTED IN ALL TYPES OF WATER FROM DEPTHS OF 0-50 CM: THE CONCENTRATIONS IN SQW1, SQW2 AND DW RANGED 1.17-3.07 BQ/L, 0.98-2.03 BQ/L, AND 1.02-1.54 BQ/L, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAXIMUM H-3 CONCENTRATIONS OF SQW1, SQW2 AND DW WERE ALL DETECTED AT A DEPTH OF AROUND 15 CM, WHOSE C-14 AGE COVERS THE YEAR OF THE ATOMIC BOMB EXPERIMENTS. THE H-3 RESULTS OF SQW1/2 INDICATE THAT SQW CONSISTS OF AT LEAST TWO WATERS OF DIFFERENT MOBILITY, WATER FLOWING RAPIDLY DOWNWARD AND IMMOBILE WATER. SPHAGNUM HYALINE CELLS MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IMMOBILE WATER. THE DELTA O-18 AND DELTA H-2 RELATIONSHIP EXHIBITED INDEPENDENT TRENDS BETWEEN SQW AND DW. THE DISTINCT DIFFERENCE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE TWO WATERS AT THE SURFACE (0-5 CM) INDICATES THAT THE TWO WATERS MAY BE SUPPLIED BY PRECIPITATION AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE YEAR, OR ALTERNATIVELY THAT DW COMPRISES PLANT WATER TAKEN IN FROM HYALINE CELLS. THE DELTA O-18 AND DELTA H-2 VALUES OF BOTH SQW AND DW IN THE SHALLOW LAYER INCREASED WITH INCREASING DEPTH, AND IN THE LAYER AROUND 30 CM DEPTH, THOSE OF SQW SHOWED A DISTINCT DECREASE WITH DEPTH. ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION CAUSED BY EVAPORATION AND/OR PLANT UTILIZATION OF WATER AT THE SURFACE LAYER ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE MAIN CAUSES OF SUCH ISOTOPIC VARIATION AT THE SURFACE. EVAPORATION IS LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE IN MUCH DRIER CONDITIONS FOR DW THAN FOR SQW, PROBABLY THROUGH STEMS BY CAPILLARY ACTION. IN SQW FREEZING MAY BE A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE DECREASE OF DELTA O-18 AND DELTA H-2 AROUND 30 CM DEPTH. DW IS ISOTOPICALLY VERY WELL SEPARATED FROM TWO SQW1/2.

EACH BATCH OF PEAT THAT IS REUSED, RESULTS IN A CLEAR REDUCTION IN CO2 EMISSIONS AND A LOWER IMPACT ON THE CLIMATE. AFTER USING GROWING MEDIA FOR ONE CULTIVATION, WE AIM AT REUSING THE SPENT MATERIAL AS GROWING MEDIUM FOR ANOTHER CROP. SPENT PEAT AND PERLITE-BASED GROWING MEDIA FROM STRAWBERRY AND CUCUMBER CULTIVATION WERE UPCYCLED AFTER STEAM TREATMENT. WE TESTED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF STEAMING TO REDUCE PHYTOSANITARY RISKS. THE HYGIENISATION EFFICIENCY OF THE STEAM TREATMENT WAS CONFIRMED: PLANT PATHOGENIC FUNGI, LARVAE OF VINE WEEVILS AND WEED SEEDS ADDED OR ALREADY PRESENT BEFORE THE PROCESS WERE KILLED BY THE STEAM TREATMENT. AS THE UPCYCLED SPENT GROWING MEDIUM ALREADY CONTAINED HIGH NUTRIENT LEVELS, THE FERTILIZER APPLICATION IN THE REUSED GROWING MEDIUM SHOULD BE REDUCED, ESPECIALLY FOR P AND K. FIVE INDICATORS FOR ASSESSING STABILITY OF THE MATERIALS WERE USED: CO2 FLUX MEASUREMENTS, OXYGEN UPTAKE RATE (OUR), BIODEGRADATION POTENTIAL, MINERAL N CONTENT AND RISK FOR N IMMOBILIZATION.

SUBJECTS SUPPLEMENTED DAILY WITH EITHER 1 SERVING OF THE SUPPLEMENT (TRT), WHICH CONSISTED OF 150 MG ANCIENT PEAT AND APPLE EXTRACTS, 180 MG BLEND OF CAFFEINE ANHYDROUS AND PTEROSTILBENE-BOUND CAFFEINE, AND 38 MG B VITAMINS, OR AN EQUAL-VOLUME, VISUALLY-IDENTICAL PLACEBO (PLA) 45 MIN PRIOR TO TRAINING OR AT THE SAME TIME OF DAY ON REST DAYS. SUPERVISED RESISTANCE TRAINING CONSISTED OF 8 WEEKS OF DAILY UNDULATING PERIODIZED TRAINING FOLLOWED BY A 2-WEEK OVERREACH AND A 2-WEEK TAPER PHASE. BODY COMPOSITION WAS ASSESSED USING DEXA AND ULTRASOUND AT WEEKS 0, 4, 8, 10, AND 12. VITAL SIGNS AND BLOOD MARKERS WERE ASSESSED AT WEEKS 0, 8, AND 12. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT GROUP X TIME (P < 0.05) INTERACTIONS WERE PRESENT FOR CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA OF THE RECTUS FEMORIS, WHICH INCREASED IN TRT (+1.07 CM(2)) VERSUS PLA (-0.08 CM(2)), AS WELL AS MUSCLE THICKNESS (TRT: +0.49 CM; PLA: +0.04 CM). A SIGNIFICANT GROUP X TIME (P < 0.05) INTERACTION EXISTED FOR CREATININE (TRT: +0.00 MG/DL; PLA: +0.15 MG/DL) AND ESTIMATED GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE (TRT: -0.70 ML/MIN/1.73; PLA: -14.6 ML/MIN/1.73), WHICH REMAINED WITHIN CLINICAL RANGES, BUT NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATIONS WERE OBSERVED.

BIODEGRADABILITY OF PBAT IS STABLE AT HIGH TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS (50 - 60 DEGREES C) SUCH AS COMPOST ENVIRONMENTS COMPARED TO MILD TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS (25 - 37 DEGREES C) SUCH AS SOIL ENVIRONMENTS. CONSIDERING THAT PBAT COULD BE USED IN BIODEGRADABLE AGRICULTURAL APPLICATIONS SUCH AS MULCHING FILM, IT IS IMPORTANT TO INVESTIGATE THE BIODEGRADATION MECHANISM AT MILD TEMPERATURES. IN THIS STUDY, A PEAT-DEGRADING BACTERIUM ISOLATED FROM A SOIL ENVIRONMENT, DESIGNATED AS STRAIN NKCM 2511, WAS STUDIED IN DETAIL. GENETIC AND BIOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE STRAIN BELONGS TO THE GENUS RHODOCOCCUS IN THE PHYLUM ACTINOBACTERIA. THE STRAIN GREW ONLY IN AEROBIC CONDITIONS AND FORMED A CLEAR ZONE ON A PBAT CONTAINING PLATE IN THE TEMPERATURE RANGE OF 20 DEGREES C TO 30 DEGREES C. BASED ON BIOCHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND (BOD) BIODEGRADATION TESTING, AMONG 3 PBAT COMPONENTS, ADIPICACID AND TEREPHTHALIC ACID RESULTED IN LOW GROWTH RATE OF THE STRAINS (5 % AND 7 %, INCUBATED AT 25 DEGREES C FOR 20 DAYS), WHEREAS 1,4-BUTANEDIOL RESULTED IN GOOD GROWTH OF THE STRAINS (55 %). THE LOW BOD BIODEGRADATION RATE OF PBAT BY THIS STRAIN (7 %) MAY BE DUE TO SUCH LOW RATES OF TEREPHTHALIC AND ADIPIC ACID. ADDITIONALLY, THE PEAT DEGRADATION RATE WAS PROPORTIONAL TO THE GROWTH RATE IN THE PRESENCE OF VARIOUS CARBON SOURCES. THEREFORE, THE STRAIN WAS AN AEROBICALLY MESOPHILIC PBAT-DEGRADING BACTERIUM THAT EXPRESSED THE PBAT-DEGRADING ENZYME CONSTITUTIVELY. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST REPORT ON A PBAT-DEGRADING ACTINOBACTERIAL STRAIN IN MILD CONDITIONS.

THE ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM COMPARED TO CLASSICAL SAMPLING ON THE GROUND AND AT TALL TOWERS IS THE FLEXIBILITY CONCERNING SAMPLING LOCATION, AND IN PARTICULAR THE FLEXIBLE CHOICE OF SAMPLING ALTITUDE, ALLOWING THE STUDY OF THE LAYERING AND MIXING OF AIR MASSES WITH POTENTIALLY DIFFERENT SPATIAL ORIGIN OF AIR MASSES AND METHANE.

METHANE FLUXES ARE MEASURED CONTINUOUSLY AT THE SITE. THEY SHOW HIGH EMISSIONS FROM MAY TO SEPTEMBER, AND A STRONG DIURNAL VARIABILITY. FOR TWO CASE STUDIES ON 23 MAY AND 5 SEPTEMBER 2018, VERTICAL PROFILES OF TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY WERE RECORDED UP TO AN ALTITUDE OF 650 AND 1000 M, RESPECTIVELY, DURING THE MORNING TRANSITION. AIR SAMPLES WERE TAKEN AT DIFFERENT ALTITUDES AND ANALYSED IN THE LABORATORY FOR METHANE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION. THE VALUES SHOWED A DIFFERENT ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION IN THE VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION DURING STABLE CONDITIONS IN THE MORNING (DELTA VALUES OF 51.5% BELOW THE TEMPERATURE INVERSION AT AN ALTITUDE OF 150M ON 23 MAY 2018 AND AT AN ALTITUDE OF 50M ON 5 SEPTEMBER 2018, DELTA VALUES OF 50.1% ABOVE).

QUANTITATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF SOURCES, DISPERSION PATHWAYS, AND DEGRADATION OF DOC PRODUCED IN PEAT BOGS IS IMPORTANT FOR PREDICTIONS OF GLOBAL CHANGE DYNAMICS. HERE WE EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF COMBINING C ISOTOPE RATIOS OF ISOTOPICALLY STRATIFIED, PB-210-DATED PEAT DEPOSITS AND C ISOTOPE RATIOS OF DOC EXPORTED VIA RUNOFF TO DETERMINE THE DEPTH AND AGE OF THE PREDOMINANT DOC SOURCE. IN A POORLY DRAINED, SPHAGNUM-DERIVED PEAT BOG IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, DELTA C-13 VALUES OF BULK PEAT INCREASED DOWNCORE TO A DEPTH OF 10 CM. THE C ISOTOPE SIGNATURES OF FRESH DOC AND BULK PEAT DIFFER ONLY INSIGNIFICANTLY, BECAUSE C ISOTOPE CHANGES IN MATURATING PEAT REQUIRE MULTIPLE MICROBIAL MODIFICATIONS OF THE ORGANIC MATTER TAKING PLACE OVER RELATIVELY LONG TIME PERIODS. BASED ON 41 SAMPLINGS OF RUNOFF, 70% OF EXPORTED DOC ORIGINATED FROM PEAT SUBSTRATE 1 TO 10 YEARS OLD, 2-10 CM DEEP. RECENTLY PHOTOSYNTHESIZED DOC (< 1 YEAR OLD) CONTRIBUTED ABOUT 5% TO RUNOFF DOC, WHEREAS APPROXIMATELY 25% OF EXPORTED DOC WAS DERIVED FROM PEAT LAYERS OLDER THAN 10 YEARS. BECAUSE BIOGENIC METHANE AT THE STUDY SITE CONTAINED ISOTOPICALLY EXTREMELY LIGHT C (DELTA C-13 VALUES OF -64.2 TO -53.2 PARTS PER THOUSAND), IT WOULD SEEM REASONABLE TO EXPECT RESIDUAL DOC FOLLOWING PARTIAL DECOMPOSITION TO BECOME ISOTOPICALLY HEAVIER. A SHORT-TERM LABORATORY INCUBATION OF WET PEAT SAMPLES FROM FOUR DEPTHS AT MID-SUMMER TEMPERATURES INDICATED MORE COMPLICATED DELTA C-13 SYSTEMATICS. THE INITIAL LIMITED AMOUNT OF DOC IN THE LEACHATE WAS ISOTOPICALLY HEAVY, COMPARED TO BULK PEAT, BUT AFTER 18 DAYS DELTA C-13(DOC) BECAME LOWER, CONVERGING TO THE C ISOTOPE SIGNATURE OF BULK PEAT. SUCH DELTA C-13 SYSTEMATICS CAN BE EXPLAINED BY MULTI-STEP ISOTOPE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT REACTION RATES DURING SUBSTRATE DECOMPOSITION.

THE ZARNOWSKIE BOG IS UNDER ACTIVE PROTECTION. A TOTAL OF 24 FLOW BARRIERS WERE INSTALLED IN DRAINAGE DITCHES DURING THE YEARS 2006 AND 2007. THE PURPOSE OF THESE BARRIERS WAS TO PUT A HALT TO WATER OUTFLOW. IN ADDITION, 30 HECTARES OF YOUNG PINE FOREST WERE CLEARED IN ORDER TO DECREASE LOSS OF WATER VIA EVAPOTRANSPIRATION. KLUKI PEAT BOG IS ONLY PARTIALLY PROTECTED BY POLISH LAW. THE LACK OF EFFORTS TO PREVENT OUTFLOW VIA THE CANAL IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE CANAL IS UTILISED TO DRAIN MEADOWS IN THE VICINITY OF THE VILLAGE OF LOKCIOWE OUTSIDE OF THE NATIONAL PARK. PEAT FORMATION NO LONGER OCCURS IN THIS PEAT BOG. THE HYDROLOGICAL CONDITION OF THE BOG IS CATASTROPHIC AS A RESULT OF ITS MAIN CANAL, REFERRED TO AS CANAL C9, WHICH IS 2.5 TO 3.0 M DEEP AND 10 M WIDE IN PLACES. BOTH PEAT BOGS ARE MONITORED FOR FLUCTUATIONS IN GROUNDWATER. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT CHANGES IN WATER LEVELS FLUCTUATE BASED ON SEASON OF THE YEAR AND GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION, WHICH IS ILLUSTRATED QUITE WELL USING THE TWO STUDIED PEAT BOGS. THE WATER RETENTION RATE OF THE ZARNOWSKIE PEAT BOG MAY BE CONSIDERED FAIRLY HIGH AND IS LIKELY TO IMPROVE DUE TO PROTECTIVE MEASURES ENABLED BY POLISH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS.

THE NEED FOR PH NEUTRALISATION INCREASES THE COSTS AND OVERALL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS RELATED TO CHEMICAL PURIFICATION. THE USE OF INDUSTRIAL BY-PRODUCTS CAN DECREASE COSTS WHILE SUPPORTING THE SUSTAINABLE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND THE PRINCIPLE OF A CIRCULAR ECONOMY.

THE INFLUENCE OF THE TIME OF PH ADJUSTMENT RELATIVE TO TIME OF COAGULANT ADDITION (BEFORE COAGULANT, AFTER BUT WITHIN COAGULATION, DURING FLOCCULATION AND AFTER SEDIMENTATION) ON PURIFICATION EFFICIENCY WAS EVALUATED. THE HYPOTHESES THAT THE PHYSICAL FORM OF THE COAGULANT WAS A RELEVANT FACTOR AFFECTING PURIFICATION WAS ALSO ASSESSED.

TOPOGRAPHIC CHANGES WERE MAINLY OBSERVED OVER SHORT-TERM INTERVALS WHEN INTENSE RAINFALL, FLOW WASH, NEEDLE-ICE PRODUCTION OR SURFACE DESICCATION WAS OBSERVED. IN THE LABORATORY, WE APPLIED RAINFALL SIMULATIONS ON PEAT BLOCKS AND COMPARED THE PEAT LOSSES QUANTIFIED BY TRADITIONAL SEDIMENT FLUX MEASUREMENTS WITH SFM DERIVED TOPOGRAPHIC DATA. THE MAGNITUDE OF TOPOGRAPHIC CHANGE DETERMINED BY SFM (MEAN VALUE: 0.7 MM, SD: 4.3 MM) WAS VERY DIFFERENT TO THE AREAL AVERAGE DETERMINED BY THE SEDIMENT YIELD FROM THE BLOCKS (MEAN VALUE: -0.1 MM, SD: 0.1 MM). TOPOGRAPHIC CONTROLS ON SPATIAL PATTERNS OF TOPOGRAPHIC CHANGE WERE ILLUSTRATED FROM BOTH FIELD AND LABORATORY SURVEYS. ROUGHNESS WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED TO POSITIVE TOPOGRAPHIC CHANGE AND WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED TO NEGATIVE TOPOGRAPHIC CHANGE AT FIELD PLOT SCALE AND LABORATORY MACROSCALE. OVERALL, THE IMPORTANCE OF EVENT-SCALE CHANGE AND THE DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SURFACE ROUGHNESS AND THE RATE OF TOPOGRAPHIC CHANGE ARE IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS WHICH WE SUGGEST ARE GENERALIZABLE TO OTHER ENVIRONMENTS.

OUR OBJECTIVES WERE (1) TO ASSESS THE RELIABILITY OF SENTINEL-1 SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (SAR) BACKSCATTER AS A PROXY FOR WATER TABLE DEPTH (WTD); (2) TO DEVELOP A METHOD USING SAR TO ESTIMATE BELOW-GROUND (HYDROLOGICAL) RESILIENCE OF PEATLANDS; AND (3) TO APPLY THE DEVELOPED METHOD TO DIFFERENT SITES AND CONSIDER THE LINKS BETWEEN RESILIENCE AND LAND MANAGEMENT. OUR INFERENCES OF WTD FROM SENTINEL-1 SAR DATA GAVE RESULTS WITH AN AVERAGE PEARSON'S CORRELATION OF 0.77 WHEN COMPARED TO MEASURED WTD VALUES. THE 2018 SUMMER DROUGHT WAS USED TO ASSESS RESILIENCE ACROSS THREE DIFFERENT UK PEATLAND AREAS (DARTMOOR, THE PEAK DISTRICT, AND THE FLOW COUNTRY) BY CONSIDERING THE TIMESCALE OF THE SOIL MOISTURE PROXY RECOVERY. RESULTS SHOW CLEAR AREAS OF LOWER RESILIENCE WITHIN ALL THREE STUDY SITES, WHICH OFTEN CORRESPOND TO AREAS OF HIGH DRAINAGE AND MAY BE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO INCREASING DROUGHT SEVERITY/EVENTS UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE.

THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY WERE TO ANALYZE THE SPATIAL VARIATION OF HYDRO-PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF PEAT SOILS AND TO ESTABLISH PEDOTRANSFER FUNCTIONS (PTFS) TO ESTIMATE THE HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES OF PEAT USING READILY AVAILABLE SOIL PROPERTIES. WE SELECTED THREE STUDY SITES, EACH REPRESENTING A DIFFERENT STATE OF PEAT DEGRADATION (NATURAL, DEGRADED AND EXTREMELY DEGRADED). AT EACH SITE, 72 UNDISTURBED SOIL CORES WERE COLLECTED FROM 5 M BY 5 M GRID CELLS IN AN AREA OF 35 M BY 40 M. THE SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY (KS), SOIL WATER RETENTION CURVES, TOTAL POROSITY, MACROPOROSITY (PORE DIAMETER >30 MU M), BULK DENSITY AND SOIL ORGANIC MATTER CONTENT (SOM) WERE DETERMINED FOR ALL SAMPLING LOCATIONS. THE VAN GENUCHTEN (VG) MODEL PARAMETERS (THETA(S), ALPHA, AND N) WERE OPTIMIZED USING THE RETC SOFTWARE PACKAGE. A STRONG POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN MACROPOROSITY AND KS WAS OBSERVED IRRESPECTIVE OF THE DEGRADATION STAGE OF THE PEAT. HOWEVER, THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MACROPOROSITY AND KS DIFFERED BETWEEN THE NATURAL AND THE DRAINED PEATLANDS. ADDING MACROPOROSITY TO THE PTFS SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVES THE PREDICTION OF K-S AS WELL AS VG PARAMETERS. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SOIL PHYSICAL AND HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES (E.G.

THE GEOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE SPATIAL DEPENDENCE OF SOIL HYDRO-PHYSICAL PROPERTIES VARIES DEPENDING ON THE CONSIDERED PROPERTY AS WELL AS LAND MANAGEMENT (E.G. DRAINAGE). BULK DENSITY AND SOM ARE SPATIALLY DEPENDENT, WHEREAS K-S AND MACROPOROSITY ARE SPATIALLY INDEPENDENT IF THE PEAT IS SEVERELY DEGRADED. IN CONCLUSION, THE PEAT DEGRADATION STAGE PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE AND SHOULD BE GENERALLY CONSIDERED IN THE SPATIAL ANALYSIS OF PEATLANDS.

THE QUESTION WAS AS FOLLOWS: HOW DO DIFFERENT LAND USE TYPES AFFECT THE FLORISTIC COMPOSITION AND RESTORATION OF ABANDONED FEN GRASSLANDS? IN THE EXAMINED SITES WE MEASURED FLORISTIC COMPOSITION AND SOIL PHYSICOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS. THE OBSERVED CHANGES IN THE FLORISTIC COMPOSITION RESULTING FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW TYPE OF LAND USE WERE SIGNIFICANT AND THEY OCCURRED IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WITH THE CESSATION OF MOWING FOR 16 YEARS, THE INTERMITTENTLY WET MOLINIA MEADOWS WERE REPLACED BY TREES AND SHRUBS OF ALDER WOODLANDS (ALNETEA GLUTINOSAE CLASS), AND THE PLANT SPECIES DIVERSITY SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED. THE MOWING OF THE MOLINION MEADOWS ONCE EVERY 2-4 YEARS PROVED TO BE SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT THE ENCROACHMENT OF TREES, BUT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO STOP THE EXPANSION OF MOLINIA CAERULEA.

WE USE CUMULATIVE ENERGY DEMAND, GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP), ACIDIFICATION POTENTIAL, AND EUTROPHICATION POTENTIAL INDICATORS IN A CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS AND EXPLORE HOW THE RE-USE OF OLIVE PITS FOR ENERGY PRODUCTION AND REDUCTION OF COMMERCIAL FERTILIZERS IMPROVES THE ENVIRONMENTAL BALANCE. WE ALSO PRESENT A SCENARIO ANALYSIS THAT INDICATES HOW PARAMETER FLUCTUATIONS AFFECT THE RESULTS.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOUR STUDY SHOWS THAT PEAT'S IMPACTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED FROM 1162.3 TO96.3KG CO2-EQ/MG FOR OPEN WINDROW COMPOST OR 43.1KG CO2-EQ/MG FOR STATIC-PILE COMPOST IN GAS-PERMEABLE BAGS. FOR STATIC-PILE COMPOSTING, THE LACK OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND AND AMMONIA EMISSIONS AND THE DETECTION OF OXYGEN CONCENTRATIONS ABOVE 12% VOL. SUGGEST FULLY AEROBIC CONDITIONS. FUGITIVE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GWP. IN THE CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS FOR STATIC-PILE COMPOSTING, THE AVOIDANCE OF COMPOST SPREADING AND THE CARBON STORAGE EFFECT (DUE TO COMPOST USAGE) CONTRIBUTED 54% OF THE OVERALL IMPACTS TO GWP AND BETWEEN 21 AND 45% TO THE OTHER INDICATORS.CONCLUSIONSTHIS LCA STUDY ILLUSTRATES HOW HORTICULTURISTS CAN IMPROVE THEIR RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES BY RECYCLING OLIVE MILL WASTE MATERIALS.

METABOLIC PATHWAYS IN PEATLAND SOILS ARE IMPRINTED IN STABLE ISOTOPE COMPOSITIONS DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN MICROORGANISM COMMUNITIES AND THEIR METABOLIC PATHWAYS. THEREFORE, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT DEPTH PROFILES OF NITROGEN STABLE ISOTOPE VALUES PROVIDE A PROMISING OPPORTUNITY TO DETECT PEATLAND DECOMPOSITION OR RESTORATION. WE STUDIED FIVE PEATLANDS, NAMELY DEGERN STORMYR (NORTHERN SWEDEN), LAKKASUO (CENTRAL FINLAND) AND THREE MIRES IN THE BLACK FOREST (SOUTHERN GERMANY). AT ALL LOCATIONS, CORES WERE TAKEN FROM ADJACENT DRAINED (OR REWETTED) AND NATURAL SITES TO IDENTIFY DELTA N-15 TRENDS THAT COULD INDICATE CHANGES DUE TO DRAINAGE AND RESTORATION. AT ALL DRAINED (AND REWETTED) SITES WE FOUND A DISTINCT PEAK (""TURNING POINT"") OF THE DELTA N-15 VALUES IN THE CENTER OF THE DRAINED HORIZON. WE DID A FATTY ACIDS (FAS) ANALYSIS TO LINK OUR RESULTS TO MICROBIAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. AS MARKERS, WE DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN ONE FUNGAL-DERIVED FA (C18:2 OMEGA 9C) AND FOUR BACTERIAL-DERIVED FAS. FOR BACTERIA, WE LOOKED FOR ONE GENERAL BACTERIAL-DERIVED FA (C14:0), TWO FAS FOR GRAM-POSITIVE BACTERIA (I-C15:0; A-C15:0), AND ONE FA FOR GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIA (C16:1 OMEGA 9C). IN ACCORDANCE WITH OTHER STUDIES, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT FUNGI DOMINATE THE MICROBIAL METABOLISM IN THE UPPER AEROBIC PEAT HORIZON. THIS IS REFLECTED BY DEPLETED DELTA N-15 VALUES. MOVING DOWNWARDS, THE DRAINED HORIZON CONDITIONS SLOWLY SWITCH TO OXYGEN LIMITATION. CONSEQUENTLY, FUNGAL-DERIVED FAS DECREASE WHEREAS BACTERIAL-DERIVED FAS RISE. THE HIGHEST DIVERSITY OF MICROBIAL-DERIVED FAS IS INDICATED BY THE DELTA N-15 TURNING POINT. BELOW THE DELTA N-15 TURNING POINT, OXYGEN IS INCREASINGLY LIMITED AND CONCENTRATIONS OF ALL MICROBIAL-DERIVED FAS ARE DECREASING DOWN TO THE ONSET OF THE PERMANENTLY WATERLOGGED ANAEROBIC HORIZON.

RELIABLE MAPPING AND QUANTIFICATION OF SITE-SPECIFIC CARBON STOCKS (E.G.

THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE RAISED BOGS, SUCH AS THOSE FOUND IN SOUTH WALES ARE CONSIDERABLE CARBON STORES. THEY ARE, HOWEVER, SUSCEPTIBLE TO CLIMATE WARMING OWING TO THEIR SOUTHERLY LOCATION WITHIN THE UK. ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF PEATLAND CARBON STOCKS HAS BROADER IMPORTANCE BECAUSE WORLD-WIDE PEATLAND CARBON STORES ARE SIGNIFICANT AND THREATENED BY CLIMATE CHANGE, POSING A SUBSTANTIAL CHALLENGE NOT ONLY DUE TO CLIMATE FEEDBACKS IF THIS STORED CARBON IS RELEASED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE, BUT ALSO THE IMPACT ON THE OTHER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE.

WE APPLY THE APPROACH TO THREE OMBROTROPHIC RAISED BOGS IN SOUTH WALES, UK, SELECTED FOR THEIR CONSERVATION VALUE AND THEIR TOPOGRAPHICALLY-CONFINED RAISED BOG FORM. GPR AND LIDAR ARE FOUND TO BE WELL SUITED, RESPECTIVELY, TO MAPPING PEAT THICKNESS AT BOG SCALE AND SURFACE ELEVATION, THUS ALLOWING SURFACE AND BASAL TOPOGRAPHIES TO BE EVALUATED USING GIS.

UNDERSTANDING THESE CONDITIONS IS NECESSARY FOR THE EFFECTIVE RECLAMATION OF DEGRADED PEATLANDS. THREE MEASUREMENT POINTS WERE DESIGNATED IN THE STUDY AREA: ONE ON THE NON-DEGRADED DOME OF THE BOG AND TWO IN POST-MINING AREAS IN DIFFERENT STAGES OF SUCCESSION (SECTOR A WITH PINE AND BIRCH WOODLAND; SECTOR B WITH COTTON-GRASS AND ERICACEOUS SHRUBS). CONTINUOUS MEASUREMENTS OF THE WATER TABLE LEVEL, PRECIPITATION AND AIR TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY WERE PERFORMED BETWEEN MAY AND OCTOBER IN THE YEAR 2016. THE AIR TEMPERATURE THROUGHOUT THE WARM HALF OF THE YEAR SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED THE GROUNDWATER LEVELS, AS IT IS THE MAIN FACTOR DIRECTLY AFFECTING EVAPOTRANSPIRATION. THE EFFECT OF THE AMOUNT OF RAINFALL ON THE WATER LEVEL PROVED SIGNIFICANT IN THE POST-MINING AREAS, BUT NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THE DOME OF THE BOG. UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF AN UNDEGRADED PEAT BOG, THE UPPER LAYER, CONSISTING OF LIVE AND PARTIALLY DECOMPOSED SPHAGNUM MOSSES, LIMITS THE WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS BY REDUCING THE EVAPORATION FROM THE SURFACE DURING PERIODS OF LOW WATER LEVELS, WHICH IS CAUSED BY A HIGH WATER STORAGE CAPACITY AND REDUCED INFILTRATION. IN ADVANCED STAGES OF SECONDARY FOREST SUCCESSION, TREES REDUCE THE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION FROM THE SURFACE, WHICH REDUCES FLUCTUATIONS IN THE WATER LEVEL: HOWEVER. BY TAKING UP A LARGE AMOUNT OF WATER FROM THE DEEPER LAYERS, THEY LOWER IT SIGNIFICANTLY. THE GREATEST EFFECT OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS ON THE WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS OCCURS AT THE STAGE IN WHICH THE BOG IS OVERGROWN BY SHRUBS, WHEN THERE IS NO NATURAL PEAT LAYER.

OUR PROCEDURE WAS DEVELOPED AND TESTED IN A LARGE RIVER BASIN IN FINLAND, PROVIDING INFORMATION FROM INTENSIVELY STUDIED ELTER RESEARCH SITES. TO EVALUATE THE FULL GHG BALANCE, FLUXES FROM NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS (LAKES, RIVERS, AND UNDRAINED MIRES) WERE INCLUDED TOGETHER WITH FLUXES FROM ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES, AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY. WE QUANTIFIED THE FLUXES BASED ON CALCULATIONS WITH AN ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS MODEL (FRES) AND A FOREST GROWTH AND CARBON BALANCE MODEL (PREBAS), AS WELL AS ON EMISSION COEFFICIENTS FROM THE LITERATURE REGARDING EMISSIONS FROM LAKES, RIVERS, UNDRAINED MIRES, PEAT EXTRACTION SITES AND CROPLAND. SPATIAL DATA SOURCES INCLUDED CORINE LAND USE DATA, SOIL MAP, LAKE AND RIVER SHORELINES, NATIONAL FOREST INVENTORY DATA, AND STATISTICAL DATA ON ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES. EMISSION UNCERTAINTIES WERE EVALUATED WITH MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS. ARTIFICIAL SURFACES WERE THE MOST EMISSION INTENSIVE LAND-COVER CLASS. LAKES AND RIVERS WERE ABOUT AS EMISSION INTENSIVE AS ARABLE LAND.

SEVENTEEN RECREATIONALLY ACTIVE MEN AND WOMEN (23.2 +/- 5.9 YEARS; 172.9 +/- 14.3 CM; 82.4 +/- 14.5 KG) UNDERWENT 2 TESTING SESSIONS ADMINISTERED IN A RANDOMIZED, COUNTERBALANCED, DOUBLE-BLIND FASHION. SUBJECTS WERE PROVIDED EITHER MIPS OR PLACEBO (PL) ONE HOUR BEFORE PERFORMING A SPRINT CYCLING PROTOCOL, WHICH CONSISTED OF TEN 5-SECOND ""ALL-OUT"" SPRINTS INTERSPERSED BY 55 SECONDS OF UNLOADED PEDALING. AVERAGE POWER (P-AVG), PEAK POWER (P-PK), AVERAGE VELOCITY (V-AVG), AND DISTANCE COVERED WERE RECORDED FOR EACH SPRINT. SEPARATE LINEAR MIXED MODELS REVEALED DECREMENTS (P < 0.05) COMPARED TO THE FIRST SPRINT IN P-AVG (75-229 W) AND P-PK (79-209 W) THROUGHOUT ALL CONSECUTIVE SPRINTS AFTER THE INITIAL SPRINT DURING PL.

WE FOCUS ON A SET OF UK HABITATS OF RECOGNISED CONSERVATION VALUE, FIRST QUANTIFYING THE CARBON STORED IN THE VEGETATION AND TOP 30 CM OF SOIL IN THESE AREAS. WE ESTIMATE THAT THESE AREAS STORE 0.55 GIGATONNES OF CARBON IN VEGETATION AND SOIL TO A DEPTH OF 30 CM, APPROXIMATELY 30% OF THE UK TERRESTRIAL CARBON STORE TO A SIMILAR DEPTH, ON 20% OF THE LAND AREA. MOST OF THESE HIGH CARBON, HIGH CONSERVATION VALUE HABITATS ARE IN UPLAND AREAS, WITH PARTICULARLY NOTABLE EXTENTS AND MASS OF CARBON IN SCOTLAND. IN THEIR CURRENT CONDITION, WE ESTIMATE THESE AREAS TO EXERT A NET SEQUESTRATION EFFECT OF MORE THAN 8 MILLION TONNES OF CO2 EQUIVALENTS PER YEAR. FURTHERMORE, RESTORATION OF THESE HABITATS FROM THEIR CURRENT, GENERALLY POOR CONDITION COULD RESULT IN AN EXTRA 6-7 MILLION TONNES OF CO2 EQUIVALENTS PER YEAR, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE UK'S TOTAL EMISSIONS OF 455.9 MILLION TONNES CO(2EQ )IN 2017.

PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE ATTRIBUTED DIFFERENCES IN THE TEMPERATURE RESPONSE OF THESE C POOLS TO OVERALL AVAILABILITY OR CHEMICAL COMPLEXITY. HERE, WE ESTIMATED THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE LABILE POOL AS THE DIFFERENCE OF CO2 FROM SOILS WITH ADDED HIGHLY AVAILABLE C SUBSTRATES (ARGININE, GLUCOSE, GLUTAMINE, LYSINE, AND MALTOSE) AND YEAST EXTRACT, AND CO2 FROM SOIL WITHOUT ADDED C. WE ALSO MEASURED THE TEMPERATURE RESPONSE OF THE DECOMPOSITION OF SOIL ORGANIC MATTER (SOM), WHICH ENCOMPASSES BOTH LABILE AND STABLE C (NO ADDED C). SOIL WAS INCUBATED FOR FIVE HOURS USING A TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BLOCK CONSISTING OF 18 DISCRETE TEMPERATURES (SIMILAR TO 8-52 DEGREES C). WE ALSO TESTED TO SEE IF TEMPERATURE RESPONSES DIFFERED BETWEEN THREE CONTRASTING SOILS (ALLOPHANIC, GLEY, AND ORGANIC/DEGRADED PEAT). WE APPLIED MACROMOLECULAR RATE THEORY (MMRT) TO THE R-S DATA TO CALCULATE THE TEMPERATURE OPTIMUM (T-OPT) AND THE INFLECTION TEMPERATURE (T-INF). THE DECOMPOSITION OF SOM HAD AN EXPONENTIAL, ARRHENIUS-LIKE BEHAVIOUR. IN CONTRAST, RESPIRATION OF THE FIVE LABILE C COMPOUNDS HAD A CLEAR AND SIMILAR T-OPT OF AROUND 37 DEGREES C AND T-INF OF 22 DEGREES C. THE TEMPERATURE RESPONSE OF THE MORE LABILE C AND OF THE SOM POOLS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY VARY BETWEEN THE THREE VERY DIFFERENT SOILS, SUGGESTING THAT THESE RESPONSES MIGHT BE INDEPENDENT OF SOIL PROPERTIES. OUR FINDINGS PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE OVERALL TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF SOIL RESPIRATION IS RELIANT ON SORPTION/DESORPTION AND DIFFUSION TO MICROBES - A PROCESS THAT EXHIBITS ARRHENIUS BEHAVIOUR, AND THE BIOLOGICAL DECOMPOSITION OF C BY THESE SOIL MICROBES THAT EXHIBITS MMRT BEHAVIOUR. THE OVERALL RESPONSE TO TEMPERATURE IS GOVERNED BY SUBSTRATE AVAILABILITY AS BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES DOMINATE WHEN SUBSTRATE IS NON-LIMITING, AND PHYSIOCHEMICAL PROCESSES DOMINATE WHEN SUBSTRATE AVAILABILITY IS LIMITING.","SEPARATING THE TEMPERATURE RESPONSE OF SOIL RESPIRATION DERIVED FROM SOIL ORGANIC MATTER AND ADDED LABILE CARBON COMPOUNDS","GEODERMA","ARTICLE","OCT 15",2021,"10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115128","SOIL SCIENCE","WOS:000659471100018"

HOWEVER, THE IMPORTANT SPLIT BETWEEN ARTIFICIAL DRAINAGE AND GROUNDWATER FLOWS AT A FIELD SITE IS USUALLY UNKNOWN. CONSEQUENTLY, THE EFFECTS THAT THE GROUNDWATER SYSTEM'S REDOX STATUS MAY HAVE ON THE FORMS AND TOTAL AMOUNTS OF NITROGEN (N) EXPORTED FROM THE SITE CANNOT BE CONFIDENTLY ASSESSED. WE ADDRESSED THESE DEFICIENCIES BY INVESTIGATING THE EXPORT OF VARIOUS FORMS OF N IN THE ARTIFICIAL DRAINAGE AND THE SHALLOW GROUNDWATER BENEATH TWO DAIRY FARMING SITES (TATUANUI, WAHAROA) WITHIN THE PIAKO RIVER CATCHMENT IN NEW ZEALAND. DUE TO THE VERY LOW HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY OF THE DEGRADED PEAT IN THE SATURATED ZONE PERCHED ON A CLAY AQUICLUDE, NO SIGNIFICANT WATER OR CONTAMINANTS WERE EXPORTED AT TATUANUI VIA THE UNCONFINED SHALLOW GROUNDWATER. ACCORDINGLY, ARTIFICIAL DRAINAGE DISCHARGE INTO THE RECEIVING SURFACE COLLECTOR DRAIN WAS THE ONLY EXPORT PATHWAY FOR N AT THIS SITE. THE SEALED NATURE OF THE GROUNDWATER ZONE RESULTED IN THE ACCUMULATION OF ORGANIC-N AND AMMONIUM-N IN THE PEATY SHALLOW SATURATED ZONE UNDERLYING THE MINERAL SOIL. IN CONTRAST, THE WAHAROA SITE FEATURED A MORE MOBILE SHALLOW GROUNDWATER SYSTEM, WHICH ON AVERAGE CONVEYED APPROXIMATELY EQUAL VOLUMES OF WATER OFFSITE AS THE ARTIFICIAL DRAINAGE SYSTEM. NITRATE (NO3-N) WAS AT BOTH SITES THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF N (76%) LEACHED FROM THE AEROBIC SOIL PROFILE AND DISCHARGED THROUGH THE ARTIFICIAL DRAINAGE. AS THE SHALLOW GROUNDWATER WAS AT BOTH SITES IN A REDUCED REDOX STATE, ANY NO3-N LEACHED FROM THE ROOTZONE INTO THE SATURATED ZONE WAS CONSUMED. ACCORDINGLY, EVEN THE MOBILE SHALLOW GROUNDWATER AT WAHAROA DID NOT CONVEY SIGNIFICANT NO3-N. THE NO3-N CONSUMPTION IN THE REDUCED GROUNDWATER PRESUMABLY OCCURRED DUE TO DISSIMILATORY NO3-N REDUCTION (CONCOMITANT INCREASES IN AMMONIUM-N CONCENTRATIONS, WITH NO ORGANIC MATERIAL AVAILABLE FOR MINERALISATION IN THE SATURATED ZONE) AND MICROBIAL DENITRIFICATION (PRODUCING GASEOUS FORMS OF N). THE NO3-N REDUCTIONS IN THE GROUNDWATER RESULTED IN THE AVERAGE TOTAL N EXPORTS VIA THE SHALLOW GROUNDWATER PATHWAY AT THE WAHAROA SITE BEING SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER (31% OF THE EXPORTED N) THAN IN THE ARTIFICIAL DRAINAGE (69%). THIS IS DESPITE BOTH PATHWAYS EXPORTING SIMILAR WATER VOLUMES. BECAUSE OF THE NO3-N CONSUMPTION IN THE REDUCED SHALLOW GROUNDWATER AT WAHAROA, OVER 98% OF THE N EXPORTED THROUGH THIS PATHWAY WAS EITHER AS AMMONIUM-N OR ORGANIC-N.","THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HYDROLOGICAL PATHWAYS IN EXPORTING NITROGEN FROM GRAZED ARTIFICIALLY DRAINED LAND","JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY","ARTICLE","JUN",2021,"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126218","ENGINEERING, CIVIL; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY; WATER RESOURCES","WOS:000652835600082"

BOTH PROTECTED AREAS REPRESENT AN ENTIRE NATURAL-ANTHROPOGENIC AREA CREATED IN 1992 TO PRESERVE THE UNIQUE FORESTS AND WETLANDS OF THE MESHCHERA LOWLAND, AND TO RESTORE FOREST-MARSH TERRITORIES DAMAGED BY DRAINING AND LONG-TERM EXTRACTION OF PEAT. BOTH THE NATIONAL PARKS ARE LOCATED IN THE CENTRE OF THE MESHCHERA LOWLAND, IN THE BASIN OF THE RIVER PRA (LEFT-SIDE TRIBUTARY OF THE RIVER OKA), AND ITS TRIBUTARIES-THE RIVER BUZHA AND THE RIVER POL. IN 2008-2018, WE STUDIED THE LICHEN DIVERSITY USING THE TRADITIONAL ROUTE METHOD WITH MORE DETAILED STUDIES WITHIN 64 SAMPLE PLOTS. THE FOLLOWING HABITAT TYPES WERE INSPECTED: PINE FORESTS, MIXED FORESTS AND SMALL-LEAVED FORESTS, FLOODPLAIN OAK FOREST, SWAMPS, MEADOWS AND HEATHS, SHORES OF WATER BODIES, AND ANTHROPOGENIC BIOTOPES. MATERIAL OF PREVIOUS STUDIES WAS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. AN ANNOTATED LIST INCLUDED 199 LICHEN SPECIES AND EIGHT NON-LICHENISED FUNGUS-RELATED SPECIES WHICH ARE TRADITIONALLY COUNTED IN LICHEN LISTS. THEY BELONG TO 88 GENERA AND 43 FAMILIES. THE SIMILARITY OF THE LICHEN LISTS OF THE TWO NATIONAL PARKS IS 0.63 ACCORDING TO THE SORENSEN-DICE INDEX.

OUR GOAL IS TO STIMULATE DISCUSSION OF THE FACTORS CONTROLLING DISTRIBUTIONS OF C-4 PLANTS TODAY, HISTORICALLY, AND UNDER FUTURE ELEVATED CO2 ENVIRONMENTS. UNDERSTANDING THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF C-3/C-4 PLANTS IMPACTS NOT ONLY PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY, BUT ALSO THE DISTRIBUTION, EVOLUTION, AND MIGRATION OF BOTH INVERTEBRATES AND VERTEBRATES THAT GRAZE ON THESE PLANTS. SIXTEEN SEPARATE STUDIES ALL INDICATE THAT THE CURRENT DISTRIBUTIONS OF C-4 MONOCOTS ARE TIGHTLY CORRELATED WITH TEMPERATURE: ELEVATED TEMPERATURES DURING THE GROWING SEASON FAVOR C-4 MONOCOTS. IN CONTRAST, THE SEVEN STUDIES ON C-4 DICOT DISTRIBUTIONS SUGGEST THAT A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETER, SUCH AS ARIDITY (COMBINATION OF TEMPERATURE AND EVAPORATIVE POTENTIAL), MORE CLOSELY DESCRIBES THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS. DIFFERENCES IN THE TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF THE QUANTUM YIELD FOR CO2 UPTAKE (LIGHT-USE EFFICIENCY) OF C-3 AND C-4 SPECIES RELATE WELL TO OBSERVED PLANT DISTRIBUTIONS AND LIGHT-USE EFFICIENCY IS THE ONLY MECHANISM THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO EXPLAIN DISTRIBUTIONAL DIFFERENCES IN C-3/C-4 MONOCOTS. MODELING OF C-3 AND C-4 LIGHT-USE EFFICIENCIES UNDER DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2 AND TEMPERATURE PREDICTS THAT C-4-DOMINATED ECOSYSTEMS SHOULD NOT HAVE EXPANDED UNTIL ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATIONS REACHED THE LOWER LEVELS THAT ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE EXISTED BEGINNING NEAR THE END OF THE MIOCENE. AT THAT TIME, PALAEOCARBONATE AND FOSSIL DATA INDICATE A SIMULTANEOUS, GLOBAL EXPANSION OF C-4-DOMINATED GRASSLANDS. THE C-4 MONOCOTS GENERALLY HAVE A HIGHER QUANTUM YIELD THAN C-4 DICOTS AND IT IS PROPOSED THAT LEAF VENATION PATTERNS PLAY A ROLE IN INCREASING THE LIGHT-USE EFFICIENCY OF MOST C-4 MONOCOTS. THE REDUCED QUANTUM YIELD OF MOST C-4 DICOTS IS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR RARITY, AND IT IS SUGGESTED THAT C-4 DICOTS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SELECTED UNTIL CO2 CONCENTRATIONS REACHED THEIR LOWEST LEVELS DURING GLACIAL MAXIMA IN THE QUATERNARY. GIVEN THE INTRINSIC LIGHT-USE EFFICIENCY ADVANTAGE OF C-4 MONOCOTS, C-4 DICOTS MAY HAVE BEEN LIMITED IN THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE WARMEST ECOSYSTEMS, SALINE ECOSYSTEMS, AND/OR TO HIGHLY DISTURBED ECOSYSTEMS. ALL C-4 PLANTS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE OVER C-3 PLANTS UNDER LOW ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONDITIONS AND ARE PREDICTED TO HAVE EXPANDED SIGNIFICANTLY ON A GLOBAL SCALE DURING FULL-GLACIAL PERIODS, ESPECIALLY IN TROPICAL REGIONS. BOG AND LAKE SEDIMENT CORES AS WELL AS PEDOGENIC CARBONATES SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT C-4 ECOSYSTEMS WERE MORE EXTENSIVE DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM AND THEN DECREASED IN ABUNDANCE FOLLOWING DEGLACIATION AS ATMOSPHERIC CO2 LEVELS INCREASED.","C-4 PHOTOSYNTHESIS, ATMOSPHERIC CO2 AND CLIMATE","OECOLOGIA","REVIEW","NOV",1997,"10.1007/s004420050311","ECOLOGY","WOS:A1997YF42100001"
"ALLEN JRL, 2000, QUATERNARY SCI REV","ALLEN JRL","SALT MARSHES, MOST NOW EMBANKED, TOGETHER WITH GENETICALLY RELATED WETLANDS AND HIGH INTERTIDAL FLATS, MAKE A MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE LOWLAND COASTS OF NORTHWEST EUROPE. THEY OCCUR IN MANY DIFFERENT CONTEXTS, BUT CHIEFLY ON OPEN AND BARRIER COASTS AND IN ESTUARIES AND EMBAYMENTS, AND RANGE GREATLY IN SCALE, FROM A MODEST TOTAL THAT MEASURE HUNDREDS OF SQUARE KILOMETRES IN INDIVIDUAL EXTENT, TO AN ENORMOUS NUMBER EACH OF AN AREA NO GREATER THAN TENS TO A FEW HUNDRED HECTARES. THESE MARSHES AND ASSOCIATED ENVIRONMENTS ARE UNDER COMPLEX NATURAL CONTROLS AND EXPERIENCED FROM THE MID-HOLOCENE ONWARD HUMAN EXPLOITATION AND, INCREASINGLY, INTERFERENCE. THE MAIN EXTERNAL CONTROLS ARE THE SEA-LEVEL, TIDAL AND SEDIMENT-SUPPLY REGIMES. INTRINSIC INFUENCES ARE PROVIDED BY THE HALOPHYTIC VEGETATION AND SEDIMENT AUTOCOMPACTION. UPWARD SEA-LEVEL MOVEMENTS AND AUTOCOMPACTION COMBINE TO PROVIDE ACCOMODATION SPACE WITHIN WHICH MARSHES BUILD UPWARD. FIELD DATA AND SIMULATION MODELLING SHOW THAT YOUTHFUL MINERALOGENIC MARSHES GROW UP RAPIDLY AND CAN MATURE WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YEARS OF INCEPTION. THEY CONSIST OF A VEGETATED PLATFORM DISSECTED TYPICALLY BY EXTENSIVE NETWORKS OF BLIND-ENDED, BRANCHING TIDAL CREEKS AND GULLIES. THE HOW-RESISTANT SURFACE VEGETATION, SHAPING THE COMBINED WAVE-TIDE BOUNDARY LAYER ON THE PLATFORMS, BOTH TRAPS AND BINDS TIDALLY INTRODUCED MINERAL SEDIMENT, BUT ALSO CONTRIBUTES AN ORGANIC COMPONENT OF INDIGENOUS ORIGIN TO THE DEPOSIT. WHEN SEA-LEVEL BECOMES STABLE OR FALLS, HOWEVER, IN RESPONSE TO CENTURY-MILLENNIAL SCALE FLUCTUATIONS, THE ORGANIC SEDIMENT COMPONENT BECOMES DOMINANT AND MINERALOGENIC MARSHES ARE TRANSFORMED INTO ORGANOGENIC ONES. ORGANOGENIC MARSHES NORMALLY DISPLAY A CONSIDERABLE RANGE OF SUB-ENVIRONMENTS WHICH CREATE MUCH SPATIAL VARIATION IN THE PEAT FACIES WHICH ACCUMULATE. AT AN ADVANCED STAGE, DOMED RAISED BOGS, RISING SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE THE GENERAL LANDSCAPE, MAY APPEAR ON THE MARSHES. BECAUSE PEAT IS SUCH A POROUS AND PERMEABLE SEDIMENT, AND THERE IS LITTLE OR NO TIDAL INUNDATION, ORGANOGENIC MARSHES IN NORTHWEST EUROPE TYPICALLY LACK SURFACE CHANNELS FOR INTERNAL DRAINAGE. THE STRATIGRAPHIC SEQUENCES ACCUMULATED DURING THE HOLOCENE BENEATH COASTAL MARSHES AND HIGH TIDAL FLATS TYPICALLY PRESENT AN ALTERNATION ON A VERTICAL SCALE OF DECIMETRES TO METRES OF SILTS (MINERALOGENIC MARSHES, HIGH INTERTIDAL MUDFLATS) AND PEATS (ORGANOGENIC HIGHEST INTERTIDAL-SUPRATIDAL MARSHES). COASTAL BARRIERS AND SOME CHANNELS ARE REPRESENTED BY LOCAL ACCUMULATIONS OF SAND AND/OR GRAVEL. THE SILTS AND PEATS FORM COUPLETS WHICH ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE RELATED TO FLUCTUATIONS OF SEA-LEVEL ABOUT THE GENERAL UPWARD TREND. FIELD INVESTIGATIONS AND MODELLING SHOW THAT, IN AREAS WHERE MARSHES ARE MATURE, THE UPWARD CHANGE FROM AN ORGANOGENIC TO A SEQUENCE OF MINERALOGENIC MARSHES (TRANSGRESSIVE OVERLAPS) IS ACCOMPANIED BY THE INITIATION AND INVASIVE DEVELOPMENT OF A BRANCHING NETWORK OF TIDAL CREEKS. THESE DECAY AND INFILL DURING THE REVERSAL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL SEQUENCE AND THE APPROACH, EXPRESSED AS A SERIES OF REPRESSIVE OVERLAPS, OF THE NEXT SET OF PEAT-FORMING CONDITIONS. THE OPERATION OF THE CONTINUOUS, PROGRESSIVE, IRREVERSIBLE AND ASYMPTOTIC PROCESS OF SEDIMENT AUTOCOMPACTION EXERTS A MAJOR, SECONDARY CONTROL ON DEPOSITIONAL REGIMES AND MARSH BEHAVIOUR. A VARIETY OF LOCAL RESPONSES ARE CONSEQUENTLY POSSIBLE IN AN EXTENSIVE MARSH, EVEN THOUGH THE MARSH MAY BE EVERYWHERE IN DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM WITH ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. AUTOCOMPACTION ALSO STRONGLY SHAPES THE CHARACTER OF HOLOCENE COASTAL SEQUENCES AS NOW PERCEIVED, INTRODUCING SIGNIFICANT STRATIGRAPHIC DISTORTIONS AND DISPLACEMENTS WHICH, FOR THE TIME BEING, LIMIT THE ACCURACY OF SEA-LEVEL CURVES AND RATES OF SEA-LEVER CHANGE BASED ON DATED INTERCALATED PEATS. PREHISTORIC HUMANS BENEFITTED FROM THE RESOURCES OF COASTAL SALT MARSHES, ESPECIALLY AT THE TIMES WHEN PEAT MARSHES BEGIN TO BE TRANSGRESSED. FEAT DOMES NOT YET FULLY COLLAPSED MAY HAVE PROVIDED VANTAGE POINTS FOR SEASONAL OCUPANCY OR EVEN SETTLEMENT FROM WHICH THE RICHER RESOURCE OF THE MINERALOGENIC MARSHES DEVELOPING ON LOWER GROUND COULD BE EXPLOITED. INCREASING HUMAN INTERFERENCE ON SALT MARSHES OVER THE LAST MILLENNIUM, CHIEFLY THROUGH WHOLESALE LAND-CLAIM AND SET-BACK, AUGMENTED BY RISING SEA LEVELS AND CONTINUING AUTOCOMPACTION, HAS LED TO A VARIETY OF POORLY UNDERSTOOD BUT GENERALLY DELETERIOUS EFFECTS IN THE LOWLAND COASTAL ZONE. THESE INCLUDE MAJOR CHANGES TO TIDAL AND SEDIMENTARY REGIMES. (C) 2000 ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD.

IN PARTICULAR, IT HAS BEEN QUESTIONED WHETHER NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS ARE MAINLY SPECIES' TRAITS OR MAINLY DETERMINED BY NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY, AND WHETHER PLANT SPECIES HAVE SIMILAR OR DIFFERENT RELATIVE NUTRIENT REQUIREMENTS. THIS REVIEW EXAMINES HOW NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS CONCENTRATION AND THE N:P RATIO IN WETLAND PLANTS VARY AMONG SPECIES AND SITES, AND HOW THEY ARE RELATED TO NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY AND LIMITATION. WE ANALYSE DATA FROM FIELD STUDIES IN EUROPEAN NON-FORESTED WETLANDS, FROM FERTILISATION EXPERIMENTS IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND FROM GROWTH EXPERIMENTS WITH WETLAND PLANTS. OVERALL, THE P CONCENTRATION WAS MORE VARIABLE THAN THE N CONCENTRATION, WHILE VARIATION IN NT RATIOS WAS INTERMEDIATE. FIELD DATA SHOWED THAT THE N CONCENTRATION VARIES MORE AMONG SPECIES THAN AMONG SITES, WHEREAS THE N:P RATIO VARIES MORE AMONG SITES THAN AMONG SPECIES, AND THE P CONCENTRATION VARIES SIMILARLY AMONG BOTH. SIMILAR PATTERNS OF VARIATION WERE FOUND IN FERTILISATION EXPERIMENTS AND IN GROWTH EXPERIMENTS UNDER CONTROLLED NUTRIENT SUPPLY. NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS AND N:P RATIOS IN THE VEGETATION WERE POORLY CORRELATED WITH VARIOUS MEASURES OF NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY IN SOIL, BUT THEY CLEARLY RESPONDED TO FERTILISATION IN THE FIELD AND TO NUTRIENT SUPPLY IN GROWTH EXPERIMENTS. IN THESE EXPERIMENTS, BIOMASS N:P RATIOS RANGED FROM 3 TO 40 AND PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE RELATIVE AVALLABILITIES OF N AND P, ALTHOUGH NT RATIOS OF PLANTS GROWN AT THE SAME NUTRIENT SUPPLY COULD VARY THREE-FOLD AMONG SPECIES. THE EFFECTS OF FERTILISATION WITH N OR P ON THE BIOMASS PRODUCTION OF WETLAND VEGETATION WERE WELL RELATED TO THE N:P RATIOS OF THE VEGETATION IN UNFERTILISED PLOTS, BUT NOT TO N OR P CONCENTRATIONS, WHICH SUPPORTS THE IDEA THAT NT RATIOS, RATHER THAN N OR P CONCENTRATIONS, INDICATE THE TYPE OF NUTRIENT LIMITATION. HOWEVER, OTHER LIMITING OR STRESSING FACTORS MAY INFLUENCE N:P RATIOS, AND THE RESPONSES OF INDIVIDUAL PLANT SPECIES TO FERTILISATION CANNOT BE PREDICTED FROM THEIR N:P RATIOS.

FIRST, WE ASSESS THE CAPABILITY OF A SPECIFIC ORGANIC AMENDMENT TO CONTROL DIFFERENT DISEASES; SECOND, WE INVESTIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF ORGANIC MATTER (OM) DECOMPOSITION ON DISEASE SUPPRESSIVENESS; AND THIRD, WE SEARCH FOR PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS ABLE TO IDENTIFY SUPPRESSIVE OM. OM WAS FOUND TO BE CONSISTENTLY SUPPRESSIVE TO DIFFERENT PATHOGENS IN ONLY A FEW STUDIES WHERE A LIMITED NUMBER OF PATHOGENS WERE TESTED. IN THE MAJORITY OF STUDIES A MATERIAL SUPPRESSIVE TO A PATHOGEN WAS INEFFECTIVE OR EVEN CONDUCIVE TO OTHER PATHOGENS, SUGGESTING THAT OM SUPPRESSIVENESS IS OFTEN PATHOGEN-SPECIFIC.

PEAT SUPPRESSIVENESS GENERALLY DECREASED DURING DECOMPOSITION, WHILE RESPONSES OF COMPOSTS AND CROP RESIDUES WERE MORE COMPLEX. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE MANY INTERACTIONS OF CONTRIBUTING FACTORS (OM QUALITY, MICROBIAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, PATHOSYSTEM TESTED AND DECOMPOSITION TIME), IT WAS DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC PREDICTORS OF DISEASE SUPPRESSION. AMONG THE 81 PARAMETERS ANALYSED, ONLY SOME OF THE 643 CORRELATIONS SHOWED A CONSISTENT RELATIONSHIP WITH DISEASE SUPPRESSION. THE RESPONSE OF PATHOGEN POPULATIONS TO OM AMENDMENTS WAS A RELIABLE FEATURE ONLY FOR SOME ORGANIC MATTER TYPES (E.G.

PRIMARY ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO ELEMENTS IN COAL THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING EXTRACTED FROM COAL AS RAW MATERIAL (GE AND U) OR HAVE, IN OUR OPINION, THE BEST CHANCE FOR SUCH USE (REE, AG, AU, AND PGE). COALS WITH ANOMALOUSLY HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF OTHER METALS HAVING POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC BY-PRODUCT RECOVERY (BE, SC, V, GA, SB, CS, MO, W, AND RE) ARE BRIEFLY CONSIDERED. ORIGINAL DATA AND A SURVEY OF THE LITERATURE INDICATE THAT METALLIFEROUS COALS ARE IN MANY COAL BASINS. ORE FORMATION IN COAL-BEARING STRUCTURES MAY OCCUR DURING PEAT ACCUMULATION, DURING DIAGENESIS OF THE ORGANIC MATTER, OR BY EPIGENESIS. VARIOUS METALS ARE SUPPLIED TO SEDIMENTARY BASINS AS MINERALS THAT ARE TRANSPORTED BY WATER AND WIND OR AS IONIC SPECIES IN SURFACE WATER AND DESCENDING AND ASCENDING UNDERGROUND WATER AND MAY BE INCORPORATED INTO PEAT OR COALS. THE MODES OF OCCURRENCE OF METALS IN THE ENRICHED COALS ARE DIVERSE. THE DATA PRESENTED IN THIS REVIEW INDICATES THAT METALLIFEROUS COALS SHOULD BE REGARDED AS PROMISING FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY FOR BY-PRODUCTS IN THE COURSE OF COAL MINING AND COMBUSTION.

THE CORRESPONDINGLY REDUCED DELIVERY OF NUTRIENTS TO THE BIOSPHERE CAUSED FURTHER INCREASES IN CO2 AND WARMING. MELTING OF POLAR ICE CURTAILED SINKING OF O-2(-) AND NUTRIENT-RICH COLD BRINES WHILE POLE-TO-EQUATOR THERMAL GRADIENTS WEAKENED. WIND SHEAR AND ASSOCIATED WIND-DRIVEN UPWELLING LESSENED, FURTHER DIMINISHING PRODUCTIVITY AND CARBON BURIAL. AS THE EARTH WARMED, DRY CLIMATES EXPANDED TO MID-LATITUDES, CAUSING LATITUDINAL EXPANSION OF THE FERREL CIRCULATION CELL AT THE EXPENSE OF THE POLAR CELL. INCREASED COASTAL EVAPORATION GENERATED O-2(-) AND NUTRIENT-DEFICIENT WARM SALINE BOTTOM WATER (WSBW) AND DELIVERED IT TO A WEAKLY CIRCULATING DEEP OCEAN. WARM, DEEP CURRENTS DELIVERED EVER MORE HEAT TO HIGH LATITUDES UNTIL POLAR SINKING OF COLD WATER WAS REPLACED BY UPWELLING WSBW. WITH THE LOSS OF POLAR SINKING, THE OCEAN WAS RAPIDLY FILLED WITH WSBW THAT BECAME INCREASINGLY ANOXIC AND FINALLY EUXINIC BY THE END OF THE PERMIAN. RAPID INCURSION OF WSBW COULD HAVE PRODUCED SIMILAR TO 20 M OF THERMAL EXPANSION OF THE OCEANS, GENERATING THE WELL-DOCUMENTED MARINE TRANSGRESSION THAT FLOODED EMBAYMENTS IN DRY, HOT PANGAEAN MID-LATITUDES. THE FLOODING FURTHER INCREASED WSBW PRODUCTION AND ANOXIA, AND BROUGHT THAT ANOXIC WATER ONTO THE SHELVES. RELEASE OF CO2 FROM THE SIBERIAN TRAPS AND METHANE FROM CLATHRATES BELOW THE WARMING OCEAN BOTTOM SHARPLY ENHANCED THE ALREADY STRONG GREENHOUSE. INCREASINGLY FREQUENT AND POWERFUL CYCLONIC STORMS MINED UPWELLING HIGH-LATITUDE HEAT AND RELEASED IT TO THE ATMOSPHERE. THAT HEAT, TRAPPED BY OVERLYING CLOUDS OF ITS OWN MAKING, SUGGESTS COMPLETE BREAKDOWN OF THE DRY POLAR CELL. RESULTING RAPID AND INTENSE POLAR WARMING CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO EXTINCTION OF THE REMAINING LATEST PERMIAN COAL FORESTS THAT COULD NOT MIGRATE ANY FARTHER POLEWARD BECAUSE OF LIGHT LIMITATIONS. LOSS OF WATER STORED BY THE FORESTS LED TO AQUIFER DRAINAGE, ADDING ANOTHER SIMILAR TO 5 M TO THE TRANSGRESSION. NON-PEAT-FORMING VEGETATION SURVIVED AT THE NEWLY MOIST POLES. CLIMATE FEEDBACK FROM THE COAL-FOREST EXTINCTION FURTHER INTENSIFIED WARMTH, CONTRIBUTING TO DELAYED BIOTIC RECOVERY THAT GENERALLY DID NOT BEGIN UNTIL MID-TRIASSIC, BUT APPEARS TO HAVE RESUMED FIRST AT HIGH LATITUDES LATE IN THE EARLY TRIASSIC. CURRENT QUANTITATIVE MODELS FAIL TO GENERATE HIGH-LATITUDE WARMTH AND SO DO NOT PRODUCE THE CHAIN OF EVENTS WE OUTLINE IN THIS PAPER.

PEATLAND EFFECTS ON CARBON CYCLING INVOLVE CHANGES IN BOTH LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. THE RATE OF C SEQUESTRATION DECLINES AS A PEAT DEPOSIT GROWS, AND METHANE EMISSION INCREASES AS WET MICROHABITATS EXPAND IN AREA. WE EXAMINE THE THEORETICAL BASIS, UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR TWO HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL MODELS OF PEATLAND FORM AND DEVELOPMENT: CLYMO'S BOG GROWTH MODEL (BGM) AND INGRAM'S GROUNDWATER MOUND HYPOTHESIS (GMH). OUR DETAILED THEORETICAL ANALYSIS REVEALS PREVIOUSLY UNRECOGNIZED CONSEQUENCES OF THE MODELS AND, FOR THE BGM, UNREALISTICALLY STRINGENT CONDITIONS FOR APPLICATION. OUR REVIEW OF MODEL ASSUMPTIONS AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IDENTIFIES THE PRINCIPAL LIMITATIONS OF THESE MODELS: THEY IGNORE SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY IN PEATLAND STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION, FAST PROCESSES OCCURRING NEAR THE PEATLAND SURFACE, AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PEAT ACCUMULATION AND HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. AS A RESULT, THESE MODELS ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE EFFECTS OF BOG GROWTH ON HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS OR PEAT-FORMING PROCESSES. WE INTRODUCE FIVE CONCEPTUAL MODELS OF PEATLAND DEVELOPMENT THAT DIFFER IN HOW BOG SIZE AND SHAPE CHANGE OVER TIME, AND WE EXAMINE THE CONSEQUENCES OF EACH MODEL FOR HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. THIS EXERCISE SHOWS HOW BOG HEIGHT GROWTH AND LATERAL EXPANSION CHANGE THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS CONSTRAINING PEATLAND DYNAMICS, AND SO DETERMINE THE DIRECTION OF ECOSYSTEM DEVELOPMENT. WE LINK PEATLAND PROPERTIES TO THE FOUR GENERAL PROPERTIES OF ''COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS'' (CAS): SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY, LOCALIZED FLOWS, SELF-ORGANIZING STRUCTURE AND NONLINEARITY. WE ALSO PRESENT A FRAMEWORK FOR MODELING PEATLANDS AS CAS. IN THIS FRAMEWORK, THE SYSTEM IS DISAGGREGATED, BOTH VERTICALLY AND HORIZONTALLY, INTO A SET OF COMPONENTS THAT INTERACT LOCALLY THROUGH FLOWS OF ENERGY AND RESOURCES. BOTH INTERNAL DYNAMICS AND EXTERNAL FORCING DRIVE CHANGES IN HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND MICROHABITAT PATTERN, AND THESE AUTOGENIC AND ALLOGENIC CHANGES IN PEATLAND STRUCTURE AFFECT HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES, WHICH, IN TURN, CONSTRAIN PEATLAND DEVELOPMENT AND CARBON CYCLING.

DOMINANCE WAS DISTRIBUTED AMONG LYCOPSIDS, FERNS, SPHENOPSIDS, PTERIDOSPERMS AND CORDAITES, AND EACH OF THESE GROUPS HAD DISTINCTIVE AND DIFFERENT ECOLOGICAL PREFERENCES AND AMPLITUDES. PEAT-FORMING HABITATS WERE DOMINATED BY LYCOPSIDS THROUGHOUT THE WESTPHALIAN, WITH A SIGNIFICANT CORDAITEAN ELEMENT IN THE MIDDLE WESTPHALIAN; DURING THE STEPHANIAN TREE FERNS WERE DOMINANT, FOLLOWING MAJOR EXTINCTIONS NEAR THE WESTPHALIAN-STEPHANIAN TRANSITION. EACH OF THE MAJOR PLANT GROUPS HAD DISTINCTIVE ARCHITECTURES AND TISSUE COMPOSITION. TREES CONTRIBUTED UP TO 95% OF THE PEAT BIOMASS AND TREE FORMS OF LYCOPSIDS, PSARONIUS AND MEDULLOSA LACK GOOD MODERN ANALOGUES. THE CORDAITES WERE THE ONLY WOODY PLANT GROUP TO CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO PEAT, AND THEN ONLY DURING THE MID-WESTPHALIAN. STRUCTURALLY WOOD-LIKE LYCOPSID BARK IS THE MAJOR ''WOODY'' TISSUE ENCOUNTERED IN MOST WESTPHALIAN COALS. TREE FERNS AND PTERIDOSPERMS WERE LARGELY PARENCHYMATOUS IN CONSTRUCTION; THE STIGMARIAN ROOT SYSTEMS OF LYCOPSIDS ALSO WERE LARGELY PARENCHYMATOUS. THE TISSUE STRUCTURE OF THESE DOMINANT PLANTS SUGGESTS THE NEED FOR EXTREME CAUTION IN THE INFERENCE OF MIRE ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS OR VEGETATIONAL STRUCTURE FROM COAL PETROGRAPHIC DATA. PEAT FORMED UNDER ARBORESCENT FERNS OR PTERIDOSPERMS, OR PEAT REPEATEDLY EXPOSED TO DECAY AND REROOTING BY STIGMARIAN ROOT SYSTEMS OF LYCOPSIDS, WOULD HAVE A DISTINCTLY NON-WOODY SIGNATURE AND YET WOULD HAVE FORMED IN A FORESTED ENVIRONMENT. A SUMMARY IS PRESENTED OF THE AUTECOLOGY AND SYNECOLOGY OF MIRE PLANTS, EMPHAZING THE STRUCTURAL FRAMEWORK PROVIDED BY LYCOPSIDS DURING THE WESTPHALIAN. CERTAIN CONSTRAINTS IN THE LINKS BETWEEN PEAT BIOMASS AND MIOSPORE PALYNOLOGY ARE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF OVER-REPRESENTATION, UNDER-REPRESENTATION AND NON-REPRESENTATION. THE FORMULATION OF SMITH'S FOUR-PHASE HYDROSERAL MODEL IS DISCUSSED AND COMPARED WITH MORE RECENT DATA AVAILABLE FROM PLANT PALEOECOLOGY. THE CURRENT DEBATE OVER AN OMBROTROPHIC VS. RHEOTROPHIC ORIGIN OF LATE CARBONIFEROUS PEATS RELIES IN LARGE PART ON PALEOBOTANICAL DATA, ALMOST ENTIRELY PALYNOLOGICAL, IN COMBINATION WITH PETROGRAPHIC ANALYSES. ECOLOGICAL STUDIES OF MIOSPORES AND OF COAL-BALL AND COMPRESSION MACROFOSSILS, AND THE LINKAGE OF MIOSPORES TO SOURCE PLANTS, PERMIT THE RE-EVALUATION OF MIRE SUCCESSIONAL MODELS. EVIDENCE FOR TREE LYCOPSIDS, SPHENOPSIDS, PTERIDOSPERMS AND CORDAITES SUGGESTS GROWTH MAINLY IN RHEOTROPHIC MIRES. TREE FERNS ARE LIKELY CANDIDATES FOR GROWTH IN DOMED MIRES, ALTHOUGH EVIDENCE IS AMBIGUOUS AND SOME TREE FERNS CLEARLY GREW UNDER RHEOTROPHIC CONDITIONS. DENSOSPORES, PRODUCED BY AT LEAST SPORANGIOSTROBUS LYCOPSID SUBTREES, HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED DIAGNOSTIC OF OMBROTROPHIC CONDITIONS; ABUNDANT EVIDENCE REFUTES THIS SIMPLISTIC INTERPRETATION AND SUGGESTS BROAD ECOLOGICAL AMPLITUDES FOR DENSOSPORE PRODUCERS, INCLUDING GROWTH UNDER RHEOTROPHIC CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH PLANT FOSSILS ALONE CAN NOT RESOLVE MOST OF THE MAJOR DEBATES IN MODERN COAL GEOLOGY, PALEOBOTANY DOES CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ANCIENT MIRES. AN APPROACH COMBINING PALEOBOTANICAL DATA WITH PETROGRAPHY, SEDIMENTOLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY, ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS, IS MOST LIKELY TO PRODUCE A CLEAR PICTURE.","PALEOBOTANICAL AND PALEOECOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS ON MODELS OF PEAT FORMATION IN THE LATE CARBONIFEROUS OF EURAMERICA","PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY","REVIEW","JAN",1994,"10.1016/0031-0182(94)90004-3","GEOGRAPHY, PHYSICAL; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY; PALEONTOLOGY","WOS:A1994MZ75600003"

WHILE SEDIMENT DISSOLUTION CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE SR INVENTORY OF THE MINEROGENIC SECTION OF THE PEAT PROFILE, THERE IS NO MEASURABLE EFFECT OF THIS PROCESS ON THE PH BURDEN. ISOTOPIC ANALYSES (PB-204, PB-206, PB-207, PB-208) SHOW THAT EFFECTIVELY ALL OF THE PB IN THE PEAT PROFILE WAS SUPPLIED EXCLUSIVELY FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. TO SEPARATE NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC PB, SC WAS SELECTED OVER TI, Y, ZR, HF AND REE AS A CONSERVATIVE, REFERENCE ELEMENT WHICH IS SUPPLIED BY SOIL DUST AEROSOLS DERIVED FROM ROCK WEATHERING.

THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCE HAVE DOMINATED THE SUPPLY OF ATMOSPHERIC PB TO THE PEAT CORE CONTINUOUSLY SINCE 3000 C-14 YR BP. THE AEROSOLS SUPPLIED TO THE BOG CAN BE DIVIDED INTO 3 CLASSES: A) PRE-ANTHROPOGENIC (OLDER THAN 3000 C-14 YR BP WITH PB EF < 2 AND PB-206/PB-207 > 1.194); B) PRE-INDUSTRIAL (DATING FROM 3000-240 C-14 YR BP, WITH PB EF GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 2 BUT < 20 AND PB-206/PB-207 1.193-1.179); C) INDUSTRIAL (MORE RECENT THAN 240 C-14 YR BP, WITH PB EF > 20 AND PB-206/PB-207 < 1.179).

WE USE LITERATURE REVIEW, SYNTHESIS AND MODEL SIMULATIONS TO EXPLORE THE ROLE OF MOSSES IN ECOLOGICAL STABILITY AND RESILIENCE. MOSS COMMUNITY RESPONSES TO DISTURBANCE SHOWED ALL POSSIBLE RESPONSES (INCREASES, DECREASES, NO CHANGE) WITHIN MOST DISTURBANCE CATEGORIES. SIMULATIONS FROM TWO PROCESS-BASED MODELS SUGGEST THAT NORTHERN ECOSYSTEMS WOULD NEED TO EXPERIENCE EXTREME PERTURBATION BEFORE MOSSES WERE ELIMINATED. BUT SIMULATIONS WITH TWO OTHER MODELS SUGGEST THAT LOSS OF MOSS WILL REDUCE SOIL CARBON ACCUMULATION PRIMARILY BY INFLUENCING DECOMPOSITION RATES AND SOIL NITROGEN AVAILABILITY. IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT MOSSES NEED TO BE INCORPORATED INTO MODELS AS ONE OR MORE PLANT FUNCTIONAL TYPES, BUT MORE EMPIRICAL WORK IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE HOW TO BEST AGGREGATE SPECIES.

"HAJEK M, 2006, PERSPECT PLANT ECOL","HAJEK M;HORSAK M;HAJKOVA P;DITE D","MIRE TERMINOLOGY, SUBDIVISION AND GRADIENT STRUCTURE HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO AN INTENSE DEBATE INTENSIFIED IN THE LAST YEARS. THE CONCEPTION OF WHEELER AND PROCTOR (J. ECOL. 88, 187-203), WHICH DIVIDES MIRES INTO BOGS, HAVING PH < 5.5, AND FENS, HAVING PH > 5.5, BECOMES GENERALLY ACCEPTED DESPITE A CERTAIN CRITIQUE FROM THE SCANDINAVIAN PERSPECTIVE AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT FEW CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DEBATE HAVE COME FROM CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN EUROPE AND FROM OTHER THAN BOTANICAL DISCIPLINES. IN THIS PAPER, WE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE BOG-FEN BOUNDARY IS CLEARLY DETERMINABLE NOT BY PH, BUT BY A SET OF NUTRIENT-REQUIRING SPECIES THAT AVOID TRULY OMBROTROPHIC CONDITIONS IN CENTRAL EUROPE. WE THEREFORE DEFINED FENS AS GROUNDWATER-FED WETLANDS THAI HOST LOW PRODUCTIVE NUTRIENT-LIMITED VEGETATION DOMINATED BY CYPERACEAE AND BRYOPHYTES. THE FERTILITY GRADIENT WITHIN FENS, ANOTHER CONTROVERSIAL POINT IN THE ONGOING DEBATE, IS EASILY DISTINGUISHABLE USING BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL DATA, BUT IT APPEARS PRIMARILY WITHIN CALCIUM-RICHER FENS. WE SUGGEST DEFINING FEN GRASSLANDS BY THE HIGH ABUNDANCE OF NUTRIENT-REQUIRING GRASSES AND FORBS RATHER THAN PURELY BY FEN ORIGIN AND MANAGEMENT. CONCERNING PH/CALCIURN GRADIENT, THERE IS LARGE VARIATION IN PLANT, MOLLUSC, ALGAL, FUNGAL AND TESTACEAN ASSEMBLAGES WITHIN FENS WITH A PH > 5.5 IN CENTRAL EUROPE EVEN THOUGH SOME AUTHORS NAMED ALL MIRES HAVING SUCH PH '(RICH) FENS'. THIS CLEAR AND EXTENDED POOR-RICH (PH/CALCIURN) GRADIENT IN FLORISTICAL DATA IS INDEPENDENT OF THE FERTILITY GRADIENT. CONDUCTIVITY (APPROXIMATING WATER MINERAL RICHNESS) CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE PH IN EXPLAINING THE VEGETATION VARIATION. VEGETATION COMPOSITION ACCOUNTS FOR A LARGER AMOUNT OF THE VARIATION IN ALGAL, MOLLUSCAN. TESTACEAN AND FUNGAL ASSEMBLAGES THAN EVEN LONG-TERM MEASURED ENVIRONMENTAL DATA. THE CHEMICAL LIMIT OF THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY SPHAGNUM SPECIES, WEN THE CALCITOLERANT ONES, IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND EASILY RECOGNISED NATURAL BOUNDARY BETWEEN MAJOR FUNCTIONAL FEN TYPES, ALTHOUGH IT VARIES AMONG REGIONS AND HYDROLOGICAL SITUATIONS. WE THEREFORE BELIEVE THAT FEN CLASSIFICATION BASED EXCLUSIVELY ON FLORISTICAL DATA IS NECESSARY TO AVOID CIRCULAR ARGUMENTATION AND PROVIDES THE BEST BASIS FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF HABITATS. WE PROPOSE TO SUBDIVIDE FENS INTO FIVE STANDARD VEGETATION TYPES WITH DEFINED BOUNDARIES: POOR FENS (SPHAGNO RECURVI-CARICION CANESCENTIS), MODERATELY RICH FENS (CARICION FUSCAE), RICH FENS (SPHAGNO WARNSTORFII-TOMENTHYPNION), EXTREMELY RICH FENS AND CALCAREOUS FENS (BOTH CORRESPONDING TO CARICION DAVALLIANAE). CALCAREOUS FENS WERE NEGLECTED DURING THE ONGOING DEBATE DUE TO ITS RELATIVE SCARCITY IN SOME TRADITIONALLY EXPLORED REGIONS. ITS ECOLOGICAL BOUNDARY IS THE POINT AT WHICH CALCIUM CARBONATE STARTS TO PRECIPITATE. WHICH IS CONNECTED WITH MARKED CHANGE IN PLANT AND ANIMAL SPECIES COMPOSITION. THE ECOLOGICAL DIFFERENTIATION OF ALL PROPOSED FEN TYPES WAS TESTED USING A DATA SET FROM TWO DIFFERENT REGIONS (CARPATHIANS AND BULGARIA). BOTH CONDUCTIVITY AND PH DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN PAIRS OF VEGETATION TYPES. ALL PROPOSED FEN TYPES ALSO MARKEDLY DIFFER IN MOLLUSCAN ASSEMBLAGES. (C) 2006 RUBEL FOUNDATION, ETH ZURICH.

ON THE BASIS OF STUDIES OF LAKE SEDIMENTS, MODERN ATMOSPHERIC MERCURY DEPOSITION RATES ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE INCREASED BY A FACTOR OF 3-5 COMPARED TO BACKGROUND VALUES: I.E., FROM ABOUT 3-3.5 MU G HG M(-2) YR(-1) TO 10-20 MU G HG M-2 YR(-1).

THESE VALUES ARE CLOSER TO THE ESTIMATES OF PAST DEPOSITION DETERMINED FROM LAKE SEDIMENTS, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT MODERN MERCURY ACCUMULATION RATES DERIVED FROM PEAT BOGS TEND TO OVERESTIMATE DEPOSITION. WE SUGGEST THAT SMEARING OF PB-210 IN THE UPPERMOST PEAT SECTIONS CONTRIBUTES TO AN UNDERESTIMATION OF PEAT AGES, WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON FOR THE OVERESTIMATION OF MERCURY ACCUMULATION RATES IN MANY BOGS. THE LOWER BACKGROUND MERCURY ACCUMULATION RATES IN PEAT AS COMPARED TO LAKE SEDIMENTS WE BELIEVE IS THE RESULT OF NONQUANTITATIVE RETENTION AND LOSS OF MERCURY DURING PEAT DIAGENESIS. AS MANY PROCESSES CONTROLLING TIME-RESOLVED MERCURY ACCUMULATION IN MIRES ARE STILL POORLY UNDERSTOOD, LAKE SEDIMENTS APPEAR TO BE THE MORE RELIABLE ARCHIVE FOR ESTIMATING HISTORICAL MERCURY ACCUMULATION RATES.","MODELING THE PAST ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION OF MERCURY USING NATURAL ARCHIVES","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY","REVIEW","JUL 15",2007,"10.1021/es0704232","ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000248363100009"

"MOORE PD, 2002, ENVIRON CONSERV","MOORE PD","THE TEMPERATE PEATLANDS ARE EXTENSIVE, COVERING AROUND 3.5 MILLION KM(2) OF LAND. THEY CONTAIN ABOUT 455 GT OF CARBON, ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO THE CARBON STORED IN ALL OF THE LIVING THINGS ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET, AND REPRESENTING AROUND 25% OF ALL THE SOIL CARBON ON EARTH. THESE BOGS ARE A SINK FOR ATMOSPHERIC CARBON AND THEIR CARBON UPTAKE ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 12% OF CURRENT HUMAN EMISSIONS. THEY VARY CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR FORM AND STRUCTURE AND ARE AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, INCLUDING THE STUDY OF PAST ENVIRONMENTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THEY ARE ALSO VALUABLE IN ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION. THEY ARE LOW IN BIODIVERSITY, BUT THEIR FAUNA AND FLORA ARE DISTINCTIVE AND MANY GROUPS ARE CONFINED TO THIS HABITAT. FOR ALL THESE REASONS, THE FUTURE CONSERVATION OF PEATLANDS IS A MATTER FOR CONCERN. THREATS TO PEATLANDS COME FROM DIRECT HUMAN EXPLOITATION IN THE FORM OF PEAT HARVESTING FOR ENERGY AND HORTICULTURE, AND DRAINAGE FOR FORESTRY. RISING ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS SHOULD CONTROL BOTH OF THESE PROCESSES IN THE WESTERN WORLD, BUT CONTINUED NORTHERN PEATLAND LOSSES ARE LIKELY LOCALLY, ESPECIALLY IN ASIA. PEATLAND DRAINAGE FOR FORESTRY OR AGRICULTURE WILL RESULT IN LOSSES OF CARBON TO THE ATMOSPHERE, ADDING TO THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT. HUMAN POPULATION PRESSURES, INDUSTRIALIZATION AND URBANIZATION ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE INFLUENCE IN THE BOREAL ZONE. FRAGMENTATION OF THE HABITAT IS NOT AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION BECAUSE BOGS ARE BY THEIR VERY NATURE 'ISLAND' HABITATS. ACIDIFICATION BY AERIAL POLLUTION MAY BE A LOCAL PROBLEM CLOSE TO SOURCES, BUT THE HABITAT IS NATURALLY ACID AND SHOULD NOT BE SEVERELY AFFECTED, THE INPUT OF AERIAL NUTRIENTS, HOWEVER, PARTICULARLY NITROGEN, COULD HAVE WIDESPREAD IMPACT ON BOGS, ENHANCING THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND ALTERING THEIR VEGETATION COMPOSITION. THE PHYSICAL REHABILITATION OF BOGS DAMAGED BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES PRESENTS MANY PROBLEMS, PARTICULARLY RELATING TO THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF PEAT STRUCTURE AND VEGETATION, BUT THE PROCESS CAN RESULT IN THE RE-FORMATION OF A CARBON SINK SO IT IS WORTH THE EFFORT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN ITS IMPACT ON BOGS. HIGHER TEMPERATURE (ESPECIALLY IF ACCOMPANIED BY RAISED ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS AND INCREASED NITRATE DEPOSITION) WILL ENHANCE PRODUCTIVITY, BUT WILL ALSO RESULT IN FASTER DECOMPOSITION RATES. THE OUTCOME OF THESE OPPOSING FACTORS FOR PEAT FORMATION WILL ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON THE FUTURE PATTERN OF PRECIPITATION. IF, AS SEEMS MOST LIKELY, SUMMER CONDITIONS BECOME WARMER AND DRIER IN CONTINENTAL REGIONS AND WINTERS BECOME MILDER AND WETTER, THE SUMMER DROUGHT COULD CAUSE PEAT LOSS AND BOG CONTRACTION. AN EXCESS OF DECOMPOSITION WILL LEAD TO BOGS BECOMING A CARBON SOURCE AND THUS A POSITIVE FEEDBACK IN GLOBAL WARMING. EMISSIONS OF METHANE AND NITROUS OXIDE WOULD ADD TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS PROBLEM, BUT LIKELY OXIDATION OF METHANE AND LOW N(2)O PRODUCTION MAY WELL MEAN THAT THIS IMPACT WILL NOT PROVE TO BE SIGNIFICANT. TREE INVASION OF BOGS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUMMER DROUGHT COULD LOCALLY LEAD TO INCREASED WATER LOSS THROUGH TRANSPIRATION, AND HIGHER HEAT ABSORPTION THROUGH ALBEDO CHANGE. THIS WILL ENHANCE THE DRYING EFFECT ON THE BOG SURFACE. OCEANIC MIRES WILL BE LESS SEVERELY AFFECTED IF THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN PRECIPITATION TAKES PLACE IN THESE REGIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT OVERALL FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE FUTURE OF THE NORTHERN BOGS IS LIKELY TO BE THE QUANTITY AND PATTERN (BOTH SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY) OF FUTURE PRECIPITATION IN THE ZONE.","THE FUTURE OF COOL TEMPERATE BOGS","ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION","REVIEW","MAR",2002,"10.1017/S0376892902000024","BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000175924000002"

THERE IS A NEED TO RECOGNISE THE RISK OF SOIL CARBON LOSSES OCCURING WHEN LAND USE CHANGE TO INCREASE CARBON STORAGE IS OFFSET BY COMPENSATORY LAND USE CONVERSIONS ELSEWHERE THAT RESULT IN NET CARBON RELEASE.

THESE SAMPLERS WERE FOUND TO BE WELL SUITED TO BOG POREWATERS AND ALLOWED VOLATILE (DISSOLVED CO2, ACETATE) AND REDOX-SENSITIVE SPECIES (HS-, FE2+) TO BE QUANTIFIED WITHOUT FURTHER SAMPLE PREPARATION OR TREATMENT. AQUEOUS SPECIES CONCENTRATIONS WERE DETERMINED IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS USING ION CHROMATOGRAPHY WITH EITHER CONDUCTIVITY (ACETATE, HCO3-, CL-, BR-, NO3-, HPO42-, SO42-, NA+, NH4+, K+, MG2+, CA2+), AMPEROMETRY (HS-), OR ABSORBANCE DETECTION (FE(III) AND FE(II)). THE COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSES OF ANIONS AND CATIONS ALLOWED HUMIC SUBSTANCES TO BE CALCULATED BY THE DIFFERENCE IN ELECTRICAL CHARGE BALANCE (I.E., THE ANION DEFICIT). CONCENTRATIONS OF TOTAL DISSOLVED CO2 (2-12 MM) SHOWED THAT CARBONATE EQUILIBRIA PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE ACID-BASE CHEMISTRY THROUGHOUT THE PROFILES. IN NEAR SURFACE, OMBROGENIC POREWATERS WITH PH AROUND 4, HOWEVER, PROTONS (APPROX. 160 MU EQ/L) ARE CONTRIBUTED MAINLY BY THE DISSOCIATION OF HUMIC SUBSTANCES (2-7 MM DOC).

AT EGR, S-T AND SO42- WERE COMPARABLE TO THE WATERS AT TGE, BUT HS- AT EGR WAS ALWAYS LESS THAN THE DETECTION LIMIT OF 0.15 MU M AT BOTH SITES DISSIMILATORY SULFATE REDUCTION IS LIMITED BY THE LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF SULFATE SUPPLIED TO THE BOG SURFACES (I.E., ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION ONLY), AND THE UPTAKE OF SULFATE AND ITS CONVERSION TO ORGANIC S COMPOUNDS BY THE LIVING PLANTS.

PREVIOUSLY THERE HAS BEEN SCATTERED AND ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOCUMENTING ORIBATID MITE DETRITIVORY IN PENNSYLVANIAN PLANT TISSUES. THIS STUDY EVALUATES THE INCIDENCE OF ORIBATID MITE DAMAGE FOR SEVEN MAJOR COAL-BALL DEPOSITS FROM THE ILLINOIS AND APPALACHIAN SEDIMENTARY BASINS, REPRESENTING A 17 MILLION YEAR INTERVAL FROM THE EURAMERICAN TROPICS. ALTHOUGH THIS INTERVAL CONTAINS THE BEST ANATOMICALLY PRESERVED PLANT TISSUES WITH ORIBATID MITE BORINGS IN THE FOSSIL RECORD, COEVAL ORIBATID MITE BODY-FOSSILS ARE ABSENT. BY CONTRAST, THE KNOWN BODY-FOSSIL RECORD OF ORIBATID MITES COMMENCES DURING THE MIDDLE DEVONIAN, BUT DOES NOT REAPPEAR UNTIL THE EARLY JURASSIC, AT WHICH TIME MITE TAXA ARE MODERN IN ASPECT. ALL MAJOR PLANT TAXA OCCURRING IN PENNSYLVANIAN COAL SWAMPS, INCLUDING LYCOPSIDS, SPHENOPSIDS, FERNS, SEED FERNS AND CORDAITES, WERE CONSUMED BY ORIBATID MITES. VIRTUALLY EVERY TYPE OF PLANT TISSUE WAS USED BY MITES, NOTABLY INDURATED TISSUES SUCH AS BARK, FIBROVASCULAR BUNDLES AND ESPECIALLY WOOD, AS WELL AS SOFTER SEED MEGAGAMETOPHYTIC AND PARENCHYMATIC TISSUES WITHIN.

OUR DATA INDICATE THAT ORIBATID MITES CONSUMED DEAD, AERIALLY-DERIVED PLANT TISSUES AT GROUND LEVEL, AS WELL AS ROOT-PENETRATED TISSUES SUBSTANTIALLY WITHIN THE PEAT. ORIBATID MITES WERE IMPORTANT ARTHROPOD DECOMPOSERS IN PENNSYLVANIAN COAL SWAMPS OF EURAMERICA.

LOCATION: EUROPEAN AND NORTH AMERICAN FENS. METHODS: THIS PAPER IS A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON THE EFFECTS OF GRAZING, FIRE AND CUTTING ON FENS, TO EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MANAGEMENT AND BIODIVERSITY IN FENS. RESULTS: A REDUCTION OF CATTLE GRAZING, MOWING AND BURNING IN FENS HAS LED TO A REDUCTION IN BIODIVERSITY IN FENS. THE VEGETATION OF ABANDONED FENS SHIFTS TO TREES AND SHRUBS AFTER 10-15 YEARS, WHICH SHADE THE SMALLER AND RARER SPECIES OF THESE WETLANDS. WHILE CAREFUL USE OF FIRE IS USED TO MANAGE FENS IN NORTH AMERICA, IT IS NOT WIDELY USED IN EUROPEAN FENS, PERHAPS BECAUSE THE PEAT OF DRAINED FENS MAY CATCH FIRE. CATTLE GRAZING CANNOT BE CONSIDERED A NATURAL DISTURBANCE IN NORTH AMERICA, SINCE CATTLE DID NOT EVOLVE ON THAT CONTINENT. IN EUROPE, CATTLE DO NOT GENERALLY GRAZE IN UNALTERED FENS, BUT THEY DO USE SLIGHTLY DRAINED FEN MEADOWS. CONCLUSIONS: THREE APPROACHES HAVE BEEN USED TO CONTROL THE DOMINANCE OF TALL WOODY AND HERBACEOUS SPECIES IN ABANDONED FENS, INCLUDING THE RE-INTRODUCTION OF CATTLE, MOWING, AND BURNING. OVERGRAZING RESULTS IN A PERMANENT REDUCTION IN BIODIVERSITY, THEREFORE CATTLE RE-INTRODUCTION MUST BE APPROACHED CAUTIOUSLY. IN EUROPE, BUT NOT IN NORTH AMERICA, MOWING HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT TOOL, AND MOWING HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN MAINTAINING SPECIES RICHNESS, PARTICULARLY IN FENS THAT HAVE BEEN MOWED ANNUALLY FOR CENTURIES. FIRE HAS BEEN THE MOST COMMON AND SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT TOOL IN NORTH AMERICA ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT EFFECTIVE IN REMOVING SHRUBS THAT HAVE BECOME LARGE. BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS ARE SIMILAR, THE LITERATURE OF BOTH EUROPEAN AND NORTH AMERICAN FEN MANAGEMENT CAN BE ANALYZED TO BETTER ASSESS THE MANAGEMENT OF FENS ON BOTH CONTINENTS.

IN THE FIRST 100 CM OF THIS PROFILE THERE ARE SEVERAL DISTINCT PEAKS IN ASH CONTENT, BUT THE VALUES ARE WELL WITHIN THE RANGE FOR TYPICAL OMBROTROPHIC SPHAGNUM BOGS. THERE IS ALSO CONSIDERABLE VARIATION IN THE CONCENTRATIONS OF MAJOR AND TRACE LITHOGENIC METALS (AL, TI, SC, CA, MG, RB, AND SR), BUT MOST OF THIS IS SIMPLY A REFLECTION OF THE NATURAL VARIATIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF MINERAL MATTER IN THE PEATS.

ARSENIC, CU; PB, SB, AND ZN ARE ALL MORE ABUNDANT IN SURFACE AND NEAR SURFACE PEAT LAYERS COMPARED TO DEEPER PARTS OF THE PROFILE. ENRICHMENT FACTORS (EFS) FOR THE PROFILE WERE CALCULATED CONSERVATIVELY BY NORMALIZING THE METAL/SC RATIOS OF INDIVIDUAL PEAT SAMPLES TO THE AVERAGE OF THE FIVE LOWEST METAL/SC RATIOS IN THIS PART OF THE CORE (69-84 CM); THESE ARE TENTATIVELY ASSUMED TO REPRESENT PRE-INDUSTRIAL BACKGROUND VALUES.

UNANSWERED QUESTIONS FROM THIS BODY OF WORK ARE: 1) HOW VARIABLE ARE CARBON FLUXES ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS?; 2) WHAT ARE THE BIOPHYSICAL FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY AND/OR TEMPORAL TRENDS IN CARBON FLUXES?; AND 3) HOW DOES THE BIOPHYSICAL CONTROL ON THIS CARBON FLUX VARIABILITY DIFFER BY CLIMATE AND ECOLOGICAL SPACES? TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS, WE SURVEYED PUBLISHED DATA FROM 59 SITES THAT REPORTED ON FIVE OR MORE YEARS OF CONTINUOUS MEASUREMENTS, YIELDING 544 SITE-YEARS OF DATA. WE FOUND THAT THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF THE INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY IN NET ECOSYSTEM CARBON EXCHANGE (162 GC M(-2) Y(-1)) IS LARGE RELATIVE TO ITS POPULATION MEAN (-200 GC M(-2) Y(-1)). BROAD-LEAVED EVERGREEN FORESTS AND CROPS EXPERIENCED THE GREATEST ABSOLUTE VARIABILITY IN INTERANNUAL NET CARBON EXCHANGE (GREATER THAN 300 GC M(-2) Y(-1)) AND BOREAL EVERGREEN FORESTS AND MARITIME WETLANDS WERE AMONG THE LEAST VARIABLE (LESS THAN 40 GC M(-2) Y(-1)). A DISPROPORTIONATE FRACTION OF THE YEARLY VARIABILITY IN NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH BIOPHYSICAL FACTORS THAT MODULATED ECOSYSTEM PHOTOSYNTHESIS RATHER THAN ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION. YET, THERE WAS APPRECIABLE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT COVARIANCE BETWEEN ECOSYSTEM PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND RESPIRATION. CONSEQUENTLY, BIOPHYSICAL CONDITIONS THAT CONSPIRED TO INCREASE ECOSYSTEM PHOTOSYNTHESIS TO FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION, AND VICE VERSA; ON AVERAGE, THE YEAR TO YEAR CHANGE IN RESPIRATION WAS 40% AS LARGE AS THE YEAR TO YEAR CHANGE IN PHOTOSYNTHESIS. THE ANALYSIS ALSO IDENTIFIED SETS OF ECOSYSTEMS THAT ARE ON THE VERGE OF SWITCHING FROM BEING CARBON SINKS TO CARBON SOURCES. THESE INCLUDE SITES IN THE ARCTIC TUNDRA, THE EVERGREEN FORESTS IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST AND SOME GRASSLANDS, WHERE YEAR TO YEAR CHANGES IN RESPIRATION ARE OUTPACING THOSE IN PHOTOSYNTHESIS. WHILE A SELECT SET OF CLIMATIC AND ECOLOGICAL FACTORS (E.G. LIGHT, RAINFALL, TEMPERATURE, PHENOLOGY) PLAYED DIRECT AND INDIRECT ROLES ON THIS VARIABILITY, THEIR IMPACT DIFFERED CONDITIONALLY, AS WELL AS BY CLIMATE AND ECOLOGICAL SPACES. FOR EXAMPLE, RAINFALL HAD BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS. DEFICIENT RAINFALL CAUSED A PHYSIOLOGICAL DECLINE IN PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN TEMPERATE AND SEMI-ARID REGIONS. TOO MUCH RAIN, IN THE HUMID TROPICS, LIMITED PHOTOSYNTHESIS BY LIMITING LIGHT. IN PEATLANDS AND TUNDRA, EXCESS PRECIPITATION LIMITED ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION WHEN IT RAISED THE WATER TABLE TO THE SURFACE. FOR DECIDUOUS FORESTS, WARMER TEMPERATURES LENGTHENED THE GROWING SEASON, INCREASING PHOTOSYNTHESIS, BUT THIS EFFECT ALSO INCREASED SOIL RESPIRATION. FINALLY, STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO EVALUATE THE DETECTION LIMIT OF TRENDS; WE COMPUTED THE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS OF TRENDS IN MULTI-YEAR CARBON FLUXES THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED TO CONCLUDE WHETHER THE DIFFERENCES ARE TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO RANDOMNESS OR BIOPHYSICAL FORCINGS.

ALTERED VOLCANIC ASHES HAVE BEEN FOUND IN NUMEROUS COALS WITH RANK RANGING FROM LIGNITE THROUGH VARIOUS BITUMINOUS COALS TO ANTHRACITE, AS WELL AS IN ALL THE CONTINENTS WHERE COAL BEDS ARE PRESENT. THE MAIN PRIMARY MINERALS IN VOLCANIC ASH THAT SURVIVE POST-DEPOSITIONAL ALTERATION INCLUDE HIGH-TEMPERATURE QUARTZ, PLAGIOCLASE, SANIDINE, ZIRCON, APATITE, MONAZITE, MICAS, RUTILE, AND ANATASE. ALTERATION OF VOLCANIC GLASS AND LESS STABLE PRIMARY MINERALS MAY RESULT IN THE FORMATION OF KAOLINITE, SMECTITE, ILLITE, MIXED-LAYER I/S AND, IN SOME CASES, CHLORITE AND ZEOLITES. IN ADDITION TO MINERALOGICAL AND PETROGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, IDENTIFICATION OF THE PARENT MAGMA TYPE IS COMMONLY BASED ON RELATIVELY IMMOBILE ELEMENTS RATHER THAN THE TOTAL ALKALI-SILICA CONTENTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN AFFECTED BY POST-DEPOSITIONAL ALTERATION. FOUR TYPES OF VOLCANIC ASHES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN COAL AND COAL-BEARING SEQUENCES, NAMELY FELSIC, MAFIC, INTERMEDIATE, AND ALKALI. ALTERED MAFIC VOLCANIC ASHES ARE CHARACTERISTICALLY ENRICHED IN SC, V, CR, CO, AND NI; HAVE POSITIVE EU ANOMALIES; AND ARE OF A MEDIUM-REE ENRICHMENT TYPE. ALTERED ALKALI VOLCANIC ASHES ARE UNIQUE IN THEIR SIGNIFICANT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF RARE METALS SUCH AS NB, TA, ZR, HF, REE, AND GA, AND ARE CHARACTERIZED BY DISTINCT NEGATIVE EU ANOMALIES. COMPARED WITH ALTERED ALKALI VOLCANIC ASHES, FELSIC TONSTEINS HAVE RELATIVELY LOWER REE CONCENTRATIONS AND LESS PRONOUNCED NEGATIVE EU ANOMALIES, BUT A GREATER FRACTIONATION BETWEEN LIGHT AND HEAVY REES. THE COMPOSITIONAL VARIATION OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF ALTERED VOLCANIC ASHES IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE TECTONIC FRAMEWORK AND GEODYNAMIC CONTROLS. VOLCANIC ASHES IN COAL MAY SERVE AS CHRONOSTRATIGRAPHIC MARKERS TO IDENTIFY AND CORRELATE COAL SEAMS, AND CAN ALSO BE USED FOR RADIOMETRIC AGE DETERMINATION. THE ASHES MAY HAVE PROVIDED TERRIGENOUS MATERIALS THAT SERVED AS SUBSTRATES FOR PEAT DEVELOPMENT; AND MAY HAVE TERMINATED PEAT ACCUMULATION IF VOLCANIC ASH IN LARGE QUANTITIES FELL INTO THE PEAT SWAMP; THEY CAN ALSO BE USED TO INDICATE THE GEODYNAMIC PROCESSES OF COAL FORMATION; AND PERHAPS EXPLAIN MASS EXTINCTION EVENTS. ADMIXED VOLCANIC ASH MAY LOWER THE QUALITY OF THE COAL IF NOT REMOVED IN THE PREPARATION PLANT.

THIS UNFROZEN WATER IS AT THE SAME NEGATIVE CHEMICAL POTENTIAL AS THE ICE. WHILE BOTH THE HYDROSTATIC AND THE OSMOTIC COMPONENTS OF THE CHEMICAL POTENTIAL WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THIS NEGATIVE VALUE, WE ARGUE THAT THE OSMOTIC COMPONENT (OSMOTIC POTENTIAL) IS THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR. HENCE, THE SOIL MICROORGANISMS NEED TO BE AT LEAST HALOTOLERANT AND PSYCHROTOLERANT TO SURVIVE IN SEASONALLY FROZEN SOILS. THE LOW OSMOTIC POTENTIAL OF UNFROZEN SOIL WATER WILL LEAD TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF CELL WATER, UNLESS BALANCED BY ACCUMULATION OF COMPATIBLE SOLUTES. MANY MICROBES APPEAR TO SURVIVE THIS DEHYDRATION, SINCE MICROBIAL BIOMASS IN SOME SITUATIONS IS HIGH, AND RISING, IN WINTER. IN LATE WINTER HOWEVER, BEFORE THE SOIL TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE ZERO, THERE CAN BE A CONSIDERABLE DECLINE IN SOIL MICROBIAL BIOMASS DUE TO THE LOSS OF COMPATIBLE SOLUTES FROM VIABLE CELLS OR TO CELL RUPTURE. THIS DECLINE MAY BE CAUSED BY CHANGES IN THE PHYSICAL STATE OF THE SYSTEM, SPECIFICALLY BY SUDDEN FLUXES OF MELT WATER DOWN CHANNELS IN FROZEN SOIL, RAPIDLY RAISING THE CHEMICAL POTENTIAL. THE DEHYDRATED CELLS MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCOMMODATE A RAPID RISE IN OSMOTIC POTENTIAL SO THAT CELL MEMBRANES RUPTURE AND CELLS LYSE. THE EXHAUSTION OF SOLUBLE SUBSTRATES RELEASED FROM SENESCING PLANT AND MICROBIAL TISSUES IN AUTUMN AND WINTER MAY ALSO LIMIT MICROBIAL GROWTH, WHILE IN ADDITION THE RISING TEMPERATURES MAY TERMINATE A WINTER BLOOM OF PSYCHROPHILES.

THE CATIONIC AND SILICA FLUXES OF BOTH GRANITIC AND BASALTIC WATERSHEDS ARE COMPARABLE WITH THOSE OF OTHER BOREAL REGIONS HAVING SIMILAR RUNOFF, COMPOSITIONS, AND CLIMATE. THE CATIONIC FLUX OF THE RIVERS IS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE BASIC ROCK FRACTION OF THE WATERSHED, WHEREAS THE DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON FLUX INCREASES WITH THE INCREASING PEATLAND FRACTION.

PLANT MACROFOSSILS PRESERVED IN PACKRAT (NEOTOMA) MIDDEN SITES IN SEMI-ARID REGIONS HAVE YIELDED THE MOST INFORMATIVE DATA FOR THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE LASTEST GLACIAL TO THE PRESENT DAY. THE REMAINS CAN, WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, BE IDENTIFIED TO SPECIES LEVEL, THEY REPRESENT A LARGE (> 75%) PROPORTION OF THE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF VEGETATION WITHIN A RADIUS OF 30-50 M OF A SITE, AND THEY CAN BE DATED BY THE ACCELERATOR MASS-SPECTROMETRIC RADIOCARBON METHOD. MOST SITES HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE ARID SOUTHWEST OF THE UNITED STATES AND SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE RECENTLY TO UNDERSTANDING OF LONG-TERM CHANGES IN SPECIES COMPOSITION AND SHIFTS IN RANGE AND ELEVATIONAL LIMITS OF SPECIES. SIMILARLY, ANALYSIS OF MACROFOSSILS IN LAKE, MIRE AND RIVER SITES CAN DRAW ON THE TAXONOMIC PRECISION, SMALL SOURCE AREA AND POTENTIAL FOR PRECISE RADIOCARBON DATING OF SAMPLES, TO PROVIDE DETAILED RECONSTRUCTIONS OF THE LOCAL VEGETATION OF LACUSTRINE, MIRE AND FLUVIAL HABITATS. THE VAST LITERATURE REPORTING THESE INVESTIGATIONS DEALS WITH SITES CHIEFLY IN NORTHERN TEMPERATE REGIONS, BUT RECENT STUDIES FROM TROPICAL AND WARM-TEMPERATE REGIONS SHOW THE PROMISE OF THE APPROACH. THE USE OF ANALYSES OF MICROSCOPIC CHARCOAL PRESERVED IN SEDIMENTS HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE PAST FEW DECADES AS PART OF ATTEMPTS TO RECONSTRUCT FOREST FIRE HISTORY AND, WHEN COMBINED WITH OTHER ANALYSES (POLLEN, PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY), TO INVESTIGATE PAST COMMUNITY DYNAMICS. THE MAJOR LIMITATIONS OF THE METHOD ARE POOR CHRONOLOGICAL CONTROL IN MANY SEDIMENTS, UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT SOURCE AREA AND LIMITED TAXONOMIC PRECISION. ON THE OTHER HAND, MACROSCOPIC REMAINS OF CHARCOAL CAN USUALLY BE IDENTIFIED TO SPECIES LEVEL, CAN BE DATED ACCURATELY AND HAVE READILY DEFINED SOURCE AREAS.

METHODS: WE DEVELOPED A BOG ECOSYSTEM MODEL THAT INCLUDES VEGETATION, CARBON, NITROGEN AND WATER DYNAMICS. TWO GROUPS OF VASCULAR PLANT SPECIES AND THREE GROUPS OF SPHAGNUM SPECIES COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER FOR LIGHT AND NITROGEN. THE MODEL WAS TESTED BY COMPARING THE OUTCOME WITH LONG-TERM HISTORIC VEGETATION CHANGES IN PEAT CORES FROM DENMARK AND ENGLAND. A CLIMATE SCENARIO WAS USED TO ANALYSE THE FUTURE EFFECTS OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2, TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION. RESULTS: THE MAIN CHANGES IN THE SPECIES COMPOSITION SINCE 1766 WERE SIMULATED BY THE MODEL. SIMULATIONS FOR A FUTURE WARMER, AND SLIGHTLY WETTER, CLIMATE WITH DOUBLING CO2 CONCENTRATION SUGGEST THAT LITTLE WILL CHANGE IN SPECIES COMPOSITION, DUE TO THE CONTRASTING EFFECTS OF INCREASING TEMPERATURES ( FAVOURING VASCULAR PLANTS) AND CO2 ( FAVOURING SPHAGNUM). FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE SHOWED THAT SIMULATED CARBON SEQUESTRATION IS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO VASCULAR PLANT EXPANSION. MODEL RESULTS SHOW THAT INCREASING TEMPERATURES MAY STILL INCREASE CARBON ACCUMULATION AT COOL, LOW N DEPOSITION SITES, BUT DECREASE CARBON ACCUMULATION AT HIGH N DEPOSITION SITES. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, N-DEPOSITION AND ATMOSPHERIC CO2 ARE NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD, BUT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THESE COMPONENTS OF GLOBAL CHANGE EXIST. THESE INTERACTIONS ARE THE RESULT OF CHANGES IN VEGETATION COMPOSITION.

HERE WE PROVIDE A REALISTIC ASSESSMENT OF THE THEORY THAT THE BASAL REGIONS OF THE ICE SHEETS THAT FORMED OVER NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE DURING GLACIATIONS WERE HOST TO SIGNIFICANT POPULATIONS OF ANAEROBIC MICROORGANISMS, INCLUDING METHANOGENS, ABLE TO METABOLIZE ORGANIC CARBON SEQUESTERED DURING INTERGLACIALS AND OVERRIDDEN DURING QUATERNARY GLACIALS. IN DOING SO, WE REVIEW THE CURRENT EVIDENCE FOR SUBGLACIAL METHANE RELEASE DURING DEGLACIATION, ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF THE SUBGLACIAL RESERVOIR OF ORGANIC CARBON (SOC), AND ASSESS THE AMOUNT OF SOC AVAILABLE TO SUBGLACIAL MICROBES AND THE LIKELY PATHWAYS AND RATES OF CARBON TURNOVER. WE THEN DISCUSS THE FATE OF SUBGLACIAL METHANE AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ITS RELEASE ON ATMOSPHERIC METHANE CONCENTRATIONS. WE CALCULATE THAT THE SOC EQUATES TO 418-610 PG C AND INCLUDES CARBON FROM TERRESTRIAL SOILS/VEGETATION, PEATLANDS, LAKE, AND MARINE SEDIMENTS. THE SOC THAT IS POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE FOR MICROBIAL CONVERSION TO METHANE IS SMALLER THAN THIS ESTIMATE DUE TO (1) GLACIAL EROSION, (2) ACCUMULATION OF RECALCITRANT ORGANIC CARBON COMPOUNDS OVER TIME, (3) CONVERSION TO CARBON DIOXIDE BY AEROBIC/ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION, AND (4) INCOMPLETE CONVERSION OF LABILE ORGANIC MATTER TO METHANE. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE TOTAL SOC AVAILABLE FOR CONVERSION TO METHANE IS 63 PG C. OUR ESTIMATES OF METHANE PRODUCTION POTENTIALS SPAN A WIDE RANGE BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING SUBGLACIAL METABOLIC RATES. WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THERE IS A STRONG LIKELIHOOD THAT SUBGLACIAL MICROBES COULD CONVERT 63 PG OF SOC TO METHANE DURING A GLACIAL CYCLE. IF THIS WERE THE CASE, RELEASE OF THIS METHANE FROM THE ICE SHEET MARGINS DURING RETREAT WOULD NEED TO BE EPISODIC IN ORDER TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT ATMOSPHERIC METHANE CONCENTRATIONS.

THE ANALYSIS INCLUDES A TOTAL OF 87 STUDIES REPORTING MEASUREMENTS OF CH4 EMISSIONS TAKEN AT 186 SITES COVERING DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, PEATLAND TYPES, AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.

SOON AFTER ITS IMMIGRATION PINE BECAME DOMINANT AND PINE WOODLANDS LARGELY REPLACED THE BIRCH FORESTS. ONLY ON THE LOCALLY WETTER SUBSTRATES OF THE RIVER FLOODPLAIN DID BETULA STANDS PERSIST. GRADUALLY THE IMPORTANCE OF HERBACEOUS COMMUNITIES DECLINED AND THE PINE WOODLANDS LOST THEIR OPEN CHARACTER. DURING THE LATEGLACIAL TWO REGRESSIVE PHASES IN THE VEGETATION SUCCESSION ARE REFLECTED IN THE DATA WHICH ARE EQUATED WITH THE OLDER- AND YOUNGER DRYAS BIOZONES. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YOUNGER DRYAS, THE FOREST-LIMIT WAS LOWERED AND THE IMPORTANCE OF HERBACEOUS COMMUNITIES INCREASED. LATER, PINE WOODLANDS THINNED AND ERICALES BECAME PART OF THE VEGETATION, INDICATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE ACID, NUTRIENT-POOR SOILS. A SUBDIVISION OF THE YOUNGER DRYAS BIOZONE INTO A WETTER, COLDER FIRST PART AND A DRIER, WARMER SECOND PART IS SUGGESTED. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EARLY HOLOCENE, PINE WOODLANDS BECAME MORE CLOSED AND SOILS MORE STABILISED. THE TRANSITION BETWEEN THE YOUNGER DRYAS AND PREBOREAL BIOZONES IS INDICATED BY A LITHOLOGICAL CHANGE TO ORGANIC (-RICH) DEPOSITS. BETULA STANDS PERSISTED ON THE LOCALLY WETTER SUBSTRATES OF THE FLUVIAL PLAINS. AT THE END OF THE EARLY PREBOREAL, THERE WAS AN EXTENSION OF BETULA STANDS ON THE RIVER FLOODPLAINS.

PLANT FOSSIL REMAINS REPRESENT THE PRE-ERUPTION VEGETATION OF THE SWAMP, WHICH RESULTED FROM ACCUMULATION OF PEAT IN A HIGH-ASH, PLANAR (RHEOTROPHIC) MIRE SITUATED IN A NARROW PALAEOVALLEY CONTAINING AN ACTIVE FLUVIAL SYSTEM. A TUFF BED (THE BELKA) AT THE BASE OF THE VOLCANICLASTIC WHETSTONE HORIZON WAS EXPOSED IN TWO CONTIGUOUS EXCAVATIONS OVER AN AREA OF 50 M(2) IN THE RADNICE BASIN OF WESTERN BOHEMIA, CZECH REPUBLIC. TWENTY-SEVEN MORPHOTAXA WERE IDENTIFIED, REPRESENTING 20 WHOLE-PLANT SPECIES WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF GROWTH FORMS. THE CANOPY OF THE PEAT-FORMING COMMUNITY WAS DOMINATED BY CORDAITES BORASSIFOLIUS TREES TOGETHER WITH THE ARBORESCENT LYCOPSID ""LEPIDODENDRON"" (= PARALYCOPODITES), WHEREAS LEPIDOPHLOIOS CF. ACEROSUS WAS SUBDOMINANT. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE LATERALLY EXTENSIVE ""CROWNS"" OF THESE ARBORESCENT LYCOPSIDS; WOULD HAVE OVERLAPPED DURING THE FINAL PHASE OF THEIR LIFE CYCLES, BUT DIFFERENCES IN THE HEIGHT OF TREE SPECIES RESULTED IN A COMPLEX AND VERTICALLY VARIABLE CANOPY INTERRUPTED BY RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED GAPS. THE UNDERSTOREY WAS DOMINATED BY MEDULLOSAN PTERIDOSPERMS AND MARATTIALEAN TREE FERNS, WHEREAS ZYGOPTERID FERNS AND SPHENOPHYLLS; COMPRISED THE BULK OF THE GROUND COVER. IN COMPARISON WITH THE CANOPY, UNDERSTOREY AND GROUND COVER SPECIES WERE LESS ABUNDANT AND PATCHIER IN DISTRIBUTION, WITH ALMOST COMPLETE ABSENCE BENEATH THE DEEP SHADE OF C. BORASSIFOLIUS TREES. LIANAS THAT ENTWINED ARBORESCENT TREES WERE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE PEAT-FORMING FOREST. THREE LYGINOPTERID PTERIDOSPERM SPECIES ALONG WITH A SPHENOPHYLL HAD A LIANESCENT HABIT BASED ON THEIR CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH UPRIGHT OR PRONE LYCOPSID TRUNKS AND ""CANOPY"" BRANCHES. SPECIES RICHNESS IN THE SWAMP SUPERFICIALLY APPEARS LOW. HOWEVER, CONSIDERING THE SMALL AREA OF EXCAVATION, ALONG WITH THE HIGHER DIVERSITY KNOWN FROM THE SAME TUFF BED IN THE ADJACENT, FORMER OPENCAST OVCIN MINE, IT APPEARS THAT SPECIES RICHNESS IN THE FOREST WAS COMPARABLE TO SOME OF THE LESS DIVERSE WESTPHALIAN PEAT-FORMING SWAMPS IN THE U.S.A.

ALL SOILS PERFORM ALL FUNCTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY, BUT THE VARIATION IN THE CAPACITY OF SOILS TO SUPPLY THESE FUNCTIONS IS REVIEWED IN TERMS OF DEFINED LAND USE TYPES (ARABLE, BIO-ENERGY, BROADLEAF FOREST, CONIFEROUS FOREST, MANAGED GRASSLAND, OTHER GRASSLAND AND NATURA 2000) AND EXTENDED TO INCLUDE THE INFLUENCE OF SOIL DRAINAGE CHARACTERISTICS (WELL, MODERATELY/IMPERFECT, POOR AND PEAT). THIS LATTER CONSIDERATION IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN THE EUROPEAN ATLANTIC PEDO-CLIMATIC ZONE; THE SPATIAL SCALE OF THIS REVIEW. THIS REVIEW DEVELOPS A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK ON THE MULTI-FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY OF SOILS, TERMED FUNCTIONAL LAND MANAGEMENT, TO FACILITATE THE EFFECTIVE DESIGN AND ASSESSMENT OF AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES.

THE THIRTEEN POLLEN ASSEMBLAGES ZONES DEFINED REFLECT, IN PART, THE COMPLEX DEVELOPMENT OF THE SITE. PRIOR TO C. 8500 BP, WETLAND IN THE PANNEL VALLEY WAS LOCALIZED AROUND THE SITE. BETWEEN C. 8500 AND C. 6000 BP, IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN COASTAL CONFIGURATION, SUCH AREAS UNDER-WENT EXPANSION AND THE VALLEY FLOOR WAS OCCUPIED ALTERNATELY BY SEDGE FEN AND ALNUS CARR. A PERIOD OF STABILITY FOLLOWED, WITH ALNUS-DOMINATED COMMUNITIES PREVAILING FOR C. 2000 YR.

THE VEGETATIONAL HISTORY OF ADJACENT DRYLAND AREAS IS OBSCURED BY THE CHANGING LOCAL CONDITIONS AND NATURE OF THE DEPOSITS INVESTIGATED. THE PROBLEMS OF RECONSTRUCTING PAST VEGETATION FROM COASTAL PEATS ARE EXPLORED. AMONGST THESE ARE THE DETERMINATION OF THE POLLEN SOURCE AREA, ESTABLISHING AN ENVIRONMENT OF ORIGIN FOR MANY HERB TYPES, AND DISTINGUISHING THE PROCESSES CONTROLLING WETLAND VEGETATIONAL CHANGE. THE DISCUSSION FOCUSES ON THE ARRIVAL AND EXPANSION OF ARBOREAL TAXA IN THE EARLY FLANDRIAN AND HUMAN ACTIVITY.

THE CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PEAT TOGETHER WITH ITS ACCUMULATION AND DECAY PROCESSES HAVE BEEN ANALYSED. PEAT IS AN ACIDIC MIXTURE OF DEAD AND DECOMPOSED. MAINLY VEGETABLE, MATTER FORMED IN BOGGY AREAS; IT IS THE YOUNGEST AND LEAST ALTERED COMPONENT OF THE COMBUSTIBLE ROCKS AND IS CHARACTERISED BY THE LOWEST CONTENT OF FIXED CARBON AND THE HIGHEST CONTENT OF VOLATILE CONSTITUENTS. PEAT IS FORMED BY DEGENERATION PROCESSES UNDER EXCLUSION OF ATMOSPHERIC OXYGEN BY THE ACTION OF WATER; THE SPEED OF FORMATION DEPENDS UPON THE CLIMATIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. IN MOST PEATLANDS TWO LAYERS CAN BE CHARACTERISED: THE AEROBIC ACROTELM AND THE ANAEROBIC CATOTELM, THEIR RELATIVE IMPORTANCE BEING CONTROLLED MAINLY BY THE POSITION OF THE WATER TABLE. IN THE ACROTELM THE AEROBIC PROCESSES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOSS OF UP TO 90% OF THE ORIGINAL MASS, DEGENERATION IN THE ACIDIC AND ANAEROBIC CATOTELM IS STILL IMPERFECTLY CHARACTERISED EVEN THOUGH THE CATOTELM IS THE REAL SITE OF PEAT ACCUMULATION. MOST OF THE RECENT LITERATURE CONSIDERS PEAT AS COMPOSED OF EASILY DEGRADABLE COMPOUNDS, E.G. POLYSACCHARIDES. AND RECALCITRANT MATTER (LIGNIN AND COMPLEX AROMATICS). THE LONE-TERM DESTINY OF PEAT HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY CHARACTERISED: ALTHOUGH IN A LARGE MAJORITY OF CASES IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT PEAT DECOMPOSES COMPLETELY (EVEN THOUGH SLOWLY) PROVIDED THAT IT IS GIVEN A SUFFICIENTLY LONG RESIDENCE RIME IN THE CATOTELM, SOME CASES CAN STILL BE INTERPRETED AS EXAMPLES OF SIMPLE ACCUMULATION. THE RATES OF INFLUX OF OXYGEN AND HENCE THE DEGRADATION OF ORGANIC MATTER INTO BOTH SATURATED AND PARTIALLY SATURATED PEAT HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED. THE DEPLETION RATE IS ABOUT 4500 G M(-1) YEAR(-1) FOR PARTIALLY SATURATED PEAT. THE AVERAGE DEPLETION RATE OF THE PEAT FOR THIS CASE WILL THEN BE SUCH THAT IT WILL TAKE ON THE ORDER OF 5 TO 50 YEARS TO DEGRADE HALF OF THE ORGANICS IN A 10 CM PARTIALLY SATURATED LAYER. FOR THE WATER-SATURATED CASE THE DEPLETION RATE VARIES BETWEEN 8 AND 12 G M(-2) YEAR(-1), WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN IN THE PARTIALLY SATURATED REGION. THE MODELS USED TO ANALYSE THE FIELD AND LABORATORY DATA ON GENERATION, DIFFUSION AND EMISSION OF METHANE AND CARBON DIOXIDE INDICATE THAT LABORATORY DATA AND FIELD OBSERVATIONS AGREE REASONABLY WELL. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT PEAT-ACCUMULATING ECOSYSTEMS MAY BE VALUABLE NATURAL ANALOGUES FOR THE STUDY OF THE LONG-TERM DESTINY OF INDUSTRIAL AND MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTES. ACCURATE STUDIES OF ACTIVE MIRES TOGETHER WITH AN AD HOC REVIEW OF THE EXISTING LITERATURE GIVE VALUABLE INSIGHTS IN THIS PROBLEM.

THE STUDIES WERE CARRIED OUT IN THE HIGH-ARCTIC VALLEY OF ZACKENBERGDALEN IN NORTHEAST GREENLAND. VEGETATION TYPE DYNAMICS AND LAND SURFACE PHENOLOGY WERE STUDIED THROUGH THE USE OF HAND-HELD SENSORS OF REFLECTION OF VEGETATION, FROM WHICH THE FAR RED NORMALISED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX (NDVI-FR) CAN BE INFERRED. FURTHERMORE, SPECIES-SPECIFIC DYNAMICS WERE STUDIED THROUGH MEASURES OF TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF FLOWERING THROUGH A PERIOD OF 10 YEARS. TIME OF SNOWMELT AND TEMPERATURE WERE THE MAJOR CONTROLLING FACTORS FOR THE TIMING OF THE PHENOLOGY IN THE SIX VEGETATION TYPES: FELL-FIELD, DRYAS HEATH, CASSIOPE HEATH, SALIX HEATH, GRASSLAND, AND FEN. SNOWMELT HAD A LINEAR POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE TIMING OF THE MAXIMUM OF THE GROWING SEASON, WITH LATE SNOWMELT, CAUSING A LATER OCCURRENCE OF THE MAXIMUM. WHILE HIGHER SUMMED TEMPERATURES DURING THE GREEN-UP PERIOD (TIME FROM SNOWMELT TO MAXIMUM) ALSO WAS SHOWN TO BE POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE TIMING OF THE MAXIMUM, ENHANCED FLOWER PRODUCTION SEEMED TO CAUSE LOWER VEGETATIVE BIOMASS PRODUCTION AND HENCE A LATER MAXIMUM. THE SEASONAL VEGETATIVE PRODUCTION, EXPRESSED AS THE SEASONAL INTEGRATED NDVI-FR (SINDVI), HAD A LINEAR NEGATIVE RELATION WITH THE TEMPERATURES DURING THE PREVIOUS SUMMER. THIS WAS PROBABLY DUE TO HIGHER TEMPERATURES CAUSING MORE FLOWERS THE FOLLOWING YEAR, LEADING TO A LOWER NDVI-FR. A STRONG NEGATIVE TREND IN MAXIMUM NDVI-FR IS DOCUMENTED IN ALL SIX VEGETATION TYPES DURING THE YEARS FROM 1999 TO 2006 WITH A DECREASE OF 0.01 NDVI-FR PER YEAR. THE MAIN REASON COULD BE DRYING OF THE UPPER SOIL LAYERS DUE TO EARLIER SNOWMELT AND HIGHER EVAPOTRANSPIRATION DURING RECENT YEARS. SOME GENERAL TRENDS IN PHENOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS WERE RECOGNISED, ALTHOUGH RESPONSES VARIED AMONG SPECIES. THE TIME OF SNOW DISAPPEARANCE WAS THE MAIN DETERMINANT FOR ONSET OF FLOWERING. SHRUBS SEEMED TO BE SUPERIOR IN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF AN EARLY SNOWMELT WITH RESPECT TO INITIATION OF FLOWERING. IN ADDITION, MOST SPECIES DEVELOPED FLOWERS AND SEED CAPSULES FASTER WHEN TEMPERATURES INCREASED. MORE FLOWERS INCREASE THE CHANCE OF CROSS-POLLINATION AND HENCE, OFFER AN INCREASED POSSIBILITY FOR SEXUAL REPRODUCTION AND GENETIC EXCHANGE. MOST SPECIES INCREASED THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS IN YEARS FOLLOWING A WARM GROWING SEASON IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR, ALTHOUGH SOME SPECIES ALSO DEPENDED ON CLIMATIC CONDITIONS IN THE CURRENT YEAR PRIOR TO ONSET OF FLOWERING. EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATIONS OF GROWING SEASON LENGTH, TEMPERATURE AND INCOMING RADIATION IN PLOTS WITH THE DOMINANT DWARF SHRUB, WHITE ARCTIC BELL-HEATHER CASSIOPE TETRAGONA, CONFIRMED THAT THIS SPECIES SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED FLOWERING WHEN SUBJECTED TO SHADING OR REDUCED GROWING SEASON LENGTH.

A DOMINANCE OF NEAR-SURFACE TEMPERATURES CONTROLLING BOTH SPATIAL AND SEASONAL TRENDS IS SHOWN BASED ON DATA OBTAINED USING CLOSED CHAMBER AND EDDY-CORRELATION TECHNIQUES AS WELL AS IN MANIPULATED FIELD PLOTS AND IN CONTROLLED INCUBATION EXPERIMENTS. DESPITE VARIABLE TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITIES REPORTED, MOST DATA CAN BE FAIRLY WELL FITTED TO EXPONENTIAL TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT EQUATIONS. THE WATER CONTENT (AT WET SITES LINKED TO THE DEPTH TO THE WATER TABLE) IS A SECOND MAJOR FACTOR REGULATING SOIL RESPIRATION PROCESSES, BUT THE EFFECT IS QUITE DIFFERENT IN CONTRASTING VEGETATION TYPES. DRY HEATH SITES ARE SHOWN TO BE PERIODICALLY WATER LIMITED DURING THE GROWING SEASON AND RESPOND THEREFORE WITH HIGH RESPIRATION RATES WHEN WATERED. IN CONTRAST, WATER SATURATED CONDITIONS DURING MOST OF THE GROWING SEASON IN THE FEN AREAS HINDER THE AVAILABILITY OF OXYGEN, RESULTING IN BOTH CO2 AND CH4 PRODUCTION. THUS, WATER TABLE DRAWDOWN RESULTS IN DECREASING CH4 EFFLUXES BUT INCREASING CO2 EFFLUXES. ADDITIONAL CONTROLS ON GAS PRODUCTION ARE SHOWN TO BE RELATED TO THE AVAILABILITY OF SUBSTRATE AND PLANT PRODUCTIVITY. SUBSURFACE GAS PRODUCTION WILL PRODUCE PARTIAL AND TOTAL PRESSURE GRADIENT CAUSING GAS TRANSPORT, WHICH IN WELL-DRAINED SOILS IS MAINLY CONTROLLED BY DIFFUSION, WHEREAS GAS ADVECTION, BUBBLES AND TRANSPORT THROUGH ROOTS AND STEMS MAY BE IMPORTANT IN MORE SATURATED SOILS. BURSTS OF CO2 GAS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED DURING SPRING THAW AND CONFIRMED IN CONTROLLED SOIL THAWING EXPERIMENTS. FIELD OBSERVATIONS AS WELL AS EXPERIMENTAL WORK SUGGEST THAT SUCH BURSTS REPRESENT PARTLY ON-GOING SOIL RESPIRATION AND A PHYSICAL RELEASE OF GAS PRODUCED DURING THE WINTER. THE IMPORTANCE OF WINTER SOIL RESPIRATION IS EMPHASISED BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MICROBIAL RESPIRATION IN ZACKENBERG SAMPLES IS NOTED DOWN TO A LEAST -18 DEGREES C. HENCE, THE IMPORTANCE OF WINTER RESPIRATION AND BURST EVENTS IN RELATION TO SEASONAL AND FUTURE CLIMATE TRENDS REQUIRES MORE THAN JUST SUMMER MEASUREMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE AUTUMN PERIOD SEEMS IMPORTANT AS SNOWFALL PRIOR TO LOW AIR TEMPERATURE MAY INSULATE THE SOIL, KEEPING SOIL TEMPERATURES HIGH. THIS WILL EXTEND THE PERIOD OF HIGH SOIL RESPIRATION RATES AND THEREBY INCREASE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WINTER PERIOD FOR THE ANNUAL CARBON BALANCE. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTROLLING SUBSURFACE GAS PRODUCTION, WE CONCLUDE THAT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE LANDSCAPE WILL RESPOND QUITE DIFFERENTLY TO THE SAME CLIMATE CHANGES AS WELL AS THAT SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ARE LIKELY TO BE DIFFERENT FROM LONG-TERM EFFECTS.","HIGH-ARCTIC SOIL CO2 AND CH4 PRODUCTION CONTROLLED BY TEMPERATURE, WATER, FREEZING AND SNOW","ADVANCES IN ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH, VOL 40: HIGH-ARCTIC ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS IN A CHANGING CLIMATE","REVIEW",NA,2008,"10.1016/S0065-2504(07)00019-0","ECOLOGY","WOS:000256528000019"

THE AGE ASSESSMENT OF THE RECORD IS BASED ON HIGH RESOLUTION AMS C-14 WIGGLE-MATCH DATING (WMD). FOR THE FIRST TIME AN AMS C-14 WMD BASED CHRONOLOGY COVERING THE LATE GLACIAL/HOLOCENE TRANSITION AND EARLY PREBOREAL IS INTRODUCED FOR A SITE IN THE NETHERLANDS. THE KREEKRAK BOTANICAL RECORD REFLECTS THE END OF THE YOUNGER DRYAS TO EARLY BOREAL AND CAN BE WELL CORRELATED WITH POLLEN RECORDS FROM OTHER SITES IN THE NETHERLANDS AND BELGIUM. THE PALAEO-TOPOGRAPHY SHOWED THAT THE KREEKRAK DEPOSITS FORMED IN AN ABANDONED CHANNEL OF THE RIVER SCHELDE. AROUND CA. 11,490 CAL BP, AT THE END OF THE LATE GLACIAL/HOLOCENE TRANSITION, INFILLING OF THE LAKE STARTED WITH PREDOMINANTLY ORGANIC DEPOSITS IN SLOWLY RUNNING WATER. AS A RESULT OF THE WARMER CLIMATE THE AREA BECAME FORESTED WITH BIRCH AND POPLAR DURING THE FRIESLAND PHASE (CA. 11,490-11,365 CAL BP). BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTIVITY OF THE LAKE AND ITS SURROUNDINGS INCREASED. AQUATIC VEGETATION DEVELOPED IN THE LAKE, WHILE SHRUBS OF WILLOW, REED SWAMPS AND GRASSLANDS FRINGED THE SHORES. PRECIPITATION INCREASED, WHICH CAUSED A RISE IN THE LAKE WATER TABLE AND AN INCREASE IN THE SUPPLY OF OXIC SURFACE (=RIVER) WATER INTO THE KREEKRAK TAKE. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE KREEKRAK LAKE WAS FED BY INFLOWING RIVER WATER, RUNOFF, PRECIPITATION AND SEEPAGE OF FE-RICH GROUNDWATER. AROUND CA. 11,43 5 CAL BP THE WATER BECAME STAGNANT PROBABLY AS RESULT OF A TOTAL CUT-OFF OF THE RIVER CHANNEL. INFLOW OF RIVER WATER CEASED, WHILE THE SUPPLY OF REDUCED FE-RICH GROUNDWATER BECAME DOMINANT. DURING THE RAMMELBEEK PHASE (CA. 11,365-11,250 CAL BP), THE CLIMATE WAS MORE CONTINENTAL AND THE ABUNDANCE OF GRASSLANDS AND OPEN HERBACEOUS VEGETATION INCREASED. BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTIVITY REMAINED HIGH. IN THE LAKE, THE SUPPLY OF FE-RICH GROUNDWATER CONTINUED, THE WATER LEVEL SLIGHTLY DECREASED BUT AQUATIC VEGETATION REMAINED PRESENT. AT THE END OF THE RAMMELBEEK PHASE A SUDDEN REDUCTION IN THE SUPPLY OF FE-RICH REDUCED GROUNDWATER CAUSED A LOWERING OF THE GROUNDWATER LEVEL IN THE AREA, RESULTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HIATUS. DUE TO THIS HIATUS, THE LATE PREBOREAL (11,250-10,710 CAL BP) IS ABSENT FROM THE RECORD. DURING THE EARLY BOREAL (10,710-10,000 CAL BP) THE LANDSCAPE BECAME DENSELY FORESTED AND ACCUMULATION OF PEAT IN THE FORMER LAKE RESUMED DUE TO A SLOWLY RISING GROUNDWATER LEVEL. THE BOREAL WAS A RELATIVELY STABLE PERIOD WITH LOW SEDIMENTATION RATES. THE COMBINATION OF PALAEOBOTANICAL AND GEOCHEMICAL ANALYSES IN THE KREEKRAK RECORD SHOWS A CLOSE INTERRELATION BETWEEN LANDSCAPE DEVELOPMENT AND GEOCHEMISTRY. IT APPEARS THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT OF THIS AREA DURING THE LATE GLACIAL/ HOLOCENE TRANSITION AND EARLY HOLOCENE WAS LARGELY INFLUENCED (DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY) BY MAJOR CLIMATIC CHANGES THAT OCCURRED DURING THIS PERIOD, WHICH DETERMINED LOCAL PHENOMENA SUCH AS THE COMPOSITION AND DENSITY OF THE VEGETATION, OCCURRENCE OF SEEPAGE AND RIVER ACTIVITY.

THE LOWERED WT SITE HAD GREATER PEAT AERATION AND LARGER SEASONAL VERTICAL WT FLUCTUATIONS THAT LIKELY ELEVATED PEAT DECOMPOSITION AND SUBSIDENCE WITH SUBSEQUENT INCREASES IN BULK DENSITY, VERTICAL HYDRAULIC GRADIENT, DECREASED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY (K-SAT), AND A GREATER PORE WATER RESIDENCE TIME RELATIVE TO THE UNALTERED SITE. THE RAISED WT SITE DISPLAYED A DECREASED K-SAT COMBINED WITH SEASONAL UPWELLING EVENTS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO A LONGER RESIDENCE TIME IN COMPARISON TO THE UNALTERED SITE. THESE DIFFERENCES ARE POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTING TO ELEVATED DOC CONCENTRATIONS AT THE LOWERED AND RAISED WT SITE RELATIVE TO THE UNALTERED SITE.

CRETACEOUS AND PALEOCENE VEGETATION ARE SIMILAR, WITH TAXODIACEOUS FLORA BEING IMPORTANT IN MIRE VEGETATION. FROM THE EOCENE ONWARDS, HOWEVER, ANGIOSPERMS WERE INCREASINGLY DOMINANT IN MIRE COMMUNITIES AND IN THE MIOCENE HERBACEOUS VEGETATION BEGAN TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE. TOGETHER WITH THESE CHANGES IN FLORAL CHARACTER AT LEAST THREE ASPECTS OF COAL CHARACTER ALSO APPEAR TO VARY SEQUENTIALLY WITH LIME AND ARE DISTINCTIVE IN THE TERTIARY: (1) PROPORTIONS AND THICKNESS OF VITRAIN BANDING, (2) COAL BED THICKNESS AND (3) PROPORTIONS OF CARBONISED MATERIAL, A COMPILATION HAS BEEN MADE OF DATA FROM THE COAL LITERATURE COMPARING OLDER COALS WITH THOSE OF THE TERTIARY, IN ORDER TO GIVE A PERSPECTIVE IN WHICH TO EXAMINE TERTIARY COALS. IT WAS FOUND THAT ONLY TERTIARY COALS CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT PROPORTIONS OF COAL DEVOID OF VITRAIN BANDS. IN ADDITION, TERTIARY COALS ARE THE THICKEST RECORDED COAL BEDS AND GENERALLY CONTAIN LOW PERCENTAGES OF CARBONISED MATERIAL (MANY LESS THAN 5%) AS COMPARED TO OLDER COALS. IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT PALEOCENE COAL BEDS ARE SIMILAR TO CRETACEOUS COALS IN THAT THEY TEND TO BE THINNER AND CONTAIN HIGHER PROPORTIONS OF CARBONISED MATERIAL THAN DO YOUNGER TERTIARY COALS. THE ABSENCE OF VITRAIN BANDS IN SOME TERTIARY COAL BEDS IS THOUGHT TO RESULT FROM THE FLORAS DOMINATED BY ANGIOSPERMS, WHICH ARE RELATIVELY EASILY DEGRADED AS COMPARED TO GYMNOSPERMS, THE THICKNESS OF TERTIARY COALS MAY BE RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN BIOMASS PRODUCTION FROM THE CARBONIFEROUS THROUGH TO THE TERTIARY, AS PLANTS MADE LESS INVESTMENT IN PRODUCING LIGNIN, AN ENERGY-INTENSIVE PROCESS, IN ADDITION, WITH LESS LIGNIN IN PLANTS, EASIER DEGRADATION OF BIOMASS MAY HAVE FACILITATED NUTRIENT RECYCLING WHICH, IN TURN, LED TO GREATER BIOMASS PRODUCTION. INCREASED BIOMASS PRODUCTION MAY HAVE ALSO 'DILUTED' THE CARBONISED MATERIAL PRESENT IN SOME TERTIARY PEARS, LEADING TO LOWER PROPORTIONS IN THE COAL. ANOTHER POSSIBLE CAUSE OF DECREASED CARBONISED COMPONENTS IN TERTIARY COAL IS THAT DECREASING LIGNIN CONTENT RESULTED IN DECREASED CHARRING DURING FIRES, AS LIGNIN IS PARTICULARLY PRONE TO CHARRING. A THIRD POSSIBILITY IS THAT THE CARBONISED COMPONENT OF PEAT MAY BE CONCENTRATED DURING COALIFICATION SO THAT TERTIARY COALS, GENERALLY OF LOWER RANK THAN MESOZOIC OR PALEOZOIC COALS, CONTAIN A SMALLER FRACTION OF CARBONISED PLANT MATERIAL. IT IS NOT AT PRESENT CLEAR WHICH OF THESE MECHANISMS MAY HAVE AFFECTED CARBONISED MATERIAL IN PEAT AND COAL BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT LIGNIN TYPE AND CONTENT HAS HAD AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN DETERMINING PEAT AND COAL CHARACTER SINCE THE PALEOZOIC.","DELINEATION OF THE DISTINCTIVE NATURE OF TERTIARY COAL BEDS","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY","REVIEW","NOV",1995,"10.1016/0166-5162(95)00014-3","ENERGY & FUELS; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:A1995TM70300002"

BIOCHAR PRODUCED THROUGH DIFFERENT PRODUCTION CONDITIONS AND FEEDSTOCKS AFFECT ITS PROPERTIES AND HOW IT PERFORMS WHEN INCORPORATED IN CONTAINER SUBSTRATES. BIOCHAR INCORPORATION AFFECTS THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF CONTAINER SUBSTRATES, INCLUDING BULK DENSITY, TOTAL POROSITY, CONTAINER CAPACITY, NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY, PH, ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY AND CATION EXCHANGE CAPACITY. BIOCHAR COULD ALSO AFFECT MICROBIAL ACTIVITIES. THE EFFECTS OF BIOCHAR INCORPORATION ON PLANT GROWTH IN CONTAINER SUBSTRATES DEPEND ON BIOCHAR PROPERTIES, PLANT TYPE, PERCENTAGE OF BIOCHAR APPLIED AND OTHER CONTAINER SUBSTRATES COMPONENTS MIXED WITH BIOCHAR. A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON THE IMPACT OF BIOCHAR ON CONTAINER-GROWN PLANTS WITHOUT OTHER FACTORS (SUCH AS IRRIGATION OR FERTILIZATION RATES) INDICATED THAT 77.3% OF THE STUDIES FOUND THAT CERTAIN PERCENTAGES OF BIOCHAR ADDITION IN CONTAINER SUBSTRATES PROMOTED PLANT GROWTH, AND 50% OF THE STUDIES REVEALED THAT PLANT GROWTH DECREASED DUE TO CERTAIN PERCENTAGES OF BIOCHAR INCORPORATION.

THE GHG ACCOUNTING SHOULD CONSIDER THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE OF THE PEATLAND AND THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC BENEFITS PEATLANDS PROVIDE LOCALLY. CULTIVATING ENERGY CROPS IS A VIABLE OPTION ESPECIALLY FOR WET PEAT SOILS WITH POOR DRAINAGE, BUT HARVESTING REMAINS A CHALLENGE DUE TO TRACTABILITY OF WET SOILS. PALUDICULTURE IN LOWLAND FLOODPLAINS CAN BE A TOOL TO MITIGATE REGIONAL FLOODING ALLOWING WATER TO BE STORED ON THESE LANDS WITHOUT MUCH HARM TO CROPS. THIS CAN ALSO INCREASE REGIONAL BIODIVERSITY PROVIDING IMPORTANT HABITATS FOR BIRDS AND MOISTURE TOLERANT PLANT SPECIES. HOWEVER, ON MANY PEATLANDS REWETTING IS NOT POSSIBLE DUE TO THEIR POSITION IN THE LANDSCAPE AND THE ASSOCIATED DIFFICULTY TO MAINTAIN A HIGH STABLE WATER TABLE. WHILE THE GOAL OF REWETTING OFTEN IS TO ENCOURAGE THE RETURN OF PEAT FORMING PLANTS AND THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THEY PROVIDE SUCH AS CARBON SEQUESTRATION, IT IS NOT WELL KNOWN IF THESE PLANTS WILL GROW ON PEAT SOILS THAT HAVE BEEN ALTERED BY THE PROCESS OF DRAINAGE AND MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER PEAT QUALITY AND HYDROLOGY WHEN CHOOSING MANAGEMENT OPTIONS. MAPPING OF SITES IS RECOMMENDED AS A MANAGEMENT TOOL TO GUIDE ACTIONS. THE ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THE SITES SHOULD BE ASSESSED BOTH FOR CONTINUED CULTIVATION BUT ALSO FOR OTHER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES SUCH AS RESTORATION AND HYDROLOGICAL FUNCTIONS (FLOOD CONTROL). FARMERS NEED ADVICE, TOOLS AND TRAINING TO FIND THE BEST AFTER-USE OPTION. BIOFUELS MIGHT PROVIDE A COST-EFFICIENT AFTER USE OPTION FOR SOME SITES. PEAT EXTRACTION FOLLOWED BY REWETTING MIGHT PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE OPTION AS REWETTING IS OFTEN EASIER IF THE PEAT IS REMOVED, STARTING THE PEAT ACCUMULATION FROM SCRATCH. ALSO THIS PROVIDES A WAY TO FINANCE THE AFTER-USE. AS IMPACTS OF LAND USE ARE UNCERTAIN, NEW POLICIES SHOULD CONSIDER MULTIPLE BENEFITS AND DECISIONS SHOULD BE BASED ON SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND FIELD SCALE OBSERVATIONS. THE NEED TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND THE KEY PROCESSES AND LONG TERM EFFECTS OF FIELD SCALE LAND USE MANIPULATIONS IS EVIDENT. THE RECOMMENDED ACTIONS FOR PEATLANDS SHOULD BE BASED ON LOCAL CONDITION AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC NEEDS TO OUTLINE INTERMEDIATE AND LONG TERM PLANS.

ALTHOUGH THE THREE NEWLY ACCEPTED SPECIES HAVE AT LEAST PARTIAL REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION, THEY HAVE NUMEROUS MORPHOLOGICAL AND ECOLOGICAL SIMILARITIES. SOME RECENT WORK STILL REFERS TO G. CONOPSEA S.L. BECAUSE OF DIFFICULTIES IN DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THE SPECIES, AND INERTIA IN ADOPTION OF THE NEW TAXONOMY. WHEREVER POSSIBLE, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN G. BOREALIS, G. CONOPSEA S.S. AND G. DENSIFLORA ARE HIGHLIGHTED. GYMNADENIA CONOPSEA S.L. IS A PERENNIAL, TERRESTRIAL ORCHID THAT IS WIDELY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS EURASIA. THE THREE SEGREGATE SPECIES ARE ALL CONSIDERED NATIVE. G. CONOPSEA S.S. (CHALK FRAGRANT ORCHID) OCCURS MAINLY IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF BRITAIN, WHERE IT IS MOST COMMONLY OBSERVED IN DRY CALCAREOUS GRASSLANDS AND PASTURES. G. DENSIFLORA (MARSH FRAGRANT ORCHID) OCCURS IN DAMP CALCAREOUS MARSHES, FENS AND DUNE SLACKS IN ENGLAND AND WALES; IT IS RARE IN SCOTLAND BUT FREQUENT IN IRELAND. G. BOREALIS (HEATH FRAGRANT ORCHID) IS MAINLY FOUND ON HILL PASTURES IN WALES, NORTHERN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND. THE THREE SPECIES ALL AVOID SHADE, BEING MOST ABUNDANT IN OPEN HABITATS. ALTHOUGH THE THREE SEGREGATE SPECIES CANNOT ALWAYS BE RELIABLY DISTINGUISHED ON THE BASIS OF MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS, DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES INCLUDE PLANT HEIGHT, LEAF WIDTH AND DISPOSITION, DENSITY OF FLOWERS IN THE INFLORESCENCE, SHAPE OF THE LABELLUM, SPUR WIDTH, AND ODOUR AND COLOUR OF THE FLOWERS. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL CYTOTYPES WITHIN G. CONOPSEA S.S. HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN CENTRAL EUROPE. THESE OFTEN GROW IN MIXED-PLOIDY POPULATIONS; IN CONTRAST, THE SPECIES APPEARS TO BE PREDOMINANTLY DIPLOID IN BRITAIN. GYMNADENIA CONOPSEA S.L. IS A NON-BULBOUS GEOPHYTE. LEAVES EMERGE IN SPRING, AND FLOWERING TAKES PLACE BETWEEN THE END OF JUNE AND THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST. VEGETATIVE ADULT DORMANCY THE FAILURE OF ABOVE-GROUND PARTS TO APPEAR IN A GROWING SEASON, FOLLOWED BY REAPPEARANCE OF FULL-SIZED PHOTOSYNTHETIC PLANTS IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS HAS BEEN OBSERVED. SUCH DORMANCY RARELY LASTS LONGER THAN 1 YEAR. THE FLOWERS OF G. CONOPSEA S.L. ARE ARRANGED IN A SPIKE. THE SPECIES IS SELF-COMPATIBLE BUT DEPENDENT ON POLLINATORS FOR SUCCESSFUL POLLINATION AND FRUIT SET. THE MOST FREQUENT POLLINATORS ARE DIURNAL AND NOCTURNAL LEPIDOPTERA.

"SMITH VR, 2008, POLAR REC","SMITH VR","THIS ARTICLE IS A SEQUEL TO A WORD-MODEL DESCRIPTION OF THE ECOSYSTEM OF SUB-ANTARCTIC MARION ISLAND, PUBLISHED IN THIS JOURNAL 30 YEARS AGO (SMITH 1977). IT EXPANDS ON THE QUALITATIVE CONSIDERATIONS OF PATTERNS OF ENERGY FLOW AND NUTRIENT CYCLING PRESENTED IN THAT PAPER, BY PROVIDING QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION FROM SUBSEQUENT RESEARCH AT THE ISLAND. PRIMARY PRODUCTION OF THE ISLAND'S LOWLAND PLANT COMMUNITIES IS HIGH ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, BECAUSE THE VEGETATION HAS A LONG GROWING SEASON DUE TO THE LACK OF SEVERELY COLD WINTERS OR DROUGHT. DAILY PRODUCTIVITY IS ACTUALLY LOW DUE TO LOW RADIATION LEVELS AND A COOL GROWING SEASON. THE VEGETATION IS PARTICULARLY EFFICIENT REGARDING ITS USE OF NUTRIENTS FOR ITS GROWTH, BUT STILL REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF NUTRIENTS TO SUPPORT THE HIGH ANNUAL PRODUCTION. SEABIRDS AND SEALS IMPORT LARGE QUANTITIES OF NUTRIENTS FROM THE OCEAN WHEN THEY BREED AND MOULT ON THE ISLAND. THEY MARKEDLY ENHANCE SOIL AND PLANT NUTRIENT STATUS IN THE AREAS IN WHICH THEY OCCUR, AND ALSO IN ADJACENT AREAS. HOWEVER, BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF THE ISLAND'S INLAND VEGETATION IS NOT DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY BIRDS OR SEALS AND MOST OF THE NUTRIENTS REQUIRED FOR PLANT GROWTH ARE PROVIDED BY DECOMPOSITION OF PLANT LITTER AND PEAT. SOIL INVERTEBRATES ARE CRUCIAL FACILITATORS OF DECOMPOSITION PROCESSES, WHICH ARE OTHERWISE RESTRICTED BY LOW SOIL TEMPERATURES AND HIGH SOIL MOISTURE CONTENTS. INTRODUCED HOUSE MICE HAVE INVADED ALMOST ALL PARTS OF THE ISLAND AND PREDATE HEAVILY ON THE INVERTEBRATES, THUS AFFECTING NUTRIENT MINERALISATION. THIS THREATENS NOT ONLY THE FUNCTIONING (LOWERED NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY LEADING TO SLOWER PLANT GROWTH AND THE PRODUCTION OF A LOWER QUALITY, MORE DECOMPOSITION-RECALCITRANT PLANT LITTER), BUT ALSO THE STRUCTURE (AN ALTERED BALANCE BETWEEN PRODUCTION AND DECOMPOSITION LEADS TO A CHANGE IN THE RELATION BETWEEN PEAT FORMATION AND DEGRADATION, WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF VEGETATION SUCCESSION) OF THE ISLAND'S ECOSYSTEM. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT MICE MAY ALSO AFFECT THE ISLAND'S ECOLOGY BY PREDATING ON SEABIRD CHICKS.","ENERGY FLOW AND NUTRIENT CYCLING IN THE MARION ISLAND TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEM: 30 YEARS ON","POLAR RECORD","REVIEW","JUL",2008,"10.1017/S0032247407007218","ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000257222300002"
"COLLINS PEF, 2006, PALAEOGEOGR PALAEOCL","COLLINS PEF;WORSLEY P;KEITH-LUCAS DM;FENWICK IM","MANY LOWLAND RIVERS ACROSS NORTHWEST EUROPE EXHIBIT BROADLY SIMILAR BEHAVIOURAL RESPONSES TO GLACIAL-INTERGLACIAL TRANSITIONS AND LANDSCAPE DEVELOPMENT. DIFFICULTIES EXIST IN ASSESSING THESE, LARGELY BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE FROM MANY RIVERS REMAINS LIMITED AND FRAGMENTARY. HERE WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RIVER KENNET, A TRIBUTARY OF THE THAMES, SINCE C. 13,000 CAL BP. SOME SIMILARITIES WITH OTHER RIVERS ARE PRESENT, SUGGESTING THAT REGIONAL CLIMATIC SHIFTS ARE IMPORTANT CONTROLS. THE KENNET DIFFERS FROM THE REGIONAL PATTERN IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. THE RATE OF RESPONSE TO SUDDEN CLIMATIC CHANGE, PARTICULARLY AT THE START OF THE HOLOCENE AND ALSO MID-HOLOCENE FOREST CLEARANCE, APPEARS VERY HIGH. THIS MAY REFLECT ABRUPT SHIFTS BETWEEN TWO CATCHMENT SCALE HYDROLOGICAL STATES ARISING FROM CONTEMPORARY CLIMATES, LAND USE CHANGE AND GEOLOGY. STADIAL HYDROLOGY IS DOMINATED BY NIVAL REGIMES, WITH LIMITED WINTER INFILTRATION AND HIGH SPRING AND SUMMER RUNOFF. UNDER AN INTERGLACIAL CLIMATE, INFILTRATION IS MORE SIGNIFICANT. THE PROBABLE ABSENCE OF PERMAFROST IN THE CATCHMENT MEANS THAT A LAG BETWEEN THE TWO STATES DUE TO ITS GRADUAL DECAY IS UNLIKELY. PALAEOECOLOGY, SUPPORTED BY RADIOCARBON DATES, SUGGESTS THAT, AT THE VERY START OF THE HOLOCENE, A DRAMATIC EPISODE OF FINE SEDIMENT DEPOSITION ACROSS MOST OF THE VALLEY FLOOR OCCURRED, LASTING 500-1000 YEARS. A PHASE OF PEAT ACCUMULATION FOLLOWED AS MINERAL SEDIMENT SUPPLY DECLINED. A FURTHER SHIFT LED TO TUFA DEPOSITION, INITIALLY IN SMALL POOLS, THEN ACROSS THE WHOLE FLOODPLAIN AREA, WITH THE RIVER FLOWING THROUGH CHANNELS CUT IN TUFA AND EXPERIENCING REPEATED AVULSION. MAJOR FLOODS, LEAVING LARGE GRAVEL BARS THAT STILL FORM POSITIVE RELIEF FEATURES ON THE FLOODPLAIN, FOLLOWED MID-HOLOCENE FLOODPLAIN STABILITY. PREHISTORIC DEFORESTATION IS LIKELY TO BE THE CAUSE OF THIS FLOODING, INDUCING A MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL SHIFT WITH SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SURFACE RUNOFF. SINCE THE BRONZE AGE, PREDOMINANTLY FINE SEDIMENTS WERE DEPOSITED ALONG THE VALLEY WITH APPARENTLY STABLE CHANNELS AND VERTICAL FLOODPLAIN ACCRETION ASSOCIATED WITH SOIL EROSION AND LESS CATASTROPHIC FLOODING. THE KENNET DEMONSTRATES THAT, WHILE A GENERAL PATTERN OF RIVER BEHAVIOUR OVER TIME, WITHIN A REGION, MAY BE IDENTIFIABLE, INDIVIDUAL RIVERS ARE LIKELY TO DIVERGE FROM THIS. CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTAND CATCHMENT CONTROLS, PARTICULARLY THE RELATIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE HYDROLOGY. (C) 2005 ELSEVIER B.V.

IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT SUBSTRATE AVAILABILITY FROM SOIL LABILE CARBON POOLS IS A MAIN DRIVER OF WINTER CO2 EMISSIONS. IN ECOSYSTEMS THAT ARE DOMINATED BY ANNUAL HERBACEOUS PLANTS, MUCH OF THE BIOMASS PRODUCED DURING THE SUMMER IS LIKELY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SOIL LABILE CARBON POOL THROUGH LITTER FALL AND ROOT SENESCENCE IN THE AUTUMN. THUS, THE SUMMER CARBON UPTAKE IN THE ECOSYSTEM MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE SUBSEQUENT WINTER CO2 EMISSIONS. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE CONDUCTED A PLOT-SCALE SHADING EXPERIMENT IN A BOREAL PEATLAND TO REDUCE THE GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION (GPP) DURING THE GROWING SEASON. AT THE GROWING SEASON PEAK, VASCULAR PLANT BIOMASS IN THE SHADED PLOTS WAS HALF THAT IN THE CONTROL PLOTS.

AS PART OF EARLY 19TH CENTURY INTENSIVE SURVEYS BY THE NEW ZEALAND COMPANY, GERMAN SCIENTIST JOHANN KARL ERNST DIEFFENBACH (1811-1855) SPENT THE WINTER MONTHS OF MAY-JULY 1840 STUDYING THE REMOTE EASTERN OUTPOST OF THE CHATHAM ISLANDS ARCHIPELAGO AT 43.7 DEGREES S AND 176.7 DEGREES W, RECORDING THE FIRST GEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS IN THIS PART OF THE SOUTHWEST PACIFIC AS PART OF THE LAND SURVEYS TO DETERMINE THE SUITABILITY OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND SETTLEMENT. DIEFFENBACH'S DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CHATHAMS SPARKED SOME INTEREST IN ENGLAND, BUT IT WOULD TAKE SOME 130 YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST GEOLOGIC MAP OF THE CHATHAMS WAS PUBLISHED IN 1970 AS A RESULT OF RESEARCH BY THE INSTITUTE OF GEOLOGICAL AND NUCLEAR SCIENCES (NEW ZEALAND). THE CHATHAMS, TODAY THE ONLY EMERGENT PARTS OF THE CHATHAM RISE EXTENDING EASTWARD FROM THE NEW ZEALAND MAINLAND FOR 1000 KM, HOST THE ONLY OUTCROPS OF THE RISE'S GEOLOGY, WITH DEEP ROOTS IN GONDWANA.

THROUGH PHASES OF COMPLEX UPLIFT AND ACCRETION ALONG THE GONDWANAN LANDMASS, A CONVERGENT MARGIN ENSUED WITH ASSOCIATED BACK-ARC VOLCANISM WITHIN ANTARCTICA FOR AT LEAST THE PERMIAN TO MID-JURASSIC TIME, WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY EVOLVED INTO A PASSIVE MARGIN, GIVING THE CHATHAM RISE ITS DISTINCTIVE FINGER-LIKE SHAPE. DIVERGENT PLATE MOTIONS, RESULTING FROM THE FINAL FRAGMENTATION OF GONDWANA, PULLED THE ZEALANDIA BLOCK AWAY FROM THE WEST ANTARCTIC MARGIN CA. 85-80 MA CONCURRENTLY WITH RIFTING PHASES THAT CREATED LARGE HORSTS AND GRABENS FORMING A BASIN AND RANGE STYLE LANDSCAPE.

THIS PHENOMENON HAS ATTRACTED MUCH PALAEOECOLOGICAL INTEREST AND SEVERAL HYPOTHESES HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS OFTEN SYNCHRONOUS AND RAPID REDUCTION IN PINE FROM MID-HOLOCENE WOODLAND. EXPLANATIONS FOR THE 'PINE DECLINE' INCLUDE PREHISTORIC HUMAN ACTIVITY, CLIMATIC CHANGE, IN PARTICULAR A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN PRECIPITATION RESULTING IN INCREASED MIRE WETNESS, AND AIRBORNE POLLUTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPOSITION OF TEPHRA. HITHERTO, ONE LARGELY UNTESTED HYPOTHESIS IS THAT MINERAL DEFICIENCY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PINE GROWTH AND REGENERATION ON MIRE SURFACES.

THESE PROCESSES ARE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THE COMPLEX PORE STRUCTURE OF PEAT SOILS. WE EXPLORE THE LITERATURE ON PEAT PORE STRUCTURE AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR HYDROLOGICAL, BIOGEOCHEMICAL, AND MICROBIAL PROCESSES IN PEAT, HIGHLIGHTING THE GAPS IN OUR CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND A PATH TO MOVE FORWARD. PEAT IS AN ELASTIC AND MULTI-POROUS STRUCTURED ORGANIC SOIL. SURFICIAL (NEAR-SURFACE) PEARS ARE TYPICALLY DOMINATED BY LARGE INTERCONNECTED MACROPORES THAT RAPIDLY TRANSMIT WATER AND SOLUTES WHEN SATURATED, BUT THESE LARGE PORES DRAIN RAPIDLY WITH A REDUCTION IN PORE-WATER PRESSURE, AND DISPROPORTIONALLY DECREASE THE BULK EFFECTIVE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY, THUS WATER FLUXES THAT DRIVE ECOHYDROLOGICAL FUNCTIONS. THE MORE ADVANCED STATE OF DECOMPOSITION OF OLDER (DEEPER) PEAT, WITH A GREATER ABUNDANCE OF SMALL PORES, RESTRICTS THE LOSS OF MOISTURE AT SIMILAR SOIL WATER PRESSURES AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER UNSATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITIES. AS EVAPORATION AND PRECIPITATION OCCUR, PEAT SOILS SHRINK AND SWELL, RESPECTIVELY, CHANGING THE HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY THAT MAINTAIN PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES AT THE PEAT SURFACE. DUE TO THE DISPROPORTIONATE CHANGE IN PORE STRUCTURE AND ASSOCIATED HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES WITH STATE OF DECOMPOSITION, TRANSPORT PROCESSES ARE LIMITED AT DEPTH, CREATING A ZONE OF ENHANCED TRANSPORT IN THE LESS DECOMPOSED PEAT NEAR THE SURFACE. AT THE MICRO-SCALE, RAPID EQUILIBRATION OF SOLUTES AND WATER OCCURS BETWEEN THE MOBILE AND IMMOBILE PORES DUE TO DIFFUSION, RESULTING IN PORE REGIONS WITH SIMILAR CHEMICAL CONCENTRATIONS THAT ARE NOT AFFECTED BY ADVECTIVE FLUXES. THESE IMMOBILE REGIONS MAY BE THE PRIMARY SITES FOR MICROBIAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES IN PEAT. MASS TRANSFER LIMITATIONS MAY THEREFORE LARGELY REGULATE BELOWGROUND MICROBIAL TURNOVER AND, HENCE, BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLING. FOR PEAT, THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE THEORY THAT LINKS THE HYDROLOGICAL, BIOLOGICAL, AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES WILL REQUIRE A CONCERTED INTERDISCIPLINARY EFFORT. TO THAT END, WE HAVE HIGHLIGHTED FOUR PRIMARY AREAS TO FOCUS OUR COLLECTIVE RESEARCH: 1) UNDERSTANDING THE COMBINED AND INTERRELATED EFFECTS OF PARENT MATERIAL, DECOMPOSITION, AND NUTRIENT STATUS ON PEAT PORE CONNECTIVITY, MACROPORE DEVELOPMENT AND COLLAPSE, AND SOLUTE TRANSPORT, 2) DETERMINING THE INFLUENCE OF CHANGING PORE STRUCTURE DUE TO FREEZE-THAW OR DEWATERING ON THE HYDROLOGY AND BIOGEOCHEMISTRY, 3) BETTER ELUCIDATING THE NON-EQUILIBRIUM TRANSPORT PROCESSES IN PEAT, AND 4) EXPLORING THE IMPLICATIONS OF PEAT'S PORE STRUCTURE ON MICROBIOLOGICAL AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES.","PORE-SCALE CONTROLS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND GEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES IN PEAT: IMPLICATIONS ON INTERACTING PROCESSES","EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS","REVIEW","AUG",2020,"10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103227","GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000556899700019"

PEAT PORE SURFACE WETTABILITY, WHICH IS DETERMINED BY PORE SURFACE CHEMISTRY, HAS STRONG HYSTERESIS AND SHOWS HYDROPHILIC AND HYDROPHOBIC BEHAVIORS DURING WATER DRAINAGE FROM AND WATER IMBIBITION INTO PORE SPACES. THIS LEADS TO HIGH RESIDUAL NAPL SATURATION IN PORE SPACES. SYSTEMATIC REDUCTION OF PORE RADIUS SIZE WITH DEPTH ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER PEAT DECOMPOSITION IN A TYPICAL PEAT PROFILE LEADS TO AN INCREASE IN NAPL-ENTRY CAPILLARY PRESSURE AND A REDUCTION IN PEAT PERMEABILITY WITH INCREASING DEPTH. THE FORMER LEADS TO STRONGER CAPILLARITY IN DEEPER PEAT HORIZONS, CAUSING RESISTANCE TO NAPL PERCOLATION COMPARED TO THAT IN SHALLOW ONES; ALONG WITH DECREASED PERMEABILITY WITH DEPTH, THIS RESULTS IN HIGHER NAPL MOBILITY IN SHALLOWER PEAT. THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT IS PREFERENTIAL HORIZONTAL MIGRATION OF NAPL IN SHALLOW LESS DECOMPOSED PEAT HORIZONS. OCCUPATION OF PEAT MACRO-PORES BY NAPL DRAMATICALLY DECREASES THE EFFECTIVE WATER PERMEABILITY AND LEADS TO LOWER RATES OF WATER INFILTRATION AND GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE IN THE CONTAMINATED AREA.

COAL IS A RESOURCE PRIMARILY USED FOR ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION, AND CURRENTLY SUPPLIES 41% OF GLOBAL ELECTRICITY NEEDS. SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF COAL ARE ALSO EMPLOYED IN METALLURGICAL PROCESSES, GASIFICATION, CEMENT INDUSTRIES. AND AS RAW MATERIALS FOR ACTIVATED CARBON AND MANY COMMON AND INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS, AS WELL AS FOR HEAT FOR THE WALLBOARD, ALUMINUM, AND CEMENT INDUSTRIES. A NUMBER OF COALS CAN ALSO BE CONSIDERED AS AN ECONOMIC SOURCE OF SOME CRITICAL METALS, AND THUS ARE COAL-HOSTED ORE DEPOSITS. THE CRITICAL METALS IN COAL AND COAL-BEARING SEQUENCES OCCUR AT CONCENTRATIONS COMPARABLE TO OR EVEN HIGHER THAN THOSE IN CONVENTIONAL ECONOMIC DEPOSITS. CHINA IS. AND IN THE COMING DECADES SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE, THE LARGEST PRODUCER AND USER OF COAL IN THE WORLD. THE HIGH VOLUME OF COAL USAGE IN CHINA HAS LED TO ATTENTION NOT ONLY ON THE TOXIC ELEMENTS THAT MAY BE RELEASED FROM COAL COMBUSTION BUT ALSO ON THE CRITICAL METALS THAT MAY OCCUR IN THE COAL AND COAL-BEARING SEQUENCES, AS WELL AS COAL COMBUSTION BY-PRODUCTS. CRITICAL ELEMENTS (E.G.. GE, GA, U. RARE EARTH ELEMENTS AND Y, NB, ZR, SE, V. RE, AU, AND AG, AS WELL AS THE BASE METAL AL) IN A NUMBER OF COALS (OR COAL ASHES) AND SOME COAL-BEARING STRATA IN CHINA OCCUR AT CONCENTRATIONS COMPARABLE TO OR EVEN HIGHER THAN THOSE IN CONVENTIONAL ECONOMIC DEPOSITS. THIS PAPER REVIEWED THE DISTRIBUTION AND ORE-FORMING MECHANISM OF SOME TYPICAL COAL-HOSTED ORE DEPOSITS IN CHINA, INCLUDING GE, GA-AL, RARE EARTH ELEMENTS (REE), AND NB-ZR-REE-GA. ADDITIONALLY, OTHER CRITICAL METALS SUCH AS BE. SC, LI, MG, V, AND RE IN COAL AND COAL BEARING SEQUENCES HAVE ALSO BEEN BRIEFLY REVIEWED. SEVERAL GEOLOGICAL FACTORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEPOSITION OF COAL-HOSTED CRITICAL METALS, INCLUDING INJECTION OF HYDROTHERMAL FLUIDS DURING PEAT ACCUMULATION OR LATER EPIGENETIC STAGES, DEPOSITION OF SYNGENETIC ALKALI VOLCANIC ASHES IN PEAT SWAMP, INPUT OF TERRIGENOUS MINERAL MATTER INTO THE COAL-FORMING ENVIRONMENT, LEACHING OF PARTINGS BY GROUNDWATER. AND MIXED PROCESSES INVOLVING BOTH HYDROTHERMAL SOLUTIONS AND VOLCANIC ASH. MIXED PROCESSES INVOLVING BOTH HYDROTHERMAL SOLUTIONS AND VOLCANIC ASH ARE ALSO IMPORTANT GEOLOGICAL FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEPOSITION OF COAL-HOSTED CRITICAL METALS. THE CRITICAL METALS IN CHINESE COAL AND COAL-BEARING SEQUENCES MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER THE ORGANIC MATTER OR MINERALS. FOR EXAMPLE, GERMANIUM EXCLUSIVELY OCCURS IN THE ORGANIC MATTER. GALLIUM MAINLY OCCURS IN BOEHMITE AND KAOLINITE, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, IN THE ORGANIC MATTER, RARE EARTH ELEMENTS AND Y OCCUR AS CARBONATE MINERALS (E.G., FLORENCITE AND PARISITE), PHOSPHATE MINERALS (E.G., RHABDOPHANE, SILICORHABDOPHANE, AND XENOTIME), AND IN PART ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ORGANIC MATTER. SOME CRITICAL METALS (E.G.. GE, AL, AND GA) HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY EXTRACTED AT AN INDUSTRIAL SCALE FROM CHINESE COALS, AND OTHERS HAVE SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FOR SUCH EXTRACTION. MAJOR CHALLENGES REMAINING FOR COAL SCIENTISTS INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMIC EXTRACTION METHODS FROM COAL ASH, AND THE CONTROL OF TOXIC ELEMENTS RELEASED DURING THE METAL EXTRACTION PROCESS TO PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH AND TO AVOID ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION.","RESOURCES OF CRITICAL METALS IN COAL-BEARING SEQUENCES IN CHINA: ENRICHMENT TYPES AND DISTRIBUTION","CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE","REVIEW",NA,2020,"10.1360/TB-2020-0112","MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES","WOS:000606331500007"

THIS VARIATION IN ELEVATION, CHARACTERIZED BY LOCAL HIGH (""HUMMOCKS"") AND LOW (""HOLLOWS"") PATCHES, IS MORE STRUCTURED THAN WHAT IS OBSERVED IN UPLANDS, AND IS INTERTWINED WITH CONCORDANTLY STRUCTURED SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN HYDROLOGIC REGIMES AND ASSOCIATED ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES. THE IMPORTANCE OF MICROTOPOGRAPHY IN WETLANDS IS MANIFOLD, WITH CRITICAL INFLUENCE ON LOCAL HYDROLOGICAL, BIOGEOCHEMICAL, AND BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES. FURTHER, THE CREATION AND MAINTENANCE OF WETLAND MICROTOPOGRAPHY IS A BALANCE BETWEEN ACTIVATION PROCESSES (I.E., THOSE THAT INDUCE RANDOM ELEVATION VARIATION) AND AUTOGENIC REINFORCEMENT PROCESSES (I.E., THOSE THAT PROVIDE THE FEEDBACKS NECESSARY FOR THE PERSISTENCE OF MICROTOPOGRAPHY). WHILE THERE ARE MANY MECHANISMS THAT CREATE VERTICAL STRUCTURE (E.G., TREE FALLS, ACCUMULATION OF ROOTS AND SOIL ORGANIC MATTER, AND SEDIMENT DEPOSITION), THEY ALL YIELD A SIMILAR CORE FEEDBACK TO ENHANCE AND SUSTAIN MICROTOPOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE. FINALLY, MICROTOPOGRAPHY CONTRIBUTES TO SPATIAL PATTERNING THAT CONFERS EMERGENT ECOSYSTEM-SCALE FUNCTIONS SUCH AS HYDROLOGIC STORAGE AND FLOWS, CARBON CYCLING, ORGANISM DISPERSAL, AND BIODIVERSITY.

THE PRESENT PAPER COLLATES AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON SCOTTISH SOIL C STOCKS AND C LOSSES AND REVIEWS THE POTENTIAL PRESSURES ON TERRESTRIAL C, WHICH MAY THREATEN FUTURE C STOCKS. PAST, PRESENT AND POSSIBLE FUTURE LAND USE, LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND LAND USE CHANGES (LUCS) INCLUDING FORESTRY, AGRICULTURE, NITROGEN (N) ADDITIONS, ELEVATED CO2 AND CLIMATE CHANGE FOR SCOTLAND ARE DISCUSSED AND EVALUATED IN RELATION TO THE ANTHROPOGENIC PRESSURES ON SOIL C. THE REVIEW DEDUCES THAT CURRENT AVAILABLE DATA SHOW LITTLE SUGGESTION OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN C STOCKS OF SCOTTISH SOILS, ALTHOUGH THIS MAY BE DUE TO A LACK OF LONG-TERM TREND DATA. HOWEVER, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THERE ARE MANY PRESSURES, SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE, INTENSITY OF LAND USE PRACTICES, SCALE OF LUC, SOIL EROSION AND POLLUTION, WHICH MAY POSE SIGNIFICANT THREATS TO THE FUTURE OF SCOTTISH SOIL C IF THESE FACTORS ARE NOT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN FUTURE LAND MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. IN PARTICULAR, THIS IS DUE TO THE LAND AREA COVERED BY VULNERABLE PEATS AND HIGHLY ORGANIC SOILS IN SCOTLAND COMPARED WITH OTHER AREAS IN THE UK. IT IS THEREFORE IMPERATIVE THAT SOIL C STOCKS FOR DIFFERENT LAND USE, MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND LUCS ARE MONITORED IN MORE DETAIL TO PROVIDE FURTHER INSIGHT INTO THE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN SEQUESTERED C AND SUBSEQUENT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, AS ADVISED BY THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE (UNFCCC).","ISSUES AND PRESSURES FACING THE FUTURE OF SOIL CARBON STOCKS WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON SCOTTISH SOILS","JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE","REVIEW","OCT",2014,"10.1017/S0021859613000300","AGRICULTURE, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000344016700001"

WE GATHERED 40 BASAL PEAT SAMPLES REPRESENTATIVE OF SOUTH AFRICA'S PEATLANDS TO EXPLORE THEIR DEVELOPMENT DURING THE LATE PLEISTOCENE AND HOLOCENE. DEPTH PROFILES OF NINE OF THEM WERE ALSO INVESTIGATED USING RADIOCARBON DATING, WHICH YIELDED INFORMATION ON PAST ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES AFFECTING SOUTH AFRICAN PEATLANDS. THE DATA SHOWED THREE PEAKS IN THE FREQUENCY OF PEATLAND INITIATION, WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH AVAILABLE CLIMATIC AND SEA LEVEL FLUCTUATION DATA: ONE AFTER THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM (LGM) AND TWO DURING THE MID TO LATE HOLOCENE. INLAND PEATLANDS IN MOUNTAIN VALLEYS SHOWED OPTIMAL GROWING CONDITIONS DURING THE GLACIAL-INTERGLACIAL TRANSITION, CONTINUING UNTIL THE EARLY-HOLOCENE. THIS IS DUE TO THE SWITCH TO THE WET AND WARM INTERGLACIAL CLIMATE. IN CONTRAST, COASTAL PEATLANDS SHOWED OPTIMAL INITIATION CONDITIONS OVER TWO PHASES DURING THE HOLOCENE, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH SEA LEVEL RISE PEAKS THAT LED TO OPTIMAL MOIST CONDITIONS OCCURRING CA. 6,000-3,000 AND 1,000 YEARS AGO. SEA LEVEL RISE REDUCED GROUNDWATER DRAINAGE, WHICH LED TO A RISE IN THE PRIMARY GROUNDWATER TABLE. HOWEVER, DATA FROM SOME OF THE COASTAL PEATLANDS INDICATE INDEPENDENCE FROM THE SEA LEVEL FLUCTUATION, AND THAT THEY ARE RATHER CONTROLLED BY CLIMATIC CONDITIONS AND THEIR LOCAL HYDROGEOMORPHIC SETTING, E.G. PERCHED GROUNDWATER AQUIFERS. SOME PEATLAND COMPLEXES SHOW A PATTERN OF PHASED INITIATION WITH PEAT INITIATION CONSISTENT WITH ALTITUDE DIFFERENCE, WHICH COULD BE DUE TO A POSITIVE FEEDBACK OF BLOCKING CAUSED BY PEAT ACCUMULATION IN LOWER REACHES, REDUCING GROUNDWATER DRAINAGE TO THE SEA.","SOUTH AFRICAN PEATLANDS: A REVIEW OF LATE PLEISTOCENE-HOLOCENE DEVELOPMENTS USING RADIOCARBON DATING","MIRES AND PEAT","REVIEW",NA,2019,"10.19189/MaP.2018.kHR.329","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000482659000001"

WHEN COMPARED WITH BOREAL PEATLANDS, OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUNCTIONING OF SSAP IS POOR, AND IT IS NECESSARY TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THEIR SCIENTIFIC AND ECOLOGICAL VALUE AND TO ENSURE THEIR CONSERVATION.

TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, WE REVIEWED A TOTAL OF 196 RESEARCH PAPERS/REPORTS FROM ACROSS THE PEER-REVIEWED AND GREY LITERATURE. WE CONCLUDE THAT GAPS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF SSAP HAVE DEEPLY UNDERMINED THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE CONSERVATION STRATEGIES FOR THESE UNDERSTUDIED ECOSYSTEMS.

THE FUNCTIONING OF NORTHERN BOREAL FOREST SPECIES AND THEIR CAPACITY TO ADAPT TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES APPEAR TO DEPEND ON SOIL CONDITIONS. CLIMATE WARMING IS EXPECTED TO HAVE PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED EFFECTS ON PALUDIFIED BOREAL ECOSYSTEMS AND CAN ALTER CURRENT FOREST SPECIES COMPOSITION AND ADAPTATION BY CHANGING SOIL CONDITIONS SUCH AS MOISTURE, TEMPERATURE REGIMES, AND SOIL RESPIRATION. IN THIS PAPER, WE REVIEW AND SYNTHESIZE RESULTS FROM VARIOUS REPORTED STUDIES (I.E., 88 RESEARCH ARTICLES CITED HEREAFTER) TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATIC WARMING ON SOIL CONDITIONS OF PALUDIFIED FORESTS IN NORTH AMERICA. PREDICTIONS THAT GLOBAL WARMING MAY INCREASE THE DECOMPOSITION RATE MUST BE CONSIDERED IN COMBINATION WITH ITS IMPACT ON SOIL MOISTURE, WHICH APPEARS TO BE A LIMITING FACTOR. LOCAL ADAPTATION OR ACCLIMATION TO CURRENT CLIMATIC CONDITIONS IS OCCURRING IN BOREAL FORESTS, WHICH IS LIKELY TO BE IMPORTANT FOR CONTINUED ECOSYSTEM STABILITY IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE MOST COMMONLY CITED RESPONSE OF BOREAL FOREST SPECIES TO GLOBAL WARMING IS A NORTHWARD MIGRATION THAT TRACKS THE CLIMATE AND SOIL CONDITIONS (E.G., TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE) TO WHICH THEY ARE ADAPTED. YET, SOME CONSTRAINTS MAY INFLUENCE THIS KIND OF ADAPTATION, SUCH AS WATER AVAILABILITY, CHANGES IN FIRE REGIMES, DECOMPOSER ADAPTATIONS, AND THE DYNAMIC OF PEAT ACCUMULATION. IN THIS PAPER, AS A STUDY CASE, WE EXAMINED AN EXAMPLE OF POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF CLIMATIC WARMING ON FUTURE PALUDIFICATION CHANGES IN THE EASTERN LOWLAND REGION OF CANADA THROUGH THREE DIFFERENT COMBINED HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOS BASED ON TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION (E.G., UNCHANGED, INCREASE, OR DECREASE). AN INCREASE SCENARIO IN PRECIPITATION WILL LIKELY FAVOR PEAT ACCUMULATION IN BOREAL FOREST STANDS PRONE TO PALUDIFICATION AND FACILITATE FORESTED PEATLAND EXPANSION INTO UPLAND FOREST, WHILE DECREASED OR UNCHANGED PRECIPITATION COMBINED WITH AN INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE WILL PROBABLY FAVOR SUCCESSION OF FORESTED PEATLANDS TO UPLAND BOREAL FORESTS. EACH OF THE THREE SCENARIOS WERE DISCUSSED IN THIS STUDY, AND CONSEQUENT SILVICULTURAL TREATMENT OPTIONS WERE SUGGESTED FOR EACH SCENARIO TO COPE WITH ANTICIPATED SOIL AND SPECIES CHANGES IN THE BOREAL FORESTS. WE CONCLUDED THAT, DESPITE THE FACT BOREAL SOILS WILL NOT CONSTRAIN ADAPTATION OF BOREAL FORESTS, SOME CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATIC WARMING MAY REDUCE THE ABILITY OF CERTAIN SPECIES TO RESPOND TO NATURAL DISTURBANCES SUCH AS PEST AND DISEASE OUTBREAKS, AND EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS.","ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF CLIMATE WARMING ON PALUDIFICATION PROCESSES: WILL SOIL CONDITIONS LIMIT THE ADAPTATION OF NORTHERN BOREAL FORESTS TO CLIMATE CHANGE?

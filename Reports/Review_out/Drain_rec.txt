HERE WE COMPARE THEIR POTENTIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS REGARDING NITROGEN AND LAND DEMAND. IN THE EVENT THAT NO FURTHER AREAS ARE EXPLOITED, DRAINED PEATLANDS WILL CUMULATIVELY RELEASE 80.8 GT CARBON AND 2.3 GT NITROGEN. THIS CORRESPONDS TO A CONTEMPORARY ANNUAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION OF 1.91 (0.31-3.38) GT CO2-EQ. THAT COULD BE SAVED WITH PEATLAND RESTORATION. SOIL CARBON SEQUESTRATION ON ALL AGRICULTURAL LAND HAS COMPARABLE MITIGATION POTENTIAL. HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL NITROGEN IS NEEDED TO BUILD UP A SIMILAR CARBON POOL IN ORGANIC MATTER OF MINERAL SOILS, EQUIVALENT TO 30-80% OF THE GLOBAL FERTILIZER NITROGEN APPLICATION ANNUALLY. RESTORING PEATLANDS IS 3.4 TIMES LESS NITROGEN COSTLY AND INVOLVES A MUCH SMALLER LAND AREA DEMAND THAN MINERAL SOIL CARBON SEQUESTRATION, CALLING FOR A STRONGER CONSIDERATION OF PEATLAND REHABILITATION AS A MITIGATION MEASURE.","THE UNDERAPPRECIATED POTENTIAL OF PEATLANDS IN GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION STRATEGIES","NATURE COMMUNICATIONS","ARTICLE","MAR 14",2018,"10.1038/s41467-018-03406-6","MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES","WOS:000427377100001"

TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF WARMING ON GHG DYNAMICS, WE DEPLOYED OPEN-TOP CHAMBERS IN A SUBARCTIC TUNDRA SITE IN NORTHEAST EUROPEAN RUSSIA. WE DETERMINED CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), METHANE (CH4), AND NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) FLUXES AS WELL AS THE CONCENTRATION OF THOSE GASES, INORGANIC NITROGEN (N) AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC) ALONG THE SOIL PROFILE. STUDIED TUNDRA SURFACES RANGED FROM MINERAL TO ORGANIC SOILS AND FROM VEGETATED TO UNVEGETATED AREAS. AS A RESULT OF AIR WARMING, THE SEASONAL GHG BUDGET OF THE VEGETATED TUNDRA SURFACES SHIFTED FROM A GHG SINK OF -300 TO -198 G CO2 -EQ M(-2) TO A SOURCE OF 105 TO 144 G CO2 -EQ M(-2). AT BARE PEAT SURFACES, WE OBSERVED INCREASED RELEASE OF ALL THREE GHGS. WHILE THE POSITIVE WARMING RESPONSE WAS DOMINATED BY CO2, WE PROVIDE HERE THE FIRST IN SITU EVIDENCE OF INCREASING N2O EMISSIONS FROM TUNDRA SOILS WITH WARMING. WARMING PROMOTED N2O RELEASE NOT ONLY FROM BARE PEAT, PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED AS A STRONG N2O SOURCE, BUT ALSO FROM THE ABUNDANT, VEGETATED PEAT SURFACES THAT DO NOT EMIT N2O UNDER PRESENT CLIMATE. AT THESE SURFACES, ELEVATED TEMPERATURES HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON PLANT GROWTH, RESULTING IN LOWER PLANT N UPTAKE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, BETTER N AVAILABILITY FOR SOIL MICROBES. ALTHOUGH THE WARMING WAS LIMITED TO THE SOIL SURFACE AND DID NOT ALTER THAW DEPTH, IT INCREASED CONCENTRATIONS OF DOC, CO2, AND CH4 IN THE SOIL DOWN TO THE PERMAFROST TABLE. THIS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO DOWNWARD DOC LEACHING, FUELING MICROBIAL ACTIVITY AT DEPTH. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR RESULTS EMPHASIZE THE TIGHT LINKAGES BETWEEN PLANT AND SOIL PROCESSES, AND DIFFERENT SOIL LAYERS, WHICH NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN PREDICTING THE CLIMATE CHANGE FEEDBACK OF THE ARCTIC.","WARMING OF SUBARCTIC TUNDRA INCREASES EMISSIONS OF ALL THREE IMPORTANT GREENHOUSE GASES - CARBON DIOXIDE, METHANE, AND NITROUS OXIDE","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","ARTICLE","AUG",2017,"10.1111/gcb.13563","BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000404863300015"

EMISSIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES WERE MEASURED WITH IDENTICAL METHODS. SITE-AVERAGED GHG BUDGETS WERE SURPRISINGLY VARIABLE (29.2 +/- 17.4 T CO2-EQ. HA(-1)YR(-1)) AND PARTIALLY HIGHER THAN ALL PUBLISHED DATA AND THE IPCC DEFAULT EMISSION FACTORS FOR GHG INVENTORIES. GENERALLY, CO2 (27.7 +/- 17.3 T CO(2)HA(-1)YR(-1)) DOMINATED THE GHG BUDGET. NITROUS OXIDE (2.3 +/- 2.4KG N2O-N HA(-1)YR(-1)) AND METHANE EMISSIONS (30.8 +/- 69.8KG CH4-C HA(-1)YR(-1)) WERE LOWER THAN EXPECTED EXCEPT FOR CH4 EMISSIONS FROM NUTRIENT-POOR ACIDIC SITES. AT SINGLE PEATLANDS, CO2 EMISSIONS CLEARLY INCREASED WITH DEEPER MEAN WATER TABLE DEPTH (WTD), BUT THERE WAS NO GENERAL DEPENDENCY OF CO2 ON WTD FOR THE COMPLETE DATA SET. THUS, REGIONALIZATION OF CO2 EMISSIONS BY WTD ONLY WILL REMAIN UNCERTAIN. WTD DYNAMICS EXPLAINED SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PEATLANDS AS SITES WHICH BECAME VERY DRY DURING SUMMER SHOWED LOWER EMISSIONS.

POT EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED BY MIXING THE AMENDMENTS INDEPENDENTLY AT 2% AND 4% (G/G) WITH THE SOIL. THE MOBILITY AND SOLUBILITY OF METALS IN THE TREATMENTS WERE ASSESSED BY MEANS OF RHIZON SOIL MOISTURE SAMPLERS, SEQUENTIAL BCR EXTRACTIONS, AND DIFFUSIVE GRADIENT IN THIN FILMS (DGT). OVER THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD, THE 2% BIOCHAR ADDITION RESULTED IN AN AVERAGE DECREASE IN PORE WATER CONCENTRATION OF 40% FOR CD AND 48% FOR ZN WHEREAS THE 4% ADDITION LED TO AN AVERAGE DECREASE OF 66% FOR CD AND 77% FOR ZN. THE IMMOBILIZATION EFFECT IN THE BIOCHAR TREATMENTS WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE CONSISTENTLY HIGHER PH AND LOWER CONCENTRATIONS OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC) IN THE SOIL. THE LATTER MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SORPTION OF DOC ONTO THE SURFACE OF BIOCHAR THEREBY INCREASING ITS NEGATIVELY CHARGED FUNCTIONAL GROUPS THAT ARE ABLE TO SORB CATIONS. ON THE OTHER HAND, COMPOST AND PEAT HAD THE UNWANTED EFFECT OF SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE CONCENTRATIONS OF CD AND ZN IN THE SOIL PORE WATER. THIS WAS PARTLY DUE TO THE FORMATION OF SOLUBLE ORGANO-METALLIC COMPLEXES AS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DOC CONCENTRATIONS WERE FOUND IN THE COMPOST AND PEAT TREATMENTS.

OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE CR ISOTOPE COMPOSITIONS OF SOILS ARE A FUNCTION OF THE MODAL ABUNDANCE AND WEATHERING RATES OF CR-BEARING MINERALS. THE ACCUMULATION OF WEATHERING RESISTANT CR-SPINELS IN THE SOILS OF NORTHERN IRELAND RESULTS IN SOILS WHICH ARE ENRICHED IN CR AND HAVE DELTA CR-53 VALUES WITHIN THE RANGE OF LOCAL BEDROCK (DELTA CR-53 VALUE OF -0.21 +/- 0.12%, 2 SIGMA, N = 4). BY CONTRAST, THE MORE EASILY WEATHERED CR-SILICATES IN THE BEDROCK OF URUGUAY RESULTS IN GREATER CR LOSS FROM THE SOIL AND A DEPLETION IN THE HEAVY ISOTOPES OF CR (WITH AVERAGE DELTA CR-53 VALUE OF -0.32 +/- 0.04%, 2 SIGMA, N = 4) RELATIVE TO THE LOCAL BEDROCK (DELTA CR-53 VALUE OF -0.22 +/- 0.08%, 2 SIGMA, N = 4). THE RIVER WATERS IN BOTH CATCHMENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY ENRICHED IN THE HEAVY CR-53 ISOTOPE RELATIVE TO BEDROCK, ALTHOUGH THE RANGE AND AVERAGE RIVER WATER DELTA CR-53 VALUES DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN EACH. THE URUGUAY RIVERS EXHIBIT A RESTRICTED RANGE IN DELTA CR-53 VALUES, WITH A MEAN OF +0.08 +/- 0.06% (2 SIGMA, N = 5) THAT REPRESENTS A POSITIVE FRACTIONATION OF +0.2% RELATIVE TO BEDROCK, AND IS BEST EXPLAINED BY THE UNIDIRECTIONAL FORMATION OF CR(VI) DURING WEATHERING THAT HAS NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIED BY BACK-REDUCTION TO CR(III). BY CONTRAST, THE GLENARIFF STREAM AND RIVER WATERS (NORTHERN IRELAND) EXHIBIT A WIDE RANGE IN DELTA CR-53 VALUES FROM -0.17 +/- 0.3% (2 SIGMA, N = 4) TO +1.68 +/- 0.3% (N = 1) THAT APPEARS TO REFLECT THE VARIABLE REDOX CONDITIONS OF THE CATCHMENT. IN GENERAL, THE VALUES WITH THE LOWEST CR-53 ENRICHMENT HAVE HIGHER CR CONCENTRATIONS, THE LOWEST PH, HIGHEST DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC), AND EXHIBIT MINIMAL CE ANOMALIES THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH A GREATER PROPORTION OF CR(III) RELEASED FROM MORE REDUCING (BOG INFLUENCED) STREAM WATERS. THE REMAINING WATERS HAVE LOWER CR CONCENTRATIONS, LOWER DOC, AND MORE PRONOUNCED CE ANOMALIES, INDICATING THAT A GREATER PROPORTION OF CR(VI) UNDERWENT PARTIAL BACK-REDUCTION TO CR(III) EITHER DURING WEATHERING, OR DURING RIVERINE TRANSPORT. OVERALL, THE DOC APPEARS TO EXERT A CONTROL ON THE DISSOLVED CR SPECIATION AND MAGNITUDE OF ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION IN THESE RIVER WATERS. THE BROADER IMPLICATIONS OF THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE THAT THE PREVAILING REDOX CONDITIONS IN A RIVER CATCHMENT STRONGLY INFLUENCE THE DELTA CR-53 VALUE OF THE RIVER WATER FLUX EMPTYING INTO SEAWATER.

IN THIS STUDY, WE PRESENT GHG BALANCES: CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), METHANE (CH4) AND NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) CALCULATED FOR A 5-YEAR PERIOD AT A REWETTED INDUSTRIAL CUTAWAY PEATLAND IN IRELAND (REWETTED 7YEARS PRIOR TO THE START OF THE STUDY); AND COMPARE THE RESULTS WITH AN ADJACENT DRAINED AREA (2-YEAR DATA SET), AND WITH TEN LONG-TERM DATA SETS FROM INTACT (I.E. UNDRAINED) PEATLANDS IN TEMPERATE AND BOREAL REGIONS. IN THE REWETTED SITE, CO2 EXCHANGE (OR NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE (NEE)) WAS STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION (R-ECO) RATHER THAN GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION (GPP). CH4 EMISSIONS WERE RELATED TO SOIL TEMPERATURE AND EITHER WATER TABLE LEVEL OR PLANT BIOMASS. N2O EMISSIONS WERE NOT DETECTED IN EITHER DRAINED OR REWETTED SITES. REWETTING REDUCED CO2 EMISSIONS IN UNVEGETATED AREAS BY APPROXIMATELY 50%. WHEN UPSCALED TO THE ECOSYSTEM LEVEL, THE EMISSION FACTORS (CALCULATED AS 5-YEAR MEAN OF ANNUAL BALANCES) FOR THE REWETTED SITE WERE (+/- SD) -104 +/- 80G CO2-C M(-2)YR(-1) (I.E. CO2 SINK) AND 9 +/- 2G CH4-C M(-2)YR(-1) (I.E. CH4 SOURCE). NEARLY A DECADE AFTER REWETTING, THE GHG BALANCE (100-YEAR GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL) HAD REDUCED NOTICEABLY (I.E. LESS WARMING) IN COMPARISON WITH THE DRAINED SITE BUT WAS STILL HIGHER THAN COMPARATIVE INTACT SITES. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT REWETTED SITES MAY BE MORE SENSITIVE TO INTERANNUAL CHANGES IN WEATHER CONDITIONS THAN THEIR MORE RESILIENT INTACT COUNTERPARTS AND MAY SWITCH FROM AN ANNUAL CO2 SINK TO A SOURCE IF TRIGGERED BY SLIGHTLY DRIER CONDITIONS.","MULTIYEAR GREENHOUSE GAS BALANCES AT A REWETTED TEMPERATE PEATLAND","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","ARTICLE","DEC",2016,"10.1111/gcb.13325","BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000387813300021"

THE COLLOIDS (1 KDA-0.45 MU M) FORMED IN HOT SPOTS WERE STRONGLY ENRICHED IN FE, AL, AND TRIVALENT AND TETRAVALENT HYDROLYSATES RELATIVE TO ORGANIC CARBON.

AS A RESULT, THE WSL'S SURFACE WATER COLLOIDAL COMPOSITION MAY SHIFT FROM DOM-RICH AND DOM-FE-RICH TO DOM-AL-RICH, AND THE RELEASE OF LOW-SOLUBLE TRIVALENT AND TETRAVALENT HYDROLYSATES FROM THE SOIL TO THE RIVER WILL INCREASE. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT IN SITES OF ABRUPT PERMAFROST THAW, THERE IS DIRECT MOBILIZATION OF SOIL WATERS TO A HYDROLOGICAL NETWORK (RIVERS AND LAKES) AND THERE IS MINIMAL TRANSFORMATION BY AUTOCHTHONOUS PROCESSES, WHICH IS UNLIKE THE CASE OF STEADY PERMAFROST THAWING.

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WERE MEASURED CAMPAIGN-WISE WITH MANUAL CHAMBERS EVERY 2 TO 4 WEEKS FOR 2 YEARS AND INTERPOLATED BY MODELLING. ALL SITES HAD NEGLIGIBLE NITROUS OXIDE EXCHANGE RATES. MOST SITES WERE CARBON SINKS AND SMALL GHG SOURCES. METHANE EMISSIONS GENERALLY INCREASED WITH NET ECOSYSTEM CO2 UPTAKE.

DISTINCT ISOTOPIC LABELLING OF SNOW, RAIN, GROUNDWATER AND SURFACE WATER ARE APPLIED TO ESTIMATE THE CONTRIBUTION OF THESE SOURCES TO STREAMFLOW FROM ANALYSIS OF MULTI-YEAR RECORDS OF ISOTOPES IN STREAMFLOW. NEW HYDROLOGICAL INSIGHTS FOR THE REGION: THE RESULTS PROVIDE NEW INSIGHT INTO RUNOFF GENERATION MECHANISMS OPERATING IN SIX TRIBUTARIES AND AT FOUR STATIONS ALONG THE ATHABASCA RIVER. GROUNDWATER, FOUND TO BE AN IMPORTANT FLOW SOURCE AT ALL STATIONS, IS THE DOMINANT COMPONENT OF THE HYDROGRAPH IN THREE TRIBUTARIES (STEEPBANK R., MUSKEG R., FIREBAG R.), ACCOUNTING FOR 39-50% OF ANNUAL STREAMFLOW. SURFACE WATER, MAINLY DRAINAGE FROM PEATLANDS, IS ALSO FOUND TO BE WIDELY IMPORTANT, AND DOMINANT IN THREE TRIBUTARIES (CLEARWATER R., MACKAY R., ELLS R.), ACCOUNTING FOR 45-81% OF ANNUAL STREAMFLOW. FAIRLY LIMITED CONTRIBUTIONS FROM DIRECT PRECIPITATION ILLUSTRATE THAT MOST SNOW AND RAIN EVENTS RESULT IN INDIRECT DISPLACEMENT OF PRE-EVENT WATER BY FILL AND SPILL MECHANISMS.

GEOLOGICAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THESE SEA INGRESSIONS (EXPANSION OF NEW TIDAL SYSTEMS) WERE MAINLY CAUSED BY LAND SUBSIDENCE, WHICH OCCURRED DUE TO INTENSIFIED AGRICULTURAL USE OF ARTIFICIALLY DRAINED PEATLANDS SINCE THE LATE IRON AGE (250-12 BC). THIS MADE THE COASTAL PLAIN SENSITIVE TO STORM-SURGE INGRESSION THROUGH WEAK SPOTS, E.G., AT THE LOCATION OF EXISTING CREEKS, IN THE COASTLINE. USING THE NETHERLANDS AS A CASE STUDY, WE SHOW THAT NATURAL PRECONDITIONS (I.E., THE GEOLOGICAL SETTING AT THE TIME OF INGRESSION) PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE PACING AND EXTENT OF TIDAL AREA EXPANSION. INGRESSIVE TIDAL SYSTEMS EVENTUALLY REACHED MOST FAR INLAND IN COASTAL SEGMENTS WITH WIDE PEATY BACK-BARRIER PLAINS. IN CONTRAST, SEA INGRESSION FORMATION WAS HAMPERED IN COASTAL SEGMENTS WITH WELL-DEVELOPED NATURAL INGRESSION-PROTECTING GEOMORPHIC FEATURES (E.G., BEACH-BARRIERS, SUPRATIDAL LEVEES). FEEDBACK MECHANISMS, SUCH AS ADDITIONAL PEAT SUBSIDENCE BY LOADING OF SEDIMENT IMPORTED INTO THE NEW TIDAL AREA, CAUSED FURTHER TIDAL VOLUME INCREASE AND CREATED ACCOMMODATION SPACE FOR TIDAL DEPOSITS. THESE COMBINED EFFECTS CAUSED IRREVERSIBLE SEA INGRESSION OVER LARGE AREAS THAT CONSEQUENTLY BECAME UNSUITABLE FOR HABITATION FOR MANY CENTURIES. IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF SUCH SEA-INGRESSION MECHANISMS AND THEIR FACILITATING CONDITIONS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF THE SENSITIVITY OF MANY DENSELY POPULATED COASTAL PLAINS, WHICH EXPERIENCE MAJOR HUMAN-INDUCED SUBSIDENCE, EVENTUALLY LEADING TO COASTAL PLAIN DROWNING.

A DATA SET OF PEAT HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES (188 SOIL WATER RETENTION CURVES [SWRCS], 71 UNSATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY CURVES [UHCS], AND 256 SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY [K-S] VALUES) WAS ASSEMBLED FROM THE LITERATURE; THE OBTAINED DATA ORIGINATED FROM PEAT SAMPLES WITH AN ORGANIC MATTER (OM) CONTENT RANGING FROM 23 TO 97 WT% (WEIGHT PERCENT; AND ACCORDING VARIATION IN BULK DENSITY) REPRESENTING VARIOUS DEGREES OF PEAT DEGRADATION.

THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE HYDRAULIC PARAMETERS OF PEAT SOILS VARY OVER A WIDE RANGE CONFIRMING THE PRONOUNCED DIVERSITY OF PEAT. PEAT DECOMPOSITION SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIES ALL HYDRAULIC PARAMETERS. A BULK DENSITY OF APPROXIMATELY 0.2 G CM(-3) WAS IDENTIFIED AS A CRITICAL THRESHOLD POINT; ABOVE AND BELOW THIS VALUE, MACROPOROSITY AND HYDRAULIC PARAMETERS FOLLOW DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS WITH BULK DENSITY. PEDOTRANSFER FUNCTIONS BASED ON PHYSICAL PEAT PROPERTIES (E.G., BULK DENSITY AND SOIL DEPTH) SEPARATELY COMPUTED FOR BOG AND FEN PEAT HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER MEAN SQUARE ERRORS THAN FUNCTIONS OBTAINED FROM THE COMPLETE DATA SET, WHICH INDICATES THAT NOT ONLY THE STATUS OF PEAT DECOMPOSITION BUT ALSO THE PEAT-FORMING PLANTS HAVE A LARGE EFFECT ON HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES.

AGRICULTURE ON REWETTED PEATLANDS (PALUDICULTURE) PROVIDES A SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVE TO DRAINAGE-BASED AGRICULTURE. ONE FORM OF PALUDICULTURE IS THE CULTIVATION OF SPHAGNUM MOSS, WHICH CAN BE USED AS A RAW MATERIAL FOR HORTICULTURAL GROWING MEDIA. UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS, MOST SPHAGNUM MOSSES ELIGIBLE FOR PALUDICULTURE TYPICALLY PREDOMINATE ONLY IN NUTRIENT-POOR WETLAND HABITATS. IT IS UNKNOWN, HOWEVER, HOW THE PREVAILING HIGH NUTRIENT LEVELS IN REWETTED AGRICULTURAL PEATLANDS INTERFERE WITH OPTIMAL SPHAGNUM PRODUCTION. WE THEREFORE STUDIED THE EFFECT OF ENRICHED NUTRIENT CONDITIONS REMAINING EVEN AFTER TOP SOIL REMOVAL AND FURTHER CAUSED BY EXTERNAL SUPPLY OF NUTRIENT-RICH IRRIGATION WATER AND (GENERALLY) HIGH INPUTS OF ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN (N) TO HABITAT BIOGEOCHEMISTRY, BIOMASS PRODUCTION AND NUTRIENT STOICHIOMETRY OF INTRODUCED SPHAGNUM PALUSTRE AND S. PAPILLOSUM IN A REWETTED PEATLAND, WHICH WAS FORMERLY IN INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL USE. AIRBORNE N WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAJOR SUPPLY OF N. PHOSPHORUS (P) AND POTASSIUM (K) WERE MAINLY SUPPLIED BY IRRIGATION WATER. THE PREVAILING HIGH NUTRIENT LEVELS (P AND K) ARE A RESULT OF NUTRIENT-RICH IRRIGATION WATER FROM THE SURROUNDINGS. PEAT POREWATER (10 CM BELOW PEATMOSS SURFACE) CO2 CONCENTRATIONS WERE HIGH, BICARBONATE CONCENTRATIONS LOW, AND THE PH WAS AROUND 4.2. PROVIDED THAT MOISTURE SUPPLY IS SUFFICIENT AND DOMINANCE OF FAST-GROWING, LARGER GRAMINOIDS SUPPRESSED (IN ORDER TO AVOID OUTSHADING OF SPHAGNUM MOSSES), STRIKINGLY VERY HIGH BIOMASS YIELDS OF 6.7 AND 6.5 T DW HA(-1) YR(-1) (S, PALUSTRE AND S. PAPILLOSUM [INCLUDING S. FALLAX BIOMASS], RESPECTIVELY) WERE OBTAINED DESPITE HIGH N SUPPLY AND BIOMASS N CONCENTRATIONS. DESPITE HIGH P AND K SUPPLY AND UPTAKE, N:P AND N:K RATIOS IN THE SPHAGNUM CAPITULA WERE STILL LOW. SPHAGNUM MOSSES ACHIEVED HIGH NUTRIENT SEQUESTRATION RATES OF 34 KG N, 17 KG K AND 4 KG P HA(-1) YR(-1) FROM MAY 2013 TO MAY 2014, WHICH SHOWS THAT THE SITE ACTED AS AN ACTIVE NUTRIENT SINK. NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT STILL NEEDS FURTHER IMPROVEMENT TO REDUCE THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF FAST GROWING PEATMOSS SPECIES (CF. S. FALLAX) AT THE EXPENSE OF SLOWER GROWING BUT PREFERRED PEATMOSSES AS HORTICULTURAL SUBSTRATE (S. PALUSTRE AND S. PAPILLOSUM) TO OPTIMIZE THE QUALITY OF BIOMASS YIELDS. IN CONCLUSION, SPHAGNUM FARMING IS WELL ABLE TO THRIVE UNDER HIGH N INPUT PROVIDED THAT THERE IS A SIMULTANEOUS HIGH INPUT OF P AND K FROM IRRIGATION WATER, WHICH FACILITATES HIGH PRODUCTION RATES. DUE TO THE LACK OF SUITABLE, NUTRIENT POOR SITES, IT SEEMS TO BE USEFUL TO REMOVE THE TOPSOIL (MAINLY P REMOVAL) PRIOR TO START GROWING SPHAGNUM MOSSES.

THEREBY QUALITY OF DOM AFFECTS FUNCTION AND BEHAVIOR OF DOM IN AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS, BUT DOM QUALITY CAN ALSO HELP TO TRACK DOM SOURCES AND THEIR EXPORT DYNAMICS UNDER SPECIFIC HYDROLOGIC PRECONDITIONS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ELUCIDATE CONTROLS ON TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN DOM CONCENTRATION AND QUALITY IN STREAM WATER DRAINING A BOG AND A FORESTED PEATY RIPARIAN ZONE, PARTICULARLY CONSIDERING DROUGHT AND STORM FLOW EVENTS. DOM QUALITY WAS MONITORED USING SPECTROFLUOROMETRIC INDICES FOR AROMATICITY (SUVA(254)), APPARENT MOLECULAR SIZE (S-R) AND PRECURSOR ORGANIC MATERIAL (FI), AS WELL AS PARAFAC MODELING OF EXCITATION EMISSION MATRICES (EEMS). INDICES FOR DOM QUALITY EXHIBITED MAJOR CHANGES DUE TO DIFFERENT HYDROLOGIC CONDITIONS, BUT PATTERNS WERE ALSO DEPENDENT ON SEASON. STREAM WATER AT THE FORESTED SITE WITH MINERAL, PEATY SOILS GENERALLY EXHIBITED HIGHER VARIABILITY IN DOM CONCENTRATIONS AND QUALITY COMPARED TO THE OUTFLOW OF AN OMBROTROPHIC BOG, WHERE DOM WAS LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHANGES IN HYDROLOGIC CONDITIONS. DURING SNOWMELT AND SPRING EVENTS, NEAR-SURFACE PROTEIN-LIKE DOM POOLS WERE EXPORTED. A MICROBIAL DOM FRACTION ORIGINATING FROM GROUND-WATER AND DEEP PEAT LAYERS WAS INCREASING DURING DROUGHT, WHILE A STRONGLY MICROBIALLY ALTERED DOM FRACTION WAS ALSO EXPORTED BY DISCHARGE EVENTS WITH DRY PRECONDITIONS AT THE FORESTED SITE. THIS MIGHT BE DUE TO ACCELERATED MICROBIAL ACTIVITY IN THE PEATY RIPARIAN ZONE OF THE FORESTED SITE UNDER THESE PRECONDITIONS.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE VARIABILITY OF GHG EMISSIONS INCREASES WITH ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE. HOWEVER, HOW AND WHETHER SAND ADDITION AFFECTS GHG EMISSIONS REMAINS A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE. THE AIM OF THIS LONG-TERM INCUBATION EXPERIMENT WAS TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF HYDROLOGICAL AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL SOIL PROPERTIES ON EMISSIONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) AND METHANE (CH4). STRONGLY DEGRADED PEAT WITH SAND ADDITION (PEAT-SAND MIXTURES) AND WITHOUT SAND ADDITION (EARTHIFIED PEAT) WAS SYSTEMATICALLY COMPARED UNDER DIFFERENT MOISTURE CONDITIONS FOR FEN AND BOG PEAT. SOIL COLUMNS ORIGINATING FROM BOTH THE TOPSOIL AND THE SUBSOIL OF TEN DIFFERENT PEATLANDS UNDER GRASSLAND USE WERE INVESTIGATED. OVER A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS THE ALMOST SATURATED SOIL COLUMNS WERE DRAINED STEPWISE VIA SUCTION TO -300 HPA. THE CO2 FLUXES WERE LOWEST AT WATER-SATURATED AND DRY SOIL MOISTURE CONDITIONS, RESULTING IN A PARABOLIC DEPENDENCE OF CO2 FLUXES ON THE WATER-FILLED PORE SPACE (WFPS) PEAKING AT 56-92% WFPS. THE HIGHEST N2O FLUXES WERE FOUND AT BETWEEN 73 AND 95% WFPS. MAXIMUM CO2 FLUXES WERE HIGHEST FROM TOPSOILS, RANGING FROM 21 TO 77 MG C M(-2) H(-1), WHILE THE MAXIMUM CO2 FLUXES FROM SUBSOILS RANGED FROM 3 TO 14 MG C M(-2) H(-1). NO SYSTEMATIC INFLUENCE OF PEAT TYPE OR SAND ADDITION ON GHG EMISSIONS WAS FOUND IN TOPSOILS, BUT CO2 FLUXES FROM SUBSOILS BELOW PEAT-SAND MIXTURES WERE HIGHER THAN FROM SUBSOILS BELOW EARTHIFIED PEAT.

HIGH MAXIMUM CO2 AND N2O FLUXES WERE LINKED TO HIGH DENSITIES OF PLANT-AVAILABLE PHOSPHORUS AND POTASSIUM. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHT THAT NUTRIENT STATUS PLAYS A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE IN GHG EMISSIONS THAN PEAT TYPE OR SAND ADDITION, AND DO NOT SUPPORT THE IDEA OF PEAT-SAND MIXTURES AS A MITIGATION OPTION FOR GHG EMISSIONS.","HOW DO SAND ADDITION, SOIL MOISTURE AND NUTRIENT STATUS INFLUENCE GREENHOUSE GAS FLUXES FROM DRAINED ORGANIC SOILS?","SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY","ARTICLE","AUG",2019,"10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.04.013","SOIL SCIENCE","WOS:000477689700010"

CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION PATTERNS ASSOCIATED WITH NATURAL CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE ARE EXPECTED TO ALTER THE LOAD AND CHARACTER OF ORGANIC MATTER RELEASED FROM THESE AREAS, WHICH ULTIMATELY IMPACTS ON GROUNDWATER QUALITY AND DOM TREATABILITY. IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN GROUNDWATER DOM CHARACTER AFTER RAINFALL RECHARGE, WE SAMPLED SHALLOW GROUNDWATER FROM A COASTAL PEAT-RICH SAND AQUIFER IN NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA, DURING AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF LOW PRECIPITATION (AVERAGE DAILY PRECIPITATION RATE < 1.6 MM DAY(-1) OVER THE 8 MONTHS PRIOR TO SAMPLING), AND AFTER TWO HEAVY PRECIPITATION EVENTS (84 MM DAY(-1) AND 98 MM DAY(-1) RESPECTIVELY).

THOSE CATEGORISED INTO THE GROUPS POLYPHENOLICS AND CONDENSED AROMATICS) WERE 1.7 AND 2.0 TIMES HIGHER RESPECTIVELY THAN IN PRE-RAINFALL SAMPLES. WE ATTRIBUTE THIS TO THE FLUSHING OF PEAT-DERIVED DOM FROM BURIED ORGANIC MATERIAL INTO THE GROUNDWATER. WE ALSO IDENTIFY THAT PERIODS OF LOW PRECIPITATION CAN LEAD TO LOW HYDROPHILIC/HOC RATIOS IN GROUNDWATER (MEDIAN = 4.9, N = 14). REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS (RDA) WAS USED TO COMPARE THE HOC FRACTION WITH FT-ICR MS COMPOUND GROUPS. WE SHOW THAT HOC HAS A MORE AROMATIC CHARACTER IN PRE-RAINFALL SAMPLES, AND IS LESS SIMILAR TO THE AROMATIC GROUPS IN POST-RAINFALL SAMPLES. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE DECLINE IN WATER-BORNE HYDROPHOBICS OBSERVED POST-RAINFALL COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH PREFERENTIAL ADSORPTION OF THE HYDROPHOBIC AROMATIC DOM, MAKING POST-RAINFALL SAMPLES LESS TREATABLE FOR POTABLE WATER SUPPLY.

THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY WERE TO QUANTIFY VERTICAL S-Y VARIATIONS OF WATER TABLES IN PEATLANDS USING THE WATER TABLE FLUCTUATION (WTF) METHOD AND TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE FACTORS CONTROLLING PEATLAND WATER STORAGE CAPACITY. THE METHOD WAS TESTED IN FIVE OMBROTROPHIC PEATLANDS LOCATED IN THE ST. LAWRENCE LOWLANDS (SOUTHERN QUEBEC, CANADA). IN EACH PEATLAND, WATER TABLE WELLS WERE INSTALLED AT THREE LOCATIONS (UP-GRADIENT, MID-GRADIENT, AND DOWN-GRADIENT). NEAR EACH WELL, A 1-M LONG PEAT CORE (8 CM X 8 CM) WAS SAMPLED, AND SUBSAMPLES WERE USED TO DETERMINE S-Y WITH STANDARD GRAVITATIONAL DRAINAGE METHOD. A LARGER PEAT SAMPLE (25 CM X 60 CM X 40 CM) WAS ALSO COLLECTED IN ONE PEATLAND TO ESTIMATE S-Y USING A LABORATORY DRAINAGE METHOD. IN ALL SITES, THE MEAN WATER TABLE DEPTH RANGED FROM 9 TO 49 CM BELOW THE PEAT SURFACE, WITH ANNUAL FLUCTUATIONS VARYING BETWEEN 15 AND 29 CM FOR ALL LOCATIONS. THE WTF METHOD PRODUCED SIMILAR RESULTS TO THE GRAVITATIONAL DRAINAGE EXPERIMENTS, WITH VALUES RANGING BETWEEN 0.13 AND 0.99 FOR THE WTF METHOD AND BETWEEN 0.01 AND 0.95 FOR THE GRAVITATIONAL DRAINAGE EXPERIMENTS. S-Y WAS FOUND TO RAPIDLY DECREASE WITH DEPTH WITHIN 20 CM, INDEPENDENTLY OF THE WITHIN-SITE LOCATION AND THE MEAN ANNUAL WATER TABLE DEPTH. DOMINANT FACTORS EXPLAINING S-Y VARIATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED USING ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE. THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR WAS PEATLAND SITE, FOLLOWED BY PEAT DEPTH AND SEASONALITY. VARIATIONS IN STORAGE CAPACITY CONSIDERING SITE AND SEASONALITY FOLLOWED REGIONAL EFFECTIVE GROWING DEGREE DAYS AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION PATTERNS.

ALTHOUGH HIGHLY DECOMPOSED PEAT RELEASED MORE OR LESS NO METHANE, DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER MOBILIZATION WAS HIGHEST IN THIS SUBSTRATE WHILE LESS DECOMPOSED PEAT WAS CHARACTERIZED IN GENERAL BY LOWEST RATES OF MOBILIZATION. 4.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE AND ROOT ADDITIONS ON SOIL CARBON AND NITROGEN MINERALIZATION AS WELL AS THE MECHANISMS DRIVING MINERALIZATION IN A HIGH LATITUDE PERMAFROST PEATLAND IN THE DA XING'AN MOUNTAINS, NORTHEAST CHINA. WE INVESTIGATED CHANGES IN SHALLOW SOIL (0-15 CM) AND DEEP SOIL (15-30 CM) CARBON MINERALIZATION, AVAILABLE N CONTENTS, MICROBIAL BIOMASS CARBON (MBC), DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC), AND ENZYME ACTIVITIES IN RESPONSE TO INCREASING TEMPERATURE AND ERIOPHORUM VAGINATUM ROOT ADDITIONS BY USING AN INCUBATION EXPERIMENT. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT ELEVATED TEMPERATURE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SOIL CARBON MINERALIZATION. THE Q(10) VALUES OF THE CARBON MINERALIZATION RATES IN THE SHALLOW SOIL AND DEEP SOIL WERE 3.95 AND 2.91, RESPECTIVELY. IN CONTRAST, THE SOIL MBC AND DOC DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, CONFIRMING THAT LABILE CARBON IS THE MAIN DRIVING FORCE OF MICROBIAL MINERALIZATION ACTIVITIES UNDER WARMING CONDITIONS. ELEVATED TEMPERATURE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE SHALLOW SOIL NET N MINERALIZATION RATES AND INCREASED THE NET NITRIFICATION RATES IN BOTH SOIL LAYERS. AT HIGH TEMPERATURES, AMMONIFICATION RATES INCREASED IN THE SHALLOW SOIL BUT DECREASED IN THE DEEP SOIL. THE INCREASE IN THE INCUBATION TEMPERATURE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SHALLOW SOIL BETA-GLUCOSIDASE ACTIVITY AND DECREASED INVERTASE ACTIVITY. THIS SUGGESTS THE INCREASED PRODUCTION OF COMPLEX SUBSTRATE ENZYMES, AND DECREASED PRODUCTION OF SIMPLE SUBSTRATE-ACQUIRING ENZYMES. THE ROOT ADDITIONS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE SOIL C MINERALIZATION AND STIMULATED THE SECRETION OF INVERTASE BY SOIL MICROORGANISMS. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT FUTURE CLIMATE WARMING IN THE NORTHERN HIGH LATITUDE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY STIMULATE SOIL CARBON AND NITROGEN MINERALIZATION IN PERMAFROST PEATLANDS.

WE MONITORED PORE- AND SURFACE-WATER CHEMISTRY ACROSS A CHRONOSEQUENCE OF FORMERLY DRAINED, AFFORESTED BOG RESTORATION SITES SPANNING 0-17 YEARS, USING A SPACE-FOR-TIME SUBSTITUTION, AND COMPARED THEM WITH OPEN BLANKET BOG CONTROL SITES. OUR AIMS WERE TO MEASURE RATE OF RECOVERY TOWARDS BOG CONDITIONS AND TO IDENTIFY THE BEST SUITE OF WATER CHEMISTRY VARIABLES TO INDICATE RECOVERY. OUR RESULTS SHOW PROGRESS IN RECOVERY TOWARDS BOG CONDITIONS OVER A 0-17 YEAR PERIOD POST-RESTORATION. ELEMENTS SCAVENGED BY TREES (MG, NA, S) COMPLETELY RECOVERED WITHIN THAT PERIOD. MANY WATER CHEMISTRY VARIABLES WERE AFFECTED BY THE RESTORATION PROCESS ITSELF, BUT RECOVERED WITHIN 11 YEARS, EXCEPT AMMONIUM (NH4+), ZN AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC) WHICH REMAINED ELEVATED (WHEN COMPARED TO CONTROL BOGS) 17 YEARS POST RESTORATION. OTHER VARIABLES DID NOT COMPLETELY RECOVER (WATER TABLE DEPTH (WTD), PH), EXHIBITING WHAT WE TERM ""LEGACY"" EFFECTS OF DRAINAGE AND AFFORESTATION. EXCESS N AND A LOWERED WTD ARE LIKELY TO SLOW THE RECOVERY OF BOG VEGETATION INCLUDING KEY BOG PLANTS SUCH AS SPHAGNUM MOSSES.

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF WARMING, OXIDIZING BY DRYING OR THEIR COMBINATION ON CARBON DECOMPOSITION AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS (0-100 CM) OF PEAT. IN THIS RESEARCH, SOIL OF DIFFERENT DEPTHS FROM ZOIGE PLATEAU WAS INCUBATED IN FOUR SCENARIOS (8 DEGREES C-ANAEROBIC, 8 DEGREES C-AEROBIC, 18 DEGREES C-ANAEROBIC AND 18 DEGREES C-AEROBIC) TO DETECT THE EXPORTED CARBON. OUR RESULT SHOWED THAT SOIL RESPIRATION (RS) INCREASED OBVIOUSLY WITH ENHANCED TEMPERATURE AND OXYGEN. THE TOTAL CO2 FLUXES OF 2400.22 +/- 57.69 MG M(-2) D(-1) UNDER 8 DEGREES C-ANAEROBIC CONDITION INCREASED BY 73.6%, 40.7% AND 176.5% WITH WARMING, OXIDIZING AND THEIR COMBINED EFFECT, RESPECTIVELY.

RS AND ITS VARIATION UNDERWARMING AND OXIDIZATION DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG DIFFERENT DEPTHS, PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE DIFFERENCES OF SOIL SUBSTRATE, ESPECIALLY THE VARIATION IN DISTRIBUTION OF SOIL MICROBES AND ENZYMES AMONG DEPTHS OF PEATLANDS. BY CLASSIFYING THE SOURCE OF RS AS YOUNG SOIL (YS: 0-20 CM) AND OLD SOIL (OS: 21-100 CM), THIS RESEAERCH FOUND THAT OS ACCOUNTED FOR A HUGE PART OF TOTAL RS UNDER 8 DEGREES C-ANAEROBIC CONDITION (CO2: 74.2%; DOC: 60.7%).

SURPRISINGLY, HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF THIS DUAL POROSITY ON DOC TRANSPORT HAVE NOT YET BEEN EXPLORED. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL CONTROLS ON DOC CONCENTRATIONS IN A PEAT -SAND MIXTURE BY MEANS OF A SATURATED COLUMN EXPERIMENT WITH UNDISTURBED COLUMNS. THE SOIL CAME FROM A FORMER BOG IN NORTHERN GERMANY WHERE PEAT LAYERS REMAINING AFTER PEAT EXTRACTION WERE MIXED WITH THE UNDERLYING MINERAL SOIL BY PLOUGHING. THREE PUMPING RATES AND TWO LEVELS OF ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY (EC) WERE APPLIED. THE TRANSPORT PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL WERE OBTAINED BY ANALYSING BREAKTHROUGH CURVES OF POTASSIUM BROMIDE USING THE TRANSPORT MODEL STANMOD, WHICH IS BASED ON THE TWO -REGION NON -EQUILIBRIUM CONCEPT. THE RESULTS OF THE COLUMN STUDY WERE COMPARED TO DOC CONCENTRATIONS MEASURED BI-WEEKLY FOR TWO YEARS AT THE FIELD SITE FROM WHERE THE COLUMNS WERE TAKEN. DESPITE A SIMILAR TEXTURE AND SOIL ORGANIC CARBON (SOC) CONTENT, THE FRACTION OF THE MOBILE ZONE IN THE COLUMNS VARIED BETWEEN 51% AND 100% OF TOTAL POROSITY. THUS EVEN HEAVILY DEGRADED ORGANIC SOILS MIXED WITH SAND STILL SHOWED A DUAL POROSITY COMPARABLE TO DEGRADED PEAT SOILS. PERCOLATING THE COLUMNS WITH THE HIGH EC SOLUTION CAUSED LOW PH VALUES, PROBABLY DUE TO ION EXCHANGE AND CATION BRIDGING. THE COMBINATION OF HIGH EC AND LOW PH GREATLY DECREASED DOC CONCENTRATIONS AT THE OUTLET OF THE COLUMNS. DOC CONCENTRATIONS DECREASED AND FLUXES INCREASED AS THE PUMPING RATES INCREASED. TAKING PORE WATER VELOCITY IN THE MOBILE ZONE INTO ACCOUNT COULD HELP TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COLUMNS. OVERALL, TRANSPORT OF DOC DID NOT SEEM TO BE LIMITED BY PRODUCTION OF DOC, BUT BY RATE -LIMITED EXCHANGE PROCESSES. IN CONTRAST TO THE COLUMN EXPERIMENT, FIELD CONCENTRATIONS OF DOC WERE MUCH HIGHER AND WERE NOT RELATED TO PH, BUT INCREASED WITH HIGHER ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY. THESE HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS COULD BE EXPLAINED BY LOW PORE WATER VELOCITIES AND THE SLIGHTLY HIGHER SOC CONTENT IN THE FIELD. THIS FIRST EXPERIMENT ON DOC TRANSPORT IN PEAT -SAND MIXTURES TAKING THE DUAL -POROSITY NATURE OF ORGANIC SOILS INTO ACCOUNT CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THE IMPORTANCE OF PORE WATER VELOCITY AND THUS THE RESIDENCE TIME FOR DOC CONCENTRATIONS.

WE INVESTIGATED HOW RUNOFF GENERATION PROCESSES IN A SMALL, RIPARIAN PEATLAND-DOMINATED HEADWATER CATCHMENT (0.65 KM(2)) PROPAGATE TO LARGER SCALES (3.2 KM(2) AND 31 KM(2)) WITH DECREASING PERCENTAGE OF RIPARIAN PEATLAND COVERAGE. ISOTOPE DAMPING WAS MOST PRONOUNCED IN THE 0.65 KM(2) HEADWATER CATCHMENT DUE TO HIGH WATER STORAGE IN THE ORGANIC SOILS ENCOURAGING TRACER MIXING. AT THE LARGEST SCALE, STREAM FLOW AND WATER ISOTOPE DYNAMICS SHOWED A MORE FLASHY RESPONSE. THE ISOTOPIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SITES WAS MOST PRONOUNCED IN THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN STREAM WATER SIGNATURES WERE ENRICHED. DURING THE WINTER MONTHS, THE INTER SITE DIFFERENCE REDUCED. THE ISOTOPES ALSO REVEALED EVAPORATIVE FRACTIONATION IN THE PEATLAND DOMINATED CATCHMENT, IN PARTICULAR DURING SUMMER LOW FLOWS, WHICH IMPLIED HIGH HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY IN THE FORM OF CONSTANT SEEPAGE FROM THE PEATLANDS SUSTAINING HIGH BASEFLOWS AT THE HEADWATER SCALE. THIS CONNECTIVITY RESULTED IN HIGH DOC CONCENTRATIONS AT THE PEATLAND SITE DURING BASEFLOW (SIMILAR TO 5 MG L(-1)). IN CONTRAST, AT THE LARGER SCALES, DOC WAS MINIMAL DURING LOW FLOWS (SIMILAR TO 2 MGL(-1)) DUE TO INCREASED GROUND-WATER INFLUENCE AND THE DISCONNECTION BETWEEN DOC SOURCES AND THE STREAM.

VASCULAR PLANTS, WHICH OFTEN DOMINATE RESTORED SITES, PLAY A KEY ROLE IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF EMITTED CH4: THE PLANTS CAN EITHER FUEL METHANOGENESIS BY SUPPLYING LABILE CARBON OR ATTENUATE METHANOGENESIS BY TRANSFERRING OXYGEN INTO THE RHIZOSPHERE. TO QUANTIFY THE NET EFFECT OF THESE COUNTERACTING PROCESSES, WE TESTED IN A TWO-PRONGED APPROACH CH4 PRODUCTION, EMISSION, AND THE UNDERLYING PROCESSES IN (1.)

WHILE INORGANIC ELECTRON ACCEPTOR POOLS WERE SMALL AND RAPIDLY DIMINISHED, DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER PROVIDED CONSTANT ELECTRON ACCEPTOR CAPACITY, INDICATING THAT REDUCIBLE MOIETIES IN THE ORGANIC MATTER WERE CONTINUOUSLY RE-OXIDIZED IN THE RHIZOSPHERE OF ALL TESTED VASCULAR PLANT SPECIES.

THE METHODS WERE APPLIED TO A PEAT DITCH AND A DITCH WITH A THIN PEAT LAYER OVERLAYING EROSION SENSITIVE MINERAL SOIL WITHIN A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS FOLLOWING DITCH CLEANING. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT EROSION WAS GREATER IN THE DITCH WITH EXPOSED MINERAL SOIL THAN IN THE PEAT DITCH.

THE TLS-BASED EROSION AND DEPOSITION QUANTITIES DEPENDED ON THE SIZE OF THE SAMPLING WINDOW USED IN THE ESTIMATIONS. SURFACE ROUGHNESS WAS SMALLER WHEN CALCULATED FROM THE PIN METER DATA THAN FROM THE TLS DATA. BOTH METHODS INDICATED THAT ROUGHNESS INCREASED IN THE BANKS OF THE DITCH WITH A THIN PEAT LAYER.

THE WATERS OF THE LITORINA SEA FLOODED THE STUDY AREA BETWEEN 8200 AND 7700CAL. A BP, FORMING A 25-KM-LONG AND UP TO 5.5-M-DEEP LAGOON WITH TWO CONNECTIONS TO THE SEA. THIS BRACKISH WATER LAGOON EXISTED IN THE AREA FOR ABOUT 4000YEARS AND TERMINATED AROUND 3800-3500CAL. A BP AS A RESULT OF ISOSTATIC UPLIFT AND GROWTH OF THE BARRIER SPIT. THE RECONSTRUCTIONS ILLUSTRATE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE LAGOONAL SYSTEM AND THREE MESOLITHIC AND NEOLITHIC SETTLEMENT SITES FOUND IN THE STUDY AREA. A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WHICH BESIDES PALAEOGEOGRAPHICAL AND ECOLOGICAL DATA INCLUDED A DATA SET WITH MORE THAN 100 STONE AGE SITES FROM THE EASTERN BALTIC REGION, WAS USED TO PROPOSE THE MOST SUITABLE LOCATIONS FOR COASTAL SETTLEMENTS IN THE TOLKUSE-RANNAMETSA AREA. HOWEVER, SOME OF THESE AREAS ARE PRESENTLY COVERED BY A PEAT LAYER THAT IS SEVERAL METRES THICK, WHICH MAY EXPLAIN THE RELATIVE SCARCITY OF THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL FINDS ON THE SHORES OF THE PALAEO-LAGOON.

OLD C (>1,000YEARS BP) MAY BE MASKED BY POSTBOMB C (FIXED FROM THE ATMOSPHERE POST-1950 CE), POTENTIALLY RENDERING BULK AQUATIC DISSOLVED ORGANIC C (DOC) C-14 MEASUREMENTS INSENSITIVE TO OLD C. WE COLLECTED DOC WITH A MODERN C-14 SIGNATURE FROM A TEMPERATE SCOTTISH PEATLAND STREAM AND DECOMPOSED IT TO PRODUCE CO2 UNDER SIMULATED NATURAL CONDITIONS OVER 140DAYS. WE MEASURED THE C-14 OF BOTH DOC AND CO2 AT SEVEN TIME POINTS AND FOUND THAT WHILE DOC REMAINED CLOSE TO MODERN IN AGE, THE RESULTANT CO2 PROGRESSIVELY INCREASED IN AGE UP TO 2,356767YEARS BP. THE RESULTS OF THIS EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATE THAT THE BULK (DOC)-C-14 POOL CAN HIDE THE PRESENCE OF OLD C WITHIN PEATLAND STREAM DOC EXPORT, DEMONSTRATING THAT BULK (DOC)-C-14 MEASUREMENTS CAN BE AN INSENSITIVE INDICATOR OF PEATLAND DISTURBANCE. OUR EXPERIMENT ALSO DEMONSTRATES THAT THIS OLD C COMPONENT IS BIOLOGICALLY AND PHOTOCHEMICALLY AVAILABLE FOR CONVERSION TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS CO2, AND AS SUCH, BULK (DOC)-C-14 MEASUREMENTS DO NOT REFLECT THE C-14 SIGNATURE OF THE LABILE ORGANIC C POOL EXPORTED BY INLAND WATER SYSTEMS MORE BROADLY. MOREOVER, OUR EXPERIMENT SUGGESTS THAT OLD C MAY BE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF CO2 EMISSIONS TO THE ATMOSPHERE FROM PEATLAND AQUATIC SYSTEMS, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR TRACING AND MODELING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE HYDROLOGICAL AND TERRESTRIAL C CYCLES. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY THE INTRODUCTION OF OLD CARBON PREVIOUSLY STORED IN SOILS FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS INTO RIVERS CAN INCREASE THE NET FLUX OF GREENHOUSE GASES TO THE ATMOSPHERE, IMPACTING GLOBAL CLIMATE. THIS IS BECAUSE RIVERS TRANSPORT THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE THIRD OF HUMAN CARBON EMISSIONS ANNUALLY FROM LAND TO THE OCEANS. MUCH RIVER-BORNE CARBON IS PLANT AND SOIL (ORGANIC) MATTER THAT CAN DECOMPOSE DURING TRANSPORT, RELEASING GREENHOUSE GASES TO THE ATMOSPHERE. RADIOCARBON DATING CAN REVEAL THE AGE OF RIVER-BORNE CARBON, BUT PREVIOUS MEASUREMENTS MAY HAVE UNDERESTIMATED THE AGE OF CARBON RELEASED INTO RIVERS BY NOT CONSIDERING THE POTENTIAL FOR OLD CARBON HIDDEN WITHIN INDIVIDUAL BULK WATER SAMPLES. USING AN INCUBATION EXPERIMENT, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON FROM A SCOTTISH PEATLAND STREAM THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED MODERN IN AGE USING TRADITIONAL BULK RADIOCARBON DATING CAN READILY DECOMPOSE TO PRODUCE CARBON DIOXIDE WITH AN OLD RADIOCARBON SIGNATURE UP TO SIMILAR TO 2,500YEARS OLD. THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT RADIOCARBON DATING OF BULK RIVERINE DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON CAN HIDE THE PRESENCE OF OLD CARBON. FURTHERMORE, THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT OLD CARBON MAY BE MORE COMMON IN THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT, WITH IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING AND MODELING OF PEATLAND ECOSYSTEMS.","THE POTENTIAL HIDDEN AGE OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON EXPORTED BY PEATLAND STREAMS","JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES","ARTICLE","FEB",2019,"10.1029/2018JG004650","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000460859100009"

THE COMPOSITION OF LIGNIN REACTION PRODUCTS IN TERMS OF THE SYRINGYL, CINNAMYL, AND VANILLYL COMPOSITIONS INDICATE MIXED SOURCES OF VASCULAR LAND PLANT-DERIVED ORGANIC CARBON, WITH WOODY GYMNOSPERMS CONTRIBUTIONS DOMINATING IN THE SOUTHERN RIVER BASINS WHEREAS NONWOODY ANGIOSPERM SOURCES WERE MORE IMPORTANT IN THE MOST NORTHERLY RIVERS. THE COMPOSITION OF NONLIGNIN AROMATIC COMPOUNDS, WHICH PROVIDES A TRACER FOR NONVASCULAR PLANT CONTRIBUTIONS, SUGGESTS STRONGER CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SPHAGNUM MOSSES TO DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER IN RIVERS BELOW THE TREE LINE, INCLUDING THOSE WITH LARGE PEAT BOGS IN THEIR BASINS.

THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF (I) MIXING PEAT WITH SAND AND (II) WATER TABLE DEPTH (WTD) ON DOC CONCENTRATIONS AT THREE GRASSLAND SITES ON SHALLOW ORGANIC SOILS. THE SOIL SOLUTION WAS SAMPLED BI-WEEKLY FOR TWO YEARS WITH SUCTION PLATES AT 15, 30 AND 60 CM DEPTH.

THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF SOIL ORGANIC CARBON (SOC) CONTENT OR WTD ON MEAN DOC CONCENTRATIONS. AT ALL SITES, DOC CONCENTRATIONS WERE HIGHEST AT THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE SOC-RICH HORIZON AND THE MINERAL SUBSOIL. IN CONTRAST TO THE MEAN CONCENTRATIONS, THE TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF DOC CONCENTRATIONS, THEIR DRIVERS AND THE PROPERTIES OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER (DOM) DIFFERED BETWEEN PEAT-SAND MIXTURES AND PEAT. DOC CONCENTRATIONS RESPONDED TO CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, BUT ONLY AFTER A LAG PERIOD OF A FEW WEEKS.

AT THE PEAT SITE, THE CONTRIBUTION OF VEGETATION DERIVED DOM WAS HIGHER. THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS OCCURRED DURING LONG, COOL PERIODS OF WATERLOGGING, SUGGESTING A STRONGER PHYSICOCHEMICAL-BASED DOC MOBILISATION.

OUR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM CONSISTED OF SIX TRANSPARENT CHAMBERS AND STAINLESS STEEL FRAMES, POSITIONED ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FIELD AND MOSS LAYER COMPOSITIONS. GAS CONCENTRATIONS WERE MEASURED WITH AN ONLINE CAVITY RING-DOWN SPECTROSCOPY GAS ANALYZER. FLUXES WERE CALCULATED WITH BOTH LINEAR AND EXPONENTIAL REGRESSION. THE USE OF LINEAR REGRESSION RESULTED IN SYSTEMATICALLY SMALLER CH4 FLUXES BY 10-45% AS COMPARED TO EXPONENTIAL REGRESSION. HOWEVER, THE USE OF EXPONENTIAL REGRESSION WITH SMALL FLUXES (<2.5 MU GCH(4) M(-2) H(-1)) TYPICALLY RESULTED IN ANOMALOUSLY LARGE ABSOLUTE FLUXES AND HIGH HOUR-TO-HOUR DEVIATIONS. THEREFORE, WE RECOMMEND THAT FLUXES ARE INITIALLY CALCULATED WITH LINEAR REGRESSION TO DETERMINE THE THRESHOLD FOR ""LOW"" FLUXES AND THAT HIGHER FLUXES ARE THEN RECALCULATED USING EXPONENTIAL REGRESSION. THE EXPONENTIAL FLUX WAS CLEARLY AFFECTED BY THE LENGTH OF THE FITTING PERIOD WHEN THIS PERIOD WAS <190 S, BUT STABILIZED WITH LONGER PERIODS. THUS, WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE USE OF A FITTING PERIOD OF SEVERAL MINUTES TO STABILIZE THE RESULTS AND DECREASE THE FLUX DETECTION LIMIT. THERE WERE CLEAR SEASONAL DYNAMICS IN THE CH4 FLUX: THE FOREST FLOOR ACTED AS A CH4 SINK PARTICULARLY FROM EARLY SUMMER UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, WHILE IN LATE WINTER THE FLUX WAS VERY SMALL AND FLUCTUATED AROUND ZERO.

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE COMMON APPROACHES FOR QUANTIFYING CO2 EXCHANGE AT THREE METHODOLOGICAL LEVELS. (1) THE FIRST LEVEL INCLUDED TWO DIFFERENT CO2 FLUX MEASUREMENT METHODS: ONE VIA MEASUREMENTS DURING MID-DAY APPLYING NET COVERAGES (MID-DAY APPROACH) AND ONE VIA MEASUREMENTS FROM SUNRISE TO NOON (SUNRISE APPROACH) TO CAPTURE A SPAN OF LIGHT CONDITIONS FOR MEASUREMENTS OF NEE WITH TRANSPARENT CHAMBERS. (2) THE SECOND LEVEL INCLUDED THREE DIFFERENT METHODS OF POOLING MEASURED ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION (R-ECO) FLUXES FOR EMPIRICAL MODELING OF R-ECO: CAMPAIGN-WISE (19 SINGLE-MEASUREMENT-DAY R-ECO MODELS), SEASON-WISE (ONE R-ECO MODEL FOR THE ENTIRE STUDY PERIOD), AND CLUSTER-WISE (TWO R-ECO MODELS REPRESENTING A LOW AND A HIGH VEGETATION STATUS). (3) THE THIRD LEVEL INCLUDED TWO DIFFERENT METHODS OF DERIVING FLUXES OF GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION (GPP): BY SUBTRACTING EITHER PROXIMATELY MEASURED R-ECO FLUXES (DIRECT GPP MODELING) OR EMPIRICALLY MODELED R-ECO FLUXES FROM MEASURED NEE FLUXES (INDIRECT GPP MODELING).

IN CLEAR-CUTTING, STEM WOOD IS REMOVED AND THE LOGGING RESIDUES ARE EITHER REMOVED OR LEFT ON SITE. CLEAR-CUTTING CHANGES THE MICROCLIMATE AND VEGETATION STRUCTURE AT THE SITE, BOTH OF WHICH AFFECT THE SITE'S CARBON BALANCE. PEAT SOILS WITH POOR AERATION AND HIGH CARBON DENSITIES ARE ESPECIALLY PRONE TO SUCH CHANGES, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN GREENHOUSE GAS EXCHANGE CAN BE EXPECTED. WE MEASURED CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) AND ENERGY FLUXES WITH THE EDDY COVARIANCE METHOD FOR 2 YEARS (APRIL 2016-MARCH 2018) AFTER CLEAR-CUTTING A DRAINED PEATLAND FOREST. WE OBSERVED A SIGNIFICANT RISE (23 CM) IN THE WATER TABLE LEVEL AND A LARGE CO2 SOURCE (FIRST YEAR: 3086 +/- 148 G CO2 M(-2) YR(-1); SECOND YEAR: 2072 +/- 124 G CO2 M(-2) YR(-1)). THESE LARGE CO2 EMISSIONS RESULTED FROM THE VERY LOW GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION (GPP) FOLLOWING THE REMOVAL OF PHOTOSYNTHESIZING TREES AND THE DECLINE OF GROUND VEGETATION, UNABLE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE DECOMPOSITION OF LOGGING RESIDUES AND PEAT. DURING THE SECOND SUMMER (JUNE-AUGUST) AFTER THE CLEAR-CUTTING, GPP HAD ALREADY INCREASED BY 96% AND TOTAL ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION DECREASED BY 14% FROM THE PREVIOUS SUMMER. THE MEAN DAYTIME RATIO OF SENSIBLE TO LATENT HEAT FLUX DECREASED AFTER HARVESTING FROM 2.6 IN MAY 2016 TO 1.0 IN AUGUST 2016, AND IN 2017 IT VARIED MOSTLY WITHIN 0.6-1.0. IN APRIL-SEPTEMBER, THE MEAN DAYTIME SENSIBLE HEAT FLUX WAS 33% LOWER AND LATENT HEAT FLUX 40% HIGHER IN 2017, PROBABLY DUE TO THE RECOVERY OF GROUND VEGETATION THAT INCREASED EVAPOTRANSPIRATION AND ALBEDO OF THE SITE. IN ADDITION TO CO2 AND ENERGY FLUXES, WE MEASURED METHANE (CH4) AND NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) FLUXES WITH MANUAL CHAMBERS.

THE DOM THAT ORIGINATES FROM TOPSOIL LEACHING AND VEGETATION DEGRADATION IS BROUGHT TO THE LAKES BY SURFACE FLOW AND IS SUBJECTED TO COAGULATION AND DEGRADATION BY HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIA, WHICH ARE WELL-ESTABLISHED PROCESSES IN THE MAJORITY OF BOREAL AQUATIC SETTINGS. THE BEHAVIOR OF COLLOIDS AND ORGANIC COMPLEXES OF TRACE METALS DURING THIS PROCESS IS VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN. IN THIS WORK, WE STUDIED THE INTERACTION OF TWO MODEL HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIA, SOIL PSEUDOMONAS AUREOFACIENS AND AQUATIC PSEUDOMONAS REACTANS, WITH PEAT AND SPHAGNUM MOSS LEACHATES FROM THE PERMAFROST REGION UNDER CONTROLLED LABORATORY CONDITIONS IN NUTRIENT-FREE MEDIA.

TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTROL OF BELOW ICE C DYNAMICS, AND C EMISSIONS IN SPRING, WE MEASURED SPATIAL VARIATION IN CO2, CH4, AND DISSOLVED INORGANIC AND ORGANIC CARBON FROM ICE-ON TO ICE-OFF, IN A SMALL BOREAL LAKE DURING A WINTER WITH SPORADIC MELTING EVENTS. WINTER MELT EVENTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED SURFACE WATER DOC IN THE FOREST-DOMINATED BASIN AND INCREASED SURFACE WATER CH4 IN THE MIRE-DOMINATED BASIN. AT THE WHOLE-LAKE SCALE, CH4 ACCUMULATED BELOW ICE THROUGHOUT THE WINTER, WHEREAS CO2 ACCUMULATION WAS GREATEST IN EARLY WINTER.

AN OBJECT BASED IMAGE ANALYSIS (OBIA) WAS PERFORMED ON A VERY HIGH RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGE (GEOEYE-1) TO EXTRACT INFORMATION ABOUT DRAIN LOCATION AND EXTENT ON A BLANKET PEATLAND IN IRELAND. TWO ACCURACY ASSESSMENT METHODS: ERROR MATRIX AND THE COMPLETENESS, CORRECTNESS AND QUALITY (CCQ) WERE USED TO ASSESS THE EXTRACTED DATA ACROSS THE PEATLAND AND AT SEVERAL SUB SITES. THE COST OF THE OBIA METHOD WAS COMPARED WITH MANUAL DIGITISATION AND FIELD SURVEY. THE DRAIN MAPS WERE ALSO USED TO ASSESS THE COSTS RELATING TO BLOCKING DRAINS VS. A BUSINESS-AS-USUAL SCENARIO AND ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF EACH ON CARBON FLUXES AT THE STUDY SITE. RESULTS: THE OBIA METHOD PERFORMED WELL AT ALMOST ALL SITES. ALMOST 500 KM OF DRAINS WERE DETECTED WITHIN THE PEATLAND. IN THE ERROR MATRIX METHOD, OVERALL ACCURACY (OA) OF DETECTING THE DRAINS WAS 94% AND THE KAPPA STATISTIC WAS 0.66. THE OA FOR ALL SUB-AREAS, EXCEPT ONE, WAS 95-97%. THE CCQ WAS 85%, 85% AND 71% RESPECTIVELY.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF METHODS TO MAP THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF DRAINS IS IMPORTANT AS THEY PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN PEATLAND CARBON DYNAMICS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXTRACT DATA ON THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF DRAINS ON A BLANKET BOG IN THE WEST OF IRELAND.

WATERSHED SLOPE INFLUENCES C LOADING AND STREAM CO2 FLUXES BY CONTROLLING CARBON ACCUMULATION IN WATERSHEDS AND TO A LESSER EXTENT BY DETERMINING GAS TRANSFER VELOCITY ACROSS THE STREAM AIR-WATER INTERFACE. LOW GAS TRANSFER VELOCITY IN FLAT STREAMS OFFSETS SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER TERRESTRIAL C LOADING AT THOSE SITES, RESULTING IN LOWER THAN EXPECTED VERTICAL CO2 FLUXES. WHILE THE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF STREAM DIC (DELTA C-14 AND DELTA C-13) WAS HIGHLY VARIABLE ACROSS SPACE AND TIME, SHIFTS TOWARD CONTEMPORARY, TERRESTRIAL SOURCES AFTER PRECIPITATION WERE MOST PRONOUNCED IN FLAT WATERSHEDS. AT BASE FLOW DIC WAS A MIXTURE OF MODERN AND AGED SOURCES OF BIOGENIC AND GEOLOGIC ORIGIN (DELTA C-14, -198.3 PARTS PER THOUSAND TO 27.9 PARTS PER THOUSAND, N=23). AGED (DELTA C-14-DEPLETED) C SOURCES CONTRIBUTED TO FOOD WEBS VIA A PATHWAY FROM DIC TO ALGAE TO INVERTEBRATE GRAZERS.

HERE WE PRESENT IN SITU CH4 AND CO2 FLUX MEASUREMENTS FROM A WET HEATH ECOSYSTEM IN NORTHERN SWEDEN SUBJECTED TO 16 YEARS OF MANIPULATIONS, INCLUDING SUMMER WARMING WITH OPEN-TOP CHAMBERS, BIRCH LEAF LITTER ADDITION, AND THE COMBINATION THEREOF. THROUGHOUT THE SNOW-FREE SEASON, THE ECOSYSTEM WAS A NET SINK OF CH4 AND CO2 (CH4 -0.27 MG C M(-2) D(-1); NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE -1827 MG C M(-2) D(-1)), WITH HIGHEST CH4 UPTAKE RATES (-0.70 MG C M(-2) D(-1)) DURING FALL. WARMING ENHANCED NET CO2 FLUX, WHILE NET CH4 FLUX WAS GOVERNED BY SOIL MOISTURE. LITTER ADDITION AND THE COMBINATION WITH WARMING SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED CH4 UPTAKE RATES, EXPLAINED BY A PRONOUNCED SOIL DRYING EFFECT OF UP TO 32% RELATIVE TO AMBIENT CONDITIONS. BOTH WARMING AND LITTER ADDITION ALSO INCREASED THE SEASONAL AVERAGE CONCENTRATION OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON IN THE SOIL.

A HIGHER RELATIVE PROPORTION OF FUNGAL-SPECIFIC PLFA 18:2 OMEGA 6 AND AN INCREASED FUNGAL:BACTERIAL RATIO INDICATED THAT FUNGI BENEFITED FROM THE HIGHER AMOUNT OF WOOD ASH IN THE TOPMOST LAYER. ALSO, THE LOWER AMOUNT OF WOOD ASH SEEMED TO HAVE STIMULATED ACTINOBACTERIA. OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT HIGHER PH AND EXTRA NUTRIENTS DUE TO WOOD ASH FERTILIZATION PROMOTED THE APPEARANCE OF MYCORRHIZAL AND WOOD-DECOMPOSING FUNGI DIRECTLY OR VIA INCREASED TREE GROWTH.

WE COMBINED PLOT- AND LANDSCAPE-SCALE DATA FROM A RANGE OF FOREST TYPES VARYING IN SOIL MOISTURE AND NUTRIENT RICHNESS IN ESTONIA, AND COMPILED A LANDSCAPE RETROSPECTIVE OF BILBERRY ABUNDANCE. CLEAR-CUTTING SHARPLY REDUCED BILBERRY ABUNDANCE ON MINERAL SOILS AND GREEN-TREE RETENTION ONLY SLIGHTLY MITIGATED THAT IMPACT; HOWEVER, IN DRIER SITES, SOME RECOVERY HAD STARTED IN 10 YEARS.

IN ORDER TO RELATE HYDROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS TO KEY EROSION PROCESSES IN HEADWATER PEATLANDS DRAINED FOR FORESTRY, A TWO-YEAR STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN A NESTED SUB-CATCHMENT SYSTEM (TREATED WITH DITCH CLEANING) AND AT TWO REFERENCE SITES. THE TREATED CATCHMENT WAS INSTRUMENTED FOR CONTINUOUS DISCHARGE AND TURBIDITY MONITORING, EROSION PIN MEASUREMENTS OF CHANGES IN DITCH BED AND BANKS AND TIME-INTEGRATED SAMPLING OF SUSPENDED SEDIMENT (SS) COMPOSITION.

THE RESULTS OF OUR STUDY REVEAL THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE NITRATE RETENTION EFFICIENCY OF ORGANIC SOILS (53 +/- 28%; MEAN +/- SD) IS ONLY SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF MINERAL SOILS (50 +/- 32%).

THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF REVEGETATION STRATEGIES AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS ON THE FEN GHG EMISSIONS OVER THE GROWING SEASON. RELATIVE TO A NATURAL FEN, OUR RESULTS SHOW SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER FLUXES OF CH4 (P < 0.001), WHICH CORRELATE WITH HIGHER BULK DENSITY, LOWER ORGANIC MATTER CONTENT, AND HIGHER PH AND SO42- CONCENTRATION IN THE CONSTRUCTED FEN.

THIS PAPER REPORTS THE FINDINGS FROM A TEN-YEAR EXPERIMENT IN THE UK TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RESTORATION TREATMENTS ON WATER TABLE DEPTH, PEAT BULK DENSITY AND WATER CONTENT, GROUND SURFACE HEIGHT AND VEGETATION DEVELOPMENT. TREATMENTS USED WERE THE SIX COMBINATIONS OF DAMMING OR NOT DAMMING PLOUGH FURROWS WITH LEAVING THE TREES ALIVE, FELLING AND LEAVING THEM ON THE GROUND OR FELLING AND REMOVING THEM. COMBINING FELLING WITH DAMMING FURROWS WAS MOST SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING THE WATER TABLE, WHETHER OR NOT THE FELLED TREES WERE REMOVED. ONLY WHERE FELLING WAS COMBINED WITH DAMMING DID THE WATER TABLE CONTINUE TO RECOVER BETWEEN YEARS 5 AND 10. OVER TEN YEARS, THE WATER LEVEL IN THESE TREATMENTS ROSE TO SLIGHTLY BELOW THAT OF NON-AFFORESTED REFERENCE BOG AT THE SAME SITES. THIS OCCURRED AS A RAPID INITIAL RISE, FOLLOWING WHICH THERE WAS ONLY VERY SLIGHT FURTHER IMPROVEMENT. FELLING CAUSED THE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF THE VEGETATION TO CHANGE TOWARDS THAT OF THE REFERENCE BOGS. THE PROCESS WAS SLOW, WITH THE VEGETATION BECOMING MORE DISSIMILAR TO NON-FORESTED REFERENCE BOG IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS AND THEN BECOMING MORE SIMILAR TO THE REFERENCE BOG AFTER YEAR 5. SURPRISINGLY, DAMMING PLOUGH FURROWS HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON THE VEGETATION EXCEPT THAT, IN COMBINATION WITH FELLING, IT INCREASED DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE PLOUGH FURROWS AND OTHER POSITIONS ON THE PLOUGHED GROUND. CONIFER SEEDLINGS ESTABLISHED ON THE RESTORED PLOTS, MOST DENSELY WHERE THEY ADJOINED STANDING FOREST, AND HAD SIMILAR DENSITY AND GROWTH IN ALL THE FELLED TREATMENTS. THE RESTORATION TREATMENTS RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN BULK DENSITY AND INCREASE IN WATER CONTENT OF THE UPPER PEAT, PROBABLY DUE TO AN UNLOADING EFFECT CAUSED BY THE RAISED WATER TABLE BUOYING UP THE DRAINED PEAT LAYER. IN SOME TREATMENTS THIS WAS AMPLIFIED BY REMOVAL OF THE WEIGHT OF THE TREES. DAMMING THE PLOUGH FURROWS CAUSED A 5-7 CM RISE IN GROUND SURFACE HEIGHT, SUGGESTING THAT SUBSIDENCE RESULTING FROM PRIMARY CONSOLIDATION AND SECONDARY COMPRESSION IS AT LEAST PARTLY REVERSIBLE.","TEN-YEAR RESULTS OF A COMPARISON OF METHODS FOR RESTORING AFFORESTED BLANKET BOG","MIRES AND PEAT","ARTICLE",NA,2017,"10.19189/MaP.2015.OMB.214","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000397047800006"

HERE, WE DESCRIBE A NEW METHOD FOR THE FIELD COLLECTION OF CO2 SAMPLES FROM LOW-PH WATERS (PH<7) FOR RADIOCARBON ANALYSIS, WHICH INVOLVES A SCALED-UP VERSION OF THE WIDELY USED HEADSPACE EQUILIBRATION TECHNIQUE COUPLED WITH SYRINGE INJECTION OF SAMPLES INTO MOLECULAR SIEVE TRAPS FOR CONVENIENT AND STABLE STORAGE. WE PRESENT THE RESULTS OF LABORATORY AND FIELD TESTS TO VERIFY THIS 'SUPER HEADSPACE METHOD' AND DISCUSS ITS ADVANTAGES COMPARED WITH EXISTING TECHNIQUES, PARTICULARLY FOR SAMPLING IN REMOTE LOCATIONS. THIS INCLUDES ITS HIGH PORTABILITY, SPEED OF USE AND ABSENCE OF ANY SPECIAL SAMPLE PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS.

CLIMATE AND LAND MANAGEMENT CHANGE ARE THOUGHT TO BE IMPORTANT INFLUENCES ON RATES OF PEAT EROSION. HOWEVER, SEDIMENT PRODUCTION IN PEATLANDS IS DIFFERENT TO THAT OF OTHER SOILS AND NO MODELS OF EROSION SPECIFICALLY FOR PEATLANDS CURRENTLY EXIST. HENCE, FORECASTING THE INFLUENCE OF FUTURE CLIMATE OR SPATIALLY-DISTRIBUTED MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS ON PEAT EROSION IS DIFFICULT. THE PESERA-GRID MODEL WAS SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIED IN THIS STUDY TO INCLUDE DOMINANT BLANKET PEAT EROSION PROCESSES. IN THE RESULTING FLUVIAL EROSION MODEL, PESERA-PEAT, FREEZE-THAW AND DESICCATION PROCESSES WERE ACCOUNTED FOR BY A NOVEL SEDIMENT SUPPLY INDEX AS KEY FEATURES OF EROSION. LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WERE PARAMETERIZED FOR THEIR INFLUENCE ON VEGETATION COVER, BIOMASS AND SOIL MOISTURE CONDITION. PESERA-PEAT WAS NUMERICALLY EVALUATED USING AVAILABLE FIELD DATA FROM FOUR BLANKET PEAT-COVERED CATCHMENTS WITH DIFFERENT EROSION CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT INTENSITY. PESERA-PEAT WAS FOUND TO BE ROBUST IN MODELLING FLUVIAL EROSION IN BLANKET PEAT. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF PESERA-PEAT SHOWED THAT MODELLED SEDIMENT YIELD WAS MORE SENSITIVE TO VEGETATION COVER THAN OTHER TESTED FACTORS SUCH AS PRECIPITATION, TEMPERATURE, DRAINAGE DENSITY AND DITCH/GULLY DEPTH. TWO VERSIONS OF PESERA-PEAT, EQUILIBRIUM AND TIME-SERIES, PRODUCED SIMILAR RESULTS UNDER THE SAME ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, FACILITATING THE USE OF THE MODEL AT DIFFERENT SCALES. THE EQUILIBRIUM MODEL IS SUITABLE FOR ASSESSING THE HIGH-RESOLUTION SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF AVERAGE MONTHLY PEAT EROSION OVER THE STUDY PERIOD ACROSS LARGE AREAS (NATIONAL OR GLOBAL ASSESSMENTS), WHILE THE TIME-SERIES MODEL IS APPROPRIATE FOR INVESTIGATING CONTINUOUS MONTHLY PEAT EROSION THROUGHOUT STUDY PERIODS ACROSS SMALLER AREAS OR LARGE REGIONS USING A COARSER-SPATIAL RESOLUTION. PESERA-PEAT WILL THEREFORE SUPPORT FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND MANAGEMENT OPTIONS ON BLANKET PEAT EROSION AT VARIOUS SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES.

THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR PERMAFROST-AFFECTED BOREAL AND SUBARCTIC TERRITORIES, SUBJECTED TO STRONG MODIFICATION DUE TO PERMAFROST THAW AND LANDSCAPE CHANGES UNDER CLIMATE WARMING. WE SELECTED EARTH'S LARGEST FROZEN PEATLAND ZONE, THE WESTERN SIBERIA LOWLAND (WSL) IN ORDER TO TEST AN IMPACT OF CLIMATE WARMING, PERMAFROST THAW AND LANDSCAPE ZONE CHANGES ON RIVERINE TRANSPORT OF PARTICULATE MATERIAL FROM MAINLAND TO THE ARCTIC OCEAN. WE SAMPLED 33 SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE WSL RIVERS DURING SPRING FLOOD, SUMMER BASEFLOW AND AUTUMN FLOOD OVER A 1700 KM GRADIENT OF CLIMATE AND PERMAFROST. MAJOR AND TRACE ELEMENTS IN PARTICULATE (>0.45 MU M) AND DISSOLVED (<0.45 MU M) FRACTION WERE ANALYZED. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT FUTURE INCREASE IN ACTIVE LAYER THICKNESS AND THE CHANGE OF DOMINANT LANDSCAPE FROM BOGS AND LAKES TO FOREST CAN BE PREDICTED VIA ANALYZING THE ACTUAL PATTERN OF RSM CHEMICAL COMPOSITION ACROSS VARIOUS PERMAFROST ZONES AND LANDSCAPE PARAMETERS OF WSL RIVER WATERSHED. WE OBSERVED A MINIMUM CONCENTRATION OF LI, MG, NA, K, RB, V, CR, ZN, CU, CO, NI, AL, GA, Y, REES, NB, W, TI, ZR, HF, TH AND U IN RSM COLLECTED FROM ISOLATED AND SPORADIC PERMAFROST ZONES. CONSIDERING ALL SEASONS TOGETHER, THE PRESENCE OF FOREST IN THE PERMAFROST-BEARING ZONE INCREASED PARTICULATE CONCENTRATIONS OF ALL ALKALIS AND ALKALINE-EARTH ELEMENTS, B, AS, NB, MN, CO, AL, GA, REES, TI, ZR, HF, TH. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH ELEMENT MOBILIZATION FROM MINERAL HORIZONS THAT BECOME AVAILABLE FOR INTERACTING WITH SOIL FLUIDS UNDER FORESTED REGIONS. LAKES RETAINED PARTICULATE ALKALINE-EARTHS, FE, MN, CO, TRIVALENT AND TETRAVALENT HYDROLYSATES (TE3+, TE4+). THE CONCENTRATION OF LITHOGENIC LOW-SOLUBLE ELEMENTS (TE3+, TE4+) IN THE RSM STRONGLY INCREASED WITH THE RIVER SIZE (WATERSHED AREA). COMPARED TO THE WORLD RSM AVERAGE, THE WSL RIVERS EXHIBITED LOWER CONCENTRATIONS OF ALL ELEMENTS EXCEPT MN AND P AND A LOW SHARE OF SUSPENDED ELEMENTS RELATIVE TO TOTAL (SUSPENDED + DISSOLVED) FORMS OF TRACE METALS AND OF LOW-MOBILITY (LITHOGENIC) ELEMENTS. LIKELY REASONS FOR THESE FEATURES ARE: (I) LOW RUNOFF AND LOW RSM CONCENTRATION AS THERE IS NO ROCK AND MINERAL SUBSTRATE EXPOSED TO PHYSICAL WEATHERING IN WSL PEATLAND; (II) ORGANIC, RATHER THAN MINERAL, NATURE OF SURROUNDING ""SOLID"" SUBSTRATES AND AS A RESULT, ORGANIC RATHER THAN SILICATE NATURE OF RSM, AND (III) HIGH DOC AND FE CONCENTRATION LEADING TO HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF TYPICALLY LOW-SOLUBILTY ELEMENTS IN THE DISSOLVED (<0.45 MU M) FRACTION DUE TO COLLOIDS. FROM A CLIMATE WARMING PERSPECTIVE, THE INCREASE IN ACTIVE LAYER THICKNESS AND INVOLVEMENT OF MINERAL HORIZONS INTO SOIL FLUID MIGRATION IN DISCONTINUOUS TO CONTINUOUS PERMAFROST ZONE WILL LIKELY INCREASE THE SHARE OF PARTICULATE FRACTION IN TOTAL ELEMENT TRANSPORT FOR MANY SOLUBLE (LABILE) ELEMENTS AND ALSO LITHOGENIC ELEMENTS IN WSL RIVERS. AT THE SAME TIME, PERMAFROST BOUNDARY SHIFT NORTHWARD MAY DECREASE PARTICULATE CONCENTRATIONS OF MOST MAJOR AND TE IN RIVERS OF DISCONTINUOUS PERMAFROST ZONE. THE LAKE DRAINAGE AND FOREST COLONIZATION OF TUNDRA AND BOGS IN THE PERMAFROST-AFFECTED PART OF WSL MAY INCREASE THE CONCENTRATION OF ALKALI AND ALKALINE-EARTH ELEMENTS, DIVALENT METALS AND TRIVALENT AND TETRAVALENT HYDROLYSATES. AS A RESULT, EXPORT OF PARTICULATE METAL MICRONUTRIENTS AND TOXICANTS FROM THE WSL TERRITORY TO THE ARCTIC OCEAN MAY INCREASE. (C) 2019 ELSEVIER LTD.

WE CONDUCTED A FIELD IN SITU DRAINAGE EXPERIMENT CONSISTING OF LOW (PLOTS SURROUNDED BY 50 CM DEEP DITCHES), INTERMEDIATE (20 CM DEEP) AND HIGH (INTACT) WATER TABLE LEVELS. THE EXPERIMENT LASTED FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS, DURING WHICH WE MEASURED SCE RATE AND ASSOCIATED VARIABLES INCLUDING SOIL TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE WITH A HIGHER FREQUENCY IN THE GROWING SEASON (MAY-SEPTEMBER) THAN THE NON-GROWING SEASON (OCTOBER-APRIL). EXPERIMENTAL DRAINAGE DECREASED WATER TABLE HEIGHT BY CA. 12 CM AND 15 CM (RELATIVE TO THE INTACT) AND SOIL MOISTURE (AT 5 CM SOIL) BY 6% AND 12% (RELATIVE TO 45% IN THE INTACT) ON AVERAGE IN INTERMEDIATE AND LOW WATER TABLE TREATMENTS, RESPECTIVELY, BUT IT DID NOT AFFECT SOIL TEMPERATURE DURING THE EXPERIMENTAL YEARS. THE EFFECT OF DRAINAGE ON SCE VARIED WITH SEASON. IN THE NON-GROWING SEASON, THE DRAINAGE EFFECT WAS NONSIGNIFICANT IN EACH MEASUREMENT POSSIBLY BECAUSE THE LOW-TEMPERATURE EFFECT OVERRODE THE DRAINAGE EFFECT ON SCE. IN THE GROWING SEASON, THE DRAINAGE MOSTLY INCREASED THE EMISSION EXCEPT FOR SEVERAL CASES, IN WHICH A NEGATIVE EFFECT WAS OBSERVED. THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF DRAINAGE COULD BE DUE TO THE LOW SOIL MOISTURE (< 25%) IN THE DRAINED TREATMENTS. PROVIDED THAT THE MAGNITUDE AND THE DURATION OF THE SCE INCREASE WERE GREATER THAN THOSE OF THE DECREASE, IT CAN BE ESTIMATED THAT DRAINAGE INCREASED SCE BY 17% AND 20% ON AVERAGE IN THE LOW AND THE INTERMEDIATE WATER TABLE TREATMENTS, RESPECTIVELY, OVER THE EXPERIMENTAL YEARS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WATER TABLE DECLINE MAY FACILITATE NET CARBON EMISSION AND HENCE DECREASE SOIL CARBON STORAGE IN THE ZOIGE PEATLAND.

THESE HARVESTINGS REMOVE BRANCHES, NEEDLES, AND STUMP/ROOT SYSTEMS THAT WOULD EARLIER HAVE REMAINED ONSITE. HOWEVER, IN DRAINED PEATLAND FORESTS, SOME KEY GROWTH-LIMITING NUTRIENTS, SUCH AS POTASSIUM (K) AND BORON (B), ARE LARGELY STORED IN THE LIVING TREE BIOMASS, WHILE THE STORES IN PEAT IN TREE ROOTING LAYER ARE SMALL. A CONCERN HAS THUS BEEN RAISED THAT BIOENERGY HARVESTING MAY INDUCE NUTRIENT INSUFFICIENCY AND DECREASE SECOND ROTATION FOREST PRODUCTIVITY. WE STUDIED THE EFFECT OF WHOLE-TREE AND STUMP HARVESTING ON SITE NITROGEN (N), PHOSPHORUS (P), K, AND B CAPITALS IN FINAL HARVESTING OF A WELL-PRODUCTIVE, NORWAY SPRUCE-DOMINATED PEATLAND FOREST.

TO DATE WE HAVE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THESE INTERVENTIONS INFLUENCE THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES IN PEATLANDS. WE COMPARED THE RESPONSES OF DOMINANT MICROBIAL CONSUMERS (TESTATE AMOEBAE) TO DRAINAGE DITCH RESTORATION RELATIVE TO UNBLOCKED DITCHES IN A UK UPLAND BLANKET PEATLAND (MIGNEINT, NORTH WALES). TWO TECHNIQUES WERE USED FOR RESTORATION: (I) DAMMED DITCHES WITH RE-PROFILING; AND (II) DAMMED DITCHES WITH POOLS OF OPEN WATER BEHIND EACH DAM. TESTATE COMMUNITIES IN THE INTER-DITCH AREAS CHANGED MARKEDLY OVER TIME AND BETWEEN TREATMENTS ILLUSTRATING THE POTENTIAL OF THIS GROUP OF ORGANISMS AS INDICATORS OF BLANKET PEATLAND RESTORATION STATUS. HOWEVER, THE RESPONSES OF TESTATE AMOEBAE TO PEAT REWETTING ASSOCIATED WITH RESTORATION WERE PARTIALLY OBSCURED BY INTER-ANNUAL VARIABILITY IN WEATHER CONDITIONS THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE EXPERIMENT. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE VARIABILITY IN THE RESPONSE OF TESTATE AMOEBAE COMMUNITIES TO PEATLAND DRAIN BLOCKING, THERE WERE CLEARLY MORE PRONOUNCED CHANGES IN SAMPLES FROM THE DAMMED AND REPROFILED TREATMENTS INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN DIVERSITY, AND THE APPEARANCE OF UNAMBIGUOUS WET-INDICATOR SPECIES IN RELATIVELY HIGH ABUNDANCES (INCLUDINGAMPHITREMA STENOSTOMA, ARCHERELLA FLAVUM, ARCELLA DISCOIDES TYPE, DIFFLUGIA BACILLIFERA AND DIFFLUGIA BACILLARIUM). THIS REFLECTS A SHIFT TOWARDS OVERALL WETTER CONDITIONS ACROSS THE SITE AND THE CREATION OF NEW HABITATS. HOWEVER, WATER-TABLE WAS NOT A SIGNIFICANT CONTROL ON TESTATE AMOEBAE IN THIS CASE, SUGGESTING A POOR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WATER TABLE AND SURFACE MOISTURE IN THIS SLOPING BLANKET PEATLAND.

WE ALSO EVALUATED THE CONCEPTUAL IDEA THAT COMPARING REFERENCE ECOSYSTEMS IN TERMS OF THEIR COMPOSITIONAL SIMILARITY TO NULL ASSEMBLAGES (AND THUS THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF STOCHASTIC VERSUS DETERMINISTIC ASSEMBLY) CAN GUIDE EVALUATIONS OF RESTORATION SUCCESS BETTER THAN ANALYSES OF COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OR DIVERSITY. COMMUNITY COMPOSITION DATA HIGHLIGHTED SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE MACRO INVERTEBRATE COMPOSITION OF RESTORED POOLS COMPARED TO UNDISTURBED PEATLAND POOLS, WHICH COULD BE USED TO SUGGEST THAT ALTERNATIVE END-POINTS TO RESTORATION WERE INFLUENCED BY STOCHASTIC PROCESSES. HOWEVER, WIDELY USED DIVERSITY METRICS INDICATED NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UNDISTURBED AND RESTORED POOLS. NOVEL EVALUATIONS OF RESTORATION USING NULL MODELS CONFIRMED THE SIMILARITY OF DETERMINISTIC ASSEMBLY PROCESSES FROM THE NATIONAL SPECIES POOL ACROSS ALL POOLS. STOCHASTIC ELEMENTS WERE IMPORTANT DRIVERS OF BETWEEN-POOL DIFFERENCES AT THE REGIONAL-SCALE BUT THE SCALE OF THESE EFFECTS WAS ALSO SIMILAR ACROSS MOST OF THE POOLS STUDIED.

THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SELECTED CLIMATE, SNOW, AND CATCHMENT CHARACTERISTICS AND CALCULATED STORAGE PROPERTIES AND LOW FLOWS WERE INVESTIGATED, IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT RENDER CATCHMENTS VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. WE FOUND THAT THE MOST SENSITIVE AREAS TO CLIMATE CHANGE WERE LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN BOREAL COASTAL ZONE, WITH FINE-GRAINED SOILS AND AGRICULTURAL AREAS. IN CONTRAST, CATCHMENTS IN THE MIDDLE AND NORTHERN BOREAL ZONE, WITH TILL AND PEATLAND SOILS AND HIGHER SNOW WATER EQUIVALENT VALUES, WERE LESS SENSITIVE UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, WE FOUND A THRESHOLD AT A SNOW TO PRECIPITATION RATIO OF 0.35. ABOVE THAT THRESHOLD, SUMMER LOW FLOWS WERE GENERALLY SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN SNOW CONDITIONS, WHEREAS BELOW THAT THRESHOLD CATCHMENT CHARACTERISTICS GAINED IMPORTANCE AND THE SENSITIVITY WAS MORE DIRECTLY RELATED TO CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE AND TIMING OF RAINFALL.

HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC C (DOC) RELATIVE TO GASEOUS FLUXES OF CO2 AND CH4 IN THE C BALANCE OF THESE ECOSYSTEMS HAS NOT OFTEN BEEN STUDIED. DISSOLVED C FLUXES ARE IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING C PARTITIONING WITHIN THE PEATLAND AND THE POTENTIAL C DRAINAGE FROM IT. THIS RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED IN BURNS BOG, A HEAVILY IMPACTED ECOSYSTEM NEAR VANCOUVER, CANADA, UNDERGOING ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION EFFORTS BY REWETTING. HERE WE PRESENT DATA ON (I) ECOSYSTEM-SCALE FLUXES OF CO2 (NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE, NEE) AND CH4 (FCH4) DETERMINED BY EDDY COVARIANCE, (II) EVASION FLUXES OF CO2 AND CH4 FROM THE WATER SURFACE TO ESTIMATE THE ROLE OF OPEN WATER IN ECOSYSTEM-SCALE FLUXES, AND (III) DOC FLUX (FDOC) IN WATER DRAINING FROM THE PEATLAND. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT OPEN WATER AREAS INSIDE THE FOOTPRINT WERE A CONTINUAL C SOURCE, EMITTING 47.0 +/- 2.4 G C.M(-2).YEAR(-1). DOC EXPORT (15.6 G C.M(-2).YEAR(-1)) WAS SIGNIFICANT TO THE NET ECOSYSTEM C BALANCE, DECREASING THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EDDY COVARIANCE-DETERMINED C BALANCE (I.E., NEE + FCH4) OF -45.0 +/- 16.8 G C.M(-2).YEAR(-1) BY 35%, RESULTING IN A NET ECOSYSTEM C BALANCE (I.E., NEE + FCH4 + FDOC) OF-29.7 +/- 17.0 G C.M(-2).YEAR(-1).

FROM THESE DATA, WE ESTIMATED THE AMOUNT OF CARBON ENTERING AND LEAVING THE ECOSYSTEM. WE FOUND THAT OPEN WATER AREAS CONTINUALLY EMIT CARBON TO THE ATMOSPHERE, BUT THE ECOSYSTEM AS A WHOLE IS ACCUMULATING CARBON ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.

HIS FIRST PAPERS IN 1908 CONCERNED UNCONFINED FLOW OF WATER IN SATURATED SOIL, ARISING IN THE DESIGN OF REQUIRED DITCH SPACING FOR DRAINING PEAT. HE DEVELOPED AND USED A GRAPHICAL METHOD TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. THIS AND OTHER PRACTICAL PROBLEMS STIMULATED HIS INTEREST IN NUMERICAL METHODS AND SOON LED HIM TO THE CHALLENGE OF NUMERICAL WEATHER PREDICTION. IN 1922 HE PUBLISHED THE BOOK WEATHER PREDICTION BY NUMERICAL PROCESS. HE DID THE RESEARCH FOR THIS BOOK UNDER DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES JUST BEFORE, DURING, AND RIGHT AFTER WORLD WAR I. THE BOOK WAS RECEIVED POSITIVELY, BUT METHODS LIKE THOSE PROPOSED IN IT WERE NOT SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED UNTIL THE INVENTION OF FAST DIGITAL COMPUTERS AROUND 1950. POSTHUMOUSLY, MOST OF RICHARDSON'S CONTRIBUTIONS IN VARIOUS FIELDS RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION. IMPORTANT EXCEPTIONS ARE HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOIL SCIENCE AND HYDROLOGY, ON WHICH WE FOCUS IN THIS PAPER. IN HIS 1922 BOOK, RICHARDSON FORMULATED AN ELABORATE MODEL FOR TRANSPORT PROCESSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE. FOR THE LOWER BOUNDARY OF HIS ATMOSPHERIC MODEL, HE NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE MOVEMENT OF LIQUID WATER, WATER VAPOR, AND HEAT IN THE UPPER LAYER OF THE SOIL, AND AT THE SOIL-ATMOSPHERE AND PLANT-ATMOSPHERE INTERFACES. FINDING LITTLE PREVIOUS WORK ON THIS, HE FIRST OF ALL FORMULATED THE PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION FOR TRANSIENT, VERTICAL FLOW OF LIQUID WATER IN SOIL. WE ARGUE THAT THE RESULTING EQUATION CAN RIGHTLY BE CALLED THE RICHARDSON-RICHARDS EQUATION. IN ADDITION HE FORMULATED EQUATIONS FOR SIMULTANEOUS TRANSFER OF LIQUID WATER AND WATER VAPOR, FOR TRANSFER OF HEAT IN SOIL, AND FOR THE BALANCES OF WATER AND ENERGY AT THE SOIL-ATMOSPHERE AND PLANT-ATMOSPHERE INTERFACES. FINITE DIFFERENCE VERSIONS OF ALL THE EQUATIONS WERE INCORPORATED IN THE NUMERICAL WEATHER FORECASTING MODEL.

THE RATIO OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON TO ORGANIC NITROGEN (C-ORG/N-ORG) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE ORGANIC-POOR LAKE, REFLECTING A STRONG IMPACT OF AUTOCHTHONOUS N-ORG PRODUCTION AND N DIFFUSION FROM THE SEDIMENT TO THE WATER COLUMN. THERE WAS A CLEAR DIFFERENCE IN THE VERTICAL PATTERN OF THE PROPORTION OF THE LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT (LMW < 1 KDA) ORGANIC CARBON (OC) BETWEEN THE HUMIC AND THE ORGANIC-POOR LAKES. REGARDLESS OF SEASON, THE ORGANIC-POOR LAKE'S LMW < 1 KDA WAS 40%-90%, WHEREAS THAT OF THE ORGANIC-RICH LAKE 20%-30%. THIS DIFFERENCE WAS MOST LIKELY LINKED TO THE DOMINANCE OF PEAT SOIL AND BOG PROVIDING ALLOCHTHONOUS OC TO THE ORGANIC-RICH LAKE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, AND POSSIBLE PRODUCTION OF LMW AUTOCHTHONOUS ORGANIC LIGANDS BY PHYTOPLANKTON AND PHOTODEGRADATION IN THE ORGANIC-POOR LAKE. THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF ALLOCHTHONOUS ORGANIC MATTER (OM) IN THE COLOR PROPERTIES OF THE LAKE WATER WAS CONFIRMED BY THE LIGHT ABSORBANCE IN THE VISUAL RANGE AND SPECIFIC ULTRAVIOLET ABSORPTION MEASUREMENTS.

TUNDRA WILDFIRE COULD ALTER TERRESTRIAL SILICA (SIO2) CYCLING BY RESTRUCTURING SURFACE VEGETATION AND BY DEEPENING THE SEASONALLY THAWED ACTIVE LAYER. THESE CHANGES COULD INFLUENCE THE AVAILABILITY OF SILICA IN TERRESTRIAL PERMAFROST ECOSYSTEMS AND ALTER LATERAL EXPORTS TO DOWNSTREAM MARINE WATERS, WHERE SILICA IS OFTEN A LIMITING NUTRIENT. IN THIS CONTEXT, WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF THE LARGEST ARCTIC TUNDRA FIRE IN RECENT TIMES ON PLANT AND PEAT AMORPHOUS SILICA CONTENT AND DISSOLVED SILICA CONCENTRATION IN STREAMS. TEN YEARS AFTER THE FIRE, VEGETATION IN BURNED AREAS HAD 73% MORE SILICA IN ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS COMPARED TO ADJACENT, UNBURNED AREAS. THIS INCREASE IN PLANT SILICA WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PLANT SILICA CONCENTRATION IN BRYOPHYTES AND INCREASED PREVALENCE OF SILICA-RICH GRAMMINOIDS IN BURNED AREAS. TUNDRA FIRE REDISTRIBUTED PEAT SILICA, WITH BURNED AREAS CONTAINING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AMORPHOUS SILICA CONCENTRATIONS IN THE O-LAYER, BUT 29% LESS SILICA IN PEAT OVERALL DUE TO SHALLOWER PEAT DEPTH POST BURN. DESPITE THESE DRAMATIC DIFFERENCES IN TERRESTRIAL SILICA DYNAMICS, DISSOLVED SILICA CONCENTRATION IN TRIBUTARIES DRAINING BURNED CATCHMENTS DID NOT DIFFER FROM UNBURNED CATCHMENTS, POTENTIALLY DUE TO THE INCREASED UPTAKE BY TERRESTRIAL VEGETATION. TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TUNDRA WILDFIRE ENHANCES TERRESTRIAL AVAILABILITY OF SILICA VIA PERMAFROST DEGRADATION AND ASSOCIATED WEATHERING, BUT THAT CHANGES IN LATERAL SILICA EXPORT MAY DEPEND ON VEGETATION UPTAKE DURING THE FIRST DECADE OF POSTWILDFIRE SUCCESSION. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE ARCTIC IS LEADING TO MORE FREQUENT AND SEVERE WILDFIRE IN ARCTIC TUNDRA ECOSYSTEMS. STUDYING THE SILICA (SIO2) CYCLE IN ARCTIC ECOSYSTEMS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF SILICA EXPORTED FROM LAND TO SEA CAN CONTROL UPTAKE BY MARINE PRIMARY PRODUCERS IN ARCTIC COASTAL WATERS. WE INVESTIGATED HOW TUNDRA WILDFIRE AFFECTS SILICA CYCLING BY RETURNING TO A LARGE ARCTIC WILDFIRE 10 YEARS AFTER THE BURN TO COLLECT SAMPLES OF STREAM WATER, VEGETATION, AND PEAT. WE FOUND THAT PLANTS GROWING ON BURNED LANDSCAPES CONTAINED 73% MORE SILICA IN THEIR ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS COMPARED TO UNBURNED AREAS NEARBY. WHILE THE FIRE THAWED PERMAFROST UNDERNEATH IT, WE DID NOT OBSERVE INCREASED LEVELS OF SILICA IN STREAMS DRAINING BURNED AREAS. THIS PATTERN INDICATES THAT ELEVATED RATES OF SILICA UPTAKE VIA PLANTS MAY PREVENT INCREASED SILICA EXPORT TO MARINE WATERS FOLLOWING TUNDRA WILDFIRE. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE EFFECT OF TUNDRA FIRE ON SILICA CYCLING DEPENDS ON THE RECOVERY TRAJECTORIES OF TERRESTRIAL AND AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS IN THE ARCTIC.

FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE DIVIDED 1 M PEAT CORES SAMPLED AT THE NINE SITES INTO 4 CM SECTIONS AND ANALYSED THESE PEAT SAMPLES FOR BULK DENSITY, LOSS ON IGNITION, PH VALUE, CARBON AND NITROGEN CONTENT AND RATIO, STABLE CARBON AND NITROGEN ISOTOPE SIGNATURES, AND FIVE HUMIFICATION INDICES BASED ON FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY. BESIDES, WE REGULARLY MEASURED WATER LEVELS AND INCUBATED LITTER BAGS OVER TWO YEARS. PEAT CHARACTERISTICS WERE FOUND TO BE RELATIVELY HOMOGENOUS ACROSS THE TREELESS AND ONLY SLIGHTLY DEGRADED SITES.

WE FOUND THAT THE CONCENTRATIONS INCREASED WITH TEMPERATURE SUM (TS), I.E. FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. NITROGEN, P AND TOC CONCENTRATIONS INCREASED WITH THE PROPORTION OF DRAINED AREAS IN THE CATCHMENT; THOSE OF N AND TOC ALSO INCREASED WITH THE PROPORTION OF PEATLANDS. IN CONTRAST, WITH THE INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS OF N AND TOC WITH TIME, P CONCENTRATIONS SHOWED A DECREASING TREND OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES. ACCORDING TO OUR ESTIMATES, ALTOGETHER 47,300 MG OF N, 1780 MG OF P AND 1814 GG OF TOC IS TRANSPORTED FROM FOREST AREAS TO SURFACE WATERS IN FINLAND. FOREST MANAGEMENT CONTRIBUTES 17% OF THE N EXPORT, 35% OF THE P EXPORT AND 12% OF THE TOC EXPORT. OUR NEW FOREST MANAGEMENT EXPORT ESTIMATES FOR N AND P ARE MORE THAN TWO TIMES HIGHER THAN THE OLD ESTIMATES USED BY THE ENVIRONMENT AUTHORITIES.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION THE POTENTIAL FOR METHANE PRODUCTION WAS LOW IN THE INVESTIGATED SOIL PROFILE, EVEN IN CONSTANTLY FLOODED LAYERS BELOW THE WATER TABLE FLUCTUATIONS. DURING ANAEROBIC INCUBATIONS, THE HIGHEST ACCUMULATED CONCENTRATIONS AND PRODUCTION RATES OF METHANE WERE OBSERVED IN THE UPPER 10-CM LAYER AND THE LOWEST IN DEEPER SOIL LAYERS, INDICATING THAT PLANT EXUDATES ARE THE MAIN SOURCE OF ENERGY FOR HETEROTROPHIC SOIL MICROBES AND THAT METHANOGENESIS IN DEEPER LAYERS IS LIMITED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE ORGANIC SUBSTRATES.

THREE YEARS AFTER FERTILIZATION WITH ASHES THE CONTENT OF PHOSPHORUS WAS UP TO 150 TIMES AND THAT OF POTASSIUM 23 TIMES HIGHER IN THE PEAT SUBSTRATE TREATED WITH ASHES THAN ON THE CONTROL PLOT. THE GROWTH AND BIOMASS FORMATION VARIED AMONG TREATMENTS AND DEPENDS STRONGLY ON THE CONTENT OF P AND K IN THE GROWTH SUBSTRATE.

POTENTIAL LIMITATION OF THESE PLANTS TO AREAS WITH LOW SULFATE WAS ANALYZED WITH A SPATIAL MATCH-UP OF TWO LARGE DATABASES. THE PEAT POLDERS ARE GENERALLY USED FOR DAIRY FARMING OR NATURE CONSERVATION, AND HAVE CONSIDERABLE AREAS OF SHALLOW SURFACE WATER (MEAN 16%, RANGE 6-43%). AS A CONSEQUENCE OF CONTINUOUS DRAINAGE, THE PEAT IN THESE POLDERS MINERALIZES CAUSING SUBSIDENCE RATES GENERALLY RANGING BETWEEN 2 AND 10 MM Y(-1). TOGETHER WITH PYRITE OXIDATION, THIS PEAT MINERALIZATION THE MOST IMPORTANT INTERNAL SOURCE OF SULFATE, PROVIDING AN ESTIMATED 96 KG SO4 HA(-1) MM(-1) SUBSIDENCE EXTERNAL SOURCES ARE PRECIPITATION AND WATER SUPPLIED DURING SUMMER TO COMPENSATE FOR WATER SHORTAGE, BUT THESE WERE FOUND TO BE MINOR COMPARED TO INTERNAL RELEASE. THE MOST IMPORTANT OUTPUT FLUX IS DISCHARGE OF EXCESS SURFACE WATER DURING AUTUMN AND WINTER. IF ONLY EXTERNAL FLUXES IN AND OUT OF A POLDER ARE EVALUATED, INPUTS AVERAGE 37 +/- 9 AND EXPORTS 169 +/- 17 KG S HA(-1) Y(-1). DURING SUMMER, WHEN EVAPOTRANSPIRATION EXCEEDS RAINFALL, SULFATE ACCUMULATES IN THE UNSATURATED ZONE, TO BE FLUSHED AWAY AND DRAINED OFF DURING THE WET AUTUMN AND WINTER. IN SOME POLDERS, UPWARD SEEPAGE FROM EARLY HOLOCENE, BRACKISH SEDIMENTS CAN BE A SOURCE OF SULFATE. PEAT POLDERS EXPORT SULFATE TO THE REGIONAL WATER SYSTEM AND THE SEA DURING WINTER DRAINAGE. THE AVAILABLE SULFATE PROBABLY ONLY PLAYS A MINOR ROLE IN THE OXIDATION OF PEAT: WE ESTIMATE THAT THIS IS LESS THAN 10% WHEREAS AEROBIC MINERALIZATION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. MOST SURFACE WATERS IN THESE POLDERS HAVE HIGH SULFATE CONCENTRATIONS, WHICH GENERALLY DECLINE DURING THE GROWING SEASON WHEN AQUATIC SEDIMENTS ARE A SINK.

METHODS: BRYOPHYTE SPECIES COMPOSITION, PEAK ABOVE-GROUND BIOMASS AND VASCULAR PLANT NUTRIENTS, AS WELL AS ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY OF VARIOUS LAYERS IN THE PEAT WERE MEASURED BETWEEN 1988 AND 2013. RESULTS: THE EUTROPHIC MOSS CALLIERGONELLA CUSPIDATA CLEARLY DECREASED IN AERIAL EXTENT OVER THE 25-YR STUDY, ESPECIALLY NEAR THE DITCH SUPPLYING BASE-RICH SURFACE WATER TO THE FEN.

THREE EXISTING MODELS FOR ESTIMATING THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF ORGANIC SOILS WERE ASSESSED FOR THEIR SUITABILITY FOR CULTIVATED DRAINED PEAT SOILS. THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF PEAT SAMPLES WITH THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF MINERAL MATTER CONTENT WAS DETERMINED, USING THE SINGLE PROBE METHOD, IN THE SATURATED STATE AND WHEN SUBJECTED TO AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT MATRIC POTENTIALS AT FIVE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES ( + 10 DEGREES C, + 1 DEGREES C, - 3 DEGREES C, - 5 DEGREES C AND -10 DEGREES C). THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT X VALUES DIFFERED BETWEEN PEAT SOILS DEPENDING ON MINERAL MATTER CONTENT, ICE CONTENT AND MOISTURE CONTENT. THE SAMPLES WITH THE HIGHEST MINERAL MATTER CONTENT AND BULK DENSITY HAD HIGHER THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY AT POSITIVE TEMPERATURES AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, AT FREEZING TEMPERATURES, WHEN VOLUMETRIC WATER CONTENT AND VOLUME OF WATER-FREE PORES WAS SIMILAR.

THE DOMINANT WETLAND SPECIES WERE COMMON REED, CATTAIL AND SEDGES. SRC PLANTATION WAS PLANTED ON DEGRADED SOILS. THE PRIME COST OF BIOMASS WHICH WAS PRODUCED ON THE BASE OF NATURAL GRASS WAS FROM 10.4 EURO PER TON TO 13.2 EURO PER TON, DEPENDING ON TECHNOLOGY. THE PRIME COST OF WILLOW BIOMASS WAS 24.1 EURO PER TON. INTRODUCTION OF TAXES WILL INCREASE COST OF BIOMASS BY APPROXIMATELY 60 %. THE CALCULATION OF ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY IDENTIFIED THAT BIOMASS AS A FEEDSTOCK FOR PELLET PRODUCTION ON POST-PEAT MINING AREAS MAY BE A PROFITABLE DIRECTION FOR PEAT FACTORY FUNCTION AND PROVIDING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. ADDITIONAL PROFIT MAY BE OBTAINED AS A RESULT OF SAVING CARBON QUOTAS. THE SHARE OF CO2 EMISSIONS FROM FOSSIL FUEL FOR GRASS BIOMASS PRODUCTION IS ABOUT 2 % FROM THE TOTAL VOLUME OF CO2 DURING RENEWABLE BIOMASS UTILIZATION FOR ENERGY AND FOR CHIPS PRODUCTION FROM WILLOW WOOD - 6 %. THE DIVERSIFICATION OF BIOMASS SOURCES ENABLES TO USE FEEDSTOCK FOR A PELLET LINE IN THE WINTER AND SPRING WHICH IS IN THE HEATING SEASON.","THE ASSESSMENT OF COST OF BIOMASS FROM POST-MINING PEATY LANDS FOR PELLET FABRICATION","ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE TECHNOLOGIES","ARTICLE","FEB",2018,"10.2478/rtuect-2018-0008","GREEN & SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY","WOS:000462518200006"

HOWEVER, RESTORATION OF DRAINED PEATLANDS HAS GAINED MUCH IMPORTANCE OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES, MOSTLY DUE TO THE MULTIPLE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THEY PROVIDE SUCH AS CARBON STORAGE, HABITAT PROVISION AND WATER FLOW REGULATION. ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASED FOCUS ON SUCH ECOSYSTEMS, SPATIAL RESEARCH ON HYDROPHYSICAL SOIL PROPERTIES FOLLOWING REWETTING IN COASTAL MIRES IS LACKING. THEREFORE, THE OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY WERE TO UNDERSTAND THE SPATIAL STRUCTURES OF HYDROPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ORGANIC SOILS AND SPATIAL PATTERNS OF ORGANIC MATTER ACCUMULATION IN RELATION TO SOIL SURFACE MICROTOPOGRAPHY. SOIL ORGANIC MATTER CONTENT (SOM) AND HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY (K-S) OF TOPSOILS (0-28 CM), ALONG WITH SOIL TEXTURES OF THE UNDERLYING MINERAL SUBSTRATE, WERE INVESTIGATED IN A REWETTED NON-TIDAL COASTAL FLOOD MIRE (BALTIC SEA). THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE ORGANIC HORIZON WITH ITS RELATIVELY LOW K-S ACTS AS A HYDROLOGICAL BARRIER TO INFILTRATION. SOIL ORGANIC MATTER CONTENT (SOM), K-S AND SOIL SURFACE MICROTOPOGRAPHY ARE ALL SPATIALLY AUTO-CORRELATED WITHIN 100, 87 AND 53 M, RESPECTIVELY. BIVARIATE MORAN'S I REVEALED A POSITIVE BUT WEAK SPATIAL CORRELATION BETWEEN SOM AND K-S AND A MODERATELY STRONG NEGATIVE SPATIAL CORRELATION BETWEEN SOM AND SOIL SURFACE MICROTOPOGRAPHY. A MAP OF SOM WAS GENERATED USING SIMPLE KRIGING, WHICH PREDICTS HIGHER SOM IN THE CENTRE OF THE ECOSYSTEM, AT LOWER ELEVATIONS; AND LOWER SOM AT THE EDGES OF THE STUDY AREA, AT HIGHER ELEVATIONS. LOCAL DEPRESSIONS IN THE CENTRE OF THE ECOSYSTEM PROVIDE A WETTER AND THEREFORE MORE ANAEROBIC ENVIRONMENT, THEREBY DECREASING CARBON MINERALISATION RATES AND ENABLING PEAT ACCUMULATION. THE LOW HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY OF THE DEGRADED PEAT IN THE PRESENCE OF LOWER MICRO-ELEVATIONS IN THE CENTRE OF THE ECOSYSTEM IS LIKELY TO INCREASE THE RESIDENCE TIME OF FLOODWATER AND THUS MAY ENHANCE (NEW) PEAT ACCUMULATION. THUS, WE CONCLUDE THAT, FOR THE RESTORATION OF NON-TIDAL COASTAL MIRES WHERE FLOODING EVENTS ARE NOT AS FREQUENT, K-S AND SOIL SURFACE MICROTOPOGRAPHY ARE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER THAN FOR TIDAL SYSTEMS.","SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY OF SOIL PROPERTIES IN RELATION TO MICROTOPOGRAPHY IN A NON-TIDAL REWETTED COASTAL MIRE","MIRES AND PEAT","ARTICLE",NA,2020,"10.19189/MaP.2019.GDC.StA.1779","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000517603000001"

IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT OF SUSTAINED LOWERING OF THE WATER TABLE ON PEATLAND CARBON DYNAMICS, WE RE-VISITED A DRAINAGE-AFFECTED BOG, REPEATING EDDY COVARIANCE MEASUREMENTS OF CO2 FLUX AFTER A 16-YEAR INTERVAL. WE FOUND THE ECOSYSTEM CO2 SINK TO HAVE STRENGTHENED ACROSS THE INTERVENING PERIOD, DESPITE A DEEP AND FLUCTUATING WATER TABLE. THIS WAS MOSTLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CO2 UPTAKE THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED SHRUB GROWTH. WE ALSO OBSERVED A DECLINE IN CO2 LOSS THROUGH ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION. THESE CHANGES COULD NOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. AIR TEMPERATURE WAS THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT CONTEMPORANEOUS DRIVER OF MONTHLY ANOMALIES IN CO2 FLUXES, WITH HIGHER TEMPERATURES DECREASING THE NET CO2 SINK VIA INCREASED ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION.

(AREA 1) AND FROM THE LIMNETIC REGION (AREA 2) OF A TROPICAL COASTAL LAGOON SEPARATED FROM THE SEA BY A SANDBAR. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT AREA 1 PRESENTS A PROPORTIONALLY SMALLER POTENTIAL METHANE PRODUCTION (PMP) ON SULPHATE ADDITION THAN AREA 2. WE FURTHER HYPOTHESIZED THAT ACETATE ADDITION STIMULATES PROPORTIONALLY GREATER PMP IN AREA 2 SEDIMENT LAYERS THAN IN AREA 1. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE PMP RATES WERE MEASURED IN SEDIMENT SAMPLES FROM THREE DEPTHS (0-2, 2-6, AND 6-10 CM) IN AREAS 1 AND 2 FOR 89 DAYS. THE SEDIMENT INCUBATIONS WERE PREPARED WITH ADDITIONS OF ACETATE (1 MM), SULPHATE (10 MM), AND ACETATE PLUS SULPHATE (1 AND 10 MM, RESPECTIVELY); THE CONTROL TREATMENT HAD NO ADDITION OF ACETATE AND/OR SULPHATE. WE ALSO MEASURED DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC), CARBOHYDRATES, AND SULPHATE IN THE INTERSTITIAL WATER. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: PMP RESPONDED DIFFERENTLY TO ACETATE AND SULPHATE ADDITION. IN GENERAL, PMP IN AREA 2 WAS PROPORTIONALLY MORE STIMULATED BY THE ADDITION OF ACETATE AND LESS INHIBITED BY THE ADDITION OF SULPHATE. IN THE 0-2-CM LAYER, THE ADDITION OF ACETATE DID NOT STIMULATE PMP IN RELATION TO THE CONTROL IN AREA 1, REACHING A RATE OF 376.11 NMOL CH4 G(-1) DAY(-1). IN AREA 2, PMP WAS 5-FOLD HIGHER IN RELATION TO THE CONTROL, REACHING 5.4 NMOL CH4 G(-1)DAY(-1). CONTRARILY, IN THE 6-10-CM LAYER, SULPHATE ADDITION INHIBITED PMP BY 127.8-FOLD IN RELATION TO THE CONTROL IN AREA 1, REACHING 0.6 NMOL CH4 G(-1) DAY(-1). IN AREA 2, PMP DECREASED 3.2-FOLD IN RELATION TO THE CONTROL, REACHING A VALUE OF 3.7 NMOL CH4 G(-1) DAY(-1). THESE RESULTS AGREED WITH THE HIGHER AMOUNTS OF CARBOHYDRATES AND LOWER AMOUNTS OF SULPHATE IN AREA 1 IN THE EXPERIMENT BEGINNING. CONCLUSIONS: ACETATE AND SULPHATE ARE EFFECTIVE PMP REGULATORS IN THE SEDIMENT OF TWO AREAS OF A TROPICAL COASTAL LAGOON. ACETATE INCREASED PMP MORE IN AREA 2, DUE TO THE LOWER SEDIMENT CARBON AVAILABILITY. IN CONTRAST, SULPHATE DECREASED PMP MORE IN AREA 1, DUE TO THE LOWER SULPHATE AVAILABILITY.

UNBURNED AREAS WERE DOMINATED BY HERBACEOUS PLANTS. WILLOWS PRESENT WERE SPARSE AND LOW, WITH CHLOROSES AND NECROSES. THEIR FOLIAR NUTRIENT CONTENT INDICATED STRONG K LIMITATION. MODERATELY BURNED AREAS WERE DOMINATED EITHER BY WILLOWS OR NITROPHILOUS PLANTS. WILLOWS IN MODERATELY BURNED AREAS HAD HIGH CHLOROPHYLL CONTENT IN LEAVES AND THEIR FOLIAR NUTRIENT CONTENT INDICATED A LACK OF EVIDENT NUTRIENT LIMITATION.

HERE WE COMBINE VEGETATION AND WATER LEVEL PROXIES TO ESTIMATE EMISSIONS, BY USING BIOINDICATION OF VEGETATION COMMUNITIES FOR WATER LEVEL TOGETHER WITH THE LINEAR CORRELATION BETWEEN ANNUAL MEAN WATER LEVEL AND GHG FLUXES. THIS APPROACH IS DEMONSTRATED IN THE DRENTSCHE AA BROOK VALLEY IN THE NETHERLANDS, WHERE PEATLANDS WERE REWETTED TO RESTORE RICH FEN VEGETATION. BIODIVERSITY OF THE LANDSCAPE WAS MONITORED BY REPEATED VEGETATION MAPPING BEFORE AND AFTER REWETTING, WHICH ENABLES THE ESTIMATION OF EMISSIONS REDUCTION AS A CO-BENEFIT. MEAN ANNUAL WATER LEVEL VALUES ARE ASSIGNED TO MAPPED VEGETATION TYPES USING EXISTING DATA ON WATER LEVEL DYNAMICS FROM MEASUREMENTS ON CORRESPONDING PLANT COMMUNITIES. GHG EMISSIONS ARE ESTIMATED USING LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS OF GAS FLUXES AGAINST MEAN ANNUAL WATER LEVELS. THIS APPROACH PROVIDES SPATIALLY EXPLICIT AND QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATION OF MEAN ANNUAL WATER LEVELS AND GHG FLUXES.

RELEVANT CHEMICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS WERE ANALYZED TO EXPLORE THE PRIMARY CONTROLLING FACTORS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT MOST OF THE RIVERS IN THE YRSR WERE NET CO2 SOURCE, WITH THE PCO(2) RANGING FROM 181 TO 2441 MU ATM AND THE FCO2 RANGING FROM -50 TO 1574 MMOL M(-2) D(-1). BOTH PCO(2) AND FCO2 SHOWED STRONG SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATIONS. THE HIGHEST AVERAGE FCO2 WAS OBSERVED IN AUGUST, WHILE THE LOWEST AVERAGE WAS OBSERVED IN JUNE. SPATIALLY, THE LOWEST FCO2 WERE OBSERVED IN THE PERMAFROST REGIONS WHILE THE HIGHEST FCO2 WERE OBSERVED IN PEATLAND. BY INTEGRATING SEASONAL CHANGES OF THE WATER SURFACE AREA, TOTAL CO2 EFFLUX WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 0.30 TG C YEAR(-1).

SECONDLY, WE SHOWED THAT SOIL COMMUNITIES ARE CONTROLLED BY A DISTINCT SET OF DRIVERS AT THE LOCAL, AS OPPOSED TO LANDSCAPE, SCALE. COMMUNITY STRUCTURE WAS FOUND TO BE MARKEDLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN AREAS, IN CONTRAST TO COMMUNITY FUNCTION WHICH SHOWED HIGH VARIABILITY WITHIN AREAS. WE FURTHER FOUND THAT MICROBIAL STRUCTURE APPEARS TO BE CONTROLLED MORE AT A LANDSCAPE SCALE BY NUTRIENT-RELATED VARIABLES, WHEREAS MICROBIAL FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY IS DRIVEN LOCALLY THROUGH PLANT COMMUNITY FEEDBACKS.

AS THIS EMISSION IS LARGELY CAUSED BY N MINERALIZATION IN OXIC PEAT SOIL, REWETTING THE PEAT SOIL IS LIKELY TO DECREASE THE N2O EMISSIONS TO SIMILAR LEVELS WITH NATURAL, UNDRAINED PEATLANDS. EMISSIONS FROM THESE WATER-SATURATED PEAT SOILS HAVE OFTEN BEEN ASSUMED NEGLIGIBLE, FOR EXAMPLE IN THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (IPCC) GUIDELINES FOR NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORIES. HOWEVER, THE NUMBER OF PUBLISHED DATA OF ANNUAL N2O EMISSIONS FROM UNDRAINED PEATLANDS IS SMALL AND EVEN SMALLER FOR REWETTED PEATLANDS. THUS, WE STILL HAVE LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTS OF LAND-USE CHANGE SUCH AS DRAINAGE AND REWETTING. WE ANALYZED N2O FLUX DATA, MOSTLY PREVIOUSLY UNPUBLISHED, FROM 28 UNDRAINED, 65 FORESTRY-DRAINED, AND 24 REWETTED BOREAL PEATLAND STUDY SITES IN FINLAND AND CALCULATED ANNUAL N2O EMISSIONS FOR EACH SITE, INCLUDING EMISSIONS FROM DITCHES AT 51 SITES. WE CLASSIFIED THE SITES INTO NUTRIENT-RICH AND NUTRIENT-POOR ONES, SIMILAR TO THE IPCC GUIDELINES. ANNUAL N2O EMISSIONS FROM THE UNDRAINED PEATLANDS WERE CONSISTENTLY SMALL, BUT NOT NEGLIGIBLE, AVERAGING 0.11 AND 0.10 G M-2A 1 IN THE NUTRIENT-RICH AND NUTRIENT-POOR SITES, RESPECTIVELY. EMISSIONS FROM THE DRAINED PEATLANDS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN FROM THE UNDRAINED PEATLANDS IN THE NUTRIENT-RICH (MEAN 0.23 G M(-2) A(-1)) BUT NOT IN THE NUTRIENT-POOR (MEAN 0.08 G M(-2) A(-1)) SITES. EMISSIONS FROM THE REWETTED PEATLANDS (MEANS 0.05 AND 0.08 G M(-2) A(-1) FOR NUTRIENT-RICH AND NUTRIENT-POOR SITES, RESPECTIVELY) WERE SIMILAR OR LOWER THAN FROM THE UNDRAINED ONES. EMISSIONS FROM DITCHES WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE FROM STRIPS AND CORRELATED POSITIVELY WITH STRIP EMISSIONS AT THE DRAINED SITES. NUTRIENT-RICH SOIL (LOW CN RATIO) AND A LOW WATER TABLE INCREASED EMISSIONS SIGNIFICANTLY AT THE DRAINED SITES, WHEREAS THE CONTINUOUSLY HIGHER WATER TABLES KEPT EMISSIONS LOW AT ALL UNDRAINED AND REWETTED SITES. IN CONCLUSION, REWETTING IS AN EFFECTIVE MEANS TO DECREASE THE N2O EMISSIONS OF NUTRIENT-RICH DRAINED PEATLANDS BACK TO NATURAL LEVELS, ALTHOUGH THIS NATURAL LEVEL IS NOT ZERO, AS HAS BEEN SUGGESTED EARLIER.","NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS OF UNDRAINED, FORESTRY-DRAINED, AND REWETTED BOREAL PEATLANDS","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","ARTICLE","DEC 15",2020,"10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118494","FORESTRY","WOS:000585785200001"

THE OBJECTS UNDER STUDY ARE 8 KEY SITES IN DRAINED AND SIMILAR NATURAL PINE-SHRUB-SPHAGNUM RAISED BOG. THE SPECIES COMPOSITION IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE DOMINANCE OF PINUS SYLVESTRIS, LEDUM PALUSTRE, CHAMAEDAPHNE CALCULATA AND SPHAGNUM MOSSES. THE AREA UNDER STUDY WERE DRAINED IN 1980 BY A NETWORK OF OPEN CHANNELS FOR THE PURPOSE OF FOREST MELIORATION AND PEAT EXTRACTION. THE LACK OF PLANTING AND REPAIR OF THE DRAINAGE NETWORK HAS LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SELF-RECOVERY PROCESSES IN DRAINED MIRES. FIELD STUDIES OF THE SITES INCLUDED THE ACCESS OF PEAT DEPOSIT DEPTHS, SELECTING STRATIGRAPHIC LAYER BY TYPE AND DEGREE OF DECOMPOSITION OF PEAT BY VISUAL METHOD; SAMPLING PEAT IN STEPS OF 5 CM TO A DEPTH OF 90 CM USING A RUSSIAN PEAT CORER. LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF PEAT INCLUDED DETERMINATION OF THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS: BOTANICAL COMPOSITION, DEGREE OF DECOMPOSITION, ASH CONTENT, WATER CONTENT, BULK DENSITY. WE TAKE ANALYZED A TOTAL OF 162 PEAT SAMPLES. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DIFFERENCES IN THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF PEAT IN DRAINED AND NATURAL BOGS WAS ASSESSED USING THE MANN-WHITNEY TEST (U-TEST). CLASSIFICATION OF SITES BY CRITERIA OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF PEAT WAS PERFORMED BY CLUSTER ANALYSIS. THE CONSEQUENCES OF DRAINAGE ARE MANIFESTED IN A CHANGE IN THE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF MOSSES AND AN INCREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF WOOD RESIDUES IN THE PEAT DEPOSIT UPPER LAYER. ON TWO SITES, THE CHANGE OF BALTICUM AND MAGELLANICUM PEAT TO FUSCUM PEAT AT A DEPTH OF 25 CM WAS NOTED. THE OTHER SITE IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE APPEARANCE OF UPPER LAYER OF GREEN MOSSES IN THE PEAT COMPOSITION WITH A MAXIMUM SHARE OF THEIR PRESENCE AT A DEPTH OF 15-20 CM. TWO SITES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THE FORMATION OF WOOD PEAT IN THE UPPER LAYER, WITH ALMOST COMPLETE ABSENCE OF SPHAGNUM MOSS RESIDUES HERE, WHICH CAN BE AN INDICATOR OF THE ALMOST COMPLETE ABSENCE OF THE PROCESS OF PEAT DEPOSITS MODERN ACCUMULATION. AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY, IT IS SHOWN THAT THE BULK DENSITY OF PEAT CHARACTERIZES THE RATE OF ACCUMULATION OF PEAT AND IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE ASH CONTENT AND THE DEGREE OF DECOMPOSITION. THE INCREASE IN DENSITY IN THE PEAT LAYER AT DEPTHS UP TO 25 CM CORRESPONDS TO THE PERIOD OF PEAT ACCUMULATION DURING THE MAXIMUM EFFECT OF DRAINAGE. THE CHANGE IN ASH CONTENT WITH DEPTH AND A MAXIMUM VALUE IN THE LAYER OF 15-35 CM IS AN INDICATOR OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE PEAT LAYER LOCATED ON THE SURFACE DURING THE FIRST YEARS AFTER DRAINAGE, AND IS GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE LAWS OF BULK DENSITY CHANGES IN DEPTH. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE PEAT LAYER FORMED AFTER DRAINAGE RECLAMATION CHANGES FROM 0 TO 25-30 CM IN DIFFERENT KEY SITES. IN 6 OF THE 8 STUDIED SITES, THE PROCESS OF MODERN PEAT ACCUMULATION IS OBSERVED; IN TWO SITES, THE RATE OF PEAT ACCUMULATION IS MINIMAL OR COMPLETELY ABSENT.","ESTIMATION OF THE RAISED BOGS PEAT DEPOSIT TRANSFORMATION OF WEST SIBERIA SOUTH-EASTERN PART","GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH","ARTICLE","MAR",2020,"10.17223/25421379/14/6","GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000537749000008"

IN GENERAL, PLANT FUNCTIONAL TYPES/GROWTH FORMS DID NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THEIR GPP AT THE DRAINED SITE EXCEPT SHRUBS WHICH HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER GPP AT PAR LEVEL GREATER THAN 1000 MU MOL/M(2)/S (F(3,30.84) = 11.64, P < 0.001). AT THE NATURAL SITE, GPP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AT THE HOLLOW (0.168 +/- 0.02 MG/M(2)/S) COMPARED TO THE HUMMOCK (0.098 +/- 0.01 MG/M(2)/S) WHERE RELATIVELY THE HIGHER WTD WAS RECORDED. WE THEREFORE CONCLUDED THAT WATER SHORTAGE TO THE SHALLOW ROOTING DEPTH OF SHRUBS ON OUR HUMMOCK SUBPLOTS MAY BE THE CAUSE OF THE LOW PRODUCTIVITY. AT PAR GREATER THAN 1000 MU MOL/M(2)/S, PRODUCTIVITY AT THE HOLLOW WAS STILL SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER (0.17 +/- 0.002 MG/M(2)/S) COMPARED TO THE HUMMOCK (0.10 +/- 0.00 MG/M(2)/S). THIS SUGGESTS THAT, FOR ECOSYSTEM CARBON MODELLING, THE MINIMUM PAR LEVEL AT WHICH THE GPP IS ESTIMATED IS VERY CRUCIAL. ALL THE GROWTH FORMS AT THE DRAINED SITE RECORDED A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER GPP THAN THE MICROFORMS AT THE NATURAL SITE. WE SPECULATE THAT NOT ONLY HYDROLOGICAL CHANGES VIA AGRICULTURAL DRAINAGE CAN AFFECT THE CARBON BALANCE OF BOREAL PEATLAND ECOSYSTEM THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS, BUT ALSO THE HYDROLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE PEAT DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN PEAT SOIL MAKEUP, STRUCTURE AND DENSITY. WE, THEREFORE, CONCLUDE THAT DIFFERENCES IN MICROTOPOGRAPHY AND THE CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN VEGETATION, LAND-USE PRACTICE AND ITS EFFECTS ON PEAT SOIL PROPERTIES AND HYDROLOGY SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN MODELLING THE GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION IN A PEATLAND ECOSYSTEM.","AGRICULTURAL DRAINAGE INCREASES THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC CAPACITY OF BOREAL PEATLANDS","AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","ARTICLE","SEP 15",2020,"10.1016/j.agee.2020.106984","AGRICULTURE, MULTIDISCIPLINARY; ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000540169600012"

DOC CONCENTRATION RANGED FROM 4.82 MG CENTER DOT L(-1)TO 47.83 MG CENTER DOT L-1, WITH A MEAN VALUE OF 15.04 MG CENTER DOT L-1, 2.84 TIMES HIGHER THAN THE GLOBAL AVERAGE. THE ZOIGE RIVERS HAD HIGHER DOC CONCENTRATION AND HIGHLY TERRIGENOUS CDOM. SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DOC CONCENTRATION WAS OBSERVED FOR THE ZOIGE RIVERS IN THE WET SEASON COMPARED TO THE DRY SEASON. IN CONTRAST, THE ALPINE-GORGE RIVERS HAD HIGHER DOC LEVELS IN THE DRY SEASON. NO SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN DOC AND CDOM AT ALL RIVERS DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF AUTOCHTHONOUS SOURCES ON THE ALPINE-GORGE RIVERS AND INTENSIVE PHOTOCHEMICAL DEGRADATION OF TERRIGENOUS DOM IN THE ZOIGE RIVERS. SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CDOM AND SPECIFIC ULTRAVIOLET ABSORBANCE AT 254 NM (SUVA(254)) AND BETWEEN CDOM/DOC AND SUVA(254)WERE OBSERVED, INDICATING THAT THE AROMATICITY OF DOM IN THE RIVERS WAS MAINLY DETERMINED BY CDOM.

HOWEVER, PERTURBATIONS SUCH AS DRAINAGE INCREASE PEAT OXIDATION, WHICH MAY LEAD TO ENHANCED GASEOUS RELEASE OF CARBON. FOR THIS REASON, THE NUMBER OF RESTORATION PROJECTS THAT AIM TO REWET BLANKET BOGS HAS INCREASED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, BUT THERE IS STILL A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF RESTORATION ON EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES, SUCH AS METHANE, PARTICULARLY IN SITES RESTORED FROM FORESTRY. IN THIS PAPER, WE INVESTIGATE THE SEASONAL GREENHOUSE GAS DYNAMICS IN A FOREST-TO-BOG RESTORATION SITE IN SCOTLAND. WE ANALYSE THE EFFECTS OF RESTORATION ON BOTH CARBON DIOXIDE AND METHANE FLUXES, AND INVESTIGATE WHICH SITE FACTORS (MICROTOPOGRAPHY, VEGETATION TYPE, SOIL MOISTURE AND TEMPERATURE) DRIVE THE PROCESSES OF GASEOUS EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE BOG SURFACE AND THE ATMOSPHERE. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ORIGINAL SURFACE IS NEAR GREENHOUSE GASE EQUILIBRIUM AT -0.28 GCO(2)EQ M(2)CENTER DOT DAY(-1) AND THAT MICROTOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES ACT AS A NET GREENHOUSE GAS SINK (RIDGES = -0.94 GCO(2)EQ M(2)CENTER DOT DAY(-1) AND FURROWS = -0.86 GCO(2)EQ M(2)CENTER DOT DAY(-1)), WHEREAS THE BOG POOL IS A NET SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GASES (0.98 GCO(2)EQ M(2)CENTER DOT DAY(-1)).

THE RESEARCH RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PROXIMATE METHOD OF MICRO WOUNDING FOR THE SHORTEST PERIOD OF TIME ALLOWS US TO GET RELIABLE DATA ON THE RESIN PRODUCTIVITY OF DRAINED PINE FORESTS, WHICH CAN SERVE AS A GENERAL INDICATOR OF THE LIVING CONDITION OF PINE TREES. THE 5-YEAR OBSERVATION PERIOD FOR DRAINABLE PINE FORESTS LED TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS: THE RESIN PRODUCTIVITY IN JUNE IS BY 21 % HIGHER THAN IN AVERAGE FOR THE WHOLE SUMMER PERIOD; IN THE CANALSIDE DRAINED AREA THE TURPENTINE YIELD IS BY 10 % MORE INTENSE, THAN IN THE INTERCHANNEL ONE; THINNING AFFECTS POSITIVELY AS THE RESIN PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES BY 42 % COMPARING TO THE PINE STAND THAT WAS ONLY DRAINED. 3-YEAR MONITORING OF DRAINABLE PINE STANDS CAN GIVE THE MOST RELIABLE RESULTS WHEN ESTABLISHING THEIR RESIN PRODUCTIVITY.","SEASONAL RESIN PRODUCTIVITY DYNAMICS OF DRAINED PINE STANDS","LESNOY ZHURNAL-FORESTRY JOURNAL","ARTICLE",NA,2017,"10.17238/issn0536-1036.2017.1.21","FORESTRY","WOS:000461076200002"

EVIDENCE FROM RADIOCARBON DATING SUGGESTS THAT DOC IN SURFACE WATERS IS TYPICALLY DERIVED FROM RECENTLY PHOTOSYNTHESISED ORGANIC MATTER SUCH AS PLANT LITTER AND EXUDATES, YET THERE IS LITTLE INFORMATION ON THE PH-SENSITIVITY OF ORGANIC MATTER SOLUBILITY, OR ITS DECOMPOSITION, IN LITTER LAYERS AND IN DIFFERENT ORGANIC SOILS. THEREFORE THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE A) THE SENSITIVITY OF DOC TO ACIDITY IN DIFFERENT SURFACE LAYERS AND SOIL TYPES, IN ORDER TO B) IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE KEY SOURCES CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASING DOC TREND. SUCH INFORMATION IS VITAL FOR UNDERSTANDING SITE SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS CONTRIBUTING TO INCONSISTENCIES IN DOC RELEASE BETWEEN CATCHMENTS, AND FOR IMPROVING PREDICTIONS OF CARBON FLUXES AND BUDGETS. BASED ON DATA COLLECTED AT FOUR ESTABLISHED FIELD PH-MANIPULATION EXPERIMENTS IN UPLAND AREAS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, WE EXAMINED THE SOURCES, COMPOSITION AND ACID-SENSITIVITY OF DOC EXPORT FROM THE LITTER AND ORGANIC SOILS. WE FOUND THAT LITTER GENERATED NEARLY THREE TIMES MORE DOC THAN THE ORGANIC SOILS, CONSISTENT WITH RADIOCARBON EVIDENCE THAT RECENT PLANT INPUTS ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF DOC. FURTHERMORE, LITTER DERIVED DOC HAD LOWER SPECIFIC ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT ABSORBANCE (SUVA) THAN ORGANIC SOIL DOC, SUGGESTING GREATER BIODEGRADABILITY, AND WAS NOT ACID SENSITIVE. IN CONTRAST, ORGANIC SOIL DOC CONCENTRATIONS WERE MORE STRONGLY RELATED TO EXPERIMENTALLY MANIPULATED PH, IMPLYING THAT THEMOBILITY OF THIS DOC MAY BE SUBJECT TO PHYSICOCHEMICAL RATHER THAN BIOTIC CONTROLS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT PHYSICOCHEMICALLY MEDIATED CONTROLS ON ORGANIC MATTER SOLUBILITY MAY BE A KEY DRIVER BEHIND THE WIDELY OBSERVED INCREASES IN SURFACE WATER DOC IN AREAS UNDERGOING RECOVERY FROM ACIDIFICATION.

GIVEN THAT DECOMPOSERS ARE OFTEN BETTER COMPETITORS FOR NUTRIENTS THAN PRIMARY PRODUCERS IN AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS, WE PREDICTED THAT LABILE CARBON SUBSIDIES WOULD SHIFT THE BIOFILM COMPOSITION TOWARDS HETEROTROPHY OWING TO THE ABILITY OF DECOMPOSERS TO OUTCOMPETE PRIMARY PRODUCERS FOR AVAILABLE NUTRIENTS IN THE ABSENCE OF CARBON LIMITATION. WE MANIPULATED NUTRIENTS (NITRATE AND PHOSPHATE) AND ORGANIC CARBON (GLUCOSE) IN A FULL FACTORIAL DESIGN USING NUTRIENT-DIFFUSING SUBSTRATES IN AN ALASKAN FEN. HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIA WERE LIMITED BY ORGANIC CARBON AND ALGAE WERE LIMITED BY INORGANIC NUTRIENTS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOMES OF COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS DEPENDED ON BACKGROUND NUTRIENT LEVELS. HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIA WERE ABLE TO OUTCOMPETE ALGAE FOR AVAILABLE NUTRIENTS WHEN ORGANIC CARBON WAS ELEVATED AND NUTRIENT LEVELS REMAINED LOW, BUT NOT WHEN ORGANIC CARBON AND NUTRIENTS WERE BOTH ELEVATED THROUGH ENRICHMENT. FUNGAL BIOMASS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE PRESENCE OF GLUCOSE ALONE, POSSIBLY OWING TO ANTAGONISTIC INTERACTIONS WITH HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIA.

TRUNK WOOD QUALITIES AND, HENCE, THE OUTPUT OF THE MOST VALUABLE TRUNK SECTIONS ARE CONTINGENT ON THE VOLUME AND ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE OF RADIAL INCREMENT. THIS PAPER SHOWS THE EFFECT OF FERTILIZATION AND HERBICIDE TREATMENTS ON THE ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE OF WOOD IN PINE PLANTATIONS OF DIFFERENT STOCKING RATES IN DRAINED PEAT SOILS. VARIATIONS OF LATE WOOD SHARE AND DENSITY ARE DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHANGES IN ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE OF WOOD. FERTILIZATION OF PINE PLANTATIONS WITH DENSITY OF 4000 AND 2000 TREES/HA INCREASED THE NUMBER OF EARLY TRACHEID ROWS IN THE PROCESS OF THEIR GROWTH. THE APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS AND HERBICIDES IN PINE PLANTATIONS STOCKED AT 1000 TREES/HA INDUCED A GRADUAL REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF EARLY TRACHEID ROWS. A COMBINED MINERAL FERTILIZER PLUS HERBICIDE TREATMENT ENLARGED THE NUMBER OF LATE TRACHEID ROWS IN WOOD OF THE PLANTATIONS STOCKED AT VARIOUS RATES. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF TRACHEID ROWS PER ANNUAL RING INCREASED IN THE PLANTATIONS STOCKED AT A RATE OF 4000 AND 2000 TREES/HA. THE REDUCTION IN TOTAL NUMBER OF TRACHEID ROWS OF PLANTATIONS WITH 1000 TREES/HA STOCKING RATE IS DOWN TO MINERAL FERTILIZATION COMBINED WITH HERBICIDE TREATMENTS. FERTILIZER AND HERBICIDE TREATMENT OF THE PLANTATIONS WITH THE INITIAL DENSITY OF 4000 TREES/HA LEADS TO THE FORMATION OF THICK-WALLED EARLY AND LATE TRACHEIDS. APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS IN PINE PLANTATIONS WITH 1000 AND 2000 TREES/HA STOCKING RATES PROMOTE THE FORMATION OF EARLY AND LATE TRACHEIDS OF A LARGER DIAMETER.

AVERAGE ANNUAL EMISSIONS FROM CONSTANTLY DRAINED SOILS WERE 298 G CO2-C M(-2) YR(-1), WITH MOST OF THE OXIDATION TAKING PLACE BETWEEN JUNE AND OCTOBER. SHORT FLOOD CYCLES INCREASED ANNUAL OXIDATION RATES COMPARED WITH CONSTANTLY DRAINED SOILS, WHICH HAD THE SECOND HIGHEST OXIDATION RATE.

IN RECENT YEARS, THE INTEREST IN PALUDICULTURE, I.E. THE USE OF REWETTED PEATLANDS, HAS GROWN BECAUSE OF ITS POTENTIAL TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS BY STOPPING SOIL DECOMPOSITION. MOREOVER, CULTIVATING WETLAND PLANTS ON REWETTED PEATLANDS FOR BIOENERGY PRODUCTION THAT REPLACES FOSSIL FUELS IN THE TRANSPORT SECTOR, CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ADDITIONAL GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS. IN THIS STUDY, AN ANALYSIS OF LITERATURE DATA WAS CONDUCTED TO OBTAIN DATA ON GHG EMISSIONS (CO2 AND CH4) AND BIOMASS PRODUCTION FROM REWETTED PEATLANDS CULTIVATED WITH TWO DIFFERENT WETLAND PLANT SPECIES: PHRAGMITES AUSTRALIS (PA) AND TYPHA LATIFOLIA (TL). IN ADDITION, A BIOGAS EXPERIMENT WAS CARRIED OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE BIOMETHANE YIELD OF PA AND TL BIOMASS, AND THE REDUCTION OF GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) BY USING BIOMETHANE AS VEHICLE FUEL. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT PEATLAND REWETTING CAN BE AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO MITIGATE THE GWP AS IT REDUCES GHG EMISSIONS FROM THE SOIL, PARTICULARLY ON A 100-YEAR TIMESCALE BUT ALSO TO SOME EXTENT ON A 20-YEAR TIMESCALE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, REWETTING OF 1 KM(2) OF PEATLAND CAN RESULT IN A GWP REDUCTION CORRESPONDING TO THE EMISSIONS FROM +/- 2600 AVERAGE SIZED PETROL CARS ANNUALLY. GROWING PA ON REWETTED PEATLANDS REDUCES SOIL GHG EMISSIONS MORE THAN GROWING TL, BUT PA AND TL PRODUCED SIMILAR AMOUNTS OF BIOMASS AND BIOMETHANE PER LAND AREA.

THE EFFECT OF VDS WAS EVALUATED FROM FIELD OBSERVATIONS ON THE SETTLEMENT OF TEST EMBANKMENTS CONSTRUCTED IN HOKKAIDO, JAPAN, AND SIMULATIONS USING THE FINITE-ELEMENT METHOD WERE PERFORMED TO INTERPRET THE BEHAVIOR OF THE GROUND. A SYSTEMATIC SERIES OF PARAMETRIC ANALYSES DEMONSTRATED THAT, IN PEAT GROUND WITH A HIGH NATURAL WATER CONTENT, THE PERMEABILITY DECREASES DRASTICALLY AS THE LOAD INCREASES, AND HENCE THE RESIDUAL SETTLEMENT INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY AND THE STABILITY IS GREATLY REDUCED.

THIS INDICATES THAT THE EFFECT OF DRAINAGE CONDITIONS ON PEAT DECOMPOSITION IS DETERMINED BY LANDFORM CONDITION. ON THE OTHER HAND, IN THE CASE OF THE LAND COVERED WITH MINERAL SOILS ON THE SURFACE, SAPRIC PEAT SOIL DISTRIBUTION WAS NOT WELL ESTIMATED. DETERMINING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE DISTRIBUTION TREND OF SAPRIC PEAT SOILS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS BY ANALYZING THE EXISTING GIS DATABASE IS A NEW APPLICATION. THIS WAS ACHIEVED BY THE COMBINATION OF GIS AND QUANTIFICATION METHOD TYPE II, WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PEAT DECOMPOSITION PROCESS FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS.","CONTROLLING FACTORS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF SAPRIC PEAT SOILS EXTRACTED BY GIS ANALYSIS","SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION","ARTICLE","JAN 2",2019,"10.1080/00380768.2018.1544833","PLANT SCIENCES; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; SOIL SCIENCE","WOS:000458167400007"

INFRARED SPECTROSCOPIC MODELING CAN LINK AND MASSIVELY SCALE UP THESE METHODS FOR MANY SOIL CHARACTERISTICS IN A COST-EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY MANNER. IN SWITZERLAND, ONLY 10 % TO 15 % OF AGRICULTURAL SOILS HAVE BEEN MAPPED SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE SPATIAL DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS, PRESENTING AN URGENT NEED FOR RAPID QUANTITATIVE SOIL CHARACTERIZATION. THE CURRENT SWISS SOIL SPECTRAL LIBRARY (SSL; N = 4374) IN THE MID-INFRARED RANGE INCLUDES SOIL SAMPLES FROM THE BIODIVERSITY MONITORING PROGRAM (BDM), ARRANGED IN A REGULARLY SPACED GRID ACROSS SWITZERLAND, AND TEMPORALLY RESOLVED DATA FROM THE SWISS SOIL MONITORING NETWORK (NABO). GIVEN THAT LESS THAN 2 % OF THE SAMPLES IN THE SSL ORIGINATE FROM ORGANIC SOILS, WE AIMED TO DEVELOP BOTH AN EFFICIENT CALIBRATION SAMPLING SCHEME AND ACCURATE MODELING STRATEGY TO ESTIMATE THE SOIL CARBON (SC) CONTENTS OF HETEROGENEOUS SAMPLES BETWEEN 0 AND 2 M DEPTH FROM 26 LOCATIONS WITHIN TWO DRAINED PEATLAND REGIONS (SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURAL, FOREST AND FOOD SCIENCES (HAFL) DATA SET; N = 116). THE FOCUS WAS ON MINIMIZING THE NEED FOR NEW REFERENCE ANALYSES BY EFFICIENTLY MINING THE SPECTRAL INFORMATION OF THE SSL. WE USED PARTIAL LEAST SQUARE REGRESSIONS (PLSRS), TOGETHER WITH FIVE REPETITIONS OF A LOCATION-GROUPED, 10-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION, TO PREDICT SC RANGING FROM 1 % TO 52 % IN THE LOCAL HAFL DATA SET. WE COMPARED THE VALIDATION PERFORMANCE OF DIFFERENT CALIBRATION SCHEMES INVOLVING LOCAL MODELS (1), MODELS USING THE ENTIRE SSL COMBINED WITH LOCAL SAMPLES (2), COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS SPIKING, AND SUBSETS OF LOCAL AND SSL SAMPLES OPTIMIZED FOR THE PEATLAND TARGET SITES USING THE RESAMPLING LOCAL (RS-LOCAL) ALGORITHM (3). USING LOCAL AND RS-LOCAL CALIBRATIONS WITH AT LEAST FIVE LOCAL SAMPLES, WE ACHIEVED SIMILAR VALIDATION RESULTS FOR PREDICTIONS OF SC UP TO 52 % (R-2 = 0.93 TO 0.97; BIAS = -0.07 TO 1.65; ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR (RMSE) = 2.71 % TO 3.89 % TOTAL CARBON; RATIO OF PERFORMANCE TO DEVIATION (RPD) = 3.38 TO 4.86; AND RATIO OF PERFORMANCE TO INTERQUARTILE RANGE (RPIQ) = 4.93 TO 7.09). HOWEVER, CALIBRATIONS USING RS-LOCAL ONLY REQUIRED FIVE OR 10 LOCAL SAMPLES FOR VERY ACCURATE MODELS (RMSE = 3.16 % AND 2.71 % TOTAL CARBON, RESPECTIVELY), WHILE PURELY LOCAL CALIBRATIONS REQUIRED 50 SAMPLES FOR SIMILARLY ACCURATE RESULTS (RMSE < 3 % TOTAL CARBON). OF THE THREE APPROACHES, THE ENTIRE SSL SPIKED WITH LOCAL SAMPLES FOR MODEL CALIBRATION LED TO VALIDATIONS WITH THE LOWEST PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF R-2, BIAS, RMSE, RPD AND RPIQ. HENCE, WE SHOW THAT A SIMPLE AND COMPREHENSIBLE MODELING APPROACH, USING RS-LOCAL TOGETHER WITH A SSL, IS AN EFFICIENT AND ACCURATE STRATEGY WHEN USING INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY. IT DECREASES FIELD AND LABORATORY WORK, THE BIAS OF SSL SPIKING APPROACHES AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF LOCAL MODELS. IF ADEQUATELY MINED, THE INFORMATION IN THE SSL IS SUFFICIENT TO PREDICT SC IN NEW AND INDEPENDENT STUDY REGIONS, EVEN IF THE LOCAL SOIL CHARACTERISTICS ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONES IN THE SSL.

ABIOTIC PARAMETERS (GROUNDWATER DYNAMICS, WATER AND SOIL CHARACTERISTICS) WERE MEASURED AT 35 SITES. MACRO-REMAIN ANALYSES OF 42 SOIL PROFILES WERE USED TO RECONSTRUCT THE LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT OF MIRES. VEGETATION WAS DIFFERENTIATED BY USING CONVENTIONAL (BRAUN-BLANQUET) AND MULTIVARIATE METHODS (CLUSTER ANALYSIS, ORDINATION). A COMBINATION OF HYDROGENETIC CRITERIA, CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF PEAT AND SOIL WATER, BOTANICAL COMPOSITION OF PEAT AND CURRENT VEGETATION WAS APPLIED TO CLASSIFY MIRE TYPES. RESULTS: EIGHT VEGETATION TYPES WERE DELIMITED AND CHARACTERIZED PERTAINING TO THEIR ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS. AN ACIDITY-ALKALINITY GRADIENT WAS DOCUMENTED FOR THE DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES. HYDROLOGICAL DATA INDICATED DIFFERENCES IN HUMAN IMPACT ON MIRES. ALL TRANSITIONS BETWEEN SOLIGENOUS, OMBRO-SOLIGENOUS AND OMBROGENOUS MIRES WERE FOUND ALONG TRANSECTS INCLUDING SHALLOW BOGS ON HILLTOPS VIA BASE-RICH FENS ON SLOPES, TO TRANSITION MIRES AT THE ONSET AND DEEPER BOGS IN THE CENTER OF TERRACES.

IN A BEECH (FAGUS SYLVATICA L.) FOREST NEAR SORO, DENMARK, SOC STOCKS AND THE RISK OF LOSING PRE-DRAINAGE LEGACY SOC WERE STUDIED USING A DIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL (0.4 M RESOLUTION), REDOX POTENTIAL AND SOIL RESPIRATION MEASUREMENTS. THE RESULTS WERE COMPARED WITH A DIGITIZED LEGACY SOIL MAP USED IN THE NATIONAL GHG REPORTING TO UNFCCC. IN UPLAND, FLAT AND SLOPING TERRAIN, AN AEROBIC SOIL ENVIRONMENT (EH > 400 MV) PREVAILED THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE YEAR, BUT IN A PEAT-FILLED TOPOGRAPHIC DEPRESSION (TD) ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS (EH < 400 MV) FULLY OR SPORADICALLY OCCURRED IN THE GROWING SEASON, CONTROLLED BY THE DITCHING-AFFECTED WATER TABLE. THE RELIEF INCLUDED SOC RICH TDS MAKING UP 18.9% OF THE AREA BASED ON THE ""FILLED SINK"" ALGORITHM (SAGA GIS). IN CONTRAST, THE PEAT COVER ON THE LEGACY SOIL MAP WAS 8.2%. FURTHERMORE, THE MAPPED PEAT POLYGONS WERE OFFSET FROM THE TDS DEFINED BY THE DEM. THE SOC STOCKS AT 0-40 CM DEPTH OUTSIDE TDS (LEAST SQUARES MEAN 8.4 +/- SEM 0.3 KG C M(-2)) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN WITHIN TDS (11.9 +/- SEM 0.5 KG C M(-2)). AVERAGE ANNUAL SOIL RESPIRATION INCREASED LINEARLY WITH THE SOC STOCK BY 0.06 KG C PER KG SOC UP TO A SOC STOCK OF 11 KG C M(-2) TO 20 CM DEPTH, AND A SOC LOSS OF 0.23 +/- SE 0.10 KG C M(-2) YR(-1) WAS INDICATED INSIDE THE TD AREAS, CLOSE TO THE IPCC ESTIMATE OF 0.26 KG C M(-2) YR(-1) FOR DRAINED ORGANIC SOILS UNDER FOREST. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT CONTINUOUS SENSOR-BASED MONITORING OF REDOX POTENTIAL AND SHALLOW WATER TABLES LINKED WITH HIGH-RESOLUTION DEMS OFFER THE POSSIBILITY TO ESTIMATE THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF INLAND WETLAND MINERAL SOILS AND THEIR STATUS AS AEROBIC OR ANAEROBIC AS INDICATED BY IRON RODS WITH HIGHER ACCURACY THAN PREVIOUSLY.

FOREST CLEAR-CUTTING AND PEATLAND DITCHING), PROCESSES THAT POTENTIALLY INCREASE LEACHING OF PEAT- AND SOIL-STORED MERCURY INTO LAKE ECOSYSTEMS. WE SAMPLED BIOTIC COMMUNITIES FROM PRIMARY PRODUCERS (ALGAE) TO TOP CONSUMERS (PISCIVOROUS FISH), IN 19 SUBARCTIC LAKES SITUATED ON A LATITUDINAL (69.0 & NDASH;66.5 DEGREES N), CLIMATIC (+3.2 DEGREES C TEMPERATURE AND +30% PRECIPITATION FROM NORTH TO SOUTH) AND CATCHMENT LAND-USE (PRISTINE TO INTENSIVE FORESTRY AREAS) GRADIENT. WE FIRST TESTED HOW THE JOINT EFFECTS OF CLIMATE AND PRODUCTIVITY INFLUENCE MERCURY BIOMAGNIFICATION IN FOOD WEBS FOCUSING ON THE TROPHIC MAGNIFICATION SLOPE (TMS) AND MERCURY BASELINE (THG BASELINE) LEVEL, BOTH DERIVED FROM LINEAR REGRESSION BETWEEN TOTAL MERCURY (LOG10THG) AND ORGANISM TROPHIC LEVEL (TL). WE EXAMINED A SUITE OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND BIOTIC VARIABLES THOUGHT TO EXPLAIN THG BASELINE AND TMS WITH STEPWISE GENERALIZED MULTIPLE REGRESSION MODELS. FINALLY, WE ASSESSED HOW CLIMATE AND LAKE PRODUCTIVITY AFFECT THE THG CONTENT OF TOP PREDATORS IN SUBARCTIC LAKES. WE FOUND BIOMAGNIFICATION OF MERCURY IN ALL STUDIED LAKES, BUT WITH VARIABLE TMS AND THG BASELINE VALUES. IN STEPWISE MULTIPLE REGRESSION MODELS, TMS WAS BEST EXPLAINED BY NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH FOOD CHAIN LENGTH, CLIMATE-PRODUCTIVITY GRADIENT, CATCHMENT PROPERTIES, AND ELEMENTAL C:N RATIO OF THE TOP PREDATOR (FULL MODEL R2 = 0.90, P < 0.001). THE MODEL EXAMINING VARIATION IN THG BASELINE VALUES INCLUDED THE SAME VARIABLES WITH POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS (R2 = 0.69, P = 0.014). MASS STANDARDIZED THG CONTENT OF A COMMON TOP PREDATOR (1 KG NORTHERN PIKE, ESOX LUCIUS) INCREASED TOWARDS WARMER AND MORE PRODUCTIVE LAKES. RESULTS INDICATE THAT INCREASING EUTROPHICATION VIA FORESTRY-RELATED LAND-USE ACTIVITIES INCREASE THE THG LEVELS AT THE BASE OF THE FOOD WEB AND IN TOP PREDATORS, SUGGESTING THAT THE SOURCES OF NUTRIENTS AND MERCURY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN FUTURE BIOACCUMULATION AND BIOMAGNIFICATION STUDIES.

ASSEMBLAGES IN DITCHES ARE REGULARLY DISTURBED BY DITCH MAINTENANCE, BUT THE EXTENT OF THESE DISTURBANCES AND MITIGATION POSSIBILITIES ARE POORLY DOCUMENTED. WE CONDUCTED AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY IN THREE COMMERCIALLY MANAGED FOREST PLOTS IN EASTERN ESTONIA, AIMING TO FIND OUT HOW DITCH NETWORK MAINTENANCE (DNM) AFFECTS THE DIVERSITY AND ASSEMBLAGES OF AQUATIC MACROINVERTEBRATES IN DITCHES AND REMNANT POOLS, AND WHETHER THIS EFFECT CAN BE ALLEVIATED BY CONSTRUCTING MITIGATION WATERBODIES. FOR COMPARISON WE ALSO COLLECTED DATA FROM NATURAL POOLS IN THREE UNDRAINED FOREST PLOTS. BEFORE DNM, DITCHES SUPPORTED GREATER NUMBER OF HIGHER TAXA COMPARED TO REMNANT AND NATURAL POOLS AND MORE STRICTLY AQUATIC TAXA, WHEREAS NATURAL POOLS IN UNDRAINED PLOTS SUPPORTED MORE TRICHOPTERA SHREDDERS. AFTER DNM, THE DIVERSITY IN REMNANT POOLS DECREASED. MOREOVER, MAJORITY OF THE POOLS DRIED OUT, WHICH RESULTED IN FURTHER REDUCTION OF THE RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF MACROINVERTEBRATES. IN DITCHES THE DIVERSITY DROPPED IMMEDIATELY AFTER DNM, BUT RECOVERED IN TWO TO THREE YEARS. NEVERTHELESS, PLOT-SCALE RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE DID NOT COMPLETELY RECOVER. ASSEMBLAGE SHIFT IN DITCHES TOOK PLACE RIGHT AFTER DNM AND REMAINED DISTINCT AFTER THE FOUR YEAR SURVEY PERIOD. MITIGATION POOLS PROVIDED HABITAT FOR SEVERAL TAXA (ESPECIALLY ODONATA) UNCOMMON IN OTHER WATERBODIES IN DRAINED AND UNDRAINED PLOTS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT DNM IN FORESTS SUBSTANTIALLY IMPOVERISHES HABITAT AVAILABILITY AND REDUCES THE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF AQUATIC MACROINVERTEBRATES.

IN A REGIME OF ACCELERATING SLR, SALTMARSH SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON THE ABILITY OF THE MARSH PLATFORM TO GROW VERTICALLY THROUGH ORGANIC AND INORGANIC ACCUMULATION, AND LATERALLY VIA TRANSGRESSION OVER ADJACENT UPLANDS. IN FORMERLY GLACIATED SETTINGS, THE FORMATION AND MAINTENANCE OF A SALTMARSH ARE COMPLICATED BY STEEP UPLANDS, LOW SEDIMENT AVAILABILITY, ISOSTATIC REBOUND, CHANGES TO TIDAL AMPLITUDES, AND ANTHROPOGENIC ALTERATION. WHILE MUCH WORK HAS EXAMINED THE DEVELOPMENT OF LARGE SALTMARSHES IN NEW ENGLAND SINCE THE MID-HOLOCENE AND ANTHROPOCENE, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SMALLER ISOLATED SALTMARSHES THAT FORM IN POCKETS ALONG THE GLACIATED COASTLINE. WE USE RADIOCARBON DATES FROM NEWLY UNCOVERED INDEX POINTS (BASAL PEAT) WITHIN BOSTON HARBOR TO DATE ONE OF THE OLDEST SALTMARSHES IN THE REGION (SIMILAR TO 4.2 KA), AND CALCULATE THE POLYNOMIAL RELATIVE SEA-LEVEL CURVE (RSLR) FOR THE LOWER GULF OF MAINE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT TIDAL AMPLIFICATION THROUGHOUT THE HOLOCENE. THIS STUDY INFORMS THE HISTORICAL PERSISTENCE OF ISOLATED SALTMARSHES UNDER VARYING RATES OF SEA-LEVEL RISE (MAGNITUDE AS MUCH AS 2 MM YR(-1)). ADDITIONALLY, WE REFINE THE TIMING AND RATES OF THE MID-HOLOCENE SEA-LEVEL DECELERATION IN THIS REGION: BETWEEN 2.8 AND 3.3 KA, SLOWING FROM 2.1 MM YR(-1) TO 0.5 MM YR(-1). RSLR DETERMINED FROM THE PAST CENTURY OF TIDE GAUGE DATA IS 2.86 MM YR(-1), FIVE TIMES GREATER THAN HISTORIC RATES OVER THE PAST 2000 YEARS. RECENT VERTICAL ACCRETION RATES (DETERMINED FROM MARKER HORIZONS AND PB-210 DATA) INDICATE THAT PORTIONS OF BOSTON HARBOR'S SALTMARSHES ARE ABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH CURRENT RSLR. HOWEVER, HISTORICAL DIKING AND DITCHING PRACTICES APPEAR TO HAVE RESULTED IN ELEVATION LOSS AND CONVERSION FROM HIGH SALTMARSH PLATFORMS TO LOW SALTMARSH PLATFORMS, LARGELY INFLUENCING THE AMOUNT OF INORGANIC SEDIMENT NEEDED TO HELP MAINTAIN MARSH SURFACES. THESE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THAT KNOWLEDGE OF HISTORICAL ANTHROPOGENIC MODIFICATIONS AND CHANGES IN HYDROPERIOD ARE CRITICAL WHEN INTERPRETING VERTICAL ACCRETION RESULTS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, ANTHROPOGENIC MODIFICATION WITHIN SEDIMENT STARVED SALTMARSHES MAY BE THE CAUSE FOR CANNIBALIZATION OF MARSH SHORELINES, WHEREBY INORGANIC SEDIMENT ERODED FROM MARSH EDGES IS RECYCLED AND DELIVERED TO THE SURFACE, FACILITATING VERTICAL ACCRETION THAT OFFSETS RSLR. UNDER MODERN ACCELERATED SEA-LEVEL RISE AND DECREASED SEDIMENT SUPPLY, THIS CANNIBALIZATION PROCESS MAY NOW BE THE ONLY PATHWAY FOR SALTMARSH SURVIVAL. (C) 2020 ELSEVIER LTD.

SOM RETAINS WATER AND SOIL NUTRIENTS AND STORES MORE GLOBAL CARBON THAN DO PLANTS AND THE ATMOSPHERE COMBINED. SOM IS ALSO DECOMPOSED BY MICROBES, RETURNING CO2, A GREENHOUSE GAS, TO THE ATMOSPHERE. UNFORTUNATELY, SOIL CARBON STOCKS HAVE BEEN WIDELY LOST OR DEGRADED THROUGH LAND USE CHANGES AND UNSUSTAINABLE FOREST AND AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. TO UNDERSTAND ITS STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION AND TO MAINTAIN AND RESTORE SOM, WE NEED A BETTER APPRECIATION OF SOIL ORGANIC CARBON (SOC) SATURATION CAPACITY AND THE RETENTION OF ABOVE-AND BELOWGROUND INPUTS IN SOM. OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS ROOT INPUTS ARE APPROXIMATELY FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN AN EQUIVALENT MASS OF ABOVEGROUND LITTER TO BE STABILIZED AS SOM. MICROBES, PARTICULARLY FUNGI AND BACTERIA, AND SOIL FAUNAL FOOD WEBS STRONGLY INFLUENCE SOM DECOMPOSITION AT SHALLOWER DEPTHS, WHEREAS MINERAL ASSOCIATIONS DRIVE STABILIZATION AT DEPTHS GREATER THAN SIMILAR TO 30 CM. GLOBAL UNCERTAINTIES IN THE AMOUNTS AND LOCATIONS OF SOM INCLUDE THE EXTENT OF WETLAND, PEATLAND, AND PERMAFROST SYSTEMS AND FACTORS THAT CONSTRAIN SOIL DEPTHS, SUCH AS SHALLOW BEDROCK. IN CONSIDERATION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES, WE ESTIMATE GLOBAL SOC STOCKS AT DEPTHS OF 2 AND 3 M TO BE BETWEEN 2,270 AND 2,770 PG, RESPECTIVELY, BUT COULD BE AS MUCH AS 700 PG SMALLER. SEDIMENTARY DEPOSITS DEEPER THAN 3 M LIKELY CONTAIN >500 PG OF ADDITIONAL SOC. SOILS HOLD THE LARGEST BIOGEOCHEMICALLY ACTIVE TERRESTRIAL CARBON POOL ON EARTH AND ARE CRITICAL FOR STABILIZING ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATIONS. NONETHELESS, GLOBAL PRESSURES ON SOILS CONTINUE FROM CHANGES IN LAND MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE NEED FOR INCREASING BIOENERGY AND FOOD PRODUCTION.","THE ECOLOGY OF SOIL CARBON: POOLS, VULNERABILITIES, AND BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC CONTROLS","ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY, EVOLUTION, AND SYSTEMATICS, VOL 48","REVIEW; BOOK CHAPTER",NA,2017,"10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-112414-054234","ECOLOGY; EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY","WOS:000415250000019"

HOWEVER, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER THESE TEMPERATURE-DRIVEN TRENDS WILL CONTINUE, OR WHETHER OTHER FACTORS-FOR EXAMPLE, PHOTOPERIOD-WILL BECOME MORE IMPORTANT AS WARMING EXCEEDS THE BOUNDS OF HISTORICAL VARIABILITY(4,5). HERE WE USE PHENOLOGICAL TRANSITION DATES DERIVED FROM DIGITAL REPEAT(5) PHOTOGRAPHY(6) TO SHOW THAT EXPERIMENTAL WHOLE-ECOSYSTEM WARMING TREATMENTS(7) OF UP TO +9 DEGREES C LINEARLY CORRELATE WITH A DELAYED AUTUMN GREEN-DOWN AND ADVANCED SPRING GREEN-UP OF THE DOMINANT WOODY SPECIES IN A BOREAL PICEA-SPHAGNUM BOG. RESULTS WERE CONFIRMED BY DIRECT OBSERVATION OF BOTH VEGETATIVE AND REPRODUCTIVE PHENOLOGY OF THESE AND OTHER BOG PLANT SPECIES, AND BY MULTIPLE YEARS OF OBSERVATIONS. THERE WAS LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT THE OBSERVED RESPONSES WERE CONSTRAINED BY PHOTOPERIOD. OUR RESULTS INDICATE A LIKELY EXTENSION OF THE PERIOD OF VEGETATION ACTIVITY BY 1-2 WEEKS UNDER A 'CO2 STABILIZATION' CLIMATE SCENARIO (+2.6 +/- 0.7 DEGREES C), AND 3-6 WEEKS UNDER A 'HIGH-CO2 EMISSION' SCENARIO (+5.9 +/- 1.1 DEGREES C), BY THE END OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. WE ALSO OBSERVED SEVERE TISSUE MORTALITY IN THE WARMEST ENCLOSURES AFTER A SEVERE SPRING FROST EVENT. FAILURE TO CUE TO PHOTOPERIOD RESULTED IN PRECOCIOUS GREEN-UP AND A PREMATURE LOSS OF FROST HARDINESS(8), WHICH SUGGESTS THAT VULNERABILITY TO SPRING FROST DAMAGE WILL INCREASE IN A WARMER WORLD(9,10). VEGETATION STRATEGIES THAT HAVE EVOLVED TO BALANCE TRADEOFFS ASSOCIATED WITH PHENOLOGICAL TEMPERATURE TRACKING MAY BE OPTIMAL UNDER HISTORICAL CLIMATES, BUT THESE STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE OPTIMIZED FOR FUTURE CLIMATE REGIMES. THESE IN SITU EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ARE OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE BECAUSE BOREAL FORESTS HAVE BOTH A CIRCUMPOLAR DISTRIBUTION AND A KEY ROLE IN THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE(11).","ECOSYSTEM WARMING EXTENDS VEGETATION ACTIVITY BUT HEIGHTENS VULNERABILITY TO COLD TEMPERATURES","NATURE","ARTICLE","AUG 16",2018,"10.1038/s41586-018-0399-1","MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES","WOS:000441673400040"

OUR SYNTHESIS INCLUDES 47 RECORDS FROM A RECENTLY PUBLISHED DATABASE OF HIGHLY RESOLVED HOLOCENE PALEOCLIMATE TIME SERIES FROM THE ARCTIC (SUNDQVIST ET AL., 2014). WE ANALYZE THE TEMPERATURE HISTORIES REPRESENTED BY THE DATABASE AND COMPARE THEM WITH PALEOCLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION FROM 54 ADDITIONAL PUBLISHED RECORDS, MOSTLY FROM DATASETS THAT DID NOT FIT THE SELECTION CRITERIA FOR THE ARCTIC HOLOCENE DATABASE. COMBINED, WE REVIEW EVIDENCE FROM A VARIETY OF PROXY ARCHIVES INCLUDING GLACIERS (ICE CORES AND GLACIAL GEOMORPHOLOGY), LAKE SEDIMENTS, PEAT SEQUENCES, AND COASTAL AND DEEP-MARINE SEDIMENTS. THE TEMPERATURE-SENSITIVE RECORDS INDICATE MORE CONSISTENT AND EARLIER HOLOCENE WARMTH IN THE NORTH AND EAST, AND A MORE DIFFUSE AND LATER HOLOCENE THERMAL MAXIMUM IN THE SOUTH AND WEST. PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS REVEALS TWO DOMINANT HOLOCENE TRENDS, ONE WITH EARLY HOLOCENE WARMTH FOLLOWED BY COOLING IN THE MIDDLE HOLOCENE, THE OTHER WITH A BROADER PERIOD OF WARMTH IN THE MIDDLE HOLOCENE FOLLOWED BY COOLING IN THE LATE HOLOCENE.

WE ANALYSE MEASUREMENTS FROM ALL SITES WITHIN THE AUSTRALIAN PORTION OF THE OZFLUX NETWORK AND TWO SITES FROM NEW ZEALAND. THE RESPONSE OF THE AUSTRALIAN BIOMES TO CLIMATE WAS LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH GLOBAL STUDIES EXCEPT THAT AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMS HAD A LOWER ECOSYSTEM WATER-USE EFFICIENCY. AUSTRALIAN SEMI-ARID/ARID ECOSYSTEMS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THEIR HUGE EXTENT (70 %) AND THEY HAVE EVOLVED WITH COMMON MOISTURE LIMITATIONS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT AUSTRALIAN ECOSYSTEMS HAD A SIMILAR RADIATION-USE EFFICIENCY PER UNIT LEAF AREA COMPARED TO GLOBAL VALUES THAT INDICATES A CONVERGENCE TOWARD A SIMILAR BIOCHEMICAL EFFICIENCY.

TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF WARMING ON GHG DYNAMICS, WE DEPLOYED OPEN-TOP CHAMBERS IN A SUBARCTIC TUNDRA SITE IN NORTHEAST EUROPEAN RUSSIA. WE DETERMINED CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), METHANE (CH4), AND NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) FLUXES AS WELL AS THE CONCENTRATION OF THOSE GASES, INORGANIC NITROGEN (N) AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC) ALONG THE SOIL PROFILE. STUDIED TUNDRA SURFACES RANGED FROM MINERAL TO ORGANIC SOILS AND FROM VEGETATED TO UNVEGETATED AREAS. AS A RESULT OF AIR WARMING, THE SEASONAL GHG BUDGET OF THE VEGETATED TUNDRA SURFACES SHIFTED FROM A GHG SINK OF -300 TO -198 G CO2 -EQ M(-2) TO A SOURCE OF 105 TO 144 G CO2 -EQ M(-2). AT BARE PEAT SURFACES, WE OBSERVED INCREASED RELEASE OF ALL THREE GHGS. WHILE THE POSITIVE WARMING RESPONSE WAS DOMINATED BY CO2, WE PROVIDE HERE THE FIRST IN SITU EVIDENCE OF INCREASING N2O EMISSIONS FROM TUNDRA SOILS WITH WARMING. WARMING PROMOTED N2O RELEASE NOT ONLY FROM BARE PEAT, PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED AS A STRONG N2O SOURCE, BUT ALSO FROM THE ABUNDANT, VEGETATED PEAT SURFACES THAT DO NOT EMIT N2O UNDER PRESENT CLIMATE. AT THESE SURFACES, ELEVATED TEMPERATURES HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON PLANT GROWTH, RESULTING IN LOWER PLANT N UPTAKE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, BETTER N AVAILABILITY FOR SOIL MICROBES. ALTHOUGH THE WARMING WAS LIMITED TO THE SOIL SURFACE AND DID NOT ALTER THAW DEPTH, IT INCREASED CONCENTRATIONS OF DOC, CO2, AND CH4 IN THE SOIL DOWN TO THE PERMAFROST TABLE. THIS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO DOWNWARD DOC LEACHING, FUELING MICROBIAL ACTIVITY AT DEPTH. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR RESULTS EMPHASIZE THE TIGHT LINKAGES BETWEEN PLANT AND SOIL PROCESSES, AND DIFFERENT SOIL LAYERS, WHICH NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN PREDICTING THE CLIMATE CHANGE FEEDBACK OF THE ARCTIC.","WARMING OF SUBARCTIC TUNDRA INCREASES EMISSIONS OF ALL THREE IMPORTANT GREENHOUSE GASES - CARBON DIOXIDE, METHANE, AND NITROUS OXIDE","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","ARTICLE","AUG",2017,"10.1111/gcb.13563","BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000404863300015"

AS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT ANTHROPOGENIC GREENHOUSE GAS IN THE ATMOSPHERE AFTER CO2, CH4 IS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE FEEDBACKS. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE PAUCITY OF DATA, WETLAND CH4 FEEDBACKS WERE NOT FULLY ASSESSED IN THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE FIFTH ASSESSMENT REPORT. THE DEGREE TO WHICH FUTURE EXPANSION OF WETLANDS AND CH4 EMISSIONS WILL EVOLVE AND CONSEQUENTLY DRIVE CLIMATE FEEDBACKS IS THUS A QUESTION OF MAJOR CONCERN. HERE WE PRESENT AN ENSEMBLE ESTIMATE OF WETLAND CH4 EMISSIONS DRIVEN BY 38 GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY. WE FIND THAT CLIMATE CHANGE-INDUCED INCREASES IN BOREAL WETLAND EXTENT AND TEMPERATURE-DRIVEN INCREASES IN TROPICAL CH4 EMISSIONS WILL DOMINATE ANTHROPOGENIC CH4 EMISSIONS BY 38 TO 56% TOWARD THE END OF THE 21ST CENTURY UNDER THE REPRESENTATIVE CONCENTRATION PATHWAY (RCP2.6). DEPENDING ON SCENARIOS, WETLAND CH4 FEEDBACKS TRANSLATE TO AN INCREASE IN ADDITIONAL GLOBAL MEAN RADIATIVE FORCING OF 0.04W.M(-2) TO 0.19W.M(-2) BY THE END OF THE 21ST CENTURY. UNDER THE ""WORST-CASE"" RCP8.5 SCENARIO, WITH NO CLIMATE MITIGATION, BOREAL CH4 EMISSIONS ARE ENHANCED BY 18.05 TG TO 41.69 TG, DUE TO THAWING OF INUNDATED AREAS DURING THE COLD SEASON (DECEMBER TO MAY) AND RISING TEMPERATURE, WHILE TROPICAL CH4 EMISSIONS ACCELERATE WITH A TOTAL INCREMENT OF 48.36 TG TO 87.37 TG BY 2099.

THIS REVIEW SUMMARIZES AVAILABLE INFORMATION FROM DIVERSE HOLOCENE PALEOENVIRONMENTAL RECORDS ACROSS EASTERN BERINGIA (ALASKA, WESTERNMOST CANADA AND ADJACENT SEAS), AND IT QUANTIFIES THE PRIMARY TRENDS OF TEMPERATURE- AND MOISTURE-SENSITIVE RECORDS BASED IN PART ON MIDGES, POLLEN, AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL INDICATORS (COMPILED IN THE RECENTLY PUBLISHED ARCTIC HOLOCENE DATABASE, AND UPDATED HERE TO V2.1). THE COMPOSITE TIME SERIES FROM THESE PROXY RECORDS ARE COMPARED WITH NEW SUMMARIES OF MOUNTAIN-GLACIER AND LAKE-LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS, TERRESTRIAL WATER-ISOTOPE RECORDS, SEA-ICE AND SEA-SURFACE-TEMPERATURE ANALYSES, AND PEATLAND AND THAW-LAKE INITIATION FREQUENCIES TO CLARIFY MULTI-CENTENNIAL- TO MILLENNIAL-SCALE TRENDS IN HOLOCENE CLIMATE CHANGE. TO FOCUS THE SYNTHESIS, THE PALEO DATA ARE USED TO FRAME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED WITH SIMULATIONS BY EARTH SYSTEM MODELS TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSES AND DYNAMICS OF PAST AND FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW SHOWS THAT, DURING THE EARLY HOLOCENE (11.7-8.2 KA; 1 KA = 1000 CAL YR BP), RATHER THAN A PROMINENT THERMAL MAXIMUM AS SUGGESTED PREVIOUSLY, TEMPERATURES WERE HIGHLY VARIABLE, AT TIMES BOTH HIGHER AND LOWER THAN PRESENT (APPROXIMATE MID-20TH-CENTURY AVERAGE), WITH NO CLEAR SPATIAL PATTERN. COMPOSITED POLLEN, MIDGE AND OTHER PROXY RECORDS AVERAGE OUT THE VARIABILITY AND SHOW THE OVERALL LOWEST SUMMER AND MEAN-ANNUAL TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE STUDY REGION DURING THE EARLIEST HOLOCENE, FOLLOWED BY WARMING OVER THE EARLY HOLOCENE. THE SPARSE DATA AVAILABLE ON EARLY HOLOCENE GLACIATION SHOW THAT GLACIERS IN SOUTHERN ALASKA WERE AS EXTENSIVE THEN AS THEY WERE DURING THE LATE HOLOCENE. EARLY HOLOCENE LAKE LEVELS WERE LOW IN INTERIOR ALASKA, BUT MOISTURE INDICATORS SHOW PRONOUNCED DIFFERENCES ACROSS THE REGION. THE HIGHEST FREQUENCY OF BOTH PEATLAND AND THAW-LAKE INITIATION AGES ALSO OCCURRED DURING THE EARLY HOLOCENE. DURING THE MIDDLE HOLOCENE (8.2-4.2 KA), GLACIERS RETREATED AS THE REGIONAL AVERAGE TEMPERATURE INCREASED TO A MAXIMUM BETWEEN 7 AND 5 KA, AS REFLECTED IN MOST PROXY TYPES. FOLLOWING THE MIDDLE HOLOCENE THERMAL MAXIMUM, TEMPERATURES DECREASED STARTING BETWEEN 4 AND 3 KA, SIGNALING THE ONSET OF NEOGLACIAL COOLING. GLACIERS IN THE BROOKS AND ALASKA RANGES ADVANCED TO THEIR MAXIMUM HOLOCENE EXTENT AS LAKES GENERALLY ROSE TO MODERN LEVELS. TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCES FOR AVERAGED 500-YEAR TIME STEPS TYPICALLY RANGED BY 1-2 DEGREES C FOR INDIVIDUAL RECORDS IN THE ARCTIC HOLOCENE DATABASE, WITH A TRANSITION TO A COOLER LATE HOLOCENE THAT WAS NEITHER ABRUPT NOR SPATIALLY COHERENT. THE LONGEST AND HIGHEST-RESOLUTION TERRESTRIAL WATER ISOTOPE RECORDS PREVIOUSLY INTERPRETED TO REPRESENT CHANGES IN THE ALEUTIAN LOW-PRESSURE SYSTEM AROUND THIS TIME ARE HERE SHOWN TO BE LARGELY CONTRADICTORY. FURTHERMORE, THERE ARE TOO FEW RECORDS WITH SUFFICIENT RESOLUTION TO IDENTIFY SUB-CENTENNIAL-SCALE CLIMATE ANOMALIES, SUCH AS THE 8.2 KA EVENT.

WE INVESTIGATED PLANT-SOIL INTERACTIONS IN MARSHES AND ACROSS MANGROVE FOREST STRUCTURAL GRADIENTS IN THREE LOCATIONS IN THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO (USA). WE COMPARED OUR RESULTS TO THOSE FROM TERRESTRIAL GRASSLANDS WHERE THE EFFECTS OF WOODY PLANT ENCROACHMENT ARE OFTEN INFLUENCED BY RAINFALL AND PLANT TRAITS. ABIOTIC CONDITIONS AT OUR STUDY LOCATIONS DIFFERED, PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES RELATED TO PRECIPITATION. MARSH SPECIES COMPOSITION, MARSH ABOVE-GROUND BIOMASS, AND MANGROVE FOREST STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY ALSO VARIED ACROSS THESE LOCATIONS. MARSHES IN THE DRIEST LOCATION (CENTRAL TEXAS) HAD HIGHER SALINITIES AND WERE DOMINATED BY LOW BIOMASS SUCCULENT PLANTS AND LOWER SOIL CARBON POOLS. MARSHES IN THE WETTER, LESS SALINE LOCATIONS (LOUISIANA AND NORTH FLORIDA) CONTAINED HIGH BIOMASS GRASSES AND HIGHER SOIL CARBON POOLS. AT ALL LOCATIONS, ABOVE-GROUND BIOMASS AND ABOVE-GROUND CARBON POOLS WERE HIGHER IN MANGROVES THAN MARSHES; HOWEVER, BELOW-GROUND SOIL CARBON POOLS WERE ONLY HIGHER IN MANGROVES THAN MARSHES IN THE DRIEST LOCATION.

WARMING HAS ALREADY BEEN SHOWN TO PROMOTE ANCIENT PEATLAND CARBON RELEASE, BUT, DESPITE THE KEY ROLE OF VEGETATION IN CARBON DYNAMICS, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW PLANTS INFLUENCE THE SOURCE OF PEATLAND ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION. HERE, WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE USING INSITU(14)C MEASUREMENTS OF ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION ON AN ESTABLISHED PEATLAND WARMING AND VEGETATION MANIPULATION EXPERIMENT. RESULTS SHOW THAT WARMING OF APPROXIMATELY 1 DEGREES C PROMOTES RESPIRATION OF ANCIENT PEATLAND CARBON (UP TO 2100YEARS OLD) WHEN DWARF-SHRUBS OR GRAMINOIDS ARE PRESENT, AN EFFECT NOT OBSERVED WHEN ONLY BRYOPHYTES ARE PRESENT. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT WARMING LIKELY PROMOTES ANCIENT PEATLAND CARBON RELEASE VIA ITS CONTROL OVER ORGANIC INPUTS FROM VASCULAR PLANTS. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT DWARF-SHRUBS AND GRAMINOIDS PRIME MICROBIAL DECOMPOSITION OF PREVIOUSLY LOCKED-UP' ORGANIC MATTER FROM POTENTIALLY DEEP IN THE PEAT PROFILE, FACILITATING LIBERATION OF ANCIENT CARBON AS CO2. FURTHERMORE, SUCH PLANT-INDUCED PEAT RESPIRATION COULD CONTRIBUTE UP TO 40% OF ECOSYSTEM CO2 EMISSIONS.

IN THIS STUDY WE COMBINE FIELD OBSERVATIONS FROM A SUBARCTIC FEN IN THE SPORADIC PERMAFROST ZONE WITH NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF COUPLED WATER AND THERMAL FLUXES. AT THE TAVVAVUOMA STUDY SITE IN NORTHERN SWEDEN, GROUND TEMPERATURE PROFILES AND GROUNDWATER LEVELS WERE OBSERVED IN BOREHOLES.

TWO-DIMENSIONAL SCENARIOS REPRESENTING THE FEN UNDER VARIOUS HYDRAULIC GRADIENTS WERE DEVELOPED TO QUANTIFY THE INFLUENCE OF GROUNDWATER FLOW ON GROUND TEMPERATURE.

SYNCHRONOUS WITH THESE DRIER CONDITIONS, LEAF WAX DELTA C-13 VALUES SHOW LARGE NEGATIVE EXCURSIONS, WITH THE UTILIZATION OF CO2 RESPIRED FROM THE PEATLAND SUBSURFACE FOR PLANT PHOTOSYNTHESIS BEING A POSSIBLE MECHANISM. CRUCIALLY, SUCCESSIVE DRYING EVENTS APPEAR TO HAVE HAD A CUMULATIVE IMPACT ON THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF PEAT CARBON STORES TO CLIMATE CHANGE. CONCURRENTLY, BACTERIALLY DERIVED HOPANE DELTA C-13 VALUES SUGGEST THE OCCURRENCE OF ENHANCED METHANE OXIDATION DURING THE DRIER PERIODS.

FIRST, WE USED A COMBINATION OF FIELD MEASUREMENTS AND LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF INCREASED TEMPERATURE AND FLOODING ON CO2 AND CH4 EMISSIONS FROM SIXTEEN PERMAFROST PEATLANDS IN SUBARCTIC SWEDEN AND CANADA. SECOND, WE DETERMINED THE VARIATION IN ORGANIC MATTER CHEMISTRY AND THE ASSOCIATED MICROBIAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OF THE PEAT ACTIVE LAYER, WITH DEPTH USING QUANTITATIVE C-13 SOLID-STATE NMR AND MOLECULAR BIOMARKERS RESPECTIVELY. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PEAT ORGANIC CHEMISTRY STRONGLY CONTROLS CO2 RELEASE FROM PEAT AND THAT CA. 35 AND 26% OF THE PEAT ORGANIC MATTER, AT THE SWEDISH AND CANADIAN PEATLANDS SITES, RESPECTIVELY, IS EASILY DEGRADABLE BY HETEROTROPHIC MICROORGANISMS. IN CONTRAST TO CO2, CH4 EMISSIONS WERE DECOUPLED FROM PEAT FUNCTIONAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY. WE SHOW A STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND THE PEAT ORGANIC CHEMISTRY SUGGESTING THAT SUBSTRATE TYPE AND ABUNDANCE IS AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF MICROBIAL COMPOSITION IN SUB-ARCTIC PEATLANDS.

THE RESULTS SHOWED A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CO2 EMISSION AND DOC CONCENTRATION. FOR SINGLE FACTOR EFFECT, WE FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WATER TABLE AND CO2 EMISSION OR DOC CONCENTRATION. HOWEVER, TEMPERATURE AT 5 CM DEPTH WAS FOUND TO HAVE POSITIVE LINEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH CO2 EMISSION AND DOC CONCENTRATION. THE COMBINED EFFECT OF SOIL WARMING AND RAINFALL REDUCTION INCREASED CO2 EMISSION BY. 96.8%. IT SUGGESTED THAT THE DRYING AND WARMING COULD STIMULATE POTENTIAL EMISSION OF CO2. EXTENDING THIS RESULT TO THE ENTIRE PEATLAND AREA IN ZOIGE PLATEAU TRANSLATES INTO 0.45 TG CO2 EMISSION PER YEAR OVER A GROWING SEASON.

THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A NEW VERSION OF JULES (VN4.3_ PERMAFROST) IN WHICH THE SOIL VERTICAL DIMENSION IS ADDED TO THE SOIL CARBON MODEL, WITH A SET OF FOUR POOLS IN EVERY SOIL LAYER. THE RESPIRATION RATE IN EACH SOIL LAYER DEPENDS ON THE TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE CONDITIONS IN THAT LAYER.

THE LITTER INPUTS AND THE SOIL RESPIRATION ARE BOTH PARAMETRIZED TO DECREASE WITH INCREASING DEPTH. THE MODEL NOW INCLUDES A TRACER SO THAT SELECTED SOIL CARBON CAN BE LABELLED AND TRACKED THROUGH A SIMULATION. SIMULATIONS SHOW AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE LARGE-SCALE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF SOIL CARBON OVER THE STANDARD VERSION OF JULES (VN4.3). LIKE THE STANDARD VERSION OF JULES, THE VERTICALLY DISCRETIZED MODEL IS STILL UNABLE TO SIMULATE ENOUGH SOIL CARBON IN THE TUNDRA REGIONS.

IN COMPARISON WITH THE STANDARD MODEL, THE VERTICALLY DISCRETIZED MODEL SHOWS A DELAY IN THE ONSET OF SOIL RESPIRATION IN THE SPRING, RESULTING IN AN INCREASED NET UPTAKE OF CARBON DURING THIS TIME.

HOWEVER, DROUGHT IS AN ELUSIVE PHENOMENON THAT IS DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY AND DEFINE UNIVERSALLY. IN THIS STUDY, WE ASSESSED THE PERFORMANCE OF A SET OF INDICATORS THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO DESCRIBE DROUGHT CONDITIONS IN THE SUMMER MONTHS (JUNE, JULY, AUGUST) OVER A 30-YEAR PERIOD (1981-2010) IN FINLAND. THOSE INDICATORS INCLUDE THE STANDARDIZED PRECIPITATION INDEX (SPI), THE STANDARDIZED PRECIPITATION-EVAPOTRANSPIRATION INDEX (SPEI), THE SOIL MOISTURE INDEX (SMI), AND THE SOIL MOISTURE ANOMALY (SMA). HEREIN, REGIONAL SOIL MOISTURE WAS PRODUCED BY THE LAND SURFACE MODEL JSBACH OF THE MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGY EARTH SYSTEM MODEL (MPI-ESM). RESULTS SHOW THAT THE BUFFERING EFFECT OF SOIL MOISTURE AND THE ASSOCIATED SOIL MOISTURE MEMORY CAN IMPACT ON THE ONSET AND DURATION OF DROUGHT AS INDICATED BY THE SMI AND SMA, WHILE THE SPI AND SPEI ARE DIRECTLY CONTROLLED BY METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. IN PARTICULAR, WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER THE SMI, SMA AND SPEI ARE ABLE TO INDICATE THE EXTREME DROUGHT AFFECTING FOREST HEALTH (EDF), WHICH WE DEFINED ACCORDING TO THE EXTREME DROUGHT THAT CAUSED SEVERE FOREST DAMAGES IN FINLAND IN 2006. THE EDF THRESHOLDS FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED INDICATORS ARE SUGGESTED, BASED ON THE REPORTED STATISTICS OF FOREST DAMAGES IN FINLAND IN 2006. SMI WAS FOUND TO BE THE BEST INDICATOR IN CAPTURING THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF FOREST DAMAGE INDUCED BY THE EXTREME DROUGHT IN 2006. IN ADDITION, THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF THE EDF THRESHOLDS OVER THE SUMMER MONTHS OF THE 30-YEAR STUDY PERIOD, THE SPEI AND SMA TENDED TO SHOW MORE FREQUENT EDF EVENTS AND A HIGHER FRACTION OF INFLUENCED AREA THAN SMI. THIS IS BECAUSE THE SPEI AND SMA ARE STANDARDIZED INDICATORS THAT SHOW THE DEGREE OF ANOMALIES FROM STATISTICAL MEANS OVER THE AGGREGATION PERIOD OF CLIMATE CONDITIONS AND SOIL MOISTURE, RESPECTIVELY. HOWEVER, IN BOREAL FORESTS IN FINLAND, THE HIGH INITIAL SOIL MOISTURE OR EXISTENCE OF PEAT OFTEN PREVENT THE EDFS INDICATED BY THE SPEI AND SMA TO PRODUCE VERY LOW SOIL MOISTURE THAT COULD BE INDICATED AS EDFS BY THE SMI. THEREFORE, WE CONSIDER SMI IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR INDICATING EDFS IN BOREAL FORESTS. THE SELECTED EDF THRESHOLDS FOR THOSE INDICATORS COULD BE CALIBRATED WHEN THERE ARE MORE FOREST HEALTH OBSERVATION DATA AVAILABLE. FURTHERMORE, IN THE CONTEXT OF FUTURE CLIMATE SCENARIOS, ASSESSMENTS OF EDF RISKS IN NORTHERN AREAS SHOULD, IN ADDITION TO CLIMATE DATA, RELY ON A LAND SURFACE MODEL CAPABLE OF RELIABLE PREDICTION OF SOIL MOISTURE.","ASSESSING VARIOUS DROUGHT INDICATORS IN REPRESENTING SUMMER DROUGHT IN BOREAL FORESTS IN FINLAND","HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES","ARTICLE",NA,2016,"10.5194/hess-20-175-2016","GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY; WATER RESOURCES","WOS:000369668400012"

BOTH CATCHMENTS WERE LOCATED IN THE DISCONTINUOUS PERMAFROST ZONE OF BOREAL WESTERN CANADA AND HAD SIMILAR TO 60% PEATLAND COVER. THE TWO CATCHMENTS HAD STRONG SIMILARITIES IN THE TIMING OF DOC AND NUTRIENT YIELDS, BUT A FEW DIFFERENCES WERE CONSISTENT WITH ANTICIPATED EFFECTS OF WILDFIRE BASED ON PEATLAND POREWATER ANALYSIS. THE 4-WEEK SPRING PERIOD, PARTICULARLY THE RISING LIMB OF THE SPRING FRESHET, WAS CRUCIAL FOR ACCURATE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SEASONAL SOLUTE YIELD FROM BOTH CATCHMENTS. THE SPRING PERIOD WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SIMILAR TO 65% OF THE SEASONAL DOC AND NITROGEN AND FOR SIMILAR TO 85% OF THE PHOSPHOROUS YIELD.

ONE SOURCE OF DOM TO GROUNDWATER IS FROM THE TRANSPORT OF ORGANIC MATTER FROM THE VADOSE ZONE BY RAINFALL RECHARGE. CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION PATTERNS ASSOCIATED WITH NATURAL CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE ARE EXPECTED TO ALTER THE LOAD AND CHARACTER OF ORGANIC MATTER RELEASED FROM THESE AREAS, WHICH ULTIMATELY IMPACTS ON GROUNDWATER QUALITY AND DOM TREATABILITY. IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN GROUNDWATER DOM CHARACTER AFTER RAINFALL RECHARGE, WE SAMPLED SHALLOW GROUNDWATER FROM A COASTAL PEAT-RICH SAND AQUIFER IN NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA, DURING AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF LOW PRECIPITATION (AVERAGE DAILY PRECIPITATION RATE < 1.6 MM DAY(-1) OVER THE 8 MONTHS PRIOR TO SAMPLING), AND AFTER TWO HEAVY PRECIPITATION EVENTS (84 MM DAY(-1) AND 98 MM DAY(-1) RESPECTIVELY). WE ASSESS CHANGES IN DOM COMPOSITION AFTER CORRECTING FOR DILUTION BY A NOVEL COMBINATION OF TWO ADVANCED ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES: LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY ORGANIC CARBON DETECTION (LC-OCD) AND NEGATIVE-ION ELECTROSPRAY IONIZATION FOURIER TRANSFORM ION CYCLOTRON RESONANCE MASS SPECTROMETRY (FT-ICR MS). WE ALSO ASSESS CHANGES IN WATER CHEMISTRY PRE- AND POST-RAINFALL. POST-RAINFALL, WE SHOW THAT THE DILUTION-CORRECTED AMOUNT OF HIGHLY AROMATIC DOM MOLECULAR FORMULAE (I.E. THOSE CATEGORISED INTO THE GROUPS POLYPHENOLICS AND CONDENSED AROMATICS) WERE 1.7 AND 2.0 TIMES HIGHER RESPECTIVELY THAN IN PRE-RAINFALL SAMPLES. WE ATTRIBUTE THIS TO THE FLUSHING OF PEAT-DERIVED DOM FROM BURIED ORGANIC MATERIAL INTO THE GROUNDWATER. WE ALSO IDENTIFY THAT PERIODS OF LOW PRECIPITATION CAN LEAD TO LOW HYDROPHILIC/HOC RATIOS IN GROUNDWATER (MEDIAN = 4.9, N = 14). REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS (RDA) WAS USED TO COMPARE THE HOC FRACTION WITH FT-ICR MS COMPOUND GROUPS. WE SHOW THAT HOC HAS A MORE AROMATIC CHARACTER IN PRE-RAINFALL SAMPLES, AND IS LESS SIMILAR TO THE AROMATIC GROUPS IN POST-RAINFALL SAMPLES. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE DECLINE IN WATER-BORNE HYDROPHOBICS OBSERVED POST-RAINFALL COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH PREFERENTIAL ADSORPTION OF THE HYDROPHOBIC AROMATIC DOM, MAKING POST-RAINFALL SAMPLES LESS TREATABLE FOR POTABLE WATER SUPPLY. POST-RAINFALL WE ALSO OBSERVE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN ARSENIC (LEADING TO CONCENTRATIONS GREATER THAN 3 TIMES THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION DRINKING WATER LIMIT OF 10 MU G/ L). INCREASES IN COASTAL RAINFALL DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE MAY THEREFORE ALTER THE COMPOSITION OF GROUNDWATER DOM IN COASTAL PEATLAND AREAS IN WAYS THAT MAY IMPACT DOM BIOAVAILABILITY, AND INCREASE ARSENIC CONCENTRATIONS, REDUCING THE EASE OF WATER TREATMENT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.

THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT PLANT ASSEMBLAGES AT BLB, INCLUDING A FOREST DOMINATED BY TREES AND A BOG SHORELINE COMPOSED OF SHRUBS, WOODY GROUNDCOVER, HERBS AND GRAMINOIDS. N-ALKANE CONCENTRATIONS IN TREES WERE 10-300 TIMES HIGHER THAN IN SHORELINE PLANTS, WHILE N-ALKANOIC ACID CONCENTRATIONS WERE GENERALLY LOWER AND COMPARABLE ACROSS ALL SPECIES. THE OVERALL RANGE OF WAX DELTA H-2 VALUES AMONG INDIVIDUAL PLANTS (77 PARTS PER THOUSAND FOR N-C-29 ALKANE AND 84 PARTS PER THOUSAND FOR N-C-28 ALKANOIC ACID) WAS LIKELY DRIVEN BY INTERSPECIES DIFFERENCES IN BIOSYNTHETIC DELTA H-2 FRACTIONATION AS WELL AS SOURCE WATER DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FOREST AND SHORELINE PLANTS. A CONSIDERABLY SMALLER RANGE OF DELTA H-2(WAX) VALUES IN THE BOG SEDIMENTS (9 PARTS PER THOUSAND FOR N-C-29 ALKANE AND 11 PARTS PER THOUSAND FOR N-C-28 ALKANOIC ACID) SUGGESTS THAT SEDIMENTS ARE EITHER BIASED TOWARD SPECIFIC PLANTS, OR THAT SIGNAL AVERAGING PROCESSES DURING OR AFTER DEPOSITION ARE CONSTANT. THE COMBINED DELTA H-2 AND DELTA C-13 SIGNATURES OF PLANT SOURCES AND SEDIMENTS INDICATE A SEDIMENT BIAS MAINLY TOWARD TREES, WITH CONTRIBUTIONS FROM WOODY SHRUBS AND GROUNDCOVER GROWING IN THE BOG SHORELINE. WITHIN TREES AND WOODY SHRUBS, WE OBSERVED DELTA H-2(WAX)-DELTA C-13(WAX) RELATIONSHIPS OF OPPOSITE SIGN FOR N-C-29 ALKANE AND N-C-28 ALKANOIC ACID, WHICH WE SPECULATE MAY REFLECT CONTRASTING SEASONAL TIMING OF SYNTHESIS AND PLANT METABOLIC STATUS BETWEEN COMPOUND CLASSES. THE NET APPARENT DELTA H-2 FRACTIONATION BETWEEN PRECIPITATION AND WAX (EPSILON(APP)) WAS APPROXIMATELY 30 PARTS PER THOUSAND LARGER FOR N-ALKANES (-133 PARTS PER THOUSAND) THAN FOR N-ALKANOIC ACIDS (-103 PARTS PER THOUSAND), BOTH AT THE PLANT LEVEL AND IN SEDIMENTS. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE SENSITIVITY OF SEDIMENTS IN A HYDROLOGICALLY CLOSED BASIN TO WOODY PLANTS GROWING IN THE ASSOCIATED CATCHMENT AND CAN GUIDE EPSILON(APP) ESTIMATES FOR SEDIMENTARY RECORDS FROM SIMILAR DEPOSITIONAL SETTINGS.

WE FOUND THAT SOILS RANGED FROM MINERAL SOILS IN BARE SOIL AND LICHEN TUNDRA LCTS TO SOILS OF HIGH PERCENTAGE OF ORGANIC MATTER (OM) IN GRAMINOID TUNDRA, BOG, DRY FEN AND WET FEN. OM CONTENT OF THE TOP SOIL WAS ON AVERAGE 14 G DM(-3) IN BARE SOIL AND LICHEN TUNDRA AND 89 G DM(-3) IN OTHER LCTS. TOTAL MOSS BIOMASS VARIED FROM 0 TO 820 GM(-2), TOTAL VASCULAR SHOOT MASS FROM 7 TO 112 GM(-2) AND VASCULAR LEAF AREA INDEX (LAI) FROM 0.04 TO 0.95 AMONG LCTS. IN LATE SUMMER, SOIL TEMPERATURES AT 15 CM DEPTH WERE ON AVERAGE 14 DEGREES C IN BARE SOIL AND LICHEN TUNDRA, AND VARIED FROM 5 TO 9 DEGREES C IN OTHER LCTS. ON AVERAGE, DEPTH OF THE BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE, UNFROZEN SOIL LAYER DOUBLED FROM EARLY JULY TO MID-AUGUST. WHEN CONTRASTED ACROSS STUDY PLOTS, MOSS BIOMASS WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH SOIL OM % AND OM CONTENT AND NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH SOIL TEMPERATURE, EXPLAINING 14-34% OF VARIATION. VASCULAR SHOOT MASS AND LAI WERE ALSO POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH SOIL OM CONTENT, AND LAI WITH ACTIVE LAYER DEPTH, BUT ONLY EXPLAINED 6-15% OF VARIATION. NDVI CAPTURED VARIATION IN VASCULAR LAI BETTER THAN IN MOSS BIOMASS, BUT WHILE THIS DIFFERENCE WAS SIGNIFICANT WITH LATE SEASON NDVI, IT WAS MINIMAL WITH EARLY SEASON NDVI. FOR THIS REASON, SOIL ATTRIBUTES ASSOCIATED WITH MOSS MASS WERE BETTER CAPTURED BY EARLY SEASON NDVI. TOPOGRAPHIC ATTRIBUTES WERE RELATED TO LAI AND MANY SOIL ATTRIBUTES, BUT NOT TO MOSS BIOMASS AND COULD NOT INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SPATIAL VARIATION EXPLAINED IN PLANT AND SOIL ATTRIBUTES ABOVE THAT ACHIEVED BY NDVI.

EXPERIMENTAL WATER LEVEL DRAW-DOWN (WLD) SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED GROSS PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION. WARMING ALONE HAD INSIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON THE CO2 EXCHANGE COMPONENTS, BUT WHEN COMBINED WITH WLD IT FURTHER INCREASED ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION. IN THE SOUTHERN FEN, CO2 UPTAKE DECREASED DUE TO WLD, WHICH WAS AMPLIFIED BY WARMING, WHILE AT NORTHERN FEN IT REMAINED STABLE.

OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT ELEVATED TEMPERATURE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SOIL CARBON MINERALIZATION. THE Q(10) VALUES OF THE CARBON MINERALIZATION RATES IN THE SHALLOW SOIL AND DEEP SOIL WERE 3.95 AND 2.91, RESPECTIVELY. IN CONTRAST, THE SOIL MBC AND DOC DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, CONFIRMING THAT LABILE CARBON IS THE MAIN DRIVING FORCE OF MICROBIAL MINERALIZATION ACTIVITIES UNDER WARMING CONDITIONS. ELEVATED TEMPERATURE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE SHALLOW SOIL NET N MINERALIZATION RATES AND INCREASED THE NET NITRIFICATION RATES IN BOTH SOIL LAYERS. AT HIGH TEMPERATURES, AMMONIFICATION RATES INCREASED IN THE SHALLOW SOIL BUT DECREASED IN THE DEEP SOIL. THE INCREASE IN THE INCUBATION TEMPERATURE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SHALLOW SOIL BETA-GLUCOSIDASE ACTIVITY AND DECREASED INVERTASE ACTIVITY. THIS SUGGESTS THE INCREASED PRODUCTION OF COMPLEX SUBSTRATE ENZYMES, AND DECREASED PRODUCTION OF SIMPLE SUBSTRATE-ACQUIRING ENZYMES. THE ROOT ADDITIONS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE SOIL C MINERALIZATION AND STIMULATED THE SECRETION OF INVERTASE BY SOIL MICROORGANISMS. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT FUTURE CLIMATE WARMING IN THE NORTHERN HIGH LATITUDE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY STIMULATE SOIL CARBON AND NITROGEN MINERALIZATION IN PERMAFROST PEATLANDS. FURTHERMORE, INCREASES IN PLANT ROOTS WILL ENHANCE C ACCUMULATION AND MAY EVEN ENHANCE THE RESPONSE OF SOIL C MINERALIZATION TO TEMPERATURE, SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE SOIL C BALANCE IN HIGH LATITUDE PERMAFROST PEATLANDS.","EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE AND ROOT ADDITIONS ON SOIL CARBON AND NITROGEN MINERALIZATION IN A PREDOMINANTLY PERMAFROST PEATLAND","CATENA","ARTICLE","JUN",2018,"10.1016/j.catena.2018.02.026","GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY; SOIL SCIENCE; WATER RESOURCES","WOS:000430994900037"

THIS HAS POSED SERIOUS THREATS TO THE WATER RESOURCES, SUSTAINABLE GOODS PRODUCTION AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THAT DEPEND ON REGIONAL WATER QUALITY. THEREFORE, PROPER WATERSHED MANAGEMENT IS IMPERATIVE. IN THIS PAPER, WE INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE IN A COLD CLIMATE WATER-SHED IN CENTRAL ALBERTA, CANADA WITH THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF QUANTIFYING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON WATER QUALITY STATUS. WE MODIFIED SPECIFIC WATER QUALITY RELATED PROCESSES OF A PROCESS-BASED MODEL - SOIL AND WATER ASSESSMENT TOOL (SWAT) WITH A VIEW OF BETTER REPRESENTING THE REALITY OF COLD CLIMATE REGIONS. A SWAT MODEL IS THEN BUILT-UP, FOLLOWED UP BY A MULTI-SITE AND MULTI-OBJECTIVE (STREAMFLOW, SEDIMENT AND WATER QUALITY) CALIBRATION, VALIDATION AND UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS IN A BASELINE PERIOD (1983 - 2013). THE CALIBRATED AND VALIDATED MODEL IS THEN FED WITH A HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION (25 KM) DAILY FUTURE CLIMATE DATA - THE CANRCM4. IMPROVEMENTS ON STREAM WATER TEMPERATURE (TS) AND DISSOLVED OXYGEN (DO) SIMULATIONS JUSTIFIED THE MODIFICATIONS. THIS MODEL IS ABLE TO SIMULATE THE DYNAMICS OF OTHER WATER QUALITY VARIABLES (CARBONACEOUS BIOCHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND - CBOD, TOTAL NITROGEN - TN AND PHOSPHORUS TP) WITH A WIDE RANGE OF ACCURACY (VERY GOOD TO SATISFACTORY) IN THE BASE PERIOD. AGRICULTURE AREAS ACCOUNT FOR THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF ANNUAL TN (11.16 KGN/HA) AND TP (2.88 KGP/HA) YIELD RATE IN THE BASE PERIOD LEADING TO POOR WATER QUALITY STATUS IN THE IMMEDIATE DOWNSTREAM REACHES. THE SITUATION WOULD BE FURTHER EXACERBATED (16.52 KGN/HA AND 4.89 KGP/HA) IN FUTURE. FINALLY, WE TESTED DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT OPTIONS TO COMPARE THE WATER QUALITY STATUS OF THE ATHABASCA RIVER BASIN (ARB) UNDER A CHANGING CLIMATE. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FUTURE NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS (SIMILAR TO 20% ON TN AND 60% ON TP) CAN BE ACHIEVED USING A CERTAIN COMBINATION OF MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND THE ECOLOGICAL STATUS OF THE BASIN CAN BE IMPROVED.

REPORTS OF MULTIPLE YEARS OF DATA FROM A SINGLE SITE WERE AVERAGED AND DIFFERENT MICROFORMS (E.G., HUMMOCK OR HOLLOW) WITHIN THESE PEATLAND TYPES WERE KEPT SEPARATE. A NEW PEATLANDS MAP WAS CREATED FROM FOREST COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE INFORMATION THAT DISTINGUISHES BOG FROM RICH AND POOR FEN. NATIONAL FOREST INVENTORY K-NN FOREST STRUCTURE MAPS, BIOCLIMATIC VARIABLES (MEAN DIURNAL RANGE AND SEASONALITY OF TEMPERATURES) AND GROUND SURFACE SLOPE WERE USED TO CONSTRUCT THE NEW MAP. THE EARTH OBSERVATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT MAP OF WETLANDS WAS USED TO IDENTIFY OPEN PEATLANDS WITH MINOR TREE COVER. RESULTS: THE NEW MAP WAS COMBINED WITH AVERAGES OF OBSERVED NEE AND CH4 EMISSIONS TO ESTIMATE A GROWING SEASON INTEGRATED NEE (+/- SE) AT - 108.8 (+/- 41.3) MT CO2 SEASON(-1) AND CH4 EMISSION AT 4.1 (+/- 1.5) MT CH4 SEASON(-1) FOR THE SEVEN ECOZONES. CONVERTING CH4 TO CO2 EQUIVALENT (CO2 E; GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL OF 25 OVER 100 YEARS) RESULTED IN A TOTAL NET SINK OF - 7.0 (+/- 77.6) MT CO2 E SEASON(-1) FOR CANADA. BOREAL PLAINS PEATLANDS CONTRIBUTED MOST TO THE NEE SINK DUE TO HIGH CO2 UPTAKE RATES AND LARGE PEATLAND AREAS, WHILE BOREAL SHIELD PEATLANDS CONTRIBUTED MOST TO CH4 EMISSIONS DUE TO MODERATE EMISSION RATES AND LARGE PEATLAND AREAS.

ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGISTS ARE CONTINUOUSLY ASSESSING HOW GLOBAL WARMING IS GOING TO IMPACT THE CURRENT POPULATION. PEATLANDS ARE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS WHICH MAKES ONLY 3% OF THEM BUT CONTAIN AROUND 40% OF SOIL ORGANIC CARBON. THE COMPOSITION OF PEATLAND VEGETATION IMPACTS A RANGE OF ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS, THEREFORE, WITH A CHANGE IN COMPOSITION, THE BEHAVIOR AND STRUCTURE OF PEATLAND PLANT COMMUNITIES ARE PREDICTED TO CHANGE. THIS WORK IS FOCUSED ON THE RESPONSE OF SPHAGNUM PEATLAND (IN POLAND), TO THE MANIPULATED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. THE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN CONSISTED OF FOUR TREATMENTS (CONTROL, WARMING, REDUCED PRECIPITATION, AND A COMBINATION OF WARMING & REDUCED PRECIPITATION), THREE REPLICATES OF EACH. ACTIVE WARMING WITH INFRARED HEATERS ((SIMILAR TO)1.0-1.4 DEGREES C PEAT TEMPERATURE INCREASE) AND AN AUTOMATIC CURTAIN TO REDUCE PRECIPITATION ((SIMILAR TO)30% REDUCTION IN THE RAIN) WAS APPLIED CONTINUOUSLY SINCE 2015. THE WARMING AND REDUCED PRECIPITATION CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN THE VEGETATION INDICES SUCH AS NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX (NDVI), PHOTOCHEMICAL REFLECTANCE INDEX (PRI), WATER BAND INDEX (WBI), AND CHLOROPHYLL GREEN INDEX (CIGREEN) BETWEEN MANIPULATED SITES. THE ABUNDANCE OF MAJOR PLANT SPECIES WAS RECORDED BETWEEN MANIPULATED SITES. THE PROMPT CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE MEASUREMENT WAS PERFORMED IN THE PEAK OF THE VEGETATION SEASON OF AUGUST 2017 WHICH HAD SHOWN A SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN PHOTOSYNTHETIC INDUCTION CURVE AND DIFFERENT PHOTOSYNTHETIC PARAMETERS FROM THE SAME PLANT SPECIES IN BETWEEN THE MANIPULATED SITES.

ARTHROPODS CAN SERVE AS STRONG INDICATORS OF ECOSYSTEM CHANGE DUE TO THEIR SENSITIVITY TO INCREASING TEMPERATURES AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES. WE USED SPIDER SAMPLES COLLECTED BY PITFALL TRAPPING FROM THREE DIFFERENT HABITATS (FEN, MESIC AND ARID HEATH) IN HIGH-ARCTIC GREENLAND TO ASSESS CHANGES IN INDIVIDUAL SPECIES ABUNDANCES OVER AN 18-YEAR PERIOD (1996-2014).

DIFFUSE ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES, SUCH AS MANURE AND FERTILISER USE AND ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION, ADD TO THE WATER QUALITY PROBLEMS IN THE POLDERS. THE MAJOR NUTRIENT SOURCES AND PATHWAYS HAVE NOT YET BEEN CLARIFIED DUE TO THE COMPLEX HYDROLOGICAL SYSTEM IN LOWLAND CATCHMENTS WITH BOTH URBAN AND AGRICULTURAL AREAS. IN THIS STUDY, THE SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF THE GROUNDWATER SEEPAGE IMPACT WAS IDENTIFIED BY EXPLOITING THE DENSE GROUNDWATER AND SURFACE WATER MONITORING NETWORKS IN AMSTERDAM AND ITS SURROUNDING POLDERS. A TOTAL OF 25 VARIABLES (CONCENTRATIONS OF TOTAL NITROGEN (TN), TOTAL PHOSPHORUS (TP), NH4, NO3, HCO3, SO4, CA, AND CL IN SURFACE WATER AND GROUNDWATER, N AND P AGRICULTURAL INPUTS, SEEPAGE RATE, ELEVATION, LAND-USE, AND SOIL TYPE) FOR 144 POLDERS WERE ANALYSED STATISTICALLY AND INTERPRETED IN RELATION TO SOURCES, TRANSPORT MECHANISMS, AND PATHWAYS. THE RESULTS IMPLY THAT GROUNDWATER IS A LARGE SOURCE OF NUTRIENTS IN THE GREATER AMSTERDAM MIXED URBAN-AGRICULTURAL CATCHMENTS. THE GROUNDWATER NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS EXCEEDED THE SURFACE WATER ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY STANDARDS (EQSS) IN 93% OF THE POLDERS FOR TP AND IN 91% FOR TN.

HIGH CORRELATIONS (R-2 UP TO 0.88) BETWEEN SOLUTES IN GROUNDWATER AND SURFACE WATER, TOGETHER WITH THE CLOSE SIMILARITIES IN THEIR SPATIAL PATTERNS, CONFIRMED THE LARGE IMPACT OF GROUNDWATER ON SURFACE WATER CHEMISTRY, ESPECIALLY IN THE POLDERS THAT HAVE HIGH SEEPAGE RATES.

THE LARGE LOADS OF NUTRIENT-RICH GROUNDWATER SEEPAGE INTO THE DEEPEST POLDERS INDIRECTLY AFFECT SURFACE WATER QUALITY IN THE SURROUNDING AREA, BECAUSE EXCESS WATER FROM THE DEEP POLDERS IS PUMPED OUT AND USED TO SUPPLY WATER TO THE SURROUNDING INFILTRATING POLDERS IN DRY PERIODS.

HUMAN ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES WITH TREMENDOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR CARBON (C) DYNAMICS. PEATLANDS ARE CRITICAL ECOSYSTEMS BECAUSE THEY STORE SIMILAR TO 30% OF THE GLOBAL SOIL ORGANIC C POOL AND ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO ANTHROPOGENIC CHANGES. THE ZOIGE PEATLAND ON THE EASTERN TIBET PLATEAU, AS THE LARGEST ALPINE PEATLAND IN THE WORLD, ACCOUNTS FOR 1 PARTS PER THOUSAND OF GLOBAL PEAT SOIL ORGANIC C STORAGE. HOWEVER, THIS PEATLAND HAS EXPERIENCED DRAMATIC CLIMATE CHANGE INCLUDING INCREASED TEMPERATURE AND REDUCED PRECIPITATION IN THE PAST DECADES, WHICH LIKELY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A DECLINE OF THE WATER-TABLE AND FACILITATED EARTHWORM INVASION, TWO MAJOR FACTORS REDUCING SOIL ORGANIC CARBON (SOC) STORAGE OF PEATLANDS. 2. BECAUSE EARTHWORMS OFTEN ARE MORE ACTIVE IN LOW-THAN IN HIGH-MOISTURE PEATLANDS, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE SIMULTANEOUS OCCURRENCE OF WATER-TABLE DECLINE AND EARTHWORM INVASION WOULD SYNERGISTICALLY ACCELERATE THE RELEASE OF SOC FROM PEATLAND SOIL. WE CONDUCTED A FIELD EXPERIMENT WITH A PAIRED SPLIT-PLOT DESIGN, I.E. PRESENCE VS. ABSENCE OF THE INVASIVE EARTHWORMS (PHERETIMA ASPERGILLUM) NESTED IN DRAINED VS. UNDRAINED PLOTS, RESPECTIVELY, FOR 3 YEARS WITHIN THE HOMOGENOUS ZOIGE PEATLAND. 3. WATER-TABLE DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED SOIL WATER CONTENT AND BULK DENSITY, RESULTING IN A MARKED REDUCTION OF SOC STORAGE. MOREOVER, CONSISTENT WITH OUR HYPOTHESIS, EARTHWORM PRESENCE DRAMATICALLY REDUCED SOC IN THE DRAINED BUT NOT IN THE UNDRAINED PEATLAND THROUGH THE FORMATION OF DEEP BURROWS AND DECREASING BULK DENSITY OF THE LOWER SOIL LAYER OVER 3 YEARS. THE VARIATION IN SOC LIKELY WAS DUE TO CHANGES IN ABOVE-GROUND PLANT BIOMASS, ROOT GROWTH AND EARTHWORM BEHAVIOUR INDUCED BY THE EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS. 4. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. WE SUGGEST THAT INCENTIVE MEASURES SHOULD BE TAKEN TO PREVENT FURTHER WATER-TABLE DECLINE AND EARTHWORM INVASION FOR MAINTAINING THE SOIL CARBON POOL IN ZOIGE PEATLAND. ARTIFICIAL FILLING OF DRAINAGE CANALS SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED TO INCREASE THE WATER-TABLE LEVEL, FACILITATING THE RECOVERY OF DRAINED PEATLANDS. MOREOVER, THE DISPERSAL OF EARTHWORMS AND THEIR COCOONS ATTACHED TO THE ROOTS OF CROP PLANTS AND TREE SAPLINGS FROM LOW-LYING AREAS TO THE ZOIGE REGION SHOULD BE PREVENTED.","SOIL DRAINAGE FACILITATES EARTHWORM INVASION AND SUBSEQUENT CARBON LOSS FROM PEATLAND SOIL","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","ARTICLE","OCT",2017,"10.1111/1365-2664.12894","BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; ECOLOGY","WOS:000410678700002"

HERE, WE SHOW THAT THE EFFECT OF CLIMATE WARMING ON SPHAGNUM COMMUNITY PHOTOSYNTHESIS TOGGLES FROM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE AS THE PEATLAND GOES FROM RAINY TO DRY PERIODS DURING SUMMER. MORE PARTICULARLY, WE SHOW THAT MECHANISMS OF COMPENSATION AMONG THE DOMINANT SPHAGNUM SPECIES (SPHAGNUM FALLAX AND SPHAGNUM MEDIUM) STABILIZE THE AVERAGE PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND PRODUCTIVITY OF THE SPHAGNUM COMMUNITY DURING SUMMER DESPITE RISING TEMPERATURES AND FREQUENT DROUGHTS. WHILE WARMING HAD A NEGLIGIBLE EFFECT ON S. MEDIUM PHOTOSYNTHETIC CAPACITY (A(MAX)) DURING RAINY PERIODS, A(MAX) OF S. FALLAX INCREASED BY 40%.

THE ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS OF LARGE-MAGNITUDE EXPLOSIVE ERUPTIONS ARE MORE PRONOUNCED WHEN THE ERUPTIONS OCCUR IN THE TROPICS DUE TO INCREASED AEROSOL DISPERSAL AND EFFECTS ON THE MERIDIONAL TEMPERATURE GRADIENT.

IN A PREVIOUS PAPER (OU ET AL. 2015), WE SHOWED THAT THE NEST MODEL CAN BE USED TO MODEL SOIL TEMPERATURES, FROZEN DEPTH, AND ACTIVE LAYER THICKNESS IN A WARM AND DISCONTINUOUS PERMAFROST AREA THAT IS LOCATED IN THE HUDSON BAY LOWLANDS IN NORTHERN ONTARIO, CANADA. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE APPLIED THE MODEL OVER THE WHOLE STUDY AREA TO MAP THE DISTRIBUTION OF PERMAFROST CONDITIONS AND THEIR CHANGES FROM THE 1960S TO THE 2000S AT HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION. SOME OF THE MODEL INPUTS WERE ESTIMATED BASED ON LAND-COVER AND SURFICIAL MATERIAL MAPS DERIVED FROM LANDSAT-5 TM AND RADARSAT-2 SAR C-HH AND C-HV IMAGES. BY COMPARISON TO FIELD OBSERVATIONS, WE WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE AN AVERAGE MAPPING ACCURACY OF 99% FOR BOTH THE LAND-COVER AND SURFICIAL MATERIAL MAPS, WHEN BOTH LANDSAT AND RADARSAT-2 IMAGES WERE USED. IN ADDITION, ALL THE 49 FIELD-OBSERVED TREED AND SHRUB PERMAFROST LANDFORM SITES FOUND IN THE STUDY AREA WERE CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED ON THE CLASSIFIED IMAGE.

FUTURE CARBON STORAGE IN THESE ECOSYSTEMS DEPENDS ON THE BALANCE BETWEEN MICROBIAL DECOMPOSITION AND PRIMARY PRODUCTION, BOTH OF WHICH CAN BE REGULATED BY NUTRIENTS SUCH AS PHOSPHORUS. PHOSPHORUS CYCLING IN TUNDRA AND BOREAL REGIONS IS OFTEN ASSUMED TO OCCUR THROUGH BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS WITH LITTLE INTERACTION WITH SOIL MINERALS; THAT IS, PHOSPHATE RELEASED FROM ORGANIC MOLECULES IS RAPIDLY ASSIMILATED BY PLANTS OR MICROORGANISMS. IN CONTRAST TO THIS PREVAILING CONCEPTUAL MODEL, WE USE SEQUENTIAL EXTRACTIONS AND SPECTROSCOPIC TECHNIQUES TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IRON (OXYHYDR)OXIDES SEQUESTER APPROXIMATELY HALF OF SOIL PHOSPHATE IN ORGANIC SOILS FROM FOUR ARCTIC AND BOREAL SITES. IRON (III) (OXYHYDR)OXIDES ACCUMULATED IN SHALLOW SOILS OF LOW-LYING, SATURATED AREAS WHERE CIRCUMNEUTRAL PH AND THE PRESENCE OF A REDOX INTERFACE PROMOTED IRON OXIDATION AND HYDROLYSIS. SOILS ENRICHED IN SHORT-RANGE ORDERED IRON OXYHYDROXIDES, WHICH ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DISSOLUTION UNDER ANOXIC CONDITIONS, HAD HIGH PHOSPHATE SORPTION CAPACITIES AND MAINTAINED LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF SOLUBLE PHOSPHATE RELATIVE TO SOILS CONTAINING MOSTLY ORGANIC-BOUND IRON OR CRYSTALLINE IRON OXIDES. THUS, SUBSTANTIAL QUANTITIES OF PHOSPHORUS IN THESE ORGANIC SOILS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH MINERALS THAT COULD REDUCE BIOAVAILABILITY BUT POTENTIALLY ALSO SERVE AS PHOSPHORUS SOURCES UNDER ANOXIC CONDITIONS.

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CUMULATIVE DEPARTURE FROM MEAN PRECIPITATION AND DI-SALINITY SUGGEST THAT PRECIPITATION MAY CONTROL SALINITY BOTH DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY. IN PONDS RECHARGED PREDOMINANTLY BY METEORIC WATER, PRECIPITATION MAY GOVERN SALINITY DIRECTLY BY DILUTION OF SALT CONTENT IN WATER, SO THAT RISES IN PRECIPITATION RESULT IN A SALINITY DECLINE. IN PONDS SITUATED WITHIN A SALINE GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE ZONE, SALINITY MAY BE INFLUENCED BY PRECIPITATION INDIRECTLY THROUGH RECHARGE OF THE SALINE AQUIFER, SO INCREASES IN PRECIPITATION LEAD TO RISES IN SALINITY.

HENCE, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR LONG-TERM IN SITU EXPERIMENTS ALLOWING FOR THE STUDY OF ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES OVER TIME SCALES RELEVANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. HERE WE PRESENT IN SITU CH4 AND CO2 FLUX MEASUREMENTS FROM A WET HEATH ECOSYSTEM IN NORTHERN SWEDEN SUBJECTED TO 16 YEARS OF MANIPULATIONS, INCLUDING SUMMER WARMING WITH OPEN-TOP CHAMBERS, BIRCH LEAF LITTER ADDITION, AND THE COMBINATION THEREOF. THROUGHOUT THE SNOW-FREE SEASON, THE ECOSYSTEM WAS A NET SINK OF CH4 AND CO2 (CH4 -0.27 MG C M(-2) D(-1); NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE -1827 MG C M(-2) D(-1)), WITH HIGHEST CH4 UPTAKE RATES (-0.70 MG C M(-2) D(-1)) DURING FALL. WARMING ENHANCED NET CO2 FLUX, WHILE NET CH4 FLUX WAS GOVERNED BY SOIL MOISTURE. LITTER ADDITION AND THE COMBINATION WITH WARMING SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED CH4 UPTAKE RATES, EXPLAINED BY A PRONOUNCED SOIL DRYING EFFECT OF UP TO 32% RELATIVE TO AMBIENT CONDITIONS. BOTH WARMING AND LITTER ADDITION ALSO INCREASED THE SEASONAL AVERAGE CONCENTRATION OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON IN THE SOIL. THE SITE WAS A CARBON SINK WITH A NET UPTAKE OF 60 G CM-2 OVER THE SNOW-FREE SEASON. HOWEVER, WARMING REDUCED NET CARBON UPTAKE BY 77%, SUGGESTING THAT THIS ECOSYSTEM TYPE MIGHT SHIFT FROM SNOW-FREE SEASON SINK TO SOURCE WITH INCREASING SUMMER TEMPERATURES. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: MUCH ATTENTION HAS BEEN DIRECTED TOWARD METHANE (CH4) DYNAMICS IN PEATLANDS AND WET ECOSYSTEMS AT HIGH LATITUDES, WHICH ARE CONSIDERED NET CH4 SOURCES WHICH INTENSIFY THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT AND LEAD TO FURTHER WARMING. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE HITHERTO INVESTIGATED CH4 FLUXES IN SUBARCTIC HEATH ECOSYSTEMS, WHICH LIKELY EXHIBIT BOTH CH4 PRODUCTION AND UPTAKE. THEREFORE, CLIMATE-INDUCED CHANGES IN CH4 EXCHANGE AND THE OVERALL CARBON BALANCE ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN. IN THIS UNIQUE LONG-TERM FIELD EXPERIMENT, WE INVESTIGATED THE RESPONSE OF BIOLOGICAL CH4 UPTAKE (MICROBIAL CH4 CONSUMPTION) TO INCREASED SUMMER WARMING BY OPEN-TOP CHAMBERS AND DECIDUOUS LEAF LITTER INPUT IN A WET HEATH ECOSYSTEM IN NORTHERN SWEDEN, REPRESENTATIVE OF A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE TUNDRA LANDSCAPE. WE FOUND THAT LEAF LITTER ADDITION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES CH4 UPTAKE RATES DUE TO A PRONOUNCED SOIL DRYING EFFECT, WHICH IS INTENSIFIED IN COMBINATION WITH WARMING. WARMING ENHANCES CO2 RELEASE, WHILE CH4 UPTAKE IS CONTROLLED BY SOIL MOISTURE. THE STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE SENSITIVITY AND CAPACITY OF A WET HEATH ECOSYSTEM TO FUNCTION AS A NET CH4 SINK.

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

THEIR MICROBIAL NETWORK STRUCTURE AND THEIR BIOMASS ARE CRUCIAL FOR PEATLAND CARBON CYCLING, THROUGH PRIMARY PRODUCTION, AS WELL AS DECOMPOSITION AND MINERALIZATION OF ORGANIC MATTER. WETLANDS ARE ONE OF THE ECOSYSTEMS MOST AT RISK FROM ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES AND CLIMATE CHANGE. MOST RECENT SCENARIOS OF CLIMATE CHANGE FOR CENTRAL EUROPE PREDICT AN INCREASE IN AIR TEMPERATURE AND A DECREASE IN ANNUAL PRECIPITATION. THESE CHANGES MAY DISTURB THE BIODIVERSITY OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS, AND THE PEAT CARBON SINK. CONSIDERING THE ABOVE CLIMATIC SCENARIOS, WE AIMED TO: I) ASSESS THE RESPONSE OF MICROBIAL COMMUNITY BIOMASS TO WARMING AND REDUCED PRECIPITATION THROUGH THE LENS OF A MANIPULATIVE EXPERIMENT IN A PEATLAND ECOSYSTEM II) PREDICT HOW GLOBAL WARMING MIGHT AFFECT MICROBIAL BIODIVERSITY ON PEATLANDS EXPOSED TO WARMER TEMPERATURES AND DECREASED PRECIPITATION CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, WE WANTED TO IDENTIFY ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS OF WARMING AMONG MICROORGANISMS LIVING IN SPHAGNUM PEATLAND.

HENCE, FORECASTING THE INFLUENCE OF FUTURE CLIMATE OR SPATIALLY-DISTRIBUTED MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS ON PEAT EROSION IS DIFFICULT. THE PESERA-GRID MODEL WAS SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIED IN THIS STUDY TO INCLUDE DOMINANT BLANKET PEAT EROSION PROCESSES. IN THE RESULTING FLUVIAL EROSION MODEL, PESERA-PEAT, FREEZE-THAW AND DESICCATION PROCESSES WERE ACCOUNTED FOR BY A NOVEL SEDIMENT SUPPLY INDEX AS KEY FEATURES OF EROSION. LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WERE PARAMETERIZED FOR THEIR INFLUENCE ON VEGETATION COVER, BIOMASS AND SOIL MOISTURE CONDITION. PESERA-PEAT WAS NUMERICALLY EVALUATED USING AVAILABLE FIELD DATA FROM FOUR BLANKET PEAT-COVERED CATCHMENTS WITH DIFFERENT EROSION CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT INTENSITY. PESERA-PEAT WAS FOUND TO BE ROBUST IN MODELLING FLUVIAL EROSION IN BLANKET PEAT.

TWO VERSIONS OF PESERA-PEAT, EQUILIBRIUM AND TIME-SERIES, PRODUCED SIMILAR RESULTS UNDER THE SAME ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, FACILITATING THE USE OF THE MODEL AT DIFFERENT SCALES. THE EQUILIBRIUM MODEL IS SUITABLE FOR ASSESSING THE HIGH-RESOLUTION SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF AVERAGE MONTHLY PEAT EROSION OVER THE STUDY PERIOD ACROSS LARGE AREAS (NATIONAL OR GLOBAL ASSESSMENTS), WHILE THE TIME-SERIES MODEL IS APPROPRIATE FOR INVESTIGATING CONTINUOUS MONTHLY PEAT EROSION THROUGHOUT STUDY PERIODS ACROSS SMALLER AREAS OR LARGE REGIONS USING A COARSER-SPATIAL RESOLUTION.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO CHARACTERIZE CHANGES IN RUNOFF QUANTITY AND QUALITY WITHIN, AND BETWEEN PEATLANDS AND PONDS THROUGHOUT THE SNOW-FREE SUMMER SEASON. TWO PONDS AND THEIR CATCHMENTS WERE MONITORED OVER THE SNOW-FREE SEASON TO MEASURE CHANGES IN HYDROLOGIC STORAGE, AND TO DETERMINE HOW WATER CHEMISTRY CHANGED WITH THE EVOLUTION OF THE FROST TABLE DEPTH. THRESHOLDS IN HYDROLOGIC STORAGE COMBINED WITH FROST TABLE POSITION (WHICH INHIBITED INFILTRATION AND STORAGE) PRODUCED NONLINEAR RESPONSES FOR RUNOFF GENERATION THROUGH HIGHLY CONDUCTIVE SHALLOW PEAT LAYERS WHILE DEEPER, LESS CONDUCTIVE LAYERS RETARDED FLOW. GREATER INPUTS WERE REQUIRED TO EXCEED HYDROLOGIC STORAGE (FILL AND SPILL) AS A DEEPENING FROST TABLE INCREASED THE HYDROLOGICALLY ACTIVE PORTION OF THE SOIL, LEADING TO SEASONAL VARIABILITY IN RUNOFF PATHWAYS BETWEEN PEATLANDS AND PONDS. RUNOFF CONTRIBUTIONS TO PONDS WERE AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF THE SNOW-FREE WATER BALANCE DURING THE STUDY PERIOD, CONTRIBUTING UP TO 60% OF ALL SNOW-FREE INPUTS. GROUNDWATER CHEMISTRY (AND POND CHEMISTRY FOLLOWING RUNOFF EVENTS WHEN PONDS WERE CONNECTED WITH PEATLANDS) REFLECTED THE DIFFERENT DEPTHS OF PEAT AND MINERAL SOIL ACCESSED THROUGHOUT THE SEASON.

HYDROLOGIC REGIME) INFLUENCES THE STRUCTURE OF AQUATIC COMMUNITIES IN NORTHERN PEATLANDS. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINED PATTERNS IN NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY AND AQUATIC COMMUNITY STRUCTURE DURING A NATURAL FLOODING EVENT IN AN ALASKAN FEN WHERE WATER-TABLE POSITION HAD BEEN MANIPULATED IN THREE LARGE-SCALE EXPERIMENTAL PLOTS DURING PREVIOUS YEARS TO SIMULATE BOTH DROUGHT (LOWERED WATER-TABLE TREATMENT) AND FLOODING (RAISED WATER-TABLE TREATMENT) CONDITIONS RELATIVE TO A CONTROL WITHOUT MANIPULATION. ALTHOUGH THE NATURAL FLOOD DISRUPTED THE LONG-TERM EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION, IT PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE HOW VARIATION IN PAST HYDROLOGIC REGIME INFLUENCES NUTRIENT DYNAMICS AND AQUATIC FOOD WEB STRUCTURE DURING PERIODS OF INUNDATION IN A NORTHERN BOREAL PEATLAND. DESPITE SIMILAR WATER DEPTH AMONG EXPERIMENTAL PLOTS DURING THE TIME OF SAMPLING (I.E. WATER WAS ABOVE THE PEAT SURFACE IN ALL PLOTS), WATER-COLUMN NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IN THE DROUGHT TREATMENT (WHERE WATER TABLE HAD BEEN LOWERED DURING THE PREVIOUS GROWING SEASON) COMPARED TO THE RAISED WATER-TABLE TREATMENT AND THE CONTROL. ALGAL PRODUCTION INCREASED WITH ENHANCED NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY ACROSS ALL WATER-TABLE TREATMENTS AND WAS MOST ELEVATED FOLLOWING THE REWETTING OF DRY SEDIMENTS IN THE DROUGHT TREATMENT. CONSUMER BIOMASS (HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIA AND MACROINVERTEBRATES) INCREASED WITH ALGAL PRODUCTION AND WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IN THE DROUGHT TREATMENT COMPARED TO THE RAISED WATER-TABLE TREATMENT AND THE CONTROL. CONSUMER BIOMASS DECREASED INTO THE SECOND YEAR OF CONSTANT INUNDATION AS ALGAL PRODUCTION WAS CONSTRAINED BY REDUCED NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY. STABLE ISOTOPE ANALYSIS (C-13 AND N-15) SHOWED THAT ELEVATED LEVELS OF PERIPHYTON (I.E. THE INTACT BIOFILM) ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCED NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY PROMOTED ENERGY TRANSFER TO HIGHER TROPHIC LEVELS (GRAZERS AND PREDATORS) RATHER THAN LIVING OR DEAD MOSSES OR VASCULAR PLANT MATERIAL. CONSUMPTION OF ALGAL MATERIAL BY GRAZERS ALTERED THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF THE ALGAL COMMUNITY. THE ALGAL COMMUNITY SHIFTED FROM COCCOID (EDIBLE) TO FILAMENTOUS (INEDIBLE) GROWTH FORMS WITH INCREASED GRAZER ABUNDANCE IN THE DROUGHT TREATMENT, POSSIBLY OWING TO SELECTIVE GRAZING. CONVERSELY, THERE WAS A SIMILAR PROPORTION OF EDIBLE AND INEDIBLE TAXA IN THE CONTROL AND RAISED TREATMENTS WHERE GRAZERS WERE LOWER IN ABUNDANCE. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE LEGACY EFFECTS OF DROUGHT CAN REGULATE AQUATIC COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN NORTHERN PEATLANDS. WITHIN A PREDICTIVE CONTEXT, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT CONDITIONS OF MORE VARIABLE HYDROLOGY EXPECTED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE (I.E.

WE CONDUCTED A FIELD IN SITU DRAINAGE EXPERIMENT CONSISTING OF LOW (PLOTS SURROUNDED BY 50 CM DEEP DITCHES), INTERMEDIATE (20 CM DEEP) AND HIGH (INTACT) WATER TABLE LEVELS. THE EXPERIMENT LASTED FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS, DURING WHICH WE MEASURED SCE RATE AND ASSOCIATED VARIABLES INCLUDING SOIL TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE WITH A HIGHER FREQUENCY IN THE GROWING SEASON (MAY-SEPTEMBER) THAN THE NON-GROWING SEASON (OCTOBER-APRIL). EXPERIMENTAL DRAINAGE DECREASED WATER TABLE HEIGHT BY CA. 12 CM AND 15 CM (RELATIVE TO THE INTACT) AND SOIL MOISTURE (AT 5 CM SOIL) BY 6% AND 12% (RELATIVE TO 45% IN THE INTACT) ON AVERAGE IN INTERMEDIATE AND LOW WATER TABLE TREATMENTS, RESPECTIVELY, BUT IT DID NOT AFFECT SOIL TEMPERATURE DURING THE EXPERIMENTAL YEARS. THE EFFECT OF DRAINAGE ON SCE VARIED WITH SEASON. IN THE NON-GROWING SEASON, THE DRAINAGE EFFECT WAS NONSIGNIFICANT IN EACH MEASUREMENT POSSIBLY BECAUSE THE LOW-TEMPERATURE EFFECT OVERRODE THE DRAINAGE EFFECT ON SCE. IN THE GROWING SEASON, THE DRAINAGE MOSTLY INCREASED THE EMISSION EXCEPT FOR SEVERAL CASES, IN WHICH A NEGATIVE EFFECT WAS OBSERVED. THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF DRAINAGE COULD BE DUE TO THE LOW SOIL MOISTURE (< 25%) IN THE DRAINED TREATMENTS.

IN A CASE STUDY OF A SUBARCTIC MIRE IN NORTHERN SWEDEN, WE EXAMINED THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH INTERACTIONS ON PEAT ACCUMULATION PATTERNS AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF MICROTOPOGRAPHICAL STRUCTURE.

THIS WAS DONE BY FORMULATING STATISTICAL EQUATIONS BETWEEN STREAMWATER CONCENTRATIONS AND CLIMATE, SOIL, FOREST MANAGEMENT AND RUNOFF VARIABLES AND SPATIAL DATA ON CATCHMENT CHARACTERISTICS. THE EQUATIONS WERE BASED ON A LARGE, LONG-TERM RUNOFF AND STREAMWATER QUALITY DATASET, WHICH WAS COLLECTED FROM 28 PRISTINE AND 61 MANAGED BOREAL FOREST CATCHMENTS LOCATED AROUND FINLAND. WE FOUND THAT THE CONCENTRATIONS INCREASED WITH TEMPERATURE SUM (TS), I.E. FROM NORTH TO SOUTH.

THE RESERVOIR MODEL IS BASED ON FOREST-DNDC, A TERRESTRIAL BIOGEOCHEMISTRY MODEL WHICH SUPPORTS DETAILED SOIL CARBON (C) PROCESSES INCLUDING REDOX CHEMISTRY, WITH MODIFICATION TO REPRESENT THE DISTURBED SOIL AND VEGETATION C DYNAMICS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF AN OVERLYING WATER COLUMN ON THE ECOSYSTEMS. SOIL DECOMPOSITION RATES AND TEMPERATURE AND OXYGEN PROFILES WERE CHANGED, AND SEDIMENTATION TO THE SOIL SURFACE WAS ADDED. FF-DNDC WAS EVALUATED USING CO2 EXCHANGE MEASUREMENTS FROM THE NEWLY CREATED EASTMAIN-1 RESERVOIR IN NORTHERN QUEBEC, CANADA. FOR THE FIRST FOUR YEARS OF THE RESERVOIR (2006 TO 2009), SIMULATED DAILY CO2 EMISSIONS AVERAGED 1.42 G C M(-2) D(-1) (RANGING FROM 0.75 TO 3.24 G C M(-2) D(-1)) FROM THE FLOODED FOREST AND 0.74 G CM-2 D(-1) (RANGING FROM 0.51 TO 1.09 GC M(-2) D(-1)) FROM THE FLOODED PEATLAND. THE SIMULATED EMISSIONS WERE SMALLER THAN THE THIN-FILMED BOUNDARY LAYER EXCHANGES BASED ON MEASURED PARTIAL PRESSURE OF CARBON DIOXIDE (PCO(2)) BUT WERE LARGER THAN THE EXCHANGES MEASURED USING AN EDDY COVARIANCE SYSTEM.

WE INVESTIGATED A 2 KM REACH OF THE COASTAL QUASHNET RIVER IN CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS, USA, TO RELATE PREFERRED FISH SPAWNING HABITATS TO GEOLOGY, GEOMORPHOLOGY, AND DISCHARGING GROUNDWATER GEOCHEMISTRY. THERMAL RECONNAISSANCE METHODS WERE USED TO LOCATE ZONES OF RAPID GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE, WHICH WERE PREDOMINANTLY FOUND ALONG THE CENTRAL CHANNEL OF A WIDER STREAM VALLEY SECTION. PORE-WATER CHEMISTRY AND TEMPORAL VERTICAL GROUNDWATER FLUX WERE MEASURED AT A SUBSET OF THESE ZONES DURING FIELD CAMPAIGNS OVER SEVERAL SEASONS. SEEPAGE ZONES IN OPEN-VALLEY SUB-REACHES GENERALLY SHOWED SUBOXIC CONDITIONS AND HIGHER DISSOLVED SOLUTES COMPARED TO THE UNDERLYING GLACIAL OUTWASH AQUIFER. THESE DISCHARGE ZONES WERE CROSS-REFERENCED WITH PREFERRED BROOK TROUT REDDS AND EVALUATED DURING 10 YEARS OF OBSERVATION, ALL OF WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED WITH DISCRETE ALCOVE FEATURES IN STEEP CUTBANKS, WHERE STREAM MEANDER BENDS INTERSECT THE GLACIAL VALLEY WALLS. SEEPAGE IN THESE REPEAT SPAWNING ZONES WAS GENERALLY STRONGER AND MORE VARIABLE THAN IN OPEN-VALLEY SITES, WITH HIGHER DISSOLVED OXYGEN AND REDUCED SOLUTE CONCENTRATIONS. THE COMBINED EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT REGIONAL GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE ALONG THE BROADER VALLEY BOTTOM IS PREDOMINANTLY SUBOXIC DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF NEAR-STREAM ORGANIC DEPOSITS; TROUT SHOW NO OBVIOUS PREFERENCE FOR THESE ZONES WHEN SPAWNING. HOWEVER, THE MEANDER BENDS THAT CUT INTO SANDY DEPOSITS NEAR THE VALLEY WALLS GENERATE STRONG OXIC SEEPAGE ZONES THAT ARE UTILIZED ROUTINELY FOR REDD CONSTRUCTION AND THE OVERWINTERING OF TROUT EGGS.

GALWAY, IRELAND. THE SURFACE OF THE BOG WAS LITTERED WITH STANDING TREE STUMPS, THE REMNANTS OF A HOLOCENE FOREST THAT HAD SUCCUMBED TO A RELATIVELY SUDDEN DROWNING. A COMBINATION OF INORGANIC AND ORGANIC GEOCHEMICAL TECHNIQUES WAS APPLIED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THIS RAPID SUBMERSION AND TO GLEAN PALAEOCLIMATIC INFORMATION FROM THE PRESERVED RECORD WITHIN THE PEAT. THE STUDY REPRESENTS THE FIRST USE OF A MULTIPROXY LIPID BIOMARKER APPROACH TO INVESTIGATE PALAEOCLIMATE CONDITIONS FROM A PEAT BOG IN IRELAND. THE RESULTS PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF CLIMATIC VARIATION THROUGHOUT A CA. 3400 YR TIMEFRAME DURING THE MID-HOLOCENE. BIOMARKER PROXIES DISPLAYING THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF SPHAGNUM SPP. VS. HIGHER PLANTS WERE USED TO SHOW CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION AND TEMPERATURE DURING PEAT FORMATION. THE DATA CORRELATE WITH DESCRIBED EVENTS, INCLUDING THE 4.2 KA EVENT AND THE SUBBOREAL-SUBATLANTIC TRANSITION AND SHOW THE BENEFIT OF A LIPID BIOMARKER METHOD FOR INVESTIGATING IRELAND'S PEATLAND RESOURCES. IN PARTICULAR, THE INDICATION OF COLDER/WETTER CONDITIONS COINCIDING WITH THE 4.2 KA EVENT IMPLIES THE POSSIBILITY THAT ITS EFFECTS WERE FELT IN IRELAND, CONTRARY TO SOME REPORTS.

DESPITE THE HIGH VOLUME OF RAINFALL, MAJOR IONS IN STREAM WATERS REMAINED STRONGLY CHEMOSTATIC THROUGHOUT THE EVENT. THIS WAS PARTICULARLY THE CASE FOR CA2+ AND MG2+, AS WELL AS THE ALKALINITY BY ASSOCIATION, AND SUGGESTS THAT CHEMICAL REGULATION OF THESE PARTICULAR CATIONS OCCURS THROUGH RAPID EQUILIBRATION PROCESSES. DOC CONCENTRATIONS INCREASED DURING THE STORM PULSE, LEADING TO A SHIFT IN ALKALINITY PARTITIONING FROM BICARBONATE TO ORGANIC ANIONS AND A DECREASE IN PH, MEDIATED BY THE CO2 SATURATION LEVELS IN THE STREAM WATER.

HERE WE RECONSTRUCT PAST PATTERNS OF FIRE FREQUENCY AND FIRE TYPE, AND EXPLORE HOW THE FIRE-RELATED TRAITS OF BOREAL SPECIES AND PLANT FUNCTIONAL TYPES (PFTS) DETERMINE ECOSYSTEM RESPONSES TO CHANGING FIRE REGIMES. WE USE CHARCOAL-BASED RECONSTRUCTIONS OF THE FIRE REGIME IN COMBINATION WITH A POLLEN-BASED ASSESSMENT OF VEGETATION COMPOSITION IN TWO BOREAL FOREST PEAT PROFILES FROM PLOTNIKOVO MIRE IN WESTERN SIBERIA THAT SPAN THE LAST 2400 AND 5000 YEARS. WE FOUND MODERATE LEVELS OF BIOMASS BURNING BETWEEN 5000 AND 4000 CAL YR BP. BIOMASS BURNING AND FIRE SEVERITY I.E., MORE BIOMASS BURNING PER FIRE EPISODE, INCREASED OVER THE LAST 1500 CAL YR BP ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOMINANCE OF FIRE INVADERS (BETULA). CONVERSELY, BETWEEN 4000 AND 1500 CAL YR BP LOWER BIOMASS BURNING, WITH PERHAPS FIRE TYPES AFFECTING MOSTLY LITTER AND UNDERSTOREY VEGETATION, COINCIDED WITH THE DOMINANCE OF FIRE RESISTERS (E.G., PINUS SYLVESTRIS, P.

THIS LONG-TERM PERSPECTIVE SHOWS THAT THE CURRENT FIRE REGIME COMMENCED 1500 YEARS AGO AND DEVIATES FROM THE TRENDS OBSERVED OVER THE LAST 5000 YEARS. THIS DEVIATION IS LINKED TO A COMBINATION OF CLIMATE CONDITIONS CONDUCIVE TO FIRE, THE AMOUNT AND COMPOSITION OF WOODY FUELS, AND LAND USE CHANGES. ALTHOUGH PINES REACTED MORE SENSITIVELY TO INCREASED FIRE SEVERITY, THE FIRE AVOIDER PICEA OBOVATA APPEARS TO BE MUCH MORE VULNERABLE TO BOTH FREQUENT, SEVERE FIRES THAN ABIES SIBIRICA. WE ANTICIPATE THAT CLIMATICALLY DRIVEN CHANGES IN FIRE WEATHER, WITH FREQUENT WARM AND DRY SPELLS, AND ANTHROPOGENIC LAND USE INTENSIFICATION WILL HEIGHTEN FIRE SEVERITY AND THEIR IMPACT, DRIVING VEGETATION COMPOSITION TOWARDS BETULA SPECIES TO THE DETRIMENT OF PICEA OBOVATA.

THE COMPLEX CLIMATE-FIRE-ECOSYSTEM INTERACTIONS WERE NOT FULLY INTEGRATED IN PREVIOUS CLIMATE MODEL STUDIES, AND THE RESULTING EFFECTS ON THE PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. HERE WE USE THE FULLY INTERACTIVE REGION-SPECIFIC ECOSYSTEM FEEDBACK FIRE MODEL (RESFIRE) THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN THE COMMUNITY EARTH SYSTEM MODEL (CESM) TO INVESTIGATE THESE INTERACTIONS AND THEIR IMPACTS ON CLIMATE SYSTEMS AND FIRE ACTIVITY. WE DESIGNED TWO SETS OF DECADAL SIMULATIONS USING CESM-RESFIRE FOR PRESENT-DAY (2001-2010) AND FUTURE (2051-2060) SCENARIOS, RESPECTIVELY, AND CONDUCTED A SERIES OF SENSITIVITY EXPERIMENTS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF INDIVIDUAL FEEDBACK PATHWAYS AMONG CLIMATE, FIRE, AND ECOSYSTEMS.

WATER SOURCES FEEDING DONANA, INCLUDING GROUNDWATER AND STREAMS, ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON THE FLUCTUATING BALANCE BETWEEN ANNUAL PRECIPITATION AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION. HENCE, IN ORDER TO EXAMINE THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE RAINFALL PATTERN TO THE EMISSION/CAPTURE OF CO2 BY A RANGE OF AQUATIC HABITATS IN DONANA, WE TOOK MONTHLY MEASUREMENTS DURING SEVERELY WET, DRY, AND NORMAL HYDROLOGICAL YEARS (2010-2013). DURING WET HYDROLOGICAL CYCLES, CO2 OUTGASSING FROM FLOODED MARSHES MARKEDLY DECREASED IN COMPARISON TO THAT OBSERVED DURING SUBSEQUENT DRY-NORMAL CYCLES, WITH MEAN VALUES OF 25.8419 AND 5.28MMOLM(-2)D(-1), RESPECTIVELY.

PALADYN EXPLICITLY TREATS PERMAFROST, BOTH IN PHYSICAL PROCESSES AND AS AN IMPORTANT CARBON POOL. IT DISTINGUISHES NINE SURFACE TYPES: FIVE DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES, BARE SOIL, LAND ICE, LAKE AND OCEAN SHELF. INCLUDING THE OCEAN SHELF ALLOWS THE TREATMENT OF CONTINUOUS CHANGES IN SEA LEVEL AND SHELF AREA ASSOCIATED WITH GLACIAL CYCLES. OVER EACH SURFACE TYPE, THE MODEL SOLVES THE SURFACE ENERGY BALANCE AND COMPUTES THE FLUXES OF SENSIBLE, LATENT AND GROUND HEAT AND UPWARD SHORTWAVE AND LONGWAVE RADIATION. THE MODEL INCLUDES A SINGLE SNOW LAYER. VEGETATION AND BARE SOIL SHARE A SINGLE SOIL COLUMN. THE SOIL IS VERTICALLY DISCRETIZED INTO FIVE LAYERS WHERE PROGNOSTIC EQUATIONS FOR TEMPERATURE, WATER AND CARBON ARE CONSISTENTLY SOLVED. PHASE CHANGES OF WATER IN THE SOIL ARE EXPLICITLY CONSIDERED. A SURFACE HYDROLOGY MODULE COMPUTES PRECIPITATION INTERCEPTION BY VEGETATION, SURFACE RUNOFF AND SOIL INFILTRATION. THE SOIL WATER EQUATION IS BASED ON DARCY'S LAW. GIVEN SOIL WATER CONTENT, THE WETLAND FRACTION IS COMPUTED BASED ON A TOPOGRAPHIC INDEX. THE TEMPERATURE PROFILE IS ALSO COMPUTED IN THE UPPER PART OF ICE SHEETS AND IN THE OCEAN SHELF SOIL. PHOTOSYNTHESIS IS COMPUTED USING A LIGHT USE EFFICIENCY MODEL. CARBON ASSIMILATION BY VEGETATION IS COUPLED TO THE TRANSPIRATION OF WATER THROUGH STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE. PALADYN INCLUDES A DYNAMIC VEGETATION MODULE WITH FIVE PLANT FUNCTIONAL TYPES COMPETING FOR THE GRID CELL SHARE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY. PALADYN DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN MINERAL SOIL CARBON, PEAT CARBON, BURIED CARBON AND SHELF CARBON. EACH SOIL CARBON TYPE HAS ITS OWN SOIL CARBON POOLS GENERALLY REPRESENTED BY A LITTER, A FAST AND A SLOW CARBON POOL IN EACH SOIL LAYER. CARBON CAN BE REDISTRIBUTED BETWEEN THE LAYERS BY VERTICAL DIFFUSION AND ADVECTION. FOR THE VEGETATED MACRO SURFACE TYPE, DECOMPOSITION IS A FUNCTION OF SOIL TEMPERATURE AND SOIL MOISTURE. CARBON IN PERMANENTLY FROZEN LAYERS IS ASSIGNED A LONG TURNOVER TIME WHICH EFFECTIVELY LOCKS CARBON IN PERMAFROST. CARBON BURIED BELOW ICE SHEETS AND ON FLOODED OCEAN SHELVES IS TREATED DIFFERENTLY. THE MODEL ALSO INCLUDES A DYNAMIC PEAT MODULE. PALADYN INCLUDES CARBON ISOTOPES C-13 AND C-14, WHICH ARE TRACKED THROUGH ALL CARBON POOLS. ISOTOPIC DISCRIMINATION IS MODELLED ONLY DURING PHOTOSYNTHESIS.

ORCHIDEE WAS APPLIED IN STAND-ALONE MODE, ON TWO EXPERIMENTAL SITES LOCATED IN THE YAMAL PENINSULA IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF SIBERIA.

THE RESULTS SHOW HOW SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS CAN IDENTIFY THE DOMINANT PROCESSES AND THEREBY REDUCE THE PARAMETER SPACE FOR THE CALIBRATION PROCESS. WE ALSO DISCUSS THE MODEL PERFORMANCE AT SIMULATING THE SOIL TEMPERATURE AND WATER CONTENT (I.E., ENERGY AND WATER TRANSFERS IN THE SOIL-VEGETATION-ATMOSPHERE CONTINUUM) AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE VERTICAL DISCRETIZATION OF THE HYDROTHERMAL PROPERTIES. THIS WORK CLEARLY SHOWS, AT LEAST AT THE TWO SITES USED FOR VALIDATION, THAT THE NEW ORCHIDEE VERTICAL DISCRETIZATION CAN REPRESENT THE WATER AND HEAT TRANSFERS THROUGH COMPLEX CRYOGENIC ARCTIC SOILS-SOILS WHICH PRESENT MULTIPLE HORIZONS SOMETIMES WITH PEAT INCLUSIONS.

THE VOLUME OF THE IRRIGATION WATER THAT HAS TO BE APPLIED TO ATTAIN 100% FIELD CAPACITY WAS PERFORMED AS FI, WHILE 50% OF FI WAS CONSIDERED AS DI. THE WATER WAS TRANSPORTED DIRECTLY INTO THE POTS BY MICRO-IRRIGATION SYSTEMS CONSISTING OF INDIVIDUAL SPAGHETTI TUBES. THE VINES OF DI TREATMENT SHOWED VISIBLE SYMPTOMS OF MILD WATER STRESS (E.G., LOSS OF TURGOR IN SHOOT TIPS), BUT NO DEFOLIATION OR LEAF NECROSIS OCCURRED. DI TREATMENT REDUCED THE GS OF 'MICHELE PALIERI' SCION CULTIVAR IN VARYING LEVELS DEPENDING ON THE ROOTSTOCK. DI TREATMENT ALSO AFFECTED VEGETATIVE GROWTH OF THE SCION CULTIVAR IN DIFFERENT LEVELS.

TO UNDERSTAND HOW NET THE ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE (NEE) OF CO2 WILL RESPOND TO CHANGING CLIMATIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES OF THE PROCESSES CONTRIBUTING TO NEE. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY AIMED TO PARTITION NEE AT THE SOIL-PLANT-ATMOSPHERE INTERFACE IN AN ARCTIC TUNDRA ECOSYSTEM AND TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS OF THESE FLUXES.

TO ANALYZE THE IMPACTS OF WETLAND TYPE, SOIL TYPE, MEAN ANNUAL PRECIPITATION (MAP), MEAN ANNUAL TEMPERATURE (MAT), EVAPOTRANSPIRATION (ET), ELEVATION (EL), AND SLOPE (SL) ON SOCC, STATISTICAL ANALYSIS METHODS WERE EXECUTED, INCLUDING ANOVA WITH THE DUNCAN TEST, PEARSON CORRELATIONS ANALYSIS, AND THE STEPWISE MULTIPLE REGRESSIONS ANALYSIS.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTHE MEAN VALUES OF SOCC IN THE 0-30, 30-60, AND 60-100-CM INTERVALS WERE 130.4, 64.2, AND 32.6GKG(-1), RESPECTIVELY. THE WETLAND TYPE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE PATTERN OF SOCC IN TERMS OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES (P<0.05) AMONG THE DIFFERENT WETLAND TYPES IN THE 0-60-CM DEPTH. HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE NOT FOUND AMONG DIFFERENT SOIL TYPES. IN TERMS OF THE WETLAND TYPE, THE HIGHEST SOCC WAS FOUND IN BOGS (P<0.05), PROBABLY DUE TO THE HIGHER MAP AND LOWER MAT.

KA BP USING NUMEROUS BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC PROXIES, SUCH AS CHIRONOMIDS, CLADOCERANS, POLLEN AND SPORES, DELTA C-13(ORG), DELTA N-1(5)ORG, DELTA O-18(CARB), DELTA C-13(CARB), TOC/N, FE, S, LOI550, AND LOI950. THE CHIRONOMID-DERIVED RECONSTRUCTION OF MEAN JULY AIR TEMPERATURE DID NOT CHANGE DURING THE 4.2 KA EVENT. POLLEN ACCUMULATION RATE (PAR) DATA SHOWED LOWER POLLEN PRODUCTION OF SOME TREE TAXA DURING THE PERIOD 4.0-4.25 CAL. KA BP THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH LOW PARS RECORDED FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN THE SEDIMENTS OF NEARBY (SIMILAR TO 75 KM) LAKE SUMINKO. THIS CHANGE MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED DUE TO EITHER REGIONAL-SCALE FOREST DISTURBANCE OR COOLER WINTERS RESULTING FROM AN EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG SIBERIAN HIGH DURING THE 4.2 KA EVENT. DISTINCT PEAKS OF FE AND DELTA C-13(CARB) AT 4.2 CAL. KA BP LIKELY RECORD A PULSE OF PODZOLIZATION. ALTHOUGH SOIL TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES WERE COMMON IN EAST-CENTRAL EUROPE AFTER CA. 5 CAL. KA BP DUE TO GENERAL CLIMATE COOLING, THEY COULD HAVE BEEN ENHANCED AT LAKE SPORE DURING THE 4.2 KA EVENT, IF WINTERS WERE MORE SEVERE. THE DELTA C-13(ORG), DELTA N-15(ORG), TOC/N AND DELTA O-1(8)CARB RECORDS POINT TO A WATER LEVEL RISE AFTER 4.2 CAL. KA BP THAT MOST LIKELY RESULTED FROM SOIL TRANSFORMATION IN THE CATCHMENT, NOT A CHANGE IN EFFECTIVE PRECIPITATION. THE COMPOSITION OF THE TERRESTRIAL VEGETATION AND THE LAKE FAUNA AND FLORA REMAINED LARGELY UNAFFECTED BY THE 4.2 KA EVENT.","SEARCHING FOR THE 4.2 KA CLIMATE EVENT AT LAKE SPORE, POLAND","CATENA","ARTICLE","AUG",2020,"10.1016/j.catena.2020.104565","GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY; SOIL SCIENCE; WATER RESOURCES","WOS:000531077700008"

AT MID-LATITUDES, SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WESTERLY STORMINESS, SOLAR ACTIVITY AND INTERNAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC MODES OF VARIABILITY HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY EVIDENCED TO EXIST OVER MILLENNIAL AND CENTENNIAL TIME SCALES. HOWEVER, AT SHORTER (DECADAL) SCALE, IT IS STILL CHALLENGING TO ESTABLISH CLEAR CONTROL LINKS BETWEEN THE FORCING MECHANISMS AND THE SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF PAST EXTRA-TROPICAL STORMS. THIS PROBABLY OWES TO THE EXISTENCE OF COMPLEX MULTI-SCALE RELATIONSHIPS AND FEEDBACK LOOPS, AS WELL AS TO THE DIFFICULTY OF PRODUCING PROXY-RECORDS OF SUFFICIENTLY HIGH-RESOLUTION AND WIDE SPATIAL SIGNIFICANCE. HERE WE PRESENT A RECONSTRUCTION OF WESTERLY STORMINESS IN WESTERN DENMARK BETWEEN 4840 AND 2300 YRS. CAL. B.P. PAST-STORMINESS IS RETRIEVED FROM AN ORGANIC-RICH SEDIMENTARY SUCCESSION BY COMBINING MARKERS OF AEOLIAN SAND INFLUX, MU-XRF GEOCHEMISTRY AND PLANT MACROFOSSILS. PARTICULAR FOCUS IS PAID TO THE C. 4840-4350 YRS. CAL. B.P. PERIOD FOR WHICH OUR RECORD IS CHARACTERIZED BY A PLURI-ANNUAL RESOLUTION. WE EVIDENCE CONCURRENT PLURI-DECADAL SHIFTS IN STORMINESS AND HUMIDITY REGIME AT OUR SITE THAT WE INTERPRET AS RELOCATIONS OF THE MEAN WESTERLY STORM-TRACK OVER THE NORTH-ATLANTIC. THE SIGNAL IS DOMINATED BY APPROXIMATE TO 90, APPROXIMATE TO 50-80 AND APPROXIMATE TO 35-YR PERIODS, EVOKING POSSIBLE LINKS WITH SOLAR ACTIVITY, THE NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION (NAO), THE ATLANTIC MULTIDECADAL OSCILLATION (AMO) AND THE ATLANTIC MERIDIONAL OVERTURNING CIRCULATION (AMOC) MODES OF VARIABILITY, RESPECTIVELY. THE APPROXIMATE TO 35-YR PERIODICITY FOUND IN OUR RECORD IS ESPECIALLY STRONG AND STATIONARY, SUGGESTING THAT STORMINESS COULD HAVE BEEN CLOSELY LINKED WITH THE AMOC OVER THE STUDY PERIOD. OUR RECORDS OF STORMINESS INDEED SHOW SOME GREAT SIMILARITIES WITH A RECORD OF DEEP OVERFLOW OF A BRANCH OF THE AMOC. OPPOSITE TO SOME MODEL OUTPUTS, THE STRENGTH OF THE AMOC SEEMS TO HAVE OFTEN CO-VARIED WITH STORMINESS AT PLURI-DECADAL SCALES OVER THE STUDY PERIOD. WE ALSO FIND PERIODS OF HIGH STORMINESS ACTIVITY TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH SOLAR MINIMA AND RELATIVE PLURI-DECADAL LOWS IN THE NAO. WE SUGGEST THAT SMALL LOWERING IN THE STRENGTH OF THE NAO IN AN OTHERWISE POSITIVE NAO CONTEXT MAY HAVE CAUSED SOUTHWARD RELOCATIONS OF THE MEAN WESTERLY STORM-TRACK FROM SUBPOLAR LATITUDES TO NORTHERN EUROPE. THIS INVITES TO RECONSIDER THE IMPORTANCE GIVEN TO USING THE NAO AS A BINARY INDEX. FINALLY, AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO EXPLORE THE TEMPORAL LEAD-LAG RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN STORMINESS AND DIFFERENT POTENTIAL FORCING AGENTS SUCH AS THE TOTAL SOLAR IRRADIANCE, THE NAO AND THE AMOC. UNFORTUNATELY, THE INSUFFICIENT CHRONOLOGICAL PRECISION OF THE PROXY-RECORDS AVAILABLE FOR THE TSI, THE NAO AND THE AMOC OVER THE STUDY PERIOD PREVENTS US FROM DERIVING ANY ROBUST INTERPRETATIONS REGARDING POTENTIAL TELECONNECTIONS AT A DECADAL-SCALE BETWEEN PAST NORTH-ATLANTIC WESTERLY STORMINESS ACTIVITY, SOLAR FORCING, THE NAO AND NORTH-ATLANTIC SURFACE AND DEEP OCEANIC CIRCULATION.","DECADAL VARIABILITY OF NORTH-EASTERN ATLANTIC STORMINESS AT THE MID-HOLOCENE: NEW INFERENCES FROM A RECORD OF WIND-BLOWN SAND, WESTERN DENMARK","GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE","ARTICLE","SEP",2019,"10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.05.010","GEOGRAPHY, PHYSICAL; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000478709700002"

DETAILED ANALYSIS OF ICE CORES FROM THE GREENLAND HOLES GRIP, GISP2, AND NGRIP WITH A TIME RESOLUTION OF ABOUT 10 YEARS MADE POSSIBLE TO REFINE THE DURATION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TIME STRUCTURE OF THIS COLD PERIOD. THIS COOLING LASTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 160 YR. SPORE-POLLEN ANALYSIS OF LAKE SEDIMENTS IN NORTHERN EUROPE (SWEDEN, FINLAND, DENMARK, GERMANY, THE NORTH AND NORTH-WEST OF RUSSIA) AND DEEP-SEA CORES OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC SHOWED THAT THE MEAN ANNUAL AIR TEMPERATURE DURING THE MAXIMUM STAGE OF THE COOLING WAS REDUCED BY 1-2 DEGREES C, AND IN SOME AREAS BY MORE THAN 3 DEGREES C. THE COLD SPREAD FROM THE COAST OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC INTO THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT AND MANIFESTED ITSELF MOSTLY IN SWEDEN, FINLAND, THE BALTIC STATES, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT IN THE NORTH-WEST AND WEST OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. IN THE CENTRAL RUSSIA AND NORTH OF 70 DEGREES N THE COOLING WAS WEAK OR ABSENT. THE QUESTION ABOUT A NATURE OF THIS COLD EVENT AND OTHER COLD SPELLS IN LATE GLACIATION, KNOWN AS THE COLD OF THE EARLY, MIDDLE AND LATE DRYAS, IS WIDELY DISCUSSED IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. MOST OF SCIENTISTS ACCEPT A HYPOTHESIS PROPOSED MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO, THAT THE REDUCTION OF AIR TEMPERATURES IN REGIONS IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC WAS CAUSED BY THE LARGE VOLUME OF MELT WATER DISCHARGED INTO THE OCEAN AS A RESULT OF DISINTEGRATION AND MELTING OF ICE-SHEETS. CLIMATE MODELS THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THESE EFFECTS ALLOW ESTIMATING A DECREASE IN THE AIR AND SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE DUE TO FRESHENING (DESALINATION) OF THE UPPER OCEAN LAYER, AND THIS CONFIRMS THAT THE GREATEST DECREASE IN TEMPERATURE SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN THE REGIONS DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO THE OCEAN. THE INCREASE IN GLOBAL TEMPERATURE OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS IS ESTIMATED TO BE 0.8 +/- 0.2 DEGREES C, WHICH IS ALREADY REFLECTED IN A NOTICEABLE INCREASE IN PRECIPITATION IN HIGH LATITUDES. IN ADDITION, THE MELTING OF MOUNTAIN GLACIERS AND SEA ICE IN THE ARCTIC BASIN PROMOTES FRESHENING OF THE UPPER OCEAN, AND AS A RESULT OF THESE PROCESSES ONE CAN EXPECT A CERTAIN DECREASE IN THE AIR TEMPERATURE IN THE HIGH LATITUDES IF THE PRESENT-DAY CLIMATE WARMING WILL CONTINUE. ON THE BASIS OF PALEOCLIMATIC DATA, IT CAN BE ASSUMED THAT SUCH A DECREASE IN AIR TEMPERATURE CAN BE RELATIVELY SMALL AND OCCUR ONLY IN AREAS DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC.","COLD PERIOD IN THE NORTHERN EUROPE IN THE PAST (ABOUT 8200 YEARS AGO): ANALYSIS OF EMPIRICAL DATA AND POSSIBLE CAUSES","LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW","ARTICLE",NA,2017,"10.15356/2076-6734-2017-1-117-132","GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000408236600011"

IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW IMMATURE PEATLANDS DEVELOP, WHAT CONDITIONS ARE BENEFICIAL TO THIS PROCESS, AND THE PRESENT STATUS OF THESE IMPORTANT PEATLANDS. PLANT MACROFOSSIL ANALYSIS AND GEOCHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PEAT WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE PLANT SUCCESSION AND THE DEGREE OF DECOMPOSITION AT TWO PEATLANDS DEVELOPING IN THE CHANGBAI MOUNTAIN REGION OF NORTHEASTERN CHINA. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT DURING THE ENTIRE PLANT COMMUNITY SUCCESSION, PLANTS IN THE TWO STUDIED PEATLANDS ARE MAINLY CHARACTERIZED BY SEDGES (CYPERACEAE) AND MOSSES (MAINLY SPHAGNUM).

VARIATION IN PRECIPITATION PATTERNS HAS ALSO BEEN INCREASING, WITH GREATER OCCURRENCES OF BOTH FLOODING AND DROUGHT PERIODS. RECENT WORK HAS POINTED TO THE INCREASING ROLE OF ALGAL PRODUCTION IN REGULATING C CYCLING DURING FLOODED PERIODS IN FEN PEATLANDS, BUT EXACTLY HOW THIS AFFECTS THE C SINK-STRENGTH OF THESE ECOSYSTEMS IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. WE EVALUATED TEMPORAL TRENDS IN ALGAL BIOMASS, ECOSYSTEM C UPTAKE AND RESPIRATION (USING STATIC AND FLOATING CHAMBER TECHNIQUES), AND SPECTROSCOPIC INDICATORS OF DOM QUALITY (ABSORBANCE AND FLUORESCENCE) IN A BOREAL RICH-FEN PEATLAND IN WHICH WATER TABLE POSITION HAD BEEN EXPERIMENTALLY MANIPULATED FOR 13 YEARS. SUPERIMPOSED ON THE WATER TABLE TREATMENTS WERE NATURAL VARIATIONS IN HYDROLOGY, INCLUDING PERIODS OF FLOODING, WHICH ALLOWED US TO EXAMINE THE LEGACY EFFECTS OF FLOODING ON C CYCLING DYNAMICS. WE HAD A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF ALGAE IN REGULATING C CYCLING, AS THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF ALGAL PRODUCTION WAS OBSERVED TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE WITH FLOODING. ECOSYSTEM MEASURES OF GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION (GPP) INCREASED WITH ALGAL BIOMASS, WITH HIGHER ALGAL BIOMASS AND GPP MEASURED IN THE LOWERED WATER TABLE TREATMENT TWO YEARS AFTER PERSISTENT FLOODING. PRIOR TO FLOODING THE LOWERED TREATMENT WAS THE WEAKEST C SINK (AS CO2), BUT THIS TREATMENT BECAME THE STRONGEST SINK AFTER FLOODING. THE LOWER DEGREE OF HUMIFICATION (LOWER HUMIFICATION INDEX, HIX) AND YET LOWER BIOAVAILABILITY (HIGHER SPECTRAL SLOPE RATIO, SR) OF DOM OBSERVED IN THE RAISED TREATMENT PRIOR TO FLOODING PERSISTED AFTER TWO YEARS OF FLOODING. AN INDEX OF FREE OR BOUND PROTEINS (TYROSINE INDEX, TI) INCREASED WITH ALGAL BIOMASS ACROSS ALL PLOTS DURING FLOODING, AND WAS LOWEST IN THE RAISED TREATMENT. AS SUCH, ANTECEDENT DRAINAGE CONDITIONS DETERMINED THE SINK-STRENGTH OF THIS RICH FEN-WHICH WAS ALSO REFLECTED IN DOM CHARACTERISTICS. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT MONITORING FLOODING HISTORY AND ITS EFFECTS ON ALGAL PRODUCTION COULD BECOME IMPORTANT TO ESTIMATES OF C BALANCE IN NORTHERN WETLANDS.","CONSEQUENCES OF INCREASED VARIATION IN PEATLAND HYDROLOGY FOR CARBON STORAGE: LEGACY EFFECTS OF DROUGHT AND FLOOD IN A BOREAL FEN ECOSYSTEM","FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE","ARTICLE","FEB 3",2021,"10.3389/feart.2020.577746","GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000618534000001"

TO ASSESS THE MAGNITUDES OF DAILY AND SEASONAL VARIATIONS IN CH4 FLUX IN THIS AREA, AND TO IDENTIFY THE INFLUENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, AN EDDY COVARIANCE (EC) TOWER WITH A LI-7700 OPEN-PATH CH4 ANALYZER WAS ESTABLISHED ON HONGYUAN PEATLAND. TOTAL ANNUAL CH4 EMISSION WAS 46.8 G CH(4)M(-2) IN 2014, WITH EMISSIONS IN THE NON-GROWING SEASON ACCOUNTING FOR 25% OF THE ANNUAL TOTAL. FROM MAY TO SEPTEMBER 2014, DIURNAL VARIATION IN CH4 EMISSIONS WAS OBSERVED, WITH CH4 FLUXES VARYING BETWEEN 0.15 AND 0.25 MU MOLM(-2) S(-1). IN CONTRAST, DURING ALL OTHER PERIODS OF 2014, NO DIURNAL VARIATION WAS OBSERVED, AND CH4 FLUX VARIED BELOW 0.05 MU MOL M(-2) S(-1). A CLEAR SEASONAL PATTERN IN CH4 EXCHANGE WITH SMALL SURGES IN CH4 EMISSION APPEARED IN SOIL THAWING AND FREEZING SEASONS. WAVELET ANALYSIS WAS APPLIED TO THE CONTINUOUS CH4 FLUX TIME SERIES TO EXPLORE TEMPORAL VARIATION IN ECOSYSTEM CH4 EXCHANGE DURING THE GROWING SEASON. ON DAILY TIMESCALES, CHANGES IN CH4 FLUX ARE IN PHASE WITH CHANGES IN AIR TEMPERATURE, AND INFLUENCED BY FRICTION VELOCITY AND VAPOR PRESSURE DEFICIT (VPD). ON WEEKLY-TO-MONTHLY TIMESCALES, SOIL TEMPERATURE CAN EXPLAIN MOST OF THE VARIATION IN CH4 EXCHANGE.

GROUNDWATER DEPTH WAS MEASURED MANUALLY OR BY SENSOR FROM 2012 TO 2017. GROUNDWATER AT BOTH SLOPE POSITIONS FLUCTUATED COMMONLY 1.5 TO 2 M ANNUALLY AND CONTRIBUTED TO SEASONAL INUNDATION IN DEPRESSIONS. DIRECTION OF VERTICAL HYDRAULIC GRADIENT REVERSED REGULARLY, BUT WAS MORE COMMONLY DOWNWARD AT TOE SLOPES, INDICATING RECHARGE DOMINANCE. AN EQUAL BALANCE OF UPWARD AND DOWNWARD FLOW GRADIENTS IN DEPRESSIONS WAS INTERPRETED AS FLOW-THROUGH. LATERAL HYDRAULIC GRADIENTS WERE COMMONLY POSITIVE FROM TOE TO DEPRESSION. COUNTS OF SUBGROUPS FOR DEPRESSIONS WERE ORTHIC HUMIC GLEYSOL (3), ORTHIC LUVIC GLEYSOL (2), TERRIC MESISOL (2), ORTHIC GLEYSOL (2) TERRIC HUMISOL (1) AND HUMIC LUVIC GLEYSOL (1). COUNTS OF SUBGROUPS FOR TOE SLOPES WERE GLEYED DARK GRAY CHEMOZEM (2), GLEYED SOLONETZIC GRAY LUVISOL (2), GLEYED DARK GRAY LUVISOL (2), DARK GRAY SOLODIZED SOLONETZ (1), DARK GRAY LUVISOL (1), GRAY SOLODIZED SOLONETZ (1), AND HUMIC LUVIC GLEYSOL (1). THE INFREQUENCY OF ELUVIAL/ILLUVIAL SOIL FEATURES IN DEPRESSIONS WAS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR FLOW-THROUGH HYDROLOGY. THE HIGHER FREQUENCY OF ELUVIAL/ILLUVIAL SOIL FEATURES AT TOE SLOPES WAS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH RECHARGE HYDROLOGY. SOIL CARBONATES WERE MORE ABUNDANT WITHIN THE WEAKLY SALINE SOIL UNIT. THE SEASONAL HYDROLOGIC PATTERN IN DEPRESSIONS INCLUDED A PERIOD OF RAPID GROUNDWATER RISE DURING SNOWMELT, A PERIOD OF STABILITY MAINTAINED BY INPUTS OF PRECIPITATION AND TOE SLOPE FLUX, AND A PERIOD OF GROUNDWATER RECESSION THAT WAS PROBABLY INITIATED WHEN FOREST ET DEPLETED UPLAND SOIL MOISTURE. MINERAL WETLANDS WITH GLEYSOLIC SOILS ARE FOUND IN LOCATIONS OF THE LANDSCAPE WHERE SOIL SATURATION IS TOO IRREGULAR TO ALLOW PEATLAND FORMATION.

ONE WAY TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THE POTENTIAL LONG TERM INFLUENCES OF WILDFIRES ON ECOSYSTEMS AND THE CLIMATE SYSTEM ITSELF IS TO STUDY PALAEO-WILDFIRES. A TOTAL OF 140 JURASSIC SAMPLES, INCLUDING 122 COAL SAMPLES AND 18 ROCK SAMPLES FROM ROOF AND FLOOR OF COAL SEAMS, WERE COLLECTED FROM 4 COALFIELDS IN NORTHWESTERN CHINA. THE SAMPLES WERE ANALYZED BY MACROPETROGRAPHY, MICROSCOPY, SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY, AND GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROMETRY TO STUDY THE EVIDENCES OF WILDFIRES AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE PALEOCLIMATE. HIGH CONTENTS OF PYROGENIC INERTINITES (CHARCOAL), NATURAL CHAR AND NATURAL COKE PARTICLES OBSERVED IN THE SAMPLES WHICH INDICATE THAT WIDESPREAD WILDFIRE EVENTS OCCURRED IN THE EARLY MIDDLE JURASSIC IN ALL OVER NORTHWESTERN CHINA. ADDITIONALLY, HIGH-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS WERE DETECTED IN THE COAL SAMPLES. THESE AROMATIC COMPOUNDS WERE FORMED UNDER HIGH TEMPERATURE AND PROVIDE FURTHER EVIDENCE OF WILDFIRES. ACCORDING TO A CARBON EMISSION MODEL FOR MODERN FOREST FIRES, THE TOTAL CARBON AND GAS EMISSIONS FROM WILDFIRES IN PEAT SWAMPS OF THE MIDDLE JURASSIC IN NORTHWEST CHINA WERE CALCULATED BY THE DATA FROM 21,575 COAL SAMPLES OF NUMBER OF 1567 DRILL CORE SAMPLES. THE TOTAL CARBON RELEASED FROM PEAT-SWAMP FOREST WILDFIRES WAS AT LEAST 1207 GT, CORRESPONDING TO EMISSIONS OF CO2, CO AND CH4 OF 1926 GT, 163 GT, AND 8.8 GT, RESPECTIVELY.

IT IS ALSO NOT CONDUCIVE FOR RESEARCHERS TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE ON REGIONAL C-3/C-4 VEGETATION.

THEREFORE, IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO RECONSTRUCT THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF C-3/C-4 VEGETATION IN SOUTHERN CHINA AND CLARIFY THE INFLUENCING MECHANISM OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IN THIS STUDY, WE SYSTEMATICALLY ANALYZED STABLE CARBON ISOTOPE (DELTA C-13) OF THE LONG-CHAIN N-ALKANES IN SEDIMENT SAMPLES FROM EIGHT LAKES AND FOUR PEAT PROFILES IN SOUTHERN CHINA, TO RECONSTRUCT THE SPATIOTEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF C-3/C-4 VEGETATION IN THESE REGIONS SINCE THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM (LGM) AND TO INVESTIGATE THE CLIMATE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE C-4 PLANT ABUNDANCE CHANGE IN THE RESEARCH AREA. THE INTEGRATED LONG-CHAIN N-ALKANE (C-27-C-33) STABLE CARBON ISOTOPE RESULTS OF SAMPLES FROM ZHANJIANG HUGUANGYAN MAAR LAKE, XINGYUN LAKE, LUGU LAKE AND DINGNAN PEAT SHOWED THAT, FROM THE LGM TO THE EARLY HOLOCENE, C-4 PLANT RELATIVE ABUNDANCE EXHIBITED A GRADUALLY INCREASING TREND FROM 21% TO 34%.

WE PERFORMED A PARTIAL CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS (PCCA) TO DETERMINE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF WATER QUALITY, SPATIAL, AND CLIMATIC VARIABLES FOR PATTERNS IN SPECIES COMPOSITION AND TO COMPARE THE DIFFERENCES IN THESE PATTERNS BETWEEN WETLAND AND MATRIX-DERIVED SPECIES.

SPATIAL VARIABLES EXPLAINED THE LEAST VARIATION (21.53%). WHEN LOOKING AT THE VARIABLES INDIVIDUALLY, ALTITUDE (10.93%) AND MEAN SUMMER TEMPERATURE (9.25%) EXPLAINED THE MOST VARIATION. THE TREND WAS THE SAME FOR MATRIX-DERIVED SPECIES AND WETLAND SPECIES, WITH CLIMATIC VARIABLES EXPLAINING THE MOST VARIATION (MATRIX-DERIVED: 27.26%; WETLAND: 24.42%), FOLLOWED BY WATER QUALITY (MATRIX-DERIVED: 26.40%; WETLAND: 24.13%) AND SPATIAL VARIABLES (MATRIX-DERIVED: 24.87%; WETLAND: 16.27%).

IN THESE SYSTEMS, ENCHYTRAEID WORMS REPRESENT THE DOMINANT MESOFAUNAL GROUP, AND PREVIOUS CLIMATE CHANGE MANIPULATIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT THEIR ABUNDANCES AND VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION ARE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE GRADIENTS, WITH IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR C CYCLING. THEREFORE, DETERMINING THEIR BEHAVIOURAL RESPONSES TO CHANGES IN BOTH ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC FACTORS IS CRUCIAL TO QUANTIFY THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO DECOMPOSITION PROCESSES.

THIS MANIPULATIVE EXPERIMENT WAS SET UP IN TWO DIFFERENT PEATLAND AREAS, ONE DOMINATED BY HEATHER (ERICA MACKAIANA) AND ANOTHER BY MOSSES (SPHAGNUM SP.)

IN THE 'UPTURNED CORES', THEY REMAINED IN THE SAME LAYER WHERE THEY ARE 'NORMALLY' LOCATED), AND HENCE, THEIR VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION WAS MORE DEPENDENT ON SUBSTRATE QUALITY THAN A CHANGE IN MICROCLIMATE. THIS RESPONSE WAS MORE EVIDENT UNDER DRIER CONDITIONS (I.E. THE HIGHEST LOCATIONS OF THE HEIGHT GRADIENT AT THE HEATHER SITE) THAN AT THE WETTEST LOCATIONS (I.E.

ALTHOUGH N ADDITION ALONE DID NOT ALTER CH4 EMISSIONS, IT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF WARMING ON CH4 FLUXES. WE ATTRIBUTED THIS FINDING TO THREE POSSIBLE REASONS: (1) N ADDITION CAUSED A SHIFT IN ROOT ALLOCATION FROM DEEP TO SHALLOW ROOTS, WHICH DECREASED LABILE SUBSTRATES FOR CH4 PRODUCTION UNDER WARMING; (2) WARMING PROMOTED VEGETATION UPTAKE OF AMMONIUM (NH4+), WHICH ALLEVIATED THE INHIBITION OF NH4+ TO METHANOTROPHS AND SUBSEQUENTLY INCREASED CH4 OXIDATION UNDER N ADDITION; AND (3) THE COMBINATION OF WARMING AND N ADDITION INCREASED MAINTENANCE RESPIRATION OF VASCULAR PLANTS COMPARED WITH WARMING ALONE, THUS REDUCING NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION AND ROOT EXUDATES FOR CH4 PRODUCTION.

RESULTS CLEARLY REVEAL THE PREFERENTIAL DEGRADATION UNDER AEROBIC CONDITIONS OF MID-CHAIN N-ALKANES RELATIVE TO THEIR LONG-CHAIN HOMOLOGS (C-29 AND C-31), RESULTING IN THE INCREASE OF THE RELATIVE PROPORTIONS OF LONG-CHAIN N-ALKANES.

MATERIALS AND METHODS INCUBATION OF HIGH-MOOR PEAT SOILS COLLECTED FROM MARSH VEGETATION AND DWARF BAMBOO WAS CONDUCTED FOR 108 DAYS AT EACH TEMPERATURE OF 25 DEGREES C AND 35 DEGREES C. THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ALKALINE EXTRACT AND DOM IN SOIL SAMPLES DURING INCUBATION WERE ANALYZED BY TETRAMETHYLAMMONIUM HYDROXIDE THERMOCHEMOLYSIS-GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROMETRY (TMAH-GC/MS) AND FLUORESCENCE ANALYSIS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION THE CUMULATIVE CO2 EMISSION FROM PEAT UNDER DWARF BAMBOO WAS HIGHER THAN THAT OF PEAT UNDER MARSH VEGETATION.

ON THE OTHER HAND, THE COMPONENTS OF DOM IN THE MARSH VEGETATION SOIL SAMPLE DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE BETWEEN INCUBATION AT EACH TEMPERATURE.

THE MAIN FACTORS THAT DETERMINE THE DEPTH OF FREEZING OF WETLANDS ARE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE, SNOW COVER THICKNESS, AND A DEGREE OF WATERING OF THE MICRO LANDSCAPE (WATER RESERVES OF THE MICRO LANDSCAPE). AT THE INITIAL STAGE OF FREEZING, THE MAJOR FACTOR IS THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE, WHEN INTENSITY OF THE FREEZING REACHES 0.5-0.8 CM/DAY. AS SNOW FALLS, THE FREEZING RATE BECOMES SMALLER, AND WHEN THE SNOW COVER THICKNESS REACHES 25-30 CM THE DEPTH AMOUNTS TO 0.2-0.3 CM/DAY AND SMALLER. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF THE FREEZING DEPTH DECREASES FROM LARGE VALUES OF THE COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION (0.3-0.4) AT THE DEPTH OF 20-30 CM TO LESS THAN 0.1 WHEN THE DEPTH EXCEEDS 60 CM.

BECAUSE HYDROLOGY IS THE PRIMARY FACTOR INFLUENCING WETLAND STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION, THE IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THAT WETLANDS PROVIDE MAY BE ALTERED OR LOST AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WHILE A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECTED IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON WETLANDS, HYDROLOGIC MODELS AND DOWNSCALED CLIMATE MODEL PROJECTIONS PROVIDE TOOLS TO REDUCE THIS UNCERTAINTY. DRAINMOD IS ONE SUCH PROCESS-BASED HYDROLOGIC MODEL THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ADAPTED TO SIMULATE THE DAILY WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS IN NATURAL WETLANDS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT WAS TO DETERMINE THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE HYDROLOGIC REGIMES OF NON-RIVERINE, NON-TIDAL COASTAL PLAIN WETLANDS IN NORTH CAROLINA. DRAINMOD MODELS WERE CALIBRATED AND VALIDATED FOR TWO MINIMALLY DISTURBED, NATURAL WETLAND SITES USING OBSERVED WATER TABLE AND LOCAL WEATHER DATA. TWO REPRESENTATIVE CONCENTRATION PATHWAY (RCP) SCENARIOS WERE EVALUATED: RCP4.5 AND RCP8.5. NINE MODELS WERE SELECTED FROM AN ENSEMBLE OF 32 CLIMATE MODELS TO REPRESENT THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE CHANGES IN MEAN PRECIPITATION AND TEMPERATURE. DOWNSCALED CLIMATE PROJECTIONS WERE OBTAINED FROM THE U.S. BUREAU OF RECLAMATION. SIMULATIONS WERE RUN FROM 1986 TO 2099, AND RESULTS WERE EVALUATED BY COMPARING THE PROJECTED MEAN WATER TABLE LEVELS BETWEEN THE BASE PERIOD (1986-2015) AND TWO FUTURE EVALUATION PERIODS: 2040-2069 AND 2070-2099. THE MODEL SIMULATION RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE PROJECTED MEAN WATER TABLE LEVEL MAY DECLINE BY AS MUCH AS 25 TO 84 CM BY THE END OF THIS CENTURY (2070-2099) FOR THE RCP8.5 SCENARIO AND MAY DECLINE BY 4 TO 61 CM FOR THE RCP4.5 SCENARIO. IN COASTAL PLAIN WETLANDS, DECLINES IN WATER TABLES CAN LEAD TO THE SUBSIDENCE OF ORGANIC SOILS, WHICH CAN LEAD TO THE LOSS OF STORED CARBON AND INCREASED RISK OF PEAT FIRES. LOWER MEAN WATER LEVELS CAN ALSO LEAD TO SHIFTS IN VEGETATION COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND LOSS OF HABITAT FUNCTIONS FOR WETLAND-DEPENDENT FAUNA. THESE RESULTS PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON NORTH CAROLINA WETLANDS, AND THEY PROVIDE A RANGE OF SCENARIOS TO INFORM AND GUIDE POSSIBLE CHANGES TO WATER MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES IN WETLAND ECOSYSTEMS THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED NOW TO LIMIT THE LOSS OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES OVER THE LONG TERM.","THE POTENTIAL LONG-TERM IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE HYDROLOGIC REGIMES OF NORTH CAROLINA'S COASTAL PLAIN NON-RIVERINE WETLANDS","TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE","ARTICLE",NA,2019,"10.13031/trans.13437","AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING","WOS:000510172900015"

THE PRODUCED HYDROCHAR IS MADE SUITABLE FOR AGRICULTURAL APPLICATIONS BY REMOVING PLANT GROWING INHIBITORY SUBSTANCES. WET HOUSEHOLD WASTE SUCH AS FRUIT PEEL, COFFEE GROUNDS, INEDIBLE VEGETABLE PARTS, OR WET LIGNOCELLULOSIC MATERIAL IN GENERAL, ARE TREATED IN PRESENCE OF WATER AT 215 DEGREES C AND 21 BAR IN AN AUTOCLAVE, I.E., BY HYDROTHERMAL CARBONIZATION. ALL THESE LEFTOVERS HAVE A CONSIDERABLE WATER CONTENT OF UP TO 90 WEIGHT % (WT%). ADDING WATER EXTENDS THE PROCEDURE TO DRIER MATERIALS SUCH AS NUTSHELLS OR EVEN GARDEN PRUNINGS AND COMPOSTABLE POLYMERS, I.E., THE PLASTIC BAG FOR COLLECTION OF THE LEFTOVERS. USUALLY, THE RESULTING CARBON MATERIAL, CALLED HYDROCHAR, PRODUCES A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON PLANT GROWTH WHEN ADDED TO SOIL. IT IS SUPPOSED THAT THIS EFFECT IS CAUSED BY ADSORBED PHYTOTOXIC COMPOUNDS. A SIMPLE POST-TREATMENT UNDER INERT ATMOSPHERE (ABSENCE OF OXYGEN) AT 275 DEGREES C REMOVES THESE SUBSTANCES. THEREFORE, THE RAW HYDROCHAR IS PLACED ON A GLASS FRIT OF A VERTICAL TUBULAR QUARTZ REACTOR. A NITROGEN GAS FLOW IS APPLIED IN DOWN-FLOW DIRECTION. THE TUBE IS HEATED TO THE DESIRED TEMPERATURE BY MEANS OF A HEATING MANTLE FOR UP TO ONE HOUR. THE SUCCESS OF THE THERMAL TREATMENT IS EASILY QUANTIFIED BY THERMOGRAVIMETRY (TG), CARRIED OUT IN AIR. A WEIGHT LOSS IS DETERMINED WHEN THE TEMPERATURE OF 275 DEGREES C IS REACHED, SINCE VOLATILE CONTENT IS DESORBED. ITS AMOUNT IS REDUCED IN THE FINAL MATERIAL, IN COMPARISON TO THE UNTREATED HYDROCHAR. THE TWO-STEP TREATMENT CONVERTS HOUSEHOLD LEFTOVERS, INCLUDING COMPOSTABLE BAGS EMPLOYED FOR THEIR COLLECTION, INTO A CARBON MATERIAL THAT MAY SERVE AS PLANT GROWTH PROMOTER AND, AT THE SAME TIME, AS A CARBON SINK FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION.","TRANSFORMATION OF ORGANIC HOUSEHOLD LEFTOVERS INTO A PEAT SUBSTITUTE","JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS","ARTICLE","JUL",2019,"10.3791/59569","MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES","WOS:000478806500019"

HERE, WE EVALUATE SUMMED ANHYDROSUGARS (SAS) AS A PALEOFIRE INDICATOR IN A 6000 YEAR-LONG FOSSIL CORE FROM AGIOS FLOROS FEN, PELOPONNESE, GREECE, BY ANALYZING CHARCOAL FRAGMENTS IN PARALLEL, THROUGHOUT THE SEDIMENT SEQUENCE. MODERN SURFACE SOIL SAMPLES FROM THE SAME REGION WERE ANALYSED FOR THE PRESENCE OF SAS, CONFIRMING THE BIOMARKER AS AN INDICATOR OF RECENT FIRE ACTIVITY. THE HIGHEST SAS CONCENTRATIONS IN THE FOSSIL CORE WERE FOUND IN SECTIONS REPRESENTING PERIODS OF WET CONDITIONS, BOTH ON LOCAL AND REGIONAL SCALES AND REGIONALLY WIDESPREAD ARBOREAL VEGETATION. LOW AMOUNTS, OR THE ABSENCE, OF SAS IN THE FOSSIL CORE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH PERIODS OF DRYNESS, REGIONAL DOMINANCE OF NON-ARBOREAL VEGETATION AND THE PRESENCE OF A FEN RATHER THAN A LAKE ECOSYSTEM AT THE SITE. MICRO-CHARCOAL FRAGMENTS WERE GENERALLY MORE ABUNDANT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT SAS YIELD AND DEPOSITION MAY VARY WITH FUEL AVAILABILITY AND FIRE BEHAVIOR, WHICH IN TURN IS AFFECTED BY CLIMATE, LOCAL MOISTURE AND VEGETATION TYPE. FOREST FIRES RESULT IN MORE SAS COMPARED TO GRASS FIRES. SAS YIELD IS ALSO FAVORED BY LOW-TEMPERATURE FIRES SUSTAINED UNDER WET CLIMATE CONDITIONS. PRESERVATION OF SAS IS LIKELY TO BE COMPROMISED IN THE ONLY SEASONALLY WET FEN ECOSYSTEM UNDER THE DRY AND WARM MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE CONDITIONS. THE MOIST AND SHALLOW CONDITIONS IN THE WETLAND DURING HOT SUMMER MONTHS PROBABLY PROMOTE OXIDATION AND BIODEGRADATION OF THE LABILE SAS MOLECULES, COMPARED TO THE MORE ROBUST CHARCOAL FRAGMENTS.

WE USED A FULLY FACTORIAL INCUBATION EXPERIMENT TO EXAMINE THE INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE (8, 26, AND 35 DEGREES C) AND REDOX (OXIC AND ANOXIC) CONDITIONS ON CO2 PRODUCTION, CH4 FLUXES, FE REDUCTION, MICROBIAL BIOMASS C, AND THE MICROBIAL METABOLIC QUOTIENT (MMQ) IN UPLAND SOILS FROM TWO CONTRASTING CLIMATE REGIMES AND REDOX ENVIRONMENTS: A TROPICAL FOREST IN PUERTO RICO (PR) AND A TEMPERATE PEATLAND IN CALIFORNIA (CA). UNDER OXIC CONDITIONS, WE FOUND THAT CO2 PRODUCTION INCREASED ACROSS BOTH TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS (8-26 DEGREES C AND 26-35 DEGREES C). IN CONTRAST, UNDER ANOXIC CONDITIONS, NET CH4 FLUXES AND FE REDUCTION EXHIBITED A GREATER TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY BETWEEN 26 AND 35 DEGREES C THAN 8-26 DEGREES C IN BOTH PR AND CA SOILS. WE ALSO OBSERVED COUPLING BETWEEN FE REDUCTION AND NET CH4 FLUXES IN PR AND CA SOILS CONSISTENT WITH COMPETITION FOR ACETATE. THE ANOXIC MMQ INCREASED IN PR SOILS AT HIGH TEMPERATURE, BUT NOT IN CA SOILS, SUGGESTING THAT THE NATIVE PR ENVIRONMENT MAY FAVOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE EFFICIENT MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES BETTER ABLE TO TOLERATE WARMER, WETTER CONDITIONS. TOGETHER, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ANAEROBIC MICROBIAL METABOLISMS MAY BE MUCH MORE SENSITIVE TO HIGHER TEMPERATURE THAN AEROBIC ONES, POSSIBLY DUE TO PROPORTIONALLY GREATER ANAEROBIC MICROBIAL ACTIVITY AT HIGH TEMPERATURE.

IN QUANTITATIVE TERMS, THE CLIMATE NORMAL IS A PARAMETER OF ANY CHARACTERISTIC OF CLIMATE OF ATMOSPHERE OR SOIL SAMPLED FROM 1961 TO 1990 IN A DAILY, TEN-DAY, MONTHLY, SEASONAL, OR ANNUAL CYCLE. CURRENTLY, CLIMATIC CHANGES OCCUR ON GLOBAL, CONTINENTAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL. ON THE GLOBAL LEVEL, ESPECIALLY STRONG CLIMATE WARMING HAS BEEN OBSERVED OVER THE PAST 100 YEARS: THE AVERAGE TEN-YEAR AIR TEMPERATURE INCREASED, AS COMPARED WITH ITS LOWEST (1891-1900), BY 1.2-1.3 DEGREES C BY NOW. MODERN WARMING HAS AFFECTED ALL CONTINENTS, WHILE THE AIR TEMPERATURE ON THE CONTINENTS HAS INCREASED, AS COMPARED WITH THE CLIMATE NORMAL, BY 0.3-1.5 DEGREES C. ANALYSIS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE REGIONAL LEVEL WAS CARRIED OUT DURING THE PERIOD OF EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS (1921-2015) BY THE EXAMPLE OF SOILS IN THE ZONAL RANGE OF THE EUROPEAN PART OF RUSSIA: PEAT GLEYZEMS OF FOREST-TUNDRA, PODZOLIC SOILS OF MIDDLE TAIGA, SOD-PODZOLIC SOILS OF SOUTHERN TAIGA, AND LIGHT-CHESTNUT SOILS OF DRY STEPPE. IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT EACH SOIL IS CHARACTERIZED BY A CERTAIN NORMAL OF CLIMATIC PARAMETERS. FOR ZONAL SERIES OF SOILS UNDER RESEARCH IT WAS SHOWN THAT THE CURRENT CLIMATE WARMING IS ACCOMPANIED BY THE INCREASE IN AIR AND SOIL TEMPERATURE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, BY DISPLACEMENT OF SOIL-CLIMATIC ZONES IN THE NORTH. THE CURRENT CLIMATE WARMING, ACCORDING TO THE TEMPERATURE PARAMETER, HAS BECOME COMMENSURATE WITH THE CLIMATIC OPTIMUM OF THE HOLOCENE. FAVORABLE CONDITIONS ARE CREATED FOR PROMOTION OF FOREST COMMUNITIES TO THE NORTH, WHICH MAY LEAD TO DEVELOPMENT OF A PODZOLIC TYPE OF SOIL FORMATION IN FOREST-OCCUPIED TUNDRA TERRITORIES. FOR FOREST SOILS OF THE NORTHERN AND MIDDLE TAIGA, UNDER CONDITIONS OF THE CURRENT CLIMATE WARMING, SOIL FORMATION WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY WEAKENING PODZOLIC SOIL AND INTENSIFICATION OF SOD SOIL-FORMING PROCESSES. ONE CAN ALSO EXPECT INCREASE IN ARIDIZATION AND SALINIZATION OF CHESTNUT SOILS OF DRY STEPPES.","SOIL EVOLUTION IN RELATION TO MODERN CLIMATE WARMING","THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY","ARTICLE",NA,2017,NA,"ECOLOGY","WOS:000468547000007"

THE DEMISE OF PICEA FORESTS/WOODLANDS DURING THE LAST DEGLACIATION OFFERS A MODEL SYSTEM FOR STUDYING HOW CHANGING CLIMATE AND DISTURBANCE REGIMES INTERACT TO TRIGGER DECLINES OF DOMINANT SPECIES AND VEGETATION-TYPE CONVERSIONS. THE ROLE OF RISING TEMPERATURES IN DRIVING THE REGIONAL DEMISE OF PICEA FORESTS/WOODLANDS IS WIDELY ACCEPTED, BUT THE ROLE OF FIRE IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. WE STUDIED THE EFFECT OF CHANGING FIRE ACTIVITY ON PICEA DECLINES AND RATES OF VEGETATION COMPOSITION CHANGE USING FOSSIL POLLEN AND MACROSCOPIC CHARCOAL FROM FIVE HIGH-RESOLUTION LAKE SEDIMENT RECORDS. THE DECLINE OF PICEA FORESTS/WOODLANDS FOLLOWED TWO DISTINCT PATTERNS. AT TWO SITES (STOTZEL-LEIS AND SILVER LAKE), FIRE ACTIVITY REACHED MAXIMUM LEVELS DURING THE DECLINES AND BOTH CHARCOAL ACCUMULATION RATES AND FIRE FREQUENCY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY AND POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH VEGETATION COMPOSITION CHANGE RATES. AT THESE SITES, PICEA DECLINED TO LOW LEVELS BY 14 KYR BP AND WAS LARGELY REPLACED BY DECIDUOUS HARDWOOD TAXA LIKE ASH FRAXINUS, HOP-HORNBEAM/HORNBEAM OSTRYA/CARPINUS AND ELM ULMUS. HOWEVER, THIS ECOSYSTEM TRANSITION WAS REVERSIBLE, AS PICEA RE-ESTABLISHED AT LOWER ABUNDANCES DURING THE YOUNGER DRYAS. AT THE OTHER THREE SITES, THERE WAS NO STATISTICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHARCOAL ACCUMULATION AND VEGETATION COMPOSITION CHANGE RATES, THOUGH FIRE FREQUENCY WAS A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF RATES OF VEGETATION CHANGE AT APPLEMAN LAKE AND TRIANGLE LAKE BOG.

HETEROGENEOUS PERMAFROST LANDSCAPES ARE OFTEN DOMINATED BY POLYGONAL FEATURES FORMED BY EXPANDING ICE WEDGES: WATER ACCUMULATES IN LOW CENTERED POLYGONS (LCPS), AND WATER DRAINS OUTWARD TO SURROUNDING TROUGHS IN HIGH CENTERED POLYGONS (HCPS). THESE GEOSPATIAL DIFFERENCES IN HYDROLOGY CAUSE GRADIENTS IN BIOGEOCHEMISTRY, SOIL C STORAGE POTENTIAL, AND THERMAL PROPERTIES. PRESENTLY, DATA QUANTIFYING CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) AND METHANE (CH4) RELEASE FROM HCP SOILS ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT MODELING AND EVALUATION OF WARMING-INDUCED CO2 AND CH4 FLUXES FROM TUNDRA SOILS. THIS STUDY QUANTIFIES THE DISTRIBUTION OF MICROBIAL CO2 AND CH4 RELEASE IN HCPS OVER A RANGE OF TEMPERATURES AND DRAWS COMPARISONS TO PREVIOUS LCP STUDIES. ARCTIC TUNDRA SOILS WERE INITIALLY CHARACTERIZED FOR GEOCHEMICAL AND HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES. LABORATORY INCUBATIONS AT -2, +4, AND +8 DEGREES C WERE USED TO QUANTIFY TEMPORAL TRENDS IN CO2 AND CH4 PRODUCTION FROM HOMOGENIZED ACTIVE LAYER ORGANIC AND MINERAL SOILS IN HCP CENTERS AND TROUGHS, AND METHANOGEN ABUNDANCE WAS ESTIMATED FROM MCRA GENE MEASUREMENTS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT SOIL WATER AVAILABILITY, ORGANIC C, AND REDOX CONDITIONS INFLUENCE TEMPORAL DYNAMICS AND MAGNITUDE OF GAS PRODUCTION FROM HCP ACTIVE LAYER SOILS DURING WARMING. AT EARLY INCUBATION TIMES (2-9 DAYS), HIGHER CO2 EMISSIONS WERE OBSERVED FROM HCP TROUGH SOILS THAN FROM HCP CENTER SOILS, BUT INCREASED CO2 PRODUCTION OCCURRED IN CENTER SOILS AT LATER TIMES (>20 DAYS). HCP CENTER SOILS DID NOT SUPPORT METHANOGENESIS, BUT CH4-PRODUCING TROUGH SOILS DID INDICATE METHANOGEN PRESENCE. CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS LCP STUDIES, HCP ORGANIC SOILS SHOWED INCREASED CO2 AND CH4 PRODUCTION WITH ELEVATED WATER CONTENT, BUT HCP TROUGH MINERAL SOILS PRODUCED MORE CH4 THAN LCP MINERAL SOILS. HCP MINERAL SOILS ALSO RELEASED SUBSTANTIAL CO2 BUT DID NOT SHOW A STRONG TREND IN CO2 AND CH4 RELEASE WITH WATER CONTENT.

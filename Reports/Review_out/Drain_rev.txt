WE PROVIDE A QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATION OF THE CARBON ABSORPTION POTENTIAL PER HECTARE AND THE SURFACE OF AGRICULTURAL LAND THAT IS AVAILABLE AND SUITABLE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE MEASURES, THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS ON FARM INCOME. REALISTICALLY, AGRICULTURAL SOILS IN EU-15 CAN SEQUESTER UP TO 16-19 MT C YEAR(-1) DURING THE FIRST KYOTO COMMITMENT PERIOD (2008-2012), WHICH IS LESS THAN ONE FIFTH OF THE THEORETICAL POTENTIAL AND EQUIVALENT TO 2% OF EUROPEAN ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS. WE IDENTIFIED AS MOST PROMISING MEASURES: THE PROMOTION OF ORGANIC INPUTS ON ARABLE LAND INSTEAD OF GRASSLAND, THE INTRODUCTION OF PERENNIALS (GRASSES, TREES) ON ARABLE SET-ASIDE LAND FOR CONSERVATION OR BIOFUEL PURPOSES, TO PROMOTE ORGANIC FARMING, TO RAISE THE WATER TABLE IN FANNED PEATLAND, AND-WITH RESTRICTIONS-ZERO TILLAGE OR CONSERVATION TILLAGE. MANY OPTIONS HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS BUT SOME RISK OF INCREASING N2O EMISSIONS. FOR MOST MEASURES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE OVERALL IMPACT ON FARM PROFITABILITY. EFFICIENT CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN AGRICULTURAL SOILS DEMANDS A PERMANENT MANAGEMENT CHANGE AND IMPLEMENTATION CONCEPTS ADJUSTED TO LOCAL SOIL, CLIMATE AND MANAGEMENT FEATURES IN ORDER TO ALLOW SELECTION OF AREAS WITH HIGH CARBON SEQUESTERING POTENTIAL. SOME OF THE PRESENT AGRICULTURAL POLICY SCHEMES HAVE PROBABLY HELPED TO MAINTAIN CARBON STOCKS IN AGRICULTURAL SOILS. (C) 2004 ELSEVIER B.V.

DESPITE THEIR POTENTIAL FOR LARGE POSITIVE FEEDBACKS TO THE CLIMATE SYSTEM THROUGH SEQUESTRATION AND EMISSION OF GREENHOUSE GASES, PEATLANDS ARE NOT EXPLICITLY INCLUDED IN GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELS AND THEREFORE IN PREDICTIONS OF FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE. IN APRIL 2007 A SYMPOSIUM WAS HELD IN WAGENINGEN, THE NETHERLANDS, TO ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF PEATLAND C CYCLING.

THE MAIN DRIVERS CONTROLLING MOST ARE RELATED TO SOME ASPECTS OF HYDROLOGY. DESPITE HIGH SPATIAL AND ANNUAL VARIABILITY IN NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE ( NEE), THE DIFFERENCES IN CUMULATIVE ANNUAL NEE ARE MORE A FUNCTION OF BROAD SCALE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND PHYSICAL SETTING THAN INTERNAL FACTORS, SUGGESTING THE EXISTENCE OF STRONG FEEDBACKS. IN CONTRAST, TRACE GAS EMISSIONS SEEM MAINLY CONTROLLED BY LOCAL FACTORS. KEY UNCERTAINTIES REMAIN CONCERNING THE EXISTENCE OF PERTURBATION THRESHOLDS, THE RELATIVE STRENGTHS OF THE CO2 AND CH4 FEEDBACK, THE LINKS AMONG PEATLAND SURFACE CLIMATE, HYDROLOGY, ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION, AND TRACE GAS BIOGEOCHEMISTRY AS WELL AS THE SIMILARITY OF PROCESS RATES ACROSS PEATLAND TYPES AND CLIMATIC ZONES.

PARTICULARLY FOR LAND AREAS SOUTH OF 70 DEGREES N. THIS IS LIKELY TO CAUSE WIDESPREAD IMPACTS ON ARCTIC HYDROLOGY, ECOLOGY, AND TRACE GAS EMISSIONS. HERE. WE PRESENT A REVIEW OF RECENT STUDIES INVESTIGATING LINKAGES BETWEEN PERMAFROST DYNAMICS AND RIVER BIOGEOCHEMISTRY IN THE ARCTIC, INCLUDING CONSIDERATION OF LIKELY IMPACTS THAT WARMING-INDUCED CHANGES IN PERMAFROST MAY BE HAVING (OR WILL HAVE IN THE FUTURE) OIL THE DELIVERY OF ORGANIC MATTER, INORGANIC NUTRIENTS, AND MAJOR IONS TO THE ARCTIC OCEAN. THESE INTERACTING PROCESSES CAN BE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND UNDOUBTEDLY EXHIBIT SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT PERMAFROST CONDITIONS, SENSITIVITY TO PERMAFROST THAW, MODE OF PERMAFROST DEGRADATION (OVERALL PERMAFROST THAW, ACTIVE LAYER DEEPENING, AND/OR THERMOKARST PROCESSES), AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS OF WATERSHEDS (E.G. LAND COVER, SOIL TYPE, AND TOPOGRAPHY). ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES OF PERMAFROST THAW PROJECTED FOR THE FUTURE IS THAT THE ARCTIC TERRESTRIAL FRESHWATER SYSTEM IS LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE A TRANSITION FROM A SURFACE WATER-DOMINATED SYSTEM TO A GROUNDWATER-DOMINATED SYSTEM. ALONG WITH MANY OTHER CASCADING IMPACTS FROM THIS TRANSITION, MINERAL-RICH GROUNDWATER MAY BECOME AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO STREAMFLOW, IN ADDITION TO THE CURRENTLY DOMINANT CONTRIBUTION FROM MINERAL-POOR SURFACE WATER. MOST STUDIES OBSERVE OR PREDICT AN INCREASE IN MAJOR ION, PHOSPHATE, AND SILICATE EXPORT WITH THIS SHIFT TOWARDS GREATER GROUNDWATER CONTRIBUTIONS. HOWEVER, WE SEE CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS OF WHETHER THE DELIVERY OF INORGANIC NITROGEN AND ORGANIC MATTER WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE WITH WARMING AND PERMAFROST THAW. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT UNCERTAINTIES IN THE PREDICTIONS OF THE TOTAL FLUX OF BIOGEOCHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS ARE TIGHTLY LINKED TO FUTURE UNCERTAINTIES IN DISCHARGE OF RIVERS. NONETHELESS, IT IS CLEAR THAT OVER THE NEXT CENTURY THERE WILL BE IMPORTANT SHIFTS IN THE RIVER TRANSPORT OF ORGANIC MATTER, INORGANIC NUTRIENTS, AND MAJOR IONS.

THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THESE PROBLEMS AND EXAMINES THE EVIDENCE FOR CHANGES IN HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE CHANGES. TRADITIONAL BLACK-BOX WATER BALANCE APPROACHES DEMONSTRATE LITTLE ABOUT WETLAND DYNAMICS AND THEREFORE THE SCIENCE OF CATCHMENT RESPONSE TO PEAT DRAINAGE IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH PEAT DRAINAGE HAVE LED, IN PART, TO A RECENT REVERSAL IN ATTITUDES TO PEATLANDS AND WE HAVE SEEN A MOVE TOWARDS WETLAND RESTORATION.

PEATLAND EFFECTS ON CARBON CYCLING INVOLVE CHANGES IN BOTH LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. THE RATE OF C SEQUESTRATION DECLINES AS A PEAT DEPOSIT GROWS, AND METHANE EMISSION INCREASES AS WET MICROHABITATS EXPAND IN AREA. WE EXAMINE THE THEORETICAL BASIS, UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR TWO HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL MODELS OF PEATLAND FORM AND DEVELOPMENT: CLYMO'S BOG GROWTH MODEL (BGM) AND INGRAM'S GROUNDWATER MOUND HYPOTHESIS (GMH). OUR DETAILED THEORETICAL ANALYSIS REVEALS PREVIOUSLY UNRECOGNIZED CONSEQUENCES OF THE MODELS AND, FOR THE BGM, UNREALISTICALLY STRINGENT CONDITIONS FOR APPLICATION. OUR REVIEW OF MODEL ASSUMPTIONS AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IDENTIFIES THE PRINCIPAL LIMITATIONS OF THESE MODELS: THEY IGNORE SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY IN PEATLAND STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION, FAST PROCESSES OCCURRING NEAR THE PEATLAND SURFACE, AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PEAT ACCUMULATION AND HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. AS A RESULT, THESE MODELS ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE EFFECTS OF BOG GROWTH ON HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS OR PEAT-FORMING PROCESSES. WE INTRODUCE FIVE CONCEPTUAL MODELS OF PEATLAND DEVELOPMENT THAT DIFFER IN HOW BOG SIZE AND SHAPE CHANGE OVER TIME, AND WE EXAMINE THE CONSEQUENCES OF EACH MODEL FOR HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. THIS EXERCISE SHOWS HOW BOG HEIGHT GROWTH AND LATERAL EXPANSION CHANGE THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS CONSTRAINING PEATLAND DYNAMICS, AND SO DETERMINE THE DIRECTION OF ECOSYSTEM DEVELOPMENT. WE LINK PEATLAND PROPERTIES TO THE FOUR GENERAL PROPERTIES OF ''COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS'' (CAS): SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY, LOCALIZED FLOWS, SELF-ORGANIZING STRUCTURE AND NONLINEARITY. WE ALSO PRESENT A FRAMEWORK FOR MODELING PEATLANDS AS CAS. IN THIS FRAMEWORK, THE SYSTEM IS DISAGGREGATED, BOTH VERTICALLY AND HORIZONTALLY, INTO A SET OF COMPONENTS THAT INTERACT LOCALLY THROUGH FLOWS OF ENERGY AND RESOURCES. BOTH INTERNAL DYNAMICS AND EXTERNAL FORCING DRIVE CHANGES IN HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND MICROHABITAT PATTERN, AND THESE AUTOGENIC AND ALLOGENIC CHANGES IN PEATLAND STRUCTURE AFFECT HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES, WHICH, IN TURN, CONSTRAIN PEATLAND DEVELOPMENT AND CARBON CYCLING.

IN THIS SHORT REVIEW, WE PRESENT RECENT EVIDENCE THAT THIS VIEW IS INVALID. THE STABILITY OF DOM FROM FOREST FLOOR HORIZONS, PEATS, AND TOPSOILS AGAINST MICROBIAL DEGRADATION INCREASES WITH ADVANCED DECOMPOSITION OF THE PARENT ORGANIC MATTER (OM). AROMATIC COMPOUNDS, DERIVING FROM LIGNIN, LIKELY ARE THE MOST STABLE COMPONENTS OF DOM WHILE PLANT-DERIVED CARBOHYDRATES SEEM EASILY DEGRADABLE. CARBOHYDRATES AND N-RICH COMPOUNDS OF MICROBIAL ORIGIN PRODUCED DURING THE DEGRADATION OF DOM CAN BE RELATIVELY STABLE. SUCH COMPONENTS CONTRIBUTE MUCH TO DOM IN THE MINERAL SUBSOIL. SORPTION OF DOM TO SOIL MINERALS AND (CO-)PRECIPITATION WITH AL (AND PROBABLY ALSO WITH FE), ESPECIALLY OF THE INHERENTLY STABLE AROMATIC MOIETIES, RESULT IN DISTINCT STABILIZATION. IN LABORATORY INCUBATION EXPERIMENTS, THE MEAN RESIDENCE TIME OF DOM FROM THE OA HORIZON OF A HAPLIC PODZOL INCREASED FROM <30 Y IN SOLUTION TO >90 Y AFTER SORPTION TO A SUBSOIL. WE COMBINED DOM FLUXES AND MINERALIZATION RATE CONSTANTS FOR DOM SORBED TO MINERALS AND A SUBSOIL HORIZON, AND (CO-) PRECIPITATED WITH AL TO ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION OF DOM TO TOTAL C IN THE MINERAL SOIL OF A HAPLIC PODZOL IN GERMANY. THE CONTRIBUTION OF ROOTS TO DOM WAS NOT CONSIDERED BECAUSE OF LACK OF DATA. THE DOM-DERIVED SOIL C RANGES FROM 20 TO 55 MG HA(-1) IN THE MINERAL SOIL, WHICH REPRESENTS 19%-50% OF THE TOTAL SOIL C. THE VARIATION OF THE ESTIMATE REFLECTS THE VARIATION IN MINERALIZATION RATE CONSTANTS OBTAINED FOR SORBED AND (CO-) PRECIPITATED DOM. NEVERTHELESS, THE ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT DOM CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE ACCUMULATION OF STABLE OM IN SOIL. A MORE PRECISE ESTIMATION OF DOM-DERIVED C IN SOILS REQUIRES MINERALIZATION RATE CONSTANTS FOR DOM SORBED TO ALL RELEVANT MINERALS OR (CO-)PRECIPITATED WITH FE. ADDITIONALLY, WE NEED INFORMATION ON THE CONTRIBUTION OF SORPTION TO DISTINCT MINERALS AS WELL AS OF (CO-)PRECIPITATION WITH AL AND FE TO DOM RETENTION.","CONTRIBUTION OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER TO CARBON STORAGE IN FOREST MINERAL SOILS","JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE","REVIEW","FEB",2008,"10.1002/jpln.200700043","AGRONOMY; PLANT SCIENCES; SOIL SCIENCE","WOS:000253431000005"
"11","MOORE PD, 2002, ENVIRON CONSERV","MOORE PD","THE TEMPERATE PEATLANDS ARE EXTENSIVE, COVERING AROUND 3.5 MILLION KM(2) OF LAND. THEY CONTAIN ABOUT 455 GT OF CARBON, ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO THE CARBON STORED IN ALL OF THE LIVING THINGS ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET, AND REPRESENTING AROUND 25% OF ALL THE SOIL CARBON ON EARTH. THESE BOGS ARE A SINK FOR ATMOSPHERIC CARBON AND THEIR CARBON UPTAKE ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 12% OF CURRENT HUMAN EMISSIONS. THEY VARY CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR FORM AND STRUCTURE AND ARE AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, INCLUDING THE STUDY OF PAST ENVIRONMENTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THEY ARE ALSO VALUABLE IN ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION. THEY ARE LOW IN BIODIVERSITY, BUT THEIR FAUNA AND FLORA ARE DISTINCTIVE AND MANY GROUPS ARE CONFINED TO THIS HABITAT. FOR ALL THESE REASONS, THE FUTURE CONSERVATION OF PEATLANDS IS A MATTER FOR CONCERN. THREATS TO PEATLANDS COME FROM DIRECT HUMAN EXPLOITATION IN THE FORM OF PEAT HARVESTING FOR ENERGY AND HORTICULTURE, AND DRAINAGE FOR FORESTRY. RISING ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS SHOULD CONTROL BOTH OF THESE PROCESSES IN THE WESTERN WORLD, BUT CONTINUED NORTHERN PEATLAND LOSSES ARE LIKELY LOCALLY, ESPECIALLY IN ASIA. PEATLAND DRAINAGE FOR FORESTRY OR AGRICULTURE WILL RESULT IN LOSSES OF CARBON TO THE ATMOSPHERE, ADDING TO THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT. HUMAN POPULATION PRESSURES, INDUSTRIALIZATION AND URBANIZATION ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE INFLUENCE IN THE BOREAL ZONE. FRAGMENTATION OF THE HABITAT IS NOT AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION BECAUSE BOGS ARE BY THEIR VERY NATURE 'ISLAND' HABITATS. ACIDIFICATION BY AERIAL POLLUTION MAY BE A LOCAL PROBLEM CLOSE TO SOURCES, BUT THE HABITAT IS NATURALLY ACID AND SHOULD NOT BE SEVERELY AFFECTED, THE INPUT OF AERIAL NUTRIENTS, HOWEVER, PARTICULARLY NITROGEN, COULD HAVE WIDESPREAD IMPACT ON BOGS, ENHANCING THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND ALTERING THEIR VEGETATION COMPOSITION. THE PHYSICAL REHABILITATION OF BOGS DAMAGED BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES PRESENTS MANY PROBLEMS, PARTICULARLY RELATING TO THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF PEAT STRUCTURE AND VEGETATION, BUT THE PROCESS CAN RESULT IN THE RE-FORMATION OF A CARBON SINK SO IT IS WORTH THE EFFORT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN ITS IMPACT ON BOGS. HIGHER TEMPERATURE (ESPECIALLY IF ACCOMPANIED BY RAISED ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS AND INCREASED NITRATE DEPOSITION) WILL ENHANCE PRODUCTIVITY, BUT WILL ALSO RESULT IN FASTER DECOMPOSITION RATES. THE OUTCOME OF THESE OPPOSING FACTORS FOR PEAT FORMATION WILL ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON THE FUTURE PATTERN OF PRECIPITATION. IF, AS SEEMS MOST LIKELY, SUMMER CONDITIONS BECOME WARMER AND DRIER IN CONTINENTAL REGIONS AND WINTERS BECOME MILDER AND WETTER, THE SUMMER DROUGHT COULD CAUSE PEAT LOSS AND BOG CONTRACTION. AN EXCESS OF DECOMPOSITION WILL LEAD TO BOGS BECOMING A CARBON SOURCE AND THUS A POSITIVE FEEDBACK IN GLOBAL WARMING. EMISSIONS OF METHANE AND NITROUS OXIDE WOULD ADD TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS PROBLEM, BUT LIKELY OXIDATION OF METHANE AND LOW N(2)O PRODUCTION MAY WELL MEAN THAT THIS IMPACT WILL NOT PROVE TO BE SIGNIFICANT. TREE INVASION OF BOGS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUMMER DROUGHT COULD LOCALLY LEAD TO INCREASED WATER LOSS THROUGH TRANSPIRATION, AND HIGHER HEAT ABSORPTION THROUGH ALBEDO CHANGE. THIS WILL ENHANCE THE DRYING EFFECT ON THE BOG SURFACE. OCEANIC MIRES WILL BE LESS SEVERELY AFFECTED IF THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN PRECIPITATION TAKES PLACE IN THESE REGIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT OVERALL FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE FUTURE OF THE NORTHERN BOGS IS LIKELY TO BE THE QUANTITY AND PATTERN (BOTH SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY) OF FUTURE PRECIPITATION IN THE ZONE.","THE FUTURE OF COOL TEMPERATE BOGS","ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION","REVIEW","MAR",2002,"10.1017/S0376892902000024","BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000175924000002"

IN ORDER TO FULLY ASSESS THE ROLE OF PEATLANDS ON GLOBAL C BALANCE, NOW AND IN THE FUTURE, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE DEEPEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF VARIOUS GROUPS OF MICROORGANISMS TO ORGANIC MATTER TRANSFORMATIONS.

THIS IS MAINLY ACCOMPLISHED BY THE RAPID ACCUMULATION OF LACUSTRINE SEDIMENTS AND A VERY HIGH PRESERVATION FACTOR (ON AVERAGE 50 TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT IN THE OCEANS). LAKES WITH RELATIVELY LARGE DRAINAGE AREAS COMMONLY DISPLAY THE HIGHEST CARBON ACCUMULATION RATES. IN MOST CASES, BURIAL OF ORGANIC MATTER IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT OF CARBONATE CARBON PRODUCED BY SILICATE WEATHERING, IN CONTRAST TO THE OCEANS WHERE THE BURIAL OF ATMOSPHERIC CARBONATE CARBON ALMOST REACHES THE SAME AMOUNT AS THAT OF ORGANIC CARBON. EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE ARE CLOSED LAKE BASINS IN ARID TO SEMIARID CLIMATE WHICH PRECIPITATE A MAJOR PART OF THEIR ATMOSPHERE-DERIVED DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON (DIC) AS CARBONATE. THESE RESULTS ARE DEMONSTRATED IN SOME DETAIL FOR L. QINGHAI, CHINA, (LOW CONTRIBUTION OF ATMOSPHERIC CARBONATE CARBON) AND L. TURKANA, EAST AFRICA, (HIGH CONTRIBUTION FROM SILICATE ROCKS). FURTHER DATA ARE GAINED BY ESTIMATES FOR A NUMBER OF CLOSED AND OPEN LAKES. THE DRAINAGE AREAS OF THE LAKES WITHDRAW ATMOSPHERIC CARBON AT RATES OF MOSTLY 1-4 G/M(2)/A, CALCULATED FROM THE LACUSTRINE CARBON BURIAL. CARBON BURIAL RATES IN LAKES COMMONLY INCREASE WITH CHANGE TO WETTER AND WARMER CLIMATE (PARTIALLY LARGER LAKE SURFACES, HIGHER RATES OF SEASONAL CARBONATE PRECIPITATION, TREND TO STRATIFIED LAKE WATERS WITH OXYGEN-DEFICIENT BOTTOM WATER). ANTHROPOGENIC INFLUENCE MOSTLY ENHANCES THE PRODUCTION AND PRESERVATION OF ORGANIC CARBON IN LAKE BASINS (OFTEN BY A FACTOR OF 3-4). AFTER THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM, THE JOINT ACTION OF THE GLOBALLY SPREADING VEGETATION, PEAT GROWTH, AND CARBON BURIAL IN LAKES WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE THE ATMOSPHERIC CARBON POOL TO ONE THIRD TO ONE HALF OF ITS PRESENT AMOUNT WITHIN A TIME PERIOD OF 1 KA. HOWEVER, CO2 EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE OCEAN HAS BROUGHT ABOUT AN OVERALL INCREASE IN THE ATMOSPHERIC CO2 DURING THE HOLOCENE.

LOCATION: EUROPEAN AND NORTH AMERICAN FENS. METHODS: THIS PAPER IS A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON THE EFFECTS OF GRAZING, FIRE AND CUTTING ON FENS, TO EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MANAGEMENT AND BIODIVERSITY IN FENS. RESULTS: A REDUCTION OF CATTLE GRAZING, MOWING AND BURNING IN FENS HAS LED TO A REDUCTION IN BIODIVERSITY IN FENS. THE VEGETATION OF ABANDONED FENS SHIFTS TO TREES AND SHRUBS AFTER 10-15 YEARS, WHICH SHADE THE SMALLER AND RARER SPECIES OF THESE WETLANDS. WHILE CAREFUL USE OF FIRE IS USED TO MANAGE FENS IN NORTH AMERICA, IT IS NOT WIDELY USED IN EUROPEAN FENS, PERHAPS BECAUSE THE PEAT OF DRAINED FENS MAY CATCH FIRE. CATTLE GRAZING CANNOT BE CONSIDERED A NATURAL DISTURBANCE IN NORTH AMERICA, SINCE CATTLE DID NOT EVOLVE ON THAT CONTINENT. IN EUROPE, CATTLE DO NOT GENERALLY GRAZE IN UNALTERED FENS, BUT THEY DO USE SLIGHTLY DRAINED FEN MEADOWS. CONCLUSIONS: THREE APPROACHES HAVE BEEN USED TO CONTROL THE DOMINANCE OF TALL WOODY AND HERBACEOUS SPECIES IN ABANDONED FENS, INCLUDING THE RE-INTRODUCTION OF CATTLE, MOWING, AND BURNING. OVERGRAZING RESULTS IN A PERMANENT REDUCTION IN BIODIVERSITY, THEREFORE CATTLE RE-INTRODUCTION MUST BE APPROACHED CAUTIOUSLY. IN EUROPE, BUT NOT IN NORTH AMERICA, MOWING HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT TOOL, AND MOWING HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN MAINTAINING SPECIES RICHNESS, PARTICULARLY IN FENS THAT HAVE BEEN MOWED ANNUALLY FOR CENTURIES. FIRE HAS BEEN THE MOST COMMON AND SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT TOOL IN NORTH AMERICA ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT EFFECTIVE IN REMOVING SHRUBS THAT HAVE BECOME LARGE. BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS ARE SIMILAR, THE LITERATURE OF BOTH EUROPEAN AND NORTH AMERICAN FEN MANAGEMENT CAN BE ANALYZED TO BETTER ASSESS THE MANAGEMENT OF FENS ON BOTH CONTINENTS.

HOWEVER, RESEARCH ON THE IMPACTS OF OIL PALM CULTIVATION IS SCATTERED AND PATCHY, AND NO CLEAR OVERVIEW EXISTS. WE ADDRESS THIS GAP THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC AND COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW OF ALL ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS IN OIL PALM PLANTATIONS, INCLUDING SEVERAL (GENETIC, MEDICINAL AND ORNAMENTAL RESOURCES, INFORMATION FUNCTIONS) NOT INCLUDED IN PREVIOUS SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. WE COMPARE ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS IN OIL PALM PLANTATIONS TO THOSE IN FORESTS, AS THE CONVERSION OF FOREST TO OIL PALM IS PREVALENT IN THE TROPICS. WE FIND THAT OIL PALM PLANTATIONS GENERALLY HAVE REDUCED ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING COMPARED TO FORESTS: 11 OUT OF 14 ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS SHOW A NET DECREASE IN LEVEL OF FUNCTION. SOME FUNCTIONS SHOW DECREASES WITH POTENTIALLY IRREVERSIBLE GLOBAL IMPACTS (E.G. REDUCTIONS IN GAS AND CLIMATE REGULATION, HABITAT AND NURSERY FUNCTIONS, GENETIC RESOURCES, MEDICINAL RESOURCES, AND INFORMATION FUNCTIONS). THE MOST SERIOUS IMPACTS OCCUR WHEN FOREST IS CLEARED TO ESTABLISH NEW PLANTATIONS, AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS, ESPECIALLY ON PEAT SOILS. TO VARIABLE DEGREES, SPECIFIC PLANTATION MANAGEMENT MEASURES CAN PREVENT OR REDUCE LOSSES OF SOME ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS (E.G. AVOID ILLEGAL LAND CLEARING VIA FIRE, AVOID DRAINING OF PEAT, USE OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT, USE OF COVER CROPS, MULCH, AND COMPOST) AND WE HIGHLIGHT SYNERGISTIC MITIGATION MEASURES THAT CAN IMPROVE MULTIPLE ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY.

THE MAIN TOPICS ARE PRESENTED WITHIN THE STANDARD FRAMEWORK OF THE BIOLOGICAL FLORA OF THE BRITISH ISLES: DISTRIBUTION, HABITAT, COMMUNITIES, RESPONSES TO BIOTIC FACTORS, RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENT, STRUCTURE AND PHYSIOLOGY, PHENOLOGY, FLORAL AND SEED CHARACTERS, HERBIVORES AND DISEASE, HISTORY AND CONSERVATION. 2. JUNIPERUS COMMUNIS (JUNIPER) IS AN EVERGREEN DIOECIOUS GYMNOSPERM SHRUB WITH TWO MAIN POPULATION CENTRES IN BRITAIN, ONE ON CHALK DOWNLANDS OF SOUTHERN ENGLAND AND THE OTHER IN NORTHERN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND. BRITISH POPULATIONS ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO MAIN SUBSPECIES ALTHOUGH THERE IS OVERLAP IN GENETIC AND MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES. SUBSPECIES COMMUNIS VARIES FROM A SPREADING SHRUB TO AN ERECT TREE CHARACTERISTIC OF CALCAREOUS SOILS IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND, VARIOUS SOILS IN THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS, WHILE SSP. NANA IS A SMALL PROCUMBENT SHRUB, RESTRICTED TO WELL-DRAINED BOGS AND, MORE USUALLY, ROCKY OUTCROPS, GENERALLY AS A MINOR COMPONENT OF UPLAND HEATHS AND MONTANE SCRUB. BOTH SUBSPECIES ARE DROUGHT AND FROST TOLERANT, ALTHOUGH SENSITIVE TO FIRE. A THIRD SUBSPECIES, HEMISPHAERICA, PRIMARILY FOUND IN MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHERN EUROPE HAS TWO SMALL POPULATIONS ON MARITIME CLIFFS IN THE UK. 3. ALTHOUGH NOT VERY PALATABLE, J. COMMUNIS IS GRAZED BY SMALL AND LARGE MAMMALS WHEN FOOD IS SHORT, PARTICULARLY IN WINTER. ITS LOW PALATABILITY IS DERIVED FROM OILS FOUND IN THE NEEDLES, CONES AND WOOD, DOMINATED BY MONOTERPENES. THESE HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY USED IN FOLKLORE MEDICINE AND TO FLAVOUR ALCOHOLIC DRINKS, AND ARE BEING INVESTIGATED FOR NEW MEDICINAL USES. 4. JUNIPERUS COMMUNIS SSP.

ALTHOUGH SUSCEPTIBLE TO OVERGRAZING, SOME GRAZING CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO CREATE THE OPEN SWARD NECESSARY FOR SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENT.

IN YEARS 5 AND 6, CONCENTRATIONS, FLUXES, AND ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS OF METHANE WERE MEASURED ALONG WITH ABOVEGROUND AND BELOWGROUND NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY AND PORE WATER CONCENTRATIONS OF ACETATE, SULFATE, AMMONIUM, NITRATE, AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON. WATER TABLE LEVEL WAS THE DOMINANT CONTROL OVER METHANE FLUX IN THE FEN MESOCOSMS, LIKELY THROUGH ITS EFFECT ON METHANE OXIDATION RATES. HOWEVER, PORE WATER CHEMISTRY AND PLANT PRODUCTIVITY WERE IMPORTANT SECONDARY FACTORS IN EXPLAINING METHANE FLUX IN THE FEN MESOCOSMS, AND THESE FACTORS APPEARED TO BE THE PREDOMINANT CONTROLS OVER METHANE FLUX IN THE BOG MESOCOSMS. THE WATER TABLE AND IR TREATMENTS HAD LARGE EFFECTS ON PORE WATER CHEMISTRY AND PLANT PRODUCTIVITY, SO THE INDIRECT EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE APPEAR TO BE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF CHANGING TEMPERATURE AND WATER TABLE LEVEL IN CONTROLLING FUTURE METHANE FLUXES FROM NORTHERN PEATLANDS. PORE WATER SULFATE, AMMONIUM, NITRATE, AND ACETATE HAD A RELATIVELY CONSISTENT NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH METHANE EMISSIONS, PORE WATER DOC HAD A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH METHANE EMISSIONS, AND BNPP HAD MIXED EFFECTS. THE BOG MESOCOSMS HAD MUCH HIGHER METHANE EMISSIONS AND PORE WATER METHANE CONCENTRATIONS THAN THE FEN MESOCOSMS, DESPITE A MUCH LOWER AVERAGE WATER TABLE LEVEL AND PEAT THAT IS A POOR SUBSTRATE FOR METHANOGENESIS. WE SUGGEST THAT THE RELATIVELY HIGH METHANE FLUXES IN THE BOG MESOCOSMS CAN BE EXPLAINED THROUGH THEIR LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF INHIBITORY PORE WATER COMPOUNDS, HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF DOC, AND HIGH PLANT PRODUCTIVITY. STABLE ISOTOPIC DATA FROM PORE WATER SUPPORT ACETATE FERMENTATION AS THE PRINCIPAL PATHWAY OF METHANOGENESIS IN BOG MESOCOSMS (MEAN DELTA(13) CH4 = -41.0%, MEAN DELTA D-CH4 = -190%). FEN MESOCOSMS HAD LOWER PORE WATER CONCENTRATIONS AND EMISSIONS OF METHANE THAN BOG MESOCOSMS, DESPITE MUCH HIGHER METHANE PRODUCTION POTENTIALS IN FEN PEAT. THE METHANE FROM THE FEN MESOCOSMS WAS ISOTOPICALLY HEAVY (MEAN DELTA(CH4)-C-13 = -28.9%, MEAN DELTA D-CH4 = -140%), SUGGESTING A STRONG OXIDATIVE SINK. THIS IS LIKELY RELATED TO THE DOMINANCE OF GRAMINOID VEGETATION AND THE ASSOCIATED OXYGEN TRANSPORT INTO THE RHIZOSPHERE. OUR RESULTS ILLUSTRATE THE NEED FOR A MORE ROBUST UNDERSTANDING OF THE MULTIPLE FEEDBACKS BETWEEN CLIMATE FORCING AND PLANT AND MICROBIAL FEEDBACKS IN THE RESPONSE OF NORTHERN PEATLANDS TO CLIMATE CHANGE.","EFFECTS OF SOIL WARMING AND DRYING ON METHANE CYCLING IN A NORTHERN PEATLAND MESOCOSM STUDY","JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES","REVIEW","JUL 26",2008,"10.1029/2007JG000609","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000257999100001"

THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO ISOLATE THE EFFECT OF FOREST STAND AGE ON SOIL EDAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS (TEMPERATURE, WATER TABLE AND VOLUMETRIC MOISTURE) AND THE CONSEQUENT INFLUENCE OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS ON THE GHG FLUXES. FLUXES WERE MEASURED IN A CHRONOSEQUENCE IN HARWOOD, ENGLAND, WITH SITES COMPRISING 30- AND 20-YEAR-OLD SECOND ROTATION FOREST AND A SITE CLEARFELLED (CF) SOME 18 MONTHS BEFORE MEASUREMENT. ADJOINING UNFORESTED GRASSLAND (UN) ACTED AS A CONTROL. COMPARISONS WERE MADE BETWEEN FLUX DATA, SOIL TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE DATA AND, AT THE 30-YEAR-OLD AND CF SITES, EDDY COVARIANCE DATA FOR NET ECOSYSTEM CARBON (C) EXCHANGE (NEE). THE MAIN FINDINGS WERE: FIRSTLY, INTEGRATED CO2 EFFLUX WAS THE DOMINANT INFLUENCE ON THE GHG BUDGET, CONTRIBUTING 93-94% OF THE TOTAL GHG FLUX ACROSS THE CHRONOSEQUENCE COMPARED WITH 6-7% FROM CH4 AND N2O COMBINED. SECONDLY, THERE WERE CLEAR LINKS BETWEEN THE TRENDS IN EDAPHIC FACTORS AS THE FOREST MATURED, OR AFTER CLEARFELLING, AND THE EMISSION OF GHGS. IN THE CHRONOSEQUENCE SITES, ANNUAL FLUXES OF CO2 WERE LOWER AT THE 20-YEAR-OLD (20Y) SITE THAN AT THE 30-YEAR-OLD (30Y) AND CF SITES, WITH SOIL TEMPERATURE THE DOMINANT CONTROL. CH4 EFFLUX WAS HIGHEST AT THE CF SITE, WITH PEAK FLUX 491 +/- 54.5 MU G M(-2) H(-1) AND MAXIMUM ANNUAL FLUX 18.0 +/- 1.1 KG CH4 HA(-1) YR(-1). NO CONSISTENT UPTAKE OF CH4 WAS NOTED AT ANY SITE.

RELEVANT RESEARCH HAS TAKEN PLACE AT THREE SCALES: LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS ON PEAT CORES, PLOT SCALE SAMPLING OF SOIL WATERS AND CATCHMENT SCALE SAMPLING OF STREAM WATERS. WHILE LABORATORY STUDIES SUGGEST BURNING INCREASES COLOUR PRODUCTION, THE EVIDENCE FROM CATCHMENT AND PLOT STUDIES IS CONTRADICTORY. PLOT STUDIES SUGGEST COLOUR PRODUCTION MAY DECREASE OR REMAIN UNCHANGED FOLLOWING BURNING ALTHOUGH THERE IS EVIDENCE FOR SOME TRANSIENT CHANGES.

THE DIFFERENCES IN FINDINGS BETWEEN PLOT AND CATCHMENT STUDIES MAY BE EXPLAINED BY: I) THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF SOME STUDIES WHICH DO NOT MEASURE LONG-TERM RESPONSE AND RECOVERY TIMES TO BURNING; II) THE LACK OF COLOUR MEASUREMENTS FROM SHALLOW SOIL DEPTHS WHICH CONTRIBUTE MORE TO STREAMFLOW THAN SOIL WATER FROM DEEPER IN THE PEAT; AND III) THE POSSIBILITY OF HYDROLOGICAL INTERACTIONS OCCURRING BETWEEN DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTAL PLOTS AT SOME SITES.

BOTH ARE SENSITIVE ISSUES BECAUSE, ON THE ONE HAND, THE DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH CORRECTLY DETERMINING ORGANIC CARBON CONCENTRATIONS IN SURFACE WATERS ARE WELL KNOWN, WHILE, ON THE OTHER, DEALING WITH REAL ENVIRONMENTAL DATA (I.E., LACK OF NORMALITY, CENSORING, MISSING VALUES, ETC.) IS AN EXTREMELY INTRICATE MATTER. OTHER ISSUES SUCH AS DATA REPORTING AND THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF THE SYSTEMS STUDIED ARE ALSO DISCUSSED. IN CONCLUSION, IT IS CLEAR THAT ORGANIC CARBON CONCENTRATIONS HAVE INCREASED IN SOME SURFACE WATERS IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE SINCE THE 1990S. HOWEVER, DUE TO A LACK OF DATA IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD, IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THIS PHENOMENON IS GENERAL AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, IN THE AREAS FOR WHICH SUCH DATA DO EXIST, THE REPORTING AND METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN THE PUBLISHED STUDIES PREVENT ANY CONCLUSION ON THE EXISTENCE OF A GENERAL TEMPORAL BEHAVIOR OF ORGANIC CARBON FROM BEING DRAWN.","LONG-TERM TRENDS OF ORGANIC CARBON CONCENTRATIONS IN FRESHWATERS: STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF EXISTING EVIDENCE","WATER","REVIEW","MAY",2014,"10.3390/w6051360","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; WATER RESOURCES","WOS:000337113600015"

A RECENT MANAGEMENT TREND FOR DRAINED PEATLANDS IS THE CONTROL OF GREENHOUSE GASES (GHG) BY CHANGES IN AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES, PEATLAND RESTORATION OR PALUDICULTURE. DUE TO COMPLEX ANTAGONISTIC CONTROLS OF MOISTURE, WATER TABLE MANAGEMENT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO USE AS A METHOD FOR CONTROLLING GHG EMISSIONS. PAST STUDIES SHOW THAT THERE IS NO OBVIOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GHG EMISSION RATES AND CROP TYPE, TILLAGE INTENSITY OR FERTILIZATION RATES. FOR DRAINED PEAT SOILS, THE BEST USE OPTIONS CAN VARY FROM REWETTING WITH REDUCED EMISSION TO EFFICIENT SHORT TERM USE TO MAXIMIZE THE, PROFIT PER AMOUNT OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMITTED. THE GHG ACCOUNTING SHOULD CONSIDER THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE OF THE PEATLAND AND THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC BENEFITS PEATLANDS PROVIDE LOCALLY. CULTIVATING ENERGY CROPS IS A VIABLE OPTION ESPECIALLY FOR WET PEAT SOILS WITH POOR DRAINAGE, BUT HARVESTING REMAINS A CHALLENGE DUE TO TRACTABILITY OF WET SOILS. PALUDICULTURE IN LOWLAND FLOODPLAINS CAN BE A TOOL TO MITIGATE REGIONAL FLOODING ALLOWING WATER TO BE STORED ON THESE LANDS WITHOUT MUCH HARM TO CROPS. THIS CAN ALSO INCREASE REGIONAL BIODIVERSITY PROVIDING IMPORTANT HABITATS FOR BIRDS AND MOISTURE TOLERANT PLANT SPECIES. HOWEVER, ON MANY PEATLANDS REWETTING IS NOT POSSIBLE DUE TO THEIR POSITION IN THE LANDSCAPE AND THE ASSOCIATED DIFFICULTY TO MAINTAIN A HIGH STABLE WATER TABLE. WHILE THE GOAL OF REWETTING OFTEN IS TO ENCOURAGE THE RETURN OF PEAT FORMING PLANTS AND THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THEY PROVIDE SUCH AS CARBON SEQUESTRATION, IT IS NOT WELL KNOWN IF THESE PLANTS WILL GROW ON PEAT SOILS THAT HAVE BEEN ALTERED BY THE PROCESS OF DRAINAGE AND MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER PEAT QUALITY AND HYDROLOGY WHEN CHOOSING MANAGEMENT OPTIONS. MAPPING OF SITES IS RECOMMENDED AS A MANAGEMENT TOOL TO GUIDE ACTIONS. THE ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THE SITES SHOULD BE ASSESSED BOTH FOR CONTINUED CULTIVATION BUT ALSO FOR OTHER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES SUCH AS RESTORATION AND HYDROLOGICAL FUNCTIONS (FLOOD CONTROL). FARMERS NEED ADVICE, TOOLS AND TRAINING TO FIND THE BEST AFTER-USE OPTION. BIOFUELS MIGHT PROVIDE A COST-EFFICIENT AFTER USE OPTION FOR SOME SITES. PEAT EXTRACTION FOLLOWED BY REWETTING MIGHT PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE OPTION AS REWETTING IS OFTEN EASIER IF THE PEAT IS REMOVED, STARTING THE PEAT ACCUMULATION FROM SCRATCH. ALSO THIS PROVIDES A WAY TO FINANCE THE AFTER-USE. AS IMPACTS OF LAND USE ARE UNCERTAIN, NEW POLICIES SHOULD CONSIDER MULTIPLE BENEFITS AND DECISIONS SHOULD BE BASED ON SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND FIELD SCALE OBSERVATIONS. THE NEED TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND THE KEY PROCESSES AND LONG TERM EFFECTS OF FIELD SCALE LAND USE MANIPULATIONS IS EVIDENT.

THIS LEADS TO HIGH RESIDUAL NAPL SATURATION IN PORE SPACES.

THE PLANTS EXHIBIT A MARKED PHYSIOLOGICAL POLARITY ALONG THEIR LINEAR SHOOTS WITH RAPID APICAL SHOOT GROWTH. THEIR VERY HIGH RELATIVE GROWTH RATE IS IN HARMONY WITH THE RECORD-HIGH NET PHOTOSYNTHETIC RATE OF THEIR PHOTOSYNTHETIC SHOOTS. FLOWERING OF THESE SPECIES IS COMMON UNDER FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS AND IS STIMULATED BY HIGH TEMPERATURES BUT ONLY U. INTERMEDIA SETS SEEDS; THE OTHER SPECIES ARE STERILE DUE TO POLLEN MALFORMATION.

ALTHOUGH OXYGEN CONCENTRATIONS INSIDE RESET TRAPS ARE (ALMOST) ZERO, TRAPS ARE INHABITED BY MANY MICROSCOPIC ORGANISMS (BACTERIA, EUGLENS, ALGAE, CILIATES, ROTIFERS, FUNGI).

WET SOILS, COVER AN AREA GREATER THAN 12.1 MILLION KM(2); INLAND WETLANDS DELIVER AT LEAST INT$27.0 TRILLION IN TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE BENEFITS. HOWEVER, DUE TO THEIR INTIMATE ASSOCIATION WITH WET ENVIRONMENTS, WET SOILS ARE AT RISK OF DEGRADATION DURING DROUGHT EVENTS. THIS REVIEW INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF DROUGHT ON WET SOILS, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE CHANGES IN SOIL GEOCHEMISTRY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. IT IS CLEAR FROM THIS REVIEW THAT DROUGHT POSES A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO WET SOILS, A THREAT WHICH CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE BEFORE AN EVENT BUT WHICH POSES A CATASTROPHIC RISK TO SOME SITES. DROUGHT CAUSES OXYGEN PENETRATION TO INCREASE IN WET SOILS, LEADING TO AN INCREASE IN OXIDATION OF ORGANIC MATTER AND REDUCED INORGANIC SPECIES (E.G. SULFIDES). OXIDATION OF THESE MATERIALS CAN LEAD TO SOIL ACIDIFICATION, METAL MOBILIZATION AND TO NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON WATER QUALITY. INCREASED OXYGEN IN THE SOIL PROFILE ALSO AFFECTS BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLING, WITH INCREASED PRODUCTION OF NITROUS OXIDE AND DECREASED PRODUCTION OF METHANE. EFFECTS OF DROUGHT DIFFER BETWEEN PEAT AND MINERAL SOIL TYPES AND SUBTYPES. WET SOILS UNDERGO MAJOR CHRONOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATIONS AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL CHANGES IN THE ALTERATION OF ENVIRONMENTS OCCURRING BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER DROUGHT CONDITIONS. WATER CONDITIONS (I.E. SUBAQUEOUS, SATURATED, UNSATURATED AND RESATURATED) ALSO PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN CHRONOLOGICAL SOIL TRANSFORMATIONS. SOILS MAY NOT EASILY RECOVER BETWEEN SEVERE DROUGHTS AND INSTEAD ENTER ALTERNATIVE STABLE STATES. THIS REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS SUBSTANTIAL GAPS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTS OF DROUGHT ON WET SOILS AND SHOWS THAT PREVIOUS STUDIES OVERREPRESENT RELATIVELY SMALL GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS.","DROUGHT EFFECTS ON WET SOILS IN INLAND WETLANDS AND PEATLANDS","EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS","REVIEW","NOV",2020,"10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103387","GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000588283400036"

THE COMPOSITIONAL TRENDS OF THE UNDERSTOREY VEGETATION WERE ANALYSED BY MEANS OF HYBRID MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING (HMDS). IN ADDITION TO FIELD CLASSIFICATION, TWO-WAY INDICATOR SPECIES ANALYSIS (TWINSPAN) AND FLEXIBLE UNWEIGHTED PAIRED GROUP ARITHMETIC AVERAGE (FUPGMA) CLASSIFICATIONS WERE USED. THE 1ST HMDS DIMENSION PRIMARILY REFLECTED VARIATION ALONG A GRADIENT FROM SPRUCE MIRE INFLUENCE TO HUMMOCK-LEVEL BOG INFLUENCE. VARIATION IN NUTRIENT STATUS WAS ALSO CONNECTED TO THIS GRADIENT. FACTORS UNDERLYING THE 2ND DIMENSION WERE VARIATION IN NUTRIENT STATUS AND DRAINAGE SUCCESSION (MOISTURE). SOME SAMPLE PLOTS REPRESENTING HERB-RICH OR MOLINIA-RICH TYPES WERE SEPARATED ALONG THE 3RD DIMENSION. THE VARIATION IN UNDERSTOREY VEGETATION (I.E. THE ORDINATION SPACE) SHOWED HIGH MAXIMUM CORRELATION WITH STAND VOLUME R = 0.81, MEAN ANNUAL STAND VOLUME INCREMENT R = 0.76, AND POST-DRAINAGE DOMINANT HEIGHT R = 0.75. THE COVARIATION BETWEEN THE VEGETATION AND PEAT BULK DENSITY IN BOTH THE 0-10 AND 10-20 CM PEAT LAYERS WAS ALSO STRONG: R = 0.55 AND R = 0.80. THE CORRELATIONS FOR H-VPOST WERE 0.64 AND 0.81, RESPECTIVELY. OF THE TOTAL MACRONUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS, PHOSPHORUS (R = 0.73, R = 0.75) AND NITROGEN (R = 0.59, R = 0.64) WERE THE MOST STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH SPECIES COMPOSITION. THE ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLE VARIABLES WERE ALSO PRESENTED BY THE VEGETATION UNITS OF NUMERICAL CLASSIFICATION. MOST OF THE RECORDED VARIABLES, INCLUDING NUTRIENT AMOUNTS (KG HA(-1)), WERE EXAMINED IN SITE QUALITY (FERTILITY) CLASSES BY SUCCESSION PHASES AS WELL. BORDER VARIANTS OR TRANSITIONAL FORMS OF THE SITE TYPES WERE COMMON. ADDITIONAL VEGETATION CRITERIA (E.G. SURFACE-WATER INFLUENCE) MORE CLOSELY DEFINED THE ECOLOGY OF THE SITE. IN ADDITION TO THE SITE QUALITY CLASSES, A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE TREE STANDS, VEGETATION DIVERSITY AND PEAT PROPERTIES WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEPARATION OF THE SUCCESSION PHASES, I.E. IN THIS STUDY TRANSFORMING (PHASE II) VS. TRANSFORMED (FINAL PHASE III) SITES. IN CONCLUSION, THE ACTUAL VEGETATION APPEARED TO WELL REFLECT VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, EVEN IN LABILE COMMUNITIES OF COMMERCIAL FORESTS ON DRAINED PEATLANDS.","MULTIDIMENSIONAL SITE DESCRIPTION OF PEATLANDS DRAINED FOR FORESTRY","SILVA FENNICA","REVIEW",NA,2003,"10.14214/sf.512","FORESTRY","WOS:000181569200005"

THIS PAPER DEMONSTRATES THE POSSIBILITY OF QUANTIFYING SUB-CATCHMENT NUTRIENT BUDGETS FROM ROUTINELY MONITORED HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL DATA. THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ANTHROPOGENIC NUTRIENT SOURCES WAS QUANTIFIED FOR A SMALL CATCHMENT IN SCOTLAND. WITHIN THE CATCHMENT THERE ARE TWO SITES OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST, INCLUDING TWO LOCHS AND A FLOODPLAIN MIRE. THE STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR PRESCRIBING STRATEGIES TO SAFEGUARD THE CONSERVATION INTERESTS OF THESE AQUATIC SYSTEMS. 2. THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF NITRATE WAS FOUND TO BE GROUNDWATER. PHOSPHATE AND AMMONIUM LOADINGS WERE GREATEST IN SURFACE RUN-OFF. THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE GREATEST CONTRIBUTOR TOWARDS THESE NUTRIENT SOURCES IS AGRICULTURE. EVEN WHEN CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES OF LOSSES WERE APPLIED, CURRENT FERTILIZER AND ANIMAL INPUTS COULD ACCOUNT FOR PRESENT DAY NUTRIENT LOADINGS. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN THE AREA UNDER ARABLE FARMING AND UNDER INDIVIDUAL CROPS DURING THE PAST 30 YEARS ARE CONSISTENT WITH TRENDS IN NITRATE AND PHOSPHATE LOADS. 3. NUTRIENT INPUTS FROM SEWAGE WORKS OVERFLOWS AND SEPTIC TANKS WITHIN THE CATCHMENT WERE ESTIMATED TO BE SMALL. LEACHATE FROM A LANDFILL SITE WITHIN THE CATCHMENT WAS ALSO NOT CONSIDERED TO BE A MAJOR SOURCE OF NUTRIENTS, BUT A MORE INTENSIVE WATER QUALITY MONITORING PROGRAMME WOULD BE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THE ABSENCE OF LEACHATE PLUMES. 4. THE ONLY LONG-TERM SOLUTION TO REDUCING NUTRIENT LOADINGS TO THE AQUATIC SYSTEMS IS A REDUCTION IN AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE CATCHMENT AND AVOIDANCE OF FERTILIZER AND SLURRY APPLICATIONS NEAR WATER SOURCES. DIVERSION OF DRAINAGE DITCH WATERS SUPPLYING THE FLOODPLAIN MIRE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY BUT THE HYDROLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH AN ACTION COULD INDUCE MORE SEVERE DEGRADATION THAN THAT DUE TO NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT.","QUANTIFYING ANTHROPOGENIC NUTRIENT SOURCES AND LOADINGS WITHIN A SMALL CATCHMENT WITH CONSERVATION INTERESTS, EASTERN SCOTLAND","AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS","REVIEW","SEP",1994,"10.1002/aqc.3270040307","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; MARINE & FRESHWATER BIOLOGY; WATER RESOURCES","WOS:A1994PJ66300006"

THE PRESENT PAPER COLLATES AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON SCOTTISH SOIL C STOCKS AND C LOSSES AND REVIEWS THE POTENTIAL PRESSURES ON TERRESTRIAL C, WHICH MAY THREATEN FUTURE C STOCKS. PAST, PRESENT AND POSSIBLE FUTURE LAND USE, LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND LAND USE CHANGES (LUCS) INCLUDING FORESTRY, AGRICULTURE, NITROGEN (N) ADDITIONS, ELEVATED CO2 AND CLIMATE CHANGE FOR SCOTLAND ARE DISCUSSED AND EVALUATED IN RELATION TO THE ANTHROPOGENIC PRESSURES ON SOIL C. THE REVIEW DEDUCES THAT CURRENT AVAILABLE DATA SHOW LITTLE SUGGESTION OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN C STOCKS OF SCOTTISH SOILS, ALTHOUGH THIS MAY BE DUE TO A LACK OF LONG-TERM TREND DATA. HOWEVER, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THERE ARE MANY PRESSURES, SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE, INTENSITY OF LAND USE PRACTICES, SCALE OF LUC, SOIL EROSION AND POLLUTION, WHICH MAY POSE SIGNIFICANT THREATS TO THE FUTURE OF SCOTTISH SOIL C IF THESE FACTORS ARE NOT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN FUTURE LAND MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. IN PARTICULAR, THIS IS DUE TO THE LAND AREA COVERED BY VULNERABLE PEATS AND HIGHLY ORGANIC SOILS IN SCOTLAND COMPARED WITH OTHER AREAS IN THE UK. IT IS THEREFORE IMPERATIVE THAT SOIL C STOCKS FOR DIFFERENT LAND USE, MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND LUCS ARE MONITORED IN MORE DETAIL TO PROVIDE FURTHER INSIGHT INTO THE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN SEQUESTERED C AND SUBSEQUENT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, AS ADVISED BY THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE (UNFCCC).","ISSUES AND PRESSURES FACING THE FUTURE OF SOIL CARBON STOCKS WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON SCOTTISH SOILS","JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE","REVIEW","OCT",2014,"10.1017/S0021859613000300","AGRICULTURE, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000344016700001"

DURING THE 20TH CENTURY SUBSTANTIAL AREAS OF NORTHERN PEATLANDS WERE DRAINED TO REPURPOSE THE LAND FOR INDUSTRIAL OR AGRICULTURAL USE. DRAINED PEATLANDS HAVE DYSFUNCTIONAL MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES, WHICH CAN LEAD TO NET CARBON EMISSIONS. REWETTING OF DRAINED PEATLANDS IS THEREFORE AN ENVIRONMENTAL PRIORITY, YET OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTS OF PEATLAND DRAINAGE AND REWETTING ON MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES IS STILL INCOMPLETE. HERE WE SUMMARIZE THE LAST DECADE OF RESEARCH INTO THE RESPONSE OF THE WIDER MICROBIAL COMMUNITY, METHANE-CYCLING MICROORGANISMS, AND MICRO-FAUNA TO DRAINAGE AND REWETTING IN FENS AND BOGS IN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA. EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON CURRENT RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES AND THEIR LIMITATIONS. WE PROPOSE TARGETS FOR FUTURE WORK INCLUDING: ACCOUNTING FOR TIMESCALE OF DRAINAGE AND REWETTING EVENTS; BETTER VERTICAL AND LATERAL COVERAGE OF SAMPLES ACROSS A PEATLAND; THE INTEGRATION OF PROTEOMIC AND METABOLOMIC DATASETS INTO FUNCTIONAL COMMUNITY ANALYSIS; THE USE OF RNA SEQUENCING TO DIFFERENTIATE THE ACTIVE COMMUNITY FROM LEGACY DNA; AND FURTHER STUDY INTO THE RESPONSE OF THE VIRAL AND MICRO-FAUNAL COMMUNITIES TO PEATLAND DRAINAGE AND REWETTING.

HOWEVER, THE DRIVING MECHANISM BY WHICH SOIL LABILE CARBON AND NITROGEN AFFECT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM WETLAND ECOSYSTEMS UNDER GLOBAL NITROGEN INPUT IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. WORKING OUT THE DRIVING FACTOR OF NITROGEN INPUT ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS IS CRITICAL TO REDUCING GLOBAL WARMING FROM NITROGEN INPUT. THUS, WE SYNTHESIZED 72 PUBLISHED STUDIES (2144 PAIRED OBSERVATIONS) OF GREENHOUSE GAS FLUXES AND SOIL LABILE COMPOUNDS OF CARBON AND NITROGEN (AMMONIUM, NITRATE, DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON, SOIL MICROBIAL BIOMASS NITROGEN AND CARBON), TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF LABILE CARBON AND NITROGEN ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS UNDER GLOBAL NITROGEN INPUT. ACROSS THE DATA SET, NITROGEN INPUT SIGNIFICANTLY PROMOTED CARBON DIOXIDE, METHANE AND NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS. IN PARTICULAR, AT LOWER NITROGEN RATES (<100 KG HA(-1).YR(-1)) AND WITH ADDED AMMONIUM COMPOUNDS, FRESHWATER WETLAND SIGNIFICANTLY PROMOTED CARBON DIOXIDE AND METHANE EMISSIONS.

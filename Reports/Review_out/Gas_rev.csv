"KRUPA SV, 2003, ENVIRON POLLUT","KRUPA SV","AT THE GLOBAL SCALE, AMONG ALL N (NITROGEN) SPECIES IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND THEIR DEPOSITION ON TO TERRESTRIAL VEGETATION AND OTHER RECEPTORS, NH3 (AMMONIA) IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE FOREMOST. THE MAJOR SOURCES FOR ATMOSPHERIC NH3 ARE AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES AND ANIMAL FEEDLOT OPERATIONS, FOLLOWED BY BIOMASS BURNING (INCLUDING FOREST FIRES) AND TO A LESSER EXTENT FOSSIL FUEL COMBUSTION. CLOSE TO ITS SOURCES, ACUTE EXPOSURES TO NH3 CAN RESULT IN VISIBLE FOLIAR INJURY ON VEGETATION. NH3 IS DEPOSITED RAPIDLY WITHIN THE FIRST 4-5 KM FROM ITS SOURCE. HOWEVER, NH3 IS ALSO CONVERTED IN THE ATMOSPHERE TO FINE PARTICLE NH4+ (AMMONIUM) AEROSOLS THAT ARE A REGIONAL SCALE PROBLEM. MUCH OF OUR CURRENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE EFFECTS OF NH3 ON HIGHER PLANTS IS PREDOMINANTLY DERIVED FROM STUDIES CONDUCTED IN EUROPE. ADVERSE EFFECTS ON VEGETATION OCCUR WHEN THE RATE OF FOLIAR UPTAKE OF NH3 IS GREATER THAN THE RATE AND CAPACITY FOR IN VIVO DETOXIFICATION BY THE PLANTS. MOST TO LEAST SENSITIVE PLANT SPECIES TO NH3 ARE NATIVE VEGETATION > FORESTS > AGRICULTURAL CROPS. THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF STUDIES ON N DEPOSITION AND LICHENS, MOSSES AND GREEN ALGAE. DIRECT CAUSE AND EFFECT RELATIONSHIPS IN MOST OF THOSE CASES (EXCEPTIONS BEING THOSE LOCATIONS VERY CLOSE TO POINT SOURCES) ARE CONFOUNDED BY OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, PARTICULARLY CHANGES IN THE AMBIENT SO2 (SULFUR DIOXIDE) CONCENTRATIONS. IN ADDITION TO DIRECT FOLIAR INJURY, ADVERSE EFFECTS OF NH3 ON HIGHER PLANTS INCLUDE ALTERATIONS IN: GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY, TISSUE CONTENT OF NUTRIENTS AND TOXIC ELEMENTS, DROUGHT AND FROST TOLERANCE, RESPONSES TO INSECT PESTS AND DISEASE CAUSING MICROORGANISMS (PATHOGENS), DEVELOPMENT OF BENEFICIAL ROOT SYMBIOTIC OR MYCORRHIZAL ASSOCIATIONS AND INTER SPECIES COMPETITION OR BIODIVERSITY. IN ALL THESE CASES, THE JOINT EFFECTS OF NH3 WITH OTHER AIR POLLUTANTS SUCH AS ALL-PERVASIVE O-3 OR INCREASING CO2 CONCENTRATIONS ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. WHILE NH3 UPTAKE IN HIGHER PLANTS OCCURS THROUGH THE SHOOTS, NH4+ UPTAKE OCCURS THROUGH THE SHOOTS, ROOTS AND THROUGH BOTH PATHWAYS. HOWEVER, NH4+ IS IMMOBILE IN THE SOIL AND IS CONVERTED TO NO3- (NITRATE). IN AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS, ADDITIONS OF NO3- TO THE SOIL (INITIALLY AS NH3 OR NH4+) AND THE CONSEQUENT INCREASES IN THE EMISSIONS OF N2O (NITROUS OXIDE, A GREENHOUSE GAS) AND LEACHING OF NO3- INTO THE GROUND AND SURFACE WATERS ARE OF MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN. AT THE ECOSYSTEM LEVEL NH3 DEPOSITION CANNOT BE VIEWED ALONE, BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF TOTAL N DEPOSITION. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FOREST ECOSYSTEMS IN NORTH AMERICA THAT HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO N SATURATION AND THE CONSEQUENT NEGATIVE EFFECTS. THERE ARE ALSO HEATHLANDS AND OTHER PLANT COMMUNITIES IN EUROPE THAT HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO N-INDUCED ALTERATIONS. REGULATORY MITIGATIVE APPROACHES TO THESE PROBLEMS INCLUDE THE USE OF N SATURATION DATA OR THE CONCEPT OF CRITICAL LOADS. CURRENT INFORMATION SUGGESTS THAT A CRITICAL LOAD OF 5-10 KG HA(-1) YEAR(-1) OF TOTAL N DEPOSITION (BOTH DRY AND WET DEPOSITION COMBINED OF ALL ATMOSPHERIC N SPECIES) WOULD PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS (HEATHS, BOGS, CRYPTOGAMS) AND VALUES OF 10-20 KG HA(-1) YEAR(-1) WOULD PROTECT FORESTS, DEPENDING ON SOIL CONDITIONS.

THE RATE OF C SEQUESTRATION DECLINES AS A PEAT DEPOSIT GROWS, AND METHANE EMISSION INCREASES AS WET MICROHABITATS EXPAND IN AREA. WE EXAMINE THE THEORETICAL BASIS, UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR TWO HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL MODELS OF PEATLAND FORM AND DEVELOPMENT: CLYMO'S BOG GROWTH MODEL (BGM) AND INGRAM'S GROUNDWATER MOUND HYPOTHESIS (GMH). OUR DETAILED THEORETICAL ANALYSIS REVEALS PREVIOUSLY UNRECOGNIZED CONSEQUENCES OF THE MODELS AND, FOR THE BGM, UNREALISTICALLY STRINGENT CONDITIONS FOR APPLICATION. OUR REVIEW OF MODEL ASSUMPTIONS AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IDENTIFIES THE PRINCIPAL LIMITATIONS OF THESE MODELS: THEY IGNORE SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY IN PEATLAND STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION, FAST PROCESSES OCCURRING NEAR THE PEATLAND SURFACE, AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PEAT ACCUMULATION AND HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. AS A RESULT, THESE MODELS ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE EFFECTS OF BOG GROWTH ON HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS OR PEAT-FORMING PROCESSES. WE INTRODUCE FIVE CONCEPTUAL MODELS OF PEATLAND DEVELOPMENT THAT DIFFER IN HOW BOG SIZE AND SHAPE CHANGE OVER TIME, AND WE EXAMINE THE CONSEQUENCES OF EACH MODEL FOR HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. THIS EXERCISE SHOWS HOW BOG HEIGHT GROWTH AND LATERAL EXPANSION CHANGE THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS CONSTRAINING PEATLAND DYNAMICS, AND SO DETERMINE THE DIRECTION OF ECOSYSTEM DEVELOPMENT. WE LINK PEATLAND PROPERTIES TO THE FOUR GENERAL PROPERTIES OF ''COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS'' (CAS): SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY, LOCALIZED FLOWS, SELF-ORGANIZING STRUCTURE AND NONLINEARITY. WE ALSO PRESENT A FRAMEWORK FOR MODELING PEATLANDS AS CAS. IN THIS FRAMEWORK, THE SYSTEM IS DISAGGREGATED, BOTH VERTICALLY AND HORIZONTALLY, INTO A SET OF COMPONENTS THAT INTERACT LOCALLY THROUGH FLOWS OF ENERGY AND RESOURCES. BOTH INTERNAL DYNAMICS AND EXTERNAL FORCING DRIVE CHANGES IN HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND MICROHABITAT PATTERN, AND THESE AUTOGENIC AND ALLOGENIC CHANGES IN PEATLAND STRUCTURE AFFECT HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES, WHICH, IN TURN, CONSTRAIN PEATLAND DEVELOPMENT AND CARBON CYCLING.

THEY CONTAIN ABOUT 455 GT OF CARBON, ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO THE CARBON STORED IN ALL OF THE LIVING THINGS ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET, AND REPRESENTING AROUND 25% OF ALL THE SOIL CARBON ON EARTH. THESE BOGS ARE A SINK FOR ATMOSPHERIC CARBON AND THEIR CARBON UPTAKE ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 12% OF CURRENT HUMAN EMISSIONS. THEY VARY CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR FORM AND STRUCTURE AND ARE AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, INCLUDING THE STUDY OF PAST ENVIRONMENTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THEY ARE ALSO VALUABLE IN ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION. THEY ARE LOW IN BIODIVERSITY, BUT THEIR FAUNA AND FLORA ARE DISTINCTIVE AND MANY GROUPS ARE CONFINED TO THIS HABITAT. FOR ALL THESE REASONS, THE FUTURE CONSERVATION OF PEATLANDS IS A MATTER FOR CONCERN. THREATS TO PEATLANDS COME FROM DIRECT HUMAN EXPLOITATION IN THE FORM OF PEAT HARVESTING FOR ENERGY AND HORTICULTURE, AND DRAINAGE FOR FORESTRY. RISING ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS SHOULD CONTROL BOTH OF THESE PROCESSES IN THE WESTERN WORLD, BUT CONTINUED NORTHERN PEATLAND LOSSES ARE LIKELY LOCALLY, ESPECIALLY IN ASIA. PEATLAND DRAINAGE FOR FORESTRY OR AGRICULTURE WILL RESULT IN LOSSES OF CARBON TO THE ATMOSPHERE, ADDING TO THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT. HUMAN POPULATION PRESSURES, INDUSTRIALIZATION AND URBANIZATION ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE INFLUENCE IN THE BOREAL ZONE. FRAGMENTATION OF THE HABITAT IS NOT AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION BECAUSE BOGS ARE BY THEIR VERY NATURE 'ISLAND' HABITATS. ACIDIFICATION BY AERIAL POLLUTION MAY BE A LOCAL PROBLEM CLOSE TO SOURCES, BUT THE HABITAT IS NATURALLY ACID AND SHOULD NOT BE SEVERELY AFFECTED, THE INPUT OF AERIAL NUTRIENTS, HOWEVER, PARTICULARLY NITROGEN, COULD HAVE WIDESPREAD IMPACT ON BOGS, ENHANCING THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND ALTERING THEIR VEGETATION COMPOSITION. THE PHYSICAL REHABILITATION OF BOGS DAMAGED BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES PRESENTS MANY PROBLEMS, PARTICULARLY RELATING TO THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF PEAT STRUCTURE AND VEGETATION, BUT THE PROCESS CAN RESULT IN THE RE-FORMATION OF A CARBON SINK SO IT IS WORTH THE EFFORT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN ITS IMPACT ON BOGS. HIGHER TEMPERATURE (ESPECIALLY IF ACCOMPANIED BY RAISED ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS AND INCREASED NITRATE DEPOSITION) WILL ENHANCE PRODUCTIVITY, BUT WILL ALSO RESULT IN FASTER DECOMPOSITION RATES. THE OUTCOME OF THESE OPPOSING FACTORS FOR PEAT FORMATION WILL ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON THE FUTURE PATTERN OF PRECIPITATION. IF, AS SEEMS MOST LIKELY, SUMMER CONDITIONS BECOME WARMER AND DRIER IN CONTINENTAL REGIONS AND WINTERS BECOME MILDER AND WETTER, THE SUMMER DROUGHT COULD CAUSE PEAT LOSS AND BOG CONTRACTION. AN EXCESS OF DECOMPOSITION WILL LEAD TO BOGS BECOMING A CARBON SOURCE AND THUS A POSITIVE FEEDBACK IN GLOBAL WARMING. EMISSIONS OF METHANE AND NITROUS OXIDE WOULD ADD TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS PROBLEM, BUT LIKELY OXIDATION OF METHANE AND LOW N(2)O PRODUCTION MAY WELL MEAN THAT THIS IMPACT WILL NOT PROVE TO BE SIGNIFICANT. TREE INVASION OF BOGS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUMMER DROUGHT COULD LOCALLY LEAD TO INCREASED WATER LOSS THROUGH TRANSPIRATION, AND HIGHER HEAT ABSORPTION THROUGH ALBEDO CHANGE. THIS WILL ENHANCE THE DRYING EFFECT ON THE BOG SURFACE. OCEANIC MIRES WILL BE LESS SEVERELY AFFECTED IF THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN PRECIPITATION TAKES PLACE IN THESE REGIONS.

THE THREE MAJOR GREENHOUSE GASES ARE CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), METHANE (CH4), AND NITROUS OXIDE (N2O). AGRICULTURAL SOILS ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE THE MAIN SOURCE OF N2O EMISSIONS IN NEW ZEALAND, BUT PRODUCTION ESTIMATES TO DATE ARE SURROUNDED BY GREAT UNCERTAINTY. THIS PAPER REVIEWS OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF AGRICULTURAL N2O EMISSIONS, AND SUGGESTS DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS BY EVALUATING THE DEFAULT EMISSION FACTORS OF THE 1996 REVISED GUIDELINES FOR NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORIES OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (IPCC) FOR THE NEW ZEALAND SITUATION. THE EMISSION FACTORS CALCULATED FOR NEW ZEALAND AGRICULTURAL SOILS ARE GENERALLY WITHIN THE RANGE OF THE 1996 IPCC DEFAULT VALUES, BUT THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF RESEARCH DATA AVAILABLE HAMPERS A FULL EVALUATION OF THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THESE FACTORS FOR NEW ZEALAND. MORE LONG-TERM STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO REFINE OUR EMISSION FACTORS, PARTICULARLY THOSE FOR ANIMAL URINE AND DUNG RETURNED TO PASTURE. APPLICATION OF THE IPCC METHODOLOGY TO NEW ZEALAND IDENTIFIES HERBIVORE EXCREMENT AS THE SINGLE LARGEST POTENTIAL SOURCE OF ANTHROPOGENIC NO EMISSIONS (ABOUT 50% OF THE TOTAL EMISSION). IN ADDITION, RESEARCH IS ALSO REQUIRED FOR INDIRECT SOURCES OF N2O, BECAUSE ONLY LIMITED OVERSEAS DATA, AND NONE FROM NEW ZEALAND, ARE AVAILABLE. THE 1996 IPCC METHODOLOGY DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR VARIATIONS IN CLIMATIC AND SOIL PHYSICAL CONDITIONS, WHICH ARE KNOWN TO AFFECT N2O EMISSIONS. IN THE LONGER TERM, DEVELOPMENT OF ROBUST PROCESS-BASED MODELS, COUPLED WITH SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DATA SETS OF THE MAJOR DRIVERS OF N2O EMISSIONS, MAY THEREFORE BE A USEFUL APPROACH FOR OBTAINING NATIONAL EMISSION ESTIMATES FOR NEW ZEALAND. THIS WILL REQUIRE LONG-TERM MONITORING OF N2O EMISSIONS, UNDER VARIOUS LAND USES AND ON A NATIONAL NETWORK OF SITES.","NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM AGRICULTURAL SOILS IN NEW ZEALAND - A REVIEW OF CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH","JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND","REVIEW","SEP",2001,"10.1080/03014223.2001.9517667","MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES","WOS:000172321400003"

SINCE N2O IS A STABLE COMPOUND, IT IS TRANSPORTED TO THE STRATOSPHERE WHERE IT IS PHOTOCHEMICALLY OXIDIZED TO NITRIC OXIDE (NO), A CONTRIBUTOR TO CATALYTIC OZONE DEPLETION. POTENTIAL ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES OF N2O THAT HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED INCLUDE BIOMASS BURNING, FERTILIZATION, GROUND-WATER RELEASE THROUGH IRRIGATION AND FOSSIL FUEL COMBUSTION. UNTIL RECENTLY, PULVERIZED-COAL COMBUSTION WAS IMPLICATED AS THE MAIN SOURCE OF N2O EMISSIONS DUE TO ERRORS ENCOUNTERED IN SAMPLING. EMISSIONS FROM THESE UNITS ARE TYPICALLY LESS THAN 10 PPM N2O. FLUIDIZED-BED COMBUSTION (FBC) HAS EMERGED AS AN ADVANCED METHOD OF ENERGY PRODUCTION BY UTILITIES, BUT UNDER CURRENT DESIGNS THESE UNITS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO EMIT GREATER N2O) EMISSIONS THAN THEIR PULVERIZED-COAL COUNTERPARTS. THIS FACT IS RELATED TO LOWER COMBUSTION TEMPERATURES USED TO ENHANCE SOX/NOX CONTROL, WHICH, AS A CONSEQUENCE, INCREASES N2O EMISSIONS. NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM FBCS RANGE FROM 50-200 PPM. AT N2O CONCENTRATIONS OF 10) PPM, AND ASSUMING A 2.5% GROWTH RATE IN U.S. COAL-DERIVED ENERGY PRODUCTION WITH 50% OF THIS GENERATED BY FBCS, BY THE YEAR 2000 THIS PRODUCTION WOULD ACCOUNT FOR ONLY 1% OF THE TOTAL CURRENT GLOBAL N2O INVENTORY. NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM FBCS ARE STRONGLY DEPENDENT UPON FUEL TYPE, OPERATING TEMPERATURE, AND EXCESS AIR LEVEL. BASED ON CURRENT MEASUREMENTS AT STANDARD OPERATING CONDITIONS (1550-DEGREES-F AND 3.5% O2), FUELS SUCH AS WOOD, PEAT AND LIGNITE GENERALLY WILL HAVE N2O EMISSIONS RANGING FROM 15-50 PPM.

THE AIM OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS WAS TO COLLATE AND ANALYZE PUBLISHED STUDIES TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS THAT CONTROL CH4 EMISSIONS AND THE IMPACTS OF MANAGEMENT ON THE GAS FLUX FROM NORTHERN (LATITUDE 40 DEGREES TO 70 DEGREES N) PEATLANDS. THE ANALYSIS INCLUDES A TOTAL OF 87 STUDIES REPORTING MEASUREMENTS OF CH4 EMISSIONS TAKEN AT 186 SITES COVERING DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, PEATLAND TYPES, AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. RESULTS SHOW THAT CH4 EMISSIONS FROM NATURAL NORTHERN PEATLANDS ARE HIGHLY VARIABLE WITH A 95% CI OF 7.6-15.7 G C M(-2) YEAR(-1) FOR THE MEAN AND 3.3-6.3 G C M(-2) YEAR(-1) FOR THE MEDIAN. THE OVERALL ANNUAL AVERAGE (MEAN +/- SD) IS 12 +/- 21 G C M(-2) YEAR(-1) WITH THE HIGHEST EMISSIONS FROM FEN ECOSYSTEMS. METHANE EMISSIONS FROM NATURAL PEATLANDS ARE MAINLY CONTROLLED BY WATER TABLE (WT) DEPTH, PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, AND SOIL PH. ALTHOUGH MEAN ANNUAL AIR TEMPERATURE IS NOT A GOOD PREDICTOR OF CH4 EMISSIONS BY ITSELF, THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TEMPERATURE, PLANT COMMUNITY COVER, WT DEPTH, AND SOIL PH IS IMPORTANT. ACCORDING TO SHORT-TERM FORECASTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, THESE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS WILL BE THE MAIN DETERMINANT OF CH4 EMISSIONS FROM NORTHERN PEATLANDS.

TEMPERATURES IN BOREAL REGIONS ARE PREDICTED TO INCREASE DURING THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY WHICH MAY ACCELERATE CHANGES IN SOIL MICROBIAL PROCESSES AND PLANT COMMUNITY DYNAMICS. IN PARTICULAR, CLIMATE-DRIVEN CHANGES IN PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION MIGHT AFFECT THE PATHWAYS AND RATES OF METHANOGENESIS, THE PLANT-MEDIATED EMISSION OF METHANE, AND THE SCAVENGING OF METHANE BY METHANOTROPHIC BACTERIA. CLIMATE CHANGE MAY ALSO AFFECT METHANE CYCLING THROUGH CHANGES IN PORE WATER CHEMISTRY. TO DATE, THESE FEEDBACKS HAVE NOT BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE CARBON CYCLING COMPONENTS OF CLIMATE MODELS. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF SOIL WARMING AND WATER TABLE MANIPULATIONS ON METHANE CYCLING IN A FIELD MESOCOSM EXPERIMENT IN NORTHERN MINNESOTA, USA. LARGE INTACT SOIL MONOLITHS REMOVED FROM A BOG AND FEN RECEIVED INFRARED WARMING TREATMENTS CROSSED WITH WATER TABLE TREATMENTS FOR 6 YEARS. IN YEARS 5 AND 6, CONCENTRATIONS, FLUXES, AND ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS OF METHANE WERE MEASURED ALONG WITH ABOVEGROUND AND BELOWGROUND NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY AND PORE WATER CONCENTRATIONS OF ACETATE, SULFATE, AMMONIUM, NITRATE, AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON. WATER TABLE LEVEL WAS THE DOMINANT CONTROL OVER METHANE FLUX IN THE FEN MESOCOSMS, LIKELY THROUGH ITS EFFECT ON METHANE OXIDATION RATES. HOWEVER, PORE WATER CHEMISTRY AND PLANT PRODUCTIVITY WERE IMPORTANT SECONDARY FACTORS IN EXPLAINING METHANE FLUX IN THE FEN MESOCOSMS, AND THESE FACTORS APPEARED TO BE THE PREDOMINANT CONTROLS OVER METHANE FLUX IN THE BOG MESOCOSMS. THE WATER TABLE AND IR TREATMENTS HAD LARGE EFFECTS ON PORE WATER CHEMISTRY AND PLANT PRODUCTIVITY, SO THE INDIRECT EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE APPEAR TO BE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF CHANGING TEMPERATURE AND WATER TABLE LEVEL IN CONTROLLING FUTURE METHANE FLUXES FROM NORTHERN PEATLANDS. PORE WATER SULFATE, AMMONIUM, NITRATE, AND ACETATE HAD A RELATIVELY CONSISTENT NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH METHANE EMISSIONS, PORE WATER DOC HAD A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH METHANE EMISSIONS, AND BNPP HAD MIXED EFFECTS. THE BOG MESOCOSMS HAD MUCH HIGHER METHANE EMISSIONS AND PORE WATER METHANE CONCENTRATIONS THAN THE FEN MESOCOSMS, DESPITE A MUCH LOWER AVERAGE WATER TABLE LEVEL AND PEAT THAT IS A POOR SUBSTRATE FOR METHANOGENESIS. WE SUGGEST THAT THE RELATIVELY HIGH METHANE FLUXES IN THE BOG MESOCOSMS CAN BE EXPLAINED THROUGH THEIR LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF INHIBITORY PORE WATER COMPOUNDS, HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF DOC, AND HIGH PLANT PRODUCTIVITY. STABLE ISOTOPIC DATA FROM PORE WATER SUPPORT ACETATE FERMENTATION AS THE PRINCIPAL PATHWAY OF METHANOGENESIS IN BOG MESOCOSMS (MEAN DELTA(13) CH4 = -41.0%, MEAN DELTA D-CH4 = -190%). FEN MESOCOSMS HAD LOWER PORE WATER CONCENTRATIONS AND EMISSIONS OF METHANE THAN BOG MESOCOSMS, DESPITE MUCH HIGHER METHANE PRODUCTION POTENTIALS IN FEN PEAT. THE METHANE FROM THE FEN MESOCOSMS WAS ISOTOPICALLY HEAVY (MEAN DELTA(CH4)-C-13 = -28.9%, MEAN DELTA D-CH4 = -140%), SUGGESTING A STRONG OXIDATIVE SINK.

A RECENT MANAGEMENT TREND FOR DRAINED PEATLANDS IS THE CONTROL OF GREENHOUSE GASES (GHG) BY CHANGES IN AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES, PEATLAND RESTORATION OR PALUDICULTURE. DUE TO COMPLEX ANTAGONISTIC CONTROLS OF MOISTURE, WATER TABLE MANAGEMENT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO USE AS A METHOD FOR CONTROLLING GHG EMISSIONS. PAST STUDIES SHOW THAT THERE IS NO OBVIOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GHG EMISSION RATES AND CROP TYPE, TILLAGE INTENSITY OR FERTILIZATION RATES. FOR DRAINED PEAT SOILS, THE BEST USE OPTIONS CAN VARY FROM REWETTING WITH REDUCED EMISSION TO EFFICIENT SHORT TERM USE TO MAXIMIZE THE, PROFIT PER AMOUNT OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMITTED. THE GHG ACCOUNTING SHOULD CONSIDER THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE OF THE PEATLAND AND THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC BENEFITS PEATLANDS PROVIDE LOCALLY. CULTIVATING ENERGY CROPS IS A VIABLE OPTION ESPECIALLY FOR WET PEAT SOILS WITH POOR DRAINAGE, BUT HARVESTING REMAINS A CHALLENGE DUE TO TRACTABILITY OF WET SOILS. PALUDICULTURE IN LOWLAND FLOODPLAINS CAN BE A TOOL TO MITIGATE REGIONAL FLOODING ALLOWING WATER TO BE STORED ON THESE LANDS WITHOUT MUCH HARM TO CROPS. THIS CAN ALSO INCREASE REGIONAL BIODIVERSITY PROVIDING IMPORTANT HABITATS FOR BIRDS AND MOISTURE TOLERANT PLANT SPECIES. HOWEVER, ON MANY PEATLANDS REWETTING IS NOT POSSIBLE DUE TO THEIR POSITION IN THE LANDSCAPE AND THE ASSOCIATED DIFFICULTY TO MAINTAIN A HIGH STABLE WATER TABLE. WHILE THE GOAL OF REWETTING OFTEN IS TO ENCOURAGE THE RETURN OF PEAT FORMING PLANTS AND THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THEY PROVIDE SUCH AS CARBON SEQUESTRATION, IT IS NOT WELL KNOWN IF THESE PLANTS WILL GROW ON PEAT SOILS THAT HAVE BEEN ALTERED BY THE PROCESS OF DRAINAGE AND MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER PEAT QUALITY AND HYDROLOGY WHEN CHOOSING MANAGEMENT OPTIONS. MAPPING OF SITES IS RECOMMENDED AS A MANAGEMENT TOOL TO GUIDE ACTIONS. THE ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THE SITES SHOULD BE ASSESSED BOTH FOR CONTINUED CULTIVATION BUT ALSO FOR OTHER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES SUCH AS RESTORATION AND HYDROLOGICAL FUNCTIONS (FLOOD CONTROL). FARMERS NEED ADVICE, TOOLS AND TRAINING TO FIND THE BEST AFTER-USE OPTION. BIOFUELS MIGHT PROVIDE A COST-EFFICIENT AFTER USE OPTION FOR SOME SITES.

WET SOILS, COVER AN AREA GREATER THAN 12.1 MILLION KM(2); INLAND WETLANDS DELIVER AT LEAST INT$27.0 TRILLION IN TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE BENEFITS. HOWEVER, DUE TO THEIR INTIMATE ASSOCIATION WITH WET ENVIRONMENTS, WET SOILS ARE AT RISK OF DEGRADATION DURING DROUGHT EVENTS. THIS REVIEW INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF DROUGHT ON WET SOILS, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE CHANGES IN SOIL GEOCHEMISTRY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. IT IS CLEAR FROM THIS REVIEW THAT DROUGHT POSES A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO WET SOILS, A THREAT WHICH CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE BEFORE AN EVENT BUT WHICH POSES A CATASTROPHIC RISK TO SOME SITES. DROUGHT CAUSES OXYGEN PENETRATION TO INCREASE IN WET SOILS, LEADING TO AN INCREASE IN OXIDATION OF ORGANIC MATTER AND REDUCED INORGANIC SPECIES (E.G. SULFIDES). OXIDATION OF THESE MATERIALS CAN LEAD TO SOIL ACIDIFICATION, METAL MOBILIZATION AND TO NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON WATER QUALITY. INCREASED OXYGEN IN THE SOIL PROFILE ALSO AFFECTS BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLING, WITH INCREASED PRODUCTION OF NITROUS OXIDE AND DECREASED PRODUCTION OF METHANE. EFFECTS OF DROUGHT DIFFER BETWEEN PEAT AND MINERAL SOIL TYPES AND SUBTYPES. WET SOILS UNDERGO MAJOR CHRONOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATIONS AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL CHANGES IN THE ALTERATION OF ENVIRONMENTS OCCURRING BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER DROUGHT CONDITIONS. WATER CONDITIONS (I.E. SUBAQUEOUS, SATURATED, UNSATURATED AND RESATURATED) ALSO PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN CHRONOLOGICAL SOIL TRANSFORMATIONS. SOILS MAY NOT EASILY RECOVER BETWEEN SEVERE DROUGHTS AND INSTEAD ENTER ALTERNATIVE STABLE STATES. THIS REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS SUBSTANTIAL GAPS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTS OF DROUGHT ON WET SOILS AND SHOWS THAT PREVIOUS STUDIES OVERREPRESENT RELATIVELY SMALL GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS.","DROUGHT EFFECTS ON WET SOILS IN INLAND WETLANDS AND PEATLANDS","EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS","REVIEW","NOV",2020,"10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103387","GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000588283400036"

HEREIN, WE REVIEW THE TAXONOMY AND PHYSIOLOGICAL ECOLOGY OF THE MICROORGANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR METHANE PRODUCTION IN PEATLANDS. COMMON IN PEAT SOILS ARE FIVE OF THE EIGHT DESCRIBED ORDERS OF METHANOGENS SPANNING THREE PHYLA (EURYARCHAEOTA, HALOBACTEROTA AND THERMOPLASMATOTA). THE PHYLOGENETIC AFFILIATION OF SEQUENCES FOUND IN PEAT SUGGEST THAT MEMBERS OF THE THUS-FAR-UNCULTIVATED GROUP CANDIDATUS BATHYARCHAEOTA (REPRESENTING A FOURTH PHYLUM) MAY BE INVOLVED IN METHANE CYCLING, EITHER ANAEROBIC OXIDATION OF METHANE AND/OR METHANOGENESIS, AS AT LEAST A FEW ORGANISMS WITHIN THIS GROUP CONTAIN THE ESSENTIAL GENE, MCRA, ACCORDING TO METAGENOMIC DATA. METHANOGENS IN PEATLANDS ARE NOTORIOUSLY CHALLENGING TO ENRICH AND ISOLATE; THUS, MUCH REMAINS UNKNOWN ABOUT THEIR PHYSIOLOGY AND HOW METHANOGEN COMMUNITIES WILL RESPOND TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES. CONSISTENT PATTERNS OF CHANGES IN METHANOGEN COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED ACROSS STUDIES IN PERMAFROST PEATLAND THAW WHERE THE RESULTING DEGRADED FEATURE IS THERMOKARST.

HERE, WE CONDUCTED A DATA SYNTHESIS OF 236 OBSERVATIONS FROM 52 FIELD EXPERIMENTS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF THREE IMPORTANT GLOBAL CHANGES (WARMING, NITROGEN ADDITION, AND VEGETATION COMPOSITION CHANGE) ON THREE MAJOR GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) FLUXES: CO2, CH4, AND N2O. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT (I) GHG RESPONSES TO WARMING VARIED AMONG WARMING METHODS, BETWEEN AIR TEMPERATURE INCREASE RATES, AND BETWEEN WARMING DURATIONS; (II) GHG RESPONSES TO N ADDITION VARIED BETWEEN PEATLAND TYPES, BETWEEN N FORMS, BETWEEN N CONCENTRATIONS, AND BETWEEN EXPERIMENTAL DURATIONS; (III) THE RESPONSE RATES OF GHGS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS (MEAN ANNUAL PRECIPITATION, MAP; AND WATER TABLE LEVEL, WTL); (IV) THE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) CONSIDERABLY INCREASED UNDER THESE GLOBAL CHANGES, WHICH INDICATES THAT COOLING FUNCTION OF PEATLANDS WILL BE WEAKENED. OVERALL, GIVEN THESE GLOBAL CHANGES OCCUR SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE INTERACTION OF THEM ON GHG FLUXES SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF STUDIES IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS ARE NEEDED TO COMPREHENSIVELY UNDERSTAND AND ACCURATELY PREDICT GHG EMISSIONS FROM PEATLANDS.","GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM PEATLANDS UNDER MANIPULATED WARMING, NITROGEN ADDITION, AND VEGETATION COMPOSITION CHANGE: A REVIEW AND DATA SYNTHESIS","ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS","REVIEW","DEC",2020,"10.1139/er-2019-0064","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000595541100006"

DRAINED ORGANIC SOILS EXEMPLIFY SYSTEMS WHERE MANY STUDIES ARE STILL CARRIED OUT WITH RELATIVELY SMALL RESOURCES, SEVERAL METHODOLOGIES AND MANUALLY OPERATED SYSTEMS, WHICH FURTHER INVOLVE DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR THE DETAILED DESIGN OF THE MEASUREMENT AND DATA ANALYSIS PROTOCOLS FOR DERIVING THE ANNUAL FLUX. IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO SET CERTAIN GUIDELINES FOR HOW TO MEASURE AND REPORT THE DATA, SO THAT DATA FROM INDIVIDUAL STUDIES COULD ALSO BE USED IN SYNTHESIS WORK BASED ON DATA COLLATION AND MODELLING. SUCH SYNTHESIS WORK IS NECESSARY FOR DECIPHERING GENERAL PATTERNS AND TRENDS RELATED TO, E.G., SITE TYPES, CLIMATE, AND MANAGEMENT, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CORRESPONDING EMISSION FACTORS, I.E. ESTIMATES OF THE NET ANNUAL SOIL GHG EMISSION AND REMOVAL, WHICH CAN BE USED IN GHG INVENTORIES. DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIFIC EMISSION FACTORS ALSO SETS PREREQUISITES FOR THE BACKGROUND OR ENVIRONMENTAL DATA TO BE REPORTED IN INDIVIDUAL STUDIES. WE ARGUE THAT WIDE APPLICABILITY GREATLY INCREASES THE VALUE OF INDIVIDUAL STUDIES. AN OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO SUPPORT FUTURE MONITORING CAMPAIGNS IN OBTAINING HIGH-VALUE DATA. WE ANALYSED PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS PRESENTING CO2, CH4 AND N2O FLUX DATA FOR DRAINED ORGANIC FOREST SOILS IN BOREAL AND TEMPERATE CLIMATE ZONES, FOCUSING ON DATA THAT HAVE BEEN USED, OR HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE USED, FOR ESTIMATING NET ANNUAL SOIL GHG EMISSIONS AND REMOVALS.

HOWEVER, THE DRIVING MECHANISM BY WHICH SOIL LABILE CARBON AND NITROGEN AFFECT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM WETLAND ECOSYSTEMS UNDER GLOBAL NITROGEN INPUT IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. WORKING OUT THE DRIVING FACTOR OF NITROGEN INPUT ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS IS CRITICAL TO REDUCING GLOBAL WARMING FROM NITROGEN INPUT. THUS, WE SYNTHESIZED 72 PUBLISHED STUDIES (2144 PAIRED OBSERVATIONS) OF GREENHOUSE GAS FLUXES AND SOIL LABILE COMPOUNDS OF CARBON AND NITROGEN (AMMONIUM, NITRATE, DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON, SOIL MICROBIAL BIOMASS NITROGEN AND CARBON), TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF LABILE CARBON AND NITROGEN ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS UNDER GLOBAL NITROGEN INPUT. ACROSS THE DATA SET, NITROGEN INPUT SIGNIFICANTLY PROMOTED CARBON DIOXIDE, METHANE AND NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS. IN PARTICULAR, AT LOWER NITROGEN RATES (<100 KG HA(-1).YR(-1)) AND WITH ADDED AMMONIUM COMPOUNDS, FRESHWATER WETLAND SIGNIFICANTLY PROMOTED CARBON DIOXIDE AND METHANE EMISSIONS. PEATLAND WAS THE LARGEST NITROUS OXIDE SOURCE UNDER THESE CONDITIONS. THIS META-ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALED THAT NITROGEN INPUT STIMULATED DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON, AMMONIUM, NITRATE, MICROBIAL BIOMASS CARBON AND MICROBIAL BIOMASS NITROGEN ACCUMULATION IN THE WETLAND ECOSYSTEM. THE VARIATION-PARTITIONING ANALYSIS AND STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL WERE USED TO ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GREENHOUSE GAS AND LABILE CARBON AND NITROGEN FURTHER. THESE RESULTS REVEALED THAT DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC) IS THE PRIMARY FACTOR DRIVING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION FROM WETLANDS UNDER GLOBAL NITROGEN INPUT, WHEREAS MICROBIAL BIOMASS CARBON (MBC) MORE DIRECTLY AFFECTS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION THAN OTHER LABILE CARBON AND NITROGEN.

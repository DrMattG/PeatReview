IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATE THE MOLECULAR COMPOSITION OF FRESHLY EMITTED BIOMASS BURNING ORGANIC AEROSOL (BBOA) SAMPLES COLLECTED DURING TEST BURNS OF SAWGRASS, PEAT, PONDEROSA PINE, AND BLACK SPRUCE. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT BOTH THE BRC ABSORPTION AND THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF LIGHT-ABSORBING COMPOUNDS DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE TYPE OF BIOMASS FUELS. COMMON BRC CHROMOPHORES IN THE SELECTED BBOA SAMPLES INCLUDE NITRO-AROMATICS, POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBON DERIVATIVES, AND POLYPHENOLS SPANNING A WIDE RANGE OF MOLECULAR WEIGHTS, STRUCTURES, AND LIGHT ABSORPTION PROPERTIES. A NUMBER OF BIOFUEL-SPECIFIC BRC CHROMOPHORES ARE OBSERVED, INDICATING THAT SOME OF THEM MAY BE USED AS SOURCE-SPECIFIC MARKERS OF BRC. ON AVERAGE, SIMILAR TO 50% OF THE LIGHT ABSORPTION IN THE SOLVENT-EXTRACTABLE FRACTION OF BBOA CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF STRONG BRC CHROMOPHORES. THE ABSORPTION COEFFICIENTS OF BBOA ARE AFFECTED BY SOLAR PHOTOLYSIS. SPECIFICALLY, UNDER TYPICAL ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS, THE 300 NM ABSORBANCE DECAYS WITH A HALF-LIFE OF SIMILAR TO 16 H. A MOLECULAR CORRIDOR ANALYSIS OF THE BBOA VOLATILITY DISTRIBUTION SUGGESTS THAT MANY BRC COMPOUNDS IN THE FRESH BBOA HAVE LOW SATURATION MASS CONCENTRATION (<1 MU G M-3) AND WILL BE RETAINED IN THE PARTICLE PHASE UNDER ATMOSPHERICALLY RELEVANT CONDITIONS.","MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF BROWN CARBON IN BIOMASS BURNING AEROSOL PARTICLES","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY","ARTICLE","NOV 1",2016,"10.1021/acs.est.6b03024","ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000386991100044"

HOWEVER, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER THESE TEMPERATURE-DRIVEN TRENDS WILL CONTINUE, OR WHETHER OTHER FACTORS-FOR EXAMPLE, PHOTOPERIOD-WILL BECOME MORE IMPORTANT AS WARMING EXCEEDS THE BOUNDS OF HISTORICAL VARIABILITY(4,5). HERE WE USE PHENOLOGICAL TRANSITION DATES DERIVED FROM DIGITAL REPEAT(5) PHOTOGRAPHY(6) TO SHOW THAT EXPERIMENTAL WHOLE-ECOSYSTEM WARMING TREATMENTS(7) OF UP TO +9 DEGREES C LINEARLY CORRELATE WITH A DELAYED AUTUMN GREEN-DOWN AND ADVANCED SPRING GREEN-UP OF THE DOMINANT WOODY SPECIES IN A BOREAL PICEA-SPHAGNUM BOG. RESULTS WERE CONFIRMED BY DIRECT OBSERVATION OF BOTH VEGETATIVE AND REPRODUCTIVE PHENOLOGY OF THESE AND OTHER BOG PLANT SPECIES, AND BY MULTIPLE YEARS OF OBSERVATIONS. THERE WAS LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT THE OBSERVED RESPONSES WERE CONSTRAINED BY PHOTOPERIOD. OUR RESULTS INDICATE A LIKELY EXTENSION OF THE PERIOD OF VEGETATION ACTIVITY BY 1-2 WEEKS UNDER A 'CO2 STABILIZATION' CLIMATE SCENARIO (+2.6 +/- 0.7 DEGREES C), AND 3-6 WEEKS UNDER A 'HIGH-CO2 EMISSION' SCENARIO (+5.9 +/- 1.1 DEGREES C), BY THE END OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. WE ALSO OBSERVED SEVERE TISSUE MORTALITY IN THE WARMEST ENCLOSURES AFTER A SEVERE SPRING FROST EVENT. FAILURE TO CUE TO PHOTOPERIOD RESULTED IN PRECOCIOUS GREEN-UP AND A PREMATURE LOSS OF FROST HARDINESS(8), WHICH SUGGESTS THAT VULNERABILITY TO SPRING FROST DAMAGE WILL INCREASE IN A WARMER WORLD(9,10). VEGETATION STRATEGIES THAT HAVE EVOLVED TO BALANCE TRADEOFFS ASSOCIATED WITH PHENOLOGICAL TEMPERATURE TRACKING MAY BE OPTIMAL UNDER HISTORICAL CLIMATES, BUT THESE STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE OPTIMIZED FOR FUTURE CLIMATE REGIMES. THESE IN SITU EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ARE OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE BECAUSE BOREAL FORESTS HAVE BOTH A CIRCUMPOLAR DISTRIBUTION AND A KEY ROLE IN THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE(11).","ECOSYSTEM WARMING EXTENDS VEGETATION ACTIVITY BUT HEIGHTENS VULNERABILITY TO COLD TEMPERATURES","NATURE","ARTICLE","AUG 16",2018,"10.1038/s41586-018-0399-1","MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES","WOS:000441673400040"

EMISSIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES WERE MEASURED WITH IDENTICAL METHODS. SITE-AVERAGED GHG BUDGETS WERE SURPRISINGLY VARIABLE (29.2 +/- 17.4 T CO2-EQ. HA(-1)YR(-1)) AND PARTIALLY HIGHER THAN ALL PUBLISHED DATA AND THE IPCC DEFAULT EMISSION FACTORS FOR GHG INVENTORIES. GENERALLY, CO2 (27.7 +/- 17.3 T CO(2)HA(-1)YR(-1)) DOMINATED THE GHG BUDGET. NITROUS OXIDE (2.3 +/- 2.4KG N2O-N HA(-1)YR(-1)) AND METHANE EMISSIONS (30.8 +/- 69.8KG CH4-C HA(-1)YR(-1)) WERE LOWER THAN EXPECTED EXCEPT FOR CH4 EMISSIONS FROM NUTRIENT-POOR ACIDIC SITES. AT SINGLE PEATLANDS, CO2 EMISSIONS CLEARLY INCREASED WITH DEEPER MEAN WATER TABLE DEPTH (WTD), BUT THERE WAS NO GENERAL DEPENDENCY OF CO2 ON WTD FOR THE COMPLETE DATA SET.

AS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT ANTHROPOGENIC GREENHOUSE GAS IN THE ATMOSPHERE AFTER CO2, CH4 IS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE FEEDBACKS. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE PAUCITY OF DATA, WETLAND CH4 FEEDBACKS WERE NOT FULLY ASSESSED IN THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE FIFTH ASSESSMENT REPORT. THE DEGREE TO WHICH FUTURE EXPANSION OF WETLANDS AND CH4 EMISSIONS WILL EVOLVE AND CONSEQUENTLY DRIVE CLIMATE FEEDBACKS IS THUS A QUESTION OF MAJOR CONCERN. HERE WE PRESENT AN ENSEMBLE ESTIMATE OF WETLAND CH4 EMISSIONS DRIVEN BY 38 GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY. WE FIND THAT CLIMATE CHANGE-INDUCED INCREASES IN BOREAL WETLAND EXTENT AND TEMPERATURE-DRIVEN INCREASES IN TROPICAL CH4 EMISSIONS WILL DOMINATE ANTHROPOGENIC CH4 EMISSIONS BY 38 TO 56% TOWARD THE END OF THE 21ST CENTURY UNDER THE REPRESENTATIVE CONCENTRATION PATHWAY (RCP2.6). DEPENDING ON SCENARIOS, WETLAND CH4 FEEDBACKS TRANSLATE TO AN INCREASE IN ADDITIONAL GLOBAL MEAN RADIATIVE FORCING OF 0.04W.M(-2) TO 0.19W.M(-2) BY THE END OF THE 21ST CENTURY. UNDER THE ""WORST-CASE"" RCP8.5 SCENARIO, WITH NO CLIMATE MITIGATION, BOREAL CH4 EMISSIONS ARE ENHANCED BY 18.05 TG TO 41.69 TG, DUE TO THAWING OF INUNDATED AREAS DURING THE COLD SEASON (DECEMBER TO MAY) AND RISING TEMPERATURE, WHILE TROPICAL CH4 EMISSIONS ACCELERATE WITH A TOTAL INCREMENT OF 48.36 TG TO 87.37 TG BY 2099.

WE COMPILED PEATLAND PLANT MACROFOSSIL RECORDS FOR THE NORTHERN PERMAFROST ZONE (515 CORES FROM 280 SITES) AND CLASSIFIED SAMPLES BY VEGETATION TYPE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLASS (FEN, BOG, TUNDRA AND BOREAL PERMAFROST, AND THAWED PERMAFROST).

IN THIS STUDY, A SEQUENTIAL CHEMICAL EXTRACTION PROCEDURE WAS DEVELOPED TO REVEAL THE DIVERSITY OF ORGANIC MATTER (OM) IN DIFFERENT ECOSYSTEMS AND WAS COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED PROTOCOL USING PARALLEL SOLVENT EXTRACTION (PSE). WE COMPARED SIX EXTRACTION METHODS USING THREE SAMPLE TYPES, PEAT SOIL, SPRUCE FOREST SOIL AND RIVER SEDIMENT, SO AS TO SELECT THE BEST METHOD FOR EXTRACTING A REPRESENTATIVE FRACTION OF ORGANIC MATTER FROM SOILS AND SEDIMENTS FROM A WIDE RANGE OF ECOSYSTEMS. WE ESTIMATED THE EXTRACTION YIELD OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC) BY TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON ANALYSIS, AND MEASURED THE COMPOSITION OF EXTRACTED OM USING HIGH RESOLUTION MASS SPECTROMETRY. THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT OM COMPOSITION DEPENDS PRIMARILY ON SOIL AND SEDIMENT CHARACTERISTICS. TWO SEQUENTIAL EXTRACTION PROTOCOLS, PROGRESSING FROM POLAR TO NON-POLAR SOLVENTS, WERE FOUND TO PROVIDE THE HIGHEST NUMBER AND DIVERSITY OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS EXTRACTED FROM THE SOIL AND SEDIMENTS.

WLD CLEARLY AFFECTED THE CONTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENT PLANT FUNCTIONAL TYPES (PFTS) IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE BIOMASS THEY PRODUCED: SHRUBS BENEFITED WHILE FORBS AND MOSSES SUFFERED. THESE RESPONSES DID NOT DEPEND ON THE WARMING TREATMENT. FOLLOWING WLD, ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS PRODUCTION DECREASED MAINLY DUE TO REDUCED GROWTH OF MOSSES IN THE SOUTHERN FEN. ABOVEGROUND VASCULAR PLANT BIOMASS PRODUCTION REMAINED UNCHANGED BUT THE CONTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENT PFTS CHANGED. THE OBSERVED CHANGES WERE ALSO REFLECTED IN PLANT PHENOLOGY, WITH DIFFERENT PFTS SHOWING DIFFERENT RESPONSES. BELOWGROUND PRODUCTION INCREASED FOLLOWING WLD IN THE NORTHERN FEN ONLY, BUT AN INCREASE IN THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF SHRUBS AND FORBS WAS OBSERVED IN BOTH SITES, WHILE SEDGE CONTRIBUTION DECREASED. MODERATE WARMING ALONE SEEMS NOT ABLE TO DRIVE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PLANT PRODUCTIVITY OR COMMUNITY COMPOSITION IN THESE WET ECOSYSTEMS.

UNDERSTANDING THE DRIVERS AND CONTROLS OF BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES ON LONG TIME SCALES WOULD IMPROVE BOTH OUR KNOWLEDGE OF FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES AND OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT COMMUNITY STATES. IN THIS SPECIFIC ECOSYSTEM, BOG LAKES PLAY A DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE ROLE IN GLOBAL CARBON CYCLING, AND THE INFORMATION PRESENTED HERE MAY ULTIMATELY HELP REFINE CARBON BUDGETS FOR THESE LAKES.

FIRE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATUS OF WATER SYSTEMS, ALTER SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE CARBON CYCLE (E.G. ABOVE- AND BELOW-GROUND CARBON STORAGE) AND TRIGGER CHANGES IN VEGETATION TYPE AND STRUCTURE. GLOBALLY, FIRE IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF LAND MANAGEMENT IN FIRE-PRONE REGIONS IN, E.G. AUSTRALIA, THE USA AND SOME MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES TO MITIGATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES AND SUSTAIN HEALTHY ECOSYSTEMS. IN THE LESS-FIRE PRONE UK, FIRE HAS A LONG HISTORY OF USAGE IN MANAGEMENT FOR ENHANCING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF HEATHER, RED GROUSE AND SHEEP. THIS DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT SOCIOECONOMIC TRADITION OF BURNING UNDERLIES SOME OF THE CONTROVERSY IN RECENT DECADES IN THE UK AROUND THE USE OF FIRE. NEGATIVE PUBLIC OPINION AND OPPOSITION FROM POPULAR MEDIA HAVE HIGHLIGHTED CONCERNS AROUND THE DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS BURNING CAN HAVE ON THE HEALTH AND DIVERSITY OF UPLAND HABITATS. IT IS EVIDENT THERE ARE MANY GAPS IN THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AROUND THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF PRESCRIBED BURNING IN LESS FIRE-PRONE REGIONS (E.G. UK). LAND OWNERS AND MANAGERS REQUIRE A GREATER LEVEL OF CERTAINTY ON THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF PRESCRIBED BURNING IN COMPARISON TO OTHER TECHNIQUES TO BETTER INFORM MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THIS GAP BY PROVIDING A CRITICAL REVIEW OF PUBLISHED WORK AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS RELATED TO THE IMPACTS OF PRESCRIBED FIRE ON THREE KEY ASPECTS OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES: (I) WATER QUALITY, (II) CARBON DYNAMICS AND (III) HABITAT COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE (BIODIVERSITY). ITS OVERALL AIMS ARE TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART FOR RESEARCHERS, LAND OWNERS, MANAGERS AND POLICY MAKERS ON THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF THE USE OF BURNING AND TO INFORM THE WIDER DEBATE ABOUT THE PLACE OF FIRE IN MODERN CONSERVATION AND LAND MANAGEMENT IN HUMID TEMPERATE ECOSYSTEMS.

ALVEOLATA (CILIATES) WAS THE MOST RESPONSIVE PROTOZOA GROUP AS CONFIRMED BY ANALYSIS OF BOTH SSU RRNA GENES AND SSU RRNA. A STIMULATION OF ALPHAPROTEOBACTERIAL METHANOTROPHS ON PECTIN WAS CONSISTENTLY SHOWN BY RRNA AND MRNA DATA.

FROM 2015-2016, 18 REPLICATES OF STEPPED BIORETENTION SYSTEMS, WHICH INCLUDED A 400 MM DEEP PLANTING LAYER, A 200 MM DEEP TRANSITION LAYER AND A 200 MM GRAVEL LAYER PLANTED WITH RADERMACHERA HAINANENSIS (MERR.), JUNCUS EFFUSUS (L.), VETIVERIA ZIZANIOIDES (L.), OPHIOPOGON JAPONICUS (LINN.

THE STEPPED COLUMNS PLANTED WITH MEDICAGO SATIVA (L.). SHOWED POOR NITROGEN REMOVAL (E.G., THE RRTN (REMOVAL RATE OF TN) WAS FROM-29.8% TO-123.0%), WHILE THOSE PLANTED WITH RADERMACHERA HAINANENSIS (MERR.), JUNCUS EFFUSUS (L.), OPHIOPOGON JAPONICAS (LINN.

NITROGEN WOULD BE RELEASED FROM THE SYSTEMS (E.G., THE AVERAGE RRTN WAS-178.0%) WHEN PEAT SOIL WAS MIXED IN THE PLANTING LAYER AT A RATIO OF 20%. AFTER RETROFITTING THE FLOW PATTERN WITHIN THE STEPPED COLUMNS, U FLOW PATTERN WAS MORE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF NITROGEN REMOVAL. IN THE 1ST, 2ND, 4TH, 5TH, 10TH AND 11TH SYSTEMS, THE AVERAGE RRTN AND RRNO3-N (REMOVAL RATE OF NO3-N) IN THE SYSTEMS WITH U FLOW PATTERN WERE 1.2-7.0% AND 5.0-5.8%, BOTH HIGHER THAN THOSE WITH W FLOW PATTERN. THROUGH LEACHING DYNAMICS ANALYSIS, NH3-N-C (NH3-N CONCENTRATION) OF ALL EFFLUENT SAMPLES WAS <0.5 MG/L, BUT THE CONCENTRATIONS OF TN AND NO3 N WERE INCREASED WITH THE DURATION OF RAINFALL EVENTS. GENERALLY, RRTN WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED TO TN-C (TN CONCENTRATION), NH3-N-C, NO3-N-C (NO3 N CONCENTRATION) AND D (DEPTH OF SATURATED ZONE), WHILE RRNH3-N (REMOVAL RATE OF NH3-N) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ID (INTERVAL DAYS BETWEEN RAINFALL EVENTS).

THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A NEW VERSION OF JULES (VN4.3_ PERMAFROST) IN WHICH THE SOIL VERTICAL DIMENSION IS ADDED TO THE SOIL CARBON MODEL, WITH A SET OF FOUR POOLS IN EVERY SOIL LAYER. THE RESPIRATION RATE IN EACH SOIL LAYER DEPENDS ON THE TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE CONDITIONS IN THAT LAYER. CRYOTURBATION/BIOTURBATION PROCESSES, WHICH TRANSFER SOIL CARBON BETWEEN LAYERS, ARE REPRESENTED BY DIFFUSIVE MIXING. THE LITTER INPUTS AND THE SOIL RESPIRATION ARE BOTH PARAMETRIZED TO DECREASE WITH INCREASING DEPTH. THE MODEL NOW INCLUDES A TRACER SO THAT SELECTED SOIL CARBON CAN BE LABELLED AND TRACKED THROUGH A SIMULATION. SIMULATIONS SHOW AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE LARGE-SCALE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF SOIL CARBON OVER THE STANDARD VERSION OF JULES (VN4.3). LIKE THE STANDARD VERSION OF JULES, THE VERTICALLY DISCRETIZED MODEL IS STILL UNABLE TO SIMULATE ENOUGH SOIL CARBON IN THE TUNDRA REGIONS. THIS IS IN PART BECAUSE JULES UNDERESTIMATES THE PLANT PRODUCTIVITY OVER THE TUNDRA, BUT ALSO BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THE PROCESSES RELEVANT FOR THE ACCUMULATION OF PERMAFROST CARBON, SUCH AS PEAT DEVELOPMENT, ARE INCLUDED IN THE MODEL. IN COMPARISON WITH THE STANDARD MODEL, THE VERTICALLY DISCRETIZED MODEL SHOWS A DELAY IN THE ONSET OF SOIL RESPIRATION IN THE SPRING, RESULTING IN AN INCREASED NET UPTAKE OF CARBON DURING THIS TIME. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A MORE SUITABLE REPRESENTATION OF PERMAFROST CARBON FOR QUANTIFYING THE PERMAFROST CARBON FEEDBACK WITHIN UKESM, THE DEEP SOIL CARBON IN THE PERMAFROST REGION (BELOW 1 M) WAS INITIALIZED USING THE OBSERVED SOIL CARBON. THERE IS NOW A SLIGHT DRIFT IN THE SOIL CARBON (< 0.018% DECADE(-1)), BUT THE CHANGE IN SIMULATED SOIL CARBON OVER THE 20TH CENTURY, WHEN THERE IS LITTLE CLIMATE CHANGE, IS COMPARABLE TO THE ORIGINAL VERTICALLY DISCRETIZED MODEL AND SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THE DRIFT.","A VERTICAL REPRESENTATION OF SOIL CARBON IN THE JULES LAND SURFACE SCHEME (VN4.3_PERMAFROST) WITH A FOCUS ON PERMAFROST REGIONS","GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT","ARTICLE","FEB 24",2017,"10.5194/gmd-10-959-2017","GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000395391400001"

SINCE THEN, HOWEVER, THE AVERAGE WATER TABLE LEVEL AT THIS SITE HAS INCREASED, PROVIDING A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE HOW WETLAND CARBON FLUXES ARE AFFECTED BY INTERANNUAL AIR TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCES AS WELL AS CHANGING WATER TABLE LEVELS. WATER TABLE LEVEL, AS MEASURED BY WATER DISCHARGE, WAS CORRELATED WITH R-ECO AND GPP AT INTERANNUAL TIME SCALES. HOWEVER, AIR TEMPERATURE HAD A STRONG CORRELATION WITH R-ECO, GPP, AND NET ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY (NEP) AT MONTHLY TIME SCALES AND CORRELATED WITH NEP AT INTER-ANNUAL TIME SCALES. METHANE FLUX WAS STRONGLY TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED AT SEASONAL TIME SCALES, INCREASING AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE FROM APRIL TO JULY. ANNUAL METHANE EMISSIONS WERE 51 G C M(-2). OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT OVER MULTI-YEAR TIMESCALES, WATER TABLE FLUCTUATIONS CAN HAVE LIMITED EFFECTS ON WETLAND NET CARBON FLUXES AND INSTEAD AT LOST CREEK ANNUAL TEMPERATURE IS THE BEST PREDICTOR OF INTERANNUAL VARIATION.","WETLAND FLUX CONTROLS: HOW DOES INTERACTING WATER TABLE LEVELS AND TEMPERATURE INFLUENCE CARBON DIOXIDE AND METHANE FLUXES IN NORTHERN WISCONSIN?","BIOGEOCHEMISTRY","ARTICLE","JAN",2018,"10.1007/s10533-017-0414-x","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000423362600002"

HERE WE EVALUATE THE SIMULATION OF TUNDRA CARBON STOCKS AND FLUXES IN THREE LAND SURFACE SCHEMES THAT EACH FORM PART OF MAJOR EARTH SYSTEM MODELS (JSBACH, GERMANY; JULES, UK; ORCHIDEE, FRANCE). WE USE A SITE-LEVEL APPROACH IN WHICH COMPREHENSIVE, HIGH-FREQUENCY DATASETS ALLOW US TO DISENTANGLE THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT PROCESSES.

THEREFORE, SIMULATING THE CORRECT LAI IS ONE OF THE FIRST PRIORITIES. LAI DEPENDS QUITE STRONGLY ON CLIMATIC VARIABLES ALONE, AS WE SEE BY THE FACT THAT THE DYNAMIC VEGETATION MODEL CAN SIMULATE MOST OF THE DIFFERENCES IN LAI BETWEEN SITES, BASED ALMOST ENTIRELY ON CLIMATE INPUTS. HOWEVER, WE ALSO IDENTIFY AN INFLUENCE FROM NUTRIENT LIMITATION AS THE LAI BECOMES TOO LARGE AT SOME OF THE MORE NUTRIENT-LIMITED SITES. WE CONCLUDE THAT INCLUDING MOSS AS WELL AS VASCULAR PLANTS IS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE TO THE CARBON BUDGET, AS MOSS CONTRIBUTES A LARGE FRACTION TO THE SEASONAL CO2 FLUX IN NUTRIENT-LIMITED CONDITIONS. MOSS PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACTIVITY CAN BE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THE MOISTURE CONTENT OF MOSS, AND THE CARBON UPTAKE CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM VASCULAR PLANTS WITH A SIMILAR LAI. THE SOIL CARBON STOCKS DEPEND STRONGLY ON THE RATE OF INPUT OF CARBON FROM THE VEGETATION TO THE SOIL, AND OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT AN IMPROVED SIMULATION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS WOULD ALSO LEAD TO AN IMPROVED SIMULATION OF SOIL CARBON STOCKS. HOWEVER, THE STOCKS ARE ALSO INFLUENCED BY SOIL CARBON BURIAL (E.G. THROUGH CRYOTURBATION) AND THE RATE OF HETEROTROPHIC RESPIRATION, WHICH DEPENDS ON THE SOIL PHYSICAL STATE.

THE RESEARCH AIMS WERE TO (1) CLARIFY HOW THIS PLANT-MEDIATED GAS TRANSPORT INFLUENCES THE CH4 FLUXES, (2) WHICH OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES INFLUENCE THE CO2 AND CH4 FLUXES, AND (3) WHETHER PHRAGMITES PEATLANDS ARE A NET SOURCE OR SINK OF GREENHOUSE GASES. CO2 AND CH4 FLUXES WERE MEASURED WITH THE EDDY COVARIANCE TECHNIQUE WITHIN A PHRAGMITES-DOMINATED FEN IN SOUTHWEST GERMANY. ONE YEAR OF FLUX DATA (MARCH 2013-FEBRUARY 2014) SHOWS VERY CLEAR DIURNAL AND SEASONAL PATTERNS FOR BOTH CO2 AND CH4. THE DIURNAL PATTERN OF CH4 FLUXES WAS ONLY VISIBLE WHEN LIVING, GREEN REED WAS PRESENT. IN AUGUST THE DIURNAL CYCLE OF CH4 WAS THE MOST DISTINCT, WITH 11 TIMES HIGHER MIDDAY FLUXES (15.7 MG CH4 M(-2) H(-1)) THAN NIGHT FLUXES (1.41 MG CH4 M(-2) H(-1)). THIS DIURNAL CYCLE HAS THE HIGHEST CORRELATION WITH GLOBAL RADIATION, WHICH SUGGESTS A HIGH INFLUENCE OF THE PLANTS ON THE CH4 FLUX. BUT IF THE CAUSE WERE THE HIC, IT WOULD BE EXPECTED THAT RELATIVE HUMIDITY WOULD CORRELATE STRONGER WITH CH4 FLUX. THEREFORE, WE CONCLUDE THAT IN ADDITION TO HIC, AT LEAST ONE ADDITIONAL MECHANISM MUST BE INVOLVED IN THE CREATION OF THE CONVECTIVE FLOW WITHIN THE PHRAGMITES PLANTS. OVERALL, THE FEN WAS A SINK FOR CARBON AND GREENHOUSE GASES IN THE MEASURED YEAR, WITH A TOTAL CARBON UPTAKE OF 221 G CM-2 YR(-1) (26% OF THE TOTAL ASSIMILATED CARBON).

WE EXPECTED THAT NEAR THE EDGE OF THE THAW FEATURE, ACTIVELY THAWING PERMAFROST AND GREATER ABUNDANCE OF SEDGES WOULD INCREASE CARBON, OXYGEN AND NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY, ENABLING FASTER MICROBIAL RATES RELATIVE TO THE CENTER OF THE THAW FEATURE. WE DEVELOPED THREE DIFFERENT CONCEPTUAL REACTION NETWORKS THAT EXPLAINED THE TEMPORAL CHANGE IN POREWATER CO2, CH4, DELTA C-13-CO2 AND DELTA C-13-CH4. ALL THREE REACTION-NETWORK MODELS INCLUDED METHANE PRODUCTION, METHANE OXIDATION AND CO2 PRODUCTION, AND TWO OF THE MODELS INCLUDED HOMOACETOGENESIS-A REACTION NOT PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN ISOTOPE-BASED POREWATER MODELS. ALL THREE MODELS FIT THE DATA EQUALLY WELL, BUT RATES RESULTING FROM THE MODELS DIFFERED. MOST NOTABLY, INCLUSION OF HOMOACETOGENESIS ALTERED THE MODELED PATHWAYS OF METHANE PRODUCTION WHEN THE REACTION WAS DIRECTLY COUPLED TO METHANOGENESIS, AND IT DECREASED GROSS METHANE PRODUCTION RATES BY UP TO A FACTOR OF FIVE WHEN IT REMAINED DECOUPLED FROM METHANOGENESIS. THE ABILITY OF ALL THREE CONCEPTUAL REACTION NETWORKS TO SUCCESSFULLY MATCH THE MEASURED DATA INDICATE THAT THIS TECHNIQUE FOR ESTIMATING IN SITU REACTION RATES REQUIRES OTHER DATA AND INFORMATION FROM THE SITE TO CONFIRM THE CONSIDERED SET OF MICROBIAL REACTIONS. DESPITE THESE DIFFERENCES, ALL MODELS INDICATED THAT, AS EXPECTED, RATES WERE GREATER AT THE EDGE THAN IN THE CENTER OF THE THAW BOG, THAT RATES AT THE EDGE INCREASED MORE DURING THE GROWING SEASON THAN DID RATES IN THE CENTER, AND THAT THE RATIO OF ACETOCLASTIC TO HYDROGENOTROPHIC METHANOGENESIS WAS GREATER AT THE EDGE THAN IN THE CENTER.

THIS WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE SHORT NET C UPTAKE PERIOD (73 7 DAYS) AND HIGH RESPIRATION. ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION AND SUMMER GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION WERE BOTH VERY HIGH COMPARED TO OTHER PEATLANDS AROUND THE WORLD AND COMPARED TO A NEARBY LOW PRODUCTIVE GRASSLAND.

ONE SOURCE OF DOM TO GROUNDWATER IS FROM THE TRANSPORT OF ORGANIC MATTER FROM THE VADOSE ZONE BY RAINFALL RECHARGE. CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION PATTERNS ASSOCIATED WITH NATURAL CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE ARE EXPECTED TO ALTER THE LOAD AND CHARACTER OF ORGANIC MATTER RELEASED FROM THESE AREAS, WHICH ULTIMATELY IMPACTS ON GROUNDWATER QUALITY AND DOM TREATABILITY. IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN GROUNDWATER DOM CHARACTER AFTER RAINFALL RECHARGE, WE SAMPLED SHALLOW GROUNDWATER FROM A COASTAL PEAT-RICH SAND AQUIFER IN NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA, DURING AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF LOW PRECIPITATION (AVERAGE DAILY PRECIPITATION RATE < 1.6 MM DAY(-1) OVER THE 8 MONTHS PRIOR TO SAMPLING), AND AFTER TWO HEAVY PRECIPITATION EVENTS (84 MM DAY(-1) AND 98 MM DAY(-1) RESPECTIVELY).

THOSE CATEGORISED INTO THE GROUPS POLYPHENOLICS AND CONDENSED AROMATICS) WERE 1.7 AND 2.0 TIMES HIGHER RESPECTIVELY THAN IN PRE-RAINFALL SAMPLES. WE ATTRIBUTE THIS TO THE FLUSHING OF PEAT-DERIVED DOM FROM BURIED ORGANIC MATERIAL INTO THE GROUNDWATER. WE ALSO IDENTIFY THAT PERIODS OF LOW PRECIPITATION CAN LEAD TO LOW HYDROPHILIC/HOC RATIOS IN GROUNDWATER (MEDIAN = 4.9, N = 14). REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS (RDA) WAS USED TO COMPARE THE HOC FRACTION WITH FT-ICR MS COMPOUND GROUPS. WE SHOW THAT HOC HAS A MORE AROMATIC CHARACTER IN PRE-RAINFALL SAMPLES, AND IS LESS SIMILAR TO THE AROMATIC GROUPS IN POST-RAINFALL SAMPLES. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE DECLINE IN WATER-BORNE HYDROPHOBICS OBSERVED POST-RAINFALL COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH PREFERENTIAL ADSORPTION OF THE HYDROPHOBIC AROMATIC DOM, MAKING POST-RAINFALL SAMPLES LESS TREATABLE FOR POTABLE WATER SUPPLY. POST-RAINFALL WE ALSO OBSERVE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN ARSENIC (LEADING TO CONCENTRATIONS GREATER THAN 3 TIMES THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION DRINKING WATER LIMIT OF 10 MU G/ L). INCREASES IN COASTAL RAINFALL DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE MAY THEREFORE ALTER THE COMPOSITION OF GROUNDWATER DOM IN COASTAL PEATLAND AREAS IN WAYS THAT MAY IMPACT DOM BIOAVAILABILITY, AND INCREASE ARSENIC CONCENTRATIONS, REDUCING THE EASE OF WATER TREATMENT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.

A SET OF SPECIFIED CARBON CYCLE FORCINGS COULD QUALITATIVELY EXPLAIN ATMOSPHERIC CO2 DYNAMICS FROM 8 KA BP TO THE PRE-INDUSTRIAL. HOWEVER, WHEN APPLIED TO EEMIAN BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FROM 126 TO 115 KA BP, THE SAME SET OF FORCINGS LED TO DISAGREEMENT WITH THE OBSERVED DIRECTION OF CO2 CHANGES AFTER 122 KA BP. THIS FAILURE TO SIMULATE LATE-EEMIAN CO2 DYNAMICS COULD BE A RESULT OF THE IMPOSED FORCINGS SUCH AS PRESCRIBED CACO3 ACCUMULATION AND/OR AN INCORRECT RESPONSE OF SIMULATED TERRESTRIAL CARBON TO THE SURFACE COOLING AT THE END OF THE INTERGLACIAL. THESE EXPERIMENTS ALSO REVEAL THAT KEY NATURAL PROCESSES OF INTERGLACIAL CO2 DYNAMICS - SHALLOW WATER CACO3 ACCUMULATION, PEAT AND PERMAFROST CARBON DYNAMICS ARE NOT WELL REPRESENTED IN THE CURRENT ESMS. GLOBAL-SCALE MODELING OF THESE LONG-TERM CARBON CYCLE COMPONENTS STARTED ONLY IN THE LAST DECADE, AND UNCERTAINTY IN PARAMETERIZATION OF THESE MECHANISMS IS A MAIN LIMITATION IN THE SUCCESSFUL MODELING OF INTERGLACIAL CO2 DYNAMICS.

THE RELATIVELY FAST RECOVERY OF BOTH CH4 PRODUCTION AND OXIDATION IN THE PEAT LAYERS SUPPORTS EARLIER FLUX BASED RESULTS FROM THESE SAME FEN-TYPE PEATLAND SITES. IN CONTRAST TO PEAT, CH4 OXIDATION IN LIVING SPHAGNUM MOSSES APPEARED TO BE INDEPENDENT OF VEGETATION SUCCESSION AS CH4 OMDATION POTENTIAL WAS SIMILAR THROUGHOUT THE SUCCESSION STAGES. THIS INDICATED THAT SPHAGNUM MAY BE A VALUABLE CH4 BIOFILTER ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLY RE-VEGETATION STAGES WHEN THE OXIDATION IN THE PEAT HAS NOT YET RECOVERED.

IN ALL SITES, THE METHANOGENIC AND METHANOTROPHIC POPULATION SIZES WERE ENUMERATED USING QUANTITATIVE PCR (QPCR) ASSAYS TARGETING THE MCRA AND PMOA GENES, RESPECTIVELY.

THE RECOVERY IN POTENTIAL ACTIVITY WAS REFLECTED IN THE METHANOGENIC AND METHANOTROPHIC ABUNDANCES. HOWEVER, THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WAS ALTERED, BEING MORE PRONOUNCED FOR THE METHANOTROPHS. OVERALL, WE OBSERVED A LAG BETWEEN THE RECOVERY OF THE METHANOGENIC/METHANOTROPHIC ACTIVITY AND THE RETURN OF THE CORRESPONDING MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES, SUGGESTING THAT A LONGER DURATION (>15 YEARS) IS NEEDED TO REVERSE MINING-INDUCED EFFECTS ON THE METHANE-CYCLING MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL CONTROLS ON DOC CONCENTRATIONS IN A PEAT -SAND MIXTURE BY MEANS OF A SATURATED COLUMN EXPERIMENT WITH UNDISTURBED COLUMNS. THE SOIL CAME FROM A FORMER BOG IN NORTHERN GERMANY WHERE PEAT LAYERS REMAINING AFTER PEAT EXTRACTION WERE MIXED WITH THE UNDERLYING MINERAL SOIL BY PLOUGHING. THREE PUMPING RATES AND TWO LEVELS OF ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY (EC) WERE APPLIED. THE TRANSPORT PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL WERE OBTAINED BY ANALYSING BREAKTHROUGH CURVES OF POTASSIUM BROMIDE USING THE TRANSPORT MODEL STANMOD, WHICH IS BASED ON THE TWO -REGION NON -EQUILIBRIUM CONCEPT. THE RESULTS OF THE COLUMN STUDY WERE COMPARED TO DOC CONCENTRATIONS MEASURED BI-WEEKLY FOR TWO YEARS AT THE FIELD SITE FROM WHERE THE COLUMNS WERE TAKEN.

THUS EVEN HEAVILY DEGRADED ORGANIC SOILS MIXED WITH SAND STILL SHOWED A DUAL POROSITY COMPARABLE TO DEGRADED PEAT SOILS. PERCOLATING THE COLUMNS WITH THE HIGH EC SOLUTION CAUSED LOW PH VALUES, PROBABLY DUE TO ION EXCHANGE AND CATION BRIDGING. THE COMBINATION OF HIGH EC AND LOW PH GREATLY DECREASED DOC CONCENTRATIONS AT THE OUTLET OF THE COLUMNS. DOC CONCENTRATIONS DECREASED AND FLUXES INCREASED AS THE PUMPING RATES INCREASED. TAKING PORE WATER VELOCITY IN THE MOBILE ZONE INTO ACCOUNT COULD HELP TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COLUMNS. OVERALL, TRANSPORT OF DOC DID NOT SEEM TO BE LIMITED BY PRODUCTION OF DOC, BUT BY RATE -LIMITED EXCHANGE PROCESSES. IN CONTRAST TO THE COLUMN EXPERIMENT, FIELD CONCENTRATIONS OF DOC WERE MUCH HIGHER AND WERE NOT RELATED TO PH, BUT INCREASED WITH HIGHER ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY.

VASCULAR PLANTS, WHICH OFTEN DOMINATE RESTORED SITES, PLAY A KEY ROLE IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF EMITTED CH4: THE PLANTS CAN EITHER FUEL METHANOGENESIS BY SUPPLYING LABILE CARBON OR ATTENUATE METHANOGENESIS BY TRANSFERRING OXYGEN INTO THE RHIZOSPHERE.

WHILE INORGANIC ELECTRON ACCEPTOR POOLS WERE SMALL AND RAPIDLY DIMINISHED, DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER PROVIDED CONSTANT ELECTRON ACCEPTOR CAPACITY, INDICATING THAT REDUCIBLE MOIETIES IN THE ORGANIC MATTER WERE CONTINUOUSLY RE-OXIDIZED IN THE RHIZOSPHERE OF ALL TESTED VASCULAR PLANT SPECIES.

HERE WE USE N-ALKANE DISTRIBUTIONS AND STABLE CARBON ISOTOPES OF LEAF WAXES (DELTA C-13(WAX)) TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCES OF ORGANIC MATTER (OM) OF A 2000-YEAR LONG SEDIMENT/PEAT RECORD FROM LAKE PA KHO (LPK) IN NORTHEASTERN THAILAND, AND TO CONSTRAIN THE MECHANISMS THAT CAUSE SHIFTS IN DELTA C-13(WAX) AND IN DELTA C-13 OF BULK ORGANIC MATTER (DELTA C-13(BULK)). OUR RESULTS SHOW THREE MAIN SOURCES OF OM: TERRESTRIAL PLANTS, AQUATIC MACROPHYTES AND ALGAE. THE DELTA C-13 VALUES OF THE LONG CHAIN N-ALKANES, SHOW TWO DISTINCT GROUPS: C-27-C-31 AND C-33-C-35 N-ALKANES, WHERE THE DELTA C-13 VALUES OF C-33-C-35 N-ALKANES REFLECT THAT OF DELTA C-13(BULK). LOWER MOISTURE AVAILABILITY ON THE WETLAND, KNOWN FROM OTHER SEDIMENTARY EVIDENCE, WAS CHARACTERIZED BY LOW CARBON ISOTOPE VALUES TYPICALLY SEEN FOR C3 PLANTS, WHEREAS GREATER MOISTURE AVAILABILITY CORRESPONDED TO HIGHER DELTA C-13 VALUES (AROUND -20 PARTS PER THOUSAND) OF C33-C35 N-ALKANES, RESEMBLING A TYPICAL C4 PLANT SIGNAL. HOWEVER, VARIOUS LINES OF EVIDENCE ARGUE AGAINST LARGE SHIFTS BETWEEN C3 AND C4 PLANT INPUT. INSTEAD, WE SUGGEST THAT THE HIGH DELTA C-13 VALUES WERE INDIRECTLY CAUSED BY HIGHER AQUATIC PRODUCTIVITY DURING PERIODS OF GREATER MOISTURE AVAILABILITY, DECREASING DISSOLVED CO2, BUT INCREASING BICARBONATE AVAILABILITY CAUSED BY HIGHER PH. THIS CAUSED THE DOMINANT MACROPHYTES (E.G., POTAMOGETON SPP.) TO SHIFT THEIR CARBON SOURCE FROM CO2 TO BICARBONATE, WHICH HAS MUCH HIGHER DELTA C-13 VALUES.

SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN OVERCOME BY USING WHOLE GENOME AMPLIFICATION METHODS AND WHILE THESE HAVE ALLOWED INSIGHTS INTO THE IDENTITIES OF SOIL VIRUSES AND THEIR GENOMES, THEIR INHERIT BIASES HAVE PREVENTED MEANINGFUL ECOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONS. HERE WE EXPERIMENTALLY OPTIMIZED STEPS FOR GENERATING QUANTITATIVELY-AMPLIFIED VIRAL METAGENOMES TO BETTER CAPTURE BOTH SSDNA AND DSDNA VIRUSES ACROSS THREE DISTINCT SOIL HABITATS ALONG A PERMAFROST THAW GRADIENT. FIRST, WE ASSESSED DIFFERING DNA EXTRACTION METHODS (POWERSOIL, WIZARD MINI COLUMNS, AND CETYL TRIMETHYLAMMONIUM BROMIDE) FOR QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF VIRAL DNA. THIS ESTABLISHED POWERSOIL AS BEST FOR YIELD AND QUALITY OF DNA FROM OUR SAMPLES, THOUGH SIMILAR TO 1/3 OF THE VIRAL POPULATIONS CAPTURED BY EACH EXTRACTION KIT WERE UNIQUE, SUGGESTING APPRECIABLE DIFFERENTIAL BIASES AMONG DNA EXTRACTION KITS.

DNA YIELDS AFTER CSCL PARTICLE-PURIFICATION WERE LARGELY NON-DETECTABLE, WHILE UNPURIFIED SAMPLES YIELDED 1-2-FOLD MORE DNA AFTER LYSIS BY HEAT THAN BY BEAD-BEATING. VIROME QUALITY WAS ASSESSED BY THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF METAGENOME-ASSEMBLED VIRAL CONTIGS, WHICH SHOWED NO INCREASE AFTER CSCI-PURIFICATION, BUT DID FROM HEAT LYSIS RELATIVE TO BEAD-BEATING.

THIS PAPER DEMONSTRATES AN APPLICATION OF THE LAND USE AND CARBON SCENARIO SIMULATOR (LUCAS) MODEL DEVELOPED FOR LOCAL-SCALE LAND MANAGEMENT AT THE GREAT DISMAL SWAMP NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE. WE ESTIMATE THE NET ECOSYSTEM CARBON BALANCE BY CONSIDERING PAST ECOSYSTEM DISTURBANCES RESULTING FROM STORM DAMAGE, FIRE, AND LAND MANAGEMENT ACTIONS INCLUDING HYDROLOGIC INUNDATION, VEGETATION CLEARING, AND REPLANTING. RESULTS: WE MODELED THE ANNUAL ECOSYSTEM CARBON STOCK AND FLOW RATES FOR THE 30-YEAR HISTORIC TIME PERIOD OF 1985-2015, USING AGE-STRUCTURED FOREST GROWTH CURVES AND KNOWN DATA FOR DISTURBANCE EVENTS AND MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. THE 30-YEAR TOTAL NET ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTION WAS ESTIMATED TO BE A NET SINK OF 0.97 TG C. WHEN A HURRICANE AND SIX HISTORIC FIRE EVENTS WERE CONSIDERED IN THE SIMULATION, THE GREAT DISMAL SWAMP BECAME A NET SOURCE OF 0.89 TG C. THE CUMULATIVE ABOVE AND BELOW-GROUND CARBON LOSS ESTIMATED FROM THE SOUTH ONE AND LATERAL WEST FIRE EVENTS TOTALED 1.70 TG C, WHILE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES REMOVED AN ADDITIONAL 0.01 TG C. THE CARBON LOSS IN BELOW-GROUND BIOMASS ALONE TOTALED 1.38 TG C, WITH THE BALANCE (0.31 TG C) COMING FROM ABOVE-GROUND BIOMASS AND DETRITUS. CONCLUSIONS: NATURAL DISTURBANCES SUBSTANTIALLY IMPACT NET ECOSYSTEM CARBON BALANCE IN THE GREAT DISMAL SWAMP. THROUGH ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT ACTIONS SUCH AS RE-WETTING, BELOW-GROUND BIOMASS LOSS MAY HAVE BEEN AVOIDED, RESULTING IN THE ADDED CARBON STORAGE CAPACITY OF 1.38 TG.

WE MEASURED THE C-14 OF BOTH DOC AND CO2 AT SEVEN TIME POINTS AND FOUND THAT WHILE DOC REMAINED CLOSE TO MODERN IN AGE, THE RESULTANT CO2 PROGRESSIVELY INCREASED IN AGE UP TO 2,356767YEARS BP. THE RESULTS OF THIS EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATE THAT THE BULK (DOC)-C-14 POOL CAN HIDE THE PRESENCE OF OLD C WITHIN PEATLAND STREAM DOC EXPORT, DEMONSTRATING THAT BULK (DOC)-C-14 MEASUREMENTS CAN BE AN INSENSITIVE INDICATOR OF PEATLAND DISTURBANCE.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY THE INTRODUCTION OF OLD CARBON PREVIOUSLY STORED IN SOILS FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS INTO RIVERS CAN INCREASE THE NET FLUX OF GREENHOUSE GASES TO THE ATMOSPHERE, IMPACTING GLOBAL CLIMATE. THIS IS BECAUSE RIVERS TRANSPORT THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE THIRD OF HUMAN CARBON EMISSIONS ANNUALLY FROM LAND TO THE OCEANS. MUCH RIVER-BORNE CARBON IS PLANT AND SOIL (ORGANIC) MATTER THAT CAN DECOMPOSE DURING TRANSPORT, RELEASING GREENHOUSE GASES TO THE ATMOSPHERE. RADIOCARBON DATING CAN REVEAL THE AGE OF RIVER-BORNE CARBON, BUT PREVIOUS MEASUREMENTS MAY HAVE UNDERESTIMATED THE AGE OF CARBON RELEASED INTO RIVERS BY NOT CONSIDERING THE POTENTIAL FOR OLD CARBON HIDDEN WITHIN INDIVIDUAL BULK WATER SAMPLES. USING AN INCUBATION EXPERIMENT, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON FROM A SCOTTISH PEATLAND STREAM THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED MODERN IN AGE USING TRADITIONAL BULK RADIOCARBON DATING CAN READILY DECOMPOSE TO PRODUCE CARBON DIOXIDE WITH AN OLD RADIOCARBON SIGNATURE UP TO SIMILAR TO 2,500YEARS OLD. THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT RADIOCARBON DATING OF BULK RIVERINE DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON CAN HIDE THE PRESENCE OF OLD CARBON.

IN OUR EXPERIMENTS, THE ORGANISMS THAT BENEFITTED MOST AFTER ADDITION OF LABILE DOC WERE MIXOTROPHIC ALGAE, WHICH CAN TRANSFORM CARBON INTO BIOMASS BY OBTAINING INORGANIC NUTRIENTS THROUGH PHAGOTROPHY.

OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT DESPITE ONGOING DEFORESTATION, CO2 EMISSIONS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASED DURING THE 2000S, LARGELY OWING TO MILDER CLIMATE THAT RESTORES PHOTOSYNTHETIC CAPACITY AND SUPPRESSES PEAT AND DEFORESTATION FIRE EMISSIONS.

IN CLEAR-CUTTING, STEM WOOD IS REMOVED AND THE LOGGING RESIDUES ARE EITHER REMOVED OR LEFT ON SITE. CLEAR-CUTTING CHANGES THE MICROCLIMATE AND VEGETATION STRUCTURE AT THE SITE, BOTH OF WHICH AFFECT THE SITE'S CARBON BALANCE. PEAT SOILS WITH POOR AERATION AND HIGH CARBON DENSITIES ARE ESPECIALLY PRONE TO SUCH CHANGES, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN GREENHOUSE GAS EXCHANGE CAN BE EXPECTED. WE MEASURED CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) AND ENERGY FLUXES WITH THE EDDY COVARIANCE METHOD FOR 2 YEARS (APRIL 2016-MARCH 2018) AFTER CLEAR-CUTTING A DRAINED PEATLAND FOREST. WE OBSERVED A SIGNIFICANT RISE (23 CM) IN THE WATER TABLE LEVEL AND A LARGE CO2 SOURCE (FIRST YEAR: 3086 +/- 148 G CO2 M(-2) YR(-1); SECOND YEAR: 2072 +/- 124 G CO2 M(-2) YR(-1)). THESE LARGE CO2 EMISSIONS RESULTED FROM THE VERY LOW GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION (GPP) FOLLOWING THE REMOVAL OF PHOTOSYNTHESIZING TREES AND THE DECLINE OF GROUND VEGETATION, UNABLE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE DECOMPOSITION OF LOGGING RESIDUES AND PEAT. DURING THE SECOND SUMMER (JUNE-AUGUST) AFTER THE CLEAR-CUTTING, GPP HAD ALREADY INCREASED BY 96% AND TOTAL ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION DECREASED BY 14% FROM THE PREVIOUS SUMMER.

IN APRIL-SEPTEMBER, THE MEAN DAYTIME SENSIBLE HEAT FLUX WAS 33% LOWER AND LATENT HEAT FLUX 40% HIGHER IN 2017, PROBABLY DUE TO THE RECOVERY OF GROUND VEGETATION THAT INCREASED EVAPOTRANSPIRATION AND ALBEDO OF THE SITE.

ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OF ECO-HYDROLOGY MODEL IS TO INCORPORATE A COMPLEX RELATION BETWEEN SOIL, WATER, TEMPERATURE, PLANT, AND CARBON. IN THIS PAPER, THE AUTHOR REVIEWED PREVIOUS PROGRESS IN ECO-HYDROLOGY MODEL FOCUSING ON SURFACE-GROUNDWATER CONNECTIVITY AND HYDROLOGIC-GEOMORPHIC-ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES INTERACTION. HE ALSO REVIEWED THE RECENT PROGRESS IN MODELING, THE ROLE OF INLAND WATER ON BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLE BY COMPILING VARIOUS DATASETS OF HYDROLOGICAL AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLE. THEN, HE SHOWED A NEW ADVANCED MODEL COUPLING ECO-HYDROLOGY AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLE (NICE-BGC). THE MODEL RESULTS OF BOTH CO2 EVASION AND CARBON TRANSPORT TO THE OCEAN WERE REASONABLY IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH PREVIOUS DATA. IN ORDER TO DECREASE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT CARBON CYCLE, IT BECAME CLEAR THE PREVIOUS EMPIRICAL ESTIMATION SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO THIS PROCESS-ORIENTED MODEL AND HIGHER RESOLUTION DATA TO FURTHER CLARIFY MECHANISTIC INTERPLAY BETWEEN INORGANIC AND ORGANIC CARBON AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS IN TERRESTRIAL-AQUATIC LINKAGES. NICE-BGC WOULD PLAY IMPORTANT ROLE IN RE-EVALUATION OF GREENHOUSE GAS BUDGET OF THE BIOSPHERE, QUANTIFICATION OF HOT SPOTS, AND BRIDGING GAP BETWEEN TOP-DOWN AND BOTTOM-UP APPROACHES IN GLOBAL CARBON BUDGET.

FEW STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED CH4 FLUXES IN SUBARCTIC HEATH ECOSYSTEMS, AND CLIMATE CHANGE-INDUCED SHIFTS IN CH4 FLUX AND THE OVERALL CARBON BUDGET ARE THEREFORE LARGELY UNKNOWN. HENCE, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR LONG-TERM IN SITU EXPERIMENTS ALLOWING FOR THE STUDY OF ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES OVER TIME SCALES RELEVANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. HERE WE PRESENT IN SITU CH4 AND CO2 FLUX MEASUREMENTS FROM A WET HEATH ECOSYSTEM IN NORTHERN SWEDEN SUBJECTED TO 16 YEARS OF MANIPULATIONS, INCLUDING SUMMER WARMING WITH OPEN-TOP CHAMBERS, BIRCH LEAF LITTER ADDITION, AND THE COMBINATION THEREOF. THROUGHOUT THE SNOW-FREE SEASON, THE ECOSYSTEM WAS A NET SINK OF CH4 AND CO2 (CH4 -0.27 MG C M(-2) D(-1); NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE -1827 MG C M(-2) D(-1)), WITH HIGHEST CH4 UPTAKE RATES (-0.70 MG C M(-2) D(-1)) DURING FALL. WARMING ENHANCED NET CO2 FLUX, WHILE NET CH4 FLUX WAS GOVERNED BY SOIL MOISTURE. LITTER ADDITION AND THE COMBINATION WITH WARMING SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED CH4 UPTAKE RATES, EXPLAINED BY A PRONOUNCED SOIL DRYING EFFECT OF UP TO 32% RELATIVE TO AMBIENT CONDITIONS. BOTH WARMING AND LITTER ADDITION ALSO INCREASED THE SEASONAL AVERAGE CONCENTRATION OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON IN THE SOIL. THE SITE WAS A CARBON SINK WITH A NET UPTAKE OF 60 G CM-2 OVER THE SNOW-FREE SEASON. HOWEVER, WARMING REDUCED NET CARBON UPTAKE BY 77%, SUGGESTING THAT THIS ECOSYSTEM TYPE MIGHT SHIFT FROM SNOW-FREE SEASON SINK TO SOURCE WITH INCREASING SUMMER TEMPERATURES. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: MUCH ATTENTION HAS BEEN DIRECTED TOWARD METHANE (CH4) DYNAMICS IN PEATLANDS AND WET ECOSYSTEMS AT HIGH LATITUDES, WHICH ARE CONSIDERED NET CH4 SOURCES WHICH INTENSIFY THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT AND LEAD TO FURTHER WARMING. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE HITHERTO INVESTIGATED CH4 FLUXES IN SUBARCTIC HEATH ECOSYSTEMS, WHICH LIKELY EXHIBIT BOTH CH4 PRODUCTION AND UPTAKE. THEREFORE, CLIMATE-INDUCED CHANGES IN CH4 EXCHANGE AND THE OVERALL CARBON BALANCE ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN. IN THIS UNIQUE LONG-TERM FIELD EXPERIMENT, WE INVESTIGATED THE RESPONSE OF BIOLOGICAL CH4 UPTAKE (MICROBIAL CH4 CONSUMPTION) TO INCREASED SUMMER WARMING BY OPEN-TOP CHAMBERS AND DECIDUOUS LEAF LITTER INPUT IN A WET HEATH ECOSYSTEM IN NORTHERN SWEDEN, REPRESENTATIVE OF A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE TUNDRA LANDSCAPE. WE FOUND THAT LEAF LITTER ADDITION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES CH4 UPTAKE RATES DUE TO A PRONOUNCED SOIL DRYING EFFECT, WHICH IS INTENSIFIED IN COMBINATION WITH WARMING. WARMING ENHANCES CO2 RELEASE, WHILE CH4 UPTAKE IS CONTROLLED BY SOIL MOISTURE. THE STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE SENSITIVITY AND CAPACITY OF A WET HEATH ECOSYSTEM TO FUNCTION AS A NET CH4 SINK. HOWEVER, IT WAS ALSO SHOWN THAT HIGHER SUMMER TEMPERATURES MIGHT SHIFT THE ECOSYSTEM TOWARD A NET CARBON SOURCE DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CO2 RELEASE, THEREBY ENHANCING THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT.","SEASONAL VARIATIONS IN METHANE FLUXES IN RESPONSE TO SUMMER WARMING AND LEAF LITTER ADDITION IN A SUBARCTIC HEATH ECOSYSTEM","JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES","ARTICLE","AUG",2017,"10.1002/2017JG003782","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000410174100016"

A SEMI-UNIFORM SPATIAL SAMPLING APPROACH WAS UTILIZED TO DESCRIBE THE SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES, PORE-WATER CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICAL CONDITION OF 100 PLOTS THROUGHOUT A SINGLE PEATLAND COMPLEX. REGARDLESS OF SHARING THE SAME GROUND COVER OF SPHAGNUM MOSSES, THE REMAINING SPECIES SEPARATED INTO FOUR DISTINCT ASSEMBLAGES, EACH WITH UNIQUE INDICATORS. THESE SPECIES GROUPS ALONG WITH ASSOCIATED CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL FACTORS ARE ORGANIZED INTO FOUR ECOSITES: BOG, MARGIN (EDGE) AND TWO POOR FEN ECOSITES. THE PLANT ASSEMBLAGES OF THIS PEATLAND HAVE A COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP WITH NUMEROUS GRADIENTS, BOTH PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL, INCLUDING DEPTH TO WATER TABLE, SHADE, PH, NUTRIENT AND BASE CATION. RATHER THAN BEING HOMOGENOUS ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE, MOST ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES EXHIBIT DISTINCT SPATIAL PATTERNS AND DO SO IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE PLANT ASSEMBLAGES, FORMING SPATIALLY DISTINCT ECOSITES ACROSS THE COMPLEX. BASE CATION CONCENTRATIONS PLAY A SMALLER ROLE THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT IN DIFFERENTIATING THESE ECOSITES, AND IN ADDITION TO SHADE AND DEPTH TO WATER TABLE, NITROGEN IN THE FORM OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC NITROGEN WAS HIGHLY RELATED TO THE PLACEMENT OF THESE ECOSITES. MANY SIGNIFICANT CHEMICAL FACTORS APPEAR RELATED TO EVAPORATIVE WATER LOSS WITHIN THE PEATLAND COMPLEX, AND THESE CHEMICAL FACTORS ARE USED TO DIFFERENTIATE THE ECOSITES. HOWEVER, THE MEDIATION OF EVAPORATIVE WATER LOSS IS DUE LARGELY TO SELF-GENERATED RESPONSES OF THE PLANT ASSEMBLAGES RELATED TO SHADE THROUGH PLANT MORPHOLOGY AND PEAT ACROTELM DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO DEPTH TO WATER TABLE.

ON EACH PEATLAND TYPE, WE INCLUDED AN ADJACENT FORESTRY DRAINED (FD, WITH WATER TABLE CA. 40 CM LOWER THAN IN CONTROL) AREA FOR COMPARISON. RESULTS PEATLAND TYPE HAD A CLEAR IMPACT ON THE RESPONSE TO WLD: AT THE ECOSYSTEM LEVEL, THE TWO MINEROTROPHIC FENS UNDERWENT RAPID SPECIES TURNOVER, WHILE THE VEGETATION IN NUTRIENT-POOR BOG WAS MORE RESILIENT TO CHANGE. IN NUTRIENT-RICH SITES, WLD INITIATED TREE CANOPY DEVELOPMENT AND CREATED UNDERSTOREY CONDITIONS THAT STRENGTHENED IMPACT OF WLD.

MAPPING DRAINS IS DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE AND THEIR SPATIAL EXTENT IS, IN MANY CASES, UNKNOWN. AN OBJECT BASED IMAGE ANALYSIS (OBIA) WAS PERFORMED ON A VERY HIGH RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGE (GEOEYE-1) TO EXTRACT INFORMATION ABOUT DRAIN LOCATION AND EXTENT ON A BLANKET PEATLAND IN IRELAND. TWO ACCURACY ASSESSMENT METHODS: ERROR MATRIX AND THE COMPLETENESS, CORRECTNESS AND QUALITY (CCQ) WERE USED TO ASSESS THE EXTRACTED DATA ACROSS THE PEATLAND AND AT SEVERAL SUB SITES. THE COST OF THE OBIA METHOD WAS COMPARED WITH MANUAL DIGITISATION AND FIELD SURVEY. THE DRAIN MAPS WERE ALSO USED TO ASSESS THE COSTS RELATING TO BLOCKING DRAINS VS. A BUSINESS-AS-USUAL SCENARIO AND ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF EACH ON CARBON FLUXES AT THE STUDY SITE. RESULTS: THE OBIA METHOD PERFORMED WELL AT ALMOST ALL SITES. ALMOST 500 KM OF DRAINS WERE DETECTED WITHIN THE PEATLAND. IN THE ERROR MATRIX METHOD, OVERALL ACCURACY (OA) OF DETECTING THE DRAINS WAS 94% AND THE KAPPA STATISTIC WAS 0.66. THE OA FOR ALL SUB-AREAS, EXCEPT ONE, WAS 95-97%. THE CCQ WAS 85%, 85% AND 71% RESPECTIVELY.

THE EXTRACTED DRAIN MAPS WERE USED CONSTRAIN THE STUDY AREA CO(2 )FLUX WHICH WAS 19% SMALLER THAN THE PRESCRIBED PEATLAND CODE VALUE FOR DRAINED PEATLANDS. CONCLUSIONS: THE OBIA METHOD USED IN THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACCURATELY EXTRACT MAPS OF FINE SCALE PEATLAND DRAINS OVER LARGE AREAS IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER. THE DEVELOPMENT OF METHODS TO MAP THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF DRAINS IS IMPORTANT AS THEY PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN PEATLAND CARBON DYNAMICS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXTRACT DATA ON THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF DRAINS ON A BLANKET BOG IN THE WEST OF IRELAND. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT INFORMATION ON DRAIN EXTENT AND LOCATION CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGERY AND MAPPED WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURACY.

BROADLY AVAILABLE BIODEGRADABLE MATERIALS SUCH AS HUMUS, CATTLE MANURE, PEAT MOSS, AND SAWDUST ARE EVALUATED AS SOLID ANOLYTES. THE INITIAL COMPARISON SHOWS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER POWER PRODUCTION IN THE SAMFC OPERATED USING HUMUS AS COMPARED TO OTHER SOLID ANOLYTES. AT THE SAME TIME, POWER PRODUCTION IN THE HUMUS-BASED SAMFC IS FOUND TO DECLINE AFTER ABOUT 40 DAYS OF OPERATION, WHILE THE SAWDUST MFC DEMONSTRATES STABLE PERFORMANCE OVER THE TEST PERIOD. FOLLOWING THIS INITIAL COMPARISON, A COMBINED HUMUS - SAWDUST ANOLYTE IS DEVELOPED TO INCREASE SAMFC LIFE SPAN. THE OPTIMIZED SAMFC DEMONSTRATES STABLE POWER PRODUCTION FOR OVER NINE MONTHS. FURTHERMORE, POWER PRODUCTION IN THE SAMFC IS MAXIMIZED BY USING AN INTERMITTENT CONNECTION TO AN ELECTRICAL LOAD (ON/OFF OPERATION) AND OPTIMIZING THE CONNECTION/DISCONNECTION TIMES.

WE ASKED WHAT ARE THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF SUBMERGENCE DURATION ON FOUR COMMON BOREAL FEN MOSS SPECIES AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR ECOSYSTEM RESILIENCE? LOCATION: RICH FEN NEAR FORT MCMURRAY, ALBERTA, CANADA. METHODS: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SUBMERGENCE DURATION ON FEN MOSS SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES, WE HARVESTED AND SUBMERGED MONOCULTURE PLUGS DOMINATED BY HAMATOCAULIS VERNICOSUS, SPHAGNUM WARNSTORFII, TOMENTYPNUM NITENS AND AULACOMNIUM PALUSTRE IN THE FIELD UNDER RICH FEN WATER FOR 1-8 WEEKS. AFTER SUBMERGENCE, WE PLANTED THE PLUGS IN BARE PEAT AT THE SAME SITE TO EVALUATE THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM RESPONSES OF EACH SPECIES AND CHANGES IN MOSS COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OVER TIME. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT MOSS SPECIES RESPONSE TO DURATION OF SUBMERGENCE IS NOT STRICTLY RELATED TO THEIR OCCURRENCE ALONG A HUMMOCK-HOLLOW GRADIENT AND THAT TOLERANT SPECIES MAINTAIN OR RESTORE MOSS COVER.

WE CONDUCTED A FIELD IN SITU DRAINAGE EXPERIMENT CONSISTING OF LOW (PLOTS SURROUNDED BY 50 CM DEEP DITCHES), INTERMEDIATE (20 CM DEEP) AND HIGH (INTACT) WATER TABLE LEVELS. THE EXPERIMENT LASTED FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS, DURING WHICH WE MEASURED SCE RATE AND ASSOCIATED VARIABLES INCLUDING SOIL TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE WITH A HIGHER FREQUENCY IN THE GROWING SEASON (MAY-SEPTEMBER) THAN THE NON-GROWING SEASON (OCTOBER-APRIL). EXPERIMENTAL DRAINAGE DECREASED WATER TABLE HEIGHT BY CA. 12 CM AND 15 CM (RELATIVE TO THE INTACT) AND SOIL MOISTURE (AT 5 CM SOIL) BY 6% AND 12% (RELATIVE TO 45% IN THE INTACT) ON AVERAGE IN INTERMEDIATE AND LOW WATER TABLE TREATMENTS, RESPECTIVELY, BUT IT DID NOT AFFECT SOIL TEMPERATURE DURING THE EXPERIMENTAL YEARS. THE EFFECT OF DRAINAGE ON SCE VARIED WITH SEASON. IN THE NON-GROWING SEASON, THE DRAINAGE EFFECT WAS NONSIGNIFICANT IN EACH MEASUREMENT POSSIBLY BECAUSE THE LOW-TEMPERATURE EFFECT OVERRODE THE DRAINAGE EFFECT ON SCE. IN THE GROWING SEASON, THE DRAINAGE MOSTLY INCREASED THE EMISSION EXCEPT FOR SEVERAL CASES, IN WHICH A NEGATIVE EFFECT WAS OBSERVED. THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF DRAINAGE COULD BE DUE TO THE LOW SOIL MOISTURE (< 25%) IN THE DRAINED TREATMENTS.

AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, REWETTING AND MORE SENSIBLE USES OF PEAT SOILS FOR AGRICULTURE ARE INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED AS EFFECTIVE POTENTIAL OPTIONS TO MITIGATE GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS ESTIMATES OF THE GHG MITIGATION POTENTIAL AND ABATEMENT COSTS OF DIFFERENT PEATLAND MANAGEMENT OPTIONS BY USING THE EXAMPLE OF FARM MODELS THAT REPRESENT TYPICAL FARM TYPES IN AN INTENSIVE GRASSLAND-USE PEATLAND REGION IN SOUTHERN GERMANY. THEREFORE, AN OPTIMIZATION MODEL AT THE FARM LEVEL THAT INCLUDES THE EMISSIONS FROM ALL RELEVANT SOURCES IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS IS USED. THE CURRENT NET GHG EMISSIONS OF THE FARM MODELS RANGE FROM 10 TO 12.9 TCO(2)E HA(-1) A(-1), OF WHICH THE PEAT SOIL BORNE EMISSIONS MAKE UP A NOTICEABLE SHARE. THE REWETTING AND CONVERSION OF MEDIUM-DRAINED GRASSLAND INTO WET GRASSLAND LEAD TO CONSIDERABLE REDUCTIONS OF GHG EMISSIONS. HOWEVER, IN INTENSIVELY MANAGED DAIRY FARMS, THE FULL EMISSION MITIGATION POTENTIAL OF THESE PEATLAND MANAGEMENT OPTIONS IS NOT REALIZED, BECAUSE NECESSARY ADAPTATIONS INCREASE EMISSIONS FROM OTHER SOURCES. BECAUSE OF ITS LOW GHG MITIGATION POTENTIAL, THE CONVERSION OF ARABLE LAND INTO MEDIUM DRAINED INTENSIVE GRASSLAND LEADS TO HIGH ABATEMENT COSTS OF UP TO 92(SIC)/TCO(2)E, WHILE THE ABATEMENT COSTS OF THE REWETTING AND CONVERSION INTO WET GRASSLAND RANGE FROM 5 TO 57(SIC)/TCO(2)E.

THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE POTENTIAL IMPORTANCE OF SUCH PROCESSES IN SEVERAL PEATLANDS THAT SPAN A GRADIENT FROM HEMIBOREAL TO TROPICAL ECOZONES AND EXPERIENCE A WIDE RANGE OF FIRE RETURN INTERVALS.

USING X-RAY PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY AND FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT LOW-SEVERITY FIRES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE DEGREE OF CARBON CONDENSATION AND AROMATIZATION OF SOM FUNCTIONAL GROUPS, PARTICULARLY ON THE SURFACE OF PEAT AGGREGATES.

HYDROLOGICAL RESTORATION WAS FOUND TO IMPACT THE WATER BALANCE THROUGH A DECREASE IN SLOW DEEP DRAINAGE AND AN INCREASE IN FAST SUPERFICIAL RUNOFF. OBSERVED DOC CONCENTRATIONS WERE HIGHER IN SUMMER IN THE REWETTED LOCATION COMPARED TO THE CONTROL AREA AND WERE LINKED TO A DIFFERENCE IN DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER COMPOSITION ANALYZED BY FLUORESCENCE. HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS, ESPECIALLY THE SEVERITY OF THE WATER-TABLE DRAWDOWN IN SUMMER, WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE MAJOR FACTOR CONTROLLING DOC-CONCENTRATION DYNAMICS. THE RESULTS OF THE SIMULATION SUGGEST THAT THE HYDROLOGICAL RESTORATION DID NOT AFFECT DOC LOADS, AT LEAST IN A SHORT-TERM PERIOD (3 YEARS). HOWEVER, IT IMPACTED THE TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF DOC EXPORTS, WHICH WERE THE MOST EPISODIC AND WERE MAINLY TRANSPORTED THROUGH FAST SURFACE RUNOFF IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE RESTORATION, WHILE SLOW DEEP DRAINAGE DOMINATED DOC EXPORTS IN THE CONTROL AREA.

THE 6180 VALUES OF BULK COAL ARE STRONGLY CORRELATED TO THE COAL DRY ASH YIELDS AND APPEAR TO HAVE LITTLE OR NO INFLUENCE ON THE DELTA O-18 VALUES OF CO2 RESULTING FROM COAL COMBUSTION IN OPEN ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS.

GRAZING DIMINISHES ABOVEGROUND CARBON, CREATING A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THESE TWO SERVICES. FURTHERMORE, SALTMARSHES ARE THREATENED BY OVERGRAZING. TO PROVIDE SALTMARSH PROTECTION AND ENSURE THE CONTINUING DELIVERY OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, THERE IS A NEED TO INCENTIVISE LAND MANAGERS TO STOCK ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSIBLE DENSITIES. WE THEREFORE INVESTIGATED THE POSSIBILITY OF AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL SCHEMES AND PAYMENTS FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES (PES) TO COMPENSATE FOR LOST LIVESTOCK REVENUE UNDER REDUCED GRAZING REGIMES AND PROVIDE CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND OTHER BENEFITS. THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO CONSIDER THE BENEFITS ARISING FROM A POTENTIAL CARBON MARKET TO SALTMARSHES, ALTHOUGH SIMILAR SCHEMES EXIST FOR PEATLAND AND WOODLAND. WE CALCULATED THE NET ECONOMIC BENEFIT (COSTS OF LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION ARE REMOVED FROM REVENUE) TO FARMERS OBTAINED FROM A HECTARE OF GRAZED SALTMARSH UNDER LOW (0.3 LIVESTOCK UNITS PER HECTARE PER YEAR), MODERATE (0.6), HIGH (1.0) AND VERY HIGH (2.0) STOCKING DENSITIES ACCOUNTING FOR LIVESTOCK REVENUE, CARBON BENEFITS, AND AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL SUBSIDIES. WE REPEATED THE PROCEDURE CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL BENEFITS TRANSFERRED FROM THE LITERATURE IN TERMS OF PROVISIONING, REGULATING AND CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES PROVIDED BY PROTECTED SALTMARSHES. THE NET BENEFITS WERE ASSESSED FOR A RANGE OF MARKET CARBON PRICES AND SOCIAL COSTS OF CARBON, E.G. THE OPPORTUNITY COST OF CARBON FOR SOCIETY. APPLYING THE MODEL TO SCOTTISH SALTMARSHES WE FIND THAT THE CURRENT RANGE OF MARKET PRICES COULD PROMPT TRANSITIONS FROM HIGH TO MODERATE REGIMES IN AREAS WHERE LIVESTOCK VALUE IS LOW, HOWEVER BREAK-EVEN PRICES FOR TRANSITIONS SHOWED HIGH SPATIAL VARIABILITY DUE TO SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN LIVESTOCK VALUES. IN SOME AREAS OF THE WEST HIGHLANDS, THE BREAK-EVEN CARBON PRICE IS NEGATIVE, INDICATING THAT THE CURRENT AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL SCHEMES ARE ABLE TO MORE THAN COMPENSATE FOR THE LOST REVENUE ACCRUING TO FARMERS BY A REDUCED GRAZING DENSITY. HOWEVER, IN OTHER AREAS, SUCH AS THE OUTER HEBRIDES, THE BREAKEVEN CARBON PRICE IS POSITIVE. PRIVATE PES SCHEMES OR INCREASED PUBLIC SUBSIDIES SHOULD THEN BE PROVIDED TO GENERATE NET BENEFITS. IT IS REASONABLE TO INFER THAT A PURE CARBON MARKET MAY HAVE LIMITED SCOPE IN INCENTIVISING CONSUMERS TO BUY CARBON SERVICES, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WITH LIMITED LOCAL NUMBER OF BUYERS AND CORPORATES OF SMALL SIZE. UNDER THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, A PREMIUM CARBON MARKET OFFERING BUNDLED ECOSYSTEM SERVICES MAY HELP REDUCE GRAZING PRESSURE ACROSS A LARGER NUMBER OF SCOTTISH SALTMARSHES, THEREBY PROVIDING GLOBALLY IMPORTANT CLIMATE REGULATION SERVICES AND AT THE SAME TIME PROTECTING SENSITIVE HABITATS.","ASSESSING THE FEASIBILITY OF CARBON PAYMENTS AND PAYMENTS FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES TO REDUCE LIVESTOCK GRAZING PRESSURE ON SALTMARSHES","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT","ARTICLE","NOV 1",2018,"10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.07.060","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000445988400006"

IN THIS STUDY, THE FLOODPLAIN SEDIMENT AND SOIL ORGANIC CARBON STORAGE IS QUANTIFIED FOR THE MOUNTAINOUS HEADWATERS OF THE RIVER DEE IN EASTERN SCOTLAND (663 KM(2)), BASED ON A CORING DATASET OF 78 FLOODPLAIN CROSS-SECTIONS. WHEREAS THE MINERAL SEDIMENT STORAGE IS DOMINATED BY WANDERING GRAVEL-BED RIVER SECTIONS, MOST OF THE SOIL ORGANIC CARBON STORAGE CAN BE FOUND IN ANASTOMOSING AND MEANDERING SECTIONS. THE TOTAL STORAGE FOR THE UPPER DEE CATCHMENT CAN BE ESTIMATED AT 5.2 MT OR 2306.5 MG HA(-1) OF MINERAL SEDIMENT AND 0.7 MT OR 323.3 MG C HA(-1) OF SOIL ORGANIC CARBON, WHICH IS IN LINE WITH OTHER STUDIES ON TEMPERATE RIVER SYSTEMS.

THE DATA SETS DEFINING PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF PEAT IN THE SOIL WERE OBTAINED FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES AND DIFFERENT SAMPLING SCHEMES, DENSITIES AND DISTRIBUTIONS. SCOTLAND WAS USED AS TEST CASE, BECAUSE OF ITS CLOUDY WEATHER AND FRAGMENTED DISTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEAT. AN EXTENSION OF THE SCORPAN-KRIGING APPROACH WAS USED. THE TREND WAS ESTIMATED WITH DIFFERENT APPROACHES: GENERALIZED ADDITIVE MODELS, RANDOMFOREST AND DEEP LEARNING (CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS). EACH APPROACH PRODUCED THE PROBABILITY OF BELONGING TO A CLASS AND THE PREDICTED CLASS FOR EACH PIXEL. THE RESULTS WERE ASSESSED USING OUT-OF-SAMPLE MEASURES. IN THIS STUDY 108 COMBINATIONS OF DATA SETS AND MODELS (INCLUDING TREND APPROACHES, SETS OF COVARIATES AND MODELLING OF THE SPATIAL STRUCTURE) WERE ASSESSED. OVERALL, SPATIALLY EXPLICIT MODELS PERFORMED BETTER. THE CHOICE OF THE STATISTICAL METHOD CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCES, WHILE THE SETS OF ENVIRONMENTAL COVARIATES HAD A LOWER IMPACT.

SBC CONCENTRATIONS IN THE CONTEMPORARY SHELF SEDIMENTS RANGE FROM 0.1 TO 2.1 MG G(-1) DW, CORRESPONDING TO 2-12% OF TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON.

THE TOTAL BURIAL FLUX OF SBC IN THE ESAS (SIMILAR TO 4,000 GG YR(-1)) ILLUSTRATES THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF THIS ARCTIC SHELF IN MARINE SEQUESTRATION OF SBC.

IN THIS STUDY, WE COMPILED TERRESTRIAL AND AQUATIC FLUXES OF CO2, CH4, DOC, DIC, AND HARVESTED C OBTAINED FROM TALL-TOWER EDDY COVARIANCE MEASUREMENTS, STREAM MONITORING, AND REMOTE SENSING OF BIOMASS STOCKS FOR AN ENTIRE BOREAL CATCHMENT (68 KM(2)) IN SWEDEN TO ESTIMATE THE NLCB ACROSS THE LAND-WATER-ATMOSPHERE CONTINUUM. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT THIS MANAGED BOREAL FOREST LANDSCAPE WAS A NET C SINK (NLCB = 39 G C M(-2) YEAR(-1)) WITH THE LANDSCAPE-ATMOSPHERE CO2 EXCHANGE BEING THE DOMINANT COMPONENT, FOLLOWED BY THE C EXPORT VIA HARVEST AND STREAMS. ACCOUNTING FOR THE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL OF CH4, THE LANDSCAPE WAS A GHG SINK OF 237 G CO2-EQ M(-2) YEAR(-1), THUS PROVIDING A CLIMATE-COOLING EFFECT. THE CH4 FLUX CONTRIBUTION TO THE ANNUAL GHG BUDGET INCREASED FROM 0.6% DURING SPRING TO 3.2% DURING WINTER. THE AQUATIC C LOSS WAS MOST SIGNIFICANT DURING SPRING CONTRIBUTING 8% TO THE ANNUAL NLCB. WE FURTHER FOUND THAT ABIOTIC CONTROLS (E.G., AIR TEMPERATURE AND INCOMING RADIATION) REGULATED THE TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF THE NLCB WHEREAS LAND COVER TYPES (E.G., MIRE VS. FOREST) AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (E.G., CLEAR-CUTTING) DETERMINED THEIR SPATIAL VARIABILITY.

IN THIS PAPER, WE USED THE UNIVERSITY OF VICTORIA EARTH SYSTEM CLIMATE MODEL V. 2.9 TO SIMULATE THE DEGLACIAL AND INTERGLACIAL CARBON CYCLE FROM THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM TO THE PRESENT. THE MODEL'S SENSITIVITY TO MID AND HIGH LATITUDE TERRESTRIAL CARBON STORAGE IS EVALUATED BY INCLUDING A 600 PG C CARBON POOL PARAMETERIZED TO RESPIRE IN CONCERT WITH DECREASES IN ICE SHEET SURFACE AREA. THE RESPIRATION OF THIS STORED CARBON DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF DEGLACIATION HAD A LARGE EFFECT ON THE CARBON CYCLE IN THESE SIMULATIONS, ALLOWING ATMOSPHERIC CO2 TO INCREASE BY 40 PPMV IN THE MODEL, WITH AN ADDITIONAL 20 PPMV INCREASE OCCURRING IN THE CASE OF A MORE REALISTIC, PRESCRIBED CO2 RADIATIVE WARMING. THESE INCREASES OCCURRED PRIOR TO LARGE-SCALE CARBON UPTAKE DUE TO THE REESTABLISHMENT OF BOREAL FORESTS AND PEATLANDS IN THE PROXY RECORD (BEGINNING IN THE EARLY HOLOCENE). SURPRISINGLY, THE LARGE EXTERNAL CARBON INPUT TO THE ATMOSPHERE AND OCEANS DID NOT INCREASE SEDIMENT DISSOLUTION AND MEAN OCEAN ALKALINITY RELATIVE TO A CONTROL SIMULATION WITHOUT THE HIGH LATITUDE CARBON RESERVOIR. IN ADDITION, OUR SIMULATIONS SUGGEST THAT AN EARLY DEGLACIAL TERRESTRIAL CARBON RELEASE MAY COME CLOSER TO EXPLAINING SOME OBSERVED DEGLACIAL CHANGES IN DEEP-OCEAN CARBONATE CONCENTRATIONS THAN SIMULATIONS WITHOUT SUCH A RELEASE.

THIS STUDY PRESENTS SPATIOTEMPORAL CHANGES IN AIR-WATER CO2 EXCHANGE IN THE VAST WETLANDS OF DONANA (SPAIN) IN RELATION TO DIFFERENT HYDROLOGICAL CYCLES. WATER SOURCES FEEDING DONANA, INCLUDING GROUNDWATER AND STREAMS, ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON THE FLUCTUATING BALANCE BETWEEN ANNUAL PRECIPITATION AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION. HENCE, IN ORDER TO EXAMINE THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE RAINFALL PATTERN TO THE EMISSION/CAPTURE OF CO2 BY A RANGE OF AQUATIC HABITATS IN DONANA, WE TOOK MONTHLY MEASUREMENTS DURING SEVERELY WET, DRY, AND NORMAL HYDROLOGICAL YEARS (2010-2013). DURING WET HYDROLOGICAL CYCLES, CO2 OUTGASSING FROM FLOODED MARSHES MARKEDLY DECREASED IN COMPARISON TO THAT OBSERVED DURING SUBSEQUENT DRY-NORMAL CYCLES, WITH MEAN VALUES OF 25.8419 AND 5.28MMOLM(-2)D(-1), RESPECTIVELY. UNDER DRIER METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS, AIR-WATER CO2 FLUXES ALSO DIMINISHED IN PERMANENT FLOODPLAINS AND PONDS, WHICH EVEN BEHAVED AS MILD SINKS FOR ATMOSPHERIC CO2 DURING CERTAIN PERIODS. INCREASED INPUTS OF DISSOLVED CO2 FROM THE UNDERGROUND AQUIFER AND THE STREAM FOLLOWING PERIODS OF HIGH RAINFALL ARE BELIEVED TO BE BEHIND THIS PATTERN. LARGE LAGOONS WITH A MANAGED WATER SUPPLY FROM AN ADJACENT ESTUARY TOOK UP ATMOSPHERIC CO2 NEARLY PERMANENTLY. REGIONAL AIR-WATER CARBON TRANSPORT WAS 15.2GGCYR(-1) UNDER WET AND 1.24GGCYR(-1) UNDER DRY METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS, WELL BELOW THE ESTIMATED NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION FOR DONANA WETLANDS, INDICATING THAT THE ECOSYSTEM ACTS AS A LARGE CO2 SINK. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY WETLANDS ARE PRODUCTIVE ECOSYSTEMS THAT PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE EARTH'S CARBON CYCLE, REPRESENTING IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS TO THE GLOBAL CARBON BUDGET. CLIMATE VARIABILITY AFFECTS PRODUCTIVITY IN WETLANDS, THEREBY MODIFYING THEIR CAPACITY TO ACT AS SINK OR SOURCE FOR ATMOSPHERIC CO2. THIS STUDY ADDRESSES HOW THE HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE INFLUENCES THE CAPACITY FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WETLANDS OF DONANA. COVERING A SURFACE OF 3560KM(2), DONANA REGION INCLUDES A RICH VARIETY OF LANDFORMS AND VEGETATION TYPES REPRESENTATIVE OF MEDITERRANEAN LOWLANDS. ITS WETLANDS ARE ONE OF THE MOST EMBLEMATIC PROTECTED AREAS IN EUROPE WITH A HIGH BIOTIC DIVERSITY AND UNIQUE IMPORTANCE FOR AQUATIC WILDFOWL. THE REGION EXPERIENCES ANNUAL CYCLES OF FLOODING (OCTOBER TO MARCH) AND DESICCATION (MAY TO JUNE), WITH THE INUNDATION CYCLES BEING DEPENDENT ON RAINFALL. OUR MEASUREMENTS SUGGEST THAT DRIER METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS RESULT IN LOWER CO2 EMISSIONS TO THE ATMOSPHERE FROM FLOODED MARSHES AND PERMANENT PONDS WHEREAS LARGE LAGOONS WITH MAN-MANAGED WATER SUPPLY FROM AN ADJACENT ESTUARY BEHAVE AS CARBON SEQUESTRATORS. PREDICTIONS INDICATE AN INCREASING FREQUENCY OF DROUGHTS OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

THAWING PERMAFROST REGIONS ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST BECAUSE THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONALLY AFFECTED BY CLIMATE WARMING AND STORE LARGE RESERVOIRS OF ORGANIC C THAT MAY BE READILY CONVERTED TO CO2 AND CH4 UPON THAW. THIS CONVERSION IS ACCOMPLISHED BY A COMMUNITY OF MICROORGANISMS INTERACTING IN COMPLEX WAYS TO TRANSFORM LARGE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS INTO FATTY ACIDS AND ULTIMATELY CO2 AND CH4. WHILE THE CENTRAL ROLE OF MICROBES IN THIS PROCESS IS WELL-KNOWN, GEOCHEMICAL RATE MODELS RARELY INTEGRATE MICROBIOLOGICAL INFORMATION. HEREIN, WE EXPANDED THE GEOCHEMICAL RATE MODEL OF NEUMANN ET AL., (2016, BIOGEOCHEMISTRY 127: 57-87) TO INCORPORATE A BAYESIAN PROBABILITY ANALYSIS AND APPLIED THE RESULT TO QUANTIFYING RATES OF CO2, CH4, AND ACETATE PRODUCTION IN CLOSED-SYSTEM INCUBATIONS OF PEAT COLLECTED FROM THREE HABITATS ALONG A PERMAFROST THAW GRADIENT. THE GOALS OF THIS ANALYSIS WERE TWOFOLD. FIRST, WE INTEGRATED MICROBIAL COMMUNITY ANALYSES WITH GEOCHEMICAL RATE MODELING BY USING MICROBIAL DATA TO INFORM THE BEST MODEL CHOICE AMONG EQUALLY MATHEMATICALLY FEASIBLE MODEL VARIANTS. SECOND, BASED ON MODEL RESULTS, WE DESCRIBED CHANGES IN ORGANIC CARBON TRANSFORMATION AMONG HABITATS TO UNDERSTAND THE CHANGING PATHWAYS OF GREENHOUSE GAS PRODUCTION ALONG THE PERMAFROST THAW GRADIENT. WE FOUND THAT ACETOCLASTY, HYDROGENOTROPHY, CO2 PRODUCTION, AND HOMOACETOGENESIS WERE THE IMPORTANT REACTIONS IN THIS SYSTEM, WITH LITTLE EVIDENCE FOR ANAEROBIC CH4 OXIDATION. THERE WAS A DISTINCT TRANSITION IN THE REACTIONS ACROSS THE THAW GRADIENT. THE COLLAPSED PALSA STAGE PRESENTS AN INITIAL DISEQUILIBRIUM WHERE THE ABRUPT (PHYSICALLY AND TEMPORALLY) CHANGE IN ELEVATION INTRODUCES FRESHLY FIXED CARBON INTO ANOXIC CONDITIONS THEN FERMENTATION PRODUCTS BUILD UP OVER TIME AS THE SYSTEM TRANSITIONS THROUGH THE ACID PHASE AND ELECTRON ACCEPTORS ARE DEPLETED. IN THE BOG, FERMENTATION SLOWS, WHILE METHANOGENESIS INCREASES. IN THE FULLY THAWED FEN, MOST OF THE TERMINAL ELECTRON ACCEPTORS ARE DEPLETED AND THE SYSTEM BECOMES INCREASINGLY METHANOGENIC.

REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF SURFACE, SUCH LONG-TERM, CONTINUOUS MEASUREMENTS OF THE TURBULENT FLUXES OF METHANE ARE RARE. OUR AIM WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF THE TURBULENT METHANE EXCHANGE IN THE SURFACE-ATMOSPHERE SYSTEM, WHILE CONSIDERING THE IMPACT OF LAND USE. BECAUSE CITIES ARE A HUGE SOURCE OF ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE, WE COMPARED THE INTENSITY OF METHANE EMISSIONS FROM THE CITY AS COMPARED TO THE WETLAND, WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST INTENSE NATURAL SOURCE ATMOSPHERIC METHANE. IN BOTH CASES, THE RESULTS SHOW A CLEAR PREVALENCE OF POSITIVE AS COMPARED WITH NEGATIVE FLUXES. THIS SHOWS THAT BOTH AREAS ARE NET SOURCES OF METHANE TO THE TROPOSPHERE. THE MEASUREMENTS ALSO DEMONSTRATED THE EXISTENCE OF A CLEAR ANNUAL CYCLE OF TURBULENT METHANE FLUX IN THE CENTRE OF THE CITY (AVERAGE VALUES IN WINTER RANGED FROM SIMILAR TO 40 TO 60 NMOL M(-2).S(-1) AND WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN VALUES MEASURED, IN SUMMER) AS WELL AS IN THE WETLANDS, WHERE MAXIMUM VALUES WERE OBSERVED DURING THE WARM PART OF THE YEAR (APPROXIMATELY 80 NMOL M(-2).S(-1) OR MORE). THE DIFFERENT TIMES OF MAXIMUM CH4 FLUX (FCH4) OCCURRENCE RESULTED FROM THE DIFFERENTIATION OF PROCESSES THAT DETERMINE METHANE EMISSIONS: IN THE CITY THESE ARE ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS (STRONGEST IN WINTER); IN THE WETLAND, NATURAL PROCESSES DOMINATE. THE DIURNAL VARIABILITY OF FCH4 WAS FAINTLY DETECTABLE, EXCEPT FOR THE COLD HALF OF THE YEAR IN THE CITY AND THE WARM HALF OF THE YEAR IN THE WETLAND. THE STUDIED AREA OF THE CENTRE OF LODZ, IN TURN, IS ALSO CHARACTERIZED BY A WEEKLY CYCLE OF METHANE EXCHANGE: THE VALUES MEASURED ON WORKING DAYS WERE HIGHER BY 6.6% (WINTER) TO 5.6% (SUMMER) THAN THOSE OBSERVED ON WEEKENDS. DIFFERENCES IN THE ANNUAL EXCHANGE OF METHANE IN 2014 WERE INSIGNIFICANT: THE CENTRE OF LODZ EMITTED 17.4 G M(-2) NET, WHILE THE WETLAND EMITTED ABOUT 18.7 G M(-2) NET. THE RESULTS OF THE MEASUREMENTS PERFORMED DURING THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY TO SEPTEMBER 2015, HOWEVER, SUGGEST THAT A VERY DRY SUMMER, DRYING OF THE SOIL AND, CONSEQUENTLY, A REDUCED WATER LEVEL IN THE FEN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE ABILITY OF THE WETLAND TO EMIT METHANE.

THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT AFTER A THREE-YEAR RESTORATION, COMPARED TO NATURAL RESTORATION TREATMENT, PLANTING OF CAREX SCHMIDTII SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS BY 45% (P < 0.05), INCREASED ROOT BIOMASS BY 53% (P < 0.05), INCREASED THE SHANNON-WIENER INDEX BY 17%, ENHANCED CONCENTRATIONS OF TOTAL SOIL ORGANIC MATTER BY 28% (P < 0.05), REDUCED TOPSOIL BULK DENSITY BY 40% (P < 0.05), AND IMPROVED WATER RETENTION CAPACITY OF THE TOPSOIL. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE ABILITY OF C.

EXISTING SYSTEMS BASED, FOR INSTANCE, ON PEAT FORMATION AND WATER LEVEL ARE RATHER COARSE AND DIFFER BETWEEN COUNTRIES.

OUR RESULTS INDICATE THE NECESSITY OF IMPLEMENTING DIFFERENT TAXONOMIC GROUPS INTO AN OVERALL ECOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT SYSTEM, AS ALL OF THEM REACTED DIFFERENTLY TO DIFFERENT ECOLOGICAL GRADIENTS. ORIBATID MITES WERE THE BEST PREDICTORS OF MOISTURE, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IN PEATLANDS.

VEGETATION, AS THE BEST ESTABLISHED INDICATOR GROUP IN PEATLANDS, SHOWED THE WEAKEST CORRELATIONS TO THE TESTED ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS, PROBABLY DUE TO SHORT-TERM CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND A DELAYED RESPONSE OF THE PLANT COMMUNITY. HENCE, THE SET OF MOST RELEVANT ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS CAN ONLY BE REPRESENTED WHEN MULTIPLE TAXA ARE INCLUDED IN AN ASSESSMENT SYSTEM.

PEAT SMOLDERING CAN EMIT LARGE QUANTITIES OF CARBON AND SMOKE TO THE ATMOSPHERE, AND THEREFORE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO HAZARDOUS AIR QUALITY. THE WILDLAND-INDUSTRY INTERFACE AND WILDLAND-URBAN INTERFACE ARE BOTH EXTENSIVE ACROSS THE SUB-HUMID BOREAL PLAINS (BP) ECOZONE WHERE ONE-THIRD OF THE AREA IS COVERED BY PEATLANDS. AS SUCH, THERE IS A GROWING RESEARCH NEED TO IDENTIFY DRIVERS OF VARIABILITY IN SMOLDERING COMBUSTION. THIS STUDY USES HYDROPHYSICAL PEAT PROPERTIES TO ASSESS THE DRIVERS OF CROSS-SCALE VARIABILITY IN PEAT SMOLDERING COMBUSTION VULNERABILITY IN FORESTED PEATLANDS ACROSS THE BP. USING A SPACE-FOR-TIME CHRONOSEQUENCE ACROSS THE 120 YEAR FIRE RETURN INTERVAL AND THREE MAIN HYDROGEOLOGICAL SETTINGS, AND BY INCORPORATING HUMMOCK, HOLLOW AND MARGIN LOCATIONS, CROSS-SCALE VARIABILITY IS STUDIED. WE FIND THAT, BASED ON PEAT PROPERTIES SUCH AS SPECIFIC YIELD (SY) AND GRAVIMETRIC WATER CONTENT, FORESTED PEATLAND MARGINS REPRESENT AREAS OF HIGH PEAT SMOLDERING VULNERABILITY, AND THAT THIS IS EXACERBATED WITH AN INCREASING TIME-SINCE-FIRE (STAND-AGE). ALTHOUGH INCREASING SY WITH TIME-SINCE-FIRE IN PEATLAND MIDDLES MAY BUFFER WATER TABLE DRAWDOWN, WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR INCREASES IN CANOPY FUEL LOAD, TRANSPIRATION, AND FEATHER MOSS DOMINANCE FORESTED PEATLAND MIDDLES ALSO BECOME MORE VULNERABLE TO SMOLDERING COMBUSTION WITH TIME-SINCE-FIRE. MOREOVER, THE INTERACTION OF PEATLAND MARGINS WITH COARSE- AND HETEROGENEOUS-GRAINED HYDROGEOLOGICAL SETTINGS LEADS TO LOWER SY AND HIGHER DENSITY MARGIN PEAT THAN IN FINE-GRAINED SETTINGS, FURTHER INCREASING SMOLDERING VULNERABILITY.

ORGANIC CARBON STORED IN FLOODPLAINS IS TYPICALLY A PRODUCT OF PEDOGENIC DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN PERIODS OF MINERAL SEDIMENT DEPOSITION. HOWEVER, IN ORGANICALLY-DOMINATED UPLAND CATCHMENTS WITH A HIGH SEDIMENT LOAD, ERODED PARTICULATE ORGANICS MAY ALSO BE FLUVIALLY DEPOSITED WITH POTENTIAL FOR STORAGE AND/OR OXIDATION. UNDERSTANDING THE REDISTRIBUTION OF TERRESTRIAL CARBON LATERALLY, BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF RIVER CHANNELS IS IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY IN ERODING PEATLAND SYSTEMS WHERE FLUVIAL PARTICULATE ORGANIC CARBON EXPORTS ARE OFTEN ASSUMED TO BE OXIDISED. FLOODPLAINS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE BOTH CARBON CYCLING HOTSPOTS AND AREAS OF SEQUESTRATION. UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTERACTION OF CARBON CYCLING AND THE SEDIMENT CASCADE THROUGH FLOODPLAIN SYSTEMS IS LIMITED. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE FORMATION OF HIGHLY ORGANIC FLOODPLAINS DOWNSTREAM OF HEAVILY ERODED PEATLANDS IN THE PEAK DISTRICT, UK. RECONSTRUCTION OF THE HISTORY OF THE FLOODPLAINS SUGGESTS THAT THEY HAVE FORMED IN RESPONSE TO PERIODS OF EROSION OF ORGANIC SOILS UPSTREAM. WE PRESENT A NOVEL APPROACH TO CALCULATING A CARBON STOCK WITHIN A FLOODPLAIN, USING XRF AND RADIOGRAPH DATA RECORDED DURING ITRAX CORE SCANNING OF SEDIMENT CORES. THIS CARBON STOCK IS EXTRAPOLATED TO THE CATCHMENT SCALE, TO ASSESS THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE FLOODPLAINS IN THE STORAGE AND CYCLING OF ORGANIC CARBON IN THIS AREA. THE CARBON STOCK ESTIMATE FOR THE FLOODPLAINS ACROSS THE CONTRIBUTING CATCHMENTS IS BETWEEN 3482-13460 TONNES, EQUATING ON AN ANNUALISED BASIS TO 0.8-4.5% OF THE MODERN-DAY POC FLUX. RADIOCARBON ANALYSES OF BULK ORGANIC MATTER IN FLOODPLAIN SEDIMENTS REVEALED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PROPORTION OF ORGANIC CARBON WAS ASSOCIATED WITH RE-DEPOSITED PEAT AND HAS BEEN USED AS A TOOL FOR ORGANIC MATTER SOURCE DETERMINATION. THE AVERAGE AGE OF THESE SAMPLES (3010 YEARS BP) IS SUBSTANTIALLY OLDER THAN INFRARED STIMULATED LUMINESENCE DATING WHICH DEMONSTRATED THAT THE FLOODPLAINS FORMED BETWEEN 430 AND 1060 YEARS AGO.

PALADYN EXPLICITLY TREATS PERMAFROST, BOTH IN PHYSICAL PROCESSES AND AS AN IMPORTANT CARBON POOL. IT DISTINGUISHES NINE SURFACE TYPES: FIVE DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES, BARE SOIL, LAND ICE, LAKE AND OCEAN SHELF. INCLUDING THE OCEAN SHELF ALLOWS THE TREATMENT OF CONTINUOUS CHANGES IN SEA LEVEL AND SHELF AREA ASSOCIATED WITH GLACIAL CYCLES. OVER EACH SURFACE TYPE, THE MODEL SOLVES THE SURFACE ENERGY BALANCE AND COMPUTES THE FLUXES OF SENSIBLE, LATENT AND GROUND HEAT AND UPWARD SHORTWAVE AND LONGWAVE RADIATION. THE MODEL INCLUDES A SINGLE SNOW LAYER. VEGETATION AND BARE SOIL SHARE A SINGLE SOIL COLUMN. THE SOIL IS VERTICALLY DISCRETIZED INTO FIVE LAYERS WHERE PROGNOSTIC EQUATIONS FOR TEMPERATURE, WATER AND CARBON ARE CONSISTENTLY SOLVED. PHASE CHANGES OF WATER IN THE SOIL ARE EXPLICITLY CONSIDERED. A SURFACE HYDROLOGY MODULE COMPUTES PRECIPITATION INTERCEPTION BY VEGETATION, SURFACE RUNOFF AND SOIL INFILTRATION. THE SOIL WATER EQUATION IS BASED ON DARCY'S LAW. GIVEN SOIL WATER CONTENT, THE WETLAND FRACTION IS COMPUTED BASED ON A TOPOGRAPHIC INDEX. THE TEMPERATURE PROFILE IS ALSO COMPUTED IN THE UPPER PART OF ICE SHEETS AND IN THE OCEAN SHELF SOIL. PHOTOSYNTHESIS IS COMPUTED USING A LIGHT USE EFFICIENCY MODEL. CARBON ASSIMILATION BY VEGETATION IS COUPLED TO THE TRANSPIRATION OF WATER THROUGH STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE.

WE TESTED ENROOT'S ACCURACY AND PRECISION FOR MEASURING FINE ROOT LENGTH AND DIAMETER, AND IT YIELDED LIN'S CONCORDANCE CORRELATION COEFFICIENT VALUES OF 0.95 FOR ROOT DIAMETER AND 0.92 FOR LENGTH. AS A PROOF OF CONCEPT, WE TESTED ENROOT IN A MESOCOSM STUDY, AND IN THE FIELD IN A TROPICAL MANGROVE. ENROOT PROVED ITS CAPACITY TO CAPTURE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ROOTS OF A LEGUME (MEDICAGO SATIVA) AND A MANGROVE SPECIES (SEEDLINGS OF RHIZOPHORA MANGLE) IN LABORATORY MESOCOSMS. ENROOT'S FIELD INSTALLATION WAS POSSIBLE IN THE ROOT-DENSE TROPICAL MANGROVE BECAUSE ITS NARROW DIAMETER ALLOWED IT TO BE INSTALLED BETWEEN LARGER ROOTS AND BECAUSE IT IS FULLY WATERPROOF. ENROOT COMPARES FAVOURABLY WITH COMMERCIAL MINIRHIZOTRONS, AND CAN IMAGE ROOTS AS SMALL AS 56 MU M. CONCLUSION ENROOT REMOVES BARRIERS TO THE EXTENSIVE USE OF MINIRHIZOTRONS BY BEING LOW-COST, EASY TO CONSTRUCT AND ADAPTED TO A WIDE RANGE OF ECOSYSTEM. IT OPENS THE DOORS TO WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTED MINIRHIZOTRON STUDIES ACROSS AN EXTENDED RANGE OF ECOSYSTEMS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO FILL KNOWLEDGE GAPS SURROUNDING FINE ROOT PRODUCTION.","ENROOT: A NARROW-DIAMETER, INEXPENSIVE AND PARTIALLY 3D-PRINTABLE MINIRHIZOTRON FOR IMAGING FINE ROOT PRODUCTION","PLANT METHODS","ARTICLE","AUG 28",2019,"10.1186/s13007-019-0489-6","BIOCHEMICAL RESEARCH METHODS; PLANT SCIENCES","WOS:000483026500001"

THE GREATEST DIVERGENCE BETWEEN MODELED AND OBSERVED SOIL CARBON STOCKS IS IN REGIONS DOMINATED BY PEAT AND PERMAFROST SOILS, SUGGESTING THAT MODELS ARE FAILING TO CAPTURE THE FROZEN SOIL CARBON DYNAMICS OF PERMAFROST REGIONS. USING A SET OF FUNCTIONAL BENCHMARKS TO TEST THE SIMULATED RELATIONSHIP OF SOIL RESPIRATION TO BOTH SOIL TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE, WE FIND THAT ALTHOUGH MODELS CAPTURE THE OBSERVED SHAPE OF THE SOIL MOISTURE RESPONSE OF RESPIRATION, ALMOST HALF OF THE MODELS EXAMINED SHOW TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITIES, OR Q10 VALUES, THAT ARE HALF OF OBSERVED. SIGNIFICANTLY, MODELS THAT PERFORM BETTER AGAINST OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS OF RESPIRATION OR CARBON STOCK SIZE DO NOT NECESSARILY PERFORM WELL IN TERMS OF THEIR FUNCTIONAL RESPONSE TO KEY CLIMATIC FACTORS LIKE CHANGING TEMPERATURE.

TWO CONTRASTING TYPES OF MANAGEMENT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT THE SITE: (1) DRAINAGE DURING ONGOING PEAT HARVESTING ON ONE HALF OF THE CENTRAL BOG AREA AND (2) REWETTING ON THE OTHER HALF THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF USE SHORTLY BEFORE MEASUREMENTS COMMENCED. THE PRESENTED 2-YEAR DATA SET WAS COLLECTED WITH AN EDDY COVARIANCE (EC) SYSTEM SET UP ON A CENTRAL RAILROAD DAM THAT DIVIDES THE TWO HALVES OF THE (FORMER) PEAT HARVESTING AREA. WE USED FOOTPRINT ANALYSIS TO SPLIT THE OBTAINED CO2 AND CH4 FLUX TIME SERIES INTO DATA CHARACTERIZING THE GAS EXCHANGE DYNAMICS OF BOTH CONTRASTING LAND USE TYPES INDIVIDUALLY. THE TIME SERIES GAPS RESULTING FROM DATA DIVISION WERE FILLED USING THE RESPONSE OF ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS (ANNS) TO ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES, FOOTPRINT VARIABILITY, AND FUZZY TRANSFORMATIONS OF SEASONAL AND DIURNAL CYCLICITY. WE USED THE GAP-FILLED GAS FLUX TIME SERIES FROM 2 CONSECUTIVE YEARS TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF REWETTING ON THE ANNUAL VERTICAL CARBON BALANCES OF THE CUTOVER BOG. REWETTING HAD A CONSIDERABLE EFFECT ON THE ANNUAL CARBON FLUXES AND LED TO INCREASED CH4 AND DECREASED CO2 RELEASE. THE LARGER RELATIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CUMULATIVE CO2 FLUXES FROM THE REWETTED (13 +/- 6 MOL M(-2) A(-1)) AND DRAINED (22 +/- 7 MOL M(-2) A(-1)) SECTION OCCURRED IN THE SECOND OBSERVED YEAR WHEN REWETTING APPARENTLY REDUCED CO2 EMISSIONS BY 40 %. THE ABSOLUTE DIFFERENCE IN ANNUAL CH4 FLUX SUMS WAS MORE SIMILAR BETWEEN BOTH YEARS, WHILE THE RELATIVE DIFFERENCE OF CH4 RELEASE BETWEEN THE REWETTED (0.83 +/- 0.15 MOL M(-2) A(-1)) AND DRAINED (0.45 +/- 0.11 MOL M(-2) A(-1)) SECTION WAS LARGER IN THE FIRST OBSERVED YEAR, INDICATING A MAXIMUM INCREASE IN ANNUAL CH4 RELEASE OF 84% CAUSED BY REWETTING AT THIS PARTICULAR SITE DURING THE STUDY PERIOD.","COMPARISON OF EDDY COVARIANCE CO2 AND CH4 FLUXES FROM MINED AND RECENTLY REWETTED SECTIONS IN A NORTHWESTERN GERMAN CUTOVER BOG","BIOGEOSCIENCES","ARTICLE","MAY 28",2020,"10.5194/bg-17-2853-2020","ECOLOGY; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000537719000002"

HERE WE STUDY THE SOIL ORGANIC CARBON OF TWO TROPICAL LOWLAND WETLANDS (FLUVIAL AND ISOLATED), LOCATED IN THE INTERANDEAN VALLEY OF THE MAGDALENA RIVER IN COLOMBIA. SOIL CORES WERE EXTRACTED FROM 11 SAMPLING ZONES DISTRIBUTED IN THE TWO WETLANDS, INCLUDING THE DRYLAND ADJACENT TO EACH WETLAND.

MICROBES INVOLVED IN ANAEROBIC PROCESSES, ESPECIALLY METHANOGENS, COULD REFLECT THE STABILIZATION OF ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS, VEGETATION SUCCESSION AND OVERALL RESTORATION SUCCESS. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF LONG-TERM DRAINAGE AND HYDROLOGICAL REWETTING ON METHANOGENIC ABUNDANCE, COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND CH4 PRODUCTION POTENTIAL IN BOGS AND SPRUCE SWAMP FORESTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE SUBSTRATE LIMITATION OF METHANOGENS WAS TESTED WITH A FOCUS ON ORIGINAL PEATLAND PLANT SPECIES AND THEIR SPREADING AFTER REWETTING BY ADDITION OF NATURAL SUBSTRATES. DRAINAGE STRONGLY REDUCED THE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF THE METHANOGENIC COMMUNITY. AFTER REWETTING, METHANOGENIC ABUNDANCE AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION REACHED ALMOST A PRISTINE-LIKE STATE, HOWEVER THEIR CH4 PRODUCTION REMAINED AS LOW AS IN THE DRAINED SITES. SUBSTRATE ADDITION CONFIRMED THE SUBSTRATE LIMITATION OF METHANOGENS DUE TO STRONGLY DECOMPOSED PEAT AND THE SLOW SPREADING OF ORIGINAL PEATLAND VEGETATION. THE ADDITION OF NATURAL SUBSTRATES SUPPORTED METHANOGENESIS CLOSE TO A PRISTINE-LIKE LEVEL.

OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT HIGH WATER TABLE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION, WHILE IT HAD NO NET EFFECT ON N2O AND CH4 FLUXES. UPTAKE OF AVAILABLE N BY THE COVER CROP SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED NITRATE IN SOIL SOLUTION, THEREBY LOWERING THE POTENTIAL FOR LEACHING AND BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT N2O EMISSIONS.

THEREFORE, IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO RECONSTRUCT THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF C-3/C-4 VEGETATION IN SOUTHERN CHINA AND CLARIFY THE INFLUENCING MECHANISM OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IN THIS STUDY, WE SYSTEMATICALLY ANALYZED STABLE CARBON ISOTOPE (DELTA C-13) OF THE LONG-CHAIN N-ALKANES IN SEDIMENT SAMPLES FROM EIGHT LAKES AND FOUR PEAT PROFILES IN SOUTHERN CHINA, TO RECONSTRUCT THE SPATIOTEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF C-3/C-4 VEGETATION IN THESE REGIONS SINCE THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM (LGM) AND TO INVESTIGATE THE CLIMATE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE C-4 PLANT ABUNDANCE CHANGE IN THE RESEARCH AREA. THE INTEGRATED LONG-CHAIN N-ALKANE (C-27-C-33) STABLE CARBON ISOTOPE RESULTS OF SAMPLES FROM ZHANJIANG HUGUANGYAN MAAR LAKE, XINGYUN LAKE, LUGU LAKE AND DINGNAN PEAT SHOWED THAT, FROM THE LGM TO THE EARLY HOLOCENE, C-4 PLANT RELATIVE ABUNDANCE EXHIBITED A GRADUALLY INCREASING TREND FROM 21% TO 34%. IN THE MIDDLE HOLOCENE, THE C-4 PLANT ABUNDANCE SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED AND REACHED A LOWEST VALUE OF 10%. IN SPACE, THE C-4 PLANT ABUNDANCE GENERALLY EXHIBITED A GRADUALLY DECLINING TREND FROM SOUTH TO NORTH IN THE LGM AND THE EARLY HOLOCENE, WHILE IT SHOWED AN OPPOSITE TREND IN THE HOLOCENE CLIMATE OPTIMUM (6.0 CAL KA BP). IT REFLECTED THAT THE MAIN INFLUENCING FACTOR ON C-4 PLANTS SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION WAS CHANGING FROM TEMPERATURE TO PRECIPITATION. THIS STUDY INDICATED THAT TEMPERATURE WAS THE DOMINANT FACTOR AFFECTING C-4 PLANT DISTRIBUTION IN SOUTHERN CHINA, HOWEVER, WHEN THE TEMPERATURE CONDITION WAS APPROPRIATE, AN INCREASE IN PRECIPITATION (ESPECIALLY MORE SPRING PRECIPITATION) WOULD REDUCE THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OF C-4 PLANTS. THEREFORE, THE COMBINATION OF TEMPERATURE AND SEASONAL PRECIPITATION WAS THE IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT DETERMINES THE C-3/C-4 VEGETATION PROPORTION CHANGE IN THE SOUTHERN CHINA. UNDER THE PREMISE THAT THE TEMPERATURE WILL RISE AND PRECIPITATION WILL INCREASE IN THE FUTURE, THE REDUCTION OF A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR THE C-4 PLANTS COULD AFFECT AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN CHINA.","SPATIOTEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF C-3/C-4 VEGETATION AND ITS CONTROLLING FACTORS IN SOUTHERN CHINA SINCE THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM","SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES","ARTICLE","AUG",2019,"10.1007/s11430-018-9225-9","GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000473821100001"

A GROWING BODY OF LITERATURE DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER (DOM) IN GOVERNING ANAEROBIC METABOLISM IN ORGANIC SOIL, BUT EXACTLY HOW THE REDUCTION-OXIDATION (REDOX) ACTIVITIES OF DOM, AND PARTICULARLY THE PHENOLIC FRACTION, ARE LIKELY TO CHANGE IN AN ALTERED CLIMATE REMAIN UNCLEAR. WE USED LARGE MESOCOSMS IN THE PEATCOSM EXPERIMENT TO ASSESS CHANGES IN PEATLAND DOM AND REDOX POTENTIAL IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATIONS OF WATER TABLE (WT) POSITION AND PLANT FUNCTIONAL GROUPS (PFGS). WT POSITION AND PFGS INTERACTED IN THEIR EFFECTS ON REDOX POTENTIAL AND QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF DOM. PHENOLICS WERE GENERALLY OF HIGHER MOLECULAR WEIGHT AND MORE OXIDIZED WITH SEDGES IN LOWERED WTS. ALTERED DOM CHARACTER INCLUDED CHANGES IN DISSOLVED NITROGEN (N), WITH HIGHER N: [PHENOLICS] WITH HIGHER E4:E6 (ABSORBANCE RATIO LAMBDA = 465:665) DOM IN THE LOWERED WT AND SEDGE PFG TREATMENTS. CONVERSELY, BIOMOLECULAR ASSIGNMENTS TO AMINO-SUGARS WERE LARGELY ABSENT FROM LOW-WT TREATMENTS. LOW WT RESULTED IN THE CREATION OF UNIQUE N COMPOUNDS, WHICH WERE MORE CONDENSED (LOWER H:C), THAT CHANGED WITH DEPTH AND PFG. THE ACCUMULATION OF OXIDIZED COMPOUNDS WITH LOW WT AND IN SEDGE RHIZOSPHERES COULD BE VERY IMPORTANT POOLS OF ELECTRON ACCEPTORS BENEATH THE WT, AND THEIR MECHANISMS OF FORMATION ARE DISCUSSED. THIS WORK SUGGESTS THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN VEGETATION COMMUNITIES CAN BE AS GREAT AS WT POSITION IN DIRECTLY AND INTERACTIVELY MEDIATING PEAT REDOX ENVIRONMENT AND THE REDOX-ACTIVITY OF DOM. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY PEATLANDS ARE IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEMS IN BOTH THE GLOBAL CARBON (C) CYCLE AND THE EARTH'S CLIMATE SYSTEM OWING TO THEIR ABILITY TO STORE VAST QUANTITIES OF C TAKEN FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. PEAT C STAYS LOCKED UP IN THESE ECOSYSTEMS LARGELY OWING TO COOL AND WET CONDITIONS, AND AS SUCH, THESE C STORES ARE VULNERABLE TO RELEASE BACK TO THE ATMOSPHERE IF THE CLIMATE OR WATER LEVELS CHANGE. WATER TABLE LEVEL AND PLANT SPECIES COMPOSITION HAVE A COMBINED EFFECT ON C AND NITROGEN (N) CYCLING IN PEATLANDS. WE MANIPULATED BOTH FACTORS IN AN EXPERIMENTAL SETTING COMPOSED OF 24 LARGE BINS INTO WHICH WE PUT INTACT PEATLAND MINIECOSYSTEMS. SEDGES PLAY A BIG ROLE IN PRODUCING N COMPOUNDS BELOW THE PEAT SURFACE, AND THIS WORK SUGGESTS THESE COMPOUNDS CAN ACTUALLY BE SYNTHESIZED INTO LARGER, LESS ACCESSIBLE COMPOUNDS. IN ADDITION, ACTIVITIES OF SEDGE ROOTS AND OTHER DOMINANT PLANT COMMUNITIES (SUCH AS SHRUBS IN THE HEATH FAMILY OF PLANTS) MAY INTERACT IN THE SYNTHESIS OF OXIDIZED, LARGER MOLECULES. THESE MOLECULES CAN ALLOW MICROBES TO CONTINUE TO DECOMPOSE PEAT EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF OXYGEN. THIS COULD INCREASE THE RELEASE OF GREENHOUSE GAS CARBON DIOXIDE TO THE ATMOSPHERE, WHILE REDUCING INPUTS OF THE STRONGER GREENHOUSE GAS METHANE.","REDUCTION-OXIDATION POTENTIAL AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER COMPOSITION IN NORTHERN PEAT SOIL: INTERACTIVE CONTROLS OF WATER TABLE POSITION AND PLANT FUNCTIONAL GROUPS","JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES","ARTICLE","NOV",2019,"10.1029/2019JG005339","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","WOS:000505298700024"

ACCORDING TO THE CURRENT ESTIMATES, THE AREA OF PEAT BOGS IS 1.68 MILLION KM(2), WITH WETLANDS - 3.69 MILLION KM(2). ALL THESE LANDS CONTAIN MORE THAN 100 BILLION TONS OF CARBON (GT 100.93). RUSSIA RANKS FIRST IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF ACCUMULATED PEAT. ANNUALLY 66 THOUSAND HA ARE SWAMPED IN THE WORLD. THE AVERAGE SPEED OF PALUDIFICATION IN RUSSIA IN HOLOCENE WAS 15... 18 THOUSAND HA PER YEAR. IT VARIED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CHANGING CLIMATIC, HYDROLOGICAL, GEOLOGICAL, MORPHOLOGICAL AND OTHER FACTORS, AND IT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN SOME NATURAL ZONES AND REGIONS OF RUSSIA. FOR EXAMPLE, THE AVERAGE RATE OF PALUDIFICATION IN KARELIA (NORTH-WESTERN PART OF RUSSIA) IN HOLOCENE WAS 400 HA PER YEAR, WHILE IT RANGED FROM 150 TO 755 HA PER YEAR. THE MOST INTENSIVE LOGGING AND PEAT ACCUMULATION WAS FOUND DURING THE ATLANTIC PERIOD OF HOLOCENE, WHEN THE TYPES OF WETLAND ECOSYSTEMS AND THEIR BALANCE WERE CHANGED. THE OTHER AREAS OF NORTH-WESTERN AND WESTERN SIBERIA OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION HAVE SIMILARITIES OF WATERLOGGING.

MARSH DRAINAGE MAY INCREASE THE EMISSIONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. TO DETERMINE THE CURRENT (OVER THE SEASONS, DECADES) RATE OF NET CARBON ACCUMULATION THE BALANCE METHOD AND THE METHOD OF MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF THE MARSH ECOSYSTEM ARE USED. THE CALCULATIONS OF THE PRESENT RATE OF NET CARBON ACCUMULATION BY THE SWAMPS ACCORDING TO THE R. CLYMO MODEL (AS MODIFIED BY I.E. TURCHINOVICH) SHOWED THAT IT WAS 37.6 MILLION TONS OF CARBON PER YEAR.

MEAN ANNUAL TOC CONCENTRATIONS IN THE NAREW RIVER BASIN WERE HIGHER THAN 10-11 MG C L-1 WHICH IS SIMILAR TO NEMORAL OR BALTIC RIVERS. THE MAXIMAL MONTHLY TOC CONCENTRATIONS OCCURRED IN MAY WITH A ONE-MONTH DELAY FROM THE SPRING MAXIMUM OF WATER OUTFLOW. HIGH TOC CONCENTRATIONS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY NATURALLY INCREASED ORGANIC NITROGEN AND PHOSPHOROUS CONCENTRATIONS RESULTING IN DECREASED WATER QUALITY CLASS DESPITE THE ANTHROPOGENIC PRESSURE IS LOW. MEAN ANNUAL EXPORT OF TOC FROM THE NAREW RIVER CATCHMENT AMOUNTED TO 2.15 G C M(-2), WHICH IS NEARLY 25% HIGHER THAN FOR THE VISTULA RIVER, THE RECIPIENT. TOC EXPORT FORM THE ANALYSED RIVER BASIN IN DRY YEARS WAS 30% LOWER AND 50% HIGHER IN WET YEARS THAN THE MULTIANNUAL AVERAGE. THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF HIGH TOC CONCENTRATIONS IN THE NAREW RIVER CATCHMENT AND HIGH TOC EXPORT IS THE OCCURRENCE OF BIOGEOCHEMICALLY ACTIVE WETLANDS, FUNCTIONING NOT ONLY THANKS TO SPRING FLOODING OF THE VALLEYS, BUT ALSO BASED ON PERMANENT INTENSIVE GROUNDWATERS SUPPLY FROM SURROUNDING PLATEAUS. THIS EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANCE OF BASIN HYDROLOGY IN THE REGULATION OF CARBON CYCLING IN THE TEMPERATE LOWLAND CATCHMENTS. OUR RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT IN ENVIRONMENTAL ZONATION OF EUROPE NAREW RIVER CATCHMENT SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS BELONGING TO THE BALTIC PROVINCE (NEMORAL ENVIRONMENTAL ZONE) RATHER THEN TO CONTINENTAL ZONE. THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS CHARACTERIZED WITH HIGH RIVERINE TOC CONCENTRATIONS AND NATURAL WATER OXYGEN DEPLETION IN SUMMERS. THUS, ENVIRONMENTAL STRATIFICATION OF EUROPE DEVELOPED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS AND MONITORING SHOULD BE RE-EVALUATED.

IN THIS STUDY, THE NET CARBON DIOXIDE UPTAKE AND THE ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION WERE MEASURED USING A PAIR OF CLEAR AND DARK CHAMBERS, CONNECTED TO A GREENHOUSE GAS ANALYZER IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION (GPP). ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY ACTIVE RADIATION (PAR), PEAT SOIL TEMPERATURE, SOIL MOISTURE, ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY AND WATER TABLE DEPTH (WTD), AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC) IN THE SOIL PORE WATER WERE ALSO INVESTIGATED AT EACH SITE. OUR RESULTS CONFIRMED A CORRELATION BETWEEN WATER TABLE DEPTH, PEAT SOIL TEMPERATURE, ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY AND PEATLAND PRODUCTIVITY. CHANGES IN ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY, WATER TABLE DEPTH, AND PEAT SOIL TEMPERATURE TOGETHER EXPLAINED 61% OF GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY VARIANCE AT OUR DRAINED PEATLAND PASTURE SITE. IN GENERAL, PLANT FUNCTIONAL TYPES/GROWTH FORMS DID NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THEIR GPP AT THE DRAINED SITE EXCEPT SHRUBS WHICH HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER GPP AT PAR LEVEL GREATER THAN 1000 MU MOL/M(2)/S (F(3,30.84) = 11.64, P < 0.001).

WE THEREFORE CONCLUDED THAT WATER SHORTAGE TO THE SHALLOW ROOTING DEPTH OF SHRUBS ON OUR HUMMOCK SUBPLOTS MAY BE THE CAUSE OF THE LOW PRODUCTIVITY. AT PAR GREATER THAN 1000 MU MOL/M(2)/S, PRODUCTIVITY AT THE HOLLOW WAS STILL SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER (0.17 +/- 0.002 MG/M(2)/S) COMPARED TO THE HUMMOCK (0.10 +/- 0.00 MG/M(2)/S). THIS SUGGESTS THAT, FOR ECOSYSTEM CARBON MODELLING, THE MINIMUM PAR LEVEL AT WHICH THE GPP IS ESTIMATED IS VERY CRUCIAL. ALL THE GROWTH FORMS AT THE DRAINED SITE RECORDED A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER GPP THAN THE MICROFORMS AT THE NATURAL SITE. WE SPECULATE THAT NOT ONLY HYDROLOGICAL CHANGES VIA AGRICULTURAL DRAINAGE CAN AFFECT THE CARBON BALANCE OF BOREAL PEATLAND ECOSYSTEM THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS, BUT ALSO THE HYDROLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE PEAT DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN PEAT SOIL MAKEUP, STRUCTURE AND DENSITY.

THE CONTINUOUSLY EVOLVING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS (E.G., WATER TABLE RISE, INCREASING PEAT THICKNESS) IN PALUDIFIED FORESTS MAY REQUIRE TREE GROWTH MECHANISM ADJUSTMENTS OVER TIME. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATE TREE ECOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS ALONG A PALUDIFICATION GRADIENT IN A BOREAL FORESTED PEATLAND OF EASTERN CANADA BY COMBINING PEAT-BASED AND TREE-RING ANALYSES.

USUALLY, THE RESULTING CARBON MATERIAL, CALLED HYDROCHAR, PRODUCES A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON PLANT GROWTH WHEN ADDED TO SOIL. IT IS SUPPOSED THAT THIS EFFECT IS CAUSED BY ADSORBED PHYTOTOXIC COMPOUNDS. A SIMPLE POST-TREATMENT UNDER INERT ATMOSPHERE (ABSENCE OF OXYGEN) AT 275 DEGREES C REMOVES THESE SUBSTANCES. THEREFORE, THE RAW HYDROCHAR IS PLACED ON A GLASS FRIT OF A VERTICAL TUBULAR QUARTZ REACTOR. A NITROGEN GAS FLOW IS APPLIED IN DOWN-FLOW DIRECTION. THE TUBE IS HEATED TO THE DESIRED TEMPERATURE BY MEANS OF A HEATING MANTLE FOR UP TO ONE HOUR. THE SUCCESS OF THE THERMAL TREATMENT IS EASILY QUANTIFIED BY THERMOGRAVIMETRY (TG), CARRIED OUT IN AIR.

BASED ON MODEL RESULTS, THE EXPECTATION WAS THAT SSI WOULD REDUCE PEAT DECOMPOSITION IN SUMMER BY PREVENTING GROUNDWATER TABLES (GWTS) FROM DROPPING BELOW -60 CM. IN 2017-2018, WE EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF SSI ON GHG EMISSIONS (CO2, CH4, N2O) FOR FOUR DAIRY FARMS ON DRAINED PEAT MEADOWS IN THE NETHERLANDS. EACH FARM HAD A TREATMENT SITE WITH SSI INSTALLATION AND A CONTROL SITE DRAINED ONLY BY DITCHES (DITCH WATER LEVEL -60 / -90 CM, 100 M DISTANCE BETWEEN DITCHES). THE SSI SYSTEM CONSISTED OF PERFORATED PIPES -70 CM FROM SURFACE LEVEL WITH SPACING OF 5-6 M TO IMPROVE DRAINAGE DURING WINTER-SPRING AND IRRIGATION IN SUMMER. GHG EMISSIONS WERE MEASURED USING CLOSED CHAMBERS EVERY 2-4 WEEKS FOR CO2, CH4 AND N2O. MEASURED ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION (R-ECO) ONLY SHOWED A SMALL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SSI AND CONTROL SITES WHEN THE GWT OF SSI SITES WERE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN THE CONTROL SITE (> 20 CM DIFFERENCE). OVER ALL YEARS AND LOCATIONS, HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FOUND, DESPITE THE 6-18 CM HIGHER GWT IN SUMMER AND 1-20 CM LOWER GWT IN WET CONDITIONS AT SSI SITES. DIFFERENCES IN MEAN ANNUAL GWT REMAINED LOW (< 5 CM). DIRECT COMPARISON OF MEASURED N2O AND CH4 FLUXES BETWEEN SSI AND CONTROL SITES DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES. CO2 FLUXES VARIED ACCORDING TO TEMPERATURE AND MANAGEMENT EVENTS, WHILE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CONTROL AND SSI SITES REMAINED SMALL. THEREFORE, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ANNUAL GAP-FILLED NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE (NEE) OF THE SSI AND CONTROL SITES.

HOWEVER, TOOLS HAVE NOT BEEN DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR THESE PURPOSES, AND IN PARTICULAR FOR THE BOREAL FOREST OF CANADA, SO CURRENT FOREST C ASSESSMENTS IN EIAS TAKE RELATIVELY SIMPLE APPROACHES. HERE, WE DEMONSTRATE HOW AN EXISTING TOOL, THE GENERIC CARBON BUDGET MODEL (GCBM), DEVELOPED FOR NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL FOREST C REPORTING, WAS USED FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF ANTHROPOGENIC AND NATURAL DISTURBANCES TO SUPPORT EIA REQUIREMENTS. WE APPLIED THE GCBM TO APPROXIMATELY 1.3 MILLION HA OF UPLAND FOREST IN A PILOT STUDY AREA OF THE OIL SANDS REGION OF ALBERTA THAT HAS EXPERIENCED A LARGE NUMBER OF ANTHROPOGENIC (FORESTRY, ENERGY SECTOR) AND NATURAL (WILDFIRE, INSECT) DISTURBANCES. RESULTS: OVER THE 28 YEARS, 25% OF THE PILOT STUDY AREA WAS DISTURBED. INCREASING DISTURBANCE EMISSIONS, COMBINED WITH DECLINING NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY AND REDUCTIONS IN FOREST AREA, CHANGED THE STUDY AREA FROM A NET C SINK TO A NET C SOURCE. FOREST C STOCKS CHANGED FROM 332.2 MT TO 327.5 MT, DECLINING BY 4.7 MT AT AN AVERAGE RATE OF 0.128 TC HA(-1) YR(-1). THE LARGEST CUMULATIVE AREAS OF DISTURBANCE WERE CAUSED BY WILDFIRE (139,000 HA), FOLLOWED BY THE ENERGY SECTOR (110,000 HA), INSECTS (33,000 HA) AND HARVESTING (31,000 HA) BUT THE LARGEST CUMULATIVE DISTURBANCE EMISSIONS WERE CAUSED BY THE ENERGY SECTOR (9.5 MT C), FOLLOWED BY WILDFIRE (5.5 MT C), AND THEN HARVESTING (1.3 MT C). CONCLUSION: AN EXISTING FOREST C MODEL WAS USED SUCCESSFULLY TO PROVIDE A RIGOROUS REGIONAL CUMULATIVE ASSESSMENT OF ANTHROPOGENIC AND NATURAL DISTURBANCES ON FOREST C, WHICH MEETS REQUIREMENTS OF EIAS IN CANADA. THE ASSESSMENT SHOWED THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF DISTURBANCES ON C EMISSIONS IN THE PILOT STUDY AREA, BUT THEIR RELATIVE IMPORTANCE IS EXPECTED TO CHANGE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE OIL SANDS REGION BECAUSE OF ITS DIVERSITY IN DISTURBANCE TYPES, PATTERNS AND INTENSITY.

WE TESTED THIS 'SURVIVAL OF THE DEEPEST' HYPOTHESIS BY EXAMINING WATER TABLE (WT) POSITION, NEAR-SURFACE MOISTURE CONTENT, AND SOIL WATER TENSION IN PEATLANDS THAT DIFFER IN SIZE, PEAT DEPTH, AND CATCHMENT AREA DURING A SUMMER DROUGHT. ALL SHALLOW SITES (<40 CM DEPTH) LOST THEIR WT (I.E., THE GROUNDWATER WELL WAS DRY) FOR CONSIDERABLE TIME DURING THE DROUGHT PERIOD. NEAR-SURFACE SOIL WATER TENSION INCREASED DRAMATICALLY AT SHALLOW SITES FOLLOWING WT LOSS, INCREASING SIMILAR TO 5-7.5X GREATER AT SHALLOW SITES COMPARED TO DEEP SITES (>= 40 CM DEPTH). DURING A MID-SUMMER DROUGHT INTENSIVE FIELD SURVEY, WE FOUND THAT 60-67% OF PLOTS AT SHALLOW SITES EXCEEDED A 100 MB TENSION THRESHOLD USED TO INFER MOSS WATER STRESS.

SOIL ENZYMES ARE INVOLVED IN BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLE OF SOIL CARBON (C), NITROGEN (N) AND PHOSPHORUS (P), WHICH CAN BE USED AS EARLY SENSITIVE INDICATORS OF SOIL NUTRIENT CHANGES CAUSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. TO PREDICT THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF PERMAFROST DEGRADATION ON SOIL ENZYMES IN PEATLANDS, TEN PEATLANDS FROM THREE TYPES OF PERMAFROST REGIONS ALONG THE PERMAFROST DEGRADATION SEQUENCE (PREDOMINANTLY CONTINUOUS PERMAFROST REGION-PREDOMINANTLY CONTINUOUS AND ISLAND PERMAFROST REGION-SPARSELY ISLAND PERMAFROST REGION) IN NORTHEAST CHINA WERE SELECTED TO EXAMINE THE ACTIVITIES OF SOIL INVERTASE, BETA-GLUCOSIDASE, UREASE AND ACID PHOSPHATASE AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOIL PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT PERMAFROST TYPE HAD SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON SOIL ENZYME ACTIVITIES. SOIL ENZYME ACTIVITIES IN PREDOMINANTLY CONTINUOUS AND ISLAND PERMAFROST REGION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THOSE IN SPARSELY ISLAND PERMAFROST REGION AND PREDOMINANTLY CONTINUOUS PERMAFROST REGION. THE ACTIVITIES OF FOUR SOIL ENZYMES WERE HIGHER IN 0-15 CM THAN 15-30 CM SOIL LAYER. SOIL ENZYMES ACTIVITIES WERE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH SOIL AMMONIA NITROGEN (NH4+-N), SOIL MOISTURE CONTENT (SMC), TOTAL PHOSPHORUS (TP) AND TOTAL NITROGEN (TN), BUT NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH SOIL NITRATE NITROGEN (NO3--N). SOIL INORGANIC NITROGEN AND MOISTURE CONTENTS WERE THE MAIN FACTORS AFFECTING SOIL ENZYME ACTIVITIES, WITH NH4+-N ACCOUNTED FOR 41.6% OF THE VARIANCE, SMC 29.6%, AND NO3--N 11.0%. THESE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT PERMAFROST DEGRADATION MAY CHANGE SOIL ENZYME ACTIVITIES BY CHANGING SOIL PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES. IN THIS STUDY, ONLY 0-30 CM PEAT SOIL IN PERMAFROST REGIONS WAS COLLECTED DURING THE COMPLETE THAWING PERIOD OF PERMAFROST ACTIVE LAYER, FURTHER STUDIES SHOULD BE PLACED ON THE CHANGE OF SOIL ENZYME ACTIVITIES IN ACTIVE LAYER AND PERMAFROST LAYER DURING FREEZING AND THAWING PROCESS IN THE SOUTHERNMOST LOCATION OF NORTHEAST CHINA IN THE EURASIA PERMAFROST BODY AND BOREAL FOREST BELT.","SOIL ENZYME ACTIVITIES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOIL C, N, AND P IN PEATLANDS FROM DIFFERENT TYPES OF PERMAFROST REGIONS, NORTHEAST CHINA","FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE","ARTICLE","MAY 20",2021,"10.3389/fenvs.2021.670769","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","WOS:000657279100001"

ACTIVE LAYER THICKENING, WIDESPREAD MELTING OF GROUND ICE AND THERMO-EROSION HAVE AFFECTED THE MOBILIZATION OF ORGANIC AND MINERAL ELEMENTS. WHILE THE CARBON AND NITROGEN CYCLES ARE INTENSIVELY STUDIED, THE SOIL WEATHERING HAS BEEN LESS DOCUMENTED. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE MONITORED THE CHEMISTRY OF SOIL CAPILLARY AND GRAVITATIONAL PORE WATERS, RAINFALL AND STREAM WATERS DAILY DURING THE GROWING SEASON IN TWO EXPERIMENTAL SITES UNDER TUSSOCK TUNDRA VEGETATION IN THE LOW-ARCTIC REGION, IN SALLUIT (NUNAVIK, CANADA). WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE SEASONAL THAW CONTROLS ON THE EVOLUTION OF CONCENTRATIONS OF MAJOR ORGANIC AND INORGANIC ELEMENTS IN THE ACTIVE LAYER (I.E., SEASONALLY THAWED SURFACE LAYERS) OF TWO PERMAFROST SOILS (CRYOSOLS) DIFFERING IN PARENTAL MATERIALS: AN OMBROTROPHIC BOG (I.E., HISTIC CRYOSOL) AND POST-GLACIAL MARINE SEDIMENTS CONTINUOUSLY WATERLOGGED (I.E., TURBIC CRYOSOL). IN THE HISTIC CRYOSOL, THE ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY WAS <100 MU S CM(-1) AND CL- AND NA+ WERE THE DOMINANT SOLUBLE IONS ORIGINATING FROM ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITIONS. IN THE TURBIC CRYOSOL, DECARBONATED IN THE FIRST 40 CM, CA2+ AND MG2+ WERE THE DOMINANT SOLUBLE IONS IN THE CAPILLARY WATER REFLECTING THE DISSOLUTION OF SOIL MINERALS, WHILE CL- AND SO42- DOMINATED IN GRAVITATIONAL WATER, ILLUSTRATING INPUTS FROM UPHILL. IN THE TWO SOILS, CA2+ AND MG2+ CONCENTRATIONS AS WELL AS MG/NA AND CA/NA INCREASED WITH DEPTH. ALONG SUMMER, THE SOIL PORE WATER CHEMISTRY EVOLVED WITH THAW FRONT AND WATER TABLE DEPTHS IN THE TWO SITES. PARTICULARLY IN THE HISTIC CRYOSOL, ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY, SOLUTE CONCENTRATIONS, MG/NA AND CA/NA RATIOS INCREASED WITH THE THAW FRONT DEEPENING. OUR OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT THE ACTIVE LAYER THICKENING AND INCREASING SUPRA-PERMAFROST FLOW CONTRIBUTION, EXPECTED TO INCREASE WITH ARCTIC WARMING, COULD LEAD TO A SHIFT IN CHEMISTRY OF PORE WATERS IN ORGANIC AND MINERAL PERMAFROST SOILS, DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON PERMAFROST LANDFORM SETTINGS.","SEASONAL CRYOGENIC PROCESSES CONTROL SUPRA-PERMAFROST PORE WATER CHEMISTRY IN TWO CONTRASTING CRYOSOLS","GEODERMA","ARTICLE","NOV 1",2021,"10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115302","SOIL SCIENCE","WOS:000667306700022"

THIS HAS GLOBAL IMPLICATIONS FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ECOSYSTEM CARBON (C) STORAGE AND LOSS. THOUGH AEROBIC CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) PRODUCTION IS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD TO FOLLOW AN ARRHENIUS-TYPE TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE, THE TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY OF ANAEROBIC METABOLISMS SUCH AS IRON (FE) REDUCTION AND METHANE (CH4) FLUXES, BOTH PROCESSES AFFECTING C CYCLING IN SOILS, REMAINS UNCLEAR IN UPLAND SOILS. WE USED A FULLY FACTORIAL INCUBATION EXPERIMENT TO EXAMINE THE INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE (8, 26, AND 35 DEGREES C) AND REDOX (OXIC AND ANOXIC) CONDITIONS ON CO2 PRODUCTION, CH4 FLUXES, FE REDUCTION, MICROBIAL BIOMASS C, AND THE MICROBIAL METABOLIC QUOTIENT (MMQ) IN UPLAND SOILS FROM TWO CONTRASTING CLIMATE REGIMES AND REDOX ENVIRONMENTS: A TROPICAL FOREST IN PUERTO RICO (PR) AND A TEMPERATE PEATLAND IN CALIFORNIA (CA). UNDER OXIC CONDITIONS, WE FOUND THAT CO2 PRODUCTION INCREASED ACROSS BOTH TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS (8-26 DEGREES C AND 26-35 DEGREES C). IN CONTRAST, UNDER ANOXIC CONDITIONS, NET CH4 FLUXES AND FE REDUCTION EXHIBITED A GREATER TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY BETWEEN 26 AND 35 DEGREES C THAN 8-26 DEGREES C IN BOTH PR AND CA SOILS. WE ALSO OBSERVED COUPLING BETWEEN FE REDUCTION AND NET CH4 FLUXES IN PR AND CA SOILS CONSISTENT WITH COMPETITION FOR ACETATE. THE ANOXIC MMQ INCREASED IN PR SOILS AT HIGH TEMPERATURE, BUT NOT IN CA SOILS, SUGGESTING THAT THE NATIVE PR ENVIRONMENT MAY FAVOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE EFFICIENT MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES BETTER ABLE TO TOLERATE WARMER, WETTER CONDITIONS. TOGETHER, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ANAEROBIC MICROBIAL METABOLISMS MAY BE MUCH MORE SENSITIVE TO HIGHER TEMPERATURE THAN AEROBIC ONES, POSSIBLY DUE TO PROPORTIONALLY GREATER ANAEROBIC MICROBIAL ACTIVITY AT HIGH TEMPERATURE. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT INCREASED GLOBAL TEMPERATURES COMBINED WITH HIGHER RAINFALL REGIMES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE ANAEROBIC GREENHOUSE GAS PRODUCTION IN HUMID ENVIRONMENTS.","INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE AND REDOX ON SOIL CARBON AND IRON CYCLING","SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY","ARTICLE","JUN",2021,"10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108235","SOIL SCIENCE","WOS:000643701100006"

THE RHONE-AARE-GLACIER SYSTEM GAVE RISE TO LARGE MOORLANDS AND LAKES IN THE REGION OF THE THREE LAKES REGION OF WESTERN SWITZERLAND. WHEN MOORLANDS ARE FORMED, THEY ARE EFFICIENT SINKS OF ATMOSPHERIC CARBON, BUT WHEN TRANSFORMED TO AGRICULTURAL LAND THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT C SOURCES. IN ADDITION, MIRES CAN BE USED AS ARCHIVES FOR RECONSTRUCTING LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION. WE EXPLORED IN MORE DETAIL THE DYNAMICS OF THE LANDSCAPE OF THE THREE LAKES REGION WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE FORMATION AND DEGRADATION OF MIRES. THE BERNESE PART OF THE THREE LAKES REGION DEVELOPED TO BECOME-AFTER THE OPTIMISATION OF THE WATER-LEVELS OF THE SWISS JURA-THE VEGETABLE BELT OF SWITZERLAND. THE SITUATION FOR AGRICULTURE, HOWEVER, HAS NOW BECOME CRITICAL DUE TO AN OVEREXPLOITATION OF THE PEATLAND. UNTIL C. 13 KA BP THE ENTIRE REGION WAS HYDROLOGICALLY CONNECTED. AN ADDITIONAL LAKE EXISTED AT THE WESTERN END OF THE PLAIN RECEIVING SEDIMENTS FROM THE AARE RIVER. AROUND 13 KA BP, THIS LAKE WAS ISOLATED FROM THE AARE RIVER AND COMPLETELY SILTED UP UNTIL C. 10 KA BP WHEN A MIRE STARTED TO FORM. IN THE VALLEY FLOOR ('GROSSES MOOS'), THE MEANDERING AARE AND THE VARYING LEVEL OF THE NEARBY LAKE OF NEUCHATEL CAUSED A SPATIO-TEMPORALLY PATCHY FORMATION OF MIRES (START OF FORMATION: 10-3 KA BP). STRONG MORPHODYNAMICS HAVING HIGH EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION RATES AND A HIGH VARIABILITY OF THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE DEPOSITED MATERIAL PREVAILED DURING THE EARLY HOLOCENE UNTIL C. 7.5 KA BP. THE SITUATION REMAINED RELATIVELY QUIET BETWEEN 5 AND 2 KA BP. HOWEVER, DURING THE LAST 2000 YEARS THE HYDRODYNAMIC AND GEOMORPHIC ACTIVITIES HAVE INCREASED AGAIN. THE OPTIMISATION OF THE SWISS JURA WATER-LEVELS DURING THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURIES ENABLED THE TRANSFORMATION OF MOORLAND INTO ARABLE LAND.
